PREFACE 
WE appear to have applied psychology to the teaching 
of every subject except psychology itself. In this direc- 
tion, there is large room for development. One of the 
chief purposes of this book is to present psychology psycho- 
logically. 
Usually, all the student’s work before beginning this 
subject has been objective. To plunge him headlong into 
subjective phenomena is too much like the method of teach- 
ing swimming by throwing the learner overboard. “From 
the known to the unknown”’: the old rule holds. 
The method here adopted consists in (1) passing from the 
familiar picture of man in his common environment to a 
study, with genetic sidelights, of “Body, Brain, and Mind,” 
(2) showing the relation of adjustment between “The 
Mental and the Environmental,” and (3) explaining, in 
the study of “Mind, Nervous System, and Behavior,” 
how the neuro-mental governing and steering system ac- 
complishes its complex task of adjustment. In this way 
we complete the sensori-motor circle, inward from body to 
mind, outward from mind to behavior. 
The frequently found plan of isolating the discussion of 
the nervous system in a separate chapter has not been 
followed. Such knowledge is better assimilated and applied 
if presented in direct connection with the most closely 
related mental facts. ra

   PREFACE 
In Part One, which gives an airplane view of the entire 
science, causing its larger features to stand out, there are 
developed a few simple laws which, applied throughout 
the book, effectively organize and simplify the whole com- 
plex subject. 
Part Two shows a nearer and more detailed view of the 
facts, such facts as teachers most need to know. The final 
chapters synthesize what might otherwise remain frag- 
mentary knowledge, into a unified study of personality, 
mental hygiene, and mental efficiency. 
My debts are too many to mention — save one, that to 
my wife, my kindest and most merciless critic.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
TueE laws of teaching are based upon the science of psy- 
chology. Curricula for the professional training of teachers 
have long included courses in this science. During the 
past fifteen or twenty years very great advance has been 
made by means of investigations in this field. The results 
that have accrued have, in part, been unavailable for teach- 
ers because of the general nature of the treatises on psy- 
chology. The need has been for a book which would bring 
to bear upon the problems of teaching the principles of 
psychology and their special applications as they have 
been derived by recent investigations. This book fulfills 
this need in a remarkable degree. 
The author has presented for teachers in the first part 
of the volume a broad outline of the subject in a way that 
will give the teacher a feeling of confidence in dealing with 
the more detailed study which follows. In presenting the 
applications of psychology to the problems of teaching, 
Dr. La Rue has proved himself a skillful teacher. It will 
be observed that the study of any particular principle 
begins with the statement of a problem to be solved, and 
that the subject under consideration is developed with a 
wealth of illustration and with a degree of concreteness in 
presentation that is most unusual. At the end of each 
chapter are topics for further study, and exercises to be 
solved as a means of testing the reader’s knowledge and 
his ability to apply the principles which have been discussed.

  8 EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Everywhere the author emphasizes the application of 
the psychological principle to teaching. Students in normal 
schools or colleges, or teachers at work in classrooms will 
find in the pages of this text, not only an interpretation of 
the fundamentals of teaching practices, but also many help- 
ful suggestions for the solution of the actual difficulties 
encountered in their profession.

THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGY 
Exercises. — 1. Before reading this chapter, write what you can 
on the topic, ‘‘ What Psychology Means to Me.” Include a state- 
ment of what you think psychology should do for you as a teacher. 
2. Write a few paragraphs on the subject, “ What I Thought and 
How I Felt When...” Let the ‘‘ When ”’ introduce some event 
that affected you considerably. Perhaps ‘‘ When I First Spoke in 
Public ” would serve well. 
“What is psychology like?” “ What is it good for? ” 
These are the questions in your mind as you open this book 
or enter the psychology classroom. ‘In your mind ” — 
that takes us into psychology at once: for everybody has 
heard the rumor that psychology is the study of mind. 
The place of psychology among other branches. — We 
can group all branches of study in a simple plan, as shown 
in the figure. Psychology falls in with science. But 
there are two kinds of science, physical and mental. 
Physical science deals with the world as it would be 
without mind init. For example, when you study Physical 
Geography, you study a mindless world of rock and wave, 
storm and sun, volcanoes and vegetation. Psychology has 
no place there.

of thoughts and feelings 
in general., Psychology 
is an extremely personal 
science. In fact, we may 
almost call it the science 
of personality. 
Biology and physiol- 
ogy are the physical sci- 
ences which lie nearest 
to psychology and influ- 
ence it most. Biology 
is the science of life. Now, there can be life without mind; 
at least, such minds as ours. Plants, insects, and our own 
sleeping, mindless but living bodies, are examples of it. 
But there can be no mind without life. So far as we can 
see, life is necessary as a supporter of mind. 
The sciences may well be pictured as 
resting on each other in layers, strata, | PSYCHOLOGY 
stories, with physics forming the founda- 
tion. But if psychology is the top story 
of the sciences, it is not a mere garret, a 
dark stow-hole for ghosts, hypnotism, and 
spiritualism. It is as orderly and well kept 
as any other scientific suite; its elevation PHYSIOLOGY

  gives it a wide view; and it opens to the PHYSICS 
free sky, to the larger truths of life.
-P-A-G-E-15
Se. THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGY PS 
Physiology and psychology have some ground in common ; 
in fact, it is not always easy to tell where one leaves off 
and the other begins. There is even a dispute as to whether 
psychology is not properly a part of physiology. We shall 
probably be unable to settle this dispute until we have 
more knowledge. If we should stop breathing for ten 
minutes in order to observe what would happen, we, our 
minds, would no longer be there to observe. So, too much 
or too little food, or. work, or play, or sleep, changes our 
minds so much that, if we could photograph them as we 
do our faces, we should not recognize ourselves. 
How to find the nature of a science. — Whenever we 
find any work going on — for example, men building some- 
thing — we can learn the nature of it from the answers to 
a few very simple but very important questions: 1. What 
is the one big purpose of the whole business? What is it 
for? 2. With what kind of material are the workers 
busy? 3. What is their method of work? 4. Finally, 
what comes out of it? What good is it? 
So, whenever we find a body of scientists busy at build- 
ing a science, we can learn its nature by finding out these 
four characteristics :   
1. - Purpose. 
2. Subject matter. 
3- Method of investigating. 
4. Results. 
We shall learn the nature of psychology by studying 
these four features of it. But before we take up the purpose 
of this particular science, let us glance at the “ why ” of 
science in general.
-P-A-G-E-16
  16 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
The purpose of science in general.— Why do we, the 
human race, study science? Because we want to live 
successfully, and the highway of science is the road to 
success. 
Nature is at once our best friend and our worst enemy. 
She supports us; but she also destroys us. She indiffer- 
ently furnishes our food, wrecks us with disease, provides 
us with fuel, terrorizes us with flood and earthquake and 
other disasters. 
But she is orderly, regular, systematic, works “ accord- 
ing to law,” as we say. And science is just our effort to 
find out that law. In this way, we gradually get control 
of food supply, fuel, clothing, building materials, disease 
germs, and other determiners of our happiness and misery. 
And though our puny strength is insufficient to control 
the greater forces, such as those that cause climate, storm, 
flood, and earthquake, yet through science we are becom- 
ing wise enough to predict what is going to happen, and to 
shape our course accordingly. 
The purpose of science in general, then, is prediction 
and control of events, as a means to human happiness. 
Of course, there are those who follow science for the sake 
of science, just as others follow “ art for art’s sake.” So- 
ciety, however, expects from science, not merely the 
pleasure of the scientist, but a contribution toward better 
living. 
Purpose of psychology. — Psychology aims to predict 
and to control mental events. When a child is born, we 
wish to predict, from our knowledge of its ancestors, what 
kind of mind it will develop. As the child grows older, 
both parents and teachers want to control its mental opera- ‘
-P-A-G-E-17
THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGY 7 
tions. Many a teacher fails to keep order; and yet 
discipline is a matter of psychological control. The 
physician needs to understand the mind of his patient; 
the minister, the sin-sick soul; the lawyer, his client and 
his witness; the salesman, his customer; the wife, her 
husband; the husband, his wife; the orator, his audience ; 
the statesman, his people; and Everyman, how to control 
himself: for “ better is he that ruleth his spirit than he 
that taketh a city.” 
Subject matter of psychology. — The subject matter of 
psychology consists of thoughts and feelings — using these

Fic. 2. — Showing how mind stands between stimulus and reaction. 
  terms rather loosely. These thoughts and feelings stand 
between what is done to us and what we do in return. 
Let us picture the world and the individual as in the figure 
(Fig. 2). “ What the world does to you” that arouses 
your thoughts and feelings, is called a stimulus. “ What 
you do in return” is your reaction. Thoughts and feel- 
ings form a very important link between stimulus and 
reaction. 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  18 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
For example, an old friend passes you on the street, with 
averted gaze. If you feel this as a slight, you may take 
social vengeance, cut him off your party list; but if you 
think his eye chanced to miss you, you hail him at next 
* meeting as cordially as ever. 
Psychology is made more interesting by the varied 
reactions of different individuals. Punish one pupil, and 
he thinks it over and reforms. Another feels that you 
have personally insulted him, vents his spite on you, and 
behaves worse than ever. A third seems too callous and 
stupid to think or feel anything. 
Branches of psychology. — Mind of some sort is found 
in creatures of many kinds, and under a variety of condi- 
tions, sane, insane, aged, infantile, human, animal, and so on. 
The study of all these types gives rise to a number of kinds 
of psychology, which Yerkes ' has arranged in an ingenious 
diagram, as below. 
Normal —— Adult —— Human—— Individual

Each term in the upper line is contrasted with the one 
directly below it. To name the various branches of 
psychology, start-at the left and pass toward the right along 
any horizontal or oblique lines until you have included 
four terms. Thus, the psychology of the normal, adult, 
human individual is ordinary, “ general” psychology, 
just what we are now beginning. The psychology of the

  THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGY 19 
normal, young, human group, is the psychology of children 
as they work or play together. 
In addition to all these divisions, there are other branches 
of psychology which answer special purposes. So, physio- 
logical psychology traces the relations between physiology 
and psychology; comparative psychology compares the 
minds of various animals including humans, perhaps; 
genetic psychology shows the genesis, or development from 
the beginning, of mind in an individual, or a species, or 
even the whole worldful of living creatures. Very im- 
portant for the teacher is educational psychology, which 
traces the laws of the growing mind and helps us to adapt 
the lesson to the learner. 
Method in psychology. — The general method of find- 
ing out truth is the same in all sciences. The process con- 
sists of three very large and important steps: 
1. Get the facts. 
2. Form a theory. 
3. Test the theory. 
Take an example. The water in your pitcher is sometimes 
warm, sometimes cool, to your hands, when you can find 
no cause for its changing temperature. 
1. You collect facts, take the temperature of the water 
with a thermometer, note whether your hands were warm 
or cool just before being immersed, etc. 
2. After careful thought, you conclude that water of 
unchanging temperature seems warm or cool according 
to the temperature of the hand that enters it. 
3. Asa test, you hold your right hand in cold water, the 
left in hot water, for a few minutes, then plunge both into
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
water that is lukewarm. It seems warm to the right hand, 
cold to the left. 
This is a simple illustration of the general method of 
investigation followed in all sciences — first facts, then 
thinking, theorizing, and back to the facts again. 
Of course, the facts are always acquired by observation. 
And just here is what makes psychology seem “ queer ” 
on first acquaintance: probably all the other sciences you 
have studied — geography, botany, and so on have 
directed your observation to things outside of you, to 
flowers, rivers, rocks, to what-is-not-you. Even physiology 
gets no farther than your body. But now, you shall ob- 
serve what goes on in your mind — your thoughts and 
feelings, your mental self. It is somewhat as if a camera, 
having hitherto centered all its efforts on photographing 
everything around it, should begin to take pictures of what 
goes on within. 
The mind’s observation of itself is called introspection. 
There is no great mystery or difficulty about it... Ask a 
small boy if he is hungry, and he must introspect before 
he can tell you truly. [very time you answer the question, 
How do you feel, or describe your symptoms for your 
physician, you do it by introspection. If you performed 
the experiment with the three bowls of water, as described 
above, you found your verdict as to the temperature of 
the water by introspection. There is no one who does not 
observe his mind, in some fashion, carelessly or carefully, 
every day. Psychology simply requires that you observe 
1 “The most frequent impediment to men’s turning their minds inward 
upon themselves, is that they are afraid of what they shall find there.” 
S. T. Coleridge, Aids to Reflection, p. 124.
-P-A-G-E-21
    THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGY 2r 
mind carefully, just as botany demands that you observe 
plants carefully. 
Results of psychological investigation. — Perhaps the 
chief result of studying psychology has been to convince 
us that there can be results. Mind is no longer regarded 
as a sealed mystery, an irresponsible, self-sufficient thing, 
defiant of law. We should be greatly surprised if fire 
burned us to-day and froze us to-morrow: the natural world 
“works by law.” Mind, too, works by law. “I chanced 
to think,” you say. “No,” interrupts the psychologist ; 
“not if you mean that it really happened by chance; for 
nothing ever happens by chance in the mind any more than 
it does outside the mind.’”’” And he proceeds to explain 
to you the laws of your thinking. True, his range and ac- 
curacy of prediction and control are not yet so great as in 
certain other sciences. This is partly because psychology 
is young as yet, partly because its facts are often complex 
and difficult to get at. 
One of the chief results, then, is that science, entering 
the last corner of the universe to be explored, the mental 
corner, finds everything orderly, regular, systematic here, 
as elsewhere. 
If we look for the more practical, everyday benefits of 
psychologic study, the chief difficulty is, not to find them, 
but to find any human situation where they are not, or 
at least, cannot be. In home life, in court, in asylum, 
church, schoolroom — in all personal culture and in all 
social usefulness, this science of mental personality is help- 
ing us to deal with persons.
-P-A-G-E-22

CLASS EXPERIMENTS 
The purpose of these exercises is to get practice in introspection. 
1. The instructor will announce some simple task, such as, ‘‘ Write 
the alphabet backward.’’ Each will observe and report on the way 
his mind works during the process. 
2. Let the instructor display together several full-page advertise- 
ments (perhaps mounted on cardboard). Each will select the best- 
liked and the least-liked. Report of reasons for likes and dislikes. 
What practical help is there here for the advertiser ? ! 
3. Outside of class, let each make some small purchase, noting 
the effect on him of the store, its lighting, cleanliness, arrangement ; 
the clerk’s courtesy or lack of it; the appearance of the package and 
the quality of the goods. 
Class report and discussion. “Shall you buy there again?” 
Why or why not? : 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Write ten questions which you think psychology should answer. 
2, Arrange two columns, headed “ Physical” and “ Mental,” 
respectively. Make a number of entries in each. Compare the two 
sets of entries and try to make statements about them. 
3. If the study of animals is included in physical geography, is 
there then anything mental about it? Try to prove your answer. 
4. Try to find some difference between life and mind. If one 
loses his mind, is that the same as losing his life? 
5. State the purpose, subject matter, method of investigating, 
and the chief results, of some science you have studied. 
6. Philosophy is an attempt to gain a comprehensive, unified 
view of the universe. Do you think psychology has any more to do 
with it than has any other branch? 
1 After trial of these advertisements on a few classes (totaling, say, 100 
students) the teacher will be able to state in advance which will stand first, 
which last, in the choice of succeeding classes — a simple case of psycho- 
logical prediction.

7. Predict what answer you will get from a friend if you ask him 
a certain question — perhaps whether his candidate will win the next 
election. Try it out, telling him nothing of your purpose. Compare 
the result with your prediction. 
8. One author, on reading the first part only of another’s book, 
has been known to predict correctly how the characters would turn 
out. How is this possible? 
9. Novelists assert that a character, once he is introduced, in- 
sists on behaving as he will — the author cannot control him. How 
is this? 
to. Describe, that is, name, according to Yerkes’ scheme, the 
psychology of an old man; of a lamb; of a group of insane men and 
women ; of a mob; of your psychology class. 
11. Look up the derivation of the word introspection. Do the 
meanings of its roots seem to you to fit the case? 
12. What advantage is there, when one is ill, in being a skilled 
introspector ? 
13. “Just put yourself in my place and tell me what you would 
do.” Is this possible? If so, what does it require? 
14. Describe some experience of your early school days. Of 
what use is it to a teacher to be able to bring back his own school 
experience vividly by introspection ? 
15. Observe the influence of work, play, sleep, eating, deep breath- 
ing, etc., on your mental condition, and report what you find. 
16. Picture the world as it would be if suddenly deprived of all 
scientific knowledge. 
17. Are there any difficulties in observing thoughts and feelings, 
that are not found when we observe the outside world? 
18. Is psychology any more closely connected with teaching than 
it is with preaching, or practicing law? 
19. State differences you have observed in people with regard to 
spending money, attending church, studying, pleasure-seeking, pay- 
ing attention to the other sex, etc. What do you think psychology 
can do in the way of prediction and control here? 
20. Working either alone or in class, make a summary, for your 
notebook, of the facts in this chapter which you think it worth while 
to memorize. Try to write short, crisp, meaningful sentences.

BODY, BRAIN, AND MIND 
“ The centipede was happy, quite, 
Until the toad, for fun, 
Said, ‘ Pray, which leg comes after which? ” 
This worked her mind to such a pitch 
She lay distracted in the ditch, 
Considering how to run.” 
Exercise. — Do you believe the centipede ever spends any time 
considering how to run? What do you think as to its moving each 
leg with deliberation? What keeps the legs moving with such 
regularity and speed? Where or what is the controlling apparatus ? 
What could you do to the centipede so as to interfere with its leg 
movements without injuring the legs themselves? If you know of 
any lower animals or human beings that have suffered loss of move- 
ment in any part without direct injury to that part, tell of such 
cases. 
Do you think the centipede ever tries to explain your movements 
as you do its running? Why? Would it have more or less to ex- 
plain? What is the chief difference between you and a centipede 
so far as behavior is concerned ? 
The body is like a city. — One who carelessly observes a 
city may regard it as a confused collection of corners, big 
buildings, streets full of people and vehicles, cars, noises, 
and bumps. But as he studies the chaos, he finds it com- 
posed of systems, working, for the most part, harmoniously. 
First of all, a city must be fed. Consequently, it has 
some sort of feeding system; food enters from somewhere 
and is laid before the buyer in store or market. Further, 
since people must get about and goods must be transported, 
25
-P-A-G-E-26

26 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
a transportation system is necessary, streets, car, lines, 
taxicabs, delivery wagons. To dispose of the waste, there 
is a sewage system. Over all, there is a system of govern- 
ment. If this governing system is efficient, it receives 
quick news from everywhere and enforces its ordinances 
from center to suburb in the interest of all. 
So, a human body, at careless glance, may seem a plan- 
less collection of parts; but physiology shows us that it 
is a well-organized group of systems, a system of systems. 
Man as a group of systems. — Man, like every other 
living creature, is first of all a feeder, an eater; hence his 
digestive system. To carry the digested food about the 
body requires a circulatory system. To keep the blood 
stream of the circulatory system pure, there is a respiratory, 
or breathing system. To remove waste matter, we are 
provided with an excretory system — lungs, skin, and 
kidneys. And since nature has not made the body im- 
mortal, it must reproduce its kind; hence the reproductive, 
or sexual system. 
These five systems, digestive, circulatory, respiratory, 
excretory, and reproductive, are often called the vegetative 
systems, because they are all found, in some form, in plants. 
Plants feed, circulate their sap, breathe, excrete waste 
matter, and reproduce their kind. Perhaps it is more en- 
lightening to call these five systems the supporting, or 
maintenance systems, because they merely support, or 
maintain, the bodily machine. They simply enable the 
plant or animal to keep alive so long as conditions are 
favorable. But as they do the inside work only, of the 
body, they do not put it in touch with the great world out- 
side. In fact, a creature that has maintenance systems 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
BODY, BRAIN, AND MIND 27 
only, such as a geranium, does not even know that there 
is an outside world, an environment on which its life ab- 
solutely depends. 
Now, most animals have two more systems, most im- 
portant of all to us as psychologists. These are the mus- 
cular and the nervous system. If the conservatory be- 
comes cool, the cat goes elsewhere to find warmth; but 
the geranium sits still and quietly freezes to death. Why? 
Because it has no muscular system and so can not move 
itself about. But further, it lacks the animal nervous 
system, and so does not know that it is cold, or have any 
wish to move about. 
These two systems, the muscular and the nervous, are 
sometimes. called the animal systems because (speaking 
generally and roughly) animals have them and plants do 
not. It is better, perhaps, to call them the adaptive sys- 
tems, because they enable the animal to adapt itself to 
its surroundings. So the cat leaves the cold conservatory 
and hunts a warmer environment. But we, having better 
nerves and muscles than the cat, can surpass her in power 
of adaptation, can succeed better — for that is what adapta- 
tion amounts to: we do not go to the heat, but bring it 
to ourselves by turning the damper of our furnace. 
As teachers, we are especially interested in the adaptive 
systems, for we may almost say the pupil 7s his nerves and 
muscles. The nervous system feels, experiences, what the 
world does to him; his muscular system carries out, vigor- 
ously or weakly, skillfully or clumsily, his reaction. Given 
good nerve and muscle and we have a good pupil. And 
if we ever succeed in educating him, it will be by training 
his adaptive systems, in other words, his success systems,

his nervo-muscular or (as it is more commonly called) 
neuro-muscular apparatus. For instance, when we teach a 
child to write, we first print on his brain a picture of the 
letters and the movements he is to make, and then train 
his muscles to make them. This process goes on as long 
as we learn — and that should be as long as we live: the 
world beats its lessons into our brains, and we in turn try 
to show by what we do, by the use we make of our muscular 
systems, that we amount to something in the world, and 
can perhaps even influence its tough constitution. 
The nervous system is the governing System of the 
body. — As in a city all departments are subject to the 
city government, so in the body all other. systems are 
subject to the nervous system. Stomach, heart, lungs, 
muscles — every part of the body reports to it; and from 
it are sent out nearly all orders for the transaction of the 
body’s business. Even to sense a fly on one’s cheek and 
to swat him for his impudent invasion, brings actively into 
play some part of this supreme system of the body. 
And not only does the nervous system suffer with the 
others, as when a decayed tooth or an inflamed lung causes 
pain; and rejoice with the others, as when we “ feel fine 
all over’; but it teaches all the other systems, gives them 
training and discipline so far as they are capable of re- 
ceiving it. For example, if we wish to form the habit of 
deep breathing, it is the brain that drills the lungs into their 
proper habit. But, speaking generally, the behavior of 
the maintenance systems can not be changed very much: 
heart, lungs, and stomach, behave about the same at death 
as they did at birth. Not so with the-adaptive systems: 
it is chiefly in muscle and brain that the adult differs from

the child. Yet all nicety of muscular action merely pictures 
for us the fine performance of the brain cells, boxed out of 
sight in the skull. 
To teach a child is to change his nervous system so as to 
make it work better. The aim of education is the production 
of the best possible nervous system. 
What if there were no nervous system? — To find out 
what a thing is good for, take it away and see what happens. 
Let us consider an animal to 
which nature has given no nery- 
ous tissue. 
The sponge (see the figure) is 
such an animal. In the numerous 
pores that lead from the outside 
of its body to the large cavity 
within, are many cilia, or hairlike 
muscles, which lash the water and 
cause it to flow inward. Ordi- 
narily, it then passes out through 
™~... the opening at the top. Around 
Fic. 4.—Diagram of asponge. this opening is a muscle which, 
when stimulated, contracts and prevents the water from 
escaping. Yet, in such a case, the cilia go on thrashing the 
water and vainly trying to force it inward. This is as 
foolish as if a man should try to build a brick wall by 
laying up bricks with one hand and pulling them down 
with the other. If man had no nervous system, he would 
probably try, sometimes, to walk in opposite directions 
with his two legs, or start a fight between his two fists.

mains fixed to one spot, as the sponge does, has less need

of an adaptive system than does one that undertakes to 
guide itself freely about its environment and find its food. 
Such a creature, without sense organs, would bump into 
its surroundings and flounder into danger on every hand, 
to say nothing of missing many a good meal. Nature’s 
way of meeting this emergency is to develop around the 
bumping spots and the food-finding end of the animal, 
cells sensitive enough to re- 
ceive impressions from the 
environment, in other words, 
nerve cells. These nerve cells 
enable it to get advance news 
of whatever is about, flee the 
bad and seek the good. 
The jellyfish is one of the 
humblest creatures that at- 
tempt to explore the environ- 
ment in this way. It lacks

tive cells around the rim of W, a ring of nervous tissue; R, a 
its body and in its tentacles. semse-organ for touch; T, tentacle; 
aie M, mouth stalk. 
From these sensitive cells, Ree 
nerve fibers branch off, forming a nerve-net that runs all 
through its muscular system. Whenever one of these sensi- 
tive cells is stimulated, a nerve thrill, or impulse, runs from 
it through the nerve fibers to the surrounding muscles. The 
stronger the stimulation, the farther the impulse travels, 
until all the muscles of the body are set into motion. The 
result is that, whether swimming or feeding, all its muscles 
work well together, are well codrdinated — quite a con- 
trast to the sponge.
-P-A-G-E-32
32 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
It is evident that the nervous system controls, whether 
in jellyfish or man, by connecting and unifying the various 
parts of the body. 
But the jellyfish is a stupid creature, after all. It has 
no brain. 
How we came to have brains. — We are all descended 
from a simple, wormlike creature. The segments of our 
backbone are memorials of the segments 
of its body. At first, these segments 
were largely independent, each having 
its own sensori-motor arcs, that is, 
“arches ” of nerve running from sense 
organ to muscle, and each its own 
ganglion! (See the figure.) But such 
an animal has to move; and it is not 
round, like a jellyfish, and so it cannot 
strike off indifferently in any direction: 
it has ends, and one of these ends must 
go first. Since the creature is moving 
largely to find food, it is natural that 
the mouth end should go ahead. Now, 
this roaming mouth needs the best 
guidance possible. What better place

reports food in front of the animal, a nerve thrill must pass 
from that eye to every body-moving muscle to insure full 
speed ahead. And there must be an equally widespread 
distribution of nerve impulses to secure united action of all 
muscles in beating a retreat. Now, all this means mul- 
tiplication of connections, of nerve fibers, and as we should 
expect, most of them appear in the most convenient place, 
near the sense organs, in the head. So begins the brain. 
Thus there come to be grouped, in and about the bony- 
armored head, the mouth, the special sense organs, and the 
brain. To sum up: the mouth end of the animal not only 
goes ahead, but grows a head, with a brain in it, and set 
round with the most delicate and precious sense organs.! 
What does the brain do? — The brain is the master 
ganglion of the body, the chief member of the most im- 
portant bodily system, the governing system, the steering 
system. We can sum up its business pretty well under 
two heads: 
«1. It stores experience.? 
2. It gives every part of the body the direct benefit of 
this stored experience. 
1. This stored experience takes the form of memory — 
using the term in a wide sense. The brainless jellyfish 
probably has no idea of what he did yesterday. He reacts 
to each knock of his environment without knowing whether 
the same visitor ever knocked before. Not so man: the 
records of his experience lie there in his brain cells, as the 
life records of the city are found in the archives of its 
1See W. McDougall, Physiological Psychology, pp. 18, 19. 
2 Of course, this is.a figure of speech. It is much like saying that a 
phonograph record “stores” the music which it can reproduce. 
 
-P-A-G-E-34

council chambers. This is precisely why he can be edu- 
cated so easily and induced to shift his course to fit the 
future. But any teacher would have hard labor trying to 
discipline and instruct a school of jellyfish ! 
2. In the jellyfish, there is not only no central office 
of intelligence, but there is no switchboard method of con- 
necting organ with organ directly. If a nerve impulse 
starts at any point, it has no private wire on which to travel, 
but must spread, like rumor on a country telephone, where- 
ever the wires are open. The human brain is a switch- 
board wherein hundreds of millions of “ wires,” that is, 
nerve paths, shift their messages. 
Now, learning anything is just a matter of making new 
paths, or perfecting old ones, in the nervous system, es- 
pecially the brain. A man who had been brought up in 
the East, took a trip to that part of the West where cactus 
is abundant. One day, losing himself in the pursuit of 
some creature he was trying to capture, he pushed vigor- 
ously into the midst of an equally vigorous cactus bush. 
Said he, ‘“‘ That sharp experience taught me to let the cacti 
alone. I never assaulted a cactus bush after that.” This 
means that the sight of a cactus ever after discharged his 
brain currents over a new path and made his muscles carry 
him away from the bush instead of into it. 
A child sees a candle for the first time and touches it. 
(See the figure.) This means that a nervous impulse runs 
from the eye to C, the candle cell, and out to the muscles 
of arm and hand. The resulting burn sends in another 
nervous current which thrills both C and B, the burn cell, 
at once, and so sets up a path between them. Next time 
the child sees a candle, the impulse which arouses C passes
-P-A-G-E-35
BODY, BRAIN, AND MIND 35 
to B also, causing him to remember the burn and restrain 
the natural tendency to touch. 
Here is stored experience, made available by improved 
switchboard connections, for the protection of the body. 
Had these individuals had the 
nervous system of a jellyfish, 
they would have gone on blun- 
dering into danger many times 
more. 
The nervous system exercises 
two kinds of 
control. — When

nothing of his 
heart’s beating 
or his breathing; he may even have said something with- 
out knowing it. Yet his nervous system controlled all 
these matters, too. Here was (2) unconscious, automatic 
control. 
Some of the lower animals exhibit automatic control to a

nicety. Competent observers assure me that chickens 
are sometimes known to run when their heads have been 
removed. Certainly, a creature so low as the centipede 
does so readily. Cut off a centipede’s head while the animal 
is running, and its hundred legs, bearing the headless body, 
run on without confusion. Cut its length into several 
fractions, and each fraction does the same. If the head- 
less body meets a low obstacle, it mounts over the ob- 
struction; if a high one, it is stalled dead against it, but 
still the legs keep up their motion. Cut the ventral cord, 
a cable of nerves corresponding to our spinal cord, thus

severing all nervous connection between head and hind 
legs, and the front legs will have one motion while the 
hinder ones show another. The reason, of course, is that 
the tiny brain still controls the front legs, while the rear 
ones are directed by their own ganglia only. If the cut 
is so placed that this rear portion of the body is the larger 
and stronger, it may even carry the head where that head 
does not at all want to go.! 
Now, the psychologist is interested in behavior of all 
sorts,, but more especially in consciously controlled be- 
havior, and most especially in the consciousness, the

-P-A-G-E-37
BODY, BRAIN, AND MIND 37 
thoughts and feelings, the mind which does the con- 
trolling. Where is the mind found? 
Mind dwells in the brain. — The mind, sometimes called 
the soul, has been variously located by different observers, 
in the breath, in the heart, and elsewhere, sometimes in 
the body as a whole. “ Joseph’s bowels yearned for his 
brethren’; “bowels of compassion”; ‘“ Cupid’s dart 
has pierced my heart”; ‘hot-blooded”; “ white- 
livered””; “spleeny”’; these and many other phrases 
suggest that the mind is located in, or strongly influenced 
by, certain bodily organs. 
~ When we touch an object, we may even feel that we are 
in the hand, doing the touching. But if we cut the nerves 
between hand and brain, we no longer “ feel’ it when the 
hand makes contact with objects; and though we can 
determine to move the hand, we are unable to do so. Yet 
the brain can still think of the hand; and if we stimulate 
the cut end of the nerve leading to the brain, we get sensa- 
tions that seem to be in the hand. And this is true even 
when the whole hand has been cut off. The hand-ex- 
perience, then, is really in the brain. 
This explains the many stories of a phantom limb, 
wherein the owner of the limb seems to be conscious of it, 
or even tries to use it, after it has been amputated: the 
brain continues to behave as it got into the habit of be- 
having while the limb was attached. 
There are at least two great lines of evidence that make us 
believe the mind is in the brain. These are (1) brain devel- 
opment and (2) brain pathology (injury, disease, or decay). 
(x) In general, mind and brain develop together. Man, 
the first of all animals in mental development, excels also

in complexity of brain, and (with a few exceptions) in 
brain weight as compared with body weight.! 
(2) A surgeon can open one’s skull and, by moderate 
pressure on the brain, cause consciousness to vanish. If 
he removes a certain center in the back part of the brain, 
the owner of it cannot see, though his eyes are unharmed, 
and he is still “in his senses,” — the remainder of them. 
An inflamed brain may cause insanity; a bloodless one, 
fainting. When the brain shrinks and decays because of 
old age, the mind also is affected. 
These, and a host of other similar facts, convince us that 
the mind dwells in the brain. :

feel that there is quite a contrast between winds, rivers, and 
stars on the one hand, and on the other, the mind that ob- 
serves all these things and thinks about them. A few of the 
points in such a contrast may be summed up as below:

The mental pictures the environmental.— We have 
seen that it is the business of the brain to store experience 
and hold it ready to use when needed for guidance. Were 
it not so, no one of us would know the way home. Now, 
experience consists largely of pictures of the environment. 
Let me ask you the way to your home, or your room, or the 
next town, and you probably find pictures of the turning 
points flashing through your mind. 
As a psychologist, you must learn to make a sharp dis- 
tinction between natural objects and your experience of 
those objects. Either may perish while the other survives. 
You carved your name on a tree years ago. The tree may 
be gone but the experience is still stored in your brain. 
Or perhaps you have entirely forgotten the toy which your 
mother keeps, and with which, as she tells you, you played 
in childhood. The object survives the old experience. 
You are sitting at your study table. Close your eyes 
and you can still “ see ” the table there before you, as the 
child in school looks away from his spelling book and spells 
off a word from his mental photograph of it. So you can 
picture your home, or the ocean, or the “ spacious firmament 
on high.” Now, your experience is in your brain, but all 
these other things are not, any more than they are in the 
camera that photographs them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE MENTAL AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL 43 
Objective and subjective. — The psychological terms 
used to indicate the contrast between nature and human 
nature are objective and subjective. Objective refers to the 
object world, the world of nature; it means “ pertaining 
to the object experienced.” Subjective refers to human 
nature, and means “ pertaining to the experience itself.” 
So, your thought of home is subjective; the home (house) 
itself, objective. Your teeth are objective, your tooth- 
ache, subjective. 
We.can always decide between the subjective and the 
objective by this simple test: Could the thing in question, 
under any circumstances, be observed by others, as even 
one’s heart or stomach might be? or is it, like my thought 
or my heartache, observable by me only? Whatever could 
be thrown open to the inspection of all is objective; that 
which can be observed by introspection only, is sub- 
jective. 
When in doubt as to whether a light or a sound is “ real ” 
or imaginary, we turn naturally to our companions and 
ask whether they see or hear it. Students often inquire 
whether Banquo’s ghost was “ really there.” If several 
saw it, it was probably a real apparition — but not cer- 
tainly so; for sometimes a whole crowd sees something 
which has no objective existence. 
Psychology is the science of the subjective. — The 
subjective is the introspectable, and the introspectable 
is the mental. While there are other sciences, such as 
logic, that deal with mental facts in some measure, psy- 
chology is the only science whose purpose it is to describe 
and explain such facts in order to predict and control 
them.
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Introspection. — Now (as stated in Chapter I) intro- 
spection is psychological observation, the mind’s examina- 
tion of itself. Without this, there could be no science of 
psychology, as we know it. Whoever can not introspect, 
can scarcely enter the outer court of the science. His 
progress in it will be in direct proportion to his introspective 
ability. 
When a person undertakes to introspect, he should be, 
as Titchener says, (1) impartial, (2) attentive, (3) com- 
fortable, and (4) fresh. In fact, this should be true of all 
observation, outward or inward. But whereas there is 
no humiliation in telling the unvarnished truth about a 
stone or a flower, it sometimes hurts a little to report just 
what an impartial recording angel must see in our minds. 
We must brace up and tell the straight truth about our- 
selves, whether it exalts or abases. 
The introspective habit, if it does not become morbid, 
is of great help in all practical affairs. A school director, 
explaining why a certain teacher failed, said, ‘‘ She never 
seemed to be able to put herself in the pupil’s place.” 
Many teachers fail for this reason. Introspection enables 
teachers, as well as others, to put themselves “ in another’s 
place.” Among the Golden Sayings of Epictetus, we find 
this: ‘The husbandman deals with land; physicians 
and trainers with the body; the wise man with his own 
mind.” 
You can introspect an experience from the past, in so 
far as memory can repeat it for you; or from the present, 
while it is on the wing. Try the first: close your book, 
summon some experience from the past, such as your

triumph in a game, your fall from a bicycle, or some child- 
ish love, center your whole mind on it and go through it 
in detail. This takes time, but it is worth the effort to 
a psychologist." 
Now try a fresh experiment. Fix your eyes on the upper 
point of the ghost’s nose (Fig. 10) for about fifteen seconds, 
and then look off at a point on a 
light-colored wall or a sheet of 
white paper for a few seconds. 
Don’t let your gaze wander from 
either point. Make notes of your 
experience. 
What is mind? — Mind is hard 
to define, but if any one wants a 
concrete example, we can tell him, 
“Tt is just what you are when you 
ask about it.” 
However, introspection shows 
that mind is a stream of hap- 
penings — something coming and 
something going constantly. Ask a friend to tell you when 
two minutes are up, and during that time, let the mental 
stream flow on, and try to count the different things you 
think of. 
Mind, then, is not a thing, but a process. Things, speak- 
ing generally, remain unchanged, at least for a time, while 
a process is change. Water is a thing; the flow of water 
is a process. Air is a thing; wind, the movement of air, 
is a process. A wire is a thing; light, coming from a Fic. 10.— A Hallowe’en

kind.!. Just where the wind is when it is not blowing, 
where the light is when it is not shining, where the smiles 
are when we are not smiling, there, so far as we know, is 
where the mind is when it is not active, when we are not 
conscious. The mind of the dreamless sleeper has, for 
us, no existence, save as its “record” lies in the brain 
somewhat as the record of your phonograph music lies in 
the cabinet, ready for the next reproduction. 
Mind is a stream of experience that flows from stimulus 
to reaction. It may move in deeps or shallows, now with 
meandering drift, now with the direct rush of a torrent; 
but its general course, from babyhood to the end, is ever 
the same. 
The physical, the physiological, and the psychological. — 
Mind dwells in the brain, and so in the body ; and the body 
dwells in the big world called the environment. We can 
picture this by circles (see Fig. 11). Mind, the psy- 
chological, has a physiological environment, namely, the 
body. The body has an environment composed of what- 
ever you can point at around you, but which is, for the 
most part, physical.? 
1 Frequently, I shall use language which may seem to indicate that mind 
is nothing more than brain currents. I do not wish to imply anything about 
the relation between mind and brain. No one knows what that relation- 
ship is. But we are pretty sure that whenever the mind is active, there is 
corresponding brain activity. For brevity, then, and for the sake of pre- 
senting a concrete picture of the situation, I shall sometimes speak of brain 
thrills as if they were mental processes. 
2 Sometimes the word “physical” is used in a broad sense, and includes 
the physiological, as when we classify all things under two heads, physical 
and mental.
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE MENTAL AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL 47 
This physical world is full of energy, which beats the 
body constantly, as waves beat a ship. Things bump 
against us, heat waves roll at us without ceasing, sound 
waves pulse into the ear, and light waves vibrate through 
the eye. 
The nervous system has end organs, receptors (that is, 
receivers), commonly called sense organs, which, being 
sensitive to these 
waves of energy, 
receive them and 
convert them into 
nervous energy, 
nerve currents, 
somewhat as a 
telephone __ receiver 
catches the waves 
of your voice and 
converts them into 
an electric current. 
But the telephone 
cannot catch light 
or heat waves in 
this way, because it 
is not “tuned” to them. So, each kind of bodily receiver, 
or sense organ, has been likened to a lock which can be 
unlocked by one key only, that is, by the kind of energy 
stimulus it is made to receive. The ear takes in sounds, 
but not colors; and the eye, light but not sound. Quite 
likely much in this world escapes us: quite likely there are 
_ many kinds of energy waves, other colors, sounds, and so 
on, for which we have no sense organs.      ENVIRONMENT, PHYSICAL

Physical, physiological, and psychological sound. — 
Tap on your table and consider what happens. The 
vibrating table starts vibrations in the air. Such vibra- 
tions constitute physical sound. Most of us believe that 
physical sound would remain in the world even if we were 
all dead, or asleep, or had no ears. Winds and waterfalls 
would still start vibrations. 
Physical sound, when it reaches the ear, strikes a minute 
physiological harp and sets it to vibrating. This, in turn, 
sends through the nerve of hearing a thrill that reaches the 
brain. Such vibrations and thrills in ear and nerve consti- 
tute physiological sound. It cannot exist without an ear 
(or something like it); but most, if not all of it, can go on 
when one is asleep. 
But you, wide awake, tapping the table, enjoy a kind 
of sound which your sleeping roommate does not get: 
this is mental sound, conscious sound, sound as conscious- 
ness, psychological sound. Such sound would not exist 
if mind were swept out of the world. No one knows just 
how physiological sound is related to the psychological, 
just where the boundary is between the two, just how a 
nerve thrill can start anything in consciousness. 
Mind refers to the stream of experience from birth to 
death. Consciousness is mind at any moment, any cross- 
section of the stream of experience. A study conscious- 
ness differs from a theater consciousness, though both 
may be a part of the same mind at different times. But 
the two words are often used, roughly, as synonyms. 
The mind is often made to seem more mysterious than 
it really is. Those who wish to prove its spirituality some- 
times attempt to do so by saying that it has no weight,
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE MENTAL AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL 49 
occupies no space, etc. Neither does physical sound have 
weight or occupy space. Air and brains are things: they 
take room and have weight. Sound, of whatever kind, 
is a process. 
Beware of wandering words! —In psychology, it is 
especially necessary to know just what our words mean; 
for as a rule, we cannot point to what we are talking about, 
as we can in many other sciences. In particular, we must 
keep these three circles of meaning (see Fig. 11) distinct. 
“ Sound,” as indicated, may have any of three meanings. 
So may color, taste, smell, and the like. 
The brain is like a moving-picture factory. — The mental 
pictures the environmental, and the pictures are always 
moving. There is a striking similarity between the work 
of a moving-picture factory and that of the brain. 
The moving-picture maker must gather his pictures 
through lenses. If he did not expose his films, he would 
have no pictures. The brain must gather its experience — 
much of it — through the sense organs. If it were never 
“ exposed ” (stimulated) by their action, the mind would 
remain a blank — there would be no mind. 
The factory must store its films and bring them forth as 
needed. The brain stores experience and reproduces it 
on call. Both moving pictures and mental pictures may 
fade in time. 
The factory cuts up films into sections and from these 
old pieces makes “new” pictures. The brain analyzes 
our experience into bits and makes new combinations of 
the old bits. So you can (mentally) behead a horse and 
cut a man in two, attach the upper portion of the man to 
the body of the horse and make a centaur. When Praxit-

eles was asked to make a statue of Venus, he selected the 
most beautiful parts of the most beautiful female figures 
he could obtain as models, and then combined these parts 
into one harmonious whole. 
Finally, the moving pictures, good or bad, go out into 
the world. We express our mental pictures in our conduct.

The chief mental processes. — When the brain acts in 
a certain way, experience results. The brain is the in- 
strument, or organ, of experience. Mind, consciousness, is 
experience itself. The brain is the candle: mind is the flame. 
There are many names for various phases, aspects, parts, 
of experience, and it will be well to note two or three of 
them now. The general process of gathering experience 
through the sense organs is called perception. A perception 
ts a mental picture of an object present to the senses. You 
perceive the book you hold, for you are getting experience 
from it through your hands, which touch it, and your eyes, 
which see it. 
Stored experience takes the form of ideas. An idea is a 
mental picture of an object not present to the senses. 
Close your eyes, put down your book, and form a mental 
picture of it. This picture is an idea. So also is your 
mental picture of a fairy, which you have never perceived.
-P-A-G-E-51
THE MENTAL AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL St 
When stored experience is reproduced, the brain re- 
members. A memory is an experience recognized as re- 
produced. What were you doing yesterday at this time? 
Studying psychology, perhaps. But you recognize that 
experience as old: there is no danger of confusing it with 
to-day’s study. 
The feelings. — So far, we have spoken of the mind as 
if its whole work consisted in picturing the environment 
and guiding us safely about. And no doubt its chief and 
original business was to hold the mirror up to nature in 
this way. But mind includes some very important pro- 
cesses which we have purposely neglected so far, namely, 
our feelings, emotions, moods, and sentiments. Happi- 
ness, joy, grief, anger, “ the blues,” envy, love, patriotism 
— this sort of experience is the mainspring of life: it makes 
us act. And it does not come to us directly from the en- 
vironment, but is peculiarly our own. However, we shall 
find that perceptions and ideas lead; feeling follows. 
Later, we shall study feeling carefully. 
CLASS EXPERIMENTS 
The purpose of these experiments is to find how our minds work 
on certain problems. 
1. Let the instructor give a phrase or sentence, such as, “ ’Tis 
the last rose of summer, left blooming alone.” Each may write a 
description of the pictures which this calls into his mind. Com-

2. The instructor may give a word, such as ball, note, fire. Each 
will write this word and follow it with any ten other words that come 
tomind. Try to explain why each suggests the following. Compare 
the various lines of suggestion that stream from the common first 
word. Do they tell anything of the past lives of those who take part ?

CHAPTER IV 
MIND, NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND BEHAVIOR 
Exercise. — Set down a number (perhaps fifty) ‘“‘ Samples of My 
Behavior.”” Include all sorts, heart beat and unconscious wink, 
habitual tooth-brushing, etc., up to deliberately determined, thought- 
ful behavior. Try to classify them into three groups according to 
the amount of consciousness that lies back of each: some behavior 
can go on without consciousness, other samples may be accompanied 
by a kind of half-consciousness, while still others are directed by full, 
concentrated attention. Do you find any that may be in two or 
more classes, according to circumstances ? 
A review of important facts. — We have seen that the 
muscular and nervous systems are partners in the great 
work of adapting us to our surroundings. They are con- 
stantly saving'‘our lives or sacrificing them; for life itself 
is just a matter of give-and-take between body and en- 
vironment. We have observed how the nervous system 
does its duty by: 
1. Transmitting “ messages.” 
2. Coordinating and unifying all parts of the body. 
3. Storing experience and keeping it on record for daily 
use. It is the nervous system which enables us so to act 
that each to-morrow “finds us farther than to-day.” 
There is no such daily progress in the life of a sponge. 
Further, we found that experience, mind, consists largely 
of “ pictures’ of the environment. By preserving these 
subjective pictures and putting them in place of the ob- 
jective things they stand for, we are enabled to act on 
things absent as though they were present, and on things- 
54
-P-A-G-E-55
  MIND, NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND BEHAVIOR 55 
to-come as though they were already here. So the better- 
brained man “ foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; 
but the simple pass on, and are punished.” 
The next object. — What you want to find now is, how 
the adaptive systems do the adapting, how mind and muscle 
work together to keep you afloat on the energy waves by 
which you are surrounded. These waves, you recall, are 
constantly beating in on you in the form of bumps and 
vibrations, stimuli. To some of these stimuli, the neuro- 
muscular mechanism reacts without your knowing it, as 
when a bright light makes the pupil of the eye grow smaller. 
In other cases, your thoughts and feelings, that is, you, 
are the conscious link that connects stimulus and reaction. 
This gives the two kinds of control, automatic and conscious, 
previously noticed. Now, why should some of your be- 
havior be like protruding peaks, constantly lighted up by 
the glow of consciousness, while so much of it is left sub- 
merged? What behavior must or‘should be conscious, 
what automatic? And what difference do these facts 
make to the teacher? You can best answer these ques- 
tions by looking again at the mechanism of adaptation — 
especially the nervous machine. 
It is interesting to note that man can build machines 
that show wonderful power of adaptation, being self- 
oiling, etc. One scientist has even constructed an “ electric 
dog ” that follows a light to right or left, according to the 
varying position of the light. As a certain physiologist 
remarks: “ If we could build an automobile which, know- 
ing when it needed gasoline, would steer itself round to 
the garage and take in a supply, we should have something 
like human adaptation.”

Improvements over the jellyfish.— Nature has in- 
vented many improvements since she made the jellyfish. 
The awkwardness of getting along without a brain, we have 
already noted. And we have seen that if an animal is to 
fit its ways to its environment, it must have sense organs, 
receivers, receptors, delicate enough to catch all-important 
news from that environment. 
But further, we must have every sensitive spot, such as the 
eye or the ear, connected with every muscle. Suppose that, as 
you start across the street, you hear something like the 
toot of an automobile. The thrill of that toot goes to 
your centers of hearing, located not far inside the brain from 
the ear. But if this center were not connected with the 
muscles of the neck or body, you could not aim your eyes 
in the direction of the sound to see whether you were in 
danger. Further, even if you did so use your eyes and 
saw danger close at hand, it would avail you nothing un- 
less your sight centers were connected with your running 
muscles. If you are yourself driving a car, you must be 
able to call into commission also your arms and hands. 
The touches of the brake lever and other levers on feet 
and hands must in turn start nerve impulses that reach 
many widely-scattered muscles. A little reflection of this 
kind is sufficient to convince you that every sensory point 
of the body must be connected with every motor point. 
Now, the jellyfish has its sensory and motor points con- 
nected in a rough, rambling way; but there is no close, 
1 The term receptor is coming into common use. It is a little broader 
than sense organ, for various reasons, one being that the sense organ is sup- 
posed to report to consciousness, while the receptor may receive stimuli 
without our knowing it.

direct, immediate connection. This switchboard con- 
nection nature secures for us by means of (1) neurones, 
(2) synapses, and (3) nervous levels. We must study 
these new features. 
Neurones. — A neurone (from the Greek neuron, nerve) 
is a nerve cell, including its branches. A glance at the

dendron, a tree), and an axone (a) (from the Greek axon, 
axis). The axone is a bundle of fine nerve fibers. When

it is inclosed in its usual white covering, the medulla, it 
forms what is known as a “ nerve,”’ commonly much the 
longest part of the neurone, and much branched. Neurones 
vary much in size and shape to fit different purposes. 
Some are less than a twentieth of an inch in length, others 
several feet. 
Our nervous system is made of neurones. The spinal 
cord is a rope of them, about the size of an ordinary lead 
pencil; the brain is‘a clump of them. The spinal cord 
looks white because the white, medullated nerves are out- 
side; the gray cell bodies are within. But in the brain, 
the gray cell bodies! are outside, the white nerves within. 
In the whole nervous system, there are probably thou- 
sands of millions of neurones—no one knows just how 
many. Thorndike says that “ even if we knew the exact 
arrangement of each neurone in a man’s brain it would 
take a model as large as St. Paul’s Cathedral to make them 
visible to the naked eye, a model with whose details only 
years of study would familiarize us.” ? Ebbinghaus sug- 
gests that “a man’s life devoted to nothing but counting 
them would be too short to accomplish this task.” * 
Nerve currents. — A current, or impulse, passes from 
end to end of a neurone, much as an electric current passes 
over a wire, but very slowly as compared with nature’s 
more rapid messengers. If it were one hundred feet from 
hand to brain, then a pin prick in the hand would be ex- 
1 Gray matter is not the seat of intellectual ability, as was formerly sup- 
posed. ‘The cell bodies do not contain ideas, but appear to serve chiefly, 
if not wholly, as the stomach of the neurone, that is, they nourish it.

perienced about one second after it had objectively oc- 
curred; and within the brain, where our thinking goes on, 
impulses travel not more than one tenth as fast as they 
do in the nerves outside. In the same length of time (one 
second), sound travels 1100 feet, and light or electricity 
would course seven or eight times round the world. 
Mosso humorously suggests that if the Statue of Liberty 
were miraculously brought to life, she would make a very 
slow American, too slow to serve as guardian of the port 
of New York. She is 138 feet in height. If, then, any 
one touched her foot, he would have to wait about four 
seconds before she would give any sign of sensation and 
begin to move.! 
To secure ideal nicety of connection, these nerve im- 
pulses must be carried over three courses: (1) from re- 
ceptor to central office, that is, to the ‘‘ central nervous 
system,” composed of brain and spinal cord; (2) from 
point to point within the central nervous system, making 
connections as the telephone operator does at “ central”; 
(3) from central out to the muscle or muscles that are to 
act. There are neurones for each purpose: (1) sensory, 
or afferent (ad, to + fero, carry) neurones, (2) connecting 
neurones (sometimes called association neurones), and 
(3) efferent (ex + fero) neurones. When you “ see a pin 
and pick it up,” an impulse (1) follows the afferent neurone 
from the eye to the back lobe of the brain, (2) from the 
back lobe to the front lobe of the brain, and (3) from the 
front lobe to the picking-up muscles. Currents are running, 
somewhere in the neurones, whenever you think, or feel, 
or perform any act. 
1A. Mosso, Fatigue (English ed. of 1904), p. 75.
-P-A-G-E-60
  60 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
If these currents are interfered with, you are undone. 
If the afferent currents from eyes to brain are broken, you 
cease to see. If certain connecting currents are stopped, 
you may see old, familiar words on the page, but be totally 
unable to find any meaning in them. The South American 
Indian tips his arrows with curare, a poison which cuts 
off the efferent currents and so prevents the wounded 
animal from moving. This poison kills, as does that of 
infantile paralysis, by interfering with the breathing center. 
Motor currents no longer reach the breathing muscles, 
and death results from suffocation. 
So far as the neurones are concerned, the nervous im- 
pulse might run at random all over the system. In fact, 
it would; for as water flows from a high-pressure to a low- 
pressure pipe, as heat spreads to cool places, as electricity 
flows from high to low “ potential,” so a nerve current runs 
where resistance is least. In the jellyfish, the nerve current 
does spread in this wandering way. It is the synapses 
that save us from being like the jellyfish in this respect. 
The synapses. — Synapsis means “a fitting together.” 
A synapsis is a point where neurones come close enough 
together to permit a current to pass. So far as we can 
find, the fibers do not touch, but are separated so slightly 
that a current can jump across from one neurone to the 
next, provided it is going in the right direction, the sensory- 
to-motor direction. (See Fig. 13.) No current ever flows 
backward, from efferent to afferent: the synapsis forbids 
it. If the current could be so reversed, then it is quite 
possible that if we, blindfold, picked up a pin, our visual 
centers would be so stimulated that we should have the 
experience of seeing a pin; going through the motions of 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  MIND, NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND BEHAVIOR 61 
making music would cause us to hear music, etc. The 
subjective and objective worlds would be hopelessly mixed. 
But further, some synapses are harder to pass than others. 
Much of this goes back to birth and before: it is hard by 
inheritance to do some things, irresistibly 
easy to do others. But throughout life, 
repetition reduces resistance, and more or 
less as more or less energy passes through 
the synapses. What you do most often 
and most vigorously, you will do again 
most easily. So, partly by nature, partly 
by nurture, we come to possess a nervous 
system that is a perfect labyrinth of 
graded resistances and preferred paths. 
We can get some idea of what our con- 
dition would be if these graded resist- 
ances were broken down, by breaking 
them down with strychnine in the frog. 
Even to mild stimuli, it reacts with a 
convulsion that seems to involve every 
muscle of its body. There are no longer 
any preferred paths: all are wide open.

Levels of the nervous system. — Throughout the ages 
that lie between primitive jellyfish and present man, the 
nervous system has been evolving by stories. The strug- 
gling animal soul has ever built itself more stately mansions 
of neurones, leaving its low-vaulted past and advancing 
to vaster domes, arches, and loops of nerve fiber. 
Three levels have been distinguished. The low, or 
spinal level, developed before animals had eyes or ears, 
or anything more than a little knob of nerve cells to serve 
as a brain. The earthworm offers a familiar example of 
such a system. 
The second level, the mid-level, is marked by the ap- 
pearance of special sense organs in the head, and a real 
brain. The dog has such a two-story system. Compare 
his experience and coérdination of movement with those 
of the earthworm. The higher we go in the nervous sys- 
tem, the greater the responsibility and authority, each 
higher center stimulating and controlling a number of 
lower centers, and through them, their many muscles. 
But while such a two-level system may gather and store 
experience, it does little either in the way of analyzing it, 
or building up new and original ideas. 
Man (and, to some extent, the ape) has a three-level 
nervous system, characterized by great increase in the size 
of the cerebrum, the front and upper part of the brain. 
Of course, nervous systems are not separated into levels

as indicated, but need not always do so.

by sharp dividing lines, as houses are divided into stories. 
There is no way of knowing, as yet, exactly where mid- 
level leaves off and high-level begins, as systems become 
gradually more complex. Some would call the nervous 
system of the dog a three-level system. But for our 
practical purpose, the ability to think seems to be a good 
test of the presence of the highest level. 
Man’s brain has more and longer connecting neurones 
than any other, great loops and arches of them built above 
the second level. Here lies the secret of his imagination, 
his seeking out of witty inventions, and his minutely 
adapted behavior. A single idea, lodged in these high- 
level neurones, may control all lower centers, and so all 
behavior, for years, or for life. The ideal of youth is 
realized in maturity. 
Where is consciousness? — We have already found 
that mind dwells in the brain. Just why it should not have 
its home in the synapses of the spinal cord also, or exactly 
what happens in the neurones when consciousness takes 
place, we do not know. But, as James says, conscious- 
ness deserts all processes where it is no longer of use. To 
look at the same truth from the other side, consciousness 
goes where it is of most use; and that is where new adapta- 
tions are being worked out. The mind behaves like a 
good general, who leaves the lesser routine affairs to be 
discharged by subordinates in forms fixed by long practice, 
while he devotes himself to the perilous new which must be 
met by an ever varying plan of campaign. 
In view of this, we should not expect the spinal cord to 
be conscious, for its duty consists in running off old acts 
of behavior mechanically, not in devising new acts variably.
-P-A-G-E-65
MIND, NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND BEHAVIOR 65 
It is the business of consciousness to make new adjust- 
ments, but the lower nerve centers have no such adjust- 
ments to make. 
It is even thinkable that, if all seasons were alike and 
all environment changeless, mind as we now know it would 
die out. 
It is the old man, whose failing nervous system has 
dimmed and subdued his mental powers somewhat, who 
becomes the extreme conservative, who is satisfied to “let 
well enough alone,” and who wishes nothing better than to 
see things preserved “just as they used to be.” 
Monotony kills consciousness. We do not sense the 
pressure of the air, fourteen pounds per square inch of 
our skins, because we are “used to it.” The Esquimau,

living in constant cold, the African in constant heat, have 
accomplished less than those from whom nature has de- 
manded more variety of adaptation. Consider the longing 
of the growing child mind for perceptual variety. As 
adults, many must still depend on this dance of perceptions 
to keep them “alive”; others, a more limited number, 
find their variety by working out new thought-com- 
binations. 
Levels of behavior. — Figure 15 will help to systematize 
much of what has gone before. 
The circle represents the brain; and the portion below 
the circle, the spinal cord (including the medulla oblongata). 
Obviously, there are no such sharp dividing lines in the 
nervous system. Following are examples of the various 
kinds of behavior mentioned : 
High level: Thoughtfully investing money. 
Mid-level: Acquired (Habit) : Habitual gum chewing or 
candy eating. 
Inherited (Instinct) : Fighting because angry. 
Low-level: Acquired: Running bicycle pedals after long 
: practice. 
Inherited: Beating of heart. 
How nerve impulses influence each other. — Nerve im- 
pulses, like interflowing streams of water, may help or 
hinder each other. The helping is called facilitation; and 
the hindering, inhibition. 
Facilitation may take place as you sit reading, if some 
one behind you tickles your cheek. The first tickle may 
bring no response; but the nervous impulse aroused seems 
to make the neurone more sensitive to succeeding stimuli.
-P-A-G-E-67
  MIND, NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND BEHAVIOR 67 
‘ ? As the tickling continues, there is a ‘‘ summation,” reén- 
forcement, combining of stimuli. The result may be action, 
perhaps conscious action, though any of the tickles, taken 
alone, would not have produced it. Stimuli may facilitate 
each other under a variety of conditions. In case of the 
mosquito in church, the two stimuli, the drilling into your 
hand, and the sight of the little insect robber, are likely 
to facilitate each other, hasten your reaction, and make it 
more energetic. Or a young man, about to carry the ball 
forward in a football rush, may find his nerve currents 
facilitated by a glimpse of a friend, followed by the cheers 
of the crowd. 
Inhibition is illustrated by the case of a swimmer whose 
cramps inhibit his swimming. Here, consciousness does 
not control; but our lives are full of experiences where it 
does. 
Both facilitation and inhibition may be studied by intro- 
spection. Many times a day one idea is knocked out, in- 
hibited, prevented from expressing itself, by an opposing 
idea. You think of doing something bold, bad, rash, 
but your incipient wickedness is quickly strangled by the 
succeeding thought of what “they” would say, or of 
your mother, or of God. 
What meaning has all this for education ? — Much every 
way. To educate a child is to make such paths and set 
up such currents in his nervous system that he will react 
more successfully and adapt himself better to the world 
1 Some like to have an inhibitory reminder, such as a ring, a photograph, 
or a crucifix always about. To many, God is the Great Inhibitor. Milton 
lived as ever in his Great Taskmaster’s eye. The Ten Commandments 
are a table of nots, inhibitions,
-P-A-G-E-68
  68 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
he lives in. Now, we find some nervous paths fixed at 
birth, beyond our changing; and many others are fixed 
all but the finishing touches. There is no highway de- 
partment that can plan and put through thoroughfares 
at pleasure in the brain of a child. But often there are 
rival paths with equal reénforcement. Here the teacher 
holds the balance of power between good and bad. 
And further, luckily for us, the supreme level of the 
nervous system is the most plastic part. Each upper 
nerve center controls many lower ones. The teacher’s 
responsibility for enthroning ideals in these higher neurones 
should make him purify himself for his pupil’s sake. For 
every item of experience does its bit in building this maze 
of graded resistances and preferred paths. Whatever goes 
in as consciousness comes out, some time, as behavior. 
No one, pupil or teacher, can eat an olive or utter a prayer 
and be quite the same afterward as before. In one sense, 
your pupil will be the sum of the experience you give him 
and the behavior you put him through. His nervous sys- 
tem, as you form and build it, will be a minute map of his 
character. An omnipotent physiologist could probably 
examine his neurones and from them read off the record 
of his past and predict much of his future. ‘See the 
world?” says Henry van Dyke. “ Yes, see the world; 
but remember that you become most like what you look 
at longest.”

performance of a simple act, we pass from full consciousness of it 
to partial consciousness, and so toward automatic performance.

Introspection of interesting points may be given. 
The instructor may use other figures. 
2. A study of inhibition. 
Play a variation of the game, ‘‘ My aunt has arrived from India,” 
in which each must pretend to use, and keep using, whatever his aunt

pair of slippers ” (feet are kept patting the floor). “A fan” (left 
hand kept waving). “A music box” (right hand turns crank). 
“A pair of glasses ” (eyes wink regularly). Etc. 
Introspection and study of how movements tend to interfere with, 
that is, inhibit, each other.

Exercises. —1. Predict what each of the following words will 
make some friend of yours think of first ; then try them on him, ask- 
ing him to react by pronouncing the first word that enters his mind 
after you give the signal word. Bread. Boy. Day. Good. High. 
Humpty. Fast. True. Easy. Rich. Explain the results. 
Do the same with these: Money. Note. Red. New York. 
Vote. Potato. Fox. Fish. Picture. Memory. 
Did you succeed as well with the latter list? Explain further. 
2. Turn to the discussion of attention in some other textbook 
and substitute the word consciousness for attention wherever the latter 
appears. Do the statements still make sense? How do you ex- 
plain the result ? 
Problem of this chapter. — Let us recall that the nervous 
system is the chief adaptive system, the great controller 
of what we do. Its lowest level has no consciousness, and 
controls fixed behavior only; in its upper levels run the 
currents of our thoughts and feelings, and also the nervous 
impulses which set off all our behavior that is not me- 
chanical. Although there are those who deny that a 
thought can cause an act, we naturally believe that the 
consciousness sets off the conduct — is the conductor, so 
to speak. “ To-morrow,” I think, “I will buy my new 
hat.” The day comes. I buy the hat. And I should 
certainly not have bought it had not the thought preceded. 
Now, if it is true that consciousness controls conduct, it 
is a very important truth for us teachers; for that which 
stands first in consciousness, which “ gets our attention ” 
72
-P-A-G-E-73
    
NERVOUS CHANNELS AND MENTAL CURRENTS 73 
by its attractiveness or “‘ gets on our nerves ” by its odious- 
ness, is likely to stand foremost in conduct. The fisher- 
man finds that he can induce a fish to bite, even when it 
is not hungry, if he can dangle his bait before its eyes for a 
time. Let anything hold your attention for a protracted 
period, and it is almost impossible for you to do otherwise 
than act on it. As our thoughts and feelings follow each 
other and form connections, so our various acts are likely 
to get connected. Further, it is reasonable to suppose 
that corresponding connections are made among the 
synapses. 
To know how to educate a child is to know how to put 
him through such experiences as will wear proper paths 
in his nervous system. Our problem, then, is to learn 
what controls the wearing of paths and the forming of con- 
nections. How can we make a hatchet suggest truth- 
telling, even more strongly than it does the cutting down 
of cherry trees? 
We can discuss this penile more understandingly if 
we first glance at the structure of the brain and its way of 
working. 
The brain. — The medulla oblongata (literally, oblong 
marrow), commonly called the medulla, or bulb, is the 
enlarged upper portion of the spinal cord, seen in the 
figure (Fig. 17) just back of the ear. It is not a seat of 
consciousness, but contains important automatic centers, 
such as those for breathing, heart-beat, swallowing, and 
regulating the movements of the stomach. The cerebellum 
(literally, little brain) likewise is not a center of conscious- 
ness, but an automatic center. It is thought to be a 
regulator of muscular movement.  
-P-A-G-E-74
  
  74 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
The part of the brain in which we are most interested 
is the cerebrum, an organ so large that it fills nearly the 
whole of the upper part of the skull. The figure (Fig. 17) 
shows the left half. The right half, which is similar (as 
the right hand is to the left), is partially separated from its

mate by a deep fissure which runs from forehead to back- 
head. But a band composed of a multitude of fibers con- 
nects the two halves, and as each center (except one) on 
the left side has a corresponding center on the right, the 
two hemispheres, as they are called, work, for the most 
part, as a single organ. However, each half is connected
-P-A-G-E-75
NERVOUS CHANNELS AND MENTAL CURRENTS 75 
with the opposite half of the body. Should convulsive 
twitchings in the right arm indicate brain lesion, the 
surgeon would remove a button of bone so as to uncover 
the center marked “ arm,” in the left frontal lobe. 
For convenience in referring to the brain, it is divided, 
in a rough way, into lobes. The upper front quarter of 
each hemisphere is the frontal lobe; the upper back 
quarter, the parietal lobe; the lower front quarter is the 
temporal lobe; the lower back quarter, the occipital lobe. 
‘With the exception of the fissure of Sylvius and the fissure 
of Rolando, there are no definite boundary lines in common 
use. 
The work of the brain. — As we have learned, the brain 
is a great central office for the business of the nervous 
system ; and it does its work in a businesslike way, having 
“a place for everything and everything in its place,” a 
special department for each separate function. As we 
should expect, it has (1) receiving stations (sensory, 
afferent), (2) connecting fibers (often called association 
fibers), and (3) sending stations (motor, efferent). 
The receiving stations are connected with the sense 
organs. The receiving station for the eye is in the occipital 
lobe; that for the ear, in the temporal lobe; and those for 
the skin and muscles, in the post-central convolution (see 
Fig. 17). The chief stations for sending messages to the 
muscles are in the pre-central convolution. The con- 
necting fibers between stations are especially abundant in 
man’s brain. As compared with the brain of a lower 
animal, these are what give it such great bulk, and con- 
stitute its chief point of difference. 
If a center is injured, its work is interfered with. If
-P-A-G-E-76
76 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
the center for sight is destroyed, we not only can not see, 
but can not even remember or imagine how things look. 
It seems safe to say, then, that whenever we are seeing, 
or picturing things seen, a nervous impulse is exciting the 
visual center. Laura Bridgman became blind and deaf 
when less than two years old. When her brain was ex- 
amined after death, it was found that the centers for 
sight and hearing were underdeveloped, and contained a 
large number of undeveloped nerve cells. 
As the mind passes from point to point, from moonlight © 
to music, and thence to the cool swish of the water against 
the hand that overhangs the boat, or to the movements 
of the dance, the neurones in center after center are start- 
ing their mysterious processes all about the brain. If we 
could watch these conscious currents as they play hithet 
and thither about the cerebrum, it would probably remind 
us of a restless fire whose flames flash and die and burn 
again from point to point incessantly. And the stronger 
and livelier the consciousness, the stronger and livelier 
the brain currents. 
The problem of preferred paths. — Perhaps it would be 
more appropriate to speak of “ wires” than of “ paths ”’; 
for the nervous impulse runs along fibers which, for the 
most part, are insulated somewhat as electric wires 
are. 
We have found that the brain is a perfect web of neurones. 
If we could map the preferred paths through this maze — 
of fibers, it would make a map much more complex than 
any we have ever seen of a railroad or a telephone system. |

and to-morrow, to buy some luxury? On the answer hang 
all teaching and learning. Hereby do we explain all skill 
of hand, all cleverness of mind. If there is any one most 
important thing for teachers to know, it is just what follows 
now.

connections are:

Intensity of current.

We shall study these in order. 
| Brain set. — Brains all have, in general, about the same 
parts; but as flowers so often seem to specialize in pro- 
ducing a fine calyx, pistil, or corolla, their other parts 
being small or ill-formed, so the average brain fairly blooms 
out in certain centers, but is weak, perhaps blasted, in 
others. Every student can pick out born “ fiends” for 
mathematics, science, language — and also born failures. 
One can sing, or play the piano well at five years of age; 
another can never mount the scale. If we could see all 
our brains thrown up in relief according to the inborn 
efficiency of their different centers, we should find them as 
varied as landscapes or faces are. 
And further, this hereditary brain set is likely to be 
reénforced by years of experience. Your mathematics 
fiend is likely to practice mathematics by teaching or 
otherwise. In time, his brain becomes so sensitive to the 
subject that it has permanent right of way there: new
-P-A-G-E-78
78 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
problems open new brain paths and are solved with marvel- 
ous ease. 
By brain set, then, we mean an arrangement of neurones 
favorable to the forming of nervous and mental con- 
nections of a certain kind, an arrangement which is inborn, 
but modified (helped or hindered) by practice, by ex- 
perience. 
VY Mental set. — Brain set is long-lived and not conscious 
necessarily: it is a matter of arrangement of nervous 
machinery, and so is present in a sleeping brain, or even 
in a dead one. Mental set is shorter-lived, and requires 
consciousness. It is a temporary throwing open of the 
channels to a certain kind of thought or behavior, much as 
one may turn a number of railroad switches. You come 
from a French recitation into the psychology class and are 
at once asked a question. You know the answer but can 
not summon it immediately because your mind is “ set ” 
for French. Students who have passed from one foreign- 
language class to another have been known to reply in 
the wrong language. 
Mental set can often be induced by suggestion and cir- 
cumstance. A certain ticket seller states that when he is 
in his office, he can give immediately all details concerning 
the trains that pass through his station, but is quite unable 
to do so at home. Home starts a different mental set. 
At a Hallowe’en party, our minds are set by decorations 
and darkness for the seeing of ghosts. Talk of music for 
five minutes and the word “ note ”’ will call up one thing; 
talk of banking, or of classroom lectures, and it will sug- 
gest something quite different. The skillful teacher “ pre- 
pares ” the pupil’s mind at the opening of a lesson by many
-P-A-G-E-79
  NERVOUS CHANNELS AND MENTAL CURRENTS 719 
suggestions or questions that will induce a favorable set 
of mind. 
Much depends, in every human situation, on inciting 
the right mental set. It makes a great difference whether 
we ask the people to prepare for war or prepare against war. 
Dorothy Leonard’s poem, “‘ Two Views,” published some 
time ago in the New York Times, shows how each sees 
what his mental set (and perhaps brain set) causes him 
to see. 
Oh, what do you find in my little green garden? 
What did you find in my garden so gay? 
_“ Rosebugs and slugs and fat caterpillars, 
Little green worms and the rose-leaves half eaten, 
Mildew and blight and a smell of decay.” 
Oh, what did you see in my poor little garden? 
What did you see in my garden so dreary? 
“T saw a bird like a jewel go flashing, 
Peonies blowing and purple flags flowing, 
Saw the sun set, heard the harp of the veery.” 
Mental set, then, is a conscious, temporary tendency to 
open brain paths of a certain kind. It is probably ac- 
companied by the charging of certain parts of the brain 
with more than the usual amount of nerve energy. 
) Intensity. — The wearing of brain paths is suggestive 
of the wearing of water ways. Where water goes depends 
on the “lay of the land.” Where a brain current runs 
depends on the set of the brain. Further, if a deluge sends 
a flood current of water through a given channel, it is 
likely to be so deeply fixed that it will hold its own against 
all rivals for a long time. So, if a strong stimulus sends an
-P-A-G-E-80
  80 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
intense impulse over a chain of neurones, the resulting 
channel may remain fixed for life. 
Throw out the word “ fire” to start associations in a 
group of people, and somebody usually thinks of a fire 
which, years ago, gave him an intense experience. The 
brain path is so fixed that he tells you he “ can never for- 
get.” So the naturalist who ran into the cactus bush 
never forgot his lesson. It is for intensity that we use 
emphasis in speaking, underscoring in writing, italics in 
print, red chalk for misspelled words, etc. It is largely 
for intensity that we use objects and apparatus in school. 
Objects start stronger nerve currents, usually, than do 
words or ideas. 
Frequency. — Repetitio mater studiorum, “ Repetition is 
e mother of learning,’ was long the teacher’s motto. 
Resistance at the synapses seems to be reduced in pro- 
portion to the amount of nervous energy that passes 
through. As most of our nervous currents are of moderate 
intensity, we must depend on abundant repetition to fix 
many of our brain paths. ‘“ Practice makes perfect.” 
So “ bread and butter,” “ boy and girl,” ‘‘ day and night,” 
are so often repeated that one member of a pair almost 
invariably calls up the other. 
5 Recency. — Brain channels seem, like water channels, 
to become clogged if unused. And besides, new paths 
sometimes tend to obliterate old ones. In this respect, 
the brain is like a blackboard many times written over 
without erasing. Other things being equal, the most 
recent writing stands out. So, musician and orator want 
a recent rehearsal, no matter how old the performance; 
the student reviews his lesson on the way to class; the 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
NERVOUS CHANNELS AND MENTAL CURRENTS 81 
teacher is astonished at the meager results on examination 
day if he has not held a recent review. 
These five laws, brain set, mental set, intensity, fre- 
quency, recency, are the five fingers that make strong the 
teacher’s grasp on his pupil’s mind and behavior. Some 
psychologists would add the law of primacy also: the first 
time anything is experienced, the nerve cells are fresh 
and impressionable and pleasure or displeasure often in- 
tense. But intensity is included in the laws already given. 
Judge for yourself whether primacy is sufficiently important 
to be made a sixth law. 
We shall find that these laws apply to every mental 
process, be it memory, thought, or emotion, and to the 
learning of every skillful act, such as writing. How can 
it be otherwise, since all experience and behavior depend 
on nervous paths, and these are the laws by which nervous 
paths are formed? 
y Attention. — As attention is supposed to determine what 
stands out in our minds, and so what gets itself expressed 
in our behavior, it must be closely related to the five laws 
just discussed. 
The word “ attention’ is much misused, and does not 
mean any one thing consistently and all the time. We 
often speak of it as if it were a kind of mysterious force- 
in-itself, capable of doing what it pleases; but it is not. 
You probably feel that you can pay attention to what you 
please. And so, in a sense, you can. Yet you are just as 
much subject to stimuli, including brain currents, which 
themselves stimulate other centers, as an automobile is 
to its steering wheel. But it may take years to convince 
you of this.   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  
  82 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Attention is simply direction and force of consciousness. 
We shall probably get a truthful picture of the facts 
if we think of an interplay of neuro-mental currents (that 
is, nervous currents accompanied by consciousness) some- 
what like the interplay of a number of streams of water of 
varying size and force. Currents from some stimuli are 
inhibited: they are too weak to make much difference with 
the general direction of the stream. You pay little heed 
to the piano in the distance if your mind is flowing, full 
force, toward your lesson. The soldier in battle often does 
not know he is wounded and bleeding, till the charge is 
over, or he grows faint. Here we can see why a great 
and good purpose is the best inhibitor of all stimuli to 
do evil. 
As a stream flows with stronger current at the center and 
more lazily along the sides, so consciousness has an in- 
tense “center” and weaker side currents. One object, per- 
haps your friend as he approaches, is central in conscious- 
ness, takes your attention, while the whole expanse of 
landscape about him comes but dimly to mind. The 
“field” of attention (to use a different figure) is often 
likened to the field of vision: make any one object promi- 
nent and clear, and all others recede and grow dim, some 
to the point of disappearance. 
Kinds of attention. — Many names have been invented 
for different kinds of attention distinguished by various 
psychologists; but we shall probably keep closest to the 
truth of the matter if we recognize but two main kinds, 
naive and reflective. 
Naive means natural, childishly natural, natural in the 
sense of untaught, undisciplined, unorganized, unreflective.

NERVOUS CHANNELS AND MENTAL CURRENTS 83 
We can see this naive attention (flow of consciousness) at 
its purest in the lower animals and young children, for they 
are capable of no other kind. In such cases, the high- 
level nervous centers are either not present or not active, 
and consciousness is likely to flit from object to object as 
one lower center after another is stimulated by the outside 
world. The playing child gives us the typical picture as 
he attends successively to the bark of the dog, the flitting 
of the butterfly, the smell of a flower, the tickle of the fly 
crossing his hand. But, as the child’s mind wanders from 
perception to perception, so the adult attention may go 
haphazard from idea to idea, as every daydream shows. 
Naive attention is, for the most part, thoughtless attention, 
attention not guided by any clear purpose. Its interest 
does not, as a rule, reach beyond the passing moment. 
Rival perceptions or ideas often give rise to curious 
mental conflicts. When you find a friend undergoing such : 
a conflict, it is amusing (if no harm can result) to start 
“currents ” on one side or the other by offering suggestions. 
Children can be induced to reverse themselves two or three 
times in succession. It is a part of the art of salesmanship 
to watch the customer and really decide for him which of 
two articles he will take, by deftly retiring one of them 
and “ talking up ” the other. 
Reflective attention, on the other hand, is guided by 
clear purpose; and it is usually long-span attention, de- 
termined by something far in the future. A good example 
of it is the student who, though lured by theater, dance, 
and the gay life generally, keeps his mind on graduation 
years ahead and faithfully turns to and does his daily 
task. And whereas naive attention follows a feeling of
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
some kind, reflective attention, like high-level behavior, 
is ‘‘ guided by thought.” 
Here also, as we find so often in psychology when we 
try to make sharp distinctions, we can fix no very definite 
dividing line. When a horse works his halter off and finds 
his way to the feed box, or a dog watches unweariedly at 
a woodchuck hole for hours, there.seems to be long-span 
effort for an object which may stand out fairly clear in the 
animal’s mind. 
In our own lives and in the lives of our pupils, the struggle 
is ever to replace naive with reflective attention. In lower 
grades, we try to make every exercise so attractive that 
there is no temptation for naive attention to wander; 
but in the higher grades, we should train the pupil’s 
mind to stick to the bitter end, no matter how bitter it 
may be. 
In time, reflective attention comes to need a thoughtful 
start only, after which it runs on as a habit for a con- 
siderable stretch. 
High and low consciousness. — Since attention includes 
both direction and force of consciousness, one further factor 
must be considered: the mental stream may be high or low. 
When you are in fine fettle mentally and feel equal to 
any task, consciousness and nervous energy are abundant, 
and you can easily “ pay attention,” that is, give lively 
consciousness, to almost anything. But when sleep weighs 
heavily on you, the stream of consciousness is reduced to 
a vagrant trickle. Lessons remain irresistibly hard, how- 
ever often repeated. Everything gets hazy. All is vanity 
save the enticing bed. You feel that you are not “all 
there ” — and you are right. Attention is low.
-P-A-G-E-85
NERVOUS CHANNELS AND MENTAL CURRENTS 85 
To be strictly accurate, then, we should speak, not 
merely of naive and reflective attention, but of low or high 
naive attention and low or high reflective attention. 
Diffused and concentrated attention. — The amount of 
mental energy we can exert at any time is limited, like the 
amount of physical energy. We may expend it all on a 
single object, or scatter it on many. Which we do should 
depend on our purpose. If we want water to irrigate a 
wide expanse, we spread it out thin; but to turn mill 
wheels we concentrate it in one powerful stream. The 
teacher, standing before a class, must often give diffused 
attention to the whole room; the student, alone with his 
lesson, should concentrate. 
In life at large, the diffusion policy irrigates the mind 
into variety and luxuriance of ideas, interesting as an un- 
explored jungle. Such diffusion is permissible in youth, 
when one may well be a jack of all things until the mind 
comes to itself; but the majority of men feel, as they 
mature, that the age requires of them the concentration 
of the specialist. The most common demand is for high, 
concentrated, reflective attention. 
You have now taken a first general view of all that you 
will find in psychology, much as you take a first general 
view of a school before cultivating the acquaintance of 
the individual classrooms. In Part Two, we shall study 
such details of mind as are most necessary for the teacher 
to know.

The purpose of the exercise is to get some indication as to which 
laws control most of our everyday associations. 
Let the instructor pronounce the following hundred words! to the

nounced, the student will write it, and following, whatever the word 
first suggests to him.

Let each go through his list and indicate, as best he can, to what 
each association was due, whether brain set, mental set, intensity, 
frequency, or recency. B may be used for brain set, M for mental 
set,andsoon. Cross out all cases where there is serious doubt as to 
explanation.

Exercise 2 below? 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Practice drawing Fig. 17 until you can make from memory 
a fair outline sketch of the brain, showing its principal features. 
2. Ask some one to write rapidly the first hundred words he can

occupation, chief interests, and so forth. 
3. “T’ll make you remember this!” What law do we probably 
expect to make use of when we threaten thus? 
4. A boy, blind from birth, knew a cat by touch. On receiving 
his sight, he could not recognize the cat without touching her. At 
length he picked her up, stroked her, and at the same time looked 
at her intently, saying, ‘‘ Now, puss, I shall know you next time.” 
Explain in terms of connecting currents. 
5. ‘Why does money in pocket lead us to-day to give to charity 
and to-morrow to buy some luxury? ”

etc. 
7. If brain set is so strongly fixed by heredity, what influence 
should this have on school work ? 
8. A good canvasser rarely cares to sell more than one line of 
goods. Why is this? Do people buy chiefly what they want, or

WHAT THE MIND IS MADE OF 
Exercises. — 1. (a) Select any object, such as a book, an apple, ora 
pencil. Make a list of the items of knowledge of this object con- 
tributed by each sense organ. What “ news” of it is furnished by 
the eye, the ear, skin, muscles, etc. ? 
(b) If you take away, one by one, all these items of news, what is 
left of your perception of the object? Suppose you had never seen, 
heard, etc.: what difference would it have made with your experience 
of this object? What difference would it have made with your mind 
as a whole? 
(c) Of what are perceptions made? 
2. Review pages 49-51. 
Mind is made of experience. But of what is experience 
made? We have seen that the brain: 
1. Gathers experience. 
2. Records and reproduces experience. 
3. Analyzes experience. 
4. Synthesizes experience. 
5. Expresses experience in conduct. 
The great bulk of our experience is gathered in the form 
of perceptions and reproduced in the form of ideas. In 
this chapter, we shall analyze a few samples of experience, 
and study their parts. 
The analysis of mind. — Analysis means “ taking apart,” 
especially, separating anything into its elements. Ele- 
ments are simplest parts. 
or
-P-A-G-E-92
  g2 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
In everyday life, you seldom analyze things: you use 
them — salt on potatoes, water to drink. But if you want 
thoroughly to understand salt or water, you analyze it. 
The result is often surprising: water yields two gases, 
hydrogen and oxygen, neither of which seems like the 
liquid you swim in. So, if you hope ever to look under- 
standingly into the soul of your pupil, you must analyze 
mind; and the result is usually surprising — somewhat 
like analyzing a picture into so many dabs of paint: the 
picture is gone. But psychology synthesizes, too: you 
will make more beautiful pictures than those you de- 
stroy. 
‘You cannot pull your consciousness apart as you do a 
flower; for mind is made of processes, not things. To 
analyze it is much like separating the tongues of*flame that 
enwreath each other in a dancing fire. Let us try the 
task. 
Analysis of perception and idea. — You recall that a 
perception is a mental picture of anything as present; an 
idea is a similar picture of anything as absent — or at 
least, not seen, heard, touched, etc. Let us list the simple 
parts of your perception of an orange here in your hand, 
and your idea of one on a distant fruit stand.

  WHAT THE MIND IS MADE OF 93 
There is a striking similarity: the elements seem the same. 
In fact, there is but one difference between this perception 
and this idea: the perception is made of impressions; the 
idea is composed of images. 
An impression is the simplest bit of experience as it comes 
to us by means of a sense organ. Examples are: the color 
red while the eye is fixed on it; the taste of sugar while 
it is on the tongue. 
An image is a revived impression: That is, the brain 
revives the impression as best it can without having the 
sense organ stimulated again. Examples are: red as 
imagined, say with eyes closed ; sweet as experienced with- 
out stimulating the nerve of taste. 
Contrast of perception and idea. — A perception is a 
unified group of impressions — unified because all referring 
to the same object of experience. In Figure 18, A suggests 
   A. Perception. B. Idea. 
Fic. 18. — “Map” of a perception and of an idea. 
a perception, each solid little circle standing for an im- 
pression. In B, the impressions are revived, resurrected 
in a pale, ghost-like form, as images. An idea is a unified 
group of images. 
As impressions are usually more strong and stable than
-P-A-G-E-94
  
  94 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
images, so perceptions are usually more clear, strong, and 
stable than ideas. You would hardly mistake your idea 
of a dollar for the perception of the dollar itself. Yet such 
confusions do occur. In one case, a man, on meeting a 
friend in the street, was even unable to tell whether he 
was speaking to the real individual or to an idea of him, 
until he touched the friend or heard his footsteps. All 
that is necessary to produce such confusion is to excite 
that part of the brain, where these images are recorded, 
as vigorously as it usually is stimulated by the action of 
the sense organs. 
So the lover, in Riley’s An Old Sweetheart of Mine, says: 
“ An old sweetheart of mine! — Is this 
her presence here with me, 
Or but a vain creation of 
a lover’s memory?” 
Images from childhood come back with almost the in- 
tensity they had originally as impressions. The climax 
of the poem is the substitution of a sure-enough perception 
for what turned out to have been a mere idea: 
“ But, ah! my dream is broken 
by a step upon the stair, 
And the door is softly opened, 
and — my wife is standing there: 
Yet with eagerness and rapture 
all my visions I resign, — 
To greet the living presence 
of that old sweetheart of mine.” !

  WHAT THE MIND IS MADE OF 95 
Ideas can vary more than perceptions. — Those who wish 
to see the world, travel all over it in search of new per- 
ceptions. Yet the number of such experiences is limited 
compared with the ideas you can build inside your own 
brain. 
Some ideas are revived perceptions, as was that of the 
orange; but this is not true of all. For while the mind 
can not create new images outright, nevertheless, when 
once we get a goodly stock of them, we can combine 
them, separate, and recombine them, without end. So, 
you can make mental oranges that are red, green, blue, 
purple, black, gray, white — something nature has never 
done. 
It is just here that we so far outstrip the lower animals. 
We have more connecting fibers in our brains; and we 
connect our images more variously to make more new and 
original ideas. 
Sensation. — There is no essential difference between a 
tone as it is sung into a good phonograph, and the ma- 
chine’s reproduction of that tone. So, there is no difference 
in kind, or quality, between an impression, which results 
from the stimulating of a sense organ, and the brain’s 
reproduction of that impression in the form of an image. 
An impression and its image may be likened to a sound 
and its echo: both echo and image are the same as their 
originals, only fainter. 
Now, impressions and images often mingle in complex 
ways, so it becomes convenient to have a word that in- 
cludes both. That word is sensation. A sensation is 
either an impression or an image, just as a sound is either 
an original or an echo.
-P-A-G-E-96
  96 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
The “ feelings.” — Watch your mind as you read this 
stanza: 
“ The day is cold and dark and dreary ; 
It rains, and the wind is never weary ; 
The vine still clings to the moldering wall, 
But at every gust the dead leaves fall, 
And the day is dark and dreary.” 
You get pictures, ideas, of rain, wind, old wall, falling leaves 
— but there is something more, a feeling. 
A feeling is a like or a dislike, pleasure or displeasure in 
something. 
“ Love to chawnk green apples an’ go swimmin’ in the lake — 
Hate to take the castor-ile they give for belly-ache! ” 
Here are the fundamentals of all feeling, the loves and 
the hates, the attractions and repulsions. 
In common speech, “ feeling ” is used to refer to touch. 
Not so in psychology. For example, the psychologist 
never says, “ The desk feels smooth.” It ought to be 
» correct to say, “‘ The desk touches smooth,” just as we 
say, “ The lake looks rough,” or ‘‘ The meat cuts tough.” 
Later (in Chapter XIII), we shall study the various 
kinds of feeling. But just now we are after elements, 
simplest parts. What is there in a feeling that makes it 
different from a perception, or an idea? 
Let your eye rest for a moment on various colors about 
you, one at a time. Select one that you like and one 
that you dislike. This simple bit of like or dislike that 
accompanies a sensation is the element we are seeking for. 
It is called an affection. Beware of the popular meaning 
of the word. An affection is the least bit of like or dislike. 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  WHAT THE MIND IS MADE OF 97 
In other words, it is an element of agreeableness or dis- 
agreeableness in our experience. 
Sensation and affection. — Here, then, is what mind 
is made of, sensations and affections — nothing more. 
From the birth of the babe to the death of the adult, in 
dreaming or waking, from the depths of the sinner’s sorrow 
to the heights of the saintliest joy, back of the fool’s 
babbling and in the wisdom of the wisest, we shall find no 
consciousness so complex that it cannot be reduced and 
resolved into sensations and affections. 
Let us compare the two. Sensation is a mental element 
that is referred to some particular bodily organ. Colors 
come to us by the eye, sounds by the ear. Affection is a 
mental element that is not referred to any special bodily 
organ. The bit of agreeableness or disagreeableness may 
seem to be in the tongue as we taste, in the nose as we smell, 
or nowhere in particular, a sort of feels-good-all-over ex- 
perience, or the opposite. ‘A sight to delight the eyes,” 
we say: yet we know the delight is not in the eye. 
The sensation is definite, results from a definite stimulus 
on a definite sense organ. It is like a tap on a bell at a 
certain point. The affection is indefinite: it resembles 
the spreading thrill that vibrates throughout the whole 
bell. 
Affection can never come alone, but only following a 
sensation. A sensation is the stimulus of every affection: 
you are never glad of nothing, but of something, something 
which comes to you in the form of sensations. 
Finally, serisation is the mental element that stands for 
something other than itself, usually something in the en- 
vironment. We may almost say that our sensations form 
~ 
i ee
-P-A-G-E-98
       98 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
a kind of intermediate, neutral zone between the purely 
objective and the purely subjective. Affection is the 
mental element that has no direct objective reference. 
One laughs, another cries, over the same event: they get 
the same sensations from it, but not the same affections. 
The feeling each has depends very largely on his permanent 
brain set, and on his mental set at the time. 
Properties of sensation and affection —By a property, 
we mean an attribute, trait, characteristic. Grass has 
the property of greenness, and yourself, the property of 
honesty. Now, what properties have sensation and 
affection ? 
Psychologists disagree here; but all can agree on this: 
whatever you study, mind or matter, a sensation or an 
affection, there are two great questions you should always 
ask about it. They are What kind? and How much? 
The first inquires about quality, the second about quantity. 
The quality of a sensation or an affection is the property 
by which we recognize and name it. Red, green, sweet, 
hard, pain, hot, tone of middle C (on the piano) are qualities 
of sensation. We experience not less than fifty thousand 
different kinds. There are but two kinds, or qualities, of 
affection, the agreeable and the disagreeable. 
In dealing with sensations and affections, quantity is 
called intensity. The intensity of a sensation or an af- 
fection is the amount of it per unit of time. Pour out 
three glasses of water. Put two teaspoonfuls of sugar 
in one, four in the next, six in the next. Stir and taste. 
Sweet, sweeter, sweetest, hard, harder, hardest, painful, 
1Some psychologists give more. See Josiah Royce’s Outlines of Psy- 
chology, § 66; and Wundt’s Outlines of Psychology, § 7. 
s 
a

WHAT THE MIND IS MADE OF 99 
more painful, most painful, hot, hotter, hottest, loud, 
louder, loudest, are degrees of intensity. They indicate 
that some sensations hit us harder, so to speak, during 
every second of time we experience them. 
Elements and complexes. — While it is true that mind 
is made of sensations and affections, yet these elements 
never come to us singly, following one after another like 
a line of marching men. Our experience is made up of 
complexes. A complex is a group of elements. (The 
student of chemistry will observe that elements and com- 
plexes in psychology correspond to elements and com- 
pounds in chemistry.) So, an impression is an element; 
a perception, composed of impressions, is a complex. An 
image is an element; an idea, composed of images, is a 
complex. An affection is an element; a feeling, which 
always contains affection, is a complex. 
Let us here begin an outline of the structure of the mind, 
to be completed as our knowledge advances.

A sense complex is so called because sensations stand 
out the more prominently in it, as in a perception. In an 
affective complex, affection stands out the more promi- 
nently, as in a feeling of happiness. But there is no com- 
plex that does not contain sensations; and although per- 
ceptions and ideas have been spoken of as though composed
-P-A-G-E-100
  
  roo PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
purely of sensations, there is probably no conscious state 
that does not carry some trace of affection. 
Suggestions of synthesis.— You have now analyzed 
consciousness into its elements, its simplest parts. But 
mental life is a daily synthesis. The mind is a kaleido- 
scope that shifts its pattern every time a stimulus taps it. 
Even the very same elements can be composed into many 
different patterns. Your dinner would not seem the same 
if you began with the ice cream and closed with the soup; 
yet you still would get about the same impressions of taste 
as usual. “Old Glory,” with the stars in the middle, 
would be another flag. The moving picture would be 
spoiled if the film ran through the wrong way. And 
“ Annie Laurie ” would arouse much less feeling if played 
backward, though we should have the same old impressions. 
of sound, but in different order. | 
CLASS EXPERIMENT! 
The purpose of the experiment is to study the affections aroused 
by colors. 
Procure a 6 X6-inch square of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and 
violet papers. Arrange to expose two at a time through 4-inch 
windows cut near each other in a large gray cardboard. The card- 
board should be mounted on supports. A flap of cardboard, fastened 
behind the two windows by a cloth hinge at its lower edge, will hold 
the exposed papers in position. 
Take red as the first “standard” and keep it in the window at 
the students’ left, exposing the other colors successively for a few 
seconds each in the other window. As each pair is exposed, the 
student will record which arouses in him the more agreeable affection.

Each color in turn serves as standard. The whole process may 
then be repeated, but keeping the standard color on the students’ 
right. 
For scoring, each student will prepare two forms like the one be- 
low, but omitting figures and plus and minus signs. As each standard, 
whose name is at the left, is compared with the other colors, its 
horizontal column is filled with scores. Plus is a vote for the standard, 
minus is a vote for its rival. In case of no choice, record zero. 
When the scoring is completed, add plus signs horizontally and 
minus signs vertically. To get from a score card the complete score 
for any color, add its score in the Totals column at the right to its 
score in the Totals column at the bottom. Thus, on the record 
shown, the total for red is 8; for orange, 1, etc.

FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. We can teach a great deal of geography by means of moving 
pictures. Could we teach mathematics equally well by such a 
method? Why? Answer in terms of perceptions and ideas. 
2. A student gave the following story from her childhood days. 
“One day Mother took me to a picnic, and when we were on the 
steamer crossing the lake, I cried because she would not allow me to 
get in the water. I said, ‘O Mama, let me get off and walk, the

water is so nice and smooth.’” Explain the psychology of the situa- 
tion. Do perceptions usually stand alone in the mind? 
3. Name a number of images found in the idea of your home. * 
4. There are two kinds of mental element, sensation and af- 
fection. Experiment with a two-color kaleidoscope, such as you 
can buy at a toy store. Show how the mind is like a kaleidoscope. 
Or, cut red and white paper into bits, letting the red represent 
affection, the white, sensation. Make a pattern to represent a 
thoughtful state of mind; a pattern of an emotional state. 
5. Show how the popular use of the following terms differs from 
the psychological use: impression, image (remember, the image is 
simple), perceive, sensation, affection, feeling. 
6. Should you rather endure the memory of a burn, or the original 
burn itself? Just why is this? 
7. Explain, psychologically, the force of the following description.

in the great struggle for national life. . . . We see all the dead whose 
dust we have covered with flowers.”’ Robert G. Ingersoll, A Memorial.

teaching. Show why. 
9. Galton calls attention to the fact that, since our language was 
formed by “ barbarous ancestors,” it is not well adapted to the ex-

Exercises. —1. Make a list of all the senses, so far as you know 
them. Check those that children use most in getting an education. 
2. (a) Paint or otherwise apply a sample of color to a sheet of 
paper. Write an accurate description of the color and preserve the 
sheet. Record on it also descriptions of this color, given by your 
friends, independently. 
(0) When you have studied this chapter, see if you can improve | 
the above description. Just how many words (or symbols) are re- 
quired to describe a color completely ? 
3. It will be good for you, at this point, if you can begin to use 
your eyes and ears as though you had never used them before. Prac- 
tice for pure pleasure on colors and tones, as they do who have just 
received their sight or hearing.! Listen, with Riley, to the “ husky, 
rusty rustle’ of the corn, with Poe to the “ tintinabulation of the 
bells ”; and let your heart leap at the sunset, the autumn woods, and 
the emerald moss on the old gray rock. To one who can look and 
listen well, life is an endless succession of concerts and colored pictures. 
Order of appearance of the senses. — It is said that sight 
and hearing minister to the soul, the other senses to the 
body only. Anyway, there was a time when the poor, 
struggling, evolving animal race had no eyes or ears. 
First of all came such senses as touch, warmth, cold, and 
pain; then taste, which is a kind of preliminary sample 
1A man who had been blind from birth to age forty had cataracts re-

and he had exclaimed, ‘I can see!’ he became a changed man. His one

Forty, Harper’s Magazine, August, 1910.

of digestion; and smell, which is taste-at-a-distance, 
though the particles smelled must touch the smell-organ. 
Finally appeared the “‘ distance-receptors,” the ear and 
the eye. No longer need the animal grope and bump its 
way about the environment: it becomes aware of its 
pursuer or its prey while yet afar, and adapts itself to the 
situation in advance. Whether or not man will evolve 
more sense organs is a question for speculation. 
These most delicate and most precious two not only 
evolved last in the race, but appear last in the develop- 
ment of each child, minister most to our highest mental 
culture, and give way first under the strain of old age. 
With them shall begin our study of the senses. 
Physical and physiological sound. — This is no place to 
study physics and physiology, but we shall understand our 
psychology better if we observe what sound is, in the air 
and in the ear, before it appears as sensation in the mind. 
This world is full of jars and shakes; and it is highly 
important for animals to be able to receive and interpret 
the small, far-traveling, warning vibrations, in order to 
avoid being jolted or crushed by more powerful quakes 
and convulsions near at hand. So, as ships are equipped 
with a vibration receiver to detect the approach of a sub- 
marine, nature has equipped her animals with such vi- 
bration receivers. Crude shake-organs, or jar-organs, 
are found along the sides of certain fishes. The grass- 
hopper has his vibration organs, his “‘ ears,”’ under his wings. 
Man has his in his head. 
The auditory nerve has two branches, the cochlear and 
the vestibular. The vestibular branch goes to the vesti- 
bule, and to the three semicircular canals which branch out
-P-A-G-E-106
  106 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
from it. In these canals are projecting brushes of fibers 
which, when the fluid of the canal is disturbed, are stimu- 
lated. These are man’s original shake-organs, valuable 
now chiefly as balancing organs, organs of equilibrium. 
It is these that give us our sensations of dizziness, and 
which the child excites when he whirls round till every- 
thing else seems to whirl. There are three of these canals 
in each ear, one lying in each plane of space, as the three 
walls of a room come together in the corner. No matter 
how we move, then, the liquid in at least two canals (one 
in each ear) is sure to be moved. Subjects in whom these 
shake-organs do not function cannot be made dizzy by 
such whirling; neither can they sit a horse safely on the 
merry-go-round, or be sure of coming to the surface when 
they dive under water. Quite usually, they are deaf also, 
the whole ear being affected. 
We have many nerves that respond to coarse shakes and - 
vibrations. Even the deaf, at their asylums, are called 
from the fields by a steam whistle. They do not hear it; 
they “‘ feel ” its powerful vibrations. But it is the cochlear 
branch of the auditory nerve that thrills to the finer stimuli 
of this sort. This branch goes to the cochlea, or snail 
shell, where there is coiled a physiological harp of many 
strings. This minute harp is played upon by the vibrations 
of air that enter the ear, and responds, not by throwing 
out physical sounds of its own, but by sending impulses 
over the auditory nerve to the brain. 
Of course, sound vibrations may enter the ear through 
other substances, such as water. In water, sound travels 
with great momentum, and may burst the ear drum. 
Bathers sometimes play cruel and dangerous “ jokes ” on

each other by clapping stones together under water when 
the ears are submerged. 
Sound as sensation. — Sound is of two kinds, tone and 
noise. Tones result from vibrations that are regular, 
smooth, constant; noises from changeful, rough, irregular 
waves. Also, tones are more agreeable than noises, other 
things being equal. Noises, the pops, bangs, screeches, 
scrapes, thuds, groans, squeaks, booms, and roars, seem to 
be made of fragments of tones. 
Quality and intensity of sound. —In psychology, the 
quality of a sound is its pitch. The higher the rate of 
vibration, the higher the pitch. Sing or play the scale, 
and you run through a range of qualities. 
“ Quality,” as used in music, is also called timbre, or 
tone-color, and is that which enables you to tell whether 
a given tone, say “ middle c,” is whistled, sung, or played 
on this or that instrument. It depends on partial tones. 
When a string (for example) vibrates, it not only vibrates 
as a whole, but in addition, certain parts of it, the half, 
third, fourth, and so on, set up lesser vibrations of their own, 
whence come the partial tones... In the case of a voice, or a 
musical instrument such as the violin, these partial tones are 
all-important, as they make or mar the general effect. A 
tone quality, in strict psychological language, contains 
none of these partial tones, or overtones. Such a quality 
can be sounded from a tuning fork. 
Intensity of sound is loudness. Hum a tone, or sound it 
softly on an instrument, and then sound the same tone 
loudly. The difference is one of intensity.

in Figure 19 to represent quality, we can plot on it all

pitches heard by the human ear, from the lowest, which 
results from about 30 vibrations per second, to the highest, 
which enters our ears at the rate of 30,000 or 40,000 vi- 
brations per second. Between these two extremes can 
be distinguished about 10,000 tones. 
All these numbers vary with different individuals, and 
for the same individual according to age, health, etc. 
hitae Galton found that the aged lose 
their sensitivity to high tones.

interesting researches in his [n-

a To complete our chart, we 
should have to draw a hori- 
zontal line, an intensity line, 
for each of these 10,000 quali- 
ties. Only five are shown, and 
Low as the number of intensities

lengths of these cross lines are 
uncertain; but as the ear is very much more sensitive to 
high tones than to low ones, these loudness lines must grow 
longer as we go up, until we approach the upper limit of 
hearing, where the number of different intensities is small. 
Music. — Both as psychologists and as teachers, we are 
interested in the combining of tones to make music. This, 
perhaps the most complex of the arts, is determined by 
three simple factors, () rhythm (including “ time ”), 
(2) the choice of tones to be used, and (3) the gaps, or
-P-A-G-E-109
GATHERING EXPERIENCE: HEARING AND SEEING 109 
intervals left between those tones when we combine them. 
As rhythm runs through all our experiences, it will be dealt 
with elsewhere (see page 130). 
Of the 10,000 tone qualities, music employs less than a 
hundred, chosen from about the middle of the total range, 
where lie the tones of the human voice, and where the ear 
can make its finest discriminations. Of the many possible 
intensities, music uses but six, ranging from pianissimo, 
very soft, to fortissimo, very loud. 
It is the intervals between tones, however, that have 
most to do with musical effect, which distinguish Oriental 
from Western music, and major from minor scales. We 
can picture the more common intervals as below, where 
the circles stand for notes, those in the upper line being 
a half tone apart. 
Scales 
Chromatic : O)(OF 10. MOTO 0 ONO: 0. 10) On cone O 
Major: ° ° iO 0 ° ° Ono 
Harmonic Minor: o oo ° 04,10 oo 
Melodic Minor: o 0 ° ° ° 61.40 
The intervals, and hence the kind of music, that both 
nations and individuals prefer, is very largely a matter of 
habit.!. Chinese and Japanese music differ from ours, and 
1See how mechanically our Western musicians establish the “equally 
tempered” chromatic scale in common use: the a above ¢ (‘middle c”), 
they have agreed, shall be a tone of 435 vibrations per second. Then of 
course the tone an octave higher has 870 vibrations per second. They now 
divide this whole interval of 435 vibrations into 12 equal parts, half-steps, 
and distribute the 11 intervening notes accordingly. Yet so “natural” 
does it seem to sing the major scale with half-steps between notes 3 and 4, 
and notes 7 and 8, that some actually assert the human voice to be con- 
structed on this plan! If this were so, all nations and tribes would use it. 
Habit determines the matter.

both from each other. Even in chords, where perfection 
of harmony is determined by absence of “ beats,” fashion 
reigns. Modern ears can tolerate more beating, and find 
beauty in it, than could those of long ago. 
Visual impressions. — If the colors seem a little complex, 
it is because nature has made so many of them, and has 
given us such wonderful eyes with which to 
vee view them. But we can greatly simplify 
our study by arranging the many thousands 
HIGH, OR of colors into a system of some kind. Na- 
VALUES ture has begun the system by arranging 
the colors of the rainbow, and by giving 
MIDDLE>PGRAY us every gradation of gray from lightest 
to darkest as we pass from white daylight 
rac through the twilight hour into the black- 
eee ness of night. 
Let us begin with these grays. If we lay 
BLACK down black at one end of a scale and white 
Fic. 20.—A at the other, filling in the dark grays, mid- 
oo dle gray, and the light grays between, we 
BY: find that the average eye can easily distin- 
guish some ten steps of difference in passing from end to end 
of it. This is indicated in Figure 20. Middle gray stands 
halfway between black and white. All the grays above the 
middle are high, or light, values, and all below middle gray 
are low, or dark, values. This makes a value scale of 8 grad- 
uated steps from black through the neutral grays to white. 
We are now ready to construct the color pyramid — for 
nothing less than a three-dimensional solid will enable us 
to show the three dimensions of color, that is, the three 
ways in which colors differ from one another. Taking the 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  GATHERING EXPERIENCE: HEARING AND SEEING III 
scale of grays as our axis (having white and black as its 
poles), we build upon it our double pyramid of color. 
(See Figures 21 and 22.) 
Such a solid includes all the colors with which either 
nature or art ever stimulates our eyes. 
Now for the three dimensions of color, hue, value, and 
chroma. 
  Fic. 21. — Base and axis of the color pyramid. 
Hue.— Hue is what gives a color its place in the rainbow 
(orspectrum). It also gives to the color its common name. 
Experimenters have distinguished about 150 different hues ; 
but the number of names in common use is much more lim- 
ited. In Figure 21 appear the initials of four of the most 
used names, Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue. Lying between 
each pair are found, respectively, yellow-red (‘‘ orange ”’), 
green-yellow, blue-green, and purple-blue (“ violet ”). 
All the hues, then, are found by following the outline of the 
base of the pyramid, as from R to Y, to G, to B, and finally 
back to R again. It is somewhat as if a rainbow had been 
wrapped around a figure whose shape approaches a square.
-P-A-G-E-112
  112 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Value. — Value is lightness (or darkness) of color. On 
the pyramid, each hue grows gradually lighter from the base 
to the upper pole, gradually darker from the base to the 
lower pole. At the north pole is white; at the south pole, 
black. On the base itself are the middle values of all 
hues; above the base are the high, or light, values ; below 
the base, the low, or dark, values.! 
Chroma. — Chroma is strength (saturation) of color. 
In addition to being light or dark, hues are either strong 
or weak. With crayon or water color, lay down a strip of 
any hue of medium value on a sheet of middle gray paper. 
Make the color strong at one end of the strip, then weaken 
it gradually till it is lost in the gray of the paper. Or, if 
your “blackboard” is gray instead of black, as most 
slates are, you can perform this experiment easily, and 
accurately enough for practical purposes, by using the side 
of a piece of colored chalk. Here you have about the same 
hue and value throughout, but different chromas, satura- 
tions, strengths, of the color. 
In the color pyramid, if you draw from any point on the 
surface (say R), a horizontal, it will pass through a similar 
succession of chromas, ending with some value of gray at 
the axis. The interior of the pyramid, then, is full of colors, 
of hundreds of hues, values, and chromas. On the axis are 
the neutral colors, black, white, and every value of gray 
between. 
Consider further the location of the hues: as said above, 
we can find them all by following the perimeter of the com- 
mon base of the two pyramids. But the hues so found are 
1“Tint” is sometimes used to indicate light value, and “shade” for 
dark value.
-P-A-G-E-113
  GATHERING EXPERIENCE: HEARING AND SEEING 113 
of strong chroma, full saturation, like the colors of the rain- 
bow, and of medium value. We can also find all hues by 
going about the pyramid above or below the base, along 
lines parallel to its sides, in which case the hues are a suc- 
cession of tints or shades. Finally, we can find all the hues, 
in weakened chroma, by going inside the pyramid and 
following such a path as R, Y, G, B. 
It will pay you to practice describing, in terms of hue, 
value, and chroma, the colors you would find at various 
points on and in the color pyramid. 
Color as used in the schoolroom. — At the points of the 
pyramid, we find the extreme colors, the strongest that 
either man or nature has produced. But no artist makes 
much use of them. Our best pictures are painted in milder 
colors, that is, in weaker chromas, “ subdued” by the 
mixing in of gray. 
Young children, like all other instinctive creatures that 
have color vision, may enthuse most at first over the colors 
that are most flaring, just as they run after the blaring 
circus band. But it should be a part of their education to 
learn to appreciate the milder and more mentally hygienic 
colors, and to choose and use them. 
Such taste and choice cannot be acquired by rule alone, 
but is a personal art, to be gained by long practice and 
criticism. From kindergarten to college, we exhort our 
pupil to express himself in agreeable tones and combinations 
of words pleasing to the ear; yet self-expression in color is 
more constant. 
Let us make an equal effort to secure agreeable colors 
and combinations of color pleasing to the eye, on every 
wall and wayside, in all dress and adornment.

Physical and physiological color. — Physicists tell us 
there is a substance, called ether, much finer than air, too 
fine to be seen or touched, but spread throughout space. 
As physical sound is vibrations in air (chiefly), so physical 
color is vibrations in ether. These minute ether vibrations 
come pulsing into the eye at the rate of many billions per

Further, ordinary sunlight is a perfect harmony of all 
the colors of the rainbow, with their various wave lengths, 
from the longest wave which makes red, to the shortest, 
which makes violet.’ 
With a triangular prism, you can break up sunlight into 
its various colors, as nature does in the rainbow. Observe 
the order in which they occur. 
But the retina of the primitive eye responds only to

discouraged. Avoid also the application of musical terms to color, such as

. : 
black, white, and the grays. Such an eye saw just what 
the ordinary camera sees and photographs. The owl, the 
mole, and people who are totally color blind, still have such 
eyes. In dim light, we are all “ color blind,” in a sense; 
for then very little or no chroma can be seen. Later in 
the course of evolution, there appeared on the retina a 
roughly circular patch of a substance which is sensitive to 
the yellows and blues.2 Such an eye could see all colors 
except the reds and the greens. It is possible that even in 
historic times man has improved in color vision, for delvers 
in Homeric and Biblical research think they have discovered 
signs that the ancient writers had color vision less developed 
than ours. 
Still later, probably, appeared another and still smaller 
patch of film, lying straight back from the pupil as you 
look into your neighbor’s eye, and sensitive to the waves 
of red and of blue-green. Color vision was then complete 
—as complete as human beings have it. 
We may call these three nearly concentric patches of 
film the white-black zone, the yellow-blue zone, and the 
red-green zone — though of course the films themselves 
are not so colored. Each zone can see all that any larger 
zone can see, but is blind to the colors that any zone 
smaller than itself can see. According to Hering’s theory 
of color vision, now commonly accepted among psy- 
chologists, white, yellow, and red tear down, chemically 
1 There is such a thing as color blindness which depends on the brain 
instead of the eye, but it is extremely rare. 
2 The color names are here used to indicate large sectors of the color 
pyramid. “ Yellow” includes, roughly, all the colors in the neighborhood 
of yellow.

116 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
decompose their respective films; and black, blue, and 
green build them up. Observe how tiresome are much 
bright white or strong red or yellow in your surroundings. 
‘You never paper a room with such stimuli, nor use much 
of them in your everyday clothing. Our eyes are “ beauti- 
fully adapted to look long at the canopy of blue above us 
and the sheet of green below.” 
If either the tearing down or the building up process 
is carried to an extreme, its opposite begins. Look steadily 
at a patch of red for fifteen seconds, then shift your gaze 
to a point on a sheet of middle gray 8 for a few seconds 
more. The retina starts the building up process, and this 
is the seeing of blue-green, so far as the eye is concerned. 
Such an after-impression is commonly called an “ after- 
image.” If it is the opposite of the original, as in this case, 
it is called negative; if it is a continuation of the original, 
as when a whirling spark seems to be a circle of fire, it is 
called positive. The “ tail” of a rocket is chiefly positive 
after-impression. 
If equal and opposite stimuli fall alternately on the 
appropriate zone, — for example, if the color wheel causes 
equal areas of red and blue-green (of proper value and 
chroma) to stimulate alternately the red-green zone, the 
building up and tearing down are equal, as when a man 
lays up bricks with one hand and lays them down with the 
other. The result is nil: one sees middle gray. This 
results from the usual action of the brain cells, and is just 
what a blind man sees all the time, in so far as he sees any- 
thing.

CLASS EXERCISES 
1. Gaze at patches of various colors about 15 seconds each and 
then project the after-sensations on a sheet of middle gray. Do not 
permit the gaze to wander. 
Try to formulate a law that will enable you to predict the after- 
sensation of any such stimulus. 
2. Show (roughly) that if any two colors of the pyramid are 
mixed on the color wheel,! the resulting color lies on the straight 
line that joins the two, and at a distance from each which is inversely 
proportional to the amount of each color included. 
3. Find or make pairs of colors which, when mixed about half 
and half on the color wheel, produce approximately a middle gray. 
(Such colors are called complementary.) 
Show that this is simply a special case of the law of mixture, given 
above. 
4. Illustrate change of value in any color by adding white or 
black. 
Illustrate change of chroma by adding gray of about the same value 
(that is, of about the same level in the color pyramid) as that of the 
color itself. 
Using disks of different diameter, change the value of the smaller 
red by adding 50 per cent of white, and the chroma of the larger red 
of the same hue by adding 50 per cent of gray. Display them 
together on the wheel. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Suggest all the facts you can think of to explain why tones 
should ever have come to be called “ high ” and “ low.’ Where do 
the height and the lowness come in? 
2. If you have an opportunity to hear Indian or other unusual 
music, try to explain its effect in terms of rhythm, choice of tones, 
and intervals. 
1 An inexpensive color wheel can be obtained from dealers in kindergarten 
materials. It is well to have two complete sets of disks, of different 
diameters.

statement and show that it is based on the difference between physical 
and mental sound. 
4. Whirl about with your head in different positions, (a) up- 
right, as usual, (6) face upward or downward, and (c) reclined nearly 
on the shoulder. Notice, in each case, how things seem to move 
when you stop. All depends on which semi-circular canal you 
stimulate, and the direction in which its fluid tends to move. ‘Try 
to work out a law for this, so you can predict what will happen in 
any case. 
Is it any wonder that the whirling dervishes can bring on a sacred 
fit in this way?

Which do you like, which dislike? How do you want your voice to 
sound when you teach ? 
6. Practice bounding the hues. Thus red lies between red-blue 
(violet) and yellow-red (orange).

base of the color pyramid; (6) any cross-section you choose that 
cuts the axis lengthwise.

to. Describe completely and accurately many colors that you 
find in nature, clothing, decorations, etc. 
11. Select pictures whose color combinations please; others (such 
as those found in certain Sunday newspapers) that displease. Study 
the colors and try to explain the effect. 
12. Every human complexion can be matched by combining red, 
yellow, white, and black (or some of these) in the right proportions. 
Has this any significance for dress? 
13. Would not the United States flag be more artistic if its chromas 
were weakened? Do you wish them reduced? Why? What is a

strong chroma. Keeping your eye fixed on some point in front, ex-

tend the arm backward and then bring the red slowly around toward 
the front. Can you see it as an object before you can tell its color? 
Can you tell when the rays of light from it are crossing the yellow- 
blue zone of your retina? Try this with other colors, and on other 
people, who do not know which color is to appear. 
15. The most common form of color blindness is blindness to 
reds and greens. What is the meaning of this? Which color film 
of the retina is the smaller? The more likely to be absent or de- 
fective? 
16. Why do oculists prescribe blue, green, or gray glasses for 
sensitive eyes? Why not white, yellow, or red ones?

second at a temperature of 68° Fahrenheit. Many pitches have pre- 
vailed in different countries at different times. At the time of Handel 
and Mozart, the pitch was lower (422.5 and 421.6). England has 
had the pitch run as high as 454.7 and the United States as high 
as 460.8.” (Quoted from Gardner, p. 48. See References.) How 
do you explain this?

Exercises. —1. Analyze the “taste”? of ice cream. In other 
words, make a list of all the impressions you get by way of the mouth 
when you eat ice cream. Should you like it as well if it were as hot 
as coffee? If it were black and brittle like anthracite coal ? 
2. Place an object, such as a button or a coin, in an ordinary 
washbowl. Step back until the object is just out of sight behind the 
edge of the bowl, and then have some one fill it with water. Now 
take a pointer and thrust the end of it in where the object seems 
to you to be. Did you touch it? Explain. Of course, the water 
bends the rays of light; but this is the physical part of the explana- 
tion. Why did you not see the object just where it actually was, 
in spite of the bent rays? 
Having studied hearing and sight, we shall now take up 
the remaining senses. 
Gustatory impressions. — To the primitive animal, taste 
is the fore-test of digestion: what smacks well in the mouth 
sits well in the stomach. And this is true of man when 
he follows his appetite carefully, rationally, introspectively. 
But our cookery is too often the art of bribing the tongue 
instead of serving the stomach. It might be better if we 
were more like the amceba, which probably gets most of 
its taste experiences while digestion is going on! 
Observe the tip of your tongue and you will find it flecked 
with small specks of strong pink. These are bud-like 
formations, called taste buds, lodged in the walls of the 
furrows of the tongue. In them are spread out the fibers 
of the three nerves of taste. These buds are found chiefly 
120
-P-A-G-E-121
GATHERING EXPERIENCE: IMPRESSION, PERCEPTION 121 
at the tip of the tongue, where we taste sweet best; at 
the back, where we taste bitter best, and at the sides, where 
sour is strongest. Salt can be tasted at all three points. 
All our complex tastes can be reduced to these four simple 
ones — sweet, bitter, sour, and salt. 
Much of what we commonly call taste is touch, tempera- 
ture, or smell. If we hold our noses, medicine does not 
“taste” so bad, and potato can scarcely be distinguished 
from apple. Yet the sense can be cultivated to extreme 
nicety. There is a story, which appears to be reliable, 
of two expert winetasters who shocked a wine merchant 
by tasting, one leather, the other, iron, in his finest wine. 
Later, a tack with a leather head was found in the cask. 
The sense repays reasonable cultivation by its aid in test- 
ing food, chemicals, and the like. 
Olfactory impressions. — To the lower animals, smell is 
indispensable, and so is constantly sharpened by exercise. 
The dog can track his master by smell, but the master can 
hardly track his dog by this method. Smell, as Titchener 
says, is a “ground sense.” It is found at its keenest 
and used most by those animals, such as the dog and the 
cat, whose noses are constantly near the ground, and which 
depend on their sense of smell to get them a living. Evo- 
lution, in giving man an erect posture and an upward gaze, 
has lifted his nose from the ground and given him less use 
for smelling. But if we feel above those humble animals 
which do so much nosing around, the birds may feel superior 
to us, for at their height they have so little use for smell that 
they have almost lost the sense, and so depend on their 
eyes and ears instead of their noses.

  122 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
But this humble sense is well worth cultivating: it is 
useful in cookery and chemistry and many other under- 
takings. Aside from the charm of agreeable odors, there 
"are many practical situations where health or even life 
itself, may depend on the sense of smell. 
Round every odorous body is a cloud, usually invisible, 
of floating particles that enter the nostrils and make con- 
tact with’ two little smell spots, sensitive patches of mucous 
membrane lying up in the dome of the nasal passages. As 
the smell spots are above the usual breathing currents, we 
commonly carry the stimulus up to them by sniffing. 
If smells could only be classified and systematized, like 
tones and colors, we might be able to produce a perfect 
concord of sweet smells, a music of odors; but they are 
very numerous, and so far, they seem as vagrant and un- 
related as random tones and colors must be to a little 
child. 
Many smells are markedly agreeable or disagreeable. 
But odorless air is best, not laden even with a sweet smelling 
savor. Foul smells often cause immediate nausea — na- 
ture’s warning that back of the ugly odor there is probably 
something injurious to general health. In the schoolroom, 
we must make every effort, by health, cleanliness, and 
ventilation, to keep the air so fresh and pure that it is 
odorless. 
Impressions from the skin. — The skin gives us touch, 
warmth, cold, and pain. So do many other organs; but 
we are especially interested in the skin because it stands, 
so to speak, between us and the outside world. 
The nerves of these senses come to the surface — or 
near it, in spots, irregularly distributed, for the most part, 
   
-P-A-G-E-123
ae ee ee ee Cr eee 
GATHERING EXPERIENCE: IMPRESSION, PERCEPTION 123 
and varying in number on different parts of the body. 
On the average, we have, for every warmth spot, ten 
“cold spots,” ten touch spots, and forty pain spots. The 
tip of the tongue and the finger tips are most sensitive to 
touch — and most mobile, let us observe. 
All these nerves, except those for pain, have special ends, 
“ corpuscles,” “bulbs,” and so on. The pain nerves 
simply taper to an end. Pain, then, is a sensation which 
results from the stimulating of “ free’ nerve endings, as 
they are called. It includes itch, prick, and ache, as well 
as common pain, and may be agreeable or disagreeable. 
Pain is frequently confused with disagreeable affection, 
and hence the word is commonly misused. Pain is not 
the opposite of pleasure. 
It is very important for the teacher to know that we can- 
not trust our temperature sense in judging the heat of a 
room. What we experience is the temperature of our 
skin rather than that of the surrounding air, and they are 
not always the same. In every living room there should be 
an objective standard in the form of a reliable thermometer, 
to guide us. 
All other skin experiences, such as wetness, roughness, 
tickle, and burning, are complexes, and include no im- 
pressions outside of touch, warmth, cold, and pain. 
The tactual-motor sense. — Touch, and especially the 
intense form of touch called pressure, is not confined to 
theskin. In the tissues beneath the skin, in muscle, tendon, 
joint, and bone, are special nerve-endings sensitive to con- 
tact and pressure. These give us our sensations of re- 
sistance and movement, called kinesthetic sensations. 
The kinesthetic sensations include pressure, the strain of
-P-A-G-E-124
  124. PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
resistance (as that experienced in a finger joint when we 
pull it), the effort of active movement, and fatigue. 
These kinesthetic senses, acting with those of the skin 
(especially touch), form what may well be called the 
tactual-motor sense, the touch-movement sense. In esti- 
mating the weight of objects, you can do better by lifting 
them than by letting them rest on your motionless hand. 
In judging extent of movement, you can do better when you 
move across the object than when the object moves across 
you. Tactual-motor sensations from about the joints tell 
us, even with eyes closed, how far the limbs have moved. 
The joints most sensitive to angular movement are the 
wrist, shoulder, and those between hand and fingers. The 
elbow and joints within the fingers are less sensitive. Such 
sensitivity is greater for rapid than for slow movement. 
Every part of the body has greater discriminating power 
when permitted to move. The moving hand is the most 
sensitive exploring organ we possess. 
Probably the value of the tactual-motor sense, both in 
and out of school, is commonly overlooked. In dressing, 
eating, writing, moving about, we constantly depend on it. 
Men can learn to shave and women to adjust hair and hats 
without a mirror. The fingers of the violinist “ have 
eyes” that guide him better than his real eyes possibly 
could. A rat, deprived of sight and smell, can beat a 
human being who has both, in learning the way through a 
labyrinth. Touch typewriting and touch piano playing 
are not difficult. Nor can the blind excel us in tactual- 
motor accomplishments when we exert ourselves. 
Organic impressions. — These are sensations from the 
maintenance systems of the body, the digestive, circulatory,
-P-A-G-E-125
GATHERING EXPERIENCE: IMPRESSION, PERCEPTION 125 
respiratory, excretory, and reproductive systems. Hunger, 
thirst, nausea, suffocation, and the like belong here, either 
as elements or complexes. Thirst is due largely to the 
drying and contracting of the mucous membrane of the 
mouth and throat. Hunger is caused principally by con- 
tractions of the stomach. At the Harvard Medical School, 
a student swallowed a rubber bag, which was then inflated 
through its attached tube. The subject pressed a lever 
at the intermittent onsets of hunger. The movements 
of this lever followed those of another which, out of sight 
of the student, registered the pressure of the stomach on 
the inflated bag, showing that the sensation of hunger and 
the contraction of the stomach occurred together. 
Organic sensations have a variety of stimuli, food in the 
stomach, cold air in the lungs, changes in circulation, etc. 
They are for the most part rather vague, hard to localize 
and to analyze, but important because they signify so di- 
rectly the well-being or ill-being of the body, and contribute 
so much to our emotions. 
Laws common to all impressions. — A sensation is not, of 
course, a fixed thing, carried bodily from the outside world 
into the mind. It is a process, and so a kind of compro- 
mise between the stimulus and the condition of the nervous 
system that receives it. The same stimulus may produce 
different results, chiefly according to the following laws. 
Adaptation. — Long stimulation is followed by a fading 
impression. The nose soon adapts itself to odors, sweet 
or foul, and we cease to smell them. Teachers and pupils 
become adapted to an overheated schoolroom, to the 
detriment of their health. Stare at a point in the land- 
scape for a minute or two and its colors fade. Stay in a 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
room that seems at first blindingly light or dark and you 
will soon be able to see. If sweet were always in the mouth, 
there would be no sweet. If we want to be extreme and 
paradoxical, we may say that to have an experience all 
the while is not to have it at all. 
Contrast. — Opposites enhance each other. This ap- 
plies to both quality and intensity. Red cheeks look 
redder against a green gown and hat. Frosty air makes 
fire welcome. Spring out of doors makes the schoolroom 
dingier than ever. Sweet, lingering in your mouth, makes 
sour more sour. The bright and the dull increase each 
other. Only as contrast breaks up adaptation can we 
hope for variety of experience. 
Facilitation and inhibition. — One stimulus may 
strengthen, weaken, or destroy the effect of another, as 
already shown (see p. 64). The second flash of light or 
the second calling of our name may rouse us when the 
first one fails to do so. The first stimulus seems to clear 
the nerve channels for the second. Or the two stimuli 
may come together. Laying your hand on a pupil’s 
shoulder and speaking to him at the same time make 
each more effective. 
On the other hand, complementary colors may destroy 
each other and give no color. Hot coffee kills all cooler 
tastes. Dazzling light excludes all else. A mischievous 
boy may extract a hair without the victim’s knowledge 
by rapping him sharply on the head as he pulls. In the 
schoolroom, it is a rare page of print that can compete with 
loud noises. 
Impressions fuse to form perceptions. — We have al- 
ready found that a perception is a unified group of im-
-P-A-G-E-127
  
GATHERING EXPERIENCE: IMPRESSION, PERCEPTION 127 
pressions. But the impressions do not group themselves 
mechanically, each maintaining a square-faced inde- 
pendence, like so many bricks forming a wall. They are 
more like currents of colored water or beams of colored 
light, which mingle, change, and even suppress each other. 
A peach falls from the tree with a soft thud (auditory 
impression). You pick it up and dent it with your thumb 
(tactual-motor impressions), gaze at its beautiful colors 
(visual impressions), smell and taste it (olfactory and 
gustatory impressions). But ordinarily, you make no such 
careful inventory of impressions. They flow together into 
the one experience, peach. A young man who was suffer- 
ing a touch of love at first sight was asked the color of his 
lady’s eyes. He was unable to tell, although he had been 
in her presence for hours. 
How much or how little is included in one grasp of per- 
ception depends on one’s state of mind, especially his pur- 
pose. The fruit buyer may take in a carload of peaches 
at a glance; the housewife, a quart; the artist, a group of 
two or three; the biologist, a single cell of peach pulp. 
Every teacher should practice looking over the heads of 
her pupils until she can see her whole room at a glance. 
Classes of perception. — Perceptions are often named 
according to the class of impressions that predominate, 
as olfactory, or gustatory. Most prominent are the visual, 
auditory, tactual-motor, and mixed. A mixed perception 
is one composed of a goodly proportion of various kinds 
of impression, as that of the peach, described above. 
Perceptive types. — Corresponding to the chief classes 
of perception are the types of perceiver, visual, auditory, 
tactual-motor, and mixed. In the case of the great ma- 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
   
     128 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
jority of children, learning flows in fastest and best through 
the channel of the eye — note how much eye learning there 
is in the average schoolroom. But the increasing emphasis 
on manual training, domestic art, play, gardening, and the 
like, is an indication that in the old-fashioned school, 
tactual-motor learning was all too rare. The younger ‘the 
child, the more of a tactual-motor learner he is likely to be. 
False perceptions. — Ordinarily, you expect your news 
to be true news. But the old symbols or signals, sent 
in in the old way, are 
<—______> sometimes deceiving, as 
when a false fire alarm 
——— is turned in. It sounds 
Fic. 23.— The Mueller-Lyer illusion. the same, at head- 
quarters, as «a> jtrue 
alarm, and the firemen respond in the same way. 
Similarly, the brain may be deceived. When you see a 
crooked stick lying across the dim wood path, you may 
have the very impressions that ordinarily mean “ snake,” 
and the brain responds as it would if you had actually seen 
one. The well-known Mueller-Lyer illusion is given in 
the figure (Fig. 23). The horizontal lines, really of the 
same length, appear of unequal lengths because of the 
angles at the ends, which urge the eye to “ go on” or 
“ hold back.” 
A false perception of a real object is called an illusion. 
A hallucination is a false perception of an unreal object. 
One who is drunk or highly nervous may see snakes where 
there are none — not even crooked sticks. The dead have 
been “ seen ” in open daylight, alive and active, by persons 
otherwise normal. Students, sitting in their own rooms,
-P-A-G-E-129
  GATHERING EXPERIENCE: IMPRESSION, PERCEPTION 129 
have spoken to friends whom they “ saw ”’ 
those friends were certainly nowhere about. 
But usually there is some objective hint of the object sup- 
posedly perceived. Enlarged blood vessels in the eye may 
be projected as snakes. Clouds suggest angels. The white 
streak becomes a ghost. The essential condition is that the 
brain tract in which a certain idea is recorded shall be so 
excited as to make that idea “‘as real as life,” that is, as in- 
tense as a perception, whereupon it can readily be projected 
and mistaken for one. Occasional experiences of this kind 
are quite common; but frequent or persistent hallucination 
is a strong symptom of insanity — is insanity, in fact. 
Strictly speaking, the illusion and the hallucination are 
not false perceptions, but false ideas started by a perception 
or other objective suggestion. There js no sharp dividing 
line between them: the illusion shades into the hallucina- 
tion, and this into the delusion. A delusion, as James 
says, is “a false opinion about a 
matter of fact,” as when the insane 
patient thinks himself a king. 
Apperception.—This overworked 
word has many meanings, too in- 
tricate and rambling to be dis- 
cussed here. The essential fact is 
this: we perceive according to our past. Nerve paths have 
been opened by old experience, and new perceptions follow 
the law of least resistance. This causes certain determin- 
ing impressions to stand out and fix the general character 
of the whole perception. An old but good example of this 
is given in the figure (Fig. 24). It is perceived as duck or 
as rabbit according to the post of the perceiver. Most of entering, when 
  Fic. 24. — Duck or rabbit?
-P-A-G-E-130
   
   130 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
us, who are familiar with both duck and rabbit, can make 
it shift from one to the other under our eyes. 
The child who calls a fern “ a pot of green feathers,”’ who 
speaks of roast chicken as “ hen-beef,” or (being familiar 
with locomotives) names the steamboat, coffee pot, spirit 
lamp, or anything else that hisses or smokes, a locomotive, 
or applies the term “ star ”’ to the candle, gas flame, and the 
like, is apperceiving, “interpreting the new by the old.” ! 
Note that apperception depends on the ideas present, 
rather than on the perception pure and simple. Whenever 
impressions enter the mind, they are met by a rush of old | 
friends, namely, the images that have previously been 
associated with these impressions. It is largely this re- 
ception committee of images which steers the course of 
the apperception. 
Perception of rhythm. — Rhythm lies deep in nature. 
It is the pulse of her heart. We find it in the speeding 
and slowing of the earth in its course round the sun, in 
the ebb and flow of tides, in the seasons, in our heart- 
beat, our footfall, our daily rise and fall of energy, our pulses 
of mental effort. 
Rhythm, considered subjectively, is the regular repetition 
of experience. There is a rhythm of time and of space. 
Temporal rhythm is best illustrated by the flow of sounds 
in music and in poetry. Spatial rhythm appears in the 
regular recurrence of columns, arches, windows, spires, 
and other units used in building. Architecture is indeed 
“frozen music.” We dislike big blank areas of wall: 
the music must not be all rests. 
1 These illustrations are taken from T. G. Rooper’s A Pot of Green Feathers. 
Every teacher should read this delightful and enlightening monograph.    
-P-A-G-E-131
GATHERING EXPERIENCE: IMPRESSION, PERCEPTION I3f 
It is interesting to note how rhythm, and especially ac- 
cented rhythm, flows through our common life. The 
march, the dance, the flowered paper on the wall, friezes 
and frets, designs in tiles and in carpets, the chant, the song, 
the poem — all show how deeply rhythm throbs through 
our natures. 
Perception of space. — If we take an inventory of the 
senses, we find two only which help us much in determin- 
ing how the outer world is arranged around us. These 
are sight and the tactual-motor sense. 
Two observations are important: 
1. A two-dimensional sense organ enables us to perceive 
two-dimensional space ! (that is, plane surfaces). A patch 
of skin, like the retina of the eye, is spread out so as to 
enable us to perceive length and breadth; but neither tells 
us anything of the third dimension, distance out from the 
body. If we had to perceive the world through such a 
patch of skin, or a retina, fixed in its place, we might work 
out plane geometry, but of solid geometry we should have 
no idea whatever. 
2. Only movement (including movement of the eyes 
and the small muscles connected therewith) can tell us 
of distance out from the body. The baby reaches for the 
moon, actually expecting to grasp it, as he does his balloon. 
The born-blind, on receiving their sight at maturity, think 
all objects close to their eyes, and keep their hands up for 
1 Provided the points in the sensitive surface of the sense organ can be 
so stimulated as to make them correspond to the points in the surface per- 
ceived. The smell-patches in the nose present a sensitive surface spread 
out in two dimensions; but they are stimulated by a puff of odorous air, 
and not point by point. 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  132 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
protection as they go about. One such subject, on seeing 
a picture, painted in perspective, ran his hands over it 
and then asked which was the lying sense, sight or touch, 
explaining that his hands made it out to be flat, while his 
eyes saw it as stretching off a great distance from him. 
Observe that the “ movement” which alone gives us 
information of distance out from the body, includes muscular 
contractions which are very minute, very obscure, but very 
significant. Such are the movements of the muscles of 
the eyes, especially those which converge the eyeballs and 
focus the lenses. With practice, our judgments of space, 
based on such minor movements, come to be very accurate. 
The big lesson for us teachers to learn from the study 
of space perception is the importance of tactual-motor 
impressions in getting our bearings in this world and esti- 
mating its distances. Only by pushing our way through 
space do we ever come to know space thoroughly. See 
how much your shop-loving, bicycle-riding boy beats the 
library-haunting girl in estimating distances and measure- 
ments of all kinds. The school must have plenty of move- 
ment in it if it aims to make its pupils experience the world 
as well ordered in space. 
CLASS EXPERIMENTS 
Testing the Range of Perception 
1. Make a tachistoscope by fastening two four-foot uprights one 
foot apart, so as to support a sliding board three feet long. At the 
center of the board, cut out a square of ten-inch side. On white, 
foot-square pasteboards, leaving a margin of two inches, paste 
(a) squares of black paper, (b) large black letters, (c) short words, 
(d) pictures of objects, or (e) patches of different hue, all in a non-

symmetrical pattern. All should be clear to the eye, across a room. 
A series of each kind may be prepared, so as to expose anywhere from 
three to ten objects when the board falls. Two feet from the floor, 
fix a support for these pasteboards. 
Raise the slide. (It may be held by a nail which moves through 
the upright.) Then fix a cardboard in place. Let all gaze where 
they know the cardboard to be. (A tack or a bit of paper will fix 
the gaze.) Drop the slide. (Felt placed beneath it will deaden the 
noise.) Let all record what they have seen, after which the in- 
structor will state the number of objects actually on the card. Record 
this also. The average for the class may be computed at the close, 
taking from each student the highest number he perceived correctly 
every time. 
2. The ear may be tested by one-to-several tones produced simul- 
taneously on harp or piano, or by noises of various sorts. What is 
the greatest number of tones that a musician should put into a chord ? 
3. Thrust pins slightly through a cardboard, keeping them about 
one eighth of an inch from each other. Make groups of from one to 
eight. Test as to the number distinguishable by a finger tip. How 
many points can safely be used in forming a raised alphabet for the 
blind? 
Would practice be likely to extend the range of perception?. How 
could you find out ?

An abundance of low-priced material to illustrate illusions can be 
obtained from the Milton Bradley Company, Springfield, Mass.

  CHAPTER IX 
RECORDING AND REPRODUCING EXPERIENCE 
Exercise. — How can you memorize fastest, through the eye, 
the ear, or the hand? To help you answer this question, memorize 
the nonsense syllables given below. So far as possible, stick to the 
syllables themselves and pay no attention to what they suggest. 
(For example, sov might suggest sovereign.) Note the time required 
in each case until you are just able to repeat the list correctly. Rest 
a little between tasks. 
First, to familiarize yourself with nonsense syllables and get 
practice on them, memorize the following list by the method you 
commonly use: var, mup, tib, sov, raz, bal, vej, zik, tev, kes. 
Now, memorize the following by using the eye only, picturing 
each word carefully: rad, guf, dut, nib, wap, cag, taz, ber, fon, tig. 
Have some one read to you the following list at the rate of about 
one per second, repeating the reading until you can give the whole 
correctly: tol, kuf, jer, kus, pif, geb, mez, fex, reg, fik. 
'Finally, copy the following repeatedly until you can give them

As already stated, the brain (1) gathers experience, 
(2) records and reproduces experience, (3) analyzes ex- 
perience, (4) synthesizes experience, and (5) expresses 
130

RECORDING AND REPRODUCING EXPERIENCE 137 
experience in behavior. We have studied (in Chapters VIT 
and VIII) the gathering of experience through the sense 
organs. We take up next the recording and reproducing 
of experience. In other words, we shall now study 
memory. 
What if we had no memory? — We have likened the 
brain to a moving-picture factory. In the sensitive film 
there used, the pictures are preserved, and may be repro- 
duced at will. But if we had no memory, the brain would 
be like a looking-glass, picturing everything that came 
before it, but only so long as that thing was present. No 
image would remain to represent the object when it was 
taken away. Close the sense organs, and the brain would 
be as blank as a mirror in the dark. 
A man without a memory would have no idea of yester- 
day or of to-morrow. A nation of such people would have 
no conscious history or anticipation of a hereafter. There 
would be practically no imagination, nor continuous 
thought, nor science, nor preparation for the future. In 
our conduct, we should be as helpless as feeble-minded 
children. : 
Because of this, certain mongers of memory systems 
make such extravagant declarations as that “ you are no 
greater than your memory.” They might as well say you 
are no greater than your bank account. Memory, like 
money, is indispensable in moderate amount; but one 
may easily spend too much time accumulating. We show 
our caliber by the use we make of what we have. 
Of course, as James says, it is the man whose learning 
sticks who can keep building on it and advancing. But he 
1 Principles of Psychology, Vol. I, p. 60.  
-P-A-G-E-138
  
138 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
warns us that mere native tenacity will not make one great 
unless backed up by unusual feeling and extraordinary 
intelligence. He quotes the case of a young man who had 
with difficulty been taught to read and speak, yet who 
could so mentally photograph an ordinary page of print 
by two or three minutes of study that he could then spell 
out the words from memory as well as if the book lay open 
before him. A second example from the same author is 
that of a Pennsylvania farmer, almost blind, who could 
recall the day of the week for each date of over forty 
years, the nature of the weather, and his occupation on 
each day. 
What is memory? — Memory, like habit, depends on 
the fact that the nervous system preserves in itself a record 
of what it has gone through, tends to do again what it has 
done before. The sounding boards of violin and piano 
preserve in their structure the results of past activity and 
throw back the general quality of the notes to which they 
have vibrated most frequently. Paper, once folded, folds 
_again accordingly. The stream glides easily in the old 
channel. The knife blade, once magnetized, holds its 
new behavior for long. The brain, once thrilled by an 
experience, may reproduce it indefinitely. 
It is the brain, then, not the mind, that remembers. 
The brain is the candle: mind, including our remembered 
experience, is the flame. Memory is the power of the 
brain to record experience and ‘reproduce it. Or, expressed 
more precisely i in terms of mind, we may say memory is 
experience recognized as reproduced. 
Experience may be repeated from the brain records 
alone, in the form of ideas, as when we say over some old, 
   
-P-A-G-E-139
RECORDING AND REPRODUCING EXPERIENCE 139 
familiar gem of poetry; or in the form of perceptions, 
as when we realize, on traveling a certain road, that we 
have passed over it. before, though we could not have 
described it. So, a song sung to us may be recognized as 
old, though we could not have revived it from our brain 
records. 
When we wish to be very accurate, it is well to use the 
word “ recognize ” if the experience is repeated in the form 
of perceptions, reserving the term “ memory ”’ to indicate 
the reproduction and recognition of ideas. We should 
hardly be willing to say that a child remembers his mul- 
tiplication table if he merely recognizes it when it is 
shown to him in the book. The word “ recollect ” is used 
to refer to the very definite and detailed placing of an event 
in one’s past, as when a witness recollects the exact. day of 
an event, where he was going, whom he talked with, etc. 
You may remember the multiplication table without being 
able to recollect just where or when you first saw it, or 
learned it. 
The subjective mark of memory. — Stop and perform 
an experiment. How do you know, without appealing 
to an objective record of any kind, what you were doing 
yesterday at this hour? “I was here, studying psy- 
chology,” you say. But how do you know? “ Why, the 
fire whistle blew,” etc. But perhaps you are imagining 
all this. What makes you so sure that it all happened 
yesterday ? 
Psychology is forced to conclude that what makes us 
sure of ourselves in such cases is the feeling of familiarity. 
In the figure (Fig. 25), E is any experience, such as yours 
yesterday at this time. £’ is a repetition, more or less
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
exact, of E. But £’ brings with it something additional 
to E, and that is F, the feeling of familiarity. This is the 
subjective sign that tells us we are really remembering. 
Fr 
Fic. 25.— E, any experience. £’, this experience repeated. F, the 
feeling of familiarity. 
This feeling of familiarity may be present in any degree, 
from the mildest flicker to the strongest flame. Titchener 
says that in experiments on the recognition of grays, he 
“has reported positively that a particular gray had been 
seen before, without being able to find anything whatso- 
ever, in the way of verbal idea or kinesthetic quiver or 
organic thrill, that might carry the meaning of familiarity ; 
the brain habit just touched off the report ‘ Yes,’ and that 
was all that could be said.”+ Such recognitions are 
characterized, not so much by the presence of a feeling of 
familiarity as by the absence of the feeling of strangeness, 
unfamiliarity, which we expect with experiences that are 
new. 
But even when the feeling of familiarity is strongly 
present, our memory may be false to the facts. Children, 
1A Beginner’s Psychology, p. 182.
-P-A-G-E-141
RECORDING AND REPRODUCING EXPERIENCE I41 
especially if led on by suggestions or swayed by interest, 
may be emphatic, erroneous, but perfectly sincere reporters 
of their past. 
There is no single memory center in the brain. — Memory 
is all too commonly thought of as a single faculty, or power, 
lodged in some particular lobe of the brain. But plasticity, 
in the sense of remembering power, seems to be found 
wherever mind is found. The brain does its bookkeeping, 
so to speak, right where the business is transacted: the 
part of the brain used in experiencing a thing is the part 
used in recording that experience. An injury which 
destroys the seeing centers of the brain destroys not only 
the power to see, but also the ability to remember how 
things looked. A man whose brain is injured or diseased 
may be unable to remember any previous experience of 
sounds, words, or even of nouns or verbs, while memory 
for all other matter remains intact. All depends on which 
part of the brain is affected. 
This fact, that we do not have in our heads one remember- 
ing machine which records all kinds of matter, but have 
many special memories in nerve centers or tracts scattered 
widely over the brain, is of weighty importance to the 
teacher: for as Kay says,! “A leading error that arises 
from regarding the memory as a single faculty is the belief 
that, in whatever direction we exercise it, we improve it 
as a whole.” 
But to exercise a part of our neurones will not improve 
all of them, any more than exercising one muscle will 
strengthen all the muscles. A certain mathematician was 
able to repeat over fifty figures in order after they had been 
1 Memory: What It Is and How To Improve It, p. 13.  
-P-A-G-E-142
  142 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
read off to him, yet could not give even ten letters which he 
had heard in the same way.. If, then, there is so much 
variation in memory power within a single sense, accord- 
ing to the kind of matter presented, we can hardly hope 
that improvement in eye memory will pass over to ear 
memory or touch memory or memory in any other sense. 
It is not surprising that one may have a good memory for 
names but a poor one for faces, or be able to describe the 
forms of objects while unable to recall their colors or vice 
versa. 
Something, of course, depends on what kinds of memory 
have been strengthened by practice; but still more de- 
pends on which brain fibers have been born strong and 
which weak. 
Essential processes of memory. — From what has been 
said, it is evident that four processes are involved in a 
complete act of memory. They are recording, retaining, 
recalling, and recognizing. If we wish to improve our own 
memories and those of our pupils, we can do nothing better 
than to study these processes thoroughly, especially the first. 
1. Efficient recording. —It is impossible to reproduce 
a moving picture well with the cinematograph, or sound 
successfully with the phonograph, unless a high grade 
film or record has been made. The brain, like these other 
machines, cannot reproduce what has never been recorded 
in it. If you would remember well, throw your whole 
soul into the making of clear, strong impressions. This 
is exactly what the uninterested, inattentive learner fails 
to do. 
We have found (Chapter V) that experience leaves its 
marks in the nervous system according to the laws of brain   
 
-P-A-G-E-143
RECORDING AND REPRODUCING EXPERIENCE 143 
set, mental set, intensity, frequency, and recency. As we 
should expect, these are the laws according to which we 
must imprint on the brain whatever we wish to recall. 
Brain set.— A brain is a complex machine composed 
of many centers, tracts, parts; and each part may be good 
or bad. Rarely do we find them all good. Now, all these 
varying parts, when united, make a recording mechanism 
which is pretty sure to work better on some material than 
on other. Hence there are large individual variations in 
power of memory. The musician may find it impossible 
to remember dates well, while the historian may fail to 
retain tones. Fortunately, our best memory seems in- 
variably to follow our strongest interest. We should try 
to discover this and cultivate it, even at the risk of weak- 
ness in other directions. In this way we shall succeed 
better, in the long run, than if we cultivate an all-inclusive, 
universal kind of memory. 
It is a curious fact that our brains can record matter 
more effectively when it is presented in rhythmic form. 
Often, when we cannot quite recall a word, especially a 
name, we can tell how many syllables it has, and where 
the accent falls. Several times, I have known the names 
of Julia Ward Howe and Harriet Beecher Stowe to be 
interchanged by scholars who certainly knew better. One 
reason for this is evidently the rhythmic similarity. 
But so many of our fundamental experiences come by 
pulses that we should almost expect the brain to work best 
by spurts. It is easier to learn poetry by heart, than prose. 
Your pupils can learn their addition tables more easily 
by saying “ three, five, eight,” “ five, six, eleven,” and so 
on, than they can if the “ swing ” is left out. This is one 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
      
   144 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
reason why children so easily fall into “ sing song,” and 
why we all tend to slide the accent on to a certain syllable 
in learning our declensions and conjugations. For the 
same reason, doggerel verse has been overdone as a means 
of committing to memory. Such an artificial device should 
be reserved as a last resort for very important pieces of 
knowledge which resist more direct attempts at learning. 
That old arithmetical memory gem which begins, “ Thirty 
days hath September,” is commendable doggerel. 
These riming aids to memory illustrate a further principle 
of brain set, that of unity. Our brains remember best that 
which is unified, organized into some kind of system, so all 
nervous and mental currents course in the same direction 
and reénforce each other, instead of being dissipated in 
devious ways. 
The best kind of system for one to use depends on how 
his brain naturally works best, and the purpose, permanent 
or transient, for which he is preparing. But since we are 
constantly trying to adjust ourselves with our environment, 
a thoughtful mind will do best, in the long swing, by think- 
ing things together in the mind as nature makes them work 
together in the environment. Lightning causes thunder, 
heat forms steam, and so on. The result is a thoughtful, 
logical system, a building every part of which supports all 
the rest, just such as we find in every science. 
Memorizing by wholes, when committing verbatim, 
probably owes its superiority over the “ part” method, 
to the same principle, that of unity. If we memorize|   1 See the Class Experiment at the close of this chapter, and G. F. Stout’ 
Groundwork of Psychology, p. 62; also the author’s Science and Art of Teach: 
ing, p. 96.
-P-A-G-E-145
  RECORDING AND REPRODUCING EXPERIENCE 145 
prose by paragraphs or poetry by stanzas, these parts re- 
main more fragmentary and less unified than if we commit 
by repeating the entire piece time after time until we have 
a good grasp of it as a whole. When this is accomplished, 
it is then best to take the tougher parts separately and 
master them one by one, by intensive, isolated repetition. 
Mental set. —In an office, much business is transacted 
that never goes on the books. That only is set down which 
is likely to be wanted for future use. Our minds seem to 
work similarly: much is experienced which, so far as we 
can discover, is never recorded. 
Further, this is true not of day dreams merely, which may 
flit through our minds and leave no trace: even serious 
matter, which costs a struggle to understand it, may not 
be registered unless we specifically direct our brains to 
set it down for future purposes. The student who has 
solved a problem, such as an original in geometry, but 
neglected to make special note of the chief points, the guide 
posts, in his solution, often finds that it costs him a severe 
effort to resolve his problem in the classroom. 
Whenever we approach any subject of interest, we are 
mentally set to perceive it, or remember it, or imagine about 
it (weave it into a story), or think it out, reason about it, 
or perhaps just to enjoy it, but seldom to do all these things. 
The child, in his naive way, wants to perceive and to enjoy. 
By and by, experience teaches him that it pays, some- 
times, deliberately to jot things down in his brain cells for 
future use. 
It is a matter of common observation, which more careful 
study would probably prove true, that we tend to specialize, 
either in memory at the expense of reasoning, or in reason- 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
146 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
ing at the expense of memory. If there is such a thing 
as a mind which can be both storehouse and factory, its 
kind is rare. 
Further, mental set has much to do with the time a record 
shall last. Commit for a day only, and memory tends to 
sink with the sun. ‘Stories and numbers were presented 
to groups of children. In one case the children were led 
to expect that their remembrance would be tested on the 
following day; in another case they were told that the 
test would be deferred for several weeks. In both cases 
the test was actually deferred for several weeks; and the 
results show that the material was much less completely 
remembered in the case where the learner expected that 
the test would take place in the near future.”! A dis- 
tinguished actor was asked, on a few hours’ notice, to take 
a new part. He soon worked it up, and gave it with pre- 
cision, but then immediately forgot it. Although he acted 
the part for several successive days, he found that he was 
compelled to relearn it, in some measure, for each day. 
Yet characters which he had mastered more slowly and 
thoughtfully he could play at any time without previous 
notice or preparation.” 
Carpenter (Mental Physiology, p. 444) gives a case of a 
minister, of sound mind and health, who preached the 
same sermon, accompanied by the same prayer and hymns, 
on two successive Sundays, to the same congregation. 
Yet on leaving the pulpit, he had no recollection whatever 
of having gone through with this very same service a week| 
before.

-P-A-G-E-147
  
RECORDING AND REPRODUCING EXPERIENCE 147 
The first question, when confronted with anything to 
memorize, is, For what, and for how long, do I want this? 
The teacher who has not mastered a subject, but has to 
relearn (not merely review) each lesson in order to teach 
it, is likely to keep up this wasteful practice year after 
year. 
Intensity. — This includes both interest and attention. 
A feeling of pleasurable interest is one of the strongest and 
most necessary factors in all learning. It seems to start 
a flood of nerve currents in the right direction. Other 
things being equal, the happiest learners learn fastest. 
We all tend to remember best what pleases us most. 
But if feeling becomes too strong, it may prevent the 
registering of impressions. A lady, on singing a certain 
hymn, could not recognize it as one which had been used 
at her brother’s funeral only a short time before, yet so it 
was. So, the stage-frightened speaker may be unable 
to tell, when he finishes, what he said on the platform. 
The fighter, when he recovers from his fighting rage, may 
be a poor witness as to what took place during the strug- 
gle. One trouble in such cases, however, is that the feeling 
is directed, not toward memorizing, but toward some- 
thing else. Hence it disturbs or prevents the recording 
process. 
Attention, as we have seen, means force and direction of 
consciousness. We must put in plenty of powder and 
shoot straight. There must be, then, first of all, the will 
to learn, closely related to mental set. If a learner remains 
mentally passive when a list of nonsense syllables is placed 
before him, he learns but little. And even if he actively 
attacks them, but with the purpose to observe, as how they 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
         148 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
are formed, and so on, rather than to remember, he may 
still see them many times without being able to recite the 
list.t 
Direction of consciousness, of all the controllable factors 
that make a good memory, is probably hardest to manage, 
but capable of most improvement. Direction includes 
concentration, the centering of the whole heart and soul 
on the matter in hand. Try to be deaf, blind, dead to all 
around you, to roommate or classmates, — unconscious 
even of where you are: Jive and be, for the time, the thing 
you are learning. 
With concentration comes discrimination. One should 
first center his attention on the task as a whole, make a 
kind of snapshot of it in bulk, get a general understanding 
of it, and then turn the focus of his consciousness from 
point to point as a panoramic camera sweeps from side to 
side, taking in a whole landscape bit by bit through its 
narrow but well focussed lens. Where this process goes, 
there follows memory. You remember best where you 
discriminate most accurately. 
Intensity takes time. — You must linger over what you 
wish to remember. The chemicals in the nerve cells are 
somewhat like those of a camera: they must be given time 
to work. Too short an exposure means a poor picture. 
A list of nonsense syllables can be memorized quicker by 
dwelling a little on each to drive it home, than by running 
over the list repeatedly at top speed. Here is one reason 
(but not the only one) why great scholars are so often 
slow readers, and why our frantic, eleventh hour cramming 
is likely to be of little avail. 
1 Ladd and Woodworth, Elements of Physiological Psychology, p. 582. 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  
RECORDING AND REPRODUCING EXPERIENCE 149 
Frequency. — As stated before, repetition reduces re- 
sistance in the nervous system. Of course, each repetition 
should be made as intense as possible. 
We must apply the law of frequency also in arranging 
study periods. Experiment proves that frequent, short 
periods of concentrated study are better than infrequent, 
long periods. Ten minutes each day will accomplish more 
than sixty minutes every six days. The figure (Fig. 26)

cording as the total time of 120 minutes is distributed in four different ways. 
Based on work of Starch. While this test was not strictly a memory exercise, 
it illustrates a general law of learning which of course holds true for memory. 
shows four rates of improvement due to four different 
ways of distributing study time. 
One reason why the long work period is less profitable 
is that fatigue soon sets in and diminishes the value of the 
latter part of the period. Another reason may be that 
interest flags, and is renewed with rest. Further, as we 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
       150 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
shall see, brain fibers develop and learning increases even 
during sleep. 
Just how short and frequent the study periods should 
be made probably depends on the age and ability of the 
pupil and the kind of material to be memorized. Very 
likely this will have to be worked out by experiment for 
various types of pupil and of lesson. But we can all safely 
make use of the general principle. 
In repeating and reviewing, use ideas as much as possible. 
That is, struggle to recall without re-perceiving what is 
to be learned. Such effort has an effect which may be 
compared to the developing and fixing process in photog- 
raphy. 
Recency. — We all know how our brain records fade 
with time, how we catch a last glance at the lesson to be 
recited, and rehearse our parts shortly before exhibition. 
How rapidly or slowly this fading goes on depends on how 
thoroughly the matter has been learned. 
2. Efficient retaining. — Where are ideas when they 
are not being remembered? Where are the moving pictures 
when they are not on the screen, or the tones of the phono- 
graph when the record lies in the cabinet? Between the 
recording of an experience and its reproduction, it ap- 
parently exists only as physiological traces in the brain 
cells. 
In popular speech, much is made of the subconscious, 
where our ideas, as ideas, as fragments of consciousness, 
are supposed to dwell when not in use. But the sub- 
conscious, so far as we can see, is nothing but brain 
structure and a certain kind of brain process. Of the 
many picture records on the film, only one at a time is     
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  
RECORDING AND REPRODUCING EXPERIENCE I5i 
projected; of the many sound records on the disk, but one 
at a time is intoned ; of the many idea records in the brain, 
but one at a time is “ played,” energized. Of course, we 
must not say that the brain works just like a phonograph 
or a cinematograph, but the similarity is close enough for 
illustrative purposes. 
Our first duty, then, is to keep the brain in fine physical 
condition, nourished by a strong, pure blood stream, rested 
by sleep, and toned up by recreation that really re-creates 
and does not burn out and exhaust. Wholesome brain 
exercise, too, is needed. Muscles improve with right use, 
and very likely neurones do, too. Everything we know 
about them would lead us to expect such improvement, 
both in their general condition, and also in an increasing 
fineness of fiber and nicety of connection with increasing 
discrimination and accuracy of reaction.1 
Such growth and improvement go on unconsciously. 
Owing to these progressive brain changes, you find that 
you can remember easily, in the morning, what you could 
barely rehearse the night before. But if, having memo- 
rized a lesson, you go on trying to stamp more records on 
the same neurones, your memory will be less effective. 
Two exposures of the same photographic plate may spoil 
both pictures. The learner should rest for a few minutes 
after each study period, or, if he is still fresh, turn to a 
different kind of learning and so use a new set of 
neurones. 
Finally, one should not disturb his brain records by 
worry, or by fear of forgetting. “Learn to trust the 
memory,” says Kay, “and, in order to trust it, strive to 
1 See Ladd and Woodworth, Elements of Physiological Psychology, p. 616. 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
   
     152 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
make it worthy to be trusted. It grows in trustworthiness 
by being trusted.” + 
3. Effective recalling. — In a business office, when we 
have made a good record of anything, our next concern 
is to file it so we can findit. This is true also in a business- 
like brain. When we forget, the brain record is not, as a 
tule, obliterated; but we cannot turn to it. We are like 
those fussy people who don’t know where they have put 
things. 
Let us notice that (practically) everything comes into 
the mind following something else, which has aroused it. 
So, August may be followed by Augustus Cesar, and this 
by Julius. The brain cells seem to empty their contents 
like the cartridges of a machine gun, each charge setting 
off the next. This gives another reason why it is better 
to memorize a piece by complete readings rather than by 
lines, paragraphs, or stanzas. The complete readings 
leave no breaks between records. 
Assuming that we have well-impressed records, the whole 
art of effective recall depends on getting the right records to- 
gether, so that each, when energized, will set off the next. 
Take a common case. Why does one tie a string on his 
finger to make him remember some commission he is 
charged with, such as a purchase? Because, first, by this 
unusual performance, the purchase is intensely impressed 
upon his mind and associated with the string. And 
secondly, since the hands (and so the string) are sure to be 
seen frequently, the string-record will not only rouse the 
purchase-record frequently, but will be very sure to start 
1 Op. cit. p. 323.    
 
-P-A-G-E-153
ce ee en eee 
RECORDING AND REPRODUCING EXPERIENCE 153 
the purchase-cell into action as one approaches the proper 
place for making the purchase. 
Let us refer again to our five familiar laws. 
Brain set.— This reveals two ways of organizing 
memory material, the naive and the reflective. The most 
naive way of all is to let events organize themselves as 
they occur, form whatever accidental associations they 
will. One stage of progress beyond this comes the arrange- 
ment of brain records in chronological order; in other 
words, recording and recalling everything in the order 
in. which it was experienced originally. He of naive, 
chronological memory is likely to unload upon you an 
endless cargo of details, telling everything “ just as it hap- 
pened.” Ask him a question that requires thought and 
you “ throw him off the track.” His brain record, like a 
phonograph record, must be played from start to finish. 
One who has an unusually strong verbatim memory 
often finds it an inconvenience to him. A well-known 
Englishman who could repeat a whole Act of Parliament, 
or other similar document, after a single reading, was 
heard to declare that this very power often gave him much 
trouble; for if he wanted to summon into mind any par- 
ticular point of what he had read, his only way to do it 
was to repeat to himself the whole piece from the beginning 
(like a child running up the multiplication table) until he 
reached the point desired. As one would expect, this 
gentleman could learn languages with unusual ease.' 
Reflective memory, called logical memory, is selective, 
a card-index kind of memory. Brain records are filed 
according to purpose, the purpose for which they are likely   1 See William B. Carpenter’s Mental Physiology, p. 451. 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
   
     154 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
to be used, in a definite system. For example: Edison 
says that his life has been free from temptation. The 
preacher notes that here is a man who is not tempted in 
the usual way; he will recall this when next he preaches 
about Temptation. The psychologist observes that here 
is an inhibition, by a great purpose, of all unworthy ideas: 
it will flash into his mind when he discusses the Psychology 
of the Moral Life. The vocational adviser sets it down in 
his mind as an example of the value of Finding the Right 
Vocation; it will serve as illustration in his next lecture 
on that subject. 
A very effective way of recalling what is forgotten is to 
charge your brain to reproduce it, and then go on, thinking 
no more about it. The lost item may pop into your mind 
sooner than it would had you kept goading your memory 
to find it. Such is the power of subconscious cerebration. 
Mental set. — We have many mental files, so to speak, 
and can turn to any one of them at will. We can set our- 
selves to recall the facts of any branch we have studied, 
shutting out the facts of other branches, as a musician sets 
himself to play in a certain key, forgetful of all other keys. 
Set yourself to recollect your childhood and you will 
resurrect much from the buried past. 
It is wise to maintain the same mental set in recording 
that is likely to be present when recalling. It is hard to 
give, in public, a speech memorized in private. Memorize 
in the presence of an imaginary audience. 
Intensity. — We are often exhorted to form as many 
associations as possible with that which we wish to re- 
member, and so make many brain paths to it. But these 
associations should be strong if they are to be useful.    
 
-P-A-G-E-155
RECORDING AND REPRODUCING EXPERIENCE 155 
One highway is worth many obscure and swampy roads. 
It aids both recording and recalling if we fix our attention 
on the most striking features of our memory task. The 
most striking features are those which we experience most 
intensely: the nose of one face fixes it for us, the eyes of 
another, the chin of another, and so on. 
Frequency. — The art of remembering is the art of 
thinking, says James. The merchant remembers prices, 
the athlete, scores and records, the chemist, formulas, 
because each thinks so often over his pet subject that he 
weaves his facts into a perfect tissue of strong associations. 
Recency. — Sometimes, the best cue for recall lies in 
repeating our recent train of associations, “ beginning over,” 
as the child does in reciting. So, one may often find a 
mislaid article by going to the place where he last remembers 
having it, and trying to repeat his course, following up 
the most likely suggestions. : 
4. Efficient recognizing. — If you meet a man on the 
street, you may know it is Davis, Jones, or Smith, yet not 
know which name to use. You have recorded his name, 
retained it, and recalled it, but fail to recognize which, 
among others, it is. Again, you may accord recognition 
to some name or other item as that which you wish to re- 
call when it really is not. Some of the reasons for faulty 
recognition appear below. 
False remembering. — So far, we have spoken of ideas 
as if they were rather mechanically recorded, and repro- 
duced without change. But ideas are not mummies: 
they may grow and change, like your old acquaintances, 
almost beyond recognition. Memory is seldom a clear- 
cut. record of the past, a photograph unfaded. Much is 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  156 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
lost, for it is impossible to cram the whole past into the 
present. Memory is more like those old manuscripts 
which, having been used over and over, show fragments 
and suggestions of the inscriptions made at various times. 
And in the case of memory, such a combination sometimes 
makes a record really false. 
Meumann ! gives various types of false memory, of which 
the following are most important: (1) There are holes, 
blank places, in our memory. (2) These blanks are filled 
by what is commonly true in such cases, or by what we judge 
must have been true. ‘‘ Rodenwaldt investigated the 
memories of a number of adults, employing as his material 
a picture of an infant in a cradle. The majority of his 
observers ‘ remembered’ that the color of the cradle was 
brown although it really was a conspicuous blue in the 
picture.” ? The cradles they had seen most were brown. 
(3) Ideas, especially similar ideas, such as similar pictures 
by two artists, fuse, grow together. (4) Our feelings 
cause certain ideas to stand out prominently, others to 
recede, so distorting the memory picture. As people proph- 
esy what they wish to come to pass, so they “ remember ”” 
what they wish had come to pass. 
Forgetting. — There is a theory to the effect that nothing 
once learned is ever entirely forgotten: apparent forgetting - 
‘is due to our inability to get at the right record in the brain. 
Fatigue often causes this. Cases are known where travelers, 
fatigued with the journey, have even “ forgotten ” a foreign 
language which they could speak well when fresh. Bota- 
nists, after a long tramp, sometimes find themselves unable

2 Meumann, op. cit., p. 8.
-P-A-G-E-157
  RECORDING AND REPRODUCING EXPERIENCE 157 
to recall the names of common plants. Teachers, when 
fatigued, may find it hard to call the names of their pupils 
for recitation. 
Certainly, our “ forgotten” knowledge leaves us with 
a brain different from one which has never learned. Brain 
traces remain which change the course of future nerve 
currents, influence our judgment, and help to direct our 
future feeling, the course of our “‘ common sense,” and our 
conduct. 
One of the most practical truths for the teacher is that 
(putting it roughly) learning lasts in proportion to its 
thoroughness. If a list of nonsense syllables is learned so 
that it can just be repeated once, it is about half forgotten 
within the first half hour; but if studied until two perfect 
recitations can be given, it is six days before the list is half 
unlearned. Retention is here measured by time saved 
in relearning. Material that has meaning is more easily 
learned and better retained than nonsense syllables. In 
either case, forgetting is more rapid at first, slower after- 
ward. It can be further slowed down by relearning — 
can be retarded, in fact, until it appears to cease altogether. 
In other words, one can learn and relearn matter so thor- 
oughly that, without further effort of any kind, it is his 
for life.

  CHAPTER X 
  ‘~, ANALYZING AND ASSOCIATING 
Exercise. — Turn to dictionary or encyclopedia and analyze the 
flags of several of the leading nations. Note forms, colors, symbols, 
relation of parts. Which of these forms, colors, etc., are found most 
frequently ? 
Now suppose that all the nations of the earth have united under 
one government. Mentally construct, and then draw and color, 
a flag or other symbol which you regard as suitable for this union. 
Give reasons for your choice of form, color, etc. 
We have studied how experience is gathered, recorded, 
and reproduced. Now, as in a factory, the raw material 
is often cut into parts, so our mental materials may be 
taken apart, analyzed; and as the factory fashions new 
forms, so the brain makes new combinations, synthesizes, 
associates. Let us study these processes of analyzing and 
associating. 
Adaptation to environment demands discrimination. — 
This world is full of things that are different from each other, 
and animals must act differently toward them or suffer 
serious consequences. The sheep that goes out in the 
springtime and eats green things indiscriminately, laurel 
leaves included, soon stops eating anything — at least till 
it recovers. Even the amceba extrudes the bit of stone 
which it happens to inclose, but hugs its morsel of vegetable 
matter. 
The world of the young child must be somewhat like 
that of one who is just recovering consciousness after a

blow or an anesthetic, ohh wales i in totally strange sur- 
roundings; or like the visual ‘ experience of one who has 
had “ drops ” in his eyes, or puts on glasses that blur every- 
thing. The stream of experience is one great drift of fog. 
But as the baby whacks his toes and his toys indiscrimi- 
nately, he feels a “shock of difference,” as James calls 
it. Tennyson, in his In Memoriam, has expressed very 
beautifully the infant’s gradual discrimination between the 
me and the not-me. 
“ The baby new to earth and sky, 
What time his tender palm is prest 
Against the circle of the breast, 
Has never thought that ‘ this is I:’ 
But as he grows he gathers much, 
And learns the use of ‘I,’ and ‘ me,’ 
And finds ‘I am not what I see, 
And other than the things I touch.’ ” 
These shocks of difference between various experiences 
become more numerous as he pursues his career of getting 
what he wants, until at last the world is found to be “ full 
of a number of things,” all of which must be treated dif- 
ferently if he would work his will on them: for example, 
he no longer puts everything into his mouth. And before 
many years, if offered his’ choice between a five-dollar 
gold piece and a new penny that looks much like it, he will 
discriminate nicely between them. 
Discrimination and analysis. — These two words are 
closely related in meaning. To discriminate is to experience 
la difference, as when we see a difference between checkers 
nd chess. To analyze anything is to discriminate (among)
-P-A-G-E-162
         m62°)/: PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
all its parts, as when we discover that a checkerboard is 
composed of sixty-four squares, half one color, half an- 
other; or take apart our idea of weather, or of man, to find 
what it necessarily contains. 
The relation of the parts is important, too. We must 
discriminate different orders of arrangement: The squares 
on the checkerboard must be arranged in a certain way, 
not any way. The letters a, ¢, and r may make art, rat, or 
tar. But this leads us from analysis into synthesis. 
Practical importance of discrimination and analysis. — 
Whether or not one discovers differences and acts on them 
is often a life-and-death matter. The electrician turns 
the wrong switch or touches the wrong wire; toadstools 
are gathered for mushrooms; the patient doses himself 
from the wrong bottle; shiploads of “ fool’s gold” are 
mined and sent across sea; the engineer fails to distinguish 
signals and his train is wrecked. 
Your pupils will long confuse fo, too, and two, yellow and 
orange, blue and green, the plus and times signs in arith- 
metic, certain notes of the scale, the words affect and 
effect, and a lengthy list of other similars. Every word 
misspelled or mispronounced, every problem mis-solved, 
every f written with its lower part twisted back into a j, 
every subject and verb unequally yoked together, suggests 
a neglect of discrimination and analysis. 
Children may speak of a “ violet man,” meaning a violent 
man, and of the “smell of violents,” or of ‘“ violence.” 
Merchandise becomes ‘“‘ merchant dyes,” or “ merchant 
dies.” A fourteen-year-old spoke repeatedly of a “ signal 
man,” meaning a single, unmarried man. A seven-year- 
old, on hearing some one say, “ Poison will paralyze,” re-

marked, “ That’s heaven.” Inquiry showed that he had 
failed to discriminate between paralyze and paradise. 
After I had demonstrated the Edlemann-Galton whistle 
before a psychology class, several students wrote ‘“ Alder- 
man Galton’s whistle.” I ought to have written the name 
on the board, at the same time calling their attention to 
the pronunciation. 
It is easy to find physicians who can administer medicine 
when the disease is recognized; but the power to diagnose 
a case, to analyze symptoms, and discover what disease 
actually is present —that is rare. So everywhere: the 
lawyer must analyze cases; the merchant, the wants of 
his customers; the farmer is learning to analyze his soils, 
his markets, and the requirements of various kinds of plant 
life. “I know a hawk from a handsaw,” says Hamlet. 
So Shakespeare reminds us that the power to discriminate 
common things is a frequent test of sanity and common 
sense. A 
Education is largely a process of learning to analyze 
'and discriminate. Every verb in the Turkish language 
is capable of taking twenty-five thousand different forms, 
and some other languages are almost as bad. All must be 
discriminated. Bacon’s essay on “ Gardens” mentions 
well toward a hundred different plants, classified according 
to the month in which they flower in England. And he 
was not primarily 4 botanist. How many colors there are 
depends on how well educated you are in color: some see 
four or five, some a hundred, and some see thousands. 
uThe law of analysis. —In the first place, notice that 
analysis and discrimination always go back to sensory dis- 
crimination, the shocks of difference we get as we use our
-P-A-G-E-164
  
164 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
sense organs on the outside world ; as when we discriminate 
between an impression of yellow and one of orange. In 
faces, trees, houses, forms of government, etc., we can 
usually discover some large bulk of difference. One house 
has a tower which the other lacks. But “in the last 
analysis,” we find that our power to analyze, to discover 
differences, goes back to sensory discrimination, our power 
to discriminate between impressions. The difference be- 
tween a red, white, and blue flag and a red, white, and green 
one of the same pattern, is just the difference between blue 
and green. Our pupils should have a wealth of practice 
in sensory discrimination. 
Now for the law: Whatever is analyzed out of a complex 
must be thrown up in relief. Some way must be provided 
to make it impress its separate pattern on the brain. We 
might almost state the law: Whatever is analyzed out of a 
complex must have been experienced alone. But nothing is 
ever experienced absolutely alone: there is always some- 
thing in the background. “ Alone ” would have to mean 
“apart from, or contrasted with, that which we are now 
trying to analyze it away from.” 
You could never find the face hidden in the tree of a 
puzzle picture if you had never seen a face apart from that 
picture. Such faces would have no meaning for you. 
“Sweet ” and “lemon” would not be analyzed from 
lemonade if the analyzer had not tasted them elsewhere, 
or in varying proportions. Notes cannot be recognized in 
a chord unless they have been heard out of the chord, or 
accented in the chord. Hear the violin alone, and then 
you can follow it when the full orchestra is playing. 
If you want your pupils to sing the alto and soprano  
-P-A-G-E-165
ANALYZING AND ASSOCIATING 165 
well in harmony, let them hear and sing these parts 
separately. 
When a complex, such as the taste of lemonade, or a 
chord of music, is experienced, a certain group of brain 
fibers is brought into play, as a unit. Now, let a part of the 
complex, such as the taste of lemon, or a single note, be 
separately sensed: almost certainly, a part only of the 
fibers previously used are thrilled this time, hence have 
been impressed more frequently, with a different mental 
set, and (since attention is centered on the isolated ex- 
perience) probably with greater intensity. Consequently, 
when the complex is again experienced, this part which 
has been isolated can again be isolated at will. The situa- 
tion is somewhat like learning to control a single finger, 
and later, to distinguish its action even when all the fingers 
are acting together. 
If we could watch the brain of one who keeps making 
discriminations, we should no doubt observe that it grew 
finer-grained, so to speak, as fibers that had formerly 
acted as a unit learned to function individually. The 
brain of the boor and the clodhopper never acquire this 
refinement of response even to ordinary and oft-repeated 
situations. 
Free images and free ideas. — If John Smith is found, 
from time to time, with many different groups of com- 
panions, we come to feel that he is free, and need not de- 
pend on any particular group to support his personality. 
So, if we analyze an image or an idea out of different groups 
of associates, it becomes free, and has a name and nature 
of its own, as does the image of red or the idea of liberty. 
Such free units are of great value, serving the purpose of 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
   
   166 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
portable blocks which can be used over and over in our 
mental structures. The loftier the intellect, the more use 
it is likely to make of such free ideas. 
But the average man does not ordinarily set himself to 
quarry out a stock of free ideas in any deliberate way. 
The process goes on almost accidentally. Let us see how 
a child gets his free image of red. He sees a red flower, a 
red book, a red sunset (see Fig. 27). At first he may re- 
gard the word red as the name of a flower; but as he finds 
this word passed around to 
books, sunsets, cheeks, and 
so on, both the color and 
the word that goes with it 
are at length “stamped ” 
into his brain cells and 
come to have an independ- 
ane ent, free existence of their 
own. 
Thinking, and so prog- 
ress, are often impeded by 
\reluctance or inability to 
/ separate ideas long tied to- 
gether, and so make free ideas of them. Many find it hard 
to separate the ideas of smoker, soldier, voter, from the idea 
of man, and attach them to the idea of woman. Wings 
and bird are so commonly tied that it is difficult for some 
to believe that a bat is not a bird. Certain students can 
hardly separate warmth and impurity when thinking of 
air. Metal and heaviness were assumed inseparable until 
a light metal was discovered. We should probably hasten 
our progress considerably if we would tear our old ideas Fic. 27. — Showing how the image of 
red becomes free. 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
ANALYZING AND ASSOCIATING 167 
well to pieces, mentally construct what we want, and then 
set to work to build it objectively. 
No one knows as yet, — and we can find out by trial 
only, — how early in a child’s life we should introduce regular 
exercises in discrimination and analysis, or how extensively 
they should be carried on, or the best practical use to make 
of the ideas that are set free. But there is good reason 
to believe that we are underworking in this direction. 
Here is a place where education can sharpen the wits much 
more effectively than ordinary contact with the environ- 
ment would whet them. [If all red objects were round and 
all round objects were red, it would never enter the head 
of any ordinary person that redness and roundness could 
be separated. Yet (as appears above) the commonplace 
environment leaves many ideas joined together which 
ought to be put asunder. 
Even in the kindergarten, we can place before the children 
objects which vary much in shape, size, color, material, 
use, and so on, and have our playful discriminators group 
and regroup them so as to make first one idea and then an- 
other stand out in relief. For example, let us first have 
all square objects piled together; then all red ones; all 
that are made of wood, or of cloth, or of metal; all that 
are good to eat, or that can be cut with a knife, or that 
will roll. As these successive experiences crisscross each 
other, they cut the unessential, accidental ties that have 
held ideas together in mental clumps, and leave them as 
free objects of attention, ready to combine in ways that 
are new, interesting, and useful.! 
The greater the variety and contrast among the different 
1 See p. 120 of C. Lloyd Morgan’s Psychology for Teachers.
-P-A-G-E-168
168 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
situations in which any experience appears, the sooner 
will it disengage itself and become free. If we teach the 
noun by calling attention to subject nouns only, the pupil 
may fail to analyze out the noun in a new position, as in 
the predicate. 
Culture of discrimination and analysis. — Two facts 
stand out here with great importance. 
The first is that discrimination (and hence some power 
\ pe analysis) can be cultivated. Classic cases are those of 
the blind Laura Bridgman, who recognized, by the “ feel ” 
of the hand, a person with whom she had shaken hands 
a year before; of the blind Julia Brace, whose sense of 
smell enabled her, it is said, to sort the clothing of the many 
inmates of the Hartford Asylum, as it came from the 
laundry ; of wine-tasters who can tell by taste alone which 
/ vineyard produced any choice wine, and in what year; and 
of the artists, dyers, and temperers of metals, who know 
when they have produced exactly the desired one of a 
whole range of a thousand colors. The psychological 
laboratory tells the same story: for example, the power to 
discriminate two compass points as two, when touched to 
the skin at successively decreasing distances, has been 
known to improve, in a few hours, to twice the original. 
‘Secondly: To cultivate analysis, cultivate attention. 
Many of our failures to discriminate go back to the blunder- 
ous teaching of our early days. Let a child be confused 
in his first sensations from an object and ambiguous in his 
first reactions toward it, and he may live on to the end of 
his days with the feeling that there is something hope- 
lessly uncanny and unmanageable about it. A brilliant 
teacher of my acquaintance, confronted by the problem
-P-A-G-E-169
ANALYZING AND ASSOCIATING 169 
of two feet and two overshoes to put on them, has for years 
picked up an overshoe, started to put it on the wrong foot, 
and then corrected the movement. 
Of course, native brain set for the task attempted is 
always necessary. The teacher referred to is ambidextrous, 
and may be so ambipedrous by birth as to sense less dif- 
ference between his two feet than most of us experience 
~with ours. We are all likely to remain poor discriminators 
in some department. One cannot tell the common colors 
apart; another can see no difference between similar 
sounds, or even words; perhaps we get “ mixed ”’ easily 
in names and faces. To some, all foreigners look alike; 
and it is said that old bachelors can see so little difference 
in babies that they would as soon have one as another. 
But pretty certainly most of our failures to discriminate 
result from our laziness or indifference. The achievements 
of the blind, so often exploited, can be duplicated by any 
one who will work with as patient and prolonged attention 
as the accomplished blind have given. Focus your con-| 
sciousness on point after point of any object, physical or! 
mental, and its constituent parts will stand out. Herein 
lies one great value of drawing, making, acting, translating, 
of all expressive work: success demands this very point- 
to-point concentration. 
Having considered the analysis of the contents of our 
minds, let us turn to their synthesis, to association. 
What is association? — Association is the grouping of 
our mental materials. If we use the term very broadly, 
it includes all possible combinations of mental elements. 
For example, when you perceive a rainbow, the perception 
consists of a number of impressions already grouped, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  170 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
associated. But they are grouped in your mind because 
their stimuli are grouped in the outside world. 
The word association applies more particularly to those 
collections or assemblages of mental material which did not 
enter the mind as such, but are grouped in the mind itself, 
by the brain itself, rather than by the arrangement of 
stimuli and the action of sense organs. Imagine a green 
moon in the sky. You never saw that: it is a brain-built 
association, composed of old materials, analyzed apart 
and then recombined. 
How associating goes on. — You can easily discover how 
the course of associations runs, by playing the part of psy-

chological spy at any conversation. You discover that 
“our experience lies in fields, more or less sharply separated, 
but often overlapping, or with the fences down, so we can 
ramble from one to another. So (as Fig. 28 shows), we 
may talk of early memories, including memories of books ; 
but ‘ books ” also lies in the field of favorite authors, which 
may suggest Shakespeare, and Shakespeare, perhaps, re- 
minds us of the theater, and so of the play to-night. So we 
start with the memory of our first day at school and end 
with the question of going to the theater to-night ! 
_ The law of association. — We often appear, as in the 
‘example above, to move our mental materials in bulk: we 
 
-P-A-G-E-171

mingle whole landscapes of perceptions and flying squadrons 
of ideas in a moment. But these complexes are made of 
mental elements, sensations, and affections, which, lying 
in two overlapping fields of experience, connect the two. 
So, when I was introduced to Mr. Marti, I remembered his 
name by thinking of smarty (though he is not one, by any 
means). How is this? ‘“ Marti” and “ marty ” are al- 
most identical in sound. “Smarty” is a familiar yet 
novel word, easy to recall, and by its 
parts which are common to the two 
fields of experience, it enables me to 
pass to the desired name. Similarly, 
a strawberry may remind one of MARTI 
other red things, as a sunset, this of MARTY 
a sunrise, and the sunrise of a boy 
getting up. A word often reminds Sa 
you of some riming word — you can Fic. 29. 
easily understand why. 
But why should a strawberry suggest a sunset rather 
than a red nose, or any of many other things?;) Those ele- 
ments are associated whose records lie along the line of least 
resistance in the brain, 
From the time of Aristotle, it has been customary to 
explain association as due to (1) similarity, (2) contrast, 
and (3) contiguity (that is, occurrence together) in time or 
space. So, a tall man reminds us (1) of another tall man, 
or (2) the opposite, a very short man, or (3) something 
which occurred at the time when, or in the place where, 
we experienced the tall man. These three laws have 
practical value in everyday life. For a discussion of them,

hensive law, see Titchener’s A Beginner’s Psychology, 
Gheval: 
(Two persons who look alike remind you of each other 
largely because they impress the same neighboring neurones. 
In one of my classes is a pair of twins so much alike that 
the only way I can tell Mary from Margaret is by dis- 
criminating their shades of hair, which differ slightly. 
Probably I shall never think of one without recalling the 
other also. 
Now, does the law stated above mean anything definite? 
Yes: for we do know something about the way records 
lie in the brain, and the probable paths of least resistance. 
Further, these paths are determined by the laws you al- 
ready know, which are here repeated. 
Laws of brain set, mental set, intensity, frequency, and 
recency. — Whether a record is made in any part of the 
“\\brain depends on (1) the neurones in that part, and (2) the 
force that acts on them. 
(1) The born poet has a brain of such constitution that 
it favors poetic associations. He is likely to form them in 
overplus abundance, sending them up the chimney with 
the smoke, as Tennyson did. A favorable mental set, 
such as the poet’s hour of inspiration, seems to charge these 
neurones and put them “ at attention,” so to speak, ready 
for a certain kind of action. 
(2) An impressing force of any kind may vary in intensity, 
frequency of impact, and the recency with which it has 
cleared the neural channels. The subjects about which the 
poet versifies are chosen for him by the comparative in- 
tensity, frequency, and recency of his various experiences. 
His life lies in his poetry voluntarily or non-voluntarily.

ANALYZING AND ASSOCIATING 173 
The course of our associations has well been likened to 
the spreading of a fire in a mass of fuel whose parts inflame 
with different degrees of difficulty! The brain with its 
graded resistances and preferred paths, is the fuel; the 
power of the associative flame is conditioned by the factors 
of intensity, frequency, and recency of the experiences now 
present. 
Value of association. — Association is the putting to- 
gether of our mental parts to make, at last, one whole mind. 
‘Without this process, a mind would be like a machine whose 
pieces are all present, perhaps, but not assembled in work- 
ing order. 
Consider the case of Jenny Morgan, a young woman who, 
blind from birth, received sight by an operation. Using 
the newly acquired sense of sight only, she could report 
correctly on the shape and color of any object, but could 
not say what the object actually was until she touched it. 
For example, if a pair of scissors was placed before her, she 
would describe, from sight alone, their shape, color, and 
metallic appearance; but she was unable to name them 
until she had touched them, when the wanting name would 
spring immediately to her lips and she would laugh at what 
she called her stupidity in not having recognized them 
before. But such an educative experience as this, that is, 
associating the familiar perception by touch, the new 
perception by sight, and the name of the object, left her 
able thereafter always to recognize the object without 
touching it.? 
The child, like many, adults, lives largely in one field of

experience at a time. Were it not for association, these 
separate fields would remain almost as unconnected as 
if they were registered in different brains. When Franklin 
\ first associated lightning and electricity, the wisest of his 
time could see no wisdom in such thinking. How often 
the learner fails to find any connection between his school- 
room knowledge and the life outside! In church, we may 
all accept and rejoice in important truths which seldom 
occur to us at any other time, and so are seldom applied. 
The student versed in psychology may so “ forget it 
all’? when he begins to teach that his psychology is never 
thought of as having anything to do with his schoolroom 
practice. 
One of the chief differences between the educated and 
( the uneducated is that he of disciplined intellect has learned 
‘to weave all his threads of knowledge into one systematic 
web. The world outside is of many parts, joined to make 
one: our many-parted mental world must be associated 
into a similar unity. 
Association gives meaning. — What does it mean to have 
«a meaning? To have a meaning is to have associations. 
When some one speaks to you in an unknown tongue, his 
words have “no meaning” because they arouse in your 
mind no associations, or next to none. The sounds of his 
words stand alone. Without associations, nothing would 
have a meaning. 
On the other hand, a familiar word, when pronounced to 
you, at once becomes a nucleus round which are grouped 
many images and perhaps affections. Like a person in a 
community, it has significance in proportion to the kind 
and number of associates it can attract.
-P-A-G-E-175
  ANALYZING AND ASSOCIATING 175 
Individual differences in association. — We observe in 
each other, and shall find among our pupils, great differ- 
ences in associative power. First, there is a difference in 
speed. In the Binet tests for intelligence (Stanford re- 
vision), one who is ten years of age mentally is expected 
to give sixty words in three minutes. Some subjects 
respond with a quick-flowing stream of many more than 
sixty, while the utterances of others are few and far be- 
tween. , But the very fastest associators are not nec- 
essarily the very brightest. 
/There is also a vast difference in range of association, one 
sticking to a narrow track of ideas, another rambling world 
wide, as appears so strikingly in conversation. Then there 
are the ight and the loose associators, or as we may call 
them, the realistic and the imaginative. Some of the first 
cannot bear to read a book of fiction, and object to fairy 
stories in home or school; for such stories are ‘ not real.” 
The second, the imaginative kind, may see all life as a fairy 
story with highly romantic possibilities shining out every- 
where. And if he can not make these things actually come 
to pass in the outside world, he can make them real enough 
to enjoy in the world of his mind, at least. 
| /Finally, associations differ greatly in value. A single 
¥dea that gives us control over some power of nature or 
human nature may be worth more than diamonds. In 
fact, ideas much resemble diamonds in that it is often 
difficult to tell the difference between the valuable and the 
valueless. It is especially hard for children to judge 
whether their ideas are worthy or worthless. Ordinarily, 
we must beware of inhibiting the flow, and tolerate abun- 
dance of whatever grade. 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  
176 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Subconscious cerebration. — Cerebration means action 
‘of the cerebrum. Subconscious means not-conscious-but- 
like-conscious. No one knows the precise difference be- 
\tween conscious cerebration and unconscious cerebration. 
The results are often much the same. 
Nearly every one knows of some case in which a problem 
has been solved, an invention made, or a piece of composition 
executed, during sleep, perhaps dreamless sleep. Also, 
many associations, once conscious but later forgotten, 
leave their records in the brain in such a way as to exercise 
a strong influence on conscious life. So, while it is well to 
be able to give “ a reason of the hope that is in you,” your 
hope may be well founded even when you can give no reason 
except “TI feel.” Herein lies the value of our forgotten 
knowledge: it is like the foundation of a building, unseen 
but supporting that which is visible. Here, too, is the basis 
of many preferences and prejudices. 
Subconscious cerebration explains, also, many ideas 
which arise in our minds, apparently unconnected with 
anything immediately preceding. Our brain currents 
seem to sink sometimes into the subconscious, like the 
rivers which pass underground, thence reappearing at a 
new point. t 
CLASS EXERCISE 
The purpose of the exercise is to study the process of analyzing 
mental material and associating ils parts in a new way. 
Let the instructor read a limited number (say three or four) se- 
lections from Asop’s Fables, Mother Goose, or other similar litera- 
ture. After the reading of a selection, each will record the characters 
that appear in it, and make a brief analysis of each one, noting his 
chief characteristics. 
   
-P-A-G-E-177
  ANALYZING AND ASSOCIATING 177 
Then make a new group of characters, selecting them from the list 
already formed. If the course of the story seems to demand it, new 
characters also may be introduced. Construct a new story of the 
same general kind as those read, permitting the characters to behave 
“just as they want to ” when they find themselves in each other’s 
company. It is not necessary that the story have a moral. 
This may be followed by discussion, including introspective ex- 
planations of how the various results came about. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. The definition, ‘‘ A point denotes position without length, 
breadth, or thickness,’’ was rendered by one child, after concert drill, 
“A point denotes a physician without strength, health, or sickness.” 
How can we secure discrimination even in concert work? 
2. Compare, as best you can, the dog, horse, and other animals 
with man, considering the following points: (1) sense organs, (2) per- 
ceptions, (3) memory, (4) mental analysis, mental synthesis. Simi- 
larly, compare children with adults. 
3. Marksmen are found to improve most rapidly when they are 
told where their missing shots strike. Why is this? 
4. Trace the relation of analysis to the laws of brain set, mental 
set, intensity, frequency, and recency. 
5. Tell what you would do to develop in a child’s mind a free 
idea of “square ”’; of “ value”; of “‘ good.” 
6. Mature students are sometimes found to make no distinction 
between “ perpendicular ” and “ vertical.”” Why do you think this 
is? How would you correct it? 
7. If you wished to make sure that a boy had discriminated care- 
fully all parts of a kite, should you prefer to have him look at a kite, 
draw a kite, or make and fly a kite? Why? 
8. What value is there in composition work, from the standpoint 
of discrimination and analysis ? 
9. A pupil insisted that in the sentence, “ Night Thoughts is a 
good book,” the verb should be plural. What was his trouble? 
to. Make a list of important discriminations in arithmetic, 
geography, spelling, language, or grammar.

11. What should you expect the word “case” to call up in the 
mind of a lawyer? of a physician? of a watchmaker? of a student in 
a co-educational school? Why? 
12. Show, by illustration, that the laws of similarity, contrast, and 
contiguity, all depend on the fact that there are identical elements 
which lie in two fields of experience and so enable us to pass from one 
to the other. 
13. In teaching Laura Bridgman (a blind deaf-mute), the first 
experiments ‘‘ were made by pasting upon several common articles, 
such as keys, spoons, knives, and the like, little paper labels on which 
the name of the article had been printed in raised letters.” Show 
the value of this. 
Would you advise pasting on articles their names in order to teach 
a child the words of his own or a foreign tongue? 
14. A sixth-grade boy, on being asked where one could find a 
rectangle, said “In the arithmetic.” When told to find one outside 
the arithmetic, he began to search among the clouds and trees, al- 
though he was sitting on a rectangular porch with his feet on a 
rectangular stone, near rectangular doors and windows. What was 
the matter? How would you teach him? 
15. Start a conversation with a friend (or friends). See if you can 
lead it from topic to topic by suggesting appropriate associations. 
Afterward, try to explain what happened. 
16. A bright high-school boy, with normal sense organs, was work- 
ing on a railroad section, on which, he had been told, no trains were 
running that day. As he was walking along the track, a locomotive 
ran up behind him and killed him. What directions (that is, what 
mental set) could have been given him that would have prevented 
this?

IMAGERY AND IMAGINING 
Exercise. — Print your name in capitals. Let the paper lie, but 
imagine you are holding it before a mirror, right side up. Locate 
mentally the reflection of the first letter of the name; of the last 
letter. In imagination, trace some (perhaps all) the letters, moving 
your hand if necessary Now, print on paper the reflection of your 
name, as you imagine it. Test your drawing by comparing it with 
the actual reflection in a mirror. 
Write an introspective account of what passed through your mind 
during the whole process. 
We have seen how experience is gathered, recorded and 
reproduced, analyzed, synthesized. In this chapter and 
the next, we shall study two especially interesting and 
valuable kinds of analyzing and synthesizing, the kind 
called Imagining, and the kind called Thinking. To 
understand these, we must know more of images and how 
they behave: therefore, Imagery first. 
From impression to image. — As Titchener points out,! 
“ there is no department of sense in which sensation stops 
entirely when its stimulus is removed.’ Sensation may 
persist as a “ positive after-image,” that is, a continuation 
of the original impression, as when a look at the sun leaves 
its orb “in your eye” for a time; or the persisting sensa- 
tion may take the form of a “ negative after-image,” as 
when a stare of fifteen seconds at red is followed by bluish 
green; or the stimulus may persist in the brain rather 
than in the sense organ, resulting in a “ memory after-

image,” such as some children have for several seconds 
when a word at which they have been looking hard, is 
suddenly erased from the blackboard, or when, after the 
teacher has ceased dictating a sentence, they still ‘ hear ” 
her voice and write accordingly. ‘‘ Recurrent images ” 
are such as those which, forming tunes, jingles, and the 
like, keep on recurring in spite of us, perhaps for a whole 
day. 
So we pass, by gradual steps, from the impression, which 
points us directly to the objective thing that started it, to 
the common type of image which composes our day dreams, 
and which seems to have been naturalized into purely 
subjective citizenship. 
Contrast of impression and image.— As an image is 
simply a revived impression, we should expect the original 
and its resurrected ghost to be as much alike as a sound 
and its echo. And so they are: These two forms of the 
same sensation are alike in quality: their chief difference 
is one of intensity. Because of this lack of intensity, an 
idea, which is composed of images, is less clear than a per- 
ception, which is composed of impressions. Observe that 
when an impression is produced, its brain tract is stimu- 
lated from without the brain; but when the corresponding 
image appears, the same brain tract (probably) is stimu- 
lated by a current usually weaker from a neighboring 
neurone. Let our images become sufficiently intense, as 
they sometimes do, and we mistake them for impressions: 
we “see” snakes, “ hear” our name called, or “ feel” a 
hand on our shoulder: we have hallucinations. 
Further, impressions are stable, constant, as stubborn 
as the external world which arouses them; but images

frequently flicker and die away just when we are most 
anxious for their radiant presence. You can test this by 
trying to multiply, mentally, two numbers of two or three 
figures each. Because our images refuse to “stay put,” 
the average person has to resort to maps, models, diagrams, 
and other objective aids. This explains the value of such 
apparatus in the schoolroom. 
Galton tells of a barbarous Eskimo who drew from 
memory a chart of the region over which he had at one time 
or another traveled in his canoe. It extended 1100 miles 
straight, or six times as far when indentations of the coast 
were counted. This chart was found to agree remarkably 
with the government map. Galton states that he has 
never known of any traveler, “ white or brown, civilized 
or uncivilized,” who could equal the feat. (See Inquiries 
into Human Faculty, article on Mental Imagery.) 
Chess players who carry on several games at once, blind- 
fold, have an intense and stable brain photograph of their 
various boards, and call to mind the picture of each, with 
the position of the men on it, whenever necessary. 
Kinds of image. — Since an image is the brain’s attempt 
to reproduce an impression, we should expect the kinds of 
image to be the same as the kinds of impression. And so, 
in general, they are, though in any individual mind, a given 
kind of image may be used so little as to make the owner 
declare it is wanting altogether. The images in which 
we teachers are most interested are the visual, auditory, 
and tactual-motor. 
We must remember, though, that a sense organ, — say 
the eye,— may be very keen and observant, without 
corresponding wealth and vividness of visual imagery

(Galton, Joc. cit.). And Stout states that “a special com- 
mand of certain kinds of imagery does not seem in general 
to be connected with any special fineness or vividness in 
the corresponding sensations [impressions].’’! 
The best way to study images is to experience and ob- 
serve them. Picture the following to yourself, conscien- 
tiously keeping your attention on each until it has time 
to grow as intense as your mind can make it. You may 
wish to keep an introspective record of your pictures, and 
to grade their intensity by at least three figures, indicating 
faint, moderate, strong.” 
A. Light and color.— An evenly clouded sky (omitting all land- 
scape), first bright, then gloomy. A thick surrounding haze, first 
white, then successively blue, yellow, green, and red. 
B. Sound.— The beat of rain against the window panes, the 
crack of a whip, a church bell, the hum of bees, the whistle of a 
railway train, the clinking of teaspoons and saucers, the slam of a 
door, a familiar melody played on a favorite instrument. 
C. Smells. —Tar, roses, an oil-lamp blown out, hay, violets, 
a fur coat, gas, tobacco. 
D. Tastes.— Salt, sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, a bitter dose of 
something, raisins, chocolate, currant jelly. 
E. Touches. — Velvet, silk, soap, gum, sand; dough, a crisp dead 
leaf, the prick of a pin. 
F. Tactual-motor experiences. — ‘‘ Feeling” your way through a 
dark room, winding a watch, passing from a walk to a run, writing, 
dancing, tying a tie, buttoning your coat, playing an instrument, 
swimming, holding a weight until fatigued. 
G. Other sensations.— Heat, hunger, cold, thirst, a headache, 
fever, drowsiness, a bad cold.

  IMAGERY AND IMAGINING 183 
What is the use of images? — Gulliver, in his travels, 
found a people who carried with them samples of what they 
conversed about, so they could point to each object as it 
came to mind. But we have learned to substitute ideas for 
objects. Each of us carries his world in his head. 
Your past experiences, as they come to you, have left 
their calling cards in the form of images. What is your 
past, as you recall it, but a panorama of ideas? The 
present world, distant lands, the solar system, vast astro- 
nomical spaces — these mean much to you and little to 
your dog because you have intense and stable imagery and 
he has not. Your future, for you, now, all the way from 
here to heaven, is simply a mental picture; inadequate as 
it may be, it is your only guide in preparing for that future. 
Here, again, you are much better off than your dog. 
Creative nature made a great step forward in passing from 
those animals which have little or no power of imagery 
to one whose whole mind is aglow with it. 
We have but one stock of images. — Whether we are 
remembering, or imagination is painting its strange, new 
pictures, or thought is copying reality, we are using the 
same old images in different combinations, somewhat as 
we use the same old twenty-six letters in different com- 
binations to write both good news and bad. The image of 
red is the image of red, whatever we do with it, just as 0 
is o whether in Jove or loathe. We may liken our stock of 
images to the musician’s hundred tones, combined and 
recombined into thousands of tunes; or to the men on 
the chess board, combined into endless fighting forma- 
tions. 
Evidently, if one’s stock of images is scanty, he lacks
-P-A-G-E-184

some of the counters necessary in playing the mental game. 
This is especially true of children. 
Types of imagery.— We can see a landscape or hear 
vocal music better than we can hear the landscape or see 
the music. Just as we succeed best by using different 
senses on different kinds of material, so we succeed best 
by using various sorts of imagery for various purposes. 
Geometry makes no noise: you cannot hear it, nor can you 
easily solve its problems in terms of auditory images. 
Here, visual imagery is serviceable, although Galton found 
that even geometers can get along very well with but little 
of it. Visual imagery has proved to be best in such feats 
as spelling words backward; and he who attempted to 
visualize all his music without even hearing the notes in 
his mental ear, would make a poor vocalist. 
Assuming that each imager has his own preferred type 
of imagery, which he uses whenever possible, the attempt 
has been made to classify all into four groups, visual, 
auditory, tactual-motor, and mixed. But careful investi- 
gation shows, first, that it is often hard to tell just which 
kind of imagery is being used, especially if the subject is 
one who has not learned to introspect well; and sec- 
ondly, that types of imager are much less clearly marked 
than had been supposed. However, two groups have 
been distinguished, (1) the versatile, and (2) the non- 
versatile. 
(1) The versatile imager uses all the common forms of 
imagery with ease, changing from one to another according 
to his purpose. So, Titchener tells us he lectures, now by 
1See The Diagnosis of Mental Imagery, by Mabel Ruth Fernald, 
Vol. XIV, No. 1, of the Psychological Monographs.
-P-A-G-E-185
IMAGERY AND IMAGINING 185 
visualizing his manuscript, now by following his own voice, 
which seems to sound ahead of him, now from kinesthetic 
images connected with the vocal organs, using all three 
guides, perhaps, in the course of an hour. 
(2) The non-versatile group are characterized by what 
they lack, rather than by what they have; for it seems 
safe to say that even among non-versatile imagers, the ma- 
jority have fair mastery of more than one kind of imagery, 
shifting according to the demands of the task. One may 
even perceive visually — say a page of music — but remem- 
ber it largely by tactual-motor imagery. And if he were a 
versatile imager he might then solve his musical problems, 
compose, perhaps, in auditory terms. So he uses different 
parts of his brain for different purposes. 
To sum up: each of us may be found to possess any 
kind of imagery, and in strength ranging from near zero 
to the vivid intensity that gives rise to hallucinations. 
For efficient mental work, it is probably best to use, in any 
task, that kind of imagery which, in the long run, forces 
itself to the front when we persistently set our minds on 
the achievement of that task. 
So we find, as in the oft-quoted case of the codperating 
play writers, Scribe and Legouvé, different workers doing 
the same kind of work with different kinds of imagery. 
Said Legouvé to Scribe, ‘“‘ When I write a scene, I hear 
and you see. At each phrase which I write, the voice of 
the person speaking strikes my ear. The diverse intona- 
tions of the actors sound under my pen as the words appear 
on my paper. As for you, who are the theater itself, your 
actors walk, they bestir themselves under your eyes. I 
am auditor, you are spectator.” “You are perfectly   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-186
       186 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
right,” said Scribe. ‘‘Do you know where I am when I 
write? In the middle of the stalls.” 
Individual peculiarities of imagery. — Galton,! the classic 
investigator of this interesting subject, showed the “ vast 
variety of mental constitution that exists in the world, and 
how impossible it is for one man to lay his mind strictly 
alongside that of another, except in the rare instances of 
close hereditary resemblance.”” So great were the differ- 
ences that some were “scandalized and almost angry ” 
at the “ heresy ” of others. 
Some of the most striking beukiartties were: the common 
absence of imagery —at least visual imagery, among 
scientists; great differences in vividness; the ability to 
visualize all round a solid by a kind of “ touch-sight ”’; 
or to see all the rooms of a house as if it were made of glass; 
color associations; visions; number-forms. 
Thus, letters may be ideated in color. One reports 
that he has always associated certain colors with certain 
letters, dnd cannot change the color of a letter, so to speak, 
by any effort. Further, such letter-color is always clear 
in hue and definite in outline. The word “ red,” strangely 
enough, takes on the color of light green. “ Yellow ” is 
light green in its first syllable and red in its second. So 
certainly do colors call up their corresponding letters that 
this person, when perplexed as to the spelling of a word, 
can decide the matter by recalling the color of the trouble- 
some word. 
Another striking case is that of a well-known authoress 
who, while somewhat “ fidgeted,” but not to the point of 
illness, saw the chief character of one of her books, in size 
1 See References at close of chapter.

like a large doll, enter her door, approach her closely, and 
then suddenly disappear. Many others hear voices or see 
visions. So common are these supposedly uncommon ex- 
periences as to lead Galton to comment on the frequency 
of the hallucinations of the insane among people of good 
health and social standing. 
Some of these peculiarities, especially the number forms, 
date back to early childhood. They take all kinds of 
fantastic shapes, one of which is here reproduced (Fig. 30).

and dales about the childhood home. Children who have 
fantastic imagery may refrain from talking about it be- 
cause of the fear of ridicule. They should know that their 
case is just uncommon enough to be interesting. 
From picture to symbol in imagery. — When primitive 
man wanted to make a record of events, he often did so by 
means of picture language. Our own alphabet was orig- 
inally a series of pictures. But the accumulation and repe- 
tition of such pictures is too burdensome to bear. Fond 
as you may be of your friend’s photograph, you would not 
attempt to reproduce it every time you refer to him: you 
prefer to write his name, using symbols which do not at all 
resemble him, but which mean him nevertheless. 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  188 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
As the race has passed from picture to symbol in its 
writing, so each developing mind passes from picture to 
symbols in some parts, at least, of its imagery. We may 
even distinguish a stage halfway between: when you 
draw a picture a thousand times, you may at length make 
it so carelessly, that it is rather a symbol than a picture; 
and so an idea repeated a thousand times may become so 
vague, distorted, fragmentary, as to be symbolic. Stout 
says that when he thinks of St. Paul’s there floats before 
his mind a vague picture of something cup-shaped, but 
states that if this cup-shaped mental picture could be made 
over into objective form so all could look at it, it might not 
make anybody else think of St. Paul’s. “I might have 
used the same image for representing a mosque in Constan- 
tinople, or even for representing Constantinople itself.” 1 
If you want examples of symbolic imagery, you can 
probably get them by observing what enters your mind 
at the call of each of the following: above; before; around; 
uf; why? how? progress; long, long ago; millions and 
millions; exalted; polygon. These words show the reasons 
why we are compelled to resort to symbols: we cannot well 
picture (z) individuals in a large collection, as 10,000 men; 
or (2) an abstraction, such as time, or folly, or polygon. 
As before indicated, Galton found that scientific men are 
weak in picture-imagery. He concluded that the use of 
very vivid pictorial images is unfavorable to the habits. 
demanded by abstract, verbal thinking, and that vigorous 
abstract thinkers are likely to lose the power of “ seeing 
the pictures.” The highest type of mind, he thought, does 
not wholly lose the picture-seeing faculty, but keeps it

only for those special cases that demand it. Yet those 
who cannot make use of pictorial mental imagery, have 
other ways of representing things to themselves, perhaps 
a kind of imagery whose units are muscular rather than 
visual, but which serves them so well that they are experts 
in expressing their experiences, either in words or by paint- 
ing. 
In teaching, the common danger is that we shall use too 
many symbolic images and too few of the picturesque, 
concrete kind. Pretty certainly it is the highest level of 
the brain that we are calling into play when we use ab- 
stract imagery, and our pupils may still be living on the 
second, that is the sensory, level. 
It takes them off their feet when (for example) we pass 
from arithmetic to algebra, and instead of multiplying a 
number of dollars by a number of days, multiply « by y; 
or when we speak of the flora and fauna of a country 
instead of its plants and animals. They feel that we are 
getting high flown and shooting over their heads. They 
“don’t understand it.” 
It is a good thing for us teachers to express in several 
varied forms that which we have to teach, taking pains 
to include many picturesque statements and many per- 
ceptive examples, that each pupil may embrace the truth 
in the dress that most appeals to him, somewhat as men of 
many countries all appreciate values best in terms of their 
own home coinage. 
What is imagination ? — Imagination, as the name im- 
plies, is an imaging process; but so, also, are memory and 
thought. And, as already stated, we have but one set 
of images with which to remember, imagine, and think — 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
   
   190 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
one set of counters with which to play three games. The 
difference is this: memory gives us the was-so; imagina- 
tion, the might-be-so; and thought, the must-be-so. 
There is a difference in the feeling that accompanies each. 
Memory, we found, carries with it a feeling of familiarity. 
Imagination is betokened by a feeling of newness, strange- 
ness; thought, by a feeling of reliability. 
Imagination, then, is analysis or association accompanied 
by a feeling of newness and strangeness. To remember is 
to retrace the old. To imagine is to explore the new. I 
remember the appearance of a horse and a cow; but if 
I combine the two into some sort of cow-horse or horse- 
cow, I am imagining. 
What is imagination good for? — We are wrong if we 
think imagination is found nowhere except on the back 
of Pegasus. It is not only desirable, but demanded, by 
the most prosaic act of the most humdrum existence, if we 
would perform it efficiently. Plowman, smith, penman, 
carpenter, ditch digger, tailor, architect, mason, musician — 
each is a better artist if he can form a clear idea, before he 
attempts his task, of how it should look or sound when it 
is finished. 
He, too, who would be served, must have some vision 
of the service he desires. It is imagination which pictures 
the various kinds of haircut, dinner suit, gown, house, that 
you might have, and the effect of each, enabling you to 
choose wisely. 
Combinations of colors that disagree to the fighting 
point, sickening mixtures of food, mismatched appoint- 
ments and events, the awkward, disgusting, and disorderly 
everywhere in human arrangements, are usually so much    
-P-A-G-E-191
IMAGERY AND IMAGINING Igr 
evidence of lack of imagination on the part of the plan- 
maker. Imagination is the father of order. 
Further, imagination precedes every carefully chosen 
word and every deliberate act. The fluent speaker seems 
to have a sort of moving-picture flight of ideas preceding 
the flow of his words and suggesting their choice. And the 
clearer the ideas, the more ready and apt the expression. 
One of the best ways to learn a new movement is by first 
picturing it with great clearness and then performing it. 
After much practice, the imagery which at first preceded 
the act, drops out, and the course of nerve action is direct 
from stimulus to performance. So, an expert, asked to 
tell how to perform a certain act, may be at a loss to do so, 
but will gladly ‘show you.” The imagery which once 
directed his movements is no longer present to suggest 
descriptive words. 
Only by imagination can you picture all your possible 
futures, so as to choose the best. The same power which 
saddens the dream of what might have been, gladdens the 
vision of what may yet be. 
Our pupils can make no rapid advancement unless they 
can see things, that is, imagine the next step of progress 
before they take it. In writing, they should be able to 
picture clearly the letter they are striving to maké. In 
larithmetic, perhaps the most frequent failure is the failure 
to imagine clearly the conditions of the problem. Subjects 
like history and geography are almost meaningless without 
this power of picturing. In the good-conduct class, it is 
seless to contrast the good way of life with the bad unless 
he pupil can send his mind ahead sufficiently to see to 
hat different ends the white way and the black one lead.     
       
    
   
    
           
   
-P-A-G-E-192
192 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Kinds of imagination. — We can easily distinguish two 
kinds of imagination, the imitative and the creative. 
Imitative imagination aims to copy something that al- 
ready exists either as object or process in the physical world 
or as idea in the mind of another. Creative imagination 
aims to produce something which, so far as the imaginer 
knows, never existed before. Imitative imagination finds 
its stimulus and its model outside itself, serves as inter- 
preter : for example, in reading, we try to rebuild, to imitate, 
in our own mind, the picture the author had in his. Creative 
imagination is originative, makes its own model, forms the 
first pattern idea for manifold imitation. Imitative imagi- 
nation adapts us to what is: creative imagination shows us 
how to change what is to what ought to be. 
Essentials of effective imagining. — First, here as every- 
where, stands purpose. The inventor succeeds by keeping 
his attention firmly on what he hopes to achieve, until 
means for its accomplishment suggest themselves. Th 
artist, waiting for his picture to shine out in his mind befor 
he can brush it on to the canvas; the poet, who feels hi 
poem as a whole before he can add line to line; the prophe 
or statesman, trying to make clear his vision of a futur 
state as a guide to the reforming of the present govern: 
ment, — all these feel themselves possessed of a purpose si 
strong that they sometimes believe they are directed b 
superhuman powers. 
There is danger that we shall dissipate our creativ 
energies on imitative imagination, as on too much fictio 
and too many moving pictures. These are good stimu 
lators, which should challenge us to pass on to productivi 
accomplishment of some kind.
-P-A-G-E-193
IMAGERY AND IMAGINING 193 
Secondly, abundant material is necessary. Even creative 
imagination can not work up a world out of nothing. Creat- 
ing or imitating, we can use only such images as we have; 
and we can get our free images in no other way than by 
abundant perceiving and careful analysis. We should 
take pains to gather material of the kind we are most likely 
to use. Scott, like so many others, took, as a basis for a 
projected work, some story already existing. To a friend 
whom he was visiting, he remarked, “‘ You have often given 
me materials for romance: now I want a good robber’s 
cave, and an old church of the right sort.” On finding a 
suitable cave, he made note even of the wild flowers that 
grew about it, explaining that an author who tried to 
furnish natural surroundings out of his mind, so to speak, 
would come to show in his descriptions a monotonous 
repetition instead of the endless variety and fine fitness that 
nature displays in her settings. 
Granted persistence in concentrating on any purpose 
until suggestions, associated ideas, begin to play freely 
about it, the next essential consists in selecting and reject- 
ing the ideas that apply for recognition. We must treat 
them as we do candidates for a position. Many, perhaps 
most of them, can be dismissed at once as obviously unfit. 
Others, especially the new and strange, should be passed 
from a casual to a careful examination. None must in- 
fluence us unduly because of previous acquaintance. And 
finally, if we would have the best service, the best must be 
chosen to serve. 
All we can do is to follow the lead of our best ideas, re- 
tracing if necessary, until we strike the path that leads to 
lour goal. 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  194 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
The schoolroom application is obvious. If we want a 
pupil to imagine well, say in connection with a composition, 
linguistic, musical, pictorial, or in handicraft, we must 
(x) see that he has a subject which fires him with purpose, 
must (2) furnish him plenty of mental material to make his 
imaginative pictures of, and (3) encourage him to be self- 
critical, to pick and choose among his eager ideas until only 
the best stand forth unified into a final product that is 
altogether good. 
Limitations of imagination. — One who has not learned 
the laws of mind is liable to suppose that imagination is 
like the genius of Aladdin’s lamp, capable of producing 
anything if only it is properly commanded. The teacher 
may assume that if he but does enough explaining, the 
imitative imagination of his pupil can follow anywhere. 
But the “ world ” which the child carries in his head is a 
small one, and he can no more imagine without images 
than he can build a brick wall without bricks. 
Nor does creative imagination possess the divine power 
of making a world out of nothing. The creative genius, 
when he is called a genius, usually points to the toil — 
terrible to one who does not love it, which lies back of his 
product. 
We must encourage the feeling of expectancy, for to 
expect the appearance of any mental product is to increas 
the chances of its appearing. But we should realize tha 
the mind cannot create new images nor new laws of com 
bination: it is limited to the old stock of materials and thi 
old ways of grouping them. The best we can do is to choos 
‘the finest ideas that present’ themselves as we persistentl 
follow the lead of an alluring purpose.

CLASS EXERCISE 
The purpose of the exercise is to find out how the mind works 
when trying to imagine (invent) a new game. 
To furnish an abundance of concrete material, the instructor may 
bring before the class several games which involve a variety of ap- 
paratus (say dominoes, euchre, a dice game, and checkers), and 
briefly describe the method of playing each. 
Let the class analyze each game, noting sizes, shapes, colors, spots, 
designs, etc., of the playing apparatus ; methods of dealing out, choos- 
ing, or placing, cards, counters, etc. ; and rules of procedure. 
Create a new game, involving (1) a new kind or combination of 
_ apparatus (such as triangular faced dice), or (2) a new method of 
starting (as allowing each to draw cards as he does dominoes), or 
(3) new rules for playing, or all of these. 
Introspective reports and discussion. 
‘FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. A dog, a schoolboy, and an old soldier, are all looking at their

CHAPTER XII 
THINKING 
Exercise. — (1) Remember some of the events of yesterday. 
(2) Imagine what you would like to put into an ideal day. (3) Think 
out some things which you feel sure will happen to-morrow. What 
differences do you find among these three kinds of mental activity? 
If one could remember and imagine, but could not think, how 
would he be likely to act? 
At the opening of the last chapter, it was stated that 
Imagining and Thinking are two especially valuable ways 
of analyzing and associating experience. We have studied 
the first. Thinking comes next. 
What is thinking ? — A young lady in a psychology class, 
performing an exercise in mental synthesis, placed a “ fair 
maiden ” up in a tree, which her lover, a shepherd swain, 
was unable to climb. But his trusty dog “ ran playfully 
up the tree” and frightened the maiden so that she fell 
on the soft and woolly backs of the assembled sheep! 
One can imagine this, but can hardly think it; for thinking 
is imagination regarded as truthful, and so believed. 
Truthful means “ picturing, or corresponding to, or har- 
monizing with, reality.” And reality is what actually 
was, is, or will be. However, we commonly extend the 
idea to what could or would be under certain conditions. 
“Tf wishes were horses, all beggars might ride.” Wishes 
  are not horses, and not.@ll beggars ride. Yet this is a true 
statement, harmonizitig with reality.

THINKING 199 
The world is covered with a network of roads, all of 
which lead somewhere; but one only, perhaps, will take 
me where I want to go. So, imagination is the great 
mental road-builder, filling our minds with a web of as- 
sociations which show how things might be; but one only, 
perhaps, of all these pictured possibilities, is true. To think 
is to select the mental road that leads to reality. 
One of the teachers of my childhood days mystified us by 
sticking a bit of paper on the nail of each of two fingers, 
one on each hand. She then caused these papers to dis- 
appear and reappear by throwing her hands back over her 
shoulders and calling, “ Fly away, Jack!” and ‘“ Come 
back, Jack!” We imagined (r) that she might stick these 
papers on her shoulders and then snatch them again; 
(2) that she held them in her hands and deftly placed 
them on her fingers at will; (3) that she left the papers in 
place, but showed different fingers at call. We finally 
found, by close watching, that this last guess was the true 
one, that it gave us what “really was so.” The most 
thoughtful scientist proceeds in a similar way to find the 
truth. 
The general, sitting at headquarters, gets news by tele- 
phone from all his fighting units at the front. On a map, 
he has a marker to represent each company. This he 
moves as the company advances or retreats, removing it 
if the company is captured or destroyed. Thinking is 
similar. The mind is the map; images are the markers; 
reality, especially the big objective world in which we live, 
is the actual battle field. Not that the mind is unreal: 
the map is just as real as the battle field. But the heart 
and soul of our effort is to represent correctly something 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
    
     200 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
real but not present and perceived. As we get news 
through our sense organs, we arrange our mental markers 
accordingly. Thinking is setting our images in order. 
In what order? In what we believe to be a truthful order, 
the order of reality. 
The belief which marks the truthful association and 
distinguishes it from the merely imaginative, is a feeling 
of reliability. You can imagine your favorite team winning 
the next game; but do you think it will? Would you rely 
on that outcome, back it up with action? Unfortunately, 
the feeling of reliability is often induced too easily, before 
all the possibilities have been thoroughly explored. “ Talk 
is cheap,” if we talk merely what might be, what we im- 
agine. But when some one challenges us, asking ‘‘ What 
will you bet?” he is getting a price on our talk, and so 
finding the measure of our feeling of reliability. 
Thinking is mental analysis or synthesis characterized 
by the feeling of reliability. 
The value of thinking.— The animal that has suc- 
ceeded best in his environment is man. The animal that 
thinks best is man. Thinking enables us to predict, to 
control, to succeed. 
Just how? If a traveler sees many roads before him, but 
has no idea as to which to follow, it is a mere accident if 
he takes the right one. So, if we could imagine numerous 
possibilities, but were thoughtless, had no feeling of re- 
liability in this direction or that, we might as well follow 
any whim or impulse, as thoughtless people do. But 
many of the so-called thoughtless are really imagination- 
less. They have few free images, and can not imagine 
any course of action clearly from beginning to end. Like    
 
-P-A-G-E-201
THINKING 201 
the lower animals, they follow the feeling of the moment. 
By careful thinking, we are enabled to deal with things 
absent as if they were here, with things past or future as 
if present, and with things involved and mysterious as if 
open and evident. For example, you may have a triangle 
here and now before you, and yet not know that the sum 
of its interior angles is 180 degrees, until you think the 
matter out. 
The perfect thinker would be one who had in his mind 
an image for everything in the universe, who could combine 
these images freely, and who always knew when his mental 
pattern was repeating that of reality. 
How thinking goes on. — A child, on scanning the sky 
some starry night, wonders why one star appears so much 
bigger and brighter than all the rest. He recalls a few 
other such giant stars. Perhaps they are older than the 
others, and so have grown bigger, as his big brother is 
older than he. But when he suggests this, people laugh: 
probably it is not true. Perhaps there are holes of different 
size cut through the sky. Then the moon must be a very 
big hole. But how could a hole look like a man, and how 
could it rise and set? Besides, he has heard some one say 
that the moon is really quite small, but looks large because 
it is so close. Headlights and lanterns look larger as they 
come closer. The big stars look big because they are closer. 
And the sun, being so very big and bright and hot, must be 
very close. 
What are the steps in this process? (1) A wonder- 
situation. The interrogation point is the thinker’s trade 
mark. (2) Imagination suggests one or more solutions 
which must make their way if they can, or (3) be inhibited, 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  202 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
overpowered, thrust aside by opposing ideas. So, the 
suggestion that stars are sky holes was inhibited by what 
was observed and reported of the moon. Among ideas, 
might makes right, and the fittest survive. (4) At length, 
an answer may arrive which seems to harmonize with every- 
thing the thinker knows. Belief follows — and relief, too, 
usually: his feeling of reliability is proportional to his 
success in securing harmony among his ideas. If there is 
something strong and positive to inhibit every doubt, he 
is sure. (5) This established truth becomes influential, 
in the community of ideas, in determining whether any 
new idea shall receive recognition. If stars look big be- 
cause they are near, no doubt the sun does, too. 
Naive and reflective thought.— Most children, and 
many grown people, think in the naive, uncritical, unre- 
flective way illustrated above. But suppose the child, 
in later life, becomes an astronomer. How now does he 
attack such a problem ? 
(x) He begins by stating his question with the greatest 
care. He does not assume that the big “ stars ” are stars 
at all, but keeps his mind open on that point. They may 
be moons. His problem is to find what makes the dif- 
ference between the larger and the lesser lights of starlike 
appearance. * 
(2) Experience has taught him that it is best to em- 
phasize facts first and theories afterward, and so avoid the 
danger of becoming biased, tied to this theory or prejudiced 
against that. As I have said elsewhere,! the common 
tendency is to jump at conclusions and dodge the facts, 
1In The Science and the Art of Teaching, Ch. XIV, on “The Lesson for 
Thought.’’ See also Chapters I and X of that book.
-P-A-G-E-203
THINKING 203 
whereas we must learn to jump at the facts and dodge con- 
clusions. Accordingly, our astronomer goes on observing. 
He notices, among other facts, that these larger lights do 
not twinkle as stars do, and that they wander slowly about 
among the fixed stars. 
(3) He is more persistent in imagining every possible 
theory and in subjecting each plausible solution to the 
most thorough tests. If these wanderers are larger merely 
because closer, then how explain the wandering, the lack 
of twinkle, and their peculiar color? 
(4) The solution which he feels forced to accept, which 
gives him the greatest feeling of reliability, is permitted 
only gradually to take standing as an established piece of 
knowledge. It is first a “ hypothesis,” a well-considered 
guess, then a “ theory,” and finally, if it can run the gant- 
let of a long array of critical fellow scientists, it becomes a 
scientific fixture, perhaps a “ principle ” or “ law.” 
No astronomer can now doubt that these wanderers 
are planets (from planes, wanderer), or that they move 
about the sun and shine by its reflected light, and so are 
more like moons than stars. 
(5) The critical thinker is more careful in drawing con- 
clusions from accepted knowledge. The child was right 
in thinking that the “ big stars ” look big because they are 
closer, but wrong in thinking that the sun, since it looks 
so very big, must be very close. 
Our greatest thinkers show wonderful application and 
persistence in seeking the right conclusion. Newton, 
when asked how he achieved his marvelous results, re- 
plied, ‘ By always thinking about them.” It is, told of 
him that he would pause in his dressing and sit for an

       204 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
hour with toilet incomplete, lost insome problem. Darwin 
used to sit, apparently staring at a flower bed but actually 
deep in thought, for hours at a stretch. 
How psychology passes into logic. — As appears above, 
the general course of critical, reflective thinking is the same, 
point for point, as that of naive, uncritical thought; but 
the critical thinker is more cautious, vigilant, thorough- 
going, and deliberate at every point than the child. He 
began as a naive thinker himself, and has gone wrong many 
times ; but he has noted the danger points and is determined 
not to be fooled again. 
The whole situation is like that of navigating diffi- 
cult seas, full of shoals, rocks, and quick currents. The 
untried sailor reaches port by luck, if at all. There are 
many wrecks. But gradually, lighthouses are built, 
buoys are placed, the seas are charted, the art of naviga- 
tion is perfected. Thenceforth, the expert sailor is practi- 
cally safe. 
The naive thinker is the unskilled mariner on the rocky 
sea of reality. There have been many blunderous wrecks. 
But gradually, the danger points have been marked, the 
course charted. The scientific art of thought-steering 
now makes the expert thinker reasonably safe. 
This scientific art is Logic. It is to be wished that every 
teacher could master it, especially its more practical side. 
But here we can only call attention to a few psychological 
essentials. 
Why naive thinking persists. — We teachers, anxious to 
reform the world, could do it if we could teach every one 
to think straight, and then to act as he thinks. Back of 
all bad conduct is a faulty idea of some sort. If we are to 
3 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
THINKING 205 
correct naive thinking, we should know what causes it, 
and remove the cause. 
Now, we have found that minds work, in general, accord- 
ing to a few familiar laws. Let us look to them for help. 
Brain set. — One disheartening difficulty is that so many 
imperfect brains are born into the world. Judging from 
the way many of them respond, or fail to respond, to their 
environment, certain neurones must be either lacking or 
not functioning. Inborn ability grades from idiocy and 
folly up to wisdom and genius. No teaching can correct 
hereditary brain weakness; but eugenics holds out a hope 
for brains better born. 
One great curse resulting from brain set is tradition. You 
can easily see how every one outside your own church is 
biased by it. Nor is it found in religion only: it sways 
society, keeps tyrannous governments alive, preserves ‘“‘red 
tape” even in a democracy, supports the quack, enslaves 
the farmer. Many farmers still watch the moon for signs 
to tell them when to plant beans and potatoes, kill pigs, 
set fence posts, etc. Cucumbers grow longest, they think, 
if planted on the longest day of the year! The weather 
on the second of February tells whether to sell or keep 
the hay, etc. Tradition inoculates the child as he comes 
from the cradle, and cramps and shackles his mind —a 
fate much worse than cramping and shackling his body. 
We must compel this muttering and jabbering in the 
dark to come out into the daylight and prove itself. Each 
must reform his own mind until he no longer fears to break 
a mirror or sit with twelve others at table. Then let us 
challenge tradition wherever we find it, and insist, so far 
as we can, that the minds of children shall be left free.

Mental set. — The chief danger here is from our feelings, 
which would lead us to take sides first and find the reasons 
afterward. But as a judge, watching two unknown parties 
contending, cares not which wins, but is determined on a 
fair trial, so every thinker should be unprejudiced as to 
the issue of his thought, but see to it that the contest is 
well conducted. 
Suggestions also work powerfully, even when self-ad- 
ministered. Sir Francis Galton cut out a comic picture 
from Puck, set it up, and made believe that it had divine 
powers. He soon began to feel that this ridiculous creature 
had considerable influence over him. 
This explains the halo of awfulness which some contrive 
to throw about themselves. We respond to these sugges- 
tions of superiority and permit such people to “ get away 
with it.” We should respect real ability, but assumption 
and pretension need treatment of some kind, perhaps by 
ridicule or a policy of non-intercourse. 
Ignorance is one very common cause of prejudice. The 
individual who is ignorant of anything, such as a proposed 
reform, is likely to feel ‘‘ cheap ” if not ready to act on it 
when others do, yet he runs a risk if he accepts the un- 
known; and further, because he is humiliated if found 
ignorant of a good thing, he is likely to pronounce the new 
thing bad. 
Intensity. — Unfortunately, events are so strung together 
in this world that we are often impressed with connections 
of no importance. It is said that war follows the appear- 
ance of the “ northern lights ” (aurora borealis). Probably 
it did once, and in a striking way; but one fact does not 
prove such a case, any more than one bird makes spring.  
-P-A-G-E-207
  THINKING 207 
Then there is often a Jack of intense, impressive facts 
to support the truth. This is why the expert thinker so 
often relies on experiment. The old-fashioned farmer, 
seeing the success of his scientific neighbor, begins to look 
with open eyes and mind on the “ new-fangled.” 
Further, even logical minds are in danger of being too 
much impressed by statements printed in colored ink or 
large type, or which are made with loud voice and em- 
phatic manner. The sunrise gun or the crow of a rooster 
may attract our attention more than the sunrise itself. 
Unfortunately, the less certain some men are of a state- 
ment, the more loudly they roar it abroad, as if to puff up 
their failing confidence with noise.* 
Frequency. — The liar, by repeating his tales, may 
arouse in himself the feeling of familiarity and come to 
believe his own yarns. Similarly, any statement, true or 
false, repeated many times without question, induces the 
feeling of reliability and comes to be “so” whether it is 
true or not. “TI believe... .” Write after these words 
anything you please that is not constantly refuted by your 
experience, say it over frequently and seriously, and you 
will probably wonder, in time, why any one should ever 
doubt it. “ There is luck in odd numbers!” Yes, half 
the time: for just half the numbers are odd. “ There is 
luck in even numbers,” and to the same degree. But this 
arouses less belief because we have heard it less often. 
1 The old doggerel gives popular expression to this psychological fact : 
“Tt isn’t always the wisest man 
Who has the most to say: 
The base drum makes the biggest noise, 
But is easiest to play.”
-P-A-G-E-208
  
208 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Here is one reason for the election cry, the motto, the 
slogan, the ceaseless repetition of certain advertisements. 
What everybody is saying, or what meets us at every angle, 
is likely to overpower us at length by its mental mass and 
momentum, to induce the feeling of reliability, and so to 
get itself established as true. 
Recency. — Every brain seems to have a little putty 
in it, and to hold best that which impressed it last. The 
last lawyer before the jury, the last debater to get the ear 
of the judges, the last salesman to appear before the pur- 
chasing committee, — in short, the one who, in any situa- 
tion, can get the last word before action, has an advantage. 
To some minds, the latest is the truest, and the most recent 
rumor arouses more belief than the most fixed and ancient 
facts. 
Essentials of good thinking. — As stated above, the 
perfect thinker would be one who (1) had images to represent 
everything in the universe, (2) who could form freely all 
probable combinations of these images, that is, imagine 
all possible or probable hypotheses, and (3) whose belief, 
or feeling of reliability, always clung finally to the correct 
hypothesis. 
Very likely this is an unattainable ideal; but it is worth 
while to struggle constantly for (1) ideas which are abundant 
and accurate, (2) freedom of imagination in combining 
and recombining our images, and (3) improved means of 
knowing when the truthful combination is found. 
Let us consider each of these. 
(x) Storing the mind with images and ideas. — We can 
secure an abundance of ideas by wide experience and care- 
ful observation, supplemented by penetrative conversation 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  THINKING 209 
and reading. Our minds are naturally hungry for ideas. 
We go eagerly to see moving pictures, and listen with 
pleasure to him who tells us of foreign lands. We can give 
accuracy and edge to our ideas by persistently trying them 
out on the stubborn world of fact, attempting to predict 
and to control, analyzing and re-synthesizing each until 
it just fits the fact it stands for. 
So the child is likely to regard poetry as “ stuff that 
rimes.’”’ Later, he finds that he must take down and re- 
build this idea, that there may even be poetry without 
time. Appendicitis was long called ‘‘bowel complaint,” 
or other similar name. The vague idea of ‘ something 
wrong among the intestines ” has now been rendered more 
exact by further information and careful discrimination. 
We may even find an idea with nothing corresponding to 
it. Such is the idea of phlogiston, a substance which, as 
the older chemists believed, flows out of a body when it 
burns. Further, two ideas, supposed to have no relation, 
may be found to refer to the same fact, as the English 
word horse and the Latin equus refer to the same animal. 
(2) Securing variety of hypotheses. — A fertile imagina- 
tion is one of the first requisites of successful thinking; for 
we cannot consider the ideas which never enter our heads. 
Nor is there any known way of going out and capturing 
the right hypothesis and compelling it to serve us. But 
lwe can and should steer away from the paths of prosy 
latitude and encourage our associations to loosen up and 
joggle themselves together in patterns that are new, even 
if bizarre and fantastic sometimes. Here is one of the 
erious uses of wit. 
These, however, are only our setting-up exercises. If       
   
    
    
    
   
-P-A-G-E-210
210 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
we are ready for the serious labor of truth-finding, we must 
work our way thoroughly through the whole list of facts. 
_ If any seem to be of key-importance, we can imagine them 
removed — what would happen? ‘Those that are minute 
can be magnified by the microscope of exaggeration, and 
the more bold and imposing ones looked at through a re- 
ducing glass. We can even import events: ‘ How would 
this situation be changed if so and so were brought to bear 
on it?” 
If now, all these devices are backed up by perfect fa- 
miliarity with the series of facts we are dealing with, we 
may hope to find our way into the room where sit the gold, 
silver, and iron chests, and make ready to choose the one 
that contains the treasure. 
(3) Recognizing the true hypothesis. — The critical 
and patient thinker is likely to accept, in the end, that 
solution which harmonizes best with all the knowledge 
he has. But as he runs through his stock of knowledge, 
he finds that its various items arouse different degrees of 
belief, strong or weak feelings of reliability, depending 
largely on how these items were acquired. Now, all our 
knowledge is gained in one of the four following ways: 
(x) Observation not followed by inference; as when a boy 
observes his mother doing housework, but makes no in- 
ference as to the order in which the work is done. 
(2) Observation followed by inference; as when the boy, 
having observed his mother for weeks, infers that she follows! 
a certain order, washing on Monday, ironing on Tuesday, 
etc. 
(3) Inference followed by observation; ‘“ Mother always 
bakes on Friday, so she will bake next Friday.” Friday  
-P-A-G-E-211
THINKING 2i1 
comes and observation proves the truth of the inference, 
strengthening the boy’s belief that he has found the order 
of his mother’s, housekeeping. 
(4) Inference not followed by observation; “ Mother must 
have gone through all this when I was a baby.” 
So, man observes his mother nature, the difference being 
that she cannot talk. The only way to question her is by 
experiment. We feel sure of what we observe, less sure of 
our inferences, reassured when inference is borne out by 
further observation, less secure when we extend an in- 
ference without being able to support it by direct obser- 
vation. But in the mind of the critical thinker, that 
hypothesis survives which appears to have the best founda- 
tion, directly or indirectly, in observed facts. 
Induction and deduction. — The basing of truth (1) di- 
rectly or (2) indirectly on observed facts, gives rise to two 
kinds of truth and two methods of getting at it. The two 
kinds of truth are the inductions and the deductions; the 
two methods are the inductive and the deductive. 
When a wonder comes, say as to whether one should eat 
heartily when he has a cold, there are two general ways of 
getting an answer. (1) We may fly straight for the facts, 
observe people with colds, some of whom eat heartily and 
others sparingly. We may even experiment on the matter. 
Or (2) we may think the thing out on the basis of what is 
regarded as already known, taking our stand on certain 
principles of physiology which appear to apply to the case, 
or even on such popular statements as “ Stuff a cold and 
starve a fever.” 
The first method is inductive, the second deductive. 
An induction, then, is a statement (usually a general state- 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  212 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
ment) based on observation of the facts. Suppose the 
wonder question is, Why do some “ stars ” twinkle while 
others do not? We observe the heavenly bodies at night 
and find that “ the planets do not twinkle.” They shine 
with steady glow. We examine the true stars: Star A 
twinkles, star B twinkles, star C twinkles, etc. If we find 
none that does not twinkle, we may venture. the inductive 
inference, “ All stars twinkle.” Now, we can observe all 
the important planets, but not all the stars: there are too 
many. And we must remember that every inference made 
without examining all the objects included, involves a 
risk. We can not well hunt the whole universe through ; 
consequently, after we have made our inference, exceptions 
may be found. This compels us to go on thinking, and so 
increasing in wisdom. Naive, reckless thinkers, especially 
children, are likely to rush into inference by the short cut 
of a few facts, forgetting that the longest way round is here 
the surest way home. 
Deduction is constructing the answer to a wonder ques- 
tion by using the knowledge we find in our mental factory 
and not collecting any new facts. Induction, as we have 
seen, must have fresh facts. Deduction is pure brain work, 
and can proceed (once the mind has gained some little 
capital stock of truth) without the exercise of the observing 
organs. Suppose the question arises as to whether women 
are more savage fighters than men. “ Yes,” some one 
answers, ‘‘ they are: for Kipling says ‘ the female of the 
species is more deadly than the male!’” Granted that 
“ deadly ” includes “savage in fight,” and that “ the 
species ” includes the human species, then the question is 
decided.
-P-A-G-E-213
  
THINKING 213 
But is it decided? No: it is simply referred to Kipling. 
And what right has he to make such a startling statement 
about females? None, unless (as the poem indicates) he 
has numerous observations (his own or others’) of facts 
to back him up. The point is this: truth always rests on 
observed facts — directly in case of induction and indi- 
rectly in case of deduction. Deduction, it appears, is 
simply an extension of induction, the erecting of an ad- 
ditional story over the inductive foundation; but the 
foundation of fact must always be there. 
Deduction, then, is not necessarily proceeding from a 
general statement to a particular fact, as itis so often 
said to be. It is simply the working over of old truth 
till we bring some new truth out of it. Every theorem in 
geometry is a general truth, yet nearly all are proved by 
deduction. 
The great danger in induction, as already stated, lies in 
passing to our general “ truth” too hastily ; the great danger 
in deduction consists in relying on some general “ truth” 
too carelessly. The world is overflowing with examples. 
Evidently, the most common trouble in thinking is with 
our general statements: particular facts in the outside 
world we can examine at our pleasure; but the proverbs, 
laws, principles which are urged upon us, and which may 
have their home chiefly in somebody’s brain cells, these we 
must always regard with caution. 
Judgment and reasoning. — The nice discrimination of 
the many technical terms used in what we may call pro- 
fessional thinking, we must leave to the study of Logic. 
But the words judgment and reasoning are in such common 
use that we should know their general meaning. 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
214 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Thinking is finding relations. Judgment _is the—direct 
discovery of a_relation. Reasoning is the indirect dis- 
covery « of a relation. “Our baseball team is better than 
the X team.” This is a direct comparison, a judgment. 
“We can beat the Y team, for X beat Y and we beat X.” 
Here is a more complex, indirect comparison, a sample of 
reasoning. Since two or more simple judgments are al- 
ways necessary, we may say reasoning is a (logical) com- 
bination of judgments. But whether the judgments are 
all true and all truthfully combined — “ there’s the rub.” 
Common sense. — As we found in studying memory, 
forgotten knowledge may have so set the brain as to in- 
fluence its future action. It is not surprising then, to find 
that many who have good common sense, or practical judg- 
ment, can not always give reasons for their decisions. Like 
certain good, old-fashioned cooks who are only embarrassed 
by measures and scales, they have “‘ learned by experience ” 
until they seem to be guided by “ intuition.” 
Subconscious cerebration has its value in thinking. Just 
as we often find it best to stop forcing our memory, and let 
it alone till it produces what we seek, so it is often best, 
having gathered the evidence in a case, to stop wrestling 
with the problem, and expectantly wait until the satisfy- 
ing decision, apparently of its own accord, issues in con- 
sciousness. 
Teaching children to think. — Children apparently do 
a great deal of their “ thinking ” subconsciously. At any 
rate, they have many wise intuitions for which they can 
not give the underlying reasons. We should not attempt 
to teach them the conscious science of thinking, but only 
the practical art, largely by practicing it with them in 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
  
THINKING 215 
conversational teaching, by bringing them into contact 
with good examples of it, and by showing them, from the 
daily affairs of life, how dangerous it is to take sides first 
and do our thinking afterwards. 
Probably the greatest thing we can teach them is the 
proper attitude toward truth. One must set his mind, not 
on having his own way, but the way of the facts. He must 
be prepared to accept the election returns, so to speak, 
whether he likes the elected candidate or not. 
The key to the right attitude is found by forming the 
habit of applying to every important statement these 
three test questions: 1. Just what does this mean? 2. Is 
it true? 3. How doI know? For example, what is the 
meaning of “ Stuff a cold and starve a fever”? Careful 
examination reveals that an “if ”’ is omitted. The mean- 
ing is, “‘ If one eats very heartily when he has a cold, he 
will bring on a fever that will require him to go on limited 
diet.” 
The questions, “ Is it true,” and “ How do I know,” re- 
quire that the pupil dig until he finds the foundation of 
fact for his statements. It makes little difference whether 
he digs inductively or deductively so long as he works in- 
telligently. 
The essential points are that he shall (1) see clearly the 
question at issue, (2) get an abundance of information 
about it, (3) let his imagination picture freely the various 
ways that might be so, and (4) finally follow the facts into 
the one way that is so. 
Individual variations in thought power. — We must be 
prepared for all kinds and grades of thinking among our 
pupils. No single test is sufficient to determine whether 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
   216 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
or not a child carries a good thinking machine in his head. 
There is a persistent but outworn belief that he who can 
think mathematics can think anything, and he who fails 
in mathematics can not think much of anything. But 
each has by birth a different brain set, an inborn tendency 
that turns him to one subject and averts him from others. 
Where we love, we think. 
But there are grades, degrees of thinking ability, too. 
Dr. Bonser, in testing 657 children in reasoning, found that 
go per cent of the pupils in the 6A grade were below the 
best pupils of the 4A, that 4 per cent of the 6A pupils were 
below the middle group of pupils in grade 4A, and that the 
score of the best of the 4A pupils was three times as high 
as that of the poorest pupils of 6A. The rate of progress 
varies just as much: some children can go several times as 
fast as others and at the same time do better work. And 
all this among children of the same class. 
In time, all schools, by their method of grading, will make 
allowance for these differences, and all teachers, in their 
methods of teaching, can do so immediately. 
CLASS EXPERIMENT 
Purpose. — To study induction and deduction. 
Materials. — A pack of ordinary playing cards. (Larger cards, 
suitably numbered or lettered, may be substituted if the playing 
cards are too small to be seen plainly.) 
Procedure. — The instructor may select the kings and queens and 
show them in pairs, as follows. (Let K equal king; Q, queen; H, 
hearts; D, diamonds; C, clubs; S, spades; +, with. KH-+Q4H, 
KD+QD, KC+0C, KS+OS. KH+QD, KD+QH, KC+0QS, 
KS+QC. A new order, or further complexity, may be introduced 
at pleasure. For example, there may be added to the above: 
    
-P-A-G-E-217
  THINKING 217 
KH+0C, KC+OH, KD+QS, KS+QD, etc. Orasimple problem 
may be solved first, a more complex one later. 
The students may be told, definitely, that their problem is to learn 
to predict the order in which the cards will be shown, or simply asked 
to observe what happens and report any notable discovery. Repeat 
the showing of the cards until the “law ” of their appearance is dis- 
covered by one, many, or all, as desired. 
Deduction may be practiced by showing any pair of cards in 
the series and asking which pair will follow. ‘Are you sure?” 
“Why?” 
Now show, with Q H, a card not used before, as an ace or the joker. 
“What will follow?” ‘ Are you as sure as before?” ‘‘ Why?” 
Introspection and discussion. What likeness and differences be- 
tween this situation and the working out of the key to nature’s mys- 
teries ? 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. What is the difference between thinking and daydreaming ? 
2. Suppose you believe fully that fire will not burn you: will 
your belief make any difference? Suppose you believe fully that 
although you have heretofore been afraid of dogs, you are going to be 
so no longer: will your belief make any difference? ‘In what kind of 
affairs is faith most valuable? : 
3. Give some celebrated examples of prediction or control due 
to thinking. What do you believe would have been the situation 
had the thinking not occurred ? 
4. Write out in some detail a case of your own thinking. Out- 
line the successive steps, or stages. 
5. State something that you “ know,” — something not too 
obvious. Introspect your feeling of certainty, and trace its source 
or sources. 
6. A movement has been started to have inventors work in groups. 
Do you think they are more or less likely to produce great results 
than if each worked alone? Why? 
7. Collect as many samples of naive thought as you can, es- 
pecially “‘ signs,” old sayings, and beliefs. Do you find any that seem 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  218 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
to be based on critical thought? Can you find in your experience 
anything that helps to explain the origin of belief in signs? 
8. “I know it is bad for me and still I do it.” What may be 
the trouble in a case like this? 
9. If one makes a statement with loud eloquence, with confident 
air, glowing eye, and emphatic gesture, and another quietly tells you 
the opposite, which are you more likely to believe? Why? Is his 
statement any more likely to be true? 
to. One student, on receiving a thought problem, sets to work 
with his pencil at once to answer it ; a second sits with eyes fixed for 
a time and then writes deliberately. Other things being equal, which 
answer do you expect to be better? Why? 
11. (A group may be assigned to work this out during a class 
period.) 
a. Observation: Toss a penny 100 times. How many heads? 
Tails? 
6. Inference: Try to state the “‘ law ” of its falling. 
c. Inference tested by observation: Forecast the result from 
tossing it 100 times more. Try it. 
d. Inference not followed by observation: If you could toss 
it a million times, how many heads? Tails? 
12. Tell the nature of each of the following statements (that is, 
whether it rests on observation only, or observation followed by in- 
ference, etc.), what degree of certainty attaches to each, and why: 
1. The moon sometimes shines at night. 2. The moon is much like 
the earth, but has practically no water, air, or life on it. 3. The 
almanac says the moon will rise at nine o’clock to-night ; we shall see. 
4. The inside of the moon is solid and cold. 
13. Give original examples of the four kinds of knowledge, viz. : 
a. Observation not followed by inference. 6. Observation followed 
by inference. c. Inference followed by observation. d. Inference 
not followed by observation. 
14. Illustrate induction: deduction. 
15. There are three fundamental reasons for faulty thinking: 
(1) lack of images (and ideas), failure to get the facts, ignorance, 
(2) lack of freedom in combining images so as to try out all probable
-P-A-G-E-219
  THINKING 219 
hypotheses, and (3) failure to detect and accept the true hypothesis. 
Which of these do you think is responsible for most errors? 
16. One who has known a few frivolous girls and a few brave men, 
states that “‘ Most girls are frivolous’ and “ All men are brave.” 
How does he violate his rights as a thinker ? 
17. Can youremember the future? the present? Can you imagine 
or think about things past? things present? things to come? 
18. Write on the topic, “‘ How I can teach my pupils to be critical 
(and not mere naive) thinkers.” 
19. Run through the various branches of study and discuss the 
amount and kind of thinking required by each. For example, what 
value has spelling as a thought study ? 
20. ‘ Where we love, we think.” Do you believe pupils do more 
thinking out of school or in? Along what lines? Why?

CHAPTER XIII 
AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCE: ‘‘THE FEELINGS” 
Exercise. — Look at the picture below. How does it make you 
feel? Report what comes into your mind as you gaze on it. 
We have finished our study of that kind of experience 
which is gathered from the outside world, and which, in the 
  Fic. 31. — What feeling does it give Pa 
form of memories, imaginings, and thoughts, helps us to deal 
with the environment, and to control or predict its operations. 
We turn now to that kind of experience which is not 
gathered from without — at least, not so directly. One 
person likes a picture which his neighbor dislikes: now, 
the two perceptions of the picture must be quite similar, 
220 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  
AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCE: “THE FEELINGS” 221 
but the two feelings that follow are opposite. We must 
look into this mystery of affective experience, the likes 
and the dislikes, joy and sorrow, grouchiness and amia- 
bility, attachment and aversion. 
The popular term is “ feeling,” or “ the feelings.” In 
place of these expressions, the psychologist prefers “ af- 
fective experience,’ or the “ affective complexes.” We 
can use the popular terms if we keep clear on the fact that 
a feeling, properly so called, is only one, a special kind, of 
“ the feelings.” 
Has affective experience much importance? — Yes: so 
much, in fact, that it fixes the value, for us, of everything 
else. Salt, flour, silver, gold, and all other “ goods,” have 
value because somebody finds them good, likes them, wants 
them, will give time and effort to get them. What nobody 
wants has no value. Take all feeling out of life and life 
itself would be worthless. 
As we should expect, then, affective experience is the 
great motivater, the great mover of man and beast. Jacob 
works seven years plus seven more for Rachel. See any 
creature persistently active and you may know that it 
persistently wants something. If nature would preserve 
her creatures, she must see to it that certain momentous 
ideas such as those of food-taking, love-making, and saving 
one’s self when in danger, are carried into action. Accord- 
ingly, she electrifies these ideas with a glow of feeling. Our 
feelings, then, stand between our sensations and our acts, 
determining which perception or idea shall be followed. 
Given a purely intellectual idea, pale and perfect, opposed 
by one that is uncouth but full of the red blood of emotion, 
and we can usually foretell which will get control of the

sinews of action. Even the intellect, the thinking process, 
is but the servant of the “ soul,” that is, the feelings. 
Review of sensation and affection.— As a means of 
understanding the affective complexes, let us review ele- 
ments. We have found (Chapter VI) that mind is com- 
posed of but two kinds of element, sensation and affection. 
Affection is the simplest bit of like or dislike, of agreeable- 
ness or disagreeableness, such as the like or dislike that 
accompanies a sensation, say that of a color, a tone, a 
taste. 
We may summarize our contrast of sensation and affec- 
tion as follows: 
Sensation Affection 
1. Referred to a particular 1. More of a general thrill. 
bodily organ, as color to the eye. 
2. Definite and clear under 2. Less clear. 
introspection. 
3. Follows its stimulus, pre- 3. Is aroused by sensation, 
cedes affection. and follows it. 
4. Stands for something not it- 4. No direct objective refer- 
self, usually something objective. ence. 
As we should expect, the affective complexes, that is, 
those mental states in which affection is most prominent, 
are more vague and fluid than sense complexes, such as 
perceptions and ideas. It is difficult to predict or control 
the feelings. We can often tell what thought a thinker 
will think next; but it is hard to say what feeling a feeler 
will feel next. 
Organic sensations and sense-feelings.— Here are 
further confusing currents to puzzle our analysis. In all 
our more stirring affective experience, such as strong fear
-P-A-G-E-223
AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCE: “THE FEELINGS” 223) 
or anger, there usually appear massive sensations, indefi- 
nitely localized, from the maintenance systems: the heart 
throbs, the breath catches, the whole inner body may beat 
and flutter and heave. 
Affections, uniting with organic and kinesthetic sensa- 
tions, form sense-feelings, as Titchener well calls them, 
which seem to be a kind of intermediate, half-breed class 
between sense complexes and affective complexes. It is 
his view that every stimulus, such as a tone, even, starts 
a considerable organic disturbance, and organic sensations, 
plus those of a kinesthetic kind, make up the body of a 
sense-feeling. He distinguishes six classes of sense-feelings, 
the agreeable and the disagreeable, the exciting and the 
subduing (calming), and the straining and the relaxing. 
The paired terms are opposites. 
Some of Titchener’s classified examples of sense-feelings 
are as follows: Tastes and smells are very agreeable or 
disagreeable ; deep tones are solemn, serious, and subduing, 
whereas high ones are cheerful, playful, and exciting; 
“ warm ”’ colors, such asred and yellow, are exciting ; “ cold ” 
blues, subduing. “If you follow the strokes of a slow- 
beating metronome you get an alternation of straining 
and relaxing.” ! 
Since it is in the affective complexes that both affections 
and sense-feelings appear in their greatest range of intensity 
and most tangled webs of combination, the feelings are the 
most complex of all human experience. Let us try to 
simplify them by stating their law: 
The law of the agreeable and the disagreeable. — We 
can not separate the objects and events of our environment 
1 Edward Bradford Titchener, A Beginner's Psychology, p. 81. 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
    
224 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
into the always-agreeable and the always-disagreeable. 
Probably nothing we can mention could be placed in either 
class. Darwin, recounting a South American trip, says: 
“We saw also a spectacle, which my guides viewed with 
high satisfaction; it was the skeleton of an Indian with 
the dried skin hanging on the bones, suspended to the 
branch of a tree.” Such a sight would seem to be always 
disagreeable if anything can be; but the Indian guides 
recognized the body as that of an enemy. 
Confluence of mental (and perhaps neural) currents is 
agreeable; diffluence, disagreeable. — That which appears 
to fulfill a person’s purpose, to get him what he wants, 
is pleasing; the opposite, displeasing. Observe at length 
what a man sincerely applauds, what he laughs at, what 
puts the glow of exultation in his eye, and you know your 
man, for you have learned the trend of his mind. “ Re- 
prove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, 
and he will love thee.” Grandparents abhor a racket, 
while grandchildren approve it. Their mental currents are 
flowing in opposite directions. 
As in the case of attention (see Ch. V), we must consider 
the force, as well as the direction, of consciousness. When 
mental energy runs high, all opposition may be swept away 
easily. When the dancing dervishes are roused to frenzy, 
pain only brings signs of elation. If the mental tide is at 
low ebb, as in extreme fatigue or old age, even “ the grass- 
hopper shall be a burden,” and no keen affective experience 
is possible. Peary states that, on reaching the north pole, 
the object of long years of desire, he experienced no tri- 
umphal emotion, but wanted chiefly to get home. 
In'making clear the course of one’s mental currents, and

hence what will please or displease him, our five familiar 
laws will help. But we can do little more at this point 
than to mention them. 
Brain set.— Most important here are instinct and 
temperament. As stated before, nature has cast a halo 
of feeling about certain types of behavior which are (or 
were) necessary to competitive survival and successful 
adaptation to environment. Examples are the tendency 
to find food, to fight, to ramble, to go in groups. Such 
types of behavior, with their accompanying consciousness, 
are called instincts. Now, instincts have inherited nerve 
paths, usually strongly marked. And although an in- 
stinct is commonly thought of as a racial trait, each of 
us is likely to have some instincts strong and others weak. 
If we know which instincts are strongest in any individual, 
whether he is first of all an eater, a fighter, a rambler, a 
lover, a property-getter, or what not, we know a great deal 
as to what his dominant feelings must be. 
Temperament also means much, and it, too, is a matter of 
hereditary brain set. Some are by birth morose and 
irascible, others cheerful and affable... When Sarah Pierr- 
pont was thirteen years old, Jonathan Edwards, whom she 
afterward married, wrote of her: “She is of a wonderful 
sweetness, calmness, and universal benevolence of mind. 
She will sometimes go about from place to place singing 
sweetly ; and seems to be always full of joy and pleasure ; 
and no one knows for what.” 
Mental ‘set.— Health is of high importance here. 
Whether we are sweet and smiling or sour and snarling 
1 Instinct is further discussed in Chapter XIV, Temperament in Chap- 
ter XV.
-P-A-G-E-226
  226 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
at any hour depends greatly on whether we have been 
eating, sleeping, breathing, exercising, working, and playing 
properly. The liver is well named; for it determines, in 
many cases, how we are living, so far as our feelings are 
concerned. 
The more purely mental side of “ mental set ” is found 
in present purpose. Such purpose determines very largely 
what we can brook and what we can not abide. Lovers, 
desirous of being alone, find the conversation of the group 
stale and unprofitable, perhaps even unbearable. He 
whose sincere purpose is to find the truth is unruffled when 
his argument fails, for he is attached, not to any particular 
argument, nor to victory in debate, but to what actually 
is so. Says Thomas Browne, in the Religio Medici, “I 
cannot fall out or contemn a man for an error, or conceive 
why a difference in Opinion should divide an affection 
[friendship]; for Controversies, Disputes, and Argumenta- 
tions, . . . if they meet with discreet and peaceable na- 
tures, do not infringe the Laws of Charity. In all disputes, 
so much as there is of passion, so much there is of nothing 
to the purpose; for then Reason, like a bad Hound, spends 
upon a false Scent, and forsakes the question first started.” 
Here is the test between the partisan and the truthseeker. 
In games, also, we can usually distinguish, by the feeling 
shown, between the true sport and the mere game-winner 
who feels that he must get the game by any means. 
Intensity. — The more intense the sensations, the more 
intense the affections that follow them. For this reason, a 
perception usually arouses more feeling than an idea. The 
object lesson strikes home. A shivering kitten on your door- 
step may affect you more than a hundred deaths in China.
-P-A-G-E-227
  AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCE: ‘‘THE FEELINGS” = 227 
Frequency. — Other things being equal, any stimulus 
arouses the feeling most frequently felt in connection with 
it. Consider your attitude toward the church, toward 
your family, friends, and foreign nations. Study your 
most repulsive branch when you are happiest and freshest, 
and you may grow to like it. 
Recency. — The recently experienced feeling is readily 
repeated. The mourning band reminds us that we must 
not speak of death, although when we are all some time 
removed from it, we joke about it freely. “I know how 
to sympathize with you,” we say to one found in the evil 
plight which we have just passed through. The channels 
are open for the former feeling, so that some measure of it, 
sufficient for sympathy, is quickly reinstated. 
Influence of affective experience on the body. — We 
have noted above the general effect of bodily conditions 
on the feelings. Now, what influence has feeling on the 
body ? 
1. Feeling sets the body to seek or shun. This may not 
always mean agitated action. The dog dozing off in the 
sunshine, the lady who, though in her parlor, is not “ at 
home ” to callers, the listener lost in the opera, all are 
seeking or shunning. The organism is bent on getting 
more of a given kind of experience or getting less of it. 
(rt) Sensations, that is, perception or idea, (2) feeling, 
(3) behavior; (z@) more perceptions or ideas resulting, 
(2a) more feelings, (3 @) more behavior: this is the un- 
ending spiral, enlarging as experience increases. 
2. Mild, agreeable feelings generally lead to the building up 
of the body. “ Mild” means calming and relaxing. (Re- 
call the sense-feelings listed above.) We are compelled
-P-A-G-E-228
228 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
to say “ generally,” for what with nature’s rough method 
of inducing her animals to seek or shun, and what with 
pathological human feelings, there may be many excep- 
tions. But it is true that mild and agreeable feelings tend 
to keep the body on a “ peace footing ”’ (see below), in a 
prosperous and constructive condition. Thus the wel- 
come sight, or even thought, of food, may start. the 
saliva and the gastric juice and keep them flowing for 
twenty minutes. 
3. All intense and all disagreeable feelings consume energy 
and set the body for action. In the great struggle for exist- 
ence, nature has used the more intense feelings, such as 
fear and rage, to set off the most violent seeking or shunning, 
as in the attack to kill or the flight for safety. All the 
constructive processes are at once inhibited or turned in 
the direction of immediate action. Digestion is stopped 
both as to secretion and movement of organs. The sugar 
stored in the liver is poured into the blood, the heart speeds 
up and strengthens its beat, the lungs quicken their action, 
the muscles respond more readily to stimuli, blood surges 
to the brain. The body is on a war basis, spending its 
stored energy. 
Professor Cannon likens the body, in peace and in stress, 
to a nation in peace and in war. In time of peace, both 
the body and the nation are built up and reserve forces 
accumulated; but in time of stress or war, all constructive 
activity must cease and all available energy must be poured 
out lavishly, perhaps even wastefully. ‘‘ One who permits 
fears, worries, and anxieties to disturb the digestive pro- 
cesses when there is nothing to be done, is evidently allow- 
ing the body to go on to what we may regard as a ‘ war
-P-A-G-E-229
  
AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCE: “THE FEELINGS” 229 
footing ’ when there is no ‘ war’ to be waged, no fighting 
or struggle to be engaged in.” ? 
The flutter and tremor that accompany all this, con- 
stitute a considerable part of the affective complex. 
General course of affective experience. — As we dis- 
covered (in the last chapter) how thought goes on, by 
analyzing a simple case of it, so let us try to learn the general 
course of affective experience by studying a naive sample. 
A baby sees a cat. Being naturally curious about living, 
moving creatures, he finds the sight agreeable. There is 
aroused in him a tendency to seek for more of this cat- 
experience. He creeps up and seizes the animal by the 
tail. The cat, finding it avails nothing to cling to the 
rug and pull, turns and scratches. Hereupon the baby 
cries and relaxes his grip on the tail. Pussy escapes. 
Next day, the child, having a cup of milk, hears the cat 
mew at the door, has an idea of the animal coming, sets 
down the cup and makes away. The cat eats the milk. 
In both cases, whether we look from the standpoint of 
the cat or of the child, three features stand out: 
1. An inciting perception or idea, agreeable or disa- 
greeable. 
2. A tendency to seek or shun. 
3. Success or failure in seeking or shunning. 
Romance and reflection. — This little story is really a 
romance, for the essence of romance lies in following feeling 
blindly, be the outcome what it will. The end is quite 
usually tragedy — or comedy. If there is luck it is ‘“‘ dumb 
luck.” All babies and many grown people are romantic. 
1 Walter B. Cannon, Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear, and Rage, 
p. 269.
-P-A-G-E-230
230 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
There is much the same difference between a naive and 
a reflective feeler as there is between a naive and a re- 
flective thinker. Here, again, the large steps in the process 
are the same, but the more stable and well-ordered mind 
takes each step less precipitately, with more circumspection. 
In the first place, the earnest soul does not go gawking 
and meandering through the world, waiting for inciting 
perceptions and ideas, but is seeking something, pursuing 
a purpose. Secondly, the tendency to seek or shun is 
held in leash until associated ideas are aroused, pro and 
con, and the probable outcome pictured. And thirdly, 
while the short-span mind may seem to succeed better in a 
short run, the long-span mind seeks and shuns more suc- 
cessfully in the long run. 
All feeling has to do with seeking or shunning. — Man 
is a born striver. When he no longer wants anything, it is 
time for him to die. In fact, he shuns death and other 
disagreeables for the very purpose of winning what he 
wants. 
All our music, painting, sculpture, architecture, litera- 
ture, pleases and inspires us by its presentation, or sug- 
gestion, of successful seeking or shunning. We hang 
pictures of good cheer on the walls of the dining room, 
where the tendency to eat is gratified. No one would hang 
in such a place the picture of a man perishing by drown- 
ing. And if we do sometimes contemplate the tragedy 
of the unsuccessful, as in the Laocoén group or the death 
of a hero, it is either because the characters are so far re- 
moved from us that we cease to sympathize and struggle 
with them, and so come to enjoy them somewhat as we 
enjoy eating an oyster; or because the picture of the  
-P-A-G-E-231
  AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCE: “‘THE FEELINGS” 231 
present partial defeat suggests a larger and more lasting 
victory. 
Kinds of affective complex. — Four kinds of affective 
complex are quite commonly distinguished, feeling, emotion, 
mood, and sentiment. 
A feeling is a like or dislike of moderate strength and 
complexity. A perception or an idea may start so much 
affection and sense-feeling as to be overflowed by it. Your 
pupils are studying a flag, either in its presence or from 
memory (that is, as perception or as idea), the number and 
arrangement of the stars and the stripes, the colors, and 
soon. Here is a sense complex. But now all repeat: 
“When freedom, from her mountain height, 
Unfurled her standard to the air, 
She tore the azure robe of night, 
And set the stars of glory there.” 
The arithmetic and geometry of the flag are forgotten. 
The perception or the idea has started a flow of affection. 
A feeling has come. 
Feeling and emotion are alike, and we cannot say just 
where one passes into the other. As a mountain is a great 
hill, so an emotion is a strong and complex feeling. Further, 
the emotion arouses a much stronger tendency to seek or 
avoid. Complete the recital of the poem, follow it with a 
patriotic speech and a flag raising, and all may be 
“ Ready to fight, ready to die, 
For Fatherland.” 
Mood is affective mental set; that is, mental set con- 
sidered with regard to affection rather than sensation. It 
may come as the after-effect of an emotion, as when one 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  232 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
who had been angry feels like “ slamming” something 
for a time; or may result from the summation of sundry 
agreeable or disagreeable little stimuli, as when a few 
compliments, coming in succession, charm one into his 
best mood for a whole day. 
Sentiment is a kind of feeling based on affective brain 
set. It is the most lasting of the affective complexes, be- 
ing, like moods, long-lived as compared with feelings and 
emotions, which are usually of shorter duration. If emo- 
tions are the high and foaming waves on the mental sea, 
sentiments are its slower-moving but powerful tides. 
Usually a sentiment results from long experience with the 
object of it. From long experience with the home and the 
saloon, we may form an attachment for one and an aversion 
toward the other. A sentiment is not so much a continu- 
ous thrill of feeling as a constant possibility of feeling. 
You love your home, but you never feel this love continu- 
ously throughout every hour of the day. 
Since these long-lived attachments and aversions have 
so much to do with shaping our fate, it is worth while to 
note that they are of two kinds, naive and reflective. The 
naive sentiment grows from long associations, but with- 
out serious reflection. An example is the patriotism of the 
peasant who loves his country simply because he happened 
to be born and brought up in it, or a swain’s love for his 
neighbor’s daughter because of propinquity merely. The 
reflective sentiment is thoughtful, exemplified in rational 
attachment to country, and the satisfaction of head as well 
as heart in choosing a mate. 
Control of feeling. — To control feeling, we must con- 
trol the amount and the direction of consciousness. Much 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCE: “THE FEELINGS” 233 
can be accomplished by securing favorable bodily con- 
ditions. Those who are given to passion can sometimes 
avoid it by working off excess energy in exercise. 
From our findings, there appear to be three points whereat 
we can apply control-power more directly: (1) the inciting 
sensations, (2) the tendency to seek or shun, and (3) the 
success or failure of the seeking or shunning. 
(1) In the case of children and weak adults, those in- 
citements to which we do not wish them to respond, as 
candy, alcohol, or lewd pictures, must not be perceived. 
And if we can keep the mind fully occupied with good, even 
ideas of an objectionable kind can not enter. 
(2) As one develops, he is no longer subject to whatever 
happens to appear in the environment. Power of control, 
and so the kingdom of happiness, lies within: by encourag- 
ing or suppressing the tendency to seek or to avoid, the 
feeling can be strangled at birth or fostered into maturity. 
(3) All our rewards and punishments are designed to 
make one line of conduct successful and another unsuc- 
cessful, and so to render the idea of such conduct disagree- 
able in the future, to make it arouse a tendency to avoid. 
A school in which a pupil can break rules continuously 
and successfully, should give a diploma for immorality. 
What would perfect feeling require ? — We wish to suc- 
ceed in our surroundings. Success depends on how we 
act. And how we act depends on how we feel toward the 
persons, objects, and events in our environment. What 
each of us should try to do, then, is to make clear his highest 
purpose in life, determine what things are necessary to its 
achievement, and cultivate attachments for these things. 
But perhaps there is an even larger view. In the last 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  234 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
chapter, it was stated that the perfect thinker would have 
an image for everything in the universe and would set his 
mind on the whole of things. Now, the noblest souls among 
us seem to set their hearts on the whole of things, their 
supreme seeking includes the race, humanity, the world, 
what one may call the will of the universe. “The great 
trouble with our feelings is their pettiness. We must stop 
worrying over the weeds in our garden and look away to 
the eternal hills, contemplate the good, the beautiful, the 
true. 
SUGGESTED CLASS EXERCISES 
1. Each member of the class may attend a moving-picture show 
and note especially (a) what in the picture aroused his feelings most, 
(6) how these feelings tended to express themselves, (c) expressions 
of feeling observed in the audience, (d) means used by the actors to 
suggest or express feeling, and (e) the successful or unsuccessful seek- 
ing or avoiding found in the plot. 
Report and discussion. 
2. The instructor may read passages from emotional literature 
of various kinds, the pathetic, funny, joyous, etc. 
Introspection and discussion. 
3. A skillful actor (perhaps a member of the class) may express 
various emotions by attitude and gesture, with or without words. 
Observation, introspection, and discussion. 
4. Pictures large enough to be seen well from any point in the 
classroom may be compared in pairs as the colors were in the class 
experiment at the close of Chapter VI. The subjects may include 
landscapes, live animals, human faces and figures, and various scenes 
from human life. (Large copies of celebrated pictures may be ob- 
tained cheaply from the Perry Pictures Company, Malden, Mass.) 
Pictures may be judged on the strength of their appeal to the feel- 
ings. Try to generalize with regard to the most popular and the least 
popular pictures.

Mind and behavior. — In Chapter I, it was stated that 
the subject matter of psychology consists of the thoughts 
and feelings which lie between what the world does to us, 
and what we do to the world, between stimuli and re- 
actions. Now, we have studied these “ thoughts and 
feelings,” all the elements and complexes which, so far as 
known, ever enter into the make-up of mind. Havy- 
ing learned how the brain gets its experience, records 
and reproduces it, analyzes and synthesizes it, we must 
now consider how all this experience is related to be- 
havior.

  240 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
The chief facts concerning consciousness and behavior. — 
Before proceeding to the special study of each kind of be- 
havior, let us consider some of the larger, general features 
of our outline. 
In the first place, observe that low-level behavior is fixed 
and mechanical, mid-level behavior partially fixed, and 
high-level. behavior not fixed at all. Observe also, in the 
“consciousness ”’ column, that the levels are marked by 
no (necessary) consciousness, by a feelingful consciousness, 
or by a thoughtful consciousness. The lower the level, the 
less complex the consciousness. 
Now appears, more prominently than before, the tre- 
mendous function of the feelings, the affective complexes, 
in the make-up of a personality. Mid-level behavior, our 
habitual and instinctive acts, is started by a feeling or an 
emotion; and the background for these is of course a 
mood. High-level behavior is effected or defeated accord- 
ing to the presence of sentiment, and especially the more 
rational type of sentiment. Whatever does not affect our 
feelings, then, will not influence our behavior. But what- 
ever we build into the brain in an affective way will come 
out as conduct. “Let me write the songs of a nation and 
I care not who makes its laws.” If we would educate for 
action, we must educate for appreciation. 
We find an inherited and an acquired type of both low- 
level and mid+level behavior, whereas the high-level action 
is wholly acquired. The only essential difference between 
the inborn and the acquired type is that the inherited form 
is more thoroughly fixed, less easily changed. 
Finally, all these sharp divisions which we have made 
for the sake of clearness, fade away in actual conduct: the
-P-A-G-E-241
EXPRESSING EXPERIENCE: TYPES OF BEHAVIOR 241 
nervous system has no partitions in it, and the different 
forms of behavior shade into each other gradually. Even 
the ideas of “inherited” and “ acquired,” “ fixed ” and 
“free,” can not be marked off from each other by a hair 
line. 
Having glanced at these outstanding features, let us look 
at each kind of behavior in more detail. 
Fixed, automatic behavior. — “ Automatic ” means self- 
operating: low-level behavior “ works itself”? without the 
necessity of conscious control. “ Fixed’ means that it 
can not be changed, or at least, not without great effort, 
if at all. Low-level behavior is almost as mechanical as 
the movements of a penny-in-the-slot machine. 
The reflec.— Inherited low-level behavior is called reflex. 
Examples are the movements of heart, lungs (in ordinary 
breathing), stomach and intestines, the change in size of 
the pupil of the eye under the influence of light, sneezing, 
the sucking and crying of the new-born child, and most 
of the simpler movements that express anger. A dog, 
after its cerebral hemispheres have been removed, ‘‘ by 
growling and biting when handled, has the appearance 
of being enraged; the decerebrate cat, when vigorously 
stimulated, retracts its lips and tongue, stares with dilated 
pupils, snarls and snaps its jaws.” ! 
It was not found possible to elicit from the animals any 
expression of joy or affection or fear or sexual feeling. 
Much of the emotion of anger probably boils up from these 
reflexes, as the sneeze-feeling comes from the sneeze reflex. 
Anger seems to be the lowest of the emotions so far as the 
nervous system is concerned, even if not morally.

With reflexes, the teacher has little to do except to teach 
her pupils how to avoid the conditions, such as worry and 
extreme fatigue, which interfere with the reflex processés 
of digestion and circulation. 
The sub-habit.— There is in common use no simple 
term by which to designate acquired low-level behavior. - 
Let us use for this purpose the name sub-habit, which will 
constantly remind us that such behavior is simply habit 
reduced by practice to the non-conscious, mechanical grade. 
Repetition reduces resistance, and in the ‘sub-habit has 
reduced it to the limit. Your fingers are almost as much 
a part of the mechanism as they are of you when you press 
the familiar keys of your long-practiced instrument. A 
fatigued soldier may ride, or even march, while sleeping. 
A shoemaker, subject to fits of unconsciousness, has been 
known to continue the boring movement in the midst of 
which the fit seized him, and twist the awl into his fingers.’ 
Notice that, although the low level of the nervous system 
can not take on the behavior of a higher level, the upper 
centers may by practice learn to respond sub-habitually. 
Carpenter gives a case of a tipsy woman playing the piano. 
She dozed off, but played perfectly until made to stop. 
She could be started again, almost as if she were a me- 
chanical player, by placing her hands on the keys. She 
would then begin a new piece, go to sleep, and play on.” 
Border-line behavior.— Let us remember again that 
there are no sharp separations between adjacent types of 
behavior. The mid-level is marked by consciousness, the 
low-level by none; but between the two are samples ac-

companied by unavoidable but apparently useless con- 
sciousness — useless, that is, so far as concerns the control 
of the act. Such are yawning, sneezing, starting at a 
bright light or a sudden sound, vomiting because of a * 
sickening taste or smell, gasping when we wade in for our 
first swim, and the like. In these we find our introduction 
to instinct. 
Samples of instinctive behavior. — Examples of instinct 
abound, especially among the lower animals. Your dog 
or cat, or the two together, will give you an exhibition of 
it any day. 
Birds and seals migrate thousands of miles at the call 
of the season, returning, in some cases at least, to the very 
spot from which they started. Ants and bees live in colonies 
where each plays his part with much more system and much 
less “ red tape ”’ than are found in most human communi- 
ties. Some of the ants are fed by slaves, without whose 
services they would die of starvation. 
The most significant facts about instinct. — Evidently, 
we are studying a very complex type of behavior, inex- 
haustible in its details. We shall get the clearest view of 
it by selecting a few salient features. Observe that both 
these terms, habit and instinct, are used variously, to refer 
(rt) to the behavior only, or (2) to the consciousness ac- 
companying such behavior, or (3) to both the consciousness 
and the behavior considered together. The third is the 
complete meaning. é 
1. What is instinct ?(_ Instinct is inherited mid-level 
behavior} that is, it is partially fixed, but can be changed 
with effort, especially in human beings; its nervous con- 
trol is in the lower brain centers; and it is presided over 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  
244 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
by a feelingful rather than thoughtful consciousness. It 
differs from habit in being inherited. 
a 2.(. Instinct is nature’s great life preserver, ) If any animal 
species is to live for long in theland, its members must not 
only (1) save themselves but also (2) serve the species, 
especially in the way of begetting and rearing offspring. 
Examine any instinct and you find all its energy urging in 
one of these directions. 
By tracing out the general trend of these two funda- 
mental instincts, that for food-getting and that for mating, 
we discover several minor, supplementary instincts. The 
competitive and fighting instincts impel to rivalry; the 
fear-and-flighi instinct preserves when one is overwhelmed 
by odds; the successful must usually hang together, hence 
the gregarious instinct; and they must follow their leaders 
in fight or flight, hence the instinct of imitation; the in- 
quisitive, exploring instinct keeps creatures in touch with 
their environment; the collecting and building instincts 
(witness chipmunk and beaver) provide food and shelter ; 
the parental instinct insures the care of the helpless young ; 
finally, the play instinct prepares these young for adult 
activity: the Indian boy attacks a nest of hornets to school 
him for war. 
——~ (They who lack the chief instincts of their species perish — 
without progeny: their kind is lost.) 
3.\ Instinctive behavior is the outward and visible ex- 
__-— pression of an inner nervous structure) We think it nothing 
strange when we push a button or a lever and start a ma- 
chine: the machine is “‘ ready made” to respond to just 
that form of stimulus. So, nature has wired us all up — 
or nerved us up, with graded resistance and preferred paths, 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  
EXPRESSING EXPERIENCE: TYPES OF BEHAVIOR 245 
ready for action when the right stimulus starts us. Not 
much repetition is needed to reduce resistance, for there is 
little resistance to be reduced. This enables us to under- 
stand why an animal, blindly following instinct, never- 
theless makes every move count as if toward a clearly 
conceived purpose. Yet a beaver, kept in a dry house, 
will construct a dam and a home, of furniture, broomsticks, 
paper, and so on, as seriously as if in his native waters. 
Birds, seized by the migratory instinct, sometimes make 
off and leave their young to starve in the nest. The in- 
stinctive nerve-machine has been started at the wrong time. 
Now we can also see clearly why such behavior need not 
be learned — though of course it may be improved with 
practice. Bird or beaver, reared in exile, with no possible 
memory of the parental abode, nevertheless builds, when 
the neurones have ripened to the proper point, the typical 
nest or dam. 
4. (Tnstinct generates akiianad In the last chapter, it 
was stated that nature has cast a glow of strong feeling 
about those acts most necessary to existence. We now 
find that these preservative acts are instinctive. Putting 
these two statements together, it appears, that{instincts 
, are emotional and emotions are instinctive) To say that 
one is instinctive and to say he is emotional come very 
near to saying the same thing twice. Both statements 
can be made of all beasts, and of many human beings. As 
men and women are expected to rule their instincts by 
reason, we can readily see why prigs pride themselves on 
showing no emotion, and why cultured people express it in 
a cultivated way. However, emotion may accompany 
rational action also. 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
    246 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
To the teacher, this connection of instinct and emotion 
is important because it shows him how to arouse the interest 
he is so anxious to secure. In physical culture, for ex- 
ample, free, instinctive play is crowding out much of the 
old formal gymnastics. The play is more interesting, and 
so, for the most part, more beneficial. 
the creature) /the more that creature can do when very 
young Vand the less it can learn afterward.) Young animals 
hatched from eggs are, in general, more completely out- 
fitted with instincts, and more fixedly subject to them, 
than those born of mammals. The human organism has 
been compared to an instrument with keys, such that a 
variety of music, anything within its range, can be played 
at the will of its operator; whereas an insect is like a barrel- 
organ which plays with invariable precision its little stock i

_-—— of tunes, but can play nothing else. (Yet instinct, even in 
an animal so low as the fish, can be trained, almost re- 
pressed. A pike, foiled by striking its nose against a glass 
partition whenever it attempts to capture small fish, will 
in time swim among them harmlessly, the partition having 
been removed. Man’s many instincts are comparatively 
loose, general tendencies, like the tendency of a vine to . 
climb upward, capable of training along many special 
lines. fy 
.. Nature of habit. —(Habit is acquired mid-level behavior. } 
\ Instinct is inherited.) It is in this point chiefly that they 
differ. Instinct comes to us ready-made from our ancestors. 
Habit is, or may be, made to order by each one of us. 
In general, then, we may think of a habit as a kind of 
special branch running off from the trunk line of some in-
-P-A-G-E-247
  EXPRESSING EXPERIENCE: TYPES OF BEHAVIOR 247 
stinct. In fact, it is often hard to tell where instinct ends 
and habit begins. It is instinctive to eat, habitual to eat 
three times a day; instinctive to play, but habitual to 
choose a favorite game; instinctive to use the vocal organs, 
\ bia to speak the mother tongue; instinctive to take 
what we want, habitual to take possession of it politely. 
It is no wonder, then, that in time of great stress, habit- 
paths are closed and the old, crude course of the instinct 
forced wide open: the instinctively excited individual may 
eat anything at any time, engage in rude horse play, yell 
instead of speaking articulately, or "grab what he can get, 
neighbors or no neighbors. 
All the larger truths we have discovered about instinct 
should be correspondingly true of habit. Instinct is na- 
ture’s life preserver; so are habits, if they are good ones, 
but the bad habits we form are life destroyers. Both 
instinct and habit have corresponding paths in the nervous 
system. Instinct is marked by emotions; habit, as a 
rule, by feelings. Both are partially fixed, and so, in large 
measure, educable. 
( Prevalence and persistence of habit.—If we flatter 
ourselves that all our acts are well thought out, it will be 
enlightening to list all we do for a day and check off the 
habitual behavior. We are, as James says, “ walking 
bundles of habit.” He asserts that at least ninety-nine 
hundredths of all we do from morning till night, even in- 
cluding our acts of politeness and most of our speech, are 
so deeply habitual as to be almost reflex in nature. 
And although habit is, in general, but partially fixed, the 
range of fixity runs all the way from the random looseness 
1 See Talks to Teachers, by William James, p. 65.
-P-A-G-E-248
  248 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
of what we may call occasional habits to those deeply in- 
grained performances which have become “ second nature,” 
or as the Duke of Wellington extravagantly said, “ ten 
times nature.” One poor victim of the drink habit ad- 
vertised the fact, in part as follows: ‘I am a person of 
intemperate habits and have no control of myself. I shall 
positively prosecute all persons who will furnish me with 
drink.” He called on his friends to stand by him, and to 
aid in the prosecutions. But a year or two later, he de- 
spaired of the fight and committed suicide. 
Habits are forming ceaselessly. — The nervous system 
is a recording angel with no power of forgiveness, save as 
we work out our own salvation. ‘“ Every act of the soul 
leaves as its enduring result an increased power to act, and 
a tendency to act again in like manner.” ! 
On this point, the words of James have become classic. 
“We are spinning our own fates, good or evil, and never 
to be undone. Every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice 
leaves its never-so-little scar. The drunken Rip Van 
Winkle, in Jefferson’s play, excuses himself for every fresh 
dereliction by saying, ‘I won’t count this time!’ Well, 
he may not count it, and a kind Heaven may not count 
it; but it is being counted none the less. Down among 
his nerve-cells and fibers the molecules are counting it, 
registering and storing it up to be used against him when 
the next temptation comes. Nothing we ever do is, in 
strict scientific literalness, wiped out.” ? 
The teaching of habit. — As the higher brain centers 
control the lower, or habit centers in one’s nervous system, 
1 Emerson E. White, School Management, p. 106. 
2 Talks to Teachers, p. 77. 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  EXPRESSING EXPERIENCE: TYPES OF BEHAVIOR 249 
so the teacher’s high-level neurones must in some measure 
control the pupil’s habit level of activity until his own su- 
perior centers develop. To some extent the teacher must 
determine which habits are good to form and which bad, 
and must help to break off the bad or guard against them, 
and build up the good. How can this be done? 
To begin with, no sensible person will take and pay for 
anything unless he is convinced that it is worth the price 
to him. The teacher can act as salesman, can convince 
the pupil that he will get full value for his time and effort, 
in speed, skill, accuracy, ease, and self-confidence if the 
habit is one of mechanical manipulation; or if it is of a 
moral nature, in self-control, self-respect, social standing, 
personal efficiency and progress toward some greater goal. 
Either in this educational selling talk or following it, 
we must bring out the essential features of the new habit 
in a way that is clear and striking. There is nothing better 
for the pupil; for what is well seen and loved is already 
half owned. Acquisition is most quick and active when the 
pupil “ catches on,” conceives a clear idea of the set of the 
skate, the twist of the wrist, the swing of the saw, or the 
mold of the mind necessary to success. If the performance 
is a very difficult one, or by its complexity demands diffused 
attention, we shall need to analyze it and master a part 
only at each effort. 
Further, the teacher can be a kind of detached conscience, 
starting the learner off promptly at practice time and coach- 
ing him according to the conditions of the day (weather, 
health, mental condition, etc.). Sometimes he will need 
a bracer in the form of good cheer or praise of his ac- 
complishments; and always, when he has “ struck it   
    
  
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  
250 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
right,” he will profit by the exhortation, “ Think how you 
did that. Do it again. Don’t let it get away from you.” 
Finally, it is no small service to keep the pupil’s atten- 
tion off his own mental state and other matters which should 
slide into the background of his mind, and to start him full 
tilt at the lesson itself, set wholly on turning out a piece 
of well-done work. 
Value of the various types of behavior. — As compared 
with free, high-level behavior, that which is partially or 
completely fixed has two advantages, its immediateness and 
its thoughtlessness. 
The situations which are best met by habit, instinct, 
sub-habit, and reflex, are largely those which require prompt 
response, as pulling away from a hot fire (reflex), pulling 
one’s foot out of the way when something is dropped (sub- 
habit), running out of danger (instinct), doing the fire drill 
when the alarm sounds (habit). The nervous grooves 
are well cut for such cases: they have to be; for thought 
requires time, and delay would mean damage, or even 
death. 
And secondly, having so much behavior stereotyped 
leaves consciousness free to attend to new business. Seated 
in the upper neurones, it can by a single command set into 
activity hundreds of subordinate nerve cells, as a com- 
mander-in-chief can keep an army moving, himself at ease 
and considering how the army shall move next. 
Deep thought is slow and ponderous. Thoughtful, 
volitional behavior is nature’s way of meeting new climactic 
situations which require our most carefully determined 
reaction. Of such a case, we are likely to feel that “ this 
is so sudden,” and to seek time to think it over. 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
EXPRESSING EXPERIENCE: TYPES OF BEHAVIOR 251 
High-level behavior.— Man’s nervous system has a 
third and higher story as compared with that of lower 
animals. This upper structure has no such strongly 
marked inborn paths as has the lower, but lies chaste and 
pathless, ready to be marked, grooved, educated by the 
environment. These high-arching neurones are the abode 
of our loftiest thoughts and finest sentiments, controllers 
of our most complex, long-span behavior. 
Yet there is nothing altogether new and different in 
this region of reason and “ free will.” Man is sometimes 
said to have reason and will in place of animal instinct and 
impulse ;! but it would be truer to say that, in addition 
to the animal equipment of instincts, he has also the in- 
stinct of sagacity, a natural outgrowth from competing 
and contradictory instincts. 
Take an example. A cat wants food that is guarded 
by a dog; the eating instinct and the fear instinct clash. 
She hesitates, advances, recedes, ‘ makes up her mind ” 
— that is, these opposing instincts make it up for her as 
they discharge their force, until she finally dashes one 
way or the other. 
Now, the human will works similarly, but of course 
much more complexly. The number and power of the 
mental forces in the conflict vary greatly, but might makes 
right among nerve currents as truly as between opposing 
currents of water. The more animal-like one is, the more 
is he determined by objects and events lying concretely 
1 An impulse is a fragmentary bit of instinct (or habit). By some, it 
is regarded as the original form of behavior, from which all other forms de- 
veloped. See especially Titchener’s account of it in A Text-Book of 
Psychology, pp. 450 ff. 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  252 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
in his immediate ‘presence. In the “ higher” individual, 
there are stored stimuli (so to speak) in the form of images, 
and the battle takes place in the brain, perhaps without 
any objective, dog-and-cat situation to energize it. 
Reason bears somewhat the same relation to the instincts 
that the federal government bears to the old colonial and 
state governments in United States history. These state 
governments still exist, and the states (that is, the people) 
furnish the power of the nation, give it impetus in its under- 
takings. But there is a unity not found before, resulting 
from the leveling and the common limitation of the inter- 
acting forces. A volition, an act of will, if it is anything 
more than instinctive stubbornness, is a kind of democratic 
vote of all the constituents of consciousness: the power of 
the minority is largely inhibited; the might of the majority 
goes into action. 
CLASS EXERCISES 
1. In order to study the forming (or breaking) of a habit, choose 
one or more such as the following, for practice: ventilating your room, 
breathing deeply, exercising an hour a day, eating slowly, standing 
or sitting properly, keeping your temper, reciting in good voice, 
enunciating clearly and vigorously, eliminating all eating between 
meals, going to sleep promptly. Other habits may be suggested or 
sanctioned by the instructor. Those are best which offer regular 
occasion for at least daily exercise. 
Keep a record of (a) opportunities, (b) successes, (c) failures; also, 
an introspective record of most significant facts, including helpful 
devices. 
The record for the class may be computed. Perhaps class dis- 
cussion will reveal rules for habit forming. 
2. Thoughtful determination of conduct. Let the instructor 
present the following, or an equivalent selection.

“A settlement was once besieged by a large body of Indians be- 
cause the chief thought that one of the white men had done him an 
injury, though he really had not done so. The chief sent word to the 
captain of the village that if the man was given up to him he would 
go away, but if not he would burn the village and kill the people. 
The captain and the people knew that if the Indians attacked them 
they would be very likely to capture the settlement, and at least, 
would kill a good many. They also knew that their fellow citizen 
was innocent and that to give him up meant torture and death for 
him. 
“What was the right thing for the captain of the village to do and 
why? 
“What would you have done if you had been captain?” 1 
Introspection and class discussion. 
3. Plan an experiment to discover how quickly a given group 
of pupils can learn a simple habit (act of skill). Get the average 
result, and also the kind and amount of individual variations found 
in the learning. 
Suggestions: Can you make use of the maze at the end of Chap- 
ter II or the figure at the end of Chapter IV? Should quickness of 
learning be measured by time, or by the number of repetitions nec- 
essary before the act can be performed without hesitation? Is it 
better to present the piece of learning without comment, or explain 
it as you would in teaching it to a class? How can we standardize 
the experiment so others can perform it after us if they wish to? 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Have you found anything in this chapter which helps you to 
explain how one can walk in his sleep? If so, what?

mitted to express themselves in the proper time and way)? Can 
you think of any which have become so useless that they should, if 
possible, be totally outrooted ?

beavers build dams? Can you see any evidence of a constructive 
instinct in children ?

time — say if dinner is not ready promptly? Why is this? 
to. See if you can justify nature’s wisdom in placing certain

to work well. -Why is this? Illustrate.

thought before action. Show why mid-level behavior would not| 
suffice.

INDIVIDUALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
Exercise. — Make a list of all the questions you would care to ask 
about a stranger in order to learn at least the main features of his 
personality. 
Suggestions: What points would you emphasize in setting forth 
the inner nature of one of your close friends? What would one need 
to know of Emerson in order to understand him as a person? Of 
Poe? Of General Grant? Examine one or more biographies and 
find what psychological points stand out most prominently. 
Try to convert your list of questions into an analytic outline of 
personality.    
    
               
       
   If we made a list of the traits in which people differ, it 
would include all the traits there are. It is only when we 
observe them superficially that they all look alike to us. 
As Thorndike says,! if we measured men’s heights with a 
scale which had nothing less than yards marked on it, 
nearly every one would be called two yards high. But put 
inches on the scale and there appear great differences as| 
expressed in this finer unit. “The same is true of every 
other trait. 
Our first effort, then, should be to get a general idea o 
personality, as we would get a general view of horse natur 
or dog nature, leaving minor differences out of the account. 
But if we expect ever to deal successfully with individuals. 
to manage children as a good organizer and leader manage: 
men, we must study how each varies from the commo: 
type, and what special treatment is necessary.

Let us look at the mind as a whole. — Psychology is the 
science of personality — mental personality. Consequently, 
when we have analyzed mind into parts, we are not satisfied 
merely to go on contemplating the parts. You learn much 
about your bicycle by taking it to pieces; but pieces are 
not a bicycle unless they go together and run together. 
He who would thoroughly know either a machine or a 
mind must watch it as it runs. In this chapter, then, we 
shall study minds as going-machines, as mental persons, 
and discover what we can to help us understand and appre- 
ciate them, compare them with each other, and estimate 
them at their true value as working forces in the world. 
Self is the key to other selves. — “‘ Know thyself ” was 
inscribed over the doors of certain Greek temples. It is 
written also over the entrance way to psychology. No one 
who is not well acquainted with himself can ever sympa- 
thetically know another. 
One who was familiar with the gold-bearing mountains 
of California noticed that the mountains of Australia had 
the same appearance. He reasoned by analogy that these 
latter mountains were probably gold-bearing, with the 
result that gold was discovered in Australia. 
We can not see our neighbor’s soul, any more than a 
prospector can look through a mountain and see the hidden 
gold: we know minds by analogy. Consider a case: 
your friend receives a letter, reads it, rolls a sparkling 
eye, smiles expansively. You understand that, for you 
Ihave been through something similar. We can state the 
analogy as a proportion: 
My body } _ f my con- } nt 7 friend’s body | , 
and behavior J * | sciousness and behavior ee
-P-A-G-E-258
  2 58 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Solving the proportion, X equals “a consciousness as much 
like mine as my friend’s body and behavior are like mine.” 
But if your friend acts strangely, that is, as you have 
never acted, you fail to understand him. The thoroughly 
vicious can not believe any one is virtuous; the politician 
does not know a real statesman when he sees one, but looks 
for a little deeper game than usual. We are often told not 
‘to judge others by ourselves: but those who give this 
advice could not heed it constantly if they tried. 
It follows (though we may not like to admit it) that no 
one can thoroughly understand a personality greater, or 
otherwise very different from, his own. The master may 
know the dog, but not the dog the master. Only another 
Lincoln can know Lincoln. To appreciate the great is to 
prove yourself great. 
/\\ Individual differences. — The experienced teacher does 
' not need to be told that children differ in learning power 
or power of self-control. She can easily appreciate Thorn- 
dike’s statement that among a thousand ten-year-olds| 
taken at random, we shall find some four times as strong 
- as others in a given trait, such as honesty, energy, industry, 
sympathy, or ability to learn atithmetic. Investigatio 
shows that among children of the same age and sub 
stantially the same advantages both as to home and school 
some can do six times as much as others in the same time. 
or do the same amount of work with only one tenth th 
number of errors.! 2 
As we can not here consider all the trait-differences foun 
among persons, let us observe some of the larger and mor 
important ones.

Short-span and long-span minds. — Perhaps the one 
best measure of a mind is the distance it reaches effectively 
into the future. Here, all lesser minds leave off — cats, 
infants, and fools see no to-morrow ahead of them — and 
the greater mind, with its vision, begins. Things distant 
in space may never come to trouble us; but dime flies, and 
the future always flies our way. We reveal ourselves by 
our degree of readiness for it when it arrives. 
The worthless tramp looks only from meal to meal. 
Business men tell us that ninety-eight per cent of the people 
of the United States are dependent on the daily wage, and 
the majority of these would soon be thrown into dire dis- 
tress if the wages stopped. Nor is this because of ne- 
cessity ; it is because of our short-span financial bias. It 
is no wonder that the few who have long-span money-minds 
can gather gold with ease. Greatest of all are the re- 
formers and saviors of their people, whose deep eyes see 
centuries ahead. 
Purposeful and purposeless, then, mark the most mean- 
ingful difference we can discover among minds. It is the 
difference between striving after a distant ideal, and being 
pushed ahead from the rear by compelling circumstances. 
“ A man’s conduct naturally shapes itself according to 
the ideas in his mind, and nothing contributes more to 
success in life than having a high ideal and keeping it con- 
stantly in view. Where such is the case one can hardly 
fail in attaining it.” * 
The in-minded and the out-minded. — The in-minded 
are they who feel greater faith in their own states of 
mind as a guide to successful living, than they do in the 
1 David Kay, Memory, etc., p. 213. 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  
260 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
objective world. The out-minded regard the environment 
as a great superior, to whose ways they must submit and 
adapt themselves. 
Two peoples, the Hindus and the English, throw up well 
the contrast between the in-minded and the out-minded. 
The Hindu lives in the clouds of mysticism, cultivating 
the kingdom of his mind. It is easier for him to deny the 
facts of the external world, or even to believe there is no 
external world at all, than to give up the belief that medi- 
tating on things mental, centering mind on mind, will 
make him master of his fate, superior to all circumstances. 
Compare the English mind as described by Emerson.t 
“They have a supreme eye to facts, and theirs is a logic 
that brings salt to soup, hammer to nail, oar to boat, . . . 
following the sequence of nature... . Their mind is not 
dazzled by its own means, but locked and bolted to re- 
sults. . . . They are impious in their skepticism of a theory, 
but kiss the dust before a fact. They are not to be led 
by a phrase, they want a working plan, a working machine, 
a working constitution, and will sit out the trial, and abide 
by the issue, and reject all preconceived theories.” 
The English govern the Hindus. 
The great fault of the in-minded is that they take them- 
selves too seriously. They may even believe that their 
thoughts control the weather, or that they could move 
mountains if only they could conjure up enough faith, or 
that they have a divine right to rule over others. And 
they are often as sensitive and important in their bearing 
as if they were guarding, in their personalities, the compass 
that steers the world.

In-mindedness is characteristic of children, and of the 
childhood of the race. As we have learned that the earth 
is not central in the universe, so we must learn that self 
is not central, either. With the maturing years, man and 
“most men tend to become more out-minded. 
The knowers, the feelers, and the willers. — In popular 
psychology, the mind is divided into three parts, Knowing, 
Feeling, and Willing. While it is rather crude to map the 
mind as one would a country, this old division has much 
practical value. 
“ Knowing” consists of sensation and all sense-com- 
plexes. “ Feeling” consists of affection and all affective- 
complexes. “‘ Willing” is, in general, the going-over of 
mental states into action, or at least, the settling of the 
mind into a determination to act. We may speak, then, 
of the knowers, the feelers, and the doers. 
Sensations (1) come into the mind and combine, associate 
to form sense-complexes (knowing), (2) set up agreeable 
or disagreeable affections and affective-complexes (feeling), 
and (3) express themselves in action (willing). Here, then, 
is a coursing of currents into the nervous system and out 
again. He who is bent on the in-taking and combining 
process, is a knower. Such is the man of thought, the 
scientist, the judge, the philosopher. He who aims chiefly 
at the out-putting of his mental product so as to move 
things, get something done, is a willer, doer, man of action, 
such as the general, the business head, the executive. He 
who sucks the sweet juice of his sensations, looking for the 
enjoyable rather than the thoughtful or practical, is a feeler. 
Such are the more emotional musicians, artists, and poets. 
The knower seeks the irwe; the feeler seeks the beautiful;
-P-A-G-E-262
    
262 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
the willer, the doer, seeks the good. Some balanced natures 
have all three tendencies in equal strength. 
Knowing, feeling, and willing in the world at large. — We 
find this triple type standing out everywhere — in religion, 
in literature, in popular speech, in government, in national 
character. The three great nations of antiquity were 
the intellectual Greeks, the emotional, intuitive Hebrews, 
and the strong-willed, executive Romans. In modern 
government, as if to combine all the virtues of the ancient 
world, we have a judicial, or intellectual, branch; a legis- 
lative, which responds to the feelings of the people; and 
an executive power. 
In popular speech, we find such expressions as “ head, 
heart, and hand.” Discourse is divided into Prose, the 
expression of the intellect, Poetry, the embodiment of 
feeling, and Oratory, whose aim is to move to action? 
The three essential qualities of discourse are clearness, 
elegance, and energy. Heaven is said to be a place of light 
(intelligence, knowing), love (good feeling), and life (action, 
will). Even the three Persons of the Trinity, the Father, 
Son, and Holy Ghost, are, if we may believe St. Augustine, 
the divine Knowing, Feeling, and Willing. So does man 
project himself into his world, struggling ever toward the 
true, the beautiful, the good. 
Knowing, feeling, and. willing as expressed in tempera- 
ment. — Temperament means general constitution. The 
idea is a rather vague one, but often helpful for large, 
practical purposes, as in quickly “ sizing up ” a pupil. 
Psychology gives one classification of temperaments,? 
1See Arnold Tompkins, The Science of Discourse, p. 34. 
? The psychological classification is based on (1) speed of thought and 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
INDIVIDUALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 263 
phrenology another. Probably the phrenological method 
(substantially that which follows) offers a quicker key to 
human nature; but the terms of both classifications may 
well be combined. 
The temperaments are three, mental, vital, motive. They 
are based on bodily build, but express the general mental 
qualities as well. 
The menial (knowing) temperament is marked by domi- 
nance of the nervous system, usually indicated by a head 
large in proportion to the body. Typically, the skeleton is 
small, the muscles are fine but compact, the vegetative 
systems, especially the digestive, not prominent. But a 
good thinker is likely to have good breathing capacity. 
Binet found such capacity to be the one most significant 
index of general physical excellence, and spoke of it as the 
“vital index.” The face is likely to be refined in feature 
and mobile in expression. Such a temperament is prone 
to take to books, and to select a bookish occupation. 
The vital (feeling) temperament is determined largely 
by the vegetative systems, the digestive especially. Typ- 
ically, the body is well rounded by adipose tissue, plump, 
if not stout. The features are likely to show a similar 
fullness, and commonly express good humor, the outflow 
of physiological prosperity. As.a rule, those of this tem-

Edward Bradford Titchener’s Primer of Psychology, p. 157, and his Be- 
ginner’s Psychology, p. 226.)

perament are not fine scholars — the fat pupil seldom stands 
at the head of his class; but they often shine in social 
qualities, kindliness, sympathy, and good cheer, and so 
are successful in dealing with their fellow men, as in business 
or politics. 
The motive (willing) temperament takes us back to the 
adaptive systems, this time the muscular. Commonly, 
the muscles and bones are large in proportion to other 
parts of the body, causing angularity and a kind of bold 
ruggedness which appears in the face also. Here, again, 
we do not expect profound intellect, especially along ab- 
stract lines; but we may look for quick and accurate per- 
ceptions, followed by ready action — skill at playing the 
game, even without the ability to explain it fully. Those 
of motive temperament are likely to be positively coura- 
geous and strong of will, or at least resistive, standing their 
ground well. They commonly choose occupations that 
require either muscular activity or mental executiveness. 
Often, these temperaments blend, and are named, ac- 
cordingly, mental-motive, mental-vital, and so on, placing 
first the name of the temperament which stands out most 
strikingly. One who combines the qualities of the three 
main types is said to be of balanced temperament.! 
What kind of mind, and how much? — The ever im- 
portant questions, What kind? and How much? here 
meet us again. Temperament is largely hereditary brain 
1 For a more extended account of temperament, phrenologically con- 
sidered, see Sizer and Drayton, Heads and Faces, and How to Study Them. 
Such books have excellent suggestive power, but are intuitional rather than 
scientific. Many of their statements must be taken, if at all, with a grain 
of salt. Keeping this warning in mind, the teacher can get much practical 
good from them.
-P-A-G-E-265
  INDIVIDUALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 265 
set. That gives us, roughly, the kind of mind; but as 
there are larger and lesser apples of every kind, so there are 
major and minor minds of each temperament. One of 
mental temperament may be a piping little pedant or a 
thought-builder of mighty soul. 
It is a truism, but one which can not be too often sounded 
in our ears, that whatever the type of mind, it can not 
grow to great proportions unless it springs from a healthy 
nervous system. Seldom do we find a sound mind in an 
unsound body. The great man is first of all a man of great 
nervous energy. Health is human horse power. 
Mental temperament: levels of ability. — Even in the 
lower animals, we can see the chief three temperaments 
illustrated. Among dogs, we have the intelligent shepherd 
and St. Bernard, the vital-minded pug, and the motive- 
minded bulldog. In man, we find, in each temperament, 
levels of ability rising from the animal stage upward. 
In the mental temperament, we can readily discover 
three levels: There are one-story, perceptive minds, two- 
story, discriminative minds, and three-story, constructive 
minds. Merely to perceive, and even to remember in a 
mimic, phonographic way, does not place one at any very 
proud height above the dog. All begin on the one-story, 
animal, perceptive level. The crucial question is, How far 
can a child build above that level? Can he ever learn to 
discriminate between mine and thine in property ; between 
words and phrases apparently alike, but of different signifi- 
cance; between the good and becoming, and the bad and 
disgraceful ? 
Originality, constructive ability ranks highest. Said 
one of Elihu Root’s clients, ‘I found that while many a
-P-A-G-E-266
   
   266 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
lawyer was able to tell me what I could noi do, Root was 
the one man ready to tell me what I could do.” For one 
Shakespeare who constructed plays, see how many hair- 
splitting critics to tear them to pieces! Thought which 
can construct a mental counterpart of the world we live 
in, and imagination which can build new worlds such as 
we should like to live in, are rare. 
Vital and motive temperaments: levels of ability. — 
Since, in general, exaltation of feeling and excellence of 
act can only follow some equally lofty sense-complex, we 
can distinguish in the vital and motive temperaments the 
same three levels as in the mental. One is (1) perceptive 
and imitative, or (2) discriminative and critical, or (3) com- 
prehensive and constructive, depending on his level of in- 
telligence. 
A good question to ask, especially if we wish to get a 
moral as well as a psychological rating of any person, is, 
How large a group is included in his feeling and acting? 
The petty man can not get beyond himself, or his fraternity, 
or his class kind, whatever it may be; nor does he regard 
the rights of posterity. The magnanimous mind responds 
to the state, the world, and even unborn generations. 
Philosophy is the supreme synthesis of knowing, religion 
the supreme synthesis of feeling, ethics and ethical conduct 
the supreme synthesis of willing and acting. 
Suggestibility and self-determination. — Whether one 
is a puppet or a person depends on whether he is sug- 
gestible or self-determined. 
The “ natural,” animal tendency is to respond to every 
stimulus immediately by action. This gives to ideas 
what is known as their “ motor aspect ”’: it is impossible 
   
-P-A-G-E-267
  INDIVIDUALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 267 
to think strongly of doing any deed without moving at 
least slightly toward its performance. Some can not ap- 
proach the edge of a ‘‘ jumping-off place ”’ without a danger- 
ous impulse to jump. Others are more susceptible to 
human, social suggestions, and quickly carry out whatever 
an associate puts into their heads. The trouble with all 
these people is feeble inhibitiveness. The career of such 
a one is like the course of a wandering stream, constantly 
meandering and doubling on itself. 
The self-determined person is clear as to his larger 
purposes, at least, and promptly inhibits whatever would 
interfere with them. He lives in the master cells of his 
brain, a brain that has lodged within itself the propelling 
and prohibiting power which the suggestible find outside 
of them. 
A great mind is distinguished by its self-determined 
loyalty to a long-span purpose. 
Dealing with pupils as individuals. — Individuality is 
based on differences. Luckily, people are not all made 
after the same machine pattern. Our pupils differ in 
physique, character, general intelligence ; in ideals, special 
abilities, traits_of all_kinds. In this chapter, we have 
noted a few only of the larger contrasts. There are other 
differences, perhaps less easily observed, but often of im- 
portance out of all proportion to the attention they are 
likely to attract. 
Our duty as teachers is not so much to reduce and con- 
ceal these differences as to discover and develop them. 
For their meaning extends beyond the petty performances 
of school days to the permanent interests of life. Such 
simple matters as delicacy of touch and steadiness of hand
-P-A-G-E-268
268 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
may determine one’s fitness for engraving, dentistry, 
surgery, or some other vocation. 
As in a play, we assign each actor the part in which he 
fits best, so on the stage of the world, each should find his 
part according to his talent. When we have learned more 
minutely the special abilities demanded by each vocation, 
we shall be able to select more and more accurately the 
worker who is best fitted for each line of work. In this 
way the school will be able to remove from the world, in 
time, the friction and dissatisfaction due to misfit men. 
What we must insist on having in our schools, then, are 
freedom and stimulus for self-development. We shall not 
only tolerate different amounts and rates of work within 
a class or subject, but encourage an early choice of subjects, 
with originality and independence in the method of master- 
ing them. Instead of so much mechanical riveting of 
ready-made facts into the memory, we shall watch our 
pupil more as he works his way toward graduation, record 
how his interests bud and grow, and preserve the record 
so that, when he leaves our school, we shall have a sketch 
(if not a photograph) of his ambitions, failures, abilities, 
and achievements, and a clear indication of what he should 
aspire to next.

Variations of personality as related to the nervous sys-

less, some harmful. Perhaps there are even more variations 
of mind; but these mental differences may lie boxed away 
in the brain, invisible for years, till some stimulus stirs 
them out. ; 
Partly for this reason, partly because we believe in the 
right of each person to live his own life, within liberal 
limits, our wonder is usually stirred only by the more strik- 
ing variations of mind and behavior. How explain the 
hysterical girl, the sleep-walking boy, the hypnotized sub- 
ject, the chronic weeper or fainter, the “ not exactly,” the 
woefully slow and nerveless who can not get excited, the 
woefully excited who can not slow down but have fits of 
“nerves ” and perhaps get “ flighty ”’?

272 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
The real wonder, however, is not that so many have a 
touch of such trouble, but that any one escapes — if in- 
deed any one does. For these are nerve troubles, and the 
nervous system is the last and most delicate organ nature 
has evolved, much more complex and easily injured than 
the finest watch. The lower animals, partly because of 
their more crudely built neurones, need no madhouses or 
homes for feeble-minded. Among them, the lower grades 
of mind perish by competition. Merciful man protects 
his mental weaklings, and even permits them to become 
the parents of more weaklings. Further, his finer in- 
telligence reserves worry as a human privilege: our lower 
animal relatives do not know enough to worry as we do. 
This worry-friction throws our mental machines still 
further out of kilter. 
A general view of the difficulty. — Now, what is the 
matter with our precious nervous systems when they fail 
to function properly? What ails this chief adaptive sys- 
tem when it does not adapt? 
Let us review a little. We have learned (in Chapter I) 
that mind, our thoughts and feelings, lies between what the 
world does to us and what we do in return, between stimuli 
and reactions. There is a constant coursing of currents 
through some part (though perhaps not always the con- 
scious part) of the nervous system, from stimulus-in to 
reaction-out. In this chain of nervous events, there are 
three big links corresponding to the three kinds of neurone 
(see Chapter V), afferent, connecting, and efferent. The 
sound mind, then, perceives efficiently, associates (and 
feels) efficiently, and efficiently goes out into action. The 
unsound mind (to express the process in the five steps of
-P-A-G-E-273
  STRIKING VARIATIONS OF PERSONALITY 273 
Chapter III) fails in gathering experience, or recording 
and reproducing experience, or analyzing experience, or 
synthesizing experience, or expressing experience in con- 
duct. 
One may be adjudged mentally deranged or malingering 
when he merely fails to perceive. A soldier was brought 
to the ear specialist of a camp examining board with the 
report that he must be malingering, as he failed to 
respond to commands that were shouted at him, but 
understood at once when quietly told that dinner was 
ready. The specialist found that the soldier was stone 
deaf, but had unconsciously learned lip reading. He could 
understand only when permitted to watch the speaker’s 
mouth. 
Difficulties of perception are illustrated in illusion and 
hallucination (see Chapter VIII), and in the “ clouding of 
consciousness,” which renders it difficult for stimuli to 
cross the threshold of consciousness and make themselves 
felt. This may be brought about by disease or other ab- 
normal condition. For example, in delirium tremens, the 
horrible visions that float through the mind of the patient 
appear to shut him off from the objective world almost 
wholly. The people moving about him he does not see, 
but only those conjured up by his excited brain cells. 
“ Sensory stimuli of ordinary strength or even more than 
ordinary strength, fail to cross the threshold of his con- 
sciousness and cause perception. If, however, the patient 
be taken firmly by the shoulders and held or even mildly 
shaken while a question is practically yelled at him, we 
may find that he will give a perfectly lucid and correct 
answer. The strength of the sensations has been suf- 
 
-P-A-G-E-274

ficiently increased, the resistance has been broken down, 
perception takes place.” ! 
Failure ‘to record and reproduce experience normally 
is found in( amnesia, or loss of memory. This may be 
partial, in which case one loses his memory for a certain 
class of experience, such as words, or for the events of a 
given period. One such patient, when his wife came be- 
fore him, could recall when he met the lady, and their 
associations as friends, but remembered nothing of their 
marriage or married life. Amnesia may also be general, 
banishing all memory of one’s previous existence. If 
amnesia is brought on by disease or illness, memory is 
likely to return; but if it appears as a gradually increasing 
impairment, as in old age, the outlook is less hopeful. 
Examples of faulty analysis and association, feeling, and 
expression, will appear later in our discussion. 
Nervous currents and resistances. —It will help us 
greatly in understanding peculiarities of personality if 
we think of an individual as so much nervous energy dis- 
charging itself along particular paths. Evidently, then, 
all depends on two factors, (1) the amount of energy and 
(2) the paths it follows. Which path is used will depend 
on the relative amounts of resistance at the various gates 
of escape. The normal person is charged with a goodly 
degree of energy, held in perfect control by a system of 
delicate escapement arrangements. 
(x) There may be too little energy to make a person of, 
so to speak, resulting in some kind of asthenia, weakness. 
Such are psychasthenia (mental weakness) and neuras- 
thenia (nervous weakness, “ nerves,” ‘ nervousness ”’).

The psychasthenic feels, in general, that the world is too 
much for him, may have all sorts of fears (phobias) and 
obsessions, and even comes to feel that such a simple act 
as getting out of bed and putting on his clothes is for him 
an enormous impossibility. The neurasthenic finds that 
even small stimuli and minor matters “ get on his nerves ”” 
or “ drive him wild.” If naturally aggressive or in urgent 
circumstances, he may fidget, scold, and pitch into any- 
thing that happens along, sure that the world (and not 
himself) has gone wrong, and cursing the spite that ever 
he was born to set it right. If naturally retiring, he is 
likely to retire still farther and “ cry it out.” 
Further decrease of nervous energy in the upper centers 
of the brain results in loss of “ psychic tension,” and so of 
the “ sense of reality,” the ability to perceive and feel the 
world as it is. Things are hazy, obscure, or “ mixed up,” 
as when one wakes with difficulty or recovers from some 
other loss of consciousness. He may even believe him- 
self dead, or that he has become some other person. Per- 
haps everything seems “ far away,” as the world appears 
to recede when we drift off to sleep. There is a lack of 
pure blood, or of good nerve tissue, or of both these es- 
sentials. 
Probably emotional exaltation and depression are also 
closely related to mental (psychic) tension. A good 
measure of this index of personality can be read off from 
the tensity, and hence the reflective power, of the eye. 
(2) As to channels. If all inhibitors are off, all escape- 
| ments wide open, we have a nervous condition resulting 
in convulsions, the convulsive forms of hysteria, and the 
like. If the channels of the cortex chiefly are free, there
-P-A-G-E-276
  276 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
may be mania, or “ flight of ideas,” expressed, perhaps, 
in “ wild and whirling words.” In such condition, unless 
the nerve currents are moving in torrents, the subject 
is usually very suggestible, and by a sharp command may 
even be inhibited into self-control. A physician once 
found himself alone with a powerful maniac who declared 
he could jump unharmed from the seventh story window 
to the ground. He started toward the window, when the 
physician quickly replied, ‘‘ That’s nothing: I can jump 
from the ground to the window!” The patient’s atten- 
tion was diverted, and the physician, on being challenged 
to trial, led him to a place of safety. 
Over-inhibition, with closure of channels, probably 
underlies such difficulties as negativism, melancholia, 
and the shut-in personality. The negativistic person 
refuses practically all suggestions, even reasonable re- 
quests. 
The melancholiac sees all things dark, but does nothing 
to make them bright. The shut-in personality “ closes 
up ” on approach, shares no secrets, and is alone in what- 
ever company. The over-inhibited can often be dis- 
covered by watching their limited and somewhat set and 
mechanical facial movements, especially those of the jaw 
in speaking. 
In dealing with any striking variations of personality, 
we can usually help ourselves to an understanding of it by 
considering (1) the source of the stimuli that produce it. 
For example, diseases such as fevers and pneumonia fre- 
quently develop toxins which, by their action on the 
neurones of the cortex, produce delirium. This is not 
alarming unless it is an index of a dangerous stage in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
STRIKING VARIATIONS OF PERSONALITY 277 
disease. We must consider also (2) the strength of the 
nervous currents, and (3) their probable course. All 
queerness is (almost certainly) due to some interference with 
the proper production or distribution of nervous impulses. 
Bodily causes of mental variations. — First, as to in- 
heritance. Mind, as such, may not be inherited; but 
brain is, and the build of the brain has much to do with 
the make-up of the mind that lives in it. Psychiatrists 
estimate that from sixty to seventy per cent of all mental 
troubles have an inherited basis, and there is no case that 
would not have been different had its inheritance been 
changed. _ 
We have already (in Chapter II) noted the effect of 
injury to the brain. In fact, psychiatry and psychology 
are coming to the conclusion that there is no way to injure 
the mind unless we do injure the brain. The old principle, 
“No psychosis without a neurosis,” holds throughout. 
Of course, many of these injuries are not open to the eye, 
but microscopically small. The physician, by deftly 
administered doses of certain drugs, can make the patient 
a devotee of them, powerless to resist. Here is a brain 
change chemically produced, a new set, minute and subtle, 
yet tremendous in its effects on the mental life. Many a 
patient has become a “ dope fiend ” through ignorance or 
recklessness in the administering of habit-producing drugs 
such as morphine, cocain, or heroin, to induce sleep or 
anesthesia. 
Further, the brain may be much upset by disturbances 
among the bodily organs. The nervous system, as the 
governing system of the body, is charged with maintaining 
the other systems in a state of balance, so that each does
-P-A-G-E-278
  
278 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
its proper work and exercises its rightful influence. But 
if the body is thrown out of balance, the mind may be un- 
balanced too. A sluggish liver may cause a sluggish, 
dizzy mind. A certain type of goiter is accompanied by 
fear and worry. The mental vagaries due to the sexual 
system have inspired whole books. In general, physicians 
expect a patient to be down-hearted if his disease is below 
the diaphragm, up-hearted and cheerful if it is above — 
but there are exceptions. 
Peculiar mental states due to exhaustion and fatigue 
poisons, as well as to other poisons, whether introduced 
from outside the body or formed within it, as in ptomain 
poisoning, are of common observation. 
Mental causes of mental variations. — A man loses his 
fortune, worries constantly, suffers mental collapse. A 
father dies suddenly, and his daughter thereafter faints 
whenever anything causes her to relive the sad scene. 
A soldier may fear death so much that he commits suicide. 
A great deal of what passes under the term “ shell shock ” 
has no more to do with artillery shells than with oyster 
shells, but is due to anxiety or other mental strain. A 
soldier who had come through several battles, sound, began 
to worry about his sweetheart, and developed “ shell shock ” 
on receiving a letter stating that she was untrue to him. 
In such cases, the stimuli are too strong for the nervous 
system that receives them. While the trouble may seem 
purely mental, there is of course a neural basis for it here 
also. Some nervous systems, however, are so strong that 
no mental disturbance can upset them. They can not be 
driven insane by anything short of chemical action (such 
as poison) or actual physical injury to the brain. 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
  STRIKING VARIATIONS OF PERSONALITY 279 
The subconscious.— We have already glimpsed the 
subconscious in connection with Common Sense, Sub- 
conscious Cerebration, and Brain Set. Brain set, we have 
found, is unconscious, yet largely determines consciousness. 
As the “lay of the land”’ causes water to flow in certain 
directions, so the set of the brain causes the stream of 
consciousness to flow in certain channels. 
“T do not like you, Dr. Fell, 
The reason why I cannot tell; 
But this one thing I know full well: 
I do not like you, Dr. Fell! ” 
Now, the reason why I do not like Dr. Fell may be that 
some one who looked or acted as he does played me a foul 
trick years ago — so long ago that I have forgotten both 
the act and the actor; but the scar is there in my brain, 
turning the currents of my like and dislike without my 
knowing why. If I ruminated over it a half hour, I might 
bring up in consciousness the name and face of the offender, 
just as by retrospecting my childhood I can bring back 
many an event lost to me for years, but which did its bit 
in shaping my character, nevertheless. 
Evidently, whatever is “ out of mind” may have sunk 
_ to different depths, so to speak, from that which is tem- 
porarily out of attention (as your name when you are not 
thinking of it) to that which can be “ fished up” with 
difficulty only, or not at all. Some reserve the term 
“subconscious ” for that which is buried so deeply that we 
can not bring it back to consciousness at all, such as your 
performances during the first year of your life. It may 
include that which never has been conscious (for you), 
such as the control of the size of the pupil of your eye.
-P-A-G-E-280
  280 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
As current events are the most important events for us, 
but are still only a very small fraction of history, so our 
present consciousness is most important for us, but is only 
a very small fraction of our total life. And as the course 
of current events is fixed by past events, so our conscious 
lives are like streams flowing over the bed, smooth or rocky, 
of our subconsciousness. 
The subconscious is the (psycho-physiological) stratum 
of personality which lies between the purely conscious and 
the purely physiological. 
Now, it is characteristic of this subconscious stratum 
to boil up, so to speak, perhaps even to erupt, into con- 
sciousness; and it may intrude its influence in either a 
wholesome or a harmful way. Just as, in studying memory, 
we found that one can often recall best by simply waiting 
until his subconsciousness has found the forgotten item, 
so authors, artists, and other originators often find they 
can produce their best results by charging their minds to 
achievement and then waiting, passively, perhaps, for their 
“inspiration.” Good. But (if we may accept the find- 
ings of a very influential school of psychiatrists) there may 
also be lurking in the caverns of the subconscious many 
“repressed wishes,” perhaps dating back to childhood. 
The word “ wish,”’ as here used, has a very broad meaning. 
It includes tendencies, leanings, proclivities, appetences, 
urgings, some of which may never have been consciously 
recognized at all. Such repressed wishes may set up 
many sorts of neurasthenic and psychasthenic behavior, 
and that without the subject’s realizing at all the true 
cause of it. 
So, a young lady who often appeared to stumble or leap
-P-A-G-E-281
  STRIKING VARIATIONS OF PERSONALITY 281 
in peculiar fashion, explained that she had slipped, turned 
her ankle, etc. The true explanation was that years be- 
fore, she had been disappointed in love and had attempted 
suicide by jumping from a bridge. Without realizing the 
significance of her behavior, she was partially repeating 
the original leap in her peculiar jumps. 
Evidently, one should be careful as to what he builds 
into his subconsciousness, or permits to become encysted 
there. And one of the most serious responsibilities of 
parents and teachers, probably, is the supervision of the 
subconscious foundations of personality in children. 
Sleep and similar states. — Perhaps the most striking 
variation of mental personality is its daily vanishing and 
recurrence. If we were to represent our conscious life by 
a line, it would be a broken one, as shown, the breaks 
representing sleep. 
The cause of sleep is unknown; but it is commonly 
accompanied by a reduction of the amount of blood in the 
brain,’ by a relaxation of the blood vessels there, and 
probably by a widening of synapses. Apparently, it is 
the adaptive systems that most need sleep, for the vegeta- 
tive systems, though slowed in their activity, continue their 
work. The cells of the body generally are rebuilt, and in 
the nervous system, there is a notable replenishing of the © 
nuclei of fatigued neurones. 
The threshold of consciousness is higher, rising during 
the first hour, approximately, and then falling rapidly 
until the third or fourth hour, after which the average 
1 Some observers state that the quantity of blood in the brain is increased 
during sleep.

       282 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
sleeper may be wakened by sounds that are comparatively 
slight. 
The amount of sleep necessary varies much with in- 
dividuals. Children need more than adults. Certain 
brilliant persons require only five or six hours of sleep; 
others, equally able, need nine. If we would be healthy- 
minded, we must determine the amount of sleep necessary 
for us, and see that we get it. It has been suggested that 
we may evolve into a race that needs no sleep; but we 
are not progressing very rapidly in that direction. 
Another sleep-habit, invaluable for avoiding insomnia, 
is that of “‘ switching off” and going to sleep promptly on 
retiring. Faithful practice when we are free and self- 
controlled will enable us always to close the curtains of the 
mind against the glare of care and worry. 
Dreams appear to be a kind of mental gambol: our 
associations, unchecked by the usual restrictions of waking 
life, run freely wherever the channels happened to be left 
open when the brain slowed down to sleep. The dream 
may take its start from a dominant idea, as when extremely 
pleasurable or disagreeable experience with anything is 
followed by a dream about it; or it may be set up by 
stimuli outside the body, as when a too low temperature 
starts a dream of icebergs or arctic exploration. 
Freud! asserts that every dream — and everybody, it 
is assumed, has dreams, though he may forget them — 
every dream is the outcome of a repressed “ wish.” Ac- 
cording to the Freudian theory of the subconscious, which 
underlies this explanation of dreams, our mental life is 
the result of two motives, usually opposed to each other, 
1 An Austrian psychologist. The name is pronounced as if spelled Froit.
-P-A-G-E-283
  STRIKING VARIATIONS OF PERSONALITY 28, 3, 
the pleasure motive and the reality motive. The pleasure 
motive is our personal desire to express ourselves and to get 
what we want when we want it, as if the whole world were 
subject to our will. But “the world,” that is external 
reality, is often cold, resistive, crushing. Hence comes 
the “reality motive,” the necessity of getting what we 
want, not arbitrarily, but only by adjusting ourselves with 
the omnipotent environment. 
Now, while we are awake, these two motives fight it 
out as best they may, many wishes being repressed and con- 
cealed in the subconscious ; but in sleep, the reality motive 
is removed and the pleasure motive has its free fling. The 
- result (according to this theory) is that our dreams express 
our deepest natures, and are even more significant than our 
deliberate statements about ourselves. If you want to 
know a man, get him to tell you his dreams. According 
to Freud, the unfulfilled wish which expresses itself in a 
dream, often takes on a symbolic form: some good person 
who appears in the dream may represent one’s better nature, 
and so on. A skilled interpreter is necessary to reveal the 
full meaning of the dream. 
Fainting is much like sleep, and may almost be thought 
of as sleep forcibly induced by shock. No one ever dies 
of it, and in itself, it is of no great importance. It is serious 
only when it indicates some serious condition underlying it. 
Hypnosis also is much like sleep. Nearly all normal 
persons can be hypnotized by some monotonous, quieting 
stimulus which draws and holds the attention, such as 
gazing upward at a bright object, stroking, pressure on the 
hands, and the like, especially if reénforced by soothing 
or overpowering surroundings and “ sleep talk,” that is, 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  
284 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
suggestions of sleep. Waking occurs at the command of 
the hypnotist, or, if the subject is left to himself, as from 
normal sleep. 
The explanation of hypnosis is yet to be found. The 
neurones of the subject appear to be given over almost 
wholly to the control of the operator. There may be 
“ psychic anesthesia,” in which the subject hears, sees, 
“ feels,” that only which the operator wishes him to ex- 
perience, his other sensory neurones failing to function. 
The association neurones are quiescent, while the efferent 
fibers carry out the commands of the hypnotist almost as 
if he had lodged himself in the subject’s brain. 
One of the most notable after-effects which can be pro- 
duced by hypnosis is that due to “ post-hypnotic sug- 
gestion.” Although the subject, as a rule, can not recall 
what took place during his trance period, yet the operator 
can fix in his subconsciousness a command to be executed 
later. Such a command is usually carried out faithfully ; 
and the subject, ignorant of the real reason for his be- 
havior, may invent an artificial one. 
Because of this strange power of post-hypnotic suggestion, 
it has been used to some extent to effect cures and personal 
reforms. A smoker, for example, if told during hypnosis 
that he will find smoke disagreeable, is quite sure to find 
it so for a time. But hypnosis as a curative agent is being 
replaced by milder and more effective means. 
Shifting personality. — “T am not myself to-day,” I 
remark, as I realize that I am not feeling or acting quite 
as usual. Query: then who am I? Further, we all 
realize that we may be one kind of person at sport, another 
at study; or that the self-at-home may be quite different 
   
-P-A-G-E-285
  STRIKING VARIATIONS OF PERSONALITY 285 
from the self-away-from-home, or the self-alone a con- 
trast with the self-in-a-crowd. The fact is, each of us, in- 
stead of being only one, is quite a group: there is enough 
material in every personality to make a number of persons, 
if only we could get them parted. 
Naturally enough, the way to part them is to make them 
dislike each other, as the converted man hates his former 
sinful self. Now, the essential thing in the make-up of a 
person appears to be a group of ideas that associate readily, 
that are friendly, we may almost say, as a nation is a great 
group of people in friendly association, organized as a unit. 
But if there are two centers, we have, in effect, two nations. 
Something similar is true of the mind. So, a man may live 
for years as a respected member of some community, but 
suddenly forget his identity, leave family and friends, go to 
a new place, take a new name and be a new person, with 
no memory of his former existence, at all. Later, he may 
“come to himself’? — the old self, and let the new one 
die. Sometimes there is repeated oscillation between two 
selves, each of which may or may not be aware of the 
existence of the other. And these two selves may differ 
in knowledge, in feelings, and in behavior. They may 
almost seem to be of different nationalities, for one may 
know some foreign language and the other not. Indeed, 
such dual or multiple personalities (for there are some- 
times more than two of them) may apparently have noth- 
ing in common except that they live in the same body. 
The phenomena of the spirit medium seem to be closely 
related here, since the medium, while in a state of trance, 
is apparently under the control of some kind of second self. 
Neither spiritual communication nor communication by 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
286 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
thought alone (telepathy) between two embodied minds 
appears to have been demonstrated satisfactorily. But we 
should keep our minds open on such matters. 
Hysteria is due to a shrinking of the personality, that 
is, of the field of experience that constitutes the self. 
Such shrinking apparently results (in part at least) from 
a lack of sufficient nerve energy to electrify all the neurones 
that function when the patient is “all there.” Because 
of his patchy, tattered mentality, he may appear to be 
“ beside ee a different person. Anesthesia or 
paralysis of certain parts of the body may also appear, 
due to the fact that the neurones of those parts are out of 
commission, or not in proper connection with the high- 
level centers of the brain. 
Insanity. — We have ceased to think of insanity as a 
sort of demon, an awful thing that gets possession of a 
person and makes him thereafter a terrible creature. One 
is insane when he fails to get himself and his environment 
successfully adjusted ; and as we all fail to some extent, we 
are all insane to some degree. 
Using the term insanity broadly, it includes amentia, 
lack of mind from birth, as well as dementia, deterioration 
of a mind once good. The three commonly distinguished 
grades of amentia are exemplified in the moron (Greek for 
fool), the imbecile, and the idiot. The idiot may be able 
to look after his bodily wants but can do no work intelli- 
gently. The imbecile plays, and may be able to do odd 
jobs and light errands. The moron can do routine work, 
but lacks the ability to plan. We are learning to recognize 
the latter two classes in our schools, and to provide courses 
for them particularly. 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  STRIKING VARIATIONS OF PERSONALITY 287 
Dementia has many forms, the most common being 
mania, melancholia, paranoia, general paresis, and dementia 
precox. Some of these can be readily understood as ex- 
aggerations of original temperament. The flighty, ex- 
citable person, of rapid associations, if he becomes un- 
balanced, is likely to be a maniac; he of slow associations 
and over-serious views, a melancholiac. One of undue 
self-importance may, by still further exaggeration of his 
ego, become paranoid, or a paranoiac. General paresis 
(paralysis) is a gradually increasing paralysis and mental 
decay, both due to affected brain tissue. 
The form of insanity which the teacher is most likely 
to find in her flock is dementia precox. The child, who 
may be of excellent mental ability, is likely to show loss 
of energy, become moody and “ shut-in,” grow melancholic 
and mope alone, and perhaps have delusions and hallucina- 
tions, hearing and seeing things which are not “ there.” 
He is likely also to think that others are talking about him, 
ridiculing him, planning and conspiring against him. 
Such cases should early be brought to the attention of a 
psychiatrist. 
Our attitude toward personal peculiarities. — As stated 
at the opening of this chapter, we believe in the right of - 
each person to live his life in his own way, within wide 
limits. We should hold to this attitude. If our fellow 
man appears queer or crazy, it is probably because we do 
not yet thoroughly understand him. It will most likely 
do us good to try to enter into his life, see it from his view- 
point, and think what we would do if we were to live it as 
our own. 
We must be especially tolerant with children; for growth 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  288 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
brings them naturally many vagaries which will just as 
naturally pass away. We must all develop through many 
lesser, fragmentary selves toward the unified, complete, 
whole-souled personality. 
CLASS EXERCISES 
1. Try to answer now the questions formulated when this chapter 
was begun. 
2. Various members of the class may investigate and report on 
topics that appear to be of special interest, perhaps spiritism, hyp- 
notism, the education of mentally peculiar children, or the treatment 
of the insane. 
3. Secure from teachers and report on various examples of peculiar 
children actually found in the schoolroom. Suggest how best to deal 
with them. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Mention any striking variations of personality you have 
learned of in connection with historical characters. In connection 
with well-known literary characters, such as Lady Macbeth. Can 
you explain these peculiarities? 
2. Tell some things you could do to an individual that might 
cause him to behave queerly. What is the probable action on the 
nervous system in each case? 
3. Children appear to cry more readily than adults. How do you 
account for this? 
4. Mention some facial signs that serve as an index to the con- 
dition of the mind, or the nervous system. 
5. Suppose a child is controlled chiefly through the motive of 
fear. What effect is this likely to have on his subconsciousness ? 
6. Why are individuals, social groups, or nations that have been 
subject to severe repression, likely to indulge in wild and unrestrained 
behavior when opportunity offers? 
7. What do you think is going on in the nervous system of the 
sleep-walker ?
-P-A-G-E-289

8. Just how should you determine the amount of sleep necessary 
for you? 
9. A child toys with his pencil and waits for ideas. One who is 
trying to remember may scratch his head. Explain these cases. 
to. Do you think we should make use of the subconscious as much 
as possible or as little as possible? Why? Mention some of its uses. 
11. In case of mental trouble, why is it better to ‘“‘ have it out ” 
than to cork it up in one’s heart and brood over it ? 
12. Psychiatrists say it is often necessary to know the whole life 
history of one who has mental or nervous trouble in order to under- 
stand the case. Why should this be? 
13. You find your book or pencil mislaid, can not remember hav- 
ing placed it where you find it, yet know that no one but yourself 
could have placed it there. Can this be explained in terms of dual 
personality ? 
14. Alcohol breaks down inhibitors and puts the higher centers 
of the brain out of function. Show how this explains some of the be- 
havior of the drunken man. Does temptation then become easier 
or harder to resist ? 
1g. (a) The novice, in driving a machine, often runs it by ex- 
tremes, perhaps turning the steering wheel too far to right and left, etc. 
(b) One who is usually strongly inhibited may on occasion “ loosen 
up ” and become the most hilarious of a whole group. 
Do you see any connection between (a) and (6)?

CHAPTER XVII 
MENTAL HYGIENE AND MENTAL EFFICIENCY 
Exercise. — Consider yourself and your playmates as you were in 
the schooldays of childhood and early youth. Describe any who were 
regarded as “ queer,’ who were extremely nervous, or irritable, or 
possessed of evil habits, or fearful, or passionate, or silly, or impulsive, 
or whining, always blaming others, or picked upon, or given to worry- 
ing, or sulky, or morbid, or very secretive, or inclined to be alone a 
great deal. Did you show any of these traits? Did your teachers? 
How have your companions developed? Have the early pe- 
culiarities shown in later life? What, if anything, could have been 
done for them by a sympathetic teacher who knew them intimately ? 
Point out conditions which, as you think, made you more or less 
effective in your mental work. 
Briefly describe what you regard as the chief characteristics of a 
healthy, efficient mind. 
The new ideal in education. — “‘ We need more and more 
a psychology which will occupy itself with character 
formation and with the individual and its struggles and dis- 
harmonies, and, on the part of the school, an appreciation 
that dry knowledge is not the only thing that is needed, 
but training to efficiency, and efficiency on the level adapted 
to the individual, at the bottom of which lies adequate 
self-management.” So speaks August Hoch.! 
We do not thoroughly educate a child merely by filling 
his brain full of facts in the hope that the accumulated 
weight of them will turn the wheels of life to the end. Not 
acquisition, but development, is our watchword. Lu

is like an electric current; and our great achievement for \ 
the child lies not in the large amount of work we can get 
him to do in early years while the current is weak, but in 
strengthening the batteries until the volts and amperes 
are so high that ordinary tasks are easy. , The education 
of the future will care less about teaching all branches of 
study to all pupils, more about saving and using the pe- 
culiar powers of the individual mind. 
This means an increasing emphasis on mental hygiene 
and mental efficiency. ‘. 
Mental and physical health. + Rarely does a rugged 
mind live in a very frail body. ‘Mind depends on brain, 
brain depends on blood, and blood must be fed and aired 
and kept pure.) 
Most of us know all this, and most of us go on acting as 
if we knew it not. After a three or four years’ campaign 
against tuberculosis, a physician found a well-to-do family 
of four living in their own newly-built house, all sleeping 
in the same room with all windows tightly closed even 
during mild weather. Two children had died in infancy, 
and a third was fading. The expert who was called on the 
case prescribed fresh air. The teacher must serve as priest 
and minister of Hygeia, and must see, not only that every 
tongue confesses, but that every knee actually bows,! 
that faith is followed by works. 
1 It is the author’s practice to review himself each day on the “Fifteen 
Rules of Hygiene,” as found in How to Live, by Irving Fisher and Eugene

Rules of mental hygiene. — Health draws; disease re- 
pels. And this is true of mind as well as body. The 
teacher should if possible be a generation better than his 
time, for after him the next generation will be molded. 
It would help greatly if we could photograph healthy 
minds and gaze upon them frequently. But we can study 
and imitate them. Following are the chief rules which 
the sound mind seems to obey. 
1. Look at life in the large. Take a big view of things. 
As Marcus Aurelius puts it in his Meditations, “Look 
round at the courses of the stars, as if thou wert going along 
with them.” [Seeing life as a whole gives a sense of pro- 
portion, balance, and harmony.) In such a mighty land- 
scape, small things disappear. ‘So we draw the attention 
of our worried friend away from some troublesome trifle by 
telling him “It will make no difference a hundred years 
from now.” 
Herein lies much of the comfort and joy of religion, 
philosophy, and science of the grander sort: they show 
us our petty selves made whole through our relation to the 
Universe, physical and mental. Recall the oft-quoted 
words of Kant: ‘Two things fill the mind with ever- 
increasing awe and admiration; the star-lit heavens above, 
and the Moral Law within.’’ Contemplation of such 
greatness, with the realization that we are a part of it, 
meats and eggs. 8. Eat some hard, some bulky, some raw foods. 9. Eat 
slowly. 
III. Poisons.— 10. Evacuate thoroughly, regularly, and frequently. 
11. Stand, sit, and walk erect. 12. Do notallow poisons and infections to 
enter the body. 13. Keep the teeth, gums, and tongue clean. 
IV. Activity. — 14. Work, play, rest, and sleep in moderation. 15. Keep 
serene.

makes us feel that we are great — and a great soul should 
do no small thing. The whole-souled man sees the unity 
of the world (knowing), feels the actual or possible harmony 
of the whole, and wills and works for the welfare of all 
humanity. 
3, eeu a great purpose. Whoever seeks his own selfish 
will is traveling toward zero; but he who seeks to serve 
mankind is facing toward infinity) We must ask, as 
Tennyson does in his In Memoriam, that the living will 
shall “flow through our deeds and make them pure.” 
Our greatest men feel that it is not merely they alone who 
do their deeds, but some power greater than themselves 
striving within them, warming them to their work. 
Pursuing a great purpose does not mean that we shall all 
strive for fame, nor that children shall all be spurred to 
ambitious careers. But the purposeless life leads to 
despair! — and sometimes to tragedy. / Mind, like water, 
should keep moving to keep sweet» As some one has said, 
“To educate for idleness is to educate for aerate 
The best business for each of us is that which pulls him 
with the most power. 
3. Practice mental hardening. When we wish to-guard_ 
against ills that may attack the body, we harden the body 
by deliberate discipline, by exercise and cold baths, until 
it can stand any ordinary shock without damage. Yet 
our minds, meanwhile, may remain so flabby and tender 
as to fall a prey to mental disease. Unfortunately, per- 
haps, we can not bring on the mild mental shock, and steel 
ourselves to stand it; but we may all spend a little while 
each day practicing courage, setting ourselves to meet with

   PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
  204 
serenity whatever comes, to fear no evil even though we 
walk through the valley of the shadow of death. 
( Children should be encouraged to meet and conquer all 
heir ordinary worries and troubles, and not to shun them. 
Never to lift a burden means, at length, to have no strength 
to lift with. The nerve specialist finds it is often the child 
that has been too much shielded whose nerves give way 
in later life. While parents should not provoke their 
children to wrath, they should subject them to annoyance, 
even artificially created for the purpose, if necessary, and 
teach them to bear it. But of course such mental-moral 
exercise should be carefully proportioned to strength, and 
given always when the child is not fatigued, sleepy, or ex- 
cited, but fresh and fully fit for an effort at self-mastery. 
Those who grow up without graduating from such a 
course in self-control are likely to fidget themselves and 
everybody around them who is capable of fidgets. A 
lady went to her physician begging for help “in the name 
of mercy and pity.” ‘‘ The sound of her husband chewing 
at table completely upset her, and when he smoked, the 
noise made by the puffing of the smoke was torture to her; 
the creaking of her mother’s shoes about the house made her 
most uncomfortable during a period of several months. 
Obviously the abnormal idea in such a case caused the 
suffering, not the sensory impulse itself.”’ 
4.\ Keep your poise. Most of us do not sufficiently 
realize our importance, in a large and sensible way. As 
Royce of Harvard used to say in his lectures, Each of us is

the center of the universe — his universe, and round him 
all is organized; only, we must respect all the other centers 
of the universe! “Feel, and work to make it true, that 
you have abundarice of reserve power. Nothing can de- 
stroy you. Be fearless, confident, free from worry, relaxed. 
Feel, like the athlete, that you are not responsible for the 
final score; your only business is to play the game well. 
“A business man who had set his heart on fulfilling a 
large responsibility nearly wrecked his health from worry 
over the outcome. His wise physician prescribed that, 
before sitting down to his desk each day, he should spend 
five minutes repeating and impressing on his mind the 
words, ‘I don’t give a hang! I don’t givea hang!’ The 
truth is many people fail because of over-anxiety lest they 
fail. Some invalids die from an exaggerated desire not 
ta die.” * 
Bi von good mental habits. A person is, pretty largely, 
his ideals plus his habits. If we get our ideals clear and 
straight, and form (and break) our mental habits accord- 
ingly, we shall be psychically sun) 
To go into detail concerning good habits to be formed 
and bad ones to be broken would in itself require a whole 
book. Here we can consider, and that but briefly, the 
general classes of mental habit, (x) habits of the intellect, 
(2) of emotion, and (3) of volition. 
(x) Order is not only heaven’s first law, but it is the 
first law of the kingdom of heaven which you hope to set 
up within you. 
Back of all lasting order lies planning. 
As in the physical world we want a place for everything

  2 96 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
and everything in its place, so in the mental world we want. 
a-time-for-everything and everything in its time. There 
should be an ideal for the life, a plan for the year, a pro- 
gram for the day. “ The difficulty,” says Judd, speaking 
of overworked teachers, “is not so much in the fact that 
teachers have to think and plan, as that they come to their 
work in a state of mental confusion and excitement which 
renders any task difficult.” + 
Concentration, unit-mindedness, the one-thing-at-a-time 
attitude, distinguishes the master mind. {Work when you 
work and play when you play. One must concentrate on 
recreation as well as on work. At table, center your mind 
on happy eating and agreeable companionship. Don’t 
spoil your game or your walk by carrying all through it a 
load of anxious thought. And on going to bed, learn to 
turn off consciousness as you do your electric light. 
Says William Penn, “ Always remember to bound thy 
Thoughts to the present Occasion. If it be thy Religious 
Duty, suffer nothing else to Share in them. And if any 
Civil or Temporal Affair, observe the same Caution, and 
thou wilt be a whole Man to every Thing, and do twice the 
Business in the same Time.” ? 
By careful planning, and by concentration in executing 
our plans, we can avoid one of the most common causes 
of superficial work and of distress of soul, namely, hurry. 
Observe that the child in school is prevented from planning 
the larger features of his work, and that school conditions 
too often favor distraction rather than concentration. It 
is sad to think how many children are probably contract- 
ing bad mental habits in school.

(2)| Emotional health requires that we kill off the feel- 
ings that are bad for us and practice those that are good for 
us. )There is reason to believe that a large proportion, if 
not/the major portion, of those who lose their positions 
do not lack either intellect or skill, but emotional control. 
Many are egocentric, paranoid, have too much self-feeling ; 
others are emotionally unstable; and still others, emotion- 
ally weak.! 
Now, which are the good and which the bad? Feelings 
are of two kinds, the enlarging and the reducing. We should 
encourage the “enlarging and repress the reducing. By an 
enlarging feeling is meant one which brings us into relations| 
of unity with a larger circle of environment. Hence the 
Christian teaching that all-embracing love is the greatest 
thing in the world, and that even God is love. A reducing 
feeling, such as clannish or personal pride or hate, tends 
toward class division and selfish individualism. It would 
be strange if we were exhorted to dwell in hate, and to 
believe that God is hate. 
One’s prevailing mental state should be that of happi- 
ness and humor. It is surprising to find how much can be 
accomplished by just setting the mind to be happy what- 
ever the circumstances. Humor is like an application 
of mental massage which flushes out fatigue poisons and 
limbers one up all through. It lets loose the tensity of the 
mental currents. The mind seems to relax, straighten up 
from.its work, and take a long, fresh breath. 
(3)) Quiet but effective determination must keep the 
mental machine running smoothly, rousing us to kill off

Herman M. Adler.

some thoughts and feelings and promote othe ‘The 
curbing of a wish, when this means not only the check but 
the annihilation of the desire, isa noble exercise of inhibition. 
The denial of expression simultaneously with the continued 
entertainment of the wish is exceedingly hurtful. The 
frequent experience of emotions which do not secure any 
motor outlet is also abnormal. Anger may not lead to 
fighting, nor even to scolding, but it may be turned into 
a motive for vigorous action.” + 
Another large work for the will is that of breaking the 
monotony of the mental life. Changeless experience means 
mental ruin. There is an old story of a farmer who, 
mystified at his wife’s going insane, said she had nothing 
to bear, as she had “ scarcely stepped outside of her own 
kitchen for fifteen years!’’ But monotony is largely a 
matter of fatigue, which we shall discuss later. 
/ What ails the unhealthy mind ? — Health of mind means 
| (2) self-management and (2) adaptation to environment. Tf 
\a mind lacks either of these, it is regarded as unhealthy. 
his is indicated by the more modern term, ‘“ maladjus 
ment,”’ that is, bad adjustment, which is now being widely 
used in place of “ insanity.” The word insanity suggests 
an incurable terror. \ Maladjustment indicates, and truth- 
fully, a difficulty more or less common to man, and usually 
temporary. 
Two factors must always be considered, the native 
strength of any nervous system, and the strength of the 
stimuli brought to bear upon it. The normal nervous sys- 
tem is like a good mousetrap, set to react to stimuli of 
medium strength. Some traps (and nervous systems) are 
1 Percy Goldthwait Stiles, The Nervous System and Its Conservation, p. 171.
-P-A-G-E-299

too resistive, and refuse to respond even to strong stimuli. 
But much more commonly nervous systems are too sensi- 
tive, and “go off” at the slightest provocation. This 
gives us the neurasthenic, or “ nervous ” person. 
But the same nervous system may show, now a high, now 
a low resistance to stimuli. Some of the causes of nervous 
impairment (listed by Stiles) are poor nutrition, eye 
strain, bad teeth, nasal obstruction, or other peripheral 
derangement, bad air, the wrong kind of work, worry, clash 
of duties, personal antipathies due to lack of tolerance or 
good fellowship, repressed or unsatisfied desires of a serious 
nature, double-mindedness or indecision, excessive self- 
sacrifice. It is important to notice that peripheral derange- 
ments such as adenoids, catarrh, or bad teeth, may go on 
doing damage to the nervous system even after con- 
sciousness of pain or discomfort has ceased. 
Maladjustment during school days. — No.wonder we 
have so many nervous and troublesome children in school, 
and so many cases of neurasthenia or more serious mal- 
adjustment when school days are over. \ Psychiatrists tell 
us that fifty per cent of the insanity in the world is pre- 
ventable, and that much of it begins in childhood.) Of 
course, we can not expect teachers to turn into psychiatrists 
and spend their time diagnosing and treating abnormal 
children, but we can expect them to work forthe chief end 
of education, and that is often stated in the very terms here 
used, “ adjustment with t the environment.” We must do 
all in our power, then, to prevent maladjustment both in 
school and after. 
What signs shall we look for so as to recognize poor self- 
management or bad adaptation? Some of the symptoms,
-P-A-G-E-300
  300 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
especially those which may indicate future evil, are se- 
clusiveness, over-secretiveness, lack of frankness, moodiness, 
inability to get along with others and make friends; ex- 
cessive day-dreaming, brooding, foolish fancies, and im- 
possible plans; sensitiveness, touchiness, over-quickness 
at scenting insult or injury, harboring of resentment or 
unfounded suspicions; self-pity, great depression, self- 
depreciation; tendency to remain crushed if defeated, 
excessive indecision, great anxiety, timidity, fear, or worry ; 
sexual vagaries, and peculiar behavior of all sorts. 
As you read the list you are likely to feel that you have 
all the symptoms of future insanity. But, as said before, 
we are all a little queer — queer enough, let us hope, to 
make us sympathize with and help those who are seriously 
so. \ 
What can the teacher do? {The first, and perhaps the 
greatest thing he can do is to live a life of mental health 
in the presence of his pupils; to show them daily a living 
example of a big, strong, purposeful, well-poised, good- 
humored, sympathetic soul.} The old adage holds here again: 
as is the teacher, so is thé school.! That teacher is men- 
tally weak or ill who hates any pupil, who seeks revenge, 
or who uses his authority as a means of “ getting even” 
or of inflicting mental torture. If there is to be mental 
health in the school, some one must begin it. 
All treatment, says Hoch, consists in the application of 
two principles, rest and training. In other words, we must

the teacher is.” From a case reported in Dr. L. Pierce Clark’s Psychopathic

   MENTAL HYGIENE AND MENTAL EFFICIENCY 301 
weaken the stimuli, or strengthen the nervous system, or 
both. The teacher can apply the principle of rest by 
lightening school tasks, by keeping other children from 
persecuting the pupil, or even by advising the parents to 
remove the child from school for a time. 
With regard to training, Dr. Abbott’s advice applies 
excellently. We should begin, he says, when these traits 
first appear, during infancy, perhaps, and never cease 
our efforts, by every tactful and sympathetic means we 
can find, “ to get into the little mind,” to see things as the 
child sees them, and then, having learned to sympathize 
with him, to draw him gradually into sympathy with us 
and our healthful, objective, large-minded way of dealing 
with the world. To do this successfully, we must re- 
member that children’s minds, like flowers, grow and un- 
fold from within: we can not enlarge and form them from 
without.! 
Finally, our schools must not force the young to spend 
fatiguing years in purely academic training and then turn 
them loose in a world of grime and iron which is any- 
thing but academic. The very first aim of the school 
should be to help each pupil find that position in life where 
he can serve with greatest efficiency, pleasure, and ease 
of adjustment. 
Fatigue. — If we are to secure mental health and ef- 
ficiency for ourselves and our pupils, we must understand 
fatigue and its dangers. Unfortunately for our study, 
there are so many conflicting statements made about

E. Stanley Abbott, M. D., distributed by the National Committee for

  302 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
fatigue that whoever tries to reconcile them all is likely 
to know by experience, at least, what it is. 
Fatigue is reduced ability resulting from activity) 
Weariness is fatigue-feeling, often present when there is no 
real reduction of ability) Experiment shows that one 
may feel worse and worse weariness while his work grows 
better and better. On the other hand, weariness may be 
wanting when real exhaustion is approaching. There 
is a story — a true one — of an overwrought woman who, 
having asked advice of her physician, was told that she 
must rest. She replied that she was not tired and could 
not keep still. “Madam,” said the physician, “ you 
will have to lie down until you are tired and then rest.” 
Probably our fatigue-feelings are much like appetite, a 
rough and ready guide furnished by nature, to be followed 
at a distance, but to be carefully studied and regulated by 
reason. 
What happens in the body during fatigue? Energy is 
consumed, and poisons are formed which prevent our using 
the energy we have left. |If blood from a fatigued dog is 
injected into a fresh dog, the latter at once becomes 
eek) Poisons formed by the fatigue of any part are 
carried b¥ the blood to all parts: hence a walk may fatigue 
the arms, and brain work may fatigue the whole body. 
While there is such a thing as the special fatigue of a 
particular part, such fatigue never remains wholly isolated 
from other parts. 
Recovering from fatigue means, not only restoring used 
cell material, but flushing out the fatigue poisons so we can 
use the energy we have. Ifa frog’s muscle, dissected out 
from the body, is fatigued by electrical stimulation, the
-P-A-G-E-303
MENTAL HYGIENE AND MENTAL EFFICIENCY 303 
fatigue poisons can be washed out by injecting salt water 
into the blood vessels, after which the muscle will con- 
tract again as vigorously as ever. When, during vigorous 
exercise, we are compelled to breathe rapidly, it is not so 
much because we need to take oxygen in quickly as because 
we must throw fatigue poisons out rapidly. 
Bodily and mental fatigue.-+ Muscular exercise not ‘ 
only sends fatigue poisons to the brain, but also, if ex- 
cessive, withdraws blood from the brain. Mosso found 
that after pigeons had fatigued themselves by long flight, 
their brains were very pale and almost bloodless, strikingly 
different in color from those of pigeons in normal con- 
dition. /He thinks this explains why pigeons which have 
flown across from Africa to Italy can not see well when they 
arrive, and why we fail in our brain work attempted after 
fatigue! Such withdrawal of blood means a reduction of 
consciousness. 
What is the effect of mental work? 
Let us look at a curious fact. Those who die of starva- 
tion do not lose brain weight. All organs of the body are 
reduced, save heart and brain. Up to the very last, the 
heart gathers from every organ whatever energy the wast- 
ing cells of that organ can contribute to the blood stream 
and carries it to the brain to be consumed. A wonderful 
economy, truly, for if anything can save the perishing 
creature, it is a strong heart and a clear brain.? 
This enables us to understand Thorndike’s finding, that 
mder ordinary working conditions there is no such thing 
‘as mental fatigue of any practical consequence.} There may

2 See Mosso, op. cit., p. 285.
-P-A-G-E-304
  304, PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
be increased feelings of fatigue, but there is little if any de- 
crease in ability even after several hours of hard work. 
Both teacher and pupils, if they have the will to work, can 
do as much, in any subject, at one time of day as at an- 
other. Thorndike found the last half of the afternoon 
session a little better than the first half. All the facts, he 
thinks, point to the conclusion that the mental work done 
in an elementary school day does not at all reduce the 
ability to do mental work.! 
Thorndike has stamped his negative on several other 
current ideas also. He finds there is little or no “ initial 
spurt,” or “end spurt,” or “spurt after fatigue or dis- 
turbance,”’ no proof of rhythm of attention or other rhythm 
in work, no “ warming up” of any moment, no division 
of mental workers into “early fatiguing” and “ late 
fatiguing,” or the like. 
Signs of fatigue and weariness. — Many efforts have 
been made to measure mental fatigue, but all without 
success, as we should expect: for how can we commonly 
measure what is not commonly there? 
Nevertheless, mental work consumes the bodily sub- 
stance and produces a certain amount of fatigue poisons. 
This might enable us to get at the effect of brain work by 
such means as the ergograph, which is used to measure 
muscular fatigue. But there are complicating conditions. 
For example, if emotion accompanies the mental work, 
it may actually increase muscular power and reaction for 
a time. (See Ch. XIII.) The effect of fatigue varies 
much with individuals and circumstances. In general, 
however, the happy medium of sensitivity to stimuli and 
1 Edward L. Thorndike, Educational Psychology, Vol. III, p. 94.
-P-A-G-E-305
  MENTAL HYGIENE AND MENTAL EFFICIENCY 305 
of appropriate reaction which characterizes the normal 
nervous system, is raised to a too great irritability, or 
lowered into dullness and indifference. The individual 
either ‘“ goes off” too easily, or is too “dead” to respond 
at all. 
The teacher should practice the recognition of those 
pupils whose tissues are being consumed by too much work 
of brain or muscle. As indicated above, extremes of con- 
dition appear: the figure is either slouchy, with a constant 
tendency to seek support of some kind, or over tense; 
the gait drags or shows spasmodic quickness; the face is 
pale or carries a nervous flush, but is not healthily rosy; 
there may be much yawning and sleepiness, or insomnia ; 
ideas refuse to come at all or come with such a rush as to 
confuse utterance; the fatigued person may be pre- 
cipitate, fiery, and rude in dealing with others, or become 
too timid to meet them with comfort. Which of these 
opposite symptoms appear depends largely on the stage of 
fatigue. Fatigue poison, like alcohol, usually starts an 
increased liveliness, followed by depression. 
The eyelids often droop, the lines of the face turn down- 
ward, and the smile is forced or absent. Temperature 
may be high, and headache or tightening in the head is 
common, sometimes accompanied by palpitation of the 
heart, indigestion, and dizziness. Attention wanders from 
the lesson to the pupil’s own condition. He may work 
feverishly, with many errors, or slow down altogether. 
Training for efficiency. — First, what shall we do about 
fatigue? Avoid it. 
Let Mosso teach us again. He found that, by stopping 
frequently, when a muscle is only half fatigued, it can do
-P-A-G-E-306
  306 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
more than double the work it would perform if it worked 
on until exhausted. Muscles are not like machines which 
consume the same amount of fuel for each unit of work 
performed, no matter how long they run. When muscular 
fatigue has set in, even a moderate amount of work may 
cause results that are serious. (Op. cit., pp. 151, 152.) 
Even if there is no mental fatigue, no actual reduction 
of ability during ordinary working periods, yet the feed- 
ing of bodily energy into the brain during mental work 
probably (though not certainly) follows the laws of bodily 
fatigue. In the long run, the student can accomplish 
most with least expense by taking frequent short rests. 
Some of our more progressive manufacturers have con- 
cluded that they get largest returns frora their employees 
by allowing them ten minutes of every hour for rest. 
This would probably be a good rule for schools to adopt. 
And our rests should be devoted, in part at least, to deep 
breathing. Certainly, growing girls and boys should over- 
rest rather than overwork. 
Finally, what is the most efficient attitude for one to 
maintain toward his work during the working period? 
Thorndike’s phrase, “‘ peaceful absorption,’’ describes it 
perfectly. Both as teachers and learners, we must prac- 
tice the habit of putting out of mind everything but one 
thing, and encourage the feeling of ‘‘ This-one-thing-I-do.” 
“ The little child who complained ‘I am tired of not play- 
ing,’ expressed admirably one feature of fatigue. The 
strain of not giving way to certain tendencies to respond 
is as important as the strain of continuing certain others. 
Work in the popular sense is distinguisied from play or 
recreation less by the amount of positive action than by 
 
-P-A-G-E-307
  
MENTAL HYGIENE AND MENTAL EFFICIENCY 307 
the amount of restriction. We are fatigued by what we 
do not do.” 1 
What we want in our pupils and ourselves is a deep and 
quiet flow of energy. Altention we must have, but not 
tension, for that fatigues. And though lightning is 
spectacular, it really is very weak compared with the 
great voltage of electricity which modern industry has 
under quiet control. Nor should we try to start the rush- 
ing rapids of emotion, for it wears us much as muscular 
labor does. The deep water of absorbed interest runs 
still. 
When working in a group, the social spirit should pre- 
dominate, the feeling of friendliness. That teacher saves 
herself much fatigue who can throw off all stiffness and 
over-formality and teach as one who is enjoying a kindly 
conversation. 
CLASS EXERCISES 
I 
Working either individually, or in a group with the instructor, as 
he may direct, compile a body of rules designed to keep in a state of 
mental health any one who obeys them. 
Review these rules daily. for a week and try to put them into 
practice. At the end of the week, have reports made to the class as 
to the value of the plan, with a discussion of helps and hindrances. 
Would it be worth while to spend a few minutes meditating on 
these rules each day? 
II 
Visit a schoolroom and observe its general atmosphere with re- 
gard to mental health and efficiency. Should you like to remain there 
asa pupil? Why?

            308 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Do you discover any pettiness or tendency to nag, or is there large- 
ness and cordiality of spirit? Describe the attitude of the teacher 
toward his class. Does he seem well-poised mentally? Is he evi- 
dently under strain, or does he show signs of reserve power which 
may be tapped if necessary ? 
Do you think you can discover any very good or very bad mental 
habits? Any queer pupils? 
Do the pupils generally appear fatigued, or in good condition? 
Give evidences. 
Is there ‘‘ peaceful absorption ” in the work? If so, how is it se-

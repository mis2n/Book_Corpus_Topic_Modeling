PREFACE 
In this volume, intended primarily for use in English com- 
position classes, the selections have been chosen chiefly from 
the writings of college presidents and other educators with a 
view to covering some of the more important questions and 
problems of the student’s personal relation to the various 
aspects of college life—intellectual, athletic, and social. Such 
material has for the English composition course a twofold value. 
In the first place, material of this kind enables the student 
to receive at the beginning of his college career help in under- 
standing the college and his relation to it. The student is 
generally seriously lacking in proper knowledge of the funda- 
mental ideas involved in the college course he has entered upon 
—the ideas which are in fact necessary to insure success. He 
rarely has any conception of what the term liberal education 
means, or what combination of studies such an education de- 
mands; neither does he know the intellectual ideas that should 
dominate him as he pursues these studies; and he fails also in 
the utilization to the utmost of the incidental advantages which 
college life offers in its play and its social aspects.. The English 
composition course seems a logical place in which to give stu- 
dents that understanding of the educational and social interests 
of the college necessary to enable them to become good “college 
citizens.” 
A glance at the groupings in the table of contents shows the 
extent to which this volume attempts to cover the field of college 
life. About half of the material bears upon the college curric- 
ulum. The first group treats of the general function of the 
college in education; the second presents the two great branches 
of education, namely, science and art, and their contrasted 
claims; the third takes up the individual student’s selection of 
v

his program of study; and the next group presents some ideals 
of intellectual work. The remainder of the book deals with 
the student interests outside of the curriculum, such as general 
reading, recreation and athletics, college spirit, college morals, 
student government, etc. 
The second value that this material has for the course in 
English composition is that it enables the instructor to make 
the course incite to thinking and to intellectual expansion. In 
the composition course it seems wise to emphasize ideas, rather 
than literary models or set exercises, by allowing the student 
to encounter fresh and stimulating thoughts, which one may 
adopt and apply to one’s own experience, or which one may 
combat or modify in accordance with individual conviction. 
To throw the emphasis upon formal matters is unwise and is 
an illustration of what Huxley has described as making the 
student practice the use of knife, fork, and spoon without giving 
him a particle of meat. But if the student is provided before 
he writes with the materials of thought in the form of some 
reading which, firmly thought out and clearly expressed, stimu- 
lates to thinking, the ways and means of clear expression as- 
sume new significance to him. The field of college life offers 
many inviting subjects for writing and oral discussion which 
are well within the comprehension and experience of the student. 
The selections in this book are therefore intended as a body 
of stimulating material. Though suggestiveness in point of 
ideas has been the main criterion of choice, these selections 
will serve well also as models of clear, direct, and incisive mod- 
ern English. The selections have not been brought together 
for the purpose of representing the different types of discourse, 
but simply to set the student to the general task of correct and 
effective writing. It so happens, however, that these selections 
will readily serve as a basis for the expository and argumentative 
writing which, in most colleges, is the fundamental part of the 
first-year course in writing. The material in this book will be 
         
-P-A-G-E-5
      PREFACE vii 
found suited either for the work of a semester or of a whole 
session. 
The question of the method to be used in handling this 
material is one for each individual instructor to solve, and no 
attempt has been made by the editor to indicate an elaborate 
plan for using it. The underlying principles in his mind are first, 
the reading of the essays; second, the discussion of their leading 
thoughts; and third, the writing by the student on topics suggested 
by this reading and discussion. The free discussion is important 
because it produces an atmosphere of interested and clear 
thinking which aids greatly the writing of compositions. 
The tcpics for discussion and practice in writing given in con- 
nection with the selections are merely suggestive and should 
be freely modified as the needs of particular classes may dictate. 
One point, however, seems essential to success in this method. 
It is that in assigning exercises for writing the student should 
be given some one point to explain and illustrate or to criticise 
rather than a whole article to summarize and condense. The 
first is a stimulating and essentially original task, the second a 
dull and deadening one; the first demands thought, the second 
prohibits it. The more definitely the topic can be narrowed to 
a precise focus, the more suggestive it will prove to the thought- 
ful student and tend to become one upon which he can enlarge 
to the limits of his intellectual resources. 
Although due acknewledgments for permission to reprint 
the articles brought together in this book are scattered through 
its pages, it is pleasure here to record in a general way grateful 
appreciation of these generous permissions, and an obligation 
equally to the authors who have consented to this use of their 
writings and to the publishers who have graciously dismissed 
copyright restrictions. M. G. F.

    INTRODUCTION r 
This book is intended to help the student in his work in Eng- 
lish composition in two ways. In the first place, he may acquire 
from reading these selections a generous number of fresh and 
stimulating ideas on subjects of importance to the college man, 
and these ideas, adapted or applied to one’s own experience, or 
combated and modified in accordance with individual convic- 
tion, may be utilized as material for compositions and oral dis- 
cussions. In the second place, he may, by analysis of methods, 
become master of some of the fundamental procedures of good 
writing. As it is natural for the student to ask how he may go 
about obtaining these benefits, these two purposes—reading 
for ideas and analyzing for methods of writing—will be discussed 
in turn more fully. 
How to Reap For IpEAs! 
In order to acquire from these selections ideas for use in com- 
position writing, it is necessary to read with two qualities of 
mind—alertness and sympathy. Alertness is nothing but being 
awake and interested in what is read. The mind must be at 
work behind the eye that follows the print of the pages. Further- 
more, alertness is essentially an attitude of interrogation and 
judgment. That is, the student must put the ideas presented 
to him upon trial for their soundness and worth; he must 
uncover their merits and defects and pass judgment upon their 
general value. Many writers have emphasized the importance 
of such reading. Says Bacon in his essay, Of Studies, “Read 
not to . . . believe and take for granted, . . . but to weigh 
and consider.” “Every book,” says Lowell in his essay, Books 
and Libraries, ‘we read may be a round in the ever lengthening

   ladder by which we climb to knowledge, and to that temperance 
and serenity of mind which, as it is the ripest fruit of wsdom, 
is also the sweetest. But this can only be if we read such books 
as make us think, and read them in such a way as helps them 
to do so, that is, by endeavoring to judge them, and thus 
make them an exercise rather than a relaxation of mind. 
Desultory reading, except as conscious pastime, hebetates the 
brain and slackens the bow string of Will.” It is largely this 
interrogative mood that makes the difference between the idle 
absorber of print and the thinker. 
The result of this testing of ideas for soundness and worth 
will sometimes be agreement, sometimes disagreement. There 
is a common idea that acceptance is a far more easy and less 
aggressive act than rejection. The contrary, however, is 
probably true. To belief in the ease of acceptance is due the 
fact that so much acceptance, as for instance, of religious and 
political doctrines, is only nominal and not intelligent enough 
or critical enough to be genuine. Again, it is often declared 
that any one can find fault, but the recognition of merit is 
admitted to require insight. If this be true in other fields, it 
must also be true in regard to reading. Rejection, therefore, 
is no more aggressive or positive than acceptance; and if one of 
these calls for a more critical attitude and more mental energy, 
it is probably acceptance. 
Frequently the most profitable reading is that which irritates, 
that with which we disagree. But such reading must be done, 
not with scorn and aloofness, but with sympathy. The sym- 
pathetic mind desires to ascertain exactly what the writer thinks 
and why, even though his ideas may be contrary to what one 
can accept. Carlyle has called our attention to the importance 
of this quality of sympathy in the following passage: “We 
have not read an author till we have seen his object, whatever 
it may be, as he saw it. Is it a matter of reasoning, and has he 
reasoned stupidly and falsely? We should understand the cir- 
cumstances which, to his mind, made it seem true, or persuaded 
him to write it.” 
The result of reading done with alertness of mind and sym-

INTRODUCTION xiii 
pathy should be stimulation of the mental energies. It is such 
reading as this that Emerson meant to describe by the phrase, 
“creative reading”. when in his American Scholar Address he 
said, “One must be an inventor to read well. As the proverb 
says, ‘He that would bring home the wealth of the Indies must 
carry out the wealth of the Indies.’ There is then creative 
reading as well as creative writing. When the mind is braced 
by labor and invention, the page of whatever book we read 
becomes luminous with manifold allusion, Every sentence is 
doubly significant, and the sense of our author is broad as the 
world.” Emerson simply means that thoughtful men cannot 
sit over the printed page which exhibits the workings of a power- 
ful mind without being excited, moved, and made to feel that 
they can and will do something in the expression of their 
thoughts. This same attitude is presented in the saying, “A 
German professor never reads a book except with the design 
of writing another.” It is this stimulation to thought and to 
expression of thought that these selections are intended to 
give. 
As an essential part of the student’s profit from this reading, 
there should be the expression of thought. Thought without ex- 
pression is, as every one knows, very indefinite and it is only when 
we think our thoughts out into words that we seem really to have 
thoughts. Furthermore, this clarifying of our own minds by 
attempts at expression provides us with surer ground on which 
to build new thoughts. Thus every time we try to express our- 
selves faithfully, we make the outlines of our own lives more 
distinct and create further opportunities for new activities. 
This relation of thought and expression is well set forth in the 
words of Channing from his Remarks on National Literature: 
“We doubt whether a man ever brings his faculties to bear with 
their whole force on a subject until he writes upon it for the 
instruction and gratification of others. To place it clearly 
before others, he feels the necessity of viewing it more vividly 
himself. By attempting to seize his thoughts, and fix them in 
an enduring form, he finds them vague and unsatisfactory to 
a degree which he did not suspect, and toils for a precision and
-P-A-G-E-12
  xiv COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
harmony of views of which he had never before felt the need. 
He places his subject in new lights,—submits it to a searching 
analysis, compares and connects it with his various knowledge, 
seeks for it new illustrations and analogies, weighs objections, 
and through these processes often arrives at higher truths than 
he at first aimed to illustrate. . . . The laborious distribution of 
a great subject, so as to assign to each part or topic its just posi- 
tion and due proportion, is singularly fitted to give compass and 
persevering force of thought.” 
How to ANALYZE FoR MEtTHops oF WRITING 
One of the best ways of acquiring skill in composition is to 
go, as it were, into the workshop of successful writers, and see 
how they use their tools, and then try to use these tools as best 
wecan. This might be called the method of analysis and imi- 
tation. On the side of analysis, we watch how the work has 
been done in order to see the processes, in sentence, paragraph, 
and longer work, by which the writer has digested his material, 
shaped it for eye of the reader, presented it to the best advantage, 
and said what he had to say in direct and incisive style. Thus 
the student comes to possession of a valuable set of procedures 
to help him in the expression of his own ideas. On the side of 
imitation, we do not try as Stevenson did in his famous method 
of learning to write, to imitate the thing itself, but simply to 
apply observed principles to our own writing. This is not mere 
slavish copying. It is learning the difficult art of writing from 
many masters in turn, absorbing the processes of each of them, 
assimilating their methods, and at last finding out how to be 
one’s self. It is true of this method of imitation that “The only 
way not to copy anybody is to study everybody. There is 
safety in numbers so far as originality is concerned.” 
To assist in this rhetorical study the following suggestive 
scheme for the examination of a selection is given. 
1See the essay “College Memories” in Stevenson’s Memories and Portraits. Also, on this subject of the necessity of imitation as a means of learning to write, see Brander 
Matthews’ The Duty of Imitation, Outlook, Vol. 97, page 77 (January 14, rgrr).

INTRODUCTION xv 
PLAN FOR THE RHETORICAL STUDY OF* SELECTIONS 
ORGANIZATION 
The ideal of any well written composition has)been aptly 
expressed by Pater in his Essay on Style as “that architectural 
conception of the work which perceives the end in the beginning 
and never loses sight of\it, and in every part is conscious of all 
the rest, till the last sentence does but, with undiminished vigor, 
unfold and justify the first.” Pater means that every good 
composition must have its material carefully syStematized and 
organized and all its parts skilfully adjusted to each other and 
the whole. In other words, a composition is not a haphazard ‘ 
collection of miscellaneous ideas or observations, but an orderly 
presentation of thoughts, each of which is rélated to all of the 
others in a reasonable and ‘necessary way, and all ‘combining 
to make the meaning of the larger whole complete and satisfy- 
ing. d 
it is evident that the first step toward good, composition is to 
have a main idea upon which to focus all the Subordinate ideas. 
This main idea will determine the selection of material, com- YW 
pelling the rejection of material that does not help in the develop-. 
ment of the main thought. 
State the substance of the selection under study in a short 
concise sentence. Has the writer introduced materialyat any 
point that does bear directly upon this main point, the presence 
of which tends to confuse the reader? Are any important 
matters bearing upon the subject omitted? Does the writer 
seem to have stopped halfway in developing any part of his — 
discussion? . 
The Beginning.—The beginning is one of the most important 
parts of a composition. The older writers made use of formal 
introductions, but modern writers follow the fixed rule: Begin 
promptly, even if you have.to plunge abruptly into your subject. Focus.—From what, has been! just said hous organization, Ae 4

  xvi COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
A good beginning catches the attention of the reader at once, 
and directs it as soon as possible toward the writer’s end. 
Does the selection open with a formal introduction? Is there 
need of such an introduction? If the introduction is consider- 
ably reduced, consider whether the selection begins too abruptly. 
Do the first paragraphs state the main thought of the slection? 
Do they indicate the sub-divisions which this main idea in- 
cludes? 
Order of Topics—The main thought of a composition be- 
ing generally too extended to be discussed all at once, it is 
divided by the writer into such parts as he can most clearly 
build. up one by one into a connected whole. The question of 
order of presentation becomes then very important. The pre- 
cise order of these parts in any given composition depends upon 
the subject and the conditions under which it is treated, but | 
method of some kind there must be. 
Carefully determine the main points of the selection being 
studied, and write them consecutively so that they will consti- 
tute an outline of the selection. Is the order the best for clear- 
ness and logic? 
Obvious Structure—Not only must the topics of the com- 
position be arranged in good order, but indication should be 
given the reader whenever one topic is finished and another 
taken up. One way of doing this is to shape every division of 
a composition so that the end of it will suggest what is to follow. 
‘Under this method, explicit indication of transition is not 
necessary. But as this plan is sometimes impossible or unde- 
sirable, transition from one part to another is made by means of 
some word, or phrase, or sentence of backward reference placed 
at or near the beginning of the new part. 
Find the important transitional and summarizing passages 
in the selection. Has the framework of the selection been made 
too evident?
-P-A-G-E-15
    
INTRODUCTION xvii 
Proportion and Emphasis—As not all of the minor divisions 
of a composition bear with the same degree of directness or 
importance upon the complete development of the whole com- 
position, it is necessary for the writer in order to have his com- 
position a finished and symmetrical structure, with no part 
given undue emphasis or prominence, and no part slighted, to 
make clear those ideas which are relatively more important. 
This can be done either by devoting extra space to the topics 
to be emphasized, or by putting them in the conspicuous posi- 
tions of the composition,—the beginning and the end. 
Is the material of the selection well proportioned? What 
topic received the fullest treatment? Determine if possible 
the reason. 
The End.—The end is as important as the beginning. Like 
the beginning, it should not be extended and formal. It may 
be of any one of many types. A very useful form is that which 
summarizes and enforces the main thought. The one unpar- 
donable defect in a conclusion is to blur or weaken what precedes. 
What is the nature of the conclusion of the selection under 
study? How effective isit? Could you suggest a better one? 
DETAILS OF ORGANIZATION 
Passing to the smaller features of a composition, we find that 
the governing principles are in the main the same that apply to 
the composition as a whole and to the larger features. Here, too, 
the most important matter is arrangement and organization. 
The Paragraph—Obvious structure necessarily involves 
careful paragraphing. In following the course of thought the 
mind wearies, and it is important that there should be halting 
places—points indicated where the reader may feel that a cer- 
tain stage of the development of the thought has been completed, 
and where he may take breath, so to speak, before passing on to 
another. Hence paragraphing is an important element in  
-P-A-G-E-16
xviii COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
successful composition. The paragraph divisions should not 
be arbitrary nor accidental, but should correspond to some 
natural and logical grouping of thought. Each paragraph 
should contain only such material as is logically justifiable as 
a unit by itself. The fundamental principle of the inner struc- 
ture of the paragraph is therefore unity. It must have one 
central thought to which all the ideas making up the develop- 
ment of the paragraph shall be properly subordinated. The 
question of long or short paragraphs must be determined largely 
by the capacity of the reader. If he lacks the power of grasping 
large and complicated wholes, the tendency of the paragraphs 
should be toward shortness; if, on the other hand, the reader has 
this power, the paragraphs may with advantage be much longer, 
for such a reader would probably find short paragraphs jerky, 
confusing, and ineffective. Between the parts of a paragraph 
there should be a flow of thought; in other words, connection. 
This is accomplished sometimes by means of link-words between 
the sentences of the paragraph, but often the relation of the 
ideas themselves is clear enough without explicit expression, 
particularly if they follow in the right order, and when this is 
the case connecting-links are unnecessary. The end of the 
paragraph is important as a place for bringing home the central 
idea of the paragraph. 
How many main points in this selection? Does the para- 
graphing correspond to these main topics; that is, is there an 
equal number of paragraphs and main topics? Give reasons 
for any disparity you may find in this matter. Test some of the 
paragraphs for unity by seeing whether the gist of the para- 
graph can be given in a brief sentence. Has the writer himself 
formulated the leading ideas of his paragraphs in topic-sentences 
appearing in the paragraphs? Make outlines of a few para- 
graphs to determine whether the various details mentioned are 
arranged upon a preconceived plan or left to haphazard. Point 
out the words in the various sentences of the paragraph that 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
INTRODUCTION xix 
connect with what is before or after. Are the paragraphs 
closely related and how are they bound together? 
The Sentence——Success in sentence making requires the 
endeavor to do three things:—(1) to make the sentence clear 
in itself; (2) to make it strong in relation to its neighbors in the 
paragraph; and (3) to give variety of cadence to the series of 
sentences making up the paragraph. However long or complex 
the sentence may be, it should embody but one central thought. 
There may be, of course, codrdinate and subordinate ideas, but 
there must be sufficient attraction between these for them to be 
taken together as one complete thought. A common cause 
of poor sentences is the writer’s failure to indicate the proper 
subordination of the related ideas. Generally this arises 
from the overuse of codrdinating conjunctions and the conse- 
quent frequency of the compound type of sentence. By taking 
advantage of the plentiful supply of devices in English for indi- 
cating various shades of relationship between ideas, the writer 
should convert these improper compound sentences into com- 
plex sentences that really represent the relationship of the 
thoughts grouped together and which therefore makes a stronger 
impression of unity. Some words carry more of the thought 
of the sentence than others. Clearness requires that the writer 
make these words stand out so that the reader cannot miss 
them. The beginning of the sentence is a place of emphasis 
and should be occupied by an important idea. But the con- 
clusion is an even more emphatic position, because the close 
of the sentence is the point where the reader grasps the meaning 
of what he reads completely. The peculiar structure of the 
" periodic sentence which holds the thought in abeyance until the _ 
close of the sentence makes this type of sentence distribute its 
emphasis better than the loose type. The two characteristics 
of balanced sentences—parallel structure and antithesis or 
contrast—give a type of sentence which is likely to have a 
well-woven coherence of parts. 
Every sentence serves a double purpose; it has a meaning of 
its own, and it helps to make clearer the meaning of some other
-P-A-G-E-18
XxX COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
sentence. Each sentence, therefore, must be considered in its 
relation to other sentences. By means of relation of words 
and other devices of connection, it must be adjusted to its 
neighbors. Sentences must be considered in connection with 
surrounding sentences for the sake not only of clearness, but 
also of variety. In the best writers is to be found a constant 
variation in sentence structure which secures the important 
aid of novelty. The reader’s attention is roused at every turn 
by some new arrangement of clause, different length or com- 
plexity of sentence, change in the places of stress, and the like. 
A brief, simple, direct sentence will be followed by a slightly 
more complex one, and this by another .in which involution of 
subordinated clauses is carried to a considerable degree. It 
is important to note that when this variety is at its best, it is 
not a mere haphazard avoidance of monotony but a variety in 
unity. To the untrained writer sentences are likely to seem 
hard, crystallized affairs so that once a thought has taken form 
in words, it seems practically impossible to change it. The 
experienced writer, however, knows that a sentence is easier to 
twist and turn than a rubber band. He can change its shape, 
twist it about, divide it, join it with another, do what he will 
with it. To be infinitely various is one of the secrets of effect- 
ive style so far as the sentences are concerned. 
Does the writer- tend to use very short sentences, very long 
ones, or those of moderate length? Are his sentences loose or 
periodic? Do many sentences show the use of parallelism? 
Does he give his sentences good emphasis? Does he seem to 
seek variety in his sentences? Is there a rhythm or cadence to 
- the sentences in any part? 
Vocabulary.—Words are the ultimate elements of speech. 
So important is careful study of them that style has been defined 
as consisting of right words in the right place, and this definition 
is correct if taken with its implications. No one can write 
effectively unless his vocabulary possesses three fundamental 
characteristics: (z) exactness, (2) suggestiveness, and (3) pro-
-P-A-G-E-19
    INTRODUCTION xxi 
priety. The exact word is the word which expresses with pre- 
cision the writer’s meaning. Most often the exact word is the 
specific word, that is, the word that is narrow inits range. The 
specific word has a double advantage: it forces the writer to 
realize exactly what his idea is and so to avoid vagueness from 
careless thinking; it presents the idea more effectively to the 
reader by stirring him to think in concrete images rather than 
in abstractions. Suggestiveness in diction is the power to stir 
the imagination. As has just been pointed out, this is a quality 
which specific words possess. It is also possessed by familiar 
words on account of their greater connotative value. Figures of 
speech are often serviceable and vital means of giving suggest- 
iveness to one’s writing, provided they are not lugged in for 
the sake of mere adornment. Propriety is concerned with 
good form in words. Much has been written about various 
violations of propriety, such as provincialisms, colloquialisms, 
slang, neologisms, “fine writing,” poetic diction, and the like, but 
most questions that arise under this head will be rendered easy 
of solution if we remember the basis of the fundamental law 
of usage in language. Language is a social product. Correct- 
ness in language is not like keeping the moral law or the laws of 
the state, but like dressing properly or behaving properly. 
Violations of usage in language are like violations of other 
social usages—in the main offenses against custom and good 
taste. 
A person’s choice of words is also, as in the case of other 
social usages, taken as an index to character and to mentality. 
It therefore behooves one to select his words with care, and to 
establish for himself a good usage, free from faulty grammar 
and an excessively local or slang diction. Furthermore, words 
and expressions that are perfectly fit for one occasion and pur- 
pose may be in bad taste for others. ‘“‘A man of taste and 
ability will modify his use of language to meet the special 
requirements of the task proposed. He will have learned by 
study to distinguish between different tones and values in the 
instrument of speech, and will have acquired by exercise the 
power of touching the mighty organ of expression to various

they mainly ornamental or do they clarify the thought?

    PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 
WHAT IS A COLLEGE FOR?! 
Wooprow WILson 
[Woodrow Wilson (1856——) was, before becoming President of the 
United States in 1913, a prominent educator. He had held professorships, 
in history and politics at Bryn Mawr, Wesleyan and Princeton, and from 
1907 to 1912 was president of Princeton. The selection here given, although 
a part of what was published originally as a magazine article, gives sub- 
stantially the same ideas regarding the aims of the college which were 
expressed toward the close of his career as a college president in several 
notable addresses on various academic occasions.] 
It may seem singular that at this time of day and in this 
confident century it should be necessary to ask, What is a 
college for? But it has become necessary. I take it for 
granted that there are few real doubts concerning the question 
in the minds of those who look at the college from the inside 
and have made themselves responsible for the realization of 
its serious purposes; but there are many divergent opinions held 
concerning it by those who, standing on the outside, have pon- 
dered the uses of the college in the life of the country; and their 
many varieties of opinion may very well have created a confusion 
of counsel in the public mind. 
They are, of course, entirely entitled to their independent 
opinions and have a right to expect that full consideration will 
be given what they say by those who are in fact responsible. 
The college is for the use of the nation, not for the satisfaction 
of those who administer it or for the carrying out of their private 
views. They may speak as experts and with a very intimate 
knowledge, but they also speak as servants of the country and

must be challenged to give reasons for the convictions they 
entertain. Controversy, it may be, is not profitable in such 
matters, because it is so easy, in the face of opposition, to becomé 
a partisan of one’s own views and exaggerate them in seeking 
to vindicate and establish them; but an explicit profession of. 
faith cannot fail to clear the air, and to assist the thinking both 
of those who are responsible and of those who only look on and 
seek to make serviceable comment. 
Why, then, should a man send his son to college when school 
is finished; or why should he advise any youngster in whom 
he is interested to go to college? What does he expect and 
desire him to get there? The question might be carried back 
and asked with regard to the higher schools also to which lads 
resort for preparation for college. What are they meant to get 
there? But it will suffice to center the question on the college. 
What should a lad go to college for,—for work, for the realiza- 
tion of a definite aim, for discipline and a severe training of his 
faculties, or for relaxation, for the release and exercise of his 
social powers, for the broadening effects of life in a sort of mini- 
ature world in which study is only one among many interests? 
That is not the only alternative suggested by recent discussions. 
They also suggest a sharp alternative with regard to the charac- 
ter of the study the college student should undertake. Should 
he seek at college a general discipline of his faculties, a general 
awakening to the issues and interests of the modern world, or 
should he, rather, seek specially and definitely to prepare him- 
self for the work he expects to do after he leaves college, for 
his support and advancement in the world? The two alterna- 
tives are very different. The one asks whether the lad does 
not get as good a preparation for modern life by being manager 
of a football team with a complicated, program of inter- 
collegiate games and trips away from home as by becoming 
proficient in mathematics or in history and mastering the ab- 
stract tasks of the mind; the other asks whether heis not better pre- 
pared by being given the special skill and training of a particular 
calling or profession, an immediate drill in the work he is to do 
after he graduates, than by being made a master of his own mind      
-P-A-G-E-25
  PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 3 
in the more general fields of knowledge to which his subsequent 
calling will be related, in all probability, only as every under- 
-faking is related to the general thought and experience of the 
world. 
“Learning” is not involved. No one has ever dreamed of 
imparting learning to undergraduates. It cannot be done in four 
syears. To become a man of learning is the enterprise of a life- 
time. The issue does not rise to that high ground. The ques- 
tion is merely this: do we wish college to be, first of all and 
chiefly, a place of mental discipline or only a school of general 
experience; and, if we wish it to be a place of mental discipline, 
of what sort do we wish the discipline to be,—a general awak- 
ening and release of the faculties, or a preliminary initiation 
into the drill of a particular vocation? 
These are questions which go to the root of the matter. 
They admit of no simple and confident answer. Their roots 
spring out of life and all its varied sources. To reply to them, 
therefore, involves an examination of modern life and an assess- 
ment of the part an educated man ought to play in it,—an an- 
alysis which no man may attempt with perfect self-confidence. 
The life of our day is a very complex thing which no man can 
pretend to comprehend in its entirety. 
But some things are obvious enough concerning it. There 
is an uncommon challenge to effort in the modern world, and 
all the achievements to which it challenges are uncommonly 
difficult. Individuals are yoked together in modern enterprise 
by a harness which is both new and inelastic. The man who 
understands only some single process, some single piece of work 
which he has been set to do, will never do anything else, and 
is apt to be deprived at almost any moment of the opportunity 
to do even that, because processes change, industry undergoes 
instant revolutions. New inventions, fresh discoveries, altera- 
tions in the markets of the world throw accustomed methods 
and the men who are accustomed to them out of date and use 
without pause or pity. The man of special skill may be changed 
into an unskilled laborer overnight. Moreover, it is a day in 
which no enterprise stands alone or independent, but is related 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  4 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
to every other and feels changes in all parts of the globe. The 
men with mere skill, with mere technical knowledge, will be 
mere servants perpetually, and may at any time become use- 
less servants, their skill gone out of use and fashion. The par- 
ticular thing they do may become unnecessary or may be so 
changed that they cannot comprehend or adjust themselves to 
the change. 
These, then, are the things the modern world must have in 
its trained men, and I do not know where else it is to get them 
if not from its educated men and the occasional self-developed 
genius of an exceptional man here and there. It needs, at the 
top, not a few, but many men with the power to organize and 
guide. The eolleee is meant to stimulate in a considerable 
number of men what would be stimulated in only a few if we 
were to depend entirely upon nature and circumstance.: Below 
the ranks of generalship and guidance, the modern world needs 
for the execution of its varied and difficult business a very much 
larger number of men with great capacity and readiness for the 
apid and concentrated exertion of a whole series of faculties: 
planning faculties as well as technical skill, the ability to handle 
men as well as to handle tools and correct processes, faculties 
of adjustment and adaptation as well as of precise execution,— 
men of resource as well as knowledge) These are the athletes, 
the athletes of faculty, of which our generation most stands in 
need. All through its ranks, besides, it needs masterful men 
who can acquire a working knowledge of many things readily, 
quickly, intelligently, and with exactness,— things they had not 
foreseen or prepared themselves for beforehand, and for which. - 
they could not have prépared themselves beforehand. Quick , 
apprehension, quick comprehension, quick action are what 
modern life puts a premium upon,—a readiness to turn this 
way or that and not lose force or momentum. 
To me, then, the question seems to be, Shall the lad who 
goes to college go there for the purpose of getting ready to be a 
servant merely, a servant who will be nobody and who may be- 
come useless, or shall he go there for the purpose of getting ready 
to be a master adventurer in the field of modern opportunity? *
-P-A-G-E-27
  PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 5 
We must expect hewers of wood and drawers of water to 
come out of the colleges in their due proportion, of course, but 
I take it for granted that even the least gifted of them did 
not go to college with the ambition to be nothing more. And yet 
one has hardly made the statement before he begins to doubt 
whether he.can safely take anything for granted. Part of the 
very question we are discussing is the ambition with which 
young men now go to college. It is a day when a college course 
has become fashionable,—but not for the purpose of learning, 
not for the purpose of obtaining a definite preparation for any- 
thing——no such purpose could become fashionable. The 
clientage of our colleges has greatly changed since the time 
when most of the young men who resorted to them did so 
with a view to entering one or other of the learned professions. 
Young men who expect to go into business of one kind or 
‘another now outnumber among our undergraduates those who 
expect to make some sort of learning the basis of their work. 
throughout life; and I dare say that they generally go to col- 
lege without having made any very definite analysis of their aim 
nd purpose in going. Their parents seem to have made as little. 
; The enormous increase of wealth in the country in recent 
" years, too, has had its effect upon the colleges,—not in the 
way that might have been expected,—not, as yet, by changing 
the standard of life to any very noticeable extent or intro- 
ducing luxury and extravagance and vicious indulgence. Col- 
lege undergraduates have usually the freshness of youth about 
them, out of which there springs a wholesome simplicity, and 
it is not easy to spoil them or to destroy their natural democracy. 
They make a life of their own and insist upon the maintenance 
of its standards. But the increase of wealth has brought into 
the colleges, in rapidly augmenting numbers, the sons of very 
rich men, and lads who expect to inherit wealth are not as 
easily stimulated to effort, are not as apt to form definite and 
serious purposes, as those who know that they must whet their 
wits for the struggle of life. 
There was a time when the mere possession of wealth con- 
-ferred distinction; and-when wealth confers distinction it.is apt
-P-A-G-E-28
    
6 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
to breed a sort of consciousness of opportunity and responsibility 
in those who possess it and incline them to seek serious achieve- 
ment. But that time is long past in America. Wealth is com- 
mon. And, by the same token, the position of the lad who is 
to inherit it is a peculiarly disadvantageous one, if the standard 
of success is to rise above mediocrity. Wealth removes the 
necessity for effort, and yet effort is necessary for the attain- 
ment of distinction, and very great effort at that, in the modern 
world, as I have already pointed out. It would look as if the 
ordinary lad with expectations were foredoomed to obscurity; 
for the ordinary lad will not exert himself unless he must. 
We live in an age in which no achievement is to be cheaply 
had. All the cheap achievements, open to amateurs, are ex- 
hausted and have become commonplace. Adventure, for ex- 
ample, is no longer extraordinary: which is another way of 
saying that it is commonplace. Any amateur may seek and 
find adventure; but it has been sought and had in all its kinds. 
Restless men, idle men, chivalrous men, men drawn on by mere 
curiosity and men drawn on by love of the knowledge that lies 
outside books and laboratories, have crossed the whole face of 
the habitable globe in search of it, ferreting it out in corners 
even, following its bypaths and beating its coverts, and it is 
nowhere any longer a novelty or distinction to have discovered 
and enjoyed it. The whole round of pleasure, moreover, has 
been exhausted time out of mind, and most of it discredited 
as not pleasure after all, but just an expensive counterfeit; so 
that many rich people have been driven to devote themselves 
to expense regardless of pleasure. No new pleasure, I am cred- 
ibly informed, has been invented within the memory of man. 
For every genuine thrill and satisfaction, therefore, we are ap- 
parently, in this sophisticated world, shut in to work, to modi- 
fying and quickening the life of the age. If college be one of 
the highways to life and achievement, it must be one of the 
highways to work. 
The man who comes out of college into the modern world 
must, therefore, have got out of it, if he has not wasted four 
vitally significant years of his life, a quickening and a training
-P-A-G-E-29
  PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 7 
which will make him in some degree a master among men. If 
he has got less, college was not worth his while. To have 
made it worth his while he must have got such a preparation 
and development of his faculties as will give him movement as 
well as mere mechanical efficiency in affairs complex, difficult, 
and subject to change. The word efficiency has in our day the 
power to think at the center of it, the power of independent 
movement and initiative. It is not merely the suitability to 
be a good tool, it is the power to wield tools, and among the 
tools are men and circumstances and changing processes of 
industry, changing phases of life itself. There should be tech- 
nical schools a great many and the technical schools of America 
should_be among the best in’ the world. The men they train 
are indispensable. The modern world needs more tools than 
managers, more workmen than master workmen. But even 
the technical schools must have some thought of mastery and 
adaptability in their procésses; and the colleges, which are not 
technical schools, should think of that chiefly. We must dis- 
tinguish what the college is for, without disparaging any other 
school, of any other kind. It is for the training of the men 
who are to rise above the ranks. ‘ 
That is what a college is for. What it does, what it requires 
of its undergraduates and of its teachers, should be adjusted 
to that conception. The very statement of the object, which 
must be plain to all who make any distinction at all between 
a college and a technical school, makes it evident that the col- 
lege must subject its men to a general intellectual training 
which will be narrowed to no one point of view, to no one 
vocation or calling. It must release and quicken as many facul- 
ties of the mind as possible,—and not only release and quicken 
them but discipline and strengthen them also by putting them 
to the test of systematic labor. Work, definite, exacting, long 
continued, but not narrow or petty or merely rule of thumb, 
must be its law of life for those who would pass its gates and 
go out with its authentication. 
By a general training I do not mean vague spaces of study, 
miscellaneous fields of reading, a varied smattering of a score
-P-A-G-E-30
  8 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
of subjects and the thorough digestion of none. {The field of 
modern knowledge is extremely wide and varied. After a 
certain number of really fundamental subjects have been studied 
in the schools, the college undergraduate must be offered a 
choice of the route he will travel in carrying his studies further. 
He cannot be shown the whole body of knowledge within a 
single curriculum. There is no longer any single highway of 
learning. The roads that traverse its vast and crowded spaces 
are not even parallel, and four years is too short a time in 
which to search them all out. But there is a general pro- 
gram still possible by which the college student can be made 
acquainted with the field of modern learning by sample, by 
which he can be subjected to the several kinds of mental dis- 
cipline,—in philosophy, in some one of the great sciences, in some 
one of the great languages which carry the thought of the world, 
in history and in politics, which is its framework,—which will 
give him valid naturalization as a citizen of the world of thought, 
the world of educated men,—and no smatterer merely, able 
barely to spell its constitution out, but a man who has really 
comprehended and made use of its chief intellectual processes 
and is ready to_lay his mind alongside its tasks with some 
confidence that_he can master them and can understand why 
and how they are tobe performed. This is the general training 
which should be characteristic of the college, and the men 
who undergo it ought to be made to undergo it with deep 
seriousness and diligent labor; not as soft amateurs with whom 
learning and its thorough tasks are side interests merely, but 
as those who approach life with the intention of becoming 
professionals in its fields of achievement. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. From your acquaintance with mature persons, what estimates 
of the value of college training have you heard? What criticisms 
of the efficiency of college training have come under your notice? 
2. From your experience with your fellow-students and your general 
knowledge, enumerate some of the motives that lead students to go 
to college. Which of these should be regarded as proper motives 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  
  PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE : 9 
and which as improper? 3. Question yourself searchingly in réspect 
to your own motives. Why did you come to college? Have you a 
clear idea of what you are seeking here? Will the motive bear 
scrutiny? 4. Specify what you think the college should do for 
the student in training him for work, for play, and for social living. 
5. Does your experience in college life attest the truth of the writer’s 
statement in regard to the undue importance attached to the “side 
shows,” as he calls student diversions? What do you think ‘is the 
place and value of this phase of college life? Do these matters seem 
to have in your institution an injurious effect upon scholarship? 
6. With the aid of a large dictionary, find the history of the word 
“college,”’ and trace the steps by which the term, originally belong- 
ing to Roman law, has been transferred to educational usage. 7. Dis- 
tinguish between the college and the university; between the college 
and the technical school. 8. Is a college training more necessary at 
the present time for success in professions such as the ministry, 
teaching, law, medicine, scientific investigations, and in engineering 
than in the past? Ifso, why? 
KNOWLEDGE VIEWED IN RELATION TO LEARNING ! 
Joun Henry, CARDINAL NEWMAN 
{John Henry, Cardinal Newman (1801—1890), was a distinguished English 
theologian and writer. For a time he was identified with the so-called 
Oxford Movement in the Church of England, but after severe self-scrutiny 
he turned to the Church of Rome asa refuge from the religious unrest of his 
age. Possessed of one of the most keen and subtle intellects of his age, 
Newman was also master of an English style of marvelous beauty and 
power. This selection is one of a series of addresses given before the Uni- 
versity of Dublin and addressed primarily to Catholic educators] 
}t were well if the English, like the Greek language, pos- 
sessed some definite word to express, simply and generally, 
intellectual proficiency or perfection, such as “health,” as 
used with reference to the animal frame, and “virtue,” with 
reference to our moral nature. I am not able to find such a

term;—talent, ability, genius, belong distinctly to the raw 
material, which is the subject-matter, not to that excellence 
which is the result of exercise and training. When we turn, 
indeed, to the particular kinds of intellectual perfection, words 
are forthcoming for our purpose, as, for instance, judgment, 
taste, and skill; yet even these belong, for the most part, to 
powers or habits bearing upon practice or upon art, and not 
to any perfect condition of the intellect, considered in itself. 
Wisdom, again, is certainly a more comprehensive word than 
any other, but it has a direct relation to conduct, and to human 
life. Knowledge, indeed, and Science express purely intellectual 
ideas, but still not a state or quality of the intellect; for 
knowledge, in its ordinary sense, is but one of its circumstances, 
denoting a possession or a habit; and science has been 
appropriated to the subject-matter of the intellect, instead of 
belonging in English, as it ought to do, to the intellect itself. 
The consequence is that, on an occasion like this, many words 
are necessary, in order, first, to bring out and convey what 
surely is no difficult idea in itself,—that of the cultivation of 
the intellect as an end; next, in order to recommend what 
surely is no unreasonable object; and lastly, to describe and 
make the mind realize the particular perfection in which that 
object consists. Every one knows practically what are the 
constituents of health or of virtue; and every one recognizes 
health and virtue as ends to be pursued; it is otherwise with in- 
tellectual excellence, and this must be my excuse, if I seem to any 
one to be bestowing a good deal of labor on a preliminary matter. 
In default of a recognized term, I have called the perfection 
or virtue of the intellect by the name of philosophy, philosoph- 
ical knowledge, enlargement of mind, or illumination; terms 
which are not uncommonly given to it by writers of this day; 
but, whatever name we bestow on it, it is, I believe, as a matter 
of history, the business of a University ' to make this intellectual 
culture its direct scope, or to employ itself in the education 
of the intellect,—just as the work of a Hospital lies in healing 
1In England, the terms university and college are not differentiated in meaning as in the United States. Newman’s use of the word university may be regarded as equivalent to the American use of college.

the sick or wounded, of a Riding or Fencing School, or of a 
Gymnasium, in exercising the limbs, of an Almshouse, in 
aiding and solacing the old, of an Orphanage, in protecting 
innocence, of a Penitentiary, in restoring the guilty. I say,a 
University, taken in its bare idea, and before we view it as an 
instrument of the Church, has this object and this mission; it 
contemplates neither moral impression nor mechanical produc- 
tion; it professes to exercise the mind neither in art nor in 
duty; its function is intellectual culture, here it may leave its 
scholars, and it has done its work when it has done as much as 
this. It educates the intellect to reason well in all matters, 
to reach out towards truth, and to grasp it. 
I 
This, I said in my foregoing Discourse, was the object 
of a University, viewed in itself, and apart from the Catholic 
Church, or from the State, or from any other power which 
may use it; and I illustrated this in various ways. I said that 
the intellect must have an excellence of its own, for there was 
nothing which had not its specific good; that the word “edu- 
cate” would not be used of intellectual culture, as it is used, had 
not the intellect had an end of its own; that, had it not such an 
end, there would be no meaning in calling certain intellectual 
exercises “liberal,” in contrast with “useful,” as is commonly 
done; that the very notion of a philosophical temper implied 
it, for it threw us back upon research and system as ends in 
themselves, distinct from effects and works of any kind; that 
a philosophical scheme of knowledge, or system of sciences, 
could not, from the nature of the case, issue in any one definite 
art or pursuit, as its end; and that, on the other hand, the dis- 
covery and contemplation of truth, to which research and 
systematizing led, were surely sufficient ends, though nothing 
beyond them were added, and that they had ever been ac- 
counted sufficient by mankind. 
Here then I take up the subject; and, having determined 
that the cultivation of the intellect is an end distinct and suffi-
-P-A-G-E-34
  12 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
cient in itself, and that, so far as words go, it is an enlargement 
or illumination, I proceed to inquire what this mental breadth, 
or power, or light, or philosophy consists in. A Hospital heals 
a broken limb or cures a fever: what does an Institution effect, 
which professes the health, not of the body, not of the soul, 
but of the intellect? What is this good, which in former times, 
as well as our own, has been found worth the notice, the appro- 
priation, of the Catholic Church? 
I have then to investigate, in the Discourses which follow, 
those qualities and characteristics of the intellect in which its 
cultivation issues or rather consists; and, with a view of assisting 
myself in this undertaking, I shall recur to certain questions 
which have already been touched upon. These questions 
are three: viz., the relation of intellectual culture, first, to mere 
knowledge; secondly, to professional knowledge; and thirdly, to 
religious knowledge. In other words, are acquirements and 
attainments the scope of a University Education? or expertness 
im particular arts and pursuits? or moral and religious proficiency? 
or something besides these three? These questions I shall ex- 
amine in succession, with the purpose I have mentioned; and 
I hope to be excused, if, in this anxious undertaking, I am led 
to repeat what, either in these Discourses or elsewhere, I have 
already put upon paper. And first, of Mere Knowledge, or 
Learning, and its connection with intellectual illumination or 
Philosophy. 
It 
I suppose the prima-facie view which the public at large 
would take of a University, considering it as a place of Educa- 
tion, is nothing more or less than a place for acquiring a great 
deal of knowledge on a great many subjects. Memory is one 
of the first developed of the mental facilities; a boy’s business 
when he goes to school is to learn, that is, to store up things 
in his memory. For many years his intellect is little more

than an instrument for taking in facts, or a receptacle for 
storing them; he welcomes them as fast as they come to him; 
he lives on what is without; he has his eyes ever about him; 
he has a lively susceptibility of impressions; he imbibes in- 
formation of every kind; and little does he make his own in a 
true sense of the word, living rather upon his neighbors all 
around him. He has opinions, religious, political, and literary, 
and, for a boy, is very positive in them and sure about them; 
but he gets them from his school-fellows, or his masters, or his 
parents, as the case may be. Such as he is in his other relations, 
such also is he in his school exercises; his mind is observant, 
sharp, ready, retentive; he is almost passive in the acquisition 
of knowledge. I say this in no disparagement of the idea of a 
clever boy. Geography, chronology, history, language, natural 
history, he heaps up the matter of these studies as treasures 
for a future day. It is the seven years of plenty with him: 
he gathers in by handfuls, like the Egyptians, without count- 
ing; and though, as time goes on, there is exercise for his 
argumentative powers in the Elements of Mathematics, and 
for his taste in the Poets and Orators, still, while at school, or 
at least, till quite the last years of his time, he acquires, and 
little more; and when he is leaving for the University he is 
mainly the creature of foreign influences and circumstances, 
and made up of accidents, homogeneous or not, as the case may 
be. Moreover, the moral habits, which are a boy’s praise, en- 
courage and assist this result; that is, diligence, assiduity, 
regularity, dispatch, persevering application; for these are the 
direct conditions of acquisition, and naturally lead to it. 
Acquirements, again, are emphatically producible, and at a 
moment; they are a something to show, both for master and 
scholar; an audience, even though ignorant themselves of the 
subjects of an examination, can comprehend when questions 
are answered and when they are not. Here again is a reason 
why mental culture is in the minds of men identified with the 
acquisition of knowledge. 
The same notion possesses the public mind, when it passes 
on from the thought of a school to that of a University: and
-P-A-G-E-36
    
14 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
with the best of reasons so far as this, that there is no true 
culture without acquirements, and that philosophy presup- 
poses knowledge. It requires a great deal of reading, or a wide 
range of information, to warrant us in putting forth our opin- 
ions on any serious subject; and without such learning the most 
original mind may be able indeed to dazzle, to amuse, to refute, 
to perplex, but not to come to any useful result or any trust- 
worthy conclusion. There are indeed persons who profess a 
different view of the matter, and even act upon it. Every now 
and then you will find a person of vigorous or fertile mind, who 
relies upon his own resources, despises all former authors, and 
gives the world, with the utmost fearlessness, his views upon 
religion, or history, or any other popular subject. And his 
works may sell for a while; he may get a name in his day; but 
this will be all. His readers are sure to find on the long run 
that his doctrines are mere theories, and not the expression of 
facts, that they are chaff instead of bread, and then his popu- 
larity drops as suddenly as it rose. 
Knowledge then is the indispensable condition of expansion 
of mind, and the instrument of attaining to it; this cannot be 
denied; it is ever to be insisted on; I begin with it as a first 
principle; however, the very truth of it carries men too far, 
and confirms to them the notion that it is the whole of the 
matter. A narrow mind is thought to be that which contains 
little knowledge; and an enlarged mind, that which holds a 
great deal; and what seems to put the matter beyond dispute 
is the fact of the great number of studies which are pursued 
in a University by its very profession. Lectures are given on 
every kind of subject; examinations are held; prizes awarded. 
There are moral, metaphysical, physical Professors; Professors 
of languages, of history, of mathematics, of experimental science. 
Lists of questions are published, wonderful for their range and 
depth, variety and difficulty; treatises are written, which carry 
upon their very face the evidence of extensive reading or multi- 
farious information; what then is wanting for mental culture 
to a person of large reading and scientific attainments? what 
is grasp of mind but acquirement? where shall philosophical  
-P-A-G-E-37
  | PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 1g 
repose be found, but in the consciousness and enjoyment of 
large intellectual possessions? 
And yet this notion is, I conceive, a mistake, and my present 
business is to show that it is one, and that the end of a Liberal 
Education is not mere knowledge, or knowledge considered in 
its matter; and I shall best attain my object, by actually set- 
ting down some cases, which will be generally granted to be 
instances of the process of enlightenment or enlargement of 
mind, and others which are not, and thus, by the comparison, 
you will be able to judge for yourselves, Gentlemen, whether 
Knowledge, that is, acquirement, is after all the real principle 
of the enlargement, or whether that principle is not rather 
something beyond it. 
| Iv 
For instance, let a person, whose experience has hitherto 
been confined to the more calm and unpretending scenery of 
these islands, whether here or in England, go for the first time 
into parts where physical nature puts on her wilder and more 
awful forms, whether at home or abroad, as into mountainous 
districts; or let one, who has ever lived in a quiet village, go 
for the first time to a great metropolis,—then I suppose he 
will have a sensation which perhaps he never had before. He 
has a feeling not in addition or increase of former feelings, but 
of something different in its nature. He will perhaps be borne 
forward, and find for a time that he has lost his bearings. He 
has made a certain progress, and he has a consciousness of 
mental enlargement; he does not stand where he did, he has a 
new center, and a range of thoughts to which he was before a 
stranger. 
Again, the view of the heavens which the telescope opens 
upon us, if allowed to fill and possess the mind, may almost whirl 
it round and make it dizzy. It brings in a flood of ideas, and 
is rightly called an intellectual enlargement, whatever is meant 
by the term. 
And so again, the sight of beasts of prey and other foreign 
animals, their strangeness, the originality (if I may use the
-P-A-G-E-38
  
  16 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
term) of their forms and gestures and habits and their variety 
and independence of each other, throw us out of ourselves into 
another creation, and as if under another Creator, if I may so 
express the temptation which may come on the mind. We 
seem to have new faculties, or a new exercise for our faculties, 
by this addition to our knowledge; like a prisoner, who, having 
been accustomed to wear manacles or fetters, suddenly finds his 
arms and legs free. 
Hence Physical Science generally, in all its departments, as 
bringing before us the exuberant riches and resources, yet the 
orderly course, of the Universe, elevates and excites the student, 
and at first, I may say, almost takes away his breath, while in 
time it exercises a tranquilizing influence upon him. 
Again, the study of history is said to enlarge and enlighten 
the mind, and why? because, as I conceive, it gives it a power 
of judging of passing events, and of all events, and a conscious 
superiority over them, which before it did not possess. 
And in like manner, what is called seeing the world, entering 
into active life, going into society, traveling, gaining acquaint- 
ance with the various classes of the community, coming into 
contact with the principles and modes of thought of various 
parties, interests, and races, their views, aims, habits, and 
manners, their religious creeds and forms of worship,—gaining 
experience how various yet how alike men are, how low-minded, 
how bad, how opposed, yet how confident in their opinions; 
all this exerts a perceptible influence upon the mind, which it 
is impossible to mistake, be it good or be it bad, and is popu- 
larly called its enlargement. 
And then again, the first time the mind comes across the 
arguments and speculations of unbelievers, and feels what a novel 
light they cast upon what it has hitherto accounted sacred; and 
still more, if it gives in to them and embraces them, and throws 
off as so much prejudice what it has hitherto held, and, as if 
waking from a dream, begins to realize to its imagination that 
there is now no such thing as law and the transgression of law, 
that sin is a phantom, and punishment a bugbear, that it is 
free to sin, free to enjoy the world and the flesh; and still fur--
-P-A-G-E-39
  PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 17 
ther, when it does enjoy them, and reflects that it may think 
and hold just what it will, that “the world is all before it where 
to choose,” and what system to build up as its own private per- 
suasion; when this torrent of willful thoughts rushes over and 
inundates it, who-will deny that the fruit of the tree of knowl- 
edge, or what the mind takes for knowledge, has made it one 
of the gods, with a sense of expansion and elevation,—an in- 
toxication in reality, still, so far as the subjective state of the 
mind goes, an illumination? Hence the fanaticism of individuals 
or nations, who suddenly cast off their Maker. Their eyes are 
opened; and, like the judgment-stricken king in the Tragedy,! 
they see two suns, and a magic universe, out of which they 
look back upon their former state of faith and innocence with 
a sort of contempt and indignation, as if they were then but 
fools, and the dupes of imposture. : 
On the other hand, Religion has its own enlargement, and 
an enlargement, not of tumult, but of peace. It is often re- 
marked of uneducated persons, who have hitherto thought 
little of the unseen world, that, on their turning to God, looking 
into themselves, regulating their hearts, reforming their con- 
duct, and meditating on death and judgment, heaven and 
hell, they seem to become, in point of intellect, different beings 
from what they were. Before, they took things as they came, 
and thought no more of one thing than another. But now 
every event has a meaning; they have their own estimate of 
whatever happens to them; they are mindful of times and 
seasons, and compare the present with the past; and the world, 
no longer dull, monotonous, unprofitable, and hopeless, 1s a 
various and complicated drama, with parts and an object, and 
an awful moral. 
| Vv 
Now from these instances, to which many more might be 
added, it is plain, first, that the communication of knowledge 
certainly is either a condition or the means of that sense of en- 
\'The Bacche of Euripides. Pentheus, King of Thebes, having defied Dionysus, is smitten with madness. 
}
-P-A-G-E-40
  18 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
largement or enlightenment, of which at this day we hear so 
much in certain quarters: this cannot be denied; but next, 
it is equally plain, that such communication is not the whole 
of the process. The enlargement consists, not merely in the 
passive reception into the mind of a number of ideas hitherto 
unknown to it, but in the mind’s energetic and simultaneous 
action upon and towards and among those new ideas, which 
are rushing in upon it. It is the action of a formative power, 
reducing to order and meaning the matter of our acquirements; 
it is a making the objects of our knowledge subjectively our 
own, or, to use a familiar word, it is a digestion of what we re- 
ceive, into the substance of our previous state of thought; 
and without this no enlargement is said to follow. There 
is no enlargement, unless there be a comparison of ideas one 
with another, as they come before the mind, and a systematizing 
of them. We feel our minds to be growing and expanding 
then, when we not only learn, but refer what we learn to what 
we know already. It is not the mere addition to our knowl- 
edge that is the illumination; but the locomotion, the move- 
ment onwards, of that mental center, to which both what we 
know, and what we are learning, the accumulating mass of 
our acquirements, gravitates. And therefore a truly great 
intellect, and recognized to be such by the common opinion 
of mankind, such as the intellect of Aristotle, or of St. Thomas,! 
or of Newton, or of Goethe (I purposely take instances within 
and without the Catholic pale, when I would speak of the 
intellect as such), is one which takes a connected view of old 
and new, past and present, far and near, and which has an in- 
sight into the influence of all these one on another; without 
which there is no whole, and no center. It possesses the knowl- 
edge, not only of things, but also of their mutual and true 
relations; knowledge, not merely considered as acquirement, but 
as philosophy. 
Accordingly, when this analytical, distributive, harmonizing 
process is away, the mind experiences no enlargement, and is 
not reckoned as enlightened or comprehensive, whatever it 
1 Thomas Aquinas, the famous theologian of the thirteenth century. 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 19 
may add to its knowledge. For instance, a great memory, 
as I have already said, does not make a philosopher, any more 
than a dictionary can be called a grammar. There are men 
who embrace in their minds a vast multitude of ideas, but 
with little sensibility about their real relations towards each 
other. These may be antiquarians, annalists, naturalists; they 
may be learned in the law; they may be versed in statistics; 
they are most useful in their own place; I should shrink from 
speaking disrespectfully of them; still, there is nothing in such 
attainments to guarantee the absence of narrowness of mind. 
If they are nothing more than well-read men, or men 
of information, they have not what specially deserves the 
name of culture of mind, or fulfills the type of Liberal 
Education. 
In like manner, we sometimes fall in with persons who have 
seen much of the world, and of the men who, in their day, 
have played a conspicuous part in it, but who generalize noth- 
ing, and have no observation, in the true sense of the word. 
They abound in information in detail, curious and entertaining, 
about men and things; and, having lived under the influence of 
no very clear or settled principles, religious or political, they 
speak of everyone and everything, only as so many phe- 
nomena, which are complete in themselves, and lead to noth- 
ing, not discussing them, or teaching any truth, or instructing 
the hearer, but simply talking. No one would say that these 
persons, well informed as they are, had attained to any great 
culture of intellect or to philosophy. 
The case is the same still more strikingly where the per- 
sons in question are beyond dispute men of inferior powers 
and deficient education. Perhaps they have been much in 
foreign countries, and they receive, in a passive, otiose, un- 
fruitful way, the various facts which are forced upon them 
there. Seafaring men, for example, range from one end of the 
earth to the other; but the multiplicity of external objects 
which they have encountered forms no symmetrical and con- 
sistent picture upon their imagination; they see the tapestry 
of human life, as it were on the wrong side, and it tells no
-P-A-G-E-42
  20 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
story. They sleep, and they rise up, and they find themselves, 
now in Europe, now in Asia; they see visions of great cities 
and wild regions; they are in the marts of commerce, or amid 
the islands of the South; they gaze on Pompey’s Pillar,’ or 
on the Andes; and nothing which meets them carries them 
forward or backward, to any idea beyond itself. Nothing 
has a drift or relation; nothing has a history or a promise. 
Everything stands by itself, and comes and goes in its turn, 
like the shifting scenes of a show, which leave the spectator 
where he was. Perhaps you are near such a man on a particular 
occasion, and expect him to be shocked or perplexed at some- 
thing which occurs; but one thing is much the same to him 
as another, or, if he is perplexed, it is at not knowing what 
to say, whether it is right to admire, or to ridicule, or to dis- 
approve, while conscious that some expression of opinion is 
expected from him; for in fact he has no standard of judgment 
at all, and no landmarks to guide him to a conclusion. Such 
is mere acquisition, and, I repeat, no one would dream of 
calling it philosophy. 
VI 
Instances, such as these, confirm, by the contrast, the 
conclusion I have already drawn from those which preceded 
them. That only is true enlargement of mind which is the 
power of viewing many things at once as one whole, of referring 
them severally to their true place in the universal system, of 
understanding their respective values, and determining their 
mutual dependence. Thus is that form of Universal Knowl- 
edge, of which I have on a former occasion spoken, set up in 
the individual intellect, and constitutes its perfection. Pos- 
sessed of this real illumination, the mind never views any part 
of the extended subject-matter of Knowledge without recol- 
lecting that it is but a part, or without the associations which 
spring from this recollection. It makes everything in some 
sort lead to everything else; it would communicate the image 
1A shaft near Alexandria which has a traditional association with Pompey. 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 21 
of the whole to every separate portion, till that whole becomes 
in imagination like a spirit, everywhere pervading and pene- 
trating its component parts, and giving them one definite 
meaning. Just as our bodily organs, when mentioned, recall 
their function in the body, as the word “creation” suggests 
the Creator, and “subjects” a sovereign, so, in the mind of the 
Philosopher, as we are abstractedly conceiving of him, the 
elements of the physical and moral world, sciences, arts, pur- 
suits, ranks, offices, events, opinions, individualities, are all 
viewed as one, with correlative functions, and as gradually by 
successive combinations converging, one and all, to the true 
center. 
To have even a portion of this illuminative reason and true 
philosophy is the highest state to which nature can aspire, 
in the way of intellect; it puts the mind above the influences 
of chance and necessity, above anxiety, suspense, unsettlement, 
and superstition, which is the lot of the many. Men whose 
minds are possessed with some one object, take exaggerated 
views of its importance, are feverish in the pursuit of it, make 
it the measure of things which are utterly foreign to it, and 
are startled and despond if it happens to fail them. They are 
ever in alarm or in transport. Those on the other hand who 
have no object or principle whatever to hold by, lose their 
way every step they take. They are thrown out, and do not 
know what to think or say, at every fresh juncture; they have 
no view of persons, or occurrences, or facts, which come sud- 
denly upon them, and they hang upon the opinion of others, 
for want of internal resources. But the intellect, which has 
been disciplined to the perfection of its powers, which knows, 
and thinks while it knows, which has learned to leaven the 
dense mass of facts and events with the elastic force of reason, 
such an intellect cannot be partial, cannot be exclusive, cannot 
be impetuous, cannot be at a loss, cannot but be patient, col- 
lected, and majestically calm, because it discerns the end in 
every beginning, the origin in every end, the law in every 
interruption, the limit in each delay; because it ever knows 
where it stands, and how its path lies from one point to an-
-P-A-G-E-44

other. It is the rerpaywvos! of the Peripatetic, and as the “nil 
admirari’’ * of the Stoic,— 
Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas, 
Atque metus omnes, et inexorabile fatum 
Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari.3 
There are men who, when in difficulties, originate at the mo- 
ment vast ideas of dazzling projects; who, under the influence 
of excitement, are able to cast a light, almost as if from inspira- 
tion, on a subject or course of action which comes before them; 
who have a sudden presence of mind equal to any emergency, 
rising with the occasion, and an undaunted magnanimous 
bearing, and an energy and keenness which is but made in- 
tense by opposition. This is genius, this is heroism; it is the 
exhibition of a natural gift, which no culture can teach, at 
which no Institution can aim; here, on the contrary, we are 
concerned, not with mere nature, but with training and teach- 
ing. That perfection of the Intellect, which is the result of 
Education, and its beau ideal, to be imparted to individuals 
in their respective measures, is the clear, calm, accurate vision 
and comprehension of all things, as far as the finite mind can 
embrace them, each in its place, and with its own character- 
istics upon it. It is almost prophetic from its knowledge of 
history; it is almost heart-searching from its knowledge of 
human nature; it has almost supernatural charity from its 
freedom from littleness and prejudice; it has almost the repose 
of faith, because nothing can startle it; it has almost the beauty 
and harmony of heavenly contemplation, so intimate is it 
with the eternal order of things and the music of the spheres.

not Learning or Acquirement, but rather is Thought or Reason 
exercised upon Knowledge, or what may be called Philosophy, 
I shall be in a position to explain the various mistakes which 
at the present day beset the subject of University Education. 
I say then, if we would improve the intellect, first of all, 
we must ascend; we cannot gain real knowledge on a level; we 
must generalize, we must reduce to method, we must have a 
grasp of principles, and group and shape our acquisitions by 
means of them. It matters not whether our field of operation 
be wide or limited; in every case, to command it is to mount 
above it. Who has not felt the irritation of mind and im- 
patience created by a deep, rich country, visited for the first 
time, with winding lanes, and high hedges, and green steeps, 
and tangled woods, and every thing smiling indeed, but in a 
maze? The same feeling.comes upon us in a strange city, 
when we have no map of its streets. Hence you hear of practised 
travelers, when they first come into a place, mounting some high 
hill or church tower, by way of reconnoitering its neighborhood. 
In like manner, you must be above your knowledge, not under it, 
or it will oppress you; and the more you have of it, the greater 
will be the load. The learning of a Salmasius or a Burman,! 
unless you are its master, will be your tyrant. ‘“Imperat aut 
servit;”? if you can wield it with a strong arm, it is a great 
weapon; otherwise, 
Vis consili expers 
Mole ruit sua.’ 
You will be overwhelmed, like Tarpeia, by the heavy wealth 
which you have exacted from tributary generations. 
Instances abound; there are authors who are as pointless 
as they are inexhaustible in their literary resources. They meas- 
ure knowledge by bulk, as it lies in the rude block, without 
symmetry, without design. How many commentators are 
there on the Classics, how many on Holy Scripture, from 
1 Salmasius (1588-1653), a Dutch scholar; Burman (1668-1741), a Dutch theologian.

whom we rise up, wondering at the learning which has passed 
before us, and wondering why it passed! How many writers 
are there of Ecclesiastical History, such as Mosheim or Du 
Pin, who, breaking up their subject into details, destroy its 
life, and defraud us of the whole by their anxiety about the 
parts! The Sermons, again, of the English Divines in the 
seventeenth century, how often are they mere repertoires of 
miscellaneous and officious learning! Of course Catholics also 
may read without thinking; and in their case, equally as with 
Protestants, it holds good, that such knowledge is unworthy 
of the name, knowledge which they have not thought through, 
and thought out. Such readers are only possessed by their 
knowledge, not possessed of it; nay, in matter of fact they 
are often even carried away by it, without any volition of 
their own. Recollect, the Memory can tyrannize, as well as 
the Imagination. Derangement, I believe, has been considered 
as a loss of control over the sequence of ideas. The mind, 
once set in motion, is henceforth deprived of the power of 
initiation, and becomes the victim of a train of associations, 
one thought suggesting another, in the way of cause and effect, 
as if by a mechanical process, or some physical necessity. No 
one, who has had experience of men of studious habits, but 
must recognize the existence of a parallel phenomenon in the 
case of those who have over-stimulated the Memory. In such 
persons Reason acts almost as feebly and as impotently as in 
the madman; once fairly started on any subject whatever, 
they have no power of self-control; they passively endure the 
succession of impulses which are evolved out of the original 
exciting cause; they are passed on from one idea to another 
and go steadily forward, plodding along one line of thought 
in spite of the amplest concessions of the hearer, or wandering 
from it in endless digression in spite of his remonstrances. 
Now, if, as is very certain, no one would envy the madman 
the glow and originality of his conceptions, why must we extol 
the cultivation of that intellect, which is the prey, not indeed of 
barren fancies but of barren facts, of random intrusions from 
without, though not of morbid imaginations from within?
-P-A-G-E-47
    PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 25 
And in thus speaking, I am not denying that a strong and ready 
memory is in itself a real treasure; I am not disparaging a 
well-stored mind, though it be nothing besides, provided it 
be sober, any more than I would despise a bookseller’s shop:— 
it is of great value to others, even when not so to the owner. 
Nor am I banishing—far from it—the possessors of deep and 
multifarious learning from my ideal University; they adorn it 
in the eyes of men; I do but say that they constitute no type 
of the results at which it aims; that it is no great gain to the 
intellect to have enlarged the memory at the expense of facul- 
ties which are indisputably higher. 
VI 
Nor indeed am I supposing that there is any great dan- 
ger, at least in this day, of over-education; the danger is 
on the other side. I will tell you, Gentlemen, what has been 
the practical error of the last twenty years,—not to load the 
memory of the student with a mass of undigested knowledge, 
but to force upon him so much that he has rejected all. It 
has been the error of distracting and enfeebling the mind by an 
unmeaning profusion of subjects; of implying that a smattering 
in a dozen branches of study is not shallowness, which it really 
is, but enlargement, which it is not; of considering an acquaint- 
ance with the learned names of things and persons, and the 
possession of clever duodecimos, and attendance on eloquent lec- 
turers, and membership with scientific institutions, and the 
sight of the experiments of a platform and the specimens of a 
museum, that all this was not dissipation of mind, but progress. 
All things now are to be learned at once, not first one thing, 
then another, not one well, but many badly. Learning is to 
be without exertion, without attention, without toil; without 
grounding, without advance, without finishing. There is to 
be nothing individual in it; and this, forsooth, is the wonder 
of the age. What the steam engine does with matter, the 
printing press is to do with mind; it is to act mechanically, 
and the population is to be passively, almost unconsciously

  26 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
enlightened, by the mere multiplication and dissemination of 
volumes. Whether it be the school boy, or the school girl, 
or the youth at college, or the mechanic in the town, or the 
politician in the senate, all have been the victims in one way 
or other of this most preposterous and pernicious of delusions. 
Wise men have lifted up their voices in vain; and at length, 
lest their own institutions should be outshone and should dis- 
appear in the folly of the hour, they have been obliged, as far 
as they could with a good conscience, to humor a spirit which 
they could not withstand, and make temporizing concessions 
at which they could not but inwardly smile. 
It must not be supposed that, because I so speak, therefore 
I have some sort of fear of the education of the people: on the 
contrary, the more education they have, the better, so that it 
is really education. Nor am I an enemy to the cheap publica- 
tion of scientific and literary works, which is now in vogue: 
on the contrary, I consider it a great advantage, convenience, 
and gain; that is, to those to whom education has given a ca- 
pacity for using them. Further, I consider such innocent 
recreations as science and literature are able to furnish will 
be a very fit occupation of the thoughts and the leisure of 
young persons, and may be made the means of keeping them 
from bad employments and bad companions. Moreover, as 
to that superficial acquaintance with chemistry, and geology, 
and astronomy, and political economy, and modern history, 
and biography, and other branches of knowledge, which period- 
ical literature and occasional lectures and scientific institutions 
diffuse through the community, I think it a graceful accomplish- 
ment, and a suitable, nay, in this day a necessary accomplish- 
ment, in the case of educated men. Nor, lastly, am I dis- 
paraging or discouraging the. thorough acquisition of any one 
of these studies, or denying that, as far as it goes, such thorough 
acquisition is a real education of the mind. All I say is, call 
things by their right names, and do not confuse together ideas 
which are essentially different. A thorough knowledge of one 
science and a superficial acquaintance with many are not the 
same thing; a smattering of a hundred things or a memory ~

for detail is not a philosophical or comprehensive view. Recrea- 
tions are not education; accomplishments are not education. 
Do not say, the people must be educated, when, after all, you 
only mean, amused, refreshed, soothed, put into good spirits 
and good humor, or kept from vicious excesses. I do not say 
that such amusements, such occupations of mind, are not a 
great gain; but they are not education. You may as well call 
drawing and fencing education, as a general knowledge of 
botany or conchology. Stuffing birds or playing string instru- 
ments is an elegant pastime, and a resource to the idle, but 
it is not education; it does not form or cultivate the intellect. 
Education is a high word; it is the preparation for knowledge, 
and it is the imparting of knowledge in proportion to that 
preparation. We require intellectual eyes to know withal, as 
bodily eyes for sight. We need both objects and organs intel- 
lectual; we cannot gain them without setting about it; we 
cannot gain them in our sleep, or by haphazard. The best 
telescope does not dispense with eyes; the printing press or the 
lecture room will assist us greatly, but we must be true to 
ourselves, we must be parties in the work. A University is, 
according to the usual designation, an Alma Mater, knowing 
her children one by one, not a foundry, or a mint, or a treadmill. 
Ix 
I protest to you, Gentlemen, that if I had to choose be- 
tween a so-called University, which dispensed with residence 
and tutorial superintendence, and gave its degrees to any 
person who passed an examination in a wide range of subjects, 
and a University which had no professors or examinations at 
afl, but merely brought a number of young men together for 
three or four years, and then sent them away as the University 
of Oxford is said to have done some sixty years since, if I were 
asked which of these two methods was the better discipline of the 
intellect,—mind, I do not say which is morally the better, for 
it is plain that compulsory study must be a good and idleness 
an intolerable mischief,—but if I must determine which of the
-P-A-G-E-50

two courses was the more successful in training, molding, 
enlarging the mind, which sent out men the more fitted for their 
secular duties, which produced better public men, men of the 
world, men whose names would descend to posterity, I have 
no hesitation in giving the preference to that University which 
did nothing, over that which exacted of its members an ac- 
quaintance with every science under the sun. And, paradox 
as this may seem, still if results be the test of systems, the in- 
fluence of the public schools and colleges of England, in the 
course of the last century, at least will bear out one side of the 
contrast as I have drawn it. What would come, on the other 
hand, of the ideal systems of education which have fascinated 
the imagination of this age, could they ever take effect, and 
whether they would not produce a generation frivolous, narrow- 
minded and resourceless, intellectually considered, is a fair 
subject for debate; but so far is certain, that the Universities 
and scholastic establishments to which I refer, and which 
did little more than bring together first boys and then youths 
in large numbers, these institutions, with miserable deformities 
on the side of morals, with a hollow profession of Christianity, 
and a heathen code of ethics,—I say, at least they can boast 
of a succession of heroes and statesmen, of literary men and 
philosophers, of men conspicuous for great natural virtues, 
for habits of business, for knowledge of life, for practical judg- 
ment, for cultivated tastes, for accomplishments, who have 
made England what it is,—able to subdue the earth, able to 
domineer over Catholics. 
How is this to be explained? I suppose as follows: When 
a multitude of young men, keen, open-hearted, sympathetic, 
and observant, as young men are, come together and freely 
mix with each other, they are sure to learn one from another, 
even if there be no one to teach them; the conversation of all 
is a series of lectures to each, and they gain for themselves new 
ideas and views, fresh matter of thought, and distinct prin- 
ciples for judging and acting, day by day. An infant has to 
learn the meaning of the information which its senses convey 
to it, and this seems to be its employment. It fancies all that
-P-A-G-E-51
PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 29 
the eye presents to it to be close to it, till it actually learns the 
contrary, and thus by practice does it ascertain the relations 
and uses of those first elements of knowledge which are neces- 
sary for its animal existence. A parallel teaching is necessary 
for our social being, and is secured by a large school or a col- 
lege; and this effect may be fairly called in its own department 
an enlargement of mind. It is seeing the world on a small 
field with little trouble; for the pupils or students come from 
very different places, and with widely different notions, and 
there is much to generalize, much to adjust, much to eliminate, 
there are inter-relations to be defined, and conventional rules 
to be established, in the process, by which the whole assemblage 
is molded together, and gains one tone and one character. 
Let it be clearly understood, I repeat it, that I am not taking 
into account moral or religious considerations; I am but saying 
that.that youthful community will constitute a whole, it will 
embody a specific idea, it will represent a doctrine, it will 
administer a code of conduct, and it will furnish principles of 
thought and’ action. It will give birth to a living teaching, 
which in course of time will take the shape of a self-perpetuating 
tradition, or a genius loci,| as it is sometimes called; which 
haunts the home where it has been born, and which imbues and 
forms, more or less, and one by one, every individual who is 
successively brought under its shadow. Thus it is that, inde- 
pendent of direct instruction on the part of Superiors, there 
is a sort of self-education in the academic institutions of Prot- 
estant England; a characteristic tone of thought, a recognized 
standard of judgment is found in them, which, as developed 
in the individual who is submitted to it, becomes a twofold 
source of strength to him, both from the distinct stamp it im- 
presses on his mind, and from the bond of union which it 
creates between him and others,—effects which are shared 
by the authorities of the place, for they themselves have been 
educated in it, and at all times are exposed to the influence 
of its ethical atmosphere. Here then is a real teaching, what- 
ever be its standards and principles, true’or false; and it at

  30 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
least tends towards cultivation of the intellect, it at least 
recognizes that knowledge is something more than a sort of 
passive reception of scraps and details; it is a something, and it 
does a something, which never will issue from the most stren- 
uous efforts of a set of teachers, with no mutual sympathies 
and no inter-communion, of a set of examiners with no opinions 
which they dare profess, and with no common principles, who 
are teaching or questioning a set of youths who do not know 
them, and do not know each other, on a large number of sub- 
jects, different in kind, and connected by no wide philosophy, 
three times a week, or three times a year, or once in three years, 
in chill lecture-rooms or on a pompous anniversary. 
x 
Nay, self-education in any shape, in the most restricted 
sense, is preferable to a system of teaching which, professing 
so much, really does so little for the mind. aus your College 
gates against the votary of knowledge, throw! him back upon 
the searchings and the efforts of his own mind; he will gain 
by being spared an entrance into your Babel. Few indeed there 
are who can dispense with the stimulus and support of in- 
structors, or will do any thing at all, if left to themselves. 
And fewer still (though such great minds are to be found) 
who will not, from such unassisted attempts, contract a self- 
reliance and a self-esteem, which are not only moral evils, but 
serious hindrances to the attainment of truth. And next to 
none, perhaps, or none, who will not be reminded from time 
to time of the disadvantage under which they lie, by their 
imperfect grounding, by the breaks, deficiencies, and irregulari- 
ties of their knowledge, by the eccentricity of opinion and the 
confusion of principle which they exhibit. They will be too 
often ignorant of what every one knows and takes for granted, 
of that multitude of small truths which fall upon the mind 
like dust, impalpable and ever accumulating; they may be un- 
able to converse, they may argue perversely, they may pride 
themselves on their worst paradoxes or their grossest truisms,
-P-A-G-E-53
  
PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 31 
they may be full of their own mode of viewing things, un- 
willing to be put out of their way, slow to enter into the minds 
of others;—but, with these and whatever other liabilities upon 
their heads, they are likely to have more thought, more mind, 
more philosophy, more true enlargement, than those earnest 
but ill-used persons, who are forced to load their minds with 
a score of subjects against an examination, who have too much 
on their hands to indulge themselves in thinking or investiga- 
tion, who devour premise and conclusion together with in- 
discriminate greediness, who hold whole sciences on faith, and 
commit demonstrations to memory, and who too often, as 
might be expected, when their period of education is passed, 
throw up all they have learned in disgust, having gained noth- 
ing really by their anxious labors, except perhaps the habit of 
application. 
Yet such is the better specimen of the fruit of that am- 
bitious system which has of late years been making way among 
us: for its resulg on ordinary minds, and on the common run 
of students, is less satisfactory still; they leave their place of 
education simply dissipated and relaxed by the multiplicity 
of subjects, which they have never really mastered, and so 
shallow as not even to know their shallowness. How much 
better, I say, is it for the active and thoughtful intellect, where 
such is to be found, to eschew the College and the University 
altogether, than to submit to a drudgery so ignoble, a mockery 
so contumelious! How much more profitable for the independent 
mind, after the mere rudiments of education, to range through 
a library at random, taking down books as they meet him, 
and. pursuing the trains of thought which his mother wit sug- 
gests! How much healthier to wander into the fields, and 
there with the exiled Prince! to find “tongues in the trees, 
books in the running brooks!” How much more genuine 
an education is that of the poor boy in the Poem?—a Poem, 
whether in conception or in execution, one of the most touch- 
ing in our language—who, not in the wide world, but ranging

THE AIM OF THE LIBERAL COLLEGE? 
ALEXANDER MEIKLEJOHN 
[Alexander Meiklejohn (1872 ) was for several years professor of phi- 
losophy in Brown University. In 1912, he became president of Amherst 
College. The selection here printed was his inaugural address delivered 
upon the occasion of his induction into that office. It has become generally 
recognized as one of the classic statements of the claims of liberal learning.]   
In the discusgions concerning college education there is one 
voice which is all too seldom raised and all too often disre-

  PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 33 
garded. It is the voice of the teacher and the scholar, of the 
member of the college faculty. It is my purpose to devote this 
address to a consideration of the ideals of the teacher, of the 
problems of instruction as they present themselves to the men 
who are giving the instruction. And I do this not because I 
believe that just now the teachers are wiser than others who 
are dealing with the same questions, but rather as an expression 
of a definite conviction with regard to the place of the teacher 
in our educational scheme. It is, I believe, the function of the 
teacher to stand before his pupils and before the community 
at large as the intellectual leader of his time. If he is not 
able to take this leadership, he is not worthy of his calling. 
If the leadership is taken from him and given to others, then 
the very foundations of the scheme of instruction are shaken. 
He who in matters of teaching must be led by others is not 
the one to lead the imitative undergraduate, not the one to 
inspire the confidence and loyalty and discipleship on which 
all true teaching depends. If there are others who can do 
these things better than the college teacher of to-day, then 
we must bring them within the college walls. But if the teacher 
is to be deemed worthy of his task, then he must be recognized 
as the teacher of us all, and we must listen to his words as he 
speaks of the matters entrusted to his charge. 
In the consideration of the educational creed of the teacher 
I will try to give, first, a brief statement of his belief; second, 
a defense of it against other views of the function of the col- 
lege; third, an interpretation of its meaning and significance; 
fourth, a criticism of what seem to me misunderstandings of 
their own meaning prevalent among the teachers of our day; 
and, finally, a suggestion of certain changes in policy which 
must follow if the belief of the teacher is clearly understood 
and applied in our educational procedure. 
1 re 
First, then, What do our teachers believe to be the aim 
of college instruction? Wherever their opinions and convictions 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
    34 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
find expression, there is one contention which is always in the 
foreground, namely, that to be liberal, a college must be essen- 
tially intellectual. It is a place, the teachers tell us, in which 
a boy, forgetting all things else, may set forth on the enter- 
prise of learning. It is a time when a young man may come 
to awareness of the thinking of his people, may perceive what 
knowledge is and has been and is to be. Whatever light- 
hearted undergraduates may say, whatever the opinions of 
solicitous parents, of ambitious friends, of employers in search 
of workmen, of leaders in church or state or business,—what- 
ever may be the beliefind desires and demands of outsiders,— 
the teacher within the college, knowing his mission as no one 
else can know it, proclaims that mission to be the leading of his 
pupil into the life intellectual. The college is primarily not a 
place of the body, nor of the feelings, nor even of the will; 
it is, first of all, a place of the mind. 
I 
Against this intellectual interpretation of the college our 
teachers find two sets of hostile forces constantly at work. 
Outside the walls there are the practical demands of a busy 
commercial and social scheme; within the college there are the 
trivial and sentimental and irrational misunderstandings of 
‘its own friends. Upon each of these our college teachers are 
wont to descend as Samson upon the Philistines, and when 
they have had their will, there is little left for another to ac- 
complish. 
As against the immediate practical demands from without, 
the issue is clear and decisive. College teachers know that 
the world must have trained workmen, skilled operatives, 
clever buyers and sellers, efficient directors, resourceful manu- 
facturers, able lawyers, ministers, physicians, and teachers. 
But it is equally true that in order to do its own work, the 
liberal college must leave the special and technical training 
for these trades and professions to be done in other schools 
and by other methods. In a word, the liberal college does not
-P-A-G-E-57
  PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 35 
pretend to give all the kinds of teaching which a young man 
of college age may profitably receive; it does not even claim 
to give all the kinds of intellectual training which are worth 
giving. It is committed to intellectual training of the liberal 
type, whatever that may mean, and to that mission it must 
be faithful. One may safely say, then, on behalf of our college 
teachers, that their instruction is intended to be radically 
different from that given in the technical school or even in the 
professional school. Both these institutions are practical in a 
sense which the college, as an intellectual institution, is not. 
In the technical school the pupil is tataht how to do some of 
the mechanical operations which contribute to human welfare. 
He is trained to print, to weave, to farm, to build; and for the 
most part he is trained to do these things by practice rather 
than by theory. His possession when he leaves the school is 
not a stock of ideas, of scientific principles, but a measure of 
skill, a collection of rules of thumb. His primary function as 
a tradesman is not to understand but to do, and in doing what 
is needed he is following directions which have first been thought 
out by others and are now practised by him. The technical 
school intends to furnish training which, in the sense in which 
we use the term, is not intellectual but practical. 
In a corresponding way the work of the professional school 
differs from that of the liberal college. In the teaching of 
engineering, medicine, or law we are or may be beyond the 
realm of mere skill and within the realm of ideas and prin- 
ciples. But the selection and the relating of these ideas is 
dominated by an immediate practical interest which cuts them 
off from the intellectual point of view of the scholar. If an 
undergraduate should take away from his studies of chemistry, 
biology and psychology only those parts which have immediate 
practical application in the field of medicine, the college teach- 
ers would feel that they had failed to give to the boy the kind 
of instruction demanded of a college. It is not their purpose 
to furnish applied knowledge in this sense. They are not 
willing to cut up their sciences into segments and to allow 
the student to select these segments which may be of service 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  
  36 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
in the practice of an art or a profession. In one way or another 
the teacher feels a kinship with the scientist and the scholar 
which forbids him to submit to this domination of his instruc- 
tion by the demands of an immediate practical interest. What- 
ever it may mean, he intends to hold the intellectual point of 
view and to keep his students with him if he can. In response, 
then, to demands for technical and professional training our 
college teachers tell us that such training may be obtained 
in other schools; it is not to be had in a college of liberal culture. 
In the conflict with the forces within the college our teachers 
find themselves fighting essentially the same battle as against 
the foes without. In a hundred different ways the friends of 
the college, students, graduates, trustees, and even colleagues, 
seem to them so to misunderstand its mission as to mini- 
mize or to falsify its intellectual ideals. The college is a good 
place for making friends; it gives excellent experience in get- 
ting on with men; it has exceptional advantages as an 
athletic club; it is a relatively safe place for a boy when 
he first leaves home; on the whole it may improve a stu- 
dent’s manners; it gives acquaintance with lofty ideals of 
character, preaches the doctrine of social service, exalts 
the virtues and duties of citizenship. All these conceptions 
seem to the teacher to hide or to obscure the fact that the 
college is fundamentally a place of the mind, a time for thinking, 
an opportunity for knowing. And perhaps in proportion to 
their own loftiness of purpose and motive they are the more 
dangerous as tending all the more powerfully to replace or to 
nullify the underlying principle upon which they all depend. 
Here again when misconception clears away, one can have no 
doubt that the battle of the teacher is a righteous one. It is 
well that a boy should have four good years of athletic sport, 
playing his own game and watching the games of his fellows; 
it is well that his manners should be improved; it is worth while 
to make good friends; it is very desirable to develop the power 
of understanding and working with other men; it is surely good 
to grow in strength and purity of character, in devotion to the 
interests of society, in readiness to meet the obligations and
-P-A-G-E-59
  PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 37 
opportunities of citizenship. If any one of these be lacking 
from the fruits of a college course we may well complain of the 
harvest. And yet is it not true that by sheer pressure of these, 
by the driving and pulling of the social forces within and without 
the college, the mind of the student is constantly torn from its 
chief concern? Do not our social and practical interests dis- 
tract our boys from the intellectual achievements which should 
dominate their imagination and command their zeal? I believe 
that one may take it as the deliberate judgment of the teachers 
of our colleges to-day that the function of the college is con- 
stantly misunderstood, and that it is subjected to demands 
which, however friendly in intent, are yet destructive of its 
intellectual efficiency and success. 
Il 
But now that the contention of the teacher has been stated 
and reaffirmed against objections, it is time to ask, What 
does it mean? And how can it be justified? By what right 
does a company of scholars invite young men to spend with 
them four years of discipleship? Do they, in their insistence 
upon the intellectual quality of their ideal, intend to give an 
education which is avowedly unpractical? If so, how shall they 
justify their invitation, which may perhaps divert young men 
from other interests and other companionships which are valu- 
able to themselves and to their fellows? In a word, what is the 
underlying motive of the teacher, what is there in the intellectual 
interests and activities which seems to him to warrant their 
domination over the training and instruction of young men dur- 
ing the college years? 
It is no fair answer to this question to summon us to faith 
in intellectual ideals, to demand of us that we live the life of the 
mind with confidence in the virtues of intelligence, that we love 
knowledge and because of our passion follow after it. Most 
of us are already eager to accept intellectual ideals, but our 
very devotion to them forbids that we accept them blindly. I 
have often been struck by the inner contradictoriness of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  38 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
demand that we have faith in intelligence. It seems to mean, 
as it is so commonly made to mean, that we must unintelligently 
follow intelligence, that we must ignorantly pursue knowledge, 
that we must question everything except the business of asking 
questions, that we think about everything except the use of 
thinking itself. As Mr. F. H. Bradley would say, the dictum, 
“Have faith in intelligence,” is so true that it constantly threat- 
ens to become false. Our very conviction of its truth compels 
us to scrutinizé and test it to the end. 
How then shall we justify the faith of the teacher? What 
reason can we give for our exaltation of intellectual training and 
activity? To this question two answers are possible. First, 
knowledge and thinking are good in themselves. Secondly, 
they help us in the attainment of other values in life which 
without them would be impossible. Both these answers may 
be given and are given by college <eachers. Within them must 
be found whatever can be said by way of explanation and justi- 
fication of the work of the liberal college. 
The first answer receives just now far less of recognition than 
it can rightly claim. When the man of the world is told that a 
boy is to be trained in thinking just because of the joys and satis- 
factions of thinking itself, just in order that he may go on think- 
ing as long as he lives, the man of the world has been heard 
to scoff and to ridicule the idle dreaming of scholarly men. But 
if thinking is not a good thing in itself, if intellectual activity 
is not worth while for its own sake, will the man of the world 
tell us what is? There are those among us who find so much 
satisfaction in the countless trivial and vulgar amusements of a 
crude people that they have no time for the joys of the mind. 
There are those who are so closely shut up within a little round 
of petty pleasures that they have never dreamed of the fun of 
reading and conversing and investigating and reflecting. And 
of these one can only say that the difference is one of taste, and 
that their tastes seem to be relatively dull and stupid. Surely 
it is one function of the liberal college to save boys from that 
stupidity, to give them an appetite for the pleasures of thinking, 
to make them sensitive to the joys of appreciation and under-
-P-A-G-E-61
  
PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 39 
standing, to show them how sweet and captivating and whole- 
some are the games of the mind. At the time when the play 
element is still dominant it is worth while to acquaint boys with 
the sport of facing and solving problems. Apart from some of 
the experiences of friendship and sympathy I doubt if there are 
any human interests so permanently satisfying, so fine and 
splendid in themselves, as are those of intellectual activity. 
To give our boys that zest, that delight in things intellectual, 
to give them an appreciation of a kind of life which is well worth 
living, to make them men of intellectual culture—that certainly 
is one part of the work of any liberal college. 
On the other hand, the creation of culture as so defined can 
never constitute the full achievement of the college. It is 
essential to awaken the impulses of inquiry, of experiment, of 
investigation, of reflection, the instinctive cravings of the mind. 
But no liberal college can be content with this. The impulse 
to thinking must be questioned and rationalized as must every 
other instinctive response. It is well to think, but what shall 
we think about? Are there any lines of investigation and reflec- 
tion more valuable than others, and if so, how is their value to 
be tested? Or again, if the impulse for thinking comes into con- 
flict with other desires and cravings, how is the opposition to be 
solved? It has sometimes been suggested that our man of 
intellectual culture may be found like Nero fiddling with words 
while all the world about him is aflame. And the point of the 
suggestion is not that fiddling is a bad and worthless pastime, 
but rather that it is inopportune on such an occasion, that the 
man who does it is out of touch with his situation, that his fid- 
dling does not fit his facts. Ina word, men know with regard to 
thinking, as with regard to every other content of human ex- 
perience, that it cannot be valued merely in terms of itself. It 
must be measured in terms of its relation to other contents and 
to human experience as a whole. Thinking is good in itself,— 
but what does it cost of other things, what does it bring of other 
values? Place it amid all the varied contents of our individual 
and social experience, measure it in terms of what it implies, fix 
it by means of its relations, and then you will know its worth
-P-A-G-E-62
40 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
not, simply in itself but in that deeper sense which comes when 
human desires are rationalized and human lives are known in 
their entirety, as well as they can be known by those who are 
engaged in living them. 
In this consideration we find the second answer of the teacher 
to the demand for justification of the work of the college. 
Knowledge is good, he tells us, not only in itself, but in its» 
enrichment and enhancement of the other values of our @x- 
perience. In the deepest and fullest sense of the words, knowl- 
edge pays. This statement rests upon the classification of 
human actions into two groups, those of the instinctive type 
and those of the intellectual type. By far the greater part of 
our human acts are carried on without any clear idea of what 
we are going to do or how we are going to do it. For the most 
part our responses to our situations are the immediate re- 
sponses of feeling, of perception, of custom, of tradition. But 
slowly and painfully, as the mind has developed, action after 
action has been translated from the feeling to the ideational 
type; in wider and wider fields men have become aware of 
their own modes of action, more and more they have come to 
understanding, to knowledge of themselves and of their needs. 
And the principle underlying all our educational procedure 
is that, on the whole, actions become more successful as they 
pass from the sphere of feeling to that of understanding. Our 
educational belief is that in the long run if men know what 
they are going to do and how they are going to do it, and what 
is the nature of the situation with which they are dealing, their 
response to that situation will be better adjusted and more 
beneficial than are the responses of the feeling type in like 
situations. 
It is all too obvious that there are limits to the validity of 
this principle. If men are to investigate, to consider, to decide, 
then action must be delayed and we must pay the penalty of 
waiting. If men are to endeavor to understand and know their 
situations, then we must be prepared to see them make mis- 
takes in their thinking, lose their’certainty of touch, wander 
off into pitfalls and illusions and fallacies of thought, and in
-P-A-G-E-63
  PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 4r 
consequence secure for the time results far lower in value than 
those of the instinctive response which they seek to replace. 
The delays and mistakes and uncertainties of our thinking are 
a heavy price to pay, but it is the conviction of the teacher that 
the price is as nothing when compared with the goods which 
it buys. You may point out to him the loss when old methods 
of procedure give way before the criticism of understanding, 
yoti may remind him of the pain and suffering when old habits 
of thought and action are replaced, you may reprove him for 
all the blunders of the past; but in spite of it all he knows and 
you know that in human lives taken separately and in human 
life as a whole men’s greatest lack is the lack of understanding, 
their greatest hope to know themselves and the world in which 
they live. 
Within the limits of this general educational principle the 
place of the liberal college may easily be fixed. In the technical 
school pupils are prepared for a specific work and are kept for 
the most part on the plane of perpetual action, doing work 
which others understand. In the professional school, students 
are properly within the realm of ideas and principles, but they 
are still limited to a specific human interest with which alone 
their understanding is concerned. But the college is called 
liberal as against both of these because the instruction is dom- 
inated by no special interest, is limited to no single task, but 
is intended to take human activity as a whole, to understand 
human endeavors not in their isolation but in their relations 
to one another and to the total experience which we call the 
life of our people. And just as we believe that the building of 
ships has become more successful as men have come to a knowl- 
edge of the principles involved in their construction; just as 
the practice of medicine has become more successful as we have 
come to a knowledge of the human body, of the conditions 
within it and the influences without;—just so the teacher in 
the liberal college believes that life as a total enterprise, life as 
it presents itself to each one of us in his career as an individual, 
human living,—will be more successful in so far as men come 
“to understand it and to know it as they attempt to carry it

on. To give boys an intellectual grasp on human experience— 
this it seems to me is the teacher’s conception of the chief 
function of the liberal college. 
May I call attention to the fact that this second answer 
of the teacher defines the aim of the college as avowedly and 
frankly practical. Knowledge is to be sought chiefly for the 
sake of its contribution to the other activities of human living. 
But on the other hand, it is as definitely declared that in method 
the college is fully and unreservedly intellectual. If we can 
see that these two demands are not in conflict but that they 
stand together in the harmonious relation of means and ends 
of instrument and achievement, of method and result, we may 
escape many a needless conflict and keep our educational policy 
in singleness of aim andaction. To do this we must show that 
the college is intellectual, not as opposed to practical interests 
and purposes, but as opposed to unpractical and unwise methods 
of work. The issue is not between practical and intellectual 
aims but between the immediate and the remote aim, between 
the hasty and the measured procedure, between the demand 
for results at once and the willingness to wait for the best 
results. The intellectual road to success is longer and more 
roundabout than any other, but they who are strong .and 
willing for the climbing are brought to higher levels of achieve- 
ment than they could possibly have attained had they gone 
straight forward in the pathway of quick returns. If this were 
not true the liberal college would have no proper place in our 
life at all. In so far as it is true, the college has a right to claim 
the best of our young men to give them its preparation for the 
living they are to do. 
IV 
But now that we have attempted to interpret the intel- 
lectual mission of the college, it may be fair to ask, “Are the 
teachers and scholars of our day always faithful to that mis- 
sion? Do their statements and their practice always ring in 
accord with the principle which has been stated?” It seems 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 43 
to me that at two points they are constantly off the key, con- 
stantly at variance with the reasons by which alone their 
teaching can be justified. 
In the first place, it often appears as if our teachers and 
scholars were deliberately in league to mystify and befog the 
popular mind regarding this practical value of intellectual 
work. They seem not to wish too much said about the results 
and benefits. Their desire is to keep aloft the intellectual 
banner, to proclaim the intellectual gospel, to demand of stu- 
dent and public alike adherence to the faith. And in general 
when they are questioned as to results they give little satis- 
faction except to those who are already pledged to unwavering 
confidence in their ipse dixits. And largely as a result of this 
attitude the American people seem to me to have little under- 
standing of the intellectual work of the college. Our citizens 
and patrons can see the value of games and physical exercises; 
they readily perceive the importance of the social give and 
take of a college democracy; they can appreciate the value of 
studies which prepare a young man for his profession and so 
anticipate or replace the professional school; they can even 
believe that if a boy is kept at some sort of thinking for four 
years his mind may become more acute, more systematic, more 
accurate, and hence more useful than it was before. But as 
for the content of a college course, as for the value of knowledge, 
what a boy gains by knowing Greek or economics, philosophy 
or literature, history or biology, except as they are regarded 
as having professional usefulness, I think our friends are in 
the dark and are likely to remain so until we turn on the light. 
When our teachers say, as they sometimes do say, that the effect 
of knowledge upon the character and life of the student must al- 
ways be for the college an accident, a circumstance which has 
no essential connection with its real aim or function, then it 
seems to me that our educational policy is wholly out of joint. 
If there be no essential connection between instruction and life, 
then there is no reason for giving instruction except in so far 
as it is pleasant in itself, and we have no educational policy at 
all. As against this hesitancy, this absence of a conviction,  
-P-A-G-E-66
44 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
s 
we men of the college should declare in clear and unmistakable 
terms our creed—the creed that knowledge is justified by its 
results. _We should say to our people so plainly that they 
cannot misunderstand, “Give us your boys, give us the 
means we need, and we will so train and inform the minds of 
those boys that their own lives and the lives of the men about 
them shall be more successful than they could be without our 
training. Give us our chance and we will show your boys what 
human living is, for we are convinced that they can live better 
in knowledge than they can in ignorance.” 
There is a second wandering from the faith which is so com- 
mon among investigators that it may fairly be called the “fallacy 
of the scholar.” It is the belief that all knowledge is so good 
that all parts of knowledge are equally good. Ask many of our 
scholars and teachers what subjects a boy should study in order 
that he may gain insight for human living, and they will say, 
“Tt makes no difference in what department of knowledge he 
studies; let him go into, Sanscrit or bacteriology, into mathema- 
tics or history; if only he goes where men are actually dealing 
with intellectual problems, and -if only he learns how to deal 
with problems himself, the aim of education is achieved, he has 
entered into intellectual activity.” This point of view, running 
through all the varieties of the elective system, seems to me 
hopelessly at variance with any sound educational doctrine. It 
represents the scholar of the day at his worst both as a thinker 
and as a teacher. In so far as it dominates a group of college 
teachers it seems to me to render them unfit to determine and to 
administer a college curriculum. It is an announcement that 
they have no guiding principles in their educational practice, 
no principles of selection in their arrangement of studies, no 
genuine grasp on the relationship between knowledge and life. 
It is the concerted statement of a group of men each of whom is 
lost within the limits of his own special studies, and who as a 
group seem not to realize the organic relationships between 
them nor the common task which should bind them together. 
In bringing this second criticism against our scholars I am 
not urging that the principle of election of college studies should 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 45 
\ 
be entirely discontinued. But I should like to inquire by what 
right and within what limits it is justified. The most familiar 
argument in its favor is that if a student is allowed to choose 
along the lines of his own intellectual or professional interest 
he will have enthusiasm, the eagerness which comes with the 
following of one’s own bent. Now just so far as this result is 
achieved, just so far as the quality of scholarship is improved, 
the procedure is good and we may follow it if we do not thereby 
lose other results more valuable than our gain. But if the special 
interest comes into conflict with more fundamental ories, if 
what the student prefers is opposed to what he ought to prefer, 
then we of the college cannot leave the choice with him. We 
must say to him frankly, “If you do not care for liberal training 
you had better go elsewhere; we have a special and definite 
task assigned us which demands that we keep free from the 
domination of special or professional pursuits. So long as we 
are faithful to that task we cannot give you what you ask.” 
In my opinion, however, the fundamental motive of the elec- 
tive system is not the one which has been mentioned. In the 
last resort our teachers allow students to choose their own studies 
not in order to appeal to intellectual or to professional interest, 
but because they themselves have no choice of their own in 
which they believe with sufficient intensity to impose it upon 
their pupils. And this lack of a dominating educational policy 
is in turn an expression of an intellectual attitude, a point of 
view, which marks the scholars of our time. In a word, it seems 
to me that our willingness to allow students to wander about 
in the college curriculum is one of the most characteristic ex- 
pressions of a certain intellectual agnosticism, a kind of intellec- 
tual bankruptcy, into which, in spite of all our wealth of informa- 
tion, the spirit of the time has fallen. Let me — my mean- 
ing. 
The old classical curriculum was founded by men who had a 
theory of the world and of human life. They had taken all the 
available content of human knowledge and had wrought it to- 
gether into a coherent whole. What they knew was, as judged 
by our standards, very little in amount. But upon that little
-P-A-G-E-68
  46 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
content they had expended all the infinite pains of understanding 
and interpretation. They had taken the separate judgments of 
science, philosophy, history, and the arts, and had so welded 
them together, so established their relationships with one another, 
so freed them from contradictions and ambiguities that, so far 
as might be in their day and generation, human life as a whole 
and the world about us were known, were understood, were 
rationalized. They had a knowledge of human experience by 
which they could live and which they could teach to others 
engaged in the activities of living. 
But with the invention of methods of scientific investigation 
and discovery there came pouring into the mind of Europe great 
masses of intellectual material,—astronomy, physics, chemistry. 
This content for a time it could not understand, could not relate 
to what it already knew. The old boundary lines did not en- 
close the new fields, the old explanations and interpretations 
would not fit the new facts. Knowledge had not grown, it had 
simply been enlarged, and the two masses of content, the old 
and the new, stood facing each other with no common ground 
of understanding. Here was the intellectual task of the great 
leaders of the early modern thought of Europe: to re-establish 
the unity of knowledge, to discover the relationships between 
these apparently hostile bodies of judgments, to know the world 
again, but with all the added richness of the new insights and 
the new information. This was the work of Leibnitz and 
Spinoza, of Kant and Hegel, and those who labored with them. 
And in a very considerable measure the task had been accom- 
plished, order had been restored. But again with the inrush 
of the newer discoveries, first in the field of biology and then 
later in the world of human relationships, the difficulties have 
returned, multiplied a thousand fold. Every day sees a new 
field of facts opened up, a new method of investigation invented, 
a new department of knowledge established. And in the rush of 
it all these new sciences come merely as additions, not to be un- 
derstood but simply numbered, not to be interpreted but simply 
listed in the great collection of separate fields of knowledge. 
If you will examine the work of any scientist within one of these 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 47 
fields you will find him ordering, systematizing, reducing to 
principles, in a word, knowing every fact in terms of its relation 
to every other fact and to the whole field within which it falls. 
But at the same time these separate sciences, these separate 
groups of judgment, are left standing side by side with no intelli- 
gible connections, no establishment of relationships, no interpre- 
tation in the:sense in which we insist upon it with each of the fields 
taken by itself. Is it not the characteristic statement of a 
scholar of our time to say, “I do not know what may be the 
ultimate significance of these facts and these principles; all that 
I know is that if you will follow my methods within my field you 
will find the facts coming into order, the principles coming into 
simple and coherent arrangement. With any problems apart 
from this order and this arrangement I have intellectually no 
concern.” 
It has become an axiom with us that the genuine student 
labors within his own field. And if the student ventures forth 
to examine the relations of his field to the surrounding country 
he very easily becomes a popularizer, a litterateur, a speculator, 
and worst of all, unscientific. Now I do not object to a man’s 
minding his own intellectual business if he chooses to do so, 
but when a man minds his own business because he does not 
know any other business, because he has no knowledge whatever 
of the relationships which justify his business and make it worth 
while, then I think one may say that though such a man minds 
his own affairs he does not know them, he does not understand 
them. Such a man, from the point of view of the demands of a 
liberal education, differs in no essential respect from the trades- 
man who does not understand his trade or the professional man 
who merely practices his profession. Just as truly as they, he 
is shut up within a special interest; just as truly as they, he is 
making no intellectual attempt to understand his experience in 
its unity. And the pity of it is that more and more the chairs 
in our colleges are occupied by men who have only this special 
interest, this specialized information, and it is through them that 
we attempt to give our boys a liberal education, which the teach- 
ers themselves have not achieved. 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  48 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
I should not like to be misunderstood in making this railing 
accusation against our teachers and our time. If I say that 
our knowledge is at present a collection of scattered observations 
about the world rather than an understanding of it, fairness 
compels the admission that the failure is due to the inherent 
difficulties of the situation and to the novelty of the problems 
presented. If I cry out against the agnosticism of our people it 
is not as one who has escaped from it, nor as one who would 
point the way back to the older synthesis, but simply as one who 
believes that the time has come for a-reconstruction, for a new 
synthesis. We have had time enough now to get some notion 
of our bearings, shocks enough to get over our nervousness and 
discomfiture when a new one comes along. It is the opportunity 
and the obligation of this generation to think through the con- 
tent of our knowing once again, to understand it, so far as we 
can. And in such a battle as this, surely it is the part of the 
college to take the lead. Here is the mission of the college 
teacher as of no other member of our common life. Surely he 
should stand before his pupils and before all of us as a man who 
has achieved some understanding of this human situation of ours, 
but more than that, as one who is eager for the conflict with 
the powers of darkness and who can lead his pupils in enthusi- 
astic devotion to the common cause of enlightenment. 
¥ 
And now, finally, after these attacks upon the policies 
which other men have derived from their love of knowledge, 
may I suggest two matters of policy which seem to me to follow 
from the definition of education which we have taken. The 
first concerns the content of the college course; the second has 
to do with the method of its presentation to the undergraduate. 
We have said that the system of free election is natural for 
those to whom knowledge is simply a number of separate depart- 
ments. It is equally true that just in so far as knowledge attains 
unity, just so far as the relations of the various departments are 
perceived, freedom of election by the student must be limited.
-P-A-G-E-71
PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 49 
For it at once appears that on the one side there are vast ranges 
of information which have virtually no significance for the pur- 
poses of a liberal education, while on the other hand there are 
certain elements so fundamental and vital that without any one 
of them a liberal education is impossible. 
I should like to indicate certain parts of human knowledge 
which seem to me so essential that no principle of election 
should ever be allowed to drive them out of the course of any 
college student. 
First, a student should becqme acquainted with the funda- 
mental motives and purposes and beliefs which, clearly, or 
unclearly recognized, underlie all human experience and bind 
it together. He must perceive the moral strivings, the intellec- 
tual endeavors, the esthetic experiences of his race, and closely 
linked with these, determining and determined by them, the 
beliefs about the world which have appeared in our systems of 
religion. To investigate this field, to bring it to such clearness 
of formulation as may be possible, is the task of philosophy—an 
essential element in any liberal education. Secondly, as in 
human living, our motives, purposes, and beliefs have found ex- 
pression in institutions,—those concerted modes of procedure by 
which we work together,—a student should be made acquainted 
with these. He should see and appreciate what is intended, 
what accomplished, and what left undone by such institu- 
tions as property, the courts, the family, the church, the mill. 
To know these as contributing and failing to contribute to 
human welfare is the work of our social or humanistic sciences, 
into which a boy must go on his way through the liberal college. 
Thirdly, in order to understand the motives and the institutions 
of human life one must know the conditions which surround it, 
the stage on which the gameis played. To give this information 
is the business of astronomy, geology, physics, chemistry, biology 
and the other descriptive sciences. These a boy must know, so 
far as they are significant and relevant to his purpose. Fourthly, 
as all three of these factors, the motives, the institutions, the 
natural processes have sprung from the past and have come to 
be what they are by change upon change in the process of time, 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
    
so COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
the student of human life must try to learn the sequence of 
events from which the present has come. The development of 
human thought and attitude, the development of human insti- 
tutions, the development of the world and of the beings about 
us—all these must be known, as throwing light upon present 
problems, present instrumentalities, present opportunities in 
the life of human endeavor. And in addition to these four 
studies which render human experience in terms of abstract 
ideas, a liberal education must take account of those concrete 
representations of life which are given in the arts, and especially 
in the art of literature. It is well that a boy should be.acquaint- 
ed with his world not simply as expressed by the principles of 
knowledge but also as depicted by the artist with all the vivid- 
ness and definiteness which are possible in the portrayal of 
individual beings in individual relationships. These five ele- 
ments, then, a young man must take from a college of liberal 
training, the contributions of philosophy, of humanistic science, 
of natural science, of history, and of literature. So far as 
knowledge is concerned, these at least he should have, welded 
together in some kind of interpretation of his own experience 
and of the world in which he lives. 
My second suggestion is that our college curriculum should 
be so arranged and our instruction so devised that its vital con- 
nection with the living of men should be obvious even to an 
undergraduate. A little while ago I heard one of the most 
prominent citizens of this country speaking of his college days, 
and he said, “I remember so vividly those few occasions on 
which the professor would put aside the books and talk like a 
real man about real things.” Oh, the bitterness of those words 
to the teacher! Our books are not dealing with the real things, 
and for the most part we are not real men either, but just old 
fogies and bookworms. And to be perfectly frank about the 
whole matter, I believe that in large measure our pupils are 
indifferent to their studies simply because they do not see that 
these are important. 
Now if we really have a vital course of study to present I 
believe that this difficulty can in large measure be overcome.
-P-A-G-E-73
  PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE st 
It is possible to make a freshman realize the need of trans- 
lating his experience from the forms of feeling to those of ideas. 
He can and he ought to be shown that now, his days of mere 
tutelage being over, it is time for him to face the problems of 
his people, to begin to think about those problems for himself, 
to learn what other men have learned and thought before 
him; in a word, to get himself ready to take his place among 
those who are responsible for the guidance of our common life 
by ideas and principles and purposes. If this could be done, I 
think we should get from the reality-loving American boy 
something like an intellectual enthusiasm, something of the 
spirit that comes when he plays a game that seems to him 
really worth playing. But I do not believe that this result 
can be achieved without a radical reversal of the arrangement 
of the college curriculum. I should like to see every freshman 
at once plunged into the problems of philosophy, into the 
difficulties and perplexities about our institutions, into the 
scientific accounts of the world especially as they bear on 
human life, into the portrayals of human experience which are 
given by the masters of literature. If this were done by proper 
teaching, it seems to me the boy’s college course would at once 
take on significance for him; he would understand what he is 
about; and though he would be a sadly puzzled boy at the 
end of the first year, he would still have before him three good 
years of study, of investigation, of reflection, and of disciple- 
ship, in which to achieve, so far as may be, the task to which he 
has been set. Let him once feel the problems of the present, 
and his historical studies will become significant; let him know 
what other men have discovered and thought about his prob- 
lems, and he will be ready to deal with them himself. But in 
any case, the whole college course will be unified and dominated 
by a single interest, a single purpose,—that of so understanding 
human life as to be ready and equipped for the practice of it. 
And this would mean for the college, not another seeking of the 
way of quick returns, but rather an escape from aimless wander- 
ings in the mere by-paths of knowledge, a resolute climbing 
on the high road to a unified grasp upon human experience.

2) COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
I have taken so much of your time this morning that an 
apology seems due for the things I have omitted to mention. 
I have said nothing of the organization of the college, nothing 
of the social life of the students, nothing of the relations with 
the alumni, nothing of the needs and qualifications of the teach- 
ers, and even within the consideration of the course of study, 
nothing of the value of specialization or of the disciplinary 
subjects or of the training in language and expression. And 
T have put these aside deliberately, for the sake of a cause which 
is greater than any of them—a cause which lies at the very 
heart of the liberal college. It is the cause of making clear to 
the American people the mission of the teacher, of convincing 
them of the value of knowledge: not the specialized knowledge 
which contributes to immediate practical aims, but the unified 
understanding which is Insight.

THE NEW DEFINITION OF THE CULTIVATED MAN ! 
Cartes WILLIAM ELIOT 
  
[Charles William Eliot (1834: ) has been one of the foremost figures in 
American education for a great many years. During the larger part of his 
career as an educator, he was president of Harvard College, retiring in 
1909 as president emeritus.. He has written widely on educational topics, 
and has exerted a powerful influence in the shaping of the tendencies of 
American education of the present. This selection was delivered originally 
as a presidential address before the National Education Association.] 
To produce the cultivated man, or at least the man capable 
of becoming cultivated in after-life, has long been supposed 
to be one of the fundamental objects of systematic and thorough 
education. The ideal of general cultivation has been one of 
the standards in education. It is often asked: Will the edu- 
cation which a given institution is supplying produce the 
cultivated man? Or, Can cultivation be the result of a given 
cours} of study? In such questions there is an implication that 
\ the education which does not produce the cultivated man is a 
failure, or has been misconceived, or misdirected. Now, if 
cultivation were an unchanging ideal, the steady use of the 
_ conéeption as a permanent test of educational processes might 
We justified; but if the cultivated man of to-day is, or ought 
to-be, a distinctly different creature from the cultivated man 
of a century ago, the ideal of cultivation cannot be appealed 
. to as a standard without preliminary explanations and inter- 
pretation) 1 is the object of this paper to show that the idea 
*of(cyitivation in the highly trained human being has undergone 
“~gubstantial changes during the nineteenth century. °

tivated man” in only its good sense—in Emerson’s sense. In

vain of a little exclusive information or of an uncommon knack 
in Latin verse or mathematical logic¥he is to be a man of 
quick perceptions, broad sympathies, and wide affinities; re- 
sponsive, but independent; self-reliant, but deferential; loving 
truth and candorXbut also moderation and proportion; coura- 
geous, but gentle; not finished, but perfecting. All authorities 
agree that true culture is not exclusive, sectarian, or partisan, 
but the very opposite; that it is not to be attained in solitude, 
but in society; and that the best atmosphere for culture is 
that of a school, university, academy, or church, where many 
pursue together the ideals of truth, righteousness, and love. 
Here someone may think: This process of cultivation is evi- 
dently a long, slow, artificial process; I prefer the genius, the 
man of native power or skill, the man whose judgment is sound 
and influence strong, though he cannot read or write—the 
born inventor, orator, or poet. So do we all. Men have always 
reverenced prodigious inborn gifts, and always will. Indeed, bar- 
barous men always say of the possessors of such gifts: These 
are not mén, they are gods. But we teachers, who carry on 
a system of popular education which is by far the most complex 
and valuable invention of the nineteenth century, know that 
we have to do, not with the highly gifted units, but with the 
millions who are more or less capable of being cultivated by the 
long, patient, artificial training called education. For us and 
our system the genius is no standard, but the cultivated 
man is. To his stature we and many of our pupils may in time 
attain.

Matthew Arnold pointed out more than a generation ago, edu- 
cated mankind is governed by two passions+gone the passion 
for pure knowledge, the other the passion for being of service 
or doing. good. \ Mew, the passion for pure knowledge is to be 
gratified only through the scientific method of inquiry. In 
Arnold’s phrases, theyfirst step for every aspirant to culture is 
> to endeavor to see things as they are or “to learn, in short, 
the will of God.” {The second step is to make that will prevail, 
each in his own sphere of action and influence. {This recognition 
of science as pure knowledge, and of the scientific method as 
the universal method of inquiry, is the great addition made by 
the nineteenth century to the idea of culture. I need not say 
that within that century what we call science, pure and applied, 
has transformed the world as the scene of the human drama; 
and that it is this transformation which has compelled the © 
recognition of natural science as a fundamental necessity in 
liberal education.’ The most convinced exponents and advocates 
of humanism now recognize that science is the “paramount 
force of the modern as distinguished from the antique and the 
medieval spirit,” and that “an interpenetration of humanism 
with science and of science with humanism is the condition of 
the highest culture.” 
+ A second modification of the earlier idea of cultivation was 
advocated by Ralph Waldo Emerson more than two generations 
ago. yHe taught that the acquisition of some form of manual 
skill and_the practice of some form of manual labor were =~ 
sential elements of culture. This idea has more and more be- 
come accepted in the systematic education of youth; and if we 
include athletic sports among the desirable forms of manual 
skill and labor, we may say that during the last thirty years 
this element of excellence of body in the ideal ‘of education has 
had a rapid, even an exaggerated, development. The idea of 
some sort of bodily excellence was, to be sure, not absent in the 
old conception of the cultivated man. The gentleman could 
ride well, dance gracefully, and fence with skill. But the 
modern conception of bodily skill as an element in cultivation

is more comprehensive, and includes that habitual contact 
with the external world which Emerson deémed essential to 
real culture.t We have lately become convinced that accurate 
work with carpenters’ tools, or lathe, or hammer and anvil, or 
violin, or piano, or pencil, or crayon, or camel’s-hair brush, 
trains well the same nerves and ganglia with which we do what 
is ordinarily called thinking, We have also become convinced 
that some intimate, sympathetic acquaintance with the natural 
objects of the earth and sky adds greatly to the happiness of 
life, and that this acquaintance should be begun in childhood 
and be developed all through adolescence and maturity. A 
brook, a hedgerow, or a garden is an inexhaustible teacher of 
wonder, reverence, and love. yThe scientists insist to-day on 
nature study for children; but we teachers ought long ago to 
have learned from the poets the value of this element in educa- 
tion. They are the best advocates of nature study. If any 
here are not convinced of its worth, let them go to Theocritus, 
Virgil, Wordsworth, Tennyson, or Lowell for the needed dem- 
onstration. Let them observe, too, that a great need of modern 
industrial society is intellectual pleasures, or pleasures which, 
like music, combine delightful sensations with the gratifications 
of observation, association, memory, and sympathy. The idea 
of culture has always included a quick and wide sympathy 
- with inen; it should hereafter include sympathy with nature, 
_and particularly with its living forms, a sympathy based on 
some accurate observation of naturef” The bookworm, the 
** monk, the isolated student, has neve en the type of the 
‘cultivated man. Society has seemed the natural setting for 
the cultivated person, man or woman; but the present con- 
ception of real culture contains not only a large development 
of this social element, but‘ also an extension of interestvand 
reverence to the animate-creation and to those immense 
forces that set the earthly stage for man and all related 
beings. 
Let us now proceed to examine some of the changes in the 
idea of culture, or in the available means of culture, which the 
last hundred years have brought about.

YThe moral sense of the modern world makes character a 
more important element than it used to be in the ideal of a 
cultivated man. Now, character is formed, as Goethe said, in 
the j‘stream of the world”—not in Stillness) or isolation, but in 
the ee -flowing tides of the busy world, the world of nature 
and the world of mankind. At the end of the nineteenth cen- 
tury the world was wonderfully different from the world at 
the beginning of that eventful period; and, moreover, men’s 
means of making acquaintance with the world were vastly 
ampler than. they were a hundred years earlier. «To the old 
idea of culture some knowledge of history was indispensable. 
Now, history is a representation of the stream of the world, or 
of some little portion of that stream, one hundred, five hundred, 
two thousand years ago. Acquaintance with some part of the 
present stream ought to be more formative of character, and 
more instructive as regards external nature and the nature 
of man, than any partial survey of the stream that was flowing 
centuries ago. We have, then, through the present means of 
reporting the stream of the world from day to day, material for 
culture such as no preceding generation, of mem has possessed. 
-The cultivated man or woman must use the means which 
steam and electricity have provided for reporting the play of 
physical forces and of human volitions which make the world 
of to-day; for the world of to-day supplies in its immense variety 
a picture of all stages of human progress, from the stone age, 
through savagery, barbarism, and medievalism, to what we now 
call civilization. The rising generation should think hard, 
and feel keenly, just where the men and women who constitute 
the actual human world are thinking and feeling most to-day. 
The panorama of to-day’s events is not an accurate or complete 
pitture, for history will supply posterity with much evidence

theless an invaluable and a new means of developing good 
judgment, good feeling, and the passion for social service; or, 
in other words, of securing cultivation. But someone will say: which is hidden from the eyes of contemporaries; but it is never-- ,

* The stream of the world is foul. True in part. The stream 
is, what it has been, a mixture of foulness and purity, of mean- 
ness and majesty; but it has nourished individual virtue and 
race civilization. Literature and history are a similar mix- 
ture, and yet are the traditional means of culture. Are not 
‘ the Greek tragedies means of culture? Yet they are all full 
of incest, murder, and human sacrifices to lustful and revenge- 
ful gods. 
I 
A cultivated man should express himself by tongue or pen 
with some accuracy and elegance; therefore linguistic train- 
ing has had great importance in the idea of cultivation. The 
mditions of the educated world have, however, changed so 
profoundly since the revival of learning in Italy that our in- 
herited ideas concerning training in language and literature 
have required large modifications. In the year 1400 it might 
have been said with truth that thdie was but one language of 
scholars, the Latin, and but two great literatures, the Hebrew 
and the Greek. Since that time, however, other great literatures 
have arisen, the Italian, Spanish, French, German, and above all 
the English, which has become incomparably the most extensive 
and various and the noblest of literatures. Under these cir- 
cumstances it is impossible to maintain that a knowledge of any 
particular literature is indispensable to culture. Yet we cannot 
- but feel that the cultivated man ought to possess a considerable 
acquaintance with the literature of some great language, and 
the power to use the native language in a pure and interesting 
way. Thus, we are not sure that Robert Burns could be prop- 
erly described as a cultivated man, moving poet though he 
was. We do not think of Abraham Lincoln as a cultivated man, 
master of English speech and writing though he was. These 
men do not correspond to the type represented by the word 
“cultivated,” but belong in the class of geniuses ( When we 
ask ourselves why a knowledge of literature seems indispensable 
to the ordinary idea of cultivation, we find no answer. except 
this, that in literature are portrayed all human passions, desires,
-P-A-G-E-81
  
PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 59 
and aspirations, and that acquaintance with these human 
feelings, and with the means of portraying them, seems to us 
essential to culture. These human qualities arid powers are 
also the commonest ground of interesting human intercourse, 
and therefore literary knowledge exalts the quality and enhances 
the enjoyment of human intercourse. It is in conversation 
that cultivation tells as much as anywhere, and this rapid ex- 
change of thoughts is by far the commonest manifestation of its 
power/ Combine the knowledge of literature with knowledge 
of the “stream of the world,” and you have united two large 
sources of the influence of the cultivated person. r The linguistic 
and literary element in cultivation therefore abides, but has 
become vastly broader than formerly; so broad, indeed, that 
selection among its various fields is forced upon every educated 
youth. 
Il 
The next great element in cultivation to which I ask your 
attention is acquaintance with some part of the store of knowl- 
edge which humanity in its progress from barbarism has acquired 
and laid up... This is the prodigious store of seule rational- 
ized, and systematized discoveries, experiences, and ideas. This 
is the store which we teachers try to pass on to the rising genera- 
tion. The capacity to assimilate this store and improve it in 
each successive generation is the distinction of the human race 
over other animals. It is too vast for any man to master, though 
he had a hundred lives instead of one; and its growth in the 
nineteenth century was greater than in all the thirty preceding 
centuries put together. In the eighteenth century a diligent 
student, with quick powers of apprehension and strong memory, 
need not have despaired of mastering a large fraction of this 
store of knowledge. Long before the end of the nineteenth 
century such a task had become impossible. + Culture, therefore, 
can no longer imply a knowledge of everything—not even a 
little knowledge of everything. ,It must be content with general 
knowledge of some things, and a real mastery of some small por- 
tion of the human store. Here is a profound modification of 
.
-P-A-G-E-82
60 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
the idea of cultivation which the nineteenth century has brought 
about. What portion or portions of the infinite human store 
are most proper to the cultivated man? The answer must be: - 
Those which enable him, with his individual personal qualities, 
to deal best and sympathize most with nature and withtother 
human beings. It is here that the passion for service must 
fuse with the passion for knowledge. It is natural to imagirie 
that the young man who has acquainted himself with economics, 
the science of government, sociology, and the history of civiliza- 
tion in its motives, objects, and methods, has a better chance 
of fusing the passion for knowledge with the passion for doing 
good than the man whose passion for pure knowledge leads him 
to the study of chemical or physical phenomena, or of the habits 
and climatic distribution of plants or animals. Yet, so intri- 
cate are the relations of human beings to the animate and inani- 
mate creation that it is impossible to foresee with what realms 
of nature intense human interest may prove to be identified. 
Thus the generation now on the stage has suddenly learned that 
some of the most sensitive and exquisite human interésts, such 
as health or disease and life or death for those we love, are bound 
up with the life-histories of parasites on the blood corpuscles or 
of certain varieties of mosquitos and ticks. When the spectra 
of the sun, stars, and other lights began to be studied, there 
was not the slightest anticipation that a cure for one of the most 
horrible diseases to which mankind is liable might be found in the 
X-rays. While, then, we can still see that certain subjects 
afford more obvious or frequent access to means of doing good 
and to fortunate intercourse with our fellows than other subjects, 
we have learned from nineteenth-century experience that there 
is no field of real knowledge which may not suddenly prove con- 
tributory in a high degree to human happiness and the progress 
of civilization, and therefore acceptable as a worthy element in 
the truest culture. , 
IV 
The only other element in cultivation which time will per-. 
mit me to treat is the training of the constructive imagina-  
-P-A-G-E-83
XQ PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE ; 61 
tion.* The imagination is the greatest of human powers, no 
matter in what field it works-—in art or literature, in mechanical 
invention, in science, government, commerce, or religion; and 
the training of the imagination is, therefore, far the most im- 
portaiit part of education. ~I use the term “constructive imagi- 
nation” because that implies the creation or building of a new 
thing. The sculptor, for example, imagines or conceives the 
perfect form of a child ten years of age.- He has never seen such 
a thing, for a child perfect in form is never produced; he has 
only seen in different children the elements of perfection, here 
one element and there another. In his imagination he combines 
these elements of the perfect form, which he has only seen 
separated, and from this picture in his mind he carves the stone, 
and in the execution invariably loses his ideal—that is, falls 
short of it, or fails to express it. Sir Joshua Reynolds points 
out that the painter can picture only what he has somewhere - 
seen; but that the more he has seen and noted, the surer he is to 
be original in his painting, because his imaginary combinations 
will be original.+ Constructive imagination is the great power 
of the poet as well as of the artist; and the nineteenth century 
has convinced us that it is also the great power of the man of 
science, the investigator, and the natural philosopher. What 
gives every great naturalist or physicist his epoch-making results 
is precisely the imaginative power by which he deduces from 
masses of fact the guiding hypothesis or principle. 
The educated world needs to recognize the new varieties of 
constructive imagination. + Dante gave painful years to pictur- 
ing on many pages of his immortal comedy of hell, purgatory, 
and paradise the most horrible monsters and tortures, and the 
most loathsome and noisome abominations that his fervid 
imagination could concoct out of his own bitter experiences and 
the manners and customs of his cruel times. 4 Sir Charles Lyell 
spent many laborious years in searching for and putting to- 
gether the scattered evidences that the geological processes by 
which the crust of the earth has been made ready for the use 
of man have been, in the main, not catastrophic, but gradual 
and gentle; and that the forces which have been in action 
   
-P-A-G-E-84
  62 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
through past ages are, for the most part, similar to those we 
may see to-day eroding hills, cutting cafions, making placers, 
marshes, and meadows, and forming prairie and ocean floors. 
He first imagined, and then demonstrated, that the geologic 
agencies are not explosive and cataclysmal, but steady and 
patient. These two kinds of imagination—Dante’s and Lyell’s 
—are not comparable, but both are manifestations of great 
human power. Zola in La Béte humaine contrives that ten 
persons, all connected with the railroad from Paris to Havre, 
shall be either murderers, or murdered, or both, within eigh- 
teen months; and he adds-two railroad slaughters criminally 
procured. The conditions of time and place are ingeniously 
imagined, and no detail is omitted which can heighten the 
effect of the homicidal fiction. yContrast this kind of con- 
structive imagination with the kind which conceived the great 
‘wells sunk in the solid rock below Niagara that contain the 
turbines, that drive the dynamos, that generate the electric 
force that turns thousands of wheels and lights thousands of 
lamps over hundreds of square miles of adjoining territory; 
or with the kind which conceives the sending of human thoughts 
across three thousand miles of stormy sea instantaneously on 
nothing more substantial than ethereal waves. There is no 
crime, cruelty, or lust about these last two sorts of imagining. 
No lurid fire of hell or human passion illumines their scenes. 
They are calm, accurate, just, and responsible; and nothing 
but beneficence and increased human well-being results from 
them. There is going to be room in the hearts of twentieth- 
century men for a high admiration of these kinds of imagination, 
as well as for that of the poet, artist, or dramatist. 
Another kind of imagination deserves a moment’s considera- 
tion-4the receptive imagination which entertains and holds 
fast the visions genius creates or the analogies of nature suggest. 
A young woman is absorbed for hours in conning the squalid 
scenes and situations through which Thackeray portrays the 
malign motives and unclean soul of Becky Sharp. Another 
young woman watches for days the pairing, nesting, brooding; - 
and foraging of two robins that have established home and

family in the notch of a maple near her window.- She notes 
the unselfish labors of the father and mother for each other 
and for their little ones, and weaves into the simple drama 
all sorts of protective instincts and human affections. Here 
are two employments for the receptive imagination. + Shall 
systematic education compel the first, but make no room for 
the second? The increasing attention to nature study suggests 
the hope that the imaginative study of human ills and woes is 
not to be allowed to exclude the imaginative study of nature, 
and that both studies may count toward culture. 
‘It is one lesson of the nineteenth century, then, that in every 
field of human knowledge the constructive imagination finds 
play—in literature, in history, in theology, in anthropology, 
and in the whole field of physical and biological research. 
That great century has taught us that, on the whole, the scien- 
tific imagination is quite as productive for human service as 
the literary or poetic imagination. AThe imagination of Darwin 
or Pasteur, for example, is as high and productive a form of 
imagination as that of Dante, or Goethe, or even Shakespeare, 
if we regard the human uses which result from the exercise of 
imaginative powers, and mean by human uses not merely 
meat and drink, clothes and shelter, but also the satisfaction 
of mental and spiritual needs. We must, therefore, allow in 
our contemplation of the cultivated man a large expansion 
of the fields in which the cultivated imagination may be exer- 
cised. We must extend our training of the imagination beyond 
literature and the fine arts, to history, philosophy, science, 
government, and sociology. We must recognize the pro- 
digious variety of fruits of the imagination that the nineteenth 
century has given to our race. 
It results from this brief survey that the elements and means 
of cultivation are much more numerous than they_used to be; 
so that it is not wise to say of any one acquisition orfaculty: 
With it cultivation becomes possible; without it, impossible. 
The one acquisition or faculty may be immense, and yet cul- 
tivation may not have been attained. Thus, it is obvious that 
‘a man may have a wide acquaintance with music, and posséss
-P-A-G-E-86
  
64 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
great musical skill and that wonderful imaginative power 
which conceives delicious melodies and harmonies for the de- 
light of mankind through centuries, and yet not be a cultivated 
man in the ordinary acceptation of the words. We have met 
artists who were rude and uncouth, yet possessed a high de- 
gree of technical skill and strong powers of imagination. We 
have seen philanthropists and statesmen whose minds have 
played on great causes and great affairs, and yet who lacked 
a correct use of their native language, and had no historical 
perspective or background of historical knowledge. On the . 
other hand, is there any single acquisition or faculty which is 
essential to culture, except, indeed, a reasonably accurate and 
refined use of thé mother-tongue? Again, though we can 
discern in different individuals different elements of the per- 
fect type of cultivated man, we seldom find combined in any 
human being all the elements of the type. Here, as in painting 
or sculpture, we make up our ideal from traits picked out from 
many imperfect individuals and put together. We must not, 
therefore, expect systematic education to produce multitudes 
of highly cultivated and symmetrically developed persons; the 
multitudinous product will always be imperfect, just as there 
are no perfect trees, animals, flowers, or crystals. 
It has been my object this evening to point out that our con- 
ception of the type of cultivated man has been greatly enlarged, 
and on the whole exalted, by observation of the experiences 
of mankind during the last hundred years. yLet us as teachers 
accept no single element or kind of culture as the one essential; 
let us remember that the best fruits of real culture are_an open 
mind, broad sympathies, and respect for all the diverse achieve- 
ments of the human intellect at whatever stage of development 
they may actually be—the stage of fresh discovery, or bold 
exploration, or complete conquest. Let us remember that: the 
moral elements of the new education are individual choice of 
studies and career among a great, new variety of studies and’ 
careers, early responsibility accompanying this freedom of 
choice, love of truth now that truth may be directly sought 
through rational inquiry, and an omnipresent sense of social
-P-A-G-E-87
PURPOSE OF THE COLLEGE 65 
obligation. These moral elements are so strong that the new 
forms of culture are likely to prove themselves quite as pro- 
ductive of morality, high-mindedness, and idealism as the old. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. What impression seems to prevail among the people you have 
been thrown with in regard to the meaning of the phrases “culture” 
and “cultivated man’? Compare with the definition given in the 
selection of a truly cultivated man. 2. What two ideas have modi- 
fied our ideals of culture? Which of these might be said to have 
been the most influential? 3. What are the essentials of true culture 
as indicated in this selection? How far can you agree with the 
writer? 4. In connection with what is said in this selection about 
the constructive imagination, discuss the following statement, ‘“No- 
where is there more demand for imagination than in the formulation 
of a scientific hypothesis: the world, as science has constructed it, 
is the product of that faculty no less than a novel, a play, or an epic 
poem.” 5. Taking into consideration the views in regard to educa- 
tion expressed in this and the three preceding selections, formulate 
for yourself a view of the distinctive function of a college education. 
Is it, for example, (1) acquisition of knowledge, (2) development of 
mental powers, (3) development of character, (4) supplying the ideal 
element to life, (5) development of culture, (6) social efficiency, 
(7) training for business, or something more fundamental than these?

ON SCIENCE AND ART IN RELATION TO EDUCATION! 
Tuomas Henry HuxLey 
[Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-1895) was one of the great English scientists 
of the nineteenth century. As scientist, he made valuable contributions to 
scientific knowledge, and by his championing of Darwinism, did much to 
gain widespread acceptance for the evolutionary theory. Huxley also did 
much towards forwarding the cause of education. Not only was he interested 
in improving the existing methods of education in the sciences, but also in 
the larger problems of education as a national concern. The selection here 
given is an extract from an address delivered in 1882 at a meeting of the 
Liverpool Association.] 
I know quite well that launching myself into this discussion 
[of what the principal subjects of education ought to be] is a 
very dangerous operation; that it is a very large subject, and 
one which is difficult to deal with, however much I may trespass 
upon your patience in the time allotted to me. But the dis- 
cussion is so fundamental, it is so completely impossible to make 
up one’s mind on these matters until one has settled the ques- 
tion, that I will even venture to make the experiment. A great 
lawyer-statesman and philosopher of a former age—I mean 
Francis Bacon—said that truth came out of error much more 
rapidly than it came out of confusion. There is a wonderful 
truth in that saying. Next to being right in this world, the 
best of all things is to be clearly and definitely wrong, because 
you will come out somewhere. If you go buzzing about between 
right and wrong, vibrating and fluctuating, you come out no- 
where; but if you are absolutely and thoroughly and persistently 
wrong, you must, some of these days, have the extreme good

fortune of knocking your head against a fact, and that sets you 
all straight again. So I will not trouble myself as to whether 
I may be right or wrong in what I am about to say, but at any 
rate I hope to be clear and definite; and then you will be able 
to judge for yourselves whether, in following out the train of 
thought I have to introduce, you knock your heads against 
facts or not. 
I take it that the whole object of education is, in the first 
place, to train the faculties of the young in such a manner as 
to give their possessors the best chance of being happy and use- 
ful in their generation; and, in the second place, to furnish them 
with the most important portions of that immense capitalized 
experience of the human race which we call knowledge of various 
kinds. I am using the term knowledge in its widest possible 
sense; and thé question is, what subjects to select by training 
and discipline, in which the object I have just defined may be 
best attained. 
I must call your attention further to this fact, that all the 
subjects of our thoughts—all feelings and propositions (leaving 
aside our sensations as the mere materials and occasions of 
thinking and feeling), all our mental furniture—may be classi- 
fied under one of two heads—as either within the province of 
the intellect, something that can be put into propositions and 
affirmed or denied; or as within the province of feeling, or that 
which, before the name was defiled, was called the esthetic side 
of our nature, and which can neither be proved nor disproved, 
but only felt and known. 
According to the classification which I have put before you, 
then, the subjects of all knowledge are divisible into the two 
groups, matters of science and matters of art; for all things with 
which the reasoning faculty alone is occupied come under the 
province of science; and in the broadest sense, and not in the 
narrow and technical sense in which we are now accustomed to 
use the word art, all things feelable, all things which stir our 
emotions, come under the term of art, in the sense of the subject- 
matter of the esthetic faculty. So that we are shut up to this— 
that the business of education is, in the first place, to provide the
-P-A-G-E-90
68 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
young with the means and the habit of observation; and, second- 
ly, to supply the subject-matter of knowledge either in the 
shape of science or of art, or of both combined. 
Now, it is a very remarkable fact—but it is true of most 
things in this world—that there is hardly anything one-sided, 
or of one nature; and it is not immediately obvious what of the 
things that interest us may be regarded as pure science, and 
what may be regarded as pure art. It may be that there are 
some peculiarly constituted persons who, before they have 
advanced far into the depths of geometry, find artistic beauty 
about it; but, taking the generality of mankind, I think it may 
be said that, when they begin to learn mathematics, their whole 
souls are absorbed in tracing the connection between the pre- 
mises and the conclusion, and that to them geometry is pure 
science. So I think it may be said that mechanics and osteology 
are pure science. On the other hand, melody in music is pure 
art. You cannot reason about it; there is no proposition in- 
volved in it. So, again, in the pictorial art, an arabesque, or a 
“harmony in gray,” touches none but the esthetic faculty. 
But a great mathematician, and even many persons who are 
not great mathematicians, will tell you that they derive im- 
mense pleasure from geometrical reasonings. Everybody knows 
mathematicians speak of solutions and problems as “elegant,” 
and they tell you that a certain mass of mystic symbols is 
“beautiful, quite lovely.” Well, you do not see it. They do see 
it, because the intellectual process, the process of comprehending 
the reasons symbolized by these figures and these signs, confers 
upon them a sort of pleasure, such as an artist has in visual 
symmetry. Take a science of which I may speak with more 
confidence, and which is the most attractive of those I am con- 
cerned with. It is what we call morphology, which consists in 
tracing out the unity in variety of the infinitely diversified 
structures of animals and plants. I cannot give you any example 
of a thorough esthetic pleasure more intensely real than a 
pleasure of this kind—the pleasure which arises in one’s mind 
when a whole mass of different structures run into one harmony 
as the expression of a central law. That is where the province 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 69 
of art overlays and embraces the province of intellect. And, if 
I may venture to express an opinion on such a subject, the great 
majority of forms of art are not in the sense what I just now 
defined them to be—pure art; but they derive much of their 
quality from simultaneous and even unconscious excitement 
of the intellect. 
When I was a boy, I was very fond of music, and I am so 
now; and it so happened that I had the opportunity of hear- 
ing much good music. Among other things, I had abundant 
opportunities of hearing that great old master, Sebastian 
Bach. I remember perfectly well—though I knew nothing 
about music then, and, I may add, know nothing whatever 
about it now—the intense satisfaction and delight which I had 
in listening, by the hour together, to Bach’s fugues. It is a 
pleasure which remains with me, I am glad to think; but, of 
late years, I have tried to find out the why and wherefore, and 
it has often occurred to me that the pleasure derived from musical 
compositions of this kind is essentially of the same nature as 
that which is derived from pursuits which are commonly 
regarded as purely intellectual. I mean, that the source 
of pleasure is exactly the same as in most of my problems in 
morphology—that you have the theme in one of the old master’s 
works followed out in all its endless variations, always appear- 
ing and always reminding you of unity in variety. So in 
painting; what is called “truth to nature” is the intellectual - 
element coming in, and truth to nature depends entirely upon 
the intellectual culture of the person to whom art is addressed. 
If you are in Australia, you may get credit for being a good 
artist—I mean among the natives—if you can draw a kangaroo 
after a fashion. But, among men of higher civilization, the 
intellectual knowledge we possess brings its criticism into our 
appreciation of works of art, and we are obliged to satisfy it, as 
well as the mere sense of beauty in color and in outline. And 
so, the higher the culture and information of those whom art ad- 
dresses, the more exact and precise must be what we call its 
“truth to nature.” 
If we turn to literature, the same thing is true, and you

find works of literature which may be said to be pure art. 
A little song of Shakespeare or of Goethe is pure art; it is 
exquisitely beautiful, although its intellectual content may 
be nothing. A series of pictures is made to pass before your 
mind by the meaning of words, and the effect is a melody 
of ideas. Nevertheless, the great mass of the literature we 
esteem is valued, not merely because of having artistic form, 
but because of its intellectual content; and the value is the 
higher the more precise, distinct, and true is that intellectual 
‘content. And, if you will let me for a moment speak of the 
very highest forms of literature, do we not regard them as 
highest simply because the more we know the truer they seem, 
and the more competent we are to appreciate beauty the 
more beautiful they are? No man ever understands Shake- 
speare until he is old, though the youngest may admire him, 
the reason being that he satisfies the artistic instinct of the 
youngest and harmonizes with the ripest and richest experience 
of the oldest. 
I have said this much to draw your attention to what, in 
my mind, lies at the root of all this matter, and at the under- 
standing of one another by the men of science on the one 
hand, and the men of literature, and history, and art, on the 
other. It is not a question whether one order of study or 
another should predominate. It is a question of what topics 
of education you shall select which will combine all the needful 
elements in such due proportion as to give the greatest amount 
of food, support, and encouragement to those faculties which 
enable us to appreciate truth, and to profit by those sources 
of innocent happiness which are open to us, and, at the same 
time, to.avoid that which is bad, and coarse, and ugly, and 
keep clear of the multitude of pitfalls and dangers which beset 
those who break through the natural or moral laws. 
I address myself, in this spirit, to the consideration of the 
question of the value of purely literary education. Is it good 
and sufficient, or is it insufficient and bad? Well, here I ven- 
ture to say that there are literary educations and literary edu- 
cations. If I am to understand by that term the education
-P-A-G-E-93

that was current in the great majority of middle-class schools, 
and upper schools too, in this country when I was a boy, and 
which consisted absolutely and almost entirely in keeping 
boys for eight or ten years at learning the rules of Latin and 
Greek grammar, construing certain Latin and Greek authors, 
and possibly’ making verses which, had they been English 
verses, would have been condemned as abominable doggerel,— 
if that is what you mean by liberal education, then I say it is 
scandalously insufficient and almost worthless. My reason for 
saying so is not from the point of view of science at all, but 
from the point of view of literature. I say the thing professes 
to be literary education that is not a literary education at 
all. It was not literature at all that was taught, but science 
in a very bad form. It is quite obvious that grammar is sci- 
ence and not literature. The analysis of a text by the help 
of the rules of grammar is just as much a scientific opera- 
tion as the analysis of a chemical compound by the help of 
the rules of chemical analysis. There is nothing that appeals 
to the esthetic faculty in that operation; and I ask multi- 
tudes of men of my own age, who went through this process, 
whether they ever had a conception of art or literature until 
they obtained it for themselves after leaving school? Then 
you may say, “If that is so, if the education was scientific, 
why cannot you be satisfied with it?” I say, because al- 
though it is a scientific training, it is of the most inadequate 
and inappropriate kind. If there is any good at all in scientific 
education it is that men should be trained, as I said before, 
to know things for themselves at first hand, and that they 
should understand every step of the reason of that which they do. 
I desire to speak with the utmost respect of that science— 
philology—of which grammar is a part and parcel; yet every- 
body knows that grammar, as it is usually learned at school, 
affords no scientific training. It is taught just as you would 
teach the rules of chess or drafts. On the other hand, if I 
am to understand by a literary education the study of the 
literatures of either ancient or modern nations—but especially 
those of antiquity, and especially that of ancient Greece;
-P-A-G-E-94
  
72 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
if this literature is studied, not merely from the point of view 
of philological science, and its practical application to the 
interpretation of texts, but as an exemplification of and com- 
mentary upon the principles of art; if you look upon the liter- 
ature of a people as a chapter in the development of the human 
mind, if you work out this in a broad spirit, and with such 
collateral references to morals and politics, and physical geog- 
raphy, and the like as are needful to make you comprehend 
what the meaning of ancient literature and civilization is,—then, 
assuredly, it affords a splendid and noble education. But 
I still think it is susceptible of improvement, and that no 
man will ever comprehend the real secret of the difference 
between the ancient world and our present time unless he 
has’ learned to see the difference which the late development 
of physical science has made between the thought of this day 
and the thought of that, and he will never see that difference 
unless he has some practical insight into some branches of 
physical science; dnd you must remember that a literary edu- 
cation such as that which I have just referred to is out of* 
the reach of those whose school life is cut short at sixteen or 
seventeen. bs , 
But, you will say, all this is fault-finding; let us hear what 
you have in the way of positive suggestion. Then I am bound 
to tell you that, if I could make a clean sweep of everything— 
Iam very glad I cannot because I might, and probably should, 
make mistakes,—but if I could make a clean sweep of everything 
and start afresh, I should, in the first place, secure that training 
of the young in reading and writing, and in the habit of attention 
and observation, both to that which is told them, and that which 
they see, which everybody agrees to. But, in addition to that, 
Ishould make it absolutely necessary for everybody, for a longer 
or shorter period, to learn to draw. Now, you may say, there 
are some people who cannot draw, however much they may be 
taught. I deny that im toto, because I never yet met with any- 
body who could not learn to write. Writing is a form of draw- 
ing; therefore if you give the same attention and trouble to 
drawing as you do to writing, depend upon it, there is nobody
-P-A-G-E-95
  
THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 73 
who cannot be made to draw, more or less well Do not mis- 
apprehend me. I do not say for one moment you would make 
an artistic draftsman. Artists are not made; they grow. 
You may improve the natural faculty in that direction, but you 
cannot make it; but you can teach simple drawing, and you will 
find it an implement of learning of extreme value. I do not 
think its value can be exaggerated, because it gives you the 
means of training the young in attention and accuracy, which 
are the two things in which all mankind are more deficient than 
in any other mental quality whatever. The whole of my life 
has been spent in trying te,give my proper attention to things 
and to be accurate, and I have not succeeded as well as I could 
wish; and other people, I am afraid, are not much more fortunate. 
You cannot begin this habit too early,:and I consider there is 
nothing of so great a value as the habit of drawing to secure 
those two desirable ends. ee 
Then we come to the subject-matter, whether scientific or 
esthetic, of education, and I should naturally have no question 
at all about teaching the elements of physical science of the 
kind I have sketched, in a practical manner; but among scien- 
tific topics, using the word scientific in the broadest sense, I 
would also include the elements of the theory of morals and of 
that of political and social life, which, strangely enough, it 
never seems to occur to anybody to teach a child. I would have 
the history of our own country, and of all the influences which 
have been brought to bear upon it, with incidental geography, 
not as a mere chronicle of reigns and battles, but as a chapter 
in the development of the race, and the history of civili- 
zation. 
Then with respect to esthetic knowledge and discipline, we 
have happily in the English language one of the most magnificent 
storehouses of artistic beauty and of models of literary excel- 
lence which exists in the world at the present time. I have 
said before, and I repeat it here, that if a man cannot get literary 
culture of the highest kind out of his Bible, and Chaucer, and 
Shakespeare, and Milton, and Hobbes, and Bishop Berkeley, to 
mention only a few of our illustrious writers—I say, if he cannot
-P-A-G-E-96
  44 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
get it out of those writers, he cannot get it out of anything; and 
I would assuredly devote a very large portion of the time of 
every English child to the careful study of the models of English 
writing of such varied and wonderful kind as we possess, and, 
what is still more important and still more neglected, the habit 
of using that language with precision, with force, and with art. 
I fancy we are almost the only nation in the world who seem to 
think that composition comes by nature. The French attend 
to their own language, the Germans study theirs; but English- 
men do not seem to think it is worth their while. Nor would 
I fail to include, in the course of study I am sketching, transla- 
tions of all the best works of antiquity, or of the modern world. 
It is a very desirable thing to read Homer in Greek; but if you 
don’t happen to know Greek, the next best thing we can do is to 
tread as good a translation of it as we have recently been fur- 
nished with in prose. You won’t get all you would get from the 
original, but you may get a great deal; and to refuse to know 
this great deal because you cannot get all, seems to be as sensible 
as for a hungry man to refuse bread because he cannot get 
partridge. Finally, I would add instruction in either music or 
painting, or if the child should be so unhappy, as sometimes 
happens, as to have no faculty for either of those, and no possi- 
bility of doing anything in any artistic sense with them, then I 
would see what could be done with literature alone; but I would 
provide, in the fullest sense, for the development of the esthetic 
side of the mind. In my judgment, those are all the essentials 
of education for an English child. With that outfit, such as 
it might be made in the time given to education which is within 
the reach of nine-tenths of the population—with that outfit, an 
Englishman, within the limits of English life, is fitted to go 
anywhere, to occupy the highest positions, to fill the highest 
offices of the State, and to become distinguished in practical 
pursuits, in science, or in art. For, if he have the opportunity 
to learn all those things, and have his mind disciplined in the 
various directions the teaching of those topics would have neces- 
sitated, then, assuredly, he will be able to pick up, on his road 
through life, all the rest of the intellectual baggage he wants.
-P-A-G-E-97
THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 75 
If the educational time at our disposition were sufficient there 
are one or two things I would add to those I have just now 
called the essentials; and perhaps you will be surprised to hear, 
though I hope you will not, that I should add, not more science, 
but one, or, if possible, two languages. The knowledge of some 
other language than one’s own is, in fact, of singular intellectual 
value. Many of the faults and mistakes of the ancient philoso- 
phers are traceable to the fact that they knew no language 
but their own, and were often led into confusing the symbol 
with the thought which it embodied. I think it is Locke who 
says that one-half of the mistakes of philosophers have arisen 
from questions about words; and one of the safest ways of 
delivering yourself from the bondage of words is to know how 
ideas look in words to which you are not accustomed. That is 
one reason for the study of language; another reason is that it 
opens new fields in art and in science. Another is the practical 
value of such knowledge; and yet another is this, that if your 
languages are properly chosen, from the time of learning the 
additional languages you will know your own language better 
than ever you did. So, I say, if the time given to education 
permits, add Latin and German. Latin, because it is the key 
to nearly one-half of English and to all the Romance languages; 
and German, because it is the key to almost all the remainder 
of English, and helps you to understand a race from whom most 
of us have sprung, and who have a character and a literature of 
a fateful force in the history of the world, such as probably has 
been allotted to those of no other people, except the Jews, the 
Greeks, and ourselves. Beyond these, the essential and the 
eminently desirable elements of all education, let each man take 
up his special line—the historian devote himself to his history, 
the man of science to his science, the man of letters to his cul- 
ture of that kind, and the artist to his special pursuit. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. Comment on the adequacy of Huxley’s statement of the object _ 
of education on page 67. 2. Discuss the basis of his distinction be- 
tween science and art. 3. Although such a broad distinction may

  76 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
have its value as a rough and ready classification, yet is it altogether 
true? Consider whether the popular conception of the scientist as 
a man with great command of his intellect and the artist with great 
command of his imagination and feeling is not very much at variance 
with the teaching of modern psychology that the faculties of emo- 
tion, reason, imagination are present together in every act of thought. 
Does not the scientist have much need for imagination in the con- 
struction of his hypotheses? Does not the artist need intellect in 
the structural side of his works? 4. Attempt a classification of the 
studies offered in your college according to Huxley’s distinction be- 
tween science and art. 5. Take issue with, or defend, Huxley’s 
statement of the principal subjects of education. Compare his ideas 
with those of Meiklejohn in The Aims of the Liberal College, page 49.

At other times, and in other places, I have endeavored 
to state the higher and more abstract arguments, by which 
the study of physical science may be shown to be indispen- 
sable to the complete training of the human mind; but I do 
not wish it to be supposed that, because I happen to be de- 
voted to more or less abstract and ‘“unpractical” pursuits, 
I am insensible to the weight which ought to be attached 
to that which has been said to be the English conception of 
Paradise—namely, “getting on.” I look upon it, that “getting 
on” is a very important matter indeed. I do not mean merely 
for the sake of the coarse and tangible results of success, but 
because humanity is so constituted that a vast number of us 
would never be impelled to those stretches of exertion which 
make us wiser and more capable men, if it were not for the 
absolute necessity of putting on our faculties all the strain

-P-A-G-E-99
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 77 
they will bear, for the purpose of “getting on” in the most 
practical sense. 
Now the value of a knowledge of physical science as a means 
of getting on is indubitable. There are hardly any of our 
trades, except the merely huckstering ones, in which some knowl- 
edge of science may not be directly profitable to the pursuer 
of that occupation. As industry attains higher stages of its 
development, as its processes become more complicated and 
refined, and competition more keen, the sciences are dragged 
in, one by one, to take their share in the fray; and he who 
can best avail himself of their help is the man who will come 
out uppermost in that ‘struggle for existence, which goes on as 
fiercely beneath the smooth surface of modern society as 
among the wild inhabitants of the woods. 
But in addition to the bearing of science on ordinary prac- 
tical life, let me direct your attention to its immense influence 
on several of the professions. I ask anyone who has adopted 
the calling of an engineer, how much time he lost when he 
left school, because he had to devote himself to pursuits which 
were absolutely novel and strange, and of which he had not 
obtained the remotest conception from his instructors? He 
had to familiarize himself with ideas of the course and powers 
of Nature, to which his attention had never been directed 
during his school-life, and to learn, for the first time, what a 
world of facts lies outside and beyond the world of words. 
I appeal to those who know what engineering is to say how 
far I am right in respect to that profession; but with regard 
to another, of no less importance, I shall venture to speak of my 
own knowledge. There is no one of us who may not at any 
moment be thrown, bound hand and foot by physical in- 
capacity, into the hands of a medical practitioner. The chances 
of life and death for all and each of us may, at any moment, 
depend on the skill with which that practitioner is able to 
make out what is wrong in our bodily frames, and on his ability 
to apply the proper remedy to the defect. 
The necessities of modern life are such, and the class from 
which the medical profession is chiefly recruited is so situ- 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  78 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
ated, that few medical men can hope to spend more than 
three or four, or it may be five, years in the pursuit of those 
studies which are immediately germane to physic. How is 
that all too brief period spent at present? I speak as an 
old examiner, having served some eleven or twelve years in 
that capacity in the University of London, and therefore 
having a practical acquaintance with the subject; but I might 
fortify myself by the authority of the President of the College 
of Surgeons, Mr. Quain, whom I heard the other day in an 
admirable address (the Hunterian Oration) deal fully and 
wisely with this very topic. 
A young man commencing the study of medicine is at once 
required to endeavor to make an acquaintance with a num- 
ber of sciences, such as Physics, as Chemistry, as Botany, 
as Physiology, which are absolutely and entirely strange to 
him, however excellent his so-called education at school may 
have been. Not only is he devoid of all apprehension of scien- 
tific conceptions, not only does he fail to attach any meaning 
to the words “matter,” “force,” or “law” in their scientific 
sense, but, worse still, he has no notion of what it is to come 
into contact with Nature, or to lay his mind alongside of a 
physical fact, and try to conquer it, in the way our great naval 
hero told his captains to master their enemies. His whole mind 
has been given to books, and I am hardly exaggerating if I 
say that they are more real to him than Nature. He imagines 
that all knowledge can be got out of books, and rests upon 
the authority of some master or other; nor does he entertain 
any misgiving that the method of learning which led to pro- 
ficiency in the rules of grammar will suffice to lead him to a 
mastery of the laws of Nature. The youngster, thus unpre- 
pared for serious study, is turned loose among his medical 
studies, with the result, in nine cases out of ten, that the first 
year of his curriculum is spent in learning how to learn. In- 
deed, he is lucky if, at the end of the first year, by the exer- 
tions of his teachers and his own industry, he has acquired 
even that art of arts. After which there remain not more than 
three, or perhaps four, years for the profitable study of such vast 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
    THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 79 
sciences as Anatomy, Physiology, Therapeutics, Medicine, 
Surgery, Obstetrics, and the like, upon his knowledge or ig- 
norance of which it depends whether the practitioner shall 
diminish, or increase, the bills of mortality. Now what is it 
but the preposterous condition of ordinary school education 
which prevents a young man of seventeen, destined for the 
practice of medicine, from being fully prepared for the study 
of Nature; and from coming to the medical school equipped 
with that preliminary knowledge of the principles of Physics, 
of Chemistry and of Biology, upon which he has now to waste 
one of the precious years, every moment of which ought to 
be given to those studies which bear directly upon the knowl- 
edge of his profession? 
There is another profession, to the members of which, I 
think, a certain preliminary knowledge of physical science 
might be quite as valuable as to the medical man. The prac- 
titioner of medicine sets before himself the noble object of 
taking care of man’s bodily welfare; but the members of this 
other profession undertake to ‘“‘minister to minds diseased,” 
and, so far as may be, to diminish sin and soften sorrow. Like 
the medical profession, the clerical, of which I now speak, 
rests its power to heal upon its knowledge of the order of the 
universe—upon certain theories of man’s relation to that 
which lies outside him. It is not my business to express any 
opinion about these theories. I merely wish to point out 
that, like all other theories, they are professedly based upon 
matters of fact. Thus the clerical profession has to deal with 
the facts of Nature from a certain point of view; and hence 
it comes into contact with that of the man of science, who 
has to treat the same facts from another point of view. You 
know how often that contact is to be described as collision, 
or violent friction; and how great the heat, how little the 
light, which commonly results from it. 
In the interests of fair play, to say nothing of those of man- 
kind, I ask, Why do not the clergy as a body acquire, as a 
part of their preliminary education, some such tincture of 
physical science as will put them in a position to understand 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  80 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
-the difficulties in the way of accepting their theories, which 
are forced upon the mind of every thoughtful and intelligent 
man, who has taken the trouble to instruct himself in the 
elements of natural knowledge? .. . 
I hope you will consider that the arguments I have now 
stated, even if there were no better ones, constitute a sufficient 
apology for urging the introduction of science into schools. 
The next question to which I have to address myself is, What 
sciences ought to be thus taught? And this is one of the most 
important of questions, because my side (I am afraid I am a 
terribly candid friend) sometimes spoils its cause by going in for 
too much. There are other forms of culture beside physical 
science; and I should be profoundly sorry to see the fact for- 
gotten, or even to observe a tendency to starve, or cripple, liter- 
ary, or esthetic, culture for the sake of science. Such a narrow 
view of the nature of education has nothing to do with my firm 
conviction that a complete and thorough scientific culture ought 
to be introduced into all schools. By this, however, I do not 
mean that every schoolboy should be taught everything in 
science. That would be a very absurd thing to conceive, and 
a very mischievous thing to attempt. What I mean is, that no 
boy or girl should leave school without possessing a grasp of 
the general character of science, and without having been dis- 
ciplined, more or less, in the methods of all sciences; so that, 
when turned into the world to make their own way, they shall 
be prepared to face scientific problems, not by knowing at once 
the conditions of every problem, or by being able at once to solve 
it; but by being familiar with the general current of scientific 
thought, and by being able to apply the methods of science in 
the proper way, when they have acquainted themselves with 
the conditions of the special problem. 
That is what I understand by scientific education. To fur- 
nish a boy with such an education, it is by no means necessary 
that he should devote his whole school existence to physical 
science: in fact, no one would lament so one-sided a proceeding 
more than I. Nay more, it is not necessary for him to give up 
more than a moderate share of his time to such studies, if they
-P-A-G-E-103
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM ‘8r 
be properly selected and arranged, and if he be trained in them. 
in a fitting manner. 
I conceive the proper course to be somewhat as follows. Ti 
begin with, let every child be instructed in those general views 
of the phenomena of Nature for which we have no exact English 
name. The nearest approximation to a name for what I mean, 
which we possess, is “physical geography.”” The Germans have 
a better, “Erdkunde” (“earth knowledge” or “geology” in its 
etymological sense), that is to say, a general knowledge of the 
earth, and what is on it, in it, and about it. If anyone who has 
had experience of the ways of young children will call to mind 
their questions, he will find that so far as they can be put into 
any scientific category, they come under this head of ‘“Erd- 
kunde.” The child asks, “What is the moon, and why does 
it shine?” ‘What is this water, and where does it run?” 
“What is the wind?” “What makes this wave in the sea?” 
“Where does this animal live, and what is the use of that plant?” 
And if not snubbed and stunted by being told not to ask foolish 
questions, there is no limit to the intellectual craving of a young 
child; nor any bounds to the slow, but solid, accretion of 
knowledge and development of the thinking faculty in this way. 
To all such questions, answers which are necessarily incomplete, 
though true as far as they go, may be given by any teacher 
whose ideas represent real knowledge and not mere book learn- 
ing; and a panoramic view of Nature, accompanied by a strong 
infusion of the scientific habit of mind, may thus be placed with- 
in the reach of every child of nine.or ten. 
After this preliminary opening of the eyes to the great spec- 
tacle of the daily progress of Nature, as the reasoning faculties of 
the child grow, and he becomes familiar with the use of the 
tools of knowledge—reading, writing, and elementary mathe- 
matics—he should pass on to what is, in the more strict sense, 
physical science. Now there are two kinds of physical science: 
the one regards form and the relation of forms to one another; 
the other deals with causes and effects. In many of what we 
term sciences, these two kinds are mixed up together; but sys- 
tematic botany is a pure example of the former kind, and physics 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  82 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
of the latter kind, of science. Every educational advantage 
which training in physical science can give is obtainable from 
the proper study of these two; and I should be contented, for 
the present, if they, added to our “Erdkunde,” furnished the 
whole of the scientific curriculum of school. Indeed, I conceive 
it would be one of the greatest boons which could be conferred 
upon England, if henceforward every child in the country were 
instructed in the general knowledge of the things about it, 
in the elements of physics, and of botany. But I should be still 
better pleased if there could be added somewhat of chemistry, 
and an elementary acquaintance with human physiology. 
So far as school education is concerned, I want to go no 
further just now; and I believe that such instruction would 
make an excellent introduction to that preparatory scientific 
training which, as I have indicated, is so essential for the suc- 
cessful pursuit of our most important professions. But this 
modicum of instruction must be so given as to insure real 
knowledge and practical discipline. If scientific education is 
to be dealt with as mere bookwork, it will be better not to 
attempt it, but to stick to the Latin Grammar which makes 
no pretense to be anything but bookwork. 
If the great benefits of scientific training are sought, it is 
essential that such training should be real: that is to say, that 
the mind of the scholar should be brought into direct relation 
with fact, that he should not merely be told a thing, but made 
to see by the use of his own intellect and ability that the thing 
is so and not otherwise. The great peculiarity of scientific 
training, that in virtue of which it cannot be replaced by any 
other discipline whatsoever, is this bringing of the mind directly 
into contact with fact, and practising the intellect in the com- 
pletest form of induction; that is to say, in drawing conclusions 
from particular facts made known by immediate observation 
of Nature. 
The other studies which enter into ordinary education do not 
discipline the mind in this way. Mathematical training is al- 
most purely deductive. The mathematician starts with a few 
simple propositions, the proof of which is so obvious that they 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 83 
are called self-evident, and the rest of his work consists of subtle 
deductions from them. The teaching of languages, at any rate 
as ordinarily practised, is of the same general nature,—authority 
and tradition furnish the data, and the mental operations of the 
scholar are deductive. 
Again: if history be the subject of study, the facts are still 
taken upon the evidence of tradition and authority. You 
cannot make a boy see the battle of Thermopyle for himself, 
or know, of his own knowledge, that Cromwell once ruled Eng- 
land. There is no getting into direct contact with natural 
fact by this road; there is no dispensing with authority, but 
rather a resting upon it. 
In all these respects, science differs from other educational 
discipline, and prepares the scholar for common life. What 
have we to do in every-day life? Most of the business which 
demands our attention is matter of fact, which needs, in the 
first place, to be accurately observed or apprehended; in the 
second, to be interpreted by inductive and deductive reason- 
ings, which are altogether similar in their nature to, those 
employed in science. In the one case, as in the other, whatever 
is taken for granted is so taken at one’s own peril; fact and 
reason are the ultimate arbiters, and patience and honesty 
are the great helpers out of difficulty. 
But if scientific training is to yield its most eminent re- 
sults, it must, I repeat, be made practical. That is to say, 
in explaining to a child the general phenomena of Nature 
you must, as far as possible, give reality to your teaching 
by object-lessons; in teaching him botany, he must handle 
the plants and dissect the flowers for himself; in teaching him 
physics and chemistry, you must not be solicitous to fill him 
with information, but you must be careful that what he learns 
he knows of his own knowledge. Don’t be satisfied with tell- 
ing him that a magnet attracts iron. Let him see that it does; 
let him feel the pull of the one upon the other for himself. 
And, especially, tell him that it is his duty to doubt until he 
is compelled, by the absolute authority of Nature, to believe 
that which is written in books. Pursue this discipline care-

fully and conscientiously, and you may make sure that, how- 
ever scanty may be the measure of information which you 
have poured into the boy’s mind, you have created an intel- 
lectual habit of priceless value in practical life. 
One is constantly asked, When should this scientific edu- 
cation be commenced? I should say with the dawn of intel- 
ligence. As I have already said, a child seeks for informa- 
tion about matters of physical science as soon as it begins to 
talk. The first teaching it wants is an object-lesson of one 
sort or another; and as soon as it is fit for systematic instruc- 
tion of any kind, it is fit for a modicum of science. 
People talk of the difficulty of teaching young children 
such matters, and in the same breath insist upon their learn- 
ing their Catechism, which contains propositions far harder 
to comprehend than anything in the educational course I 
have proposed. Again: I am incessantly told that we, who 
advocate the introduction of science in schools, make no al- 
lowance for the stupidity of the average boy or girl; but, in 
my belief, that stupidity, in nine cases out of ten, “fit, non 
nascitur,” * and is developed by a long process of parental and 
pedagogic repression of the natural intellectual appetites, 
accompanied by a persistent attempt to create artificial ones 
for food which is not only tasteless, but essentially indigest- 
ible. 
Those who urge the difficulty of instructing young people 
in science are apt to forget another very important condition 
of success—important in all kinds of teaching, but. most es- 
sential, I am disposed to think, when the scholars are very 
young. This condition is, that the teacher should himself 
really and practically know his subject. If he does, he will 
be able to speak of it in the easy language, and with the com- 
pleteness of conviction, with which he talks of any ordinary 
every-day matter. If he does not, he will be afraid to wander 
beyond the limits of the technical phraseology which he has 
got up; and a dead dogmatism, which oppresses, or raises 
opposition, will take the place of the lively confidence, born 
\Made, not born. 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 85 
of personal conviction, which cheers and encourages the emi- 
nently sympathetic mind of childhood. 
I have already hinted that such scientific training as we 
seek for may be given without making any extravagant claim 
upon the time now devoted to education. We ask only for 
“a most favored nation” clause in our treaty with the school- 
master; we demand no more than that science shall have 
as much time given to it as any other single subject—say four 
hours a week in each class of an ordinary school. 
For the present, I think men of science would be well con- 
tent with such an arrangement as this; but speaking for my- 
self, I do not pretend to believe that such an arrangement 
can be, or will be, permanent. In these times the educa- 
tional tree seems to me to have its roots in the air, its leaves 
and flowers in the ground; and, I confess, I should very much 
like to turn it upside down, so that its roots might be solidly 
imbedded among the facts of Nature, and draw thence a sound 
nutriment for the foliage and fruit of literature and of art. 
No educational system can have a claim to permanence, unless 
it recognizes the truth that education has two great ends 
to which everything else must be subordinated. The one of 
these is to increase knowledge; the other is to develop the 
love of right and the hatred of wrong. 
With wisdom and uprightness a nation can make its way 
worthily, and beauty will follow in the footsteps of the two, 
even if she be not especially invited; while there is perhaps 
no sight in the whole world more saddening and revolting 
than is offered by men sunk in ignorance of everything but 
what other men have written; seemingly devoid of moral 
belief or guidance; but with the sense of beauty so keen, and 
the power of expression so cultivated, that their sensual cater- 
wauling may be almost mistaken for the music of the spheres. 
At present, education is almost entirely devoted to the 
cultivation of the power of expression, and of the sense of 
literary beauty. The matter of having anything to say, be- 
yond a hash of other people’s opinions, or of possessing any 
criterion of beauty, so that we may distinguish between the

' Godlike and the devilish, is left aside as of no moment. I 
think I do not err in saying that if science were made a foun- 
dation of education, instead of being, at most, stuck on as 
cornice to the edifice, this state of things could not exist. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
As this selection and the one that follows are intended to be studied 
together as discussion of the value of scientific studies, topics for 
discussion covering both selections are given on page 94. 
THE CULTURAL VALUE OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE! 
Tuomas Henry HUXLEY 
[For note about the author see page 66. The selection here given is the 
latter part on the address entitled On the Advisableness of Improving Natural 
Knowledge, delivered in 1866, in St. Martin’s Hall, London.] 
But spinning jenny and steam pump are, after all, but 
toys, possessing an accidental value; and natural knowledge 
creates multitudes of more subtle contrivances, the praises 
of which do not happen to be sung because they are not di- 
rectly convertible into instruments for creating wealth. When 
I contemplate natural knowledge squandering such gifts among 
men, the only appropriate comparison I can find for her is 
to liken her to such a peasant woman as one sees in the Alps, 
striding ever upward, heavily burdened, and with mind bent 
only on her home; but yet without effort and without thought 
knitting for her children. Now stockings are good and com- 
fortable things, and the children will undoubtedly be much 
the better for them; but surely it would be short-sighted, to 
say the least of it, to depreciate this toiling mother as a mere 
stocking-machine—a mere provider of physical comforts. 
However, there are blind leaders of the blind, and not a 
few of them, who take this view of natural knowledge, and 
1 Reprinted from Science and Education, Volume IIL of Huxley’s Collected Essays, 
D. Appleton & Co.  
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 87 
can see nothing in the bountiful mother of humanity but a 
sort of comfort-grinding machine. According to them, the 
improvement of natural knowledge always has heen, and 
always must be, synonymous with no more than the improve- 
ment of the material resources, and the increase of the grati- 
fications of men. : 
Natural knowledge is, in their eyes, no real mother of man- 
kind, bringing them up with kindness, and, if need be, with 
sternness, in the way they should go, and instructing them 
in all things needful for their welfare; but a sort of fairy god- 
mother, ready to furnish her pets with shoes of swiftness, 
swords of sharpness, and omnipotent Aladdin’s lamps, so that 
they may have telegraphs to Saturn, and see the other side 
of the moon, and thank God they are better than their be- 
nighted ancestors. 
If this talk were true, I, for one, should not greatly care 
to toil in the service of natural knowledge. I think I would 
just as soon be quietly chipping my own flint axe, after the 
manner of my forefathers a few thousand years back, as be 
troubled with the endless malady of thought which now in- 
fests us all, for such reward. But I venture to say that such 
views are contrary alike to reason and to fact. Those who 
discourse in such fashion seem to me to be so intent upon 
trying to see what is above Nature, or what is behind her, 
that they are blind to what stares them in the face in her. 
I should not venture to speak thus strongly if my justi- 
fication were not to be found in the simplest and most ob- 
vious facts,—if it needed more than an appeal,.to the most 
notorious truths to justify my assertion, that the improvement 
of natural knowledge, whatever direction it has taken, and 
however low the aims of those who may have commenced 
it—has not only conferred practical benefits on men, but, 
in so doing, has effected a revolution in their conceptions of 
the universe and of themselves, and has profoundly altered 
their modes of thinking and their views of right and wrong. 
I say that natural knowledge, seeking to satisfy natural wants, 
has found the ideas which can alone still spiritual cravings.
-P-A-G-E-110
88 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
I say that natural knowledge, in desiring to ascertain the 
laws of comfort, has been driven to discover those of conduct, 
and to lay the foundations of a new morality. 
Let us take these points separately; and first, what great 
ideas has natural knowledge introduced into men’s minds? 
I cannot but think that the foundations of all natural knowl- 
edge were laid when the reason of man first came face to face 
with the facts of Nature; when the savage first learned that 
the fingers of one hand are fewer than those of both; that it 
is shorter to cross a stream than to head it; that a stone stops 
where it is unless it be moved, and that it drops from the hand 
which lets it go; that light and heat come and go with the 
sun; that sticks burn away in a fire; that plants and animals 
grow and die; that if he struck his fellow savage a blow he 
would make him angry, and perhaps get a blow in return, 
while if he offered him a fruit he would please him, and per- 
haps receive a fish in exchange. When men had acquired 
this much knowledge, the outlines, rude though they were, of 
mathematics, of physics, of chemistry, of biology, of moral, 
economical, and political science, were sketched. Nor did the 
germ of religion fail when science began to bud. Listen to 
words which, though new, are yet three thousand years old:— 
fs . When in heaven the stars about the moon 
Look ‘beautiful, when all the winds are laid, 
And every height comes out, and jutting peak 
And valley, and the immeasurable heavens 
Break open to their highest, and all the stars 
Shine, and the shepherd gladdens in his heart.” ! 
If the half savage Greek could share our feelings thus far, it 
is irrational to doubt that he went further, to find as we do, 
that upon that brief gladness there follows a certain sorrow,— 
the little light of awakened human intelligence shines so mere 
a spark amidst the abyss of the unknown and unknowable; 
seems so insufficient to do more than illuminate the imper- 
fections that cannot be remedied, the aspirations that cannot 
be realized, of man’s own nature. But in this sadness, this 
1 Need it be said that this is Tennyson’s English for Homer’s Greek? [Author's note.] 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  
THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 89 
consciousness of the limitation of man, this sense of an open 
secret which he cannot penetrate, lies the essence of all re- 
ligion; and the attempt to embody it in the forms furnished 
by the intellect is the origin of the higher theologies. 
Thus it seems impossible to imagine but that the founda- 
tions of all knowledge—secular or sacred—were laid when 
intelligence dawned, though the superstructure remained for 
long ages so slight and feeble as to be compatible with the 
existence of almost any general view respecting the mode of 
governance of the universe. No doubt, from the first, there 
were certain phenomena which, to the rudest mind, presented 
a constancy of occurrence, and suggested that a fixed order 
ruled, at any rate, among them. I doubt if the grossest of 
Fetish worshipers ever imagined that a stone must have a 
god within it to make it fall, or that a fruit had a god within 
it to make it taste sweet. With regard to such matters as 
these, it is hardly questionable that mankind from the first 
took strictly positive and scientific views. : 
But, with respect to all the less familiar occurrences which 
present themselves, uncultured man, no doubt, has always 
taken himself as the standard of comparison, as the center 
and measure of the world; nor could he well avoid doing so. 
And finding that his apparently uncaused will has a powerful 
effect in giving rise to many occurrences, he naturally enough 
ascribed other and greater events to other and greater voli- 
tions, and came to look upon the world and all that therein 
is as the product of the volitions of persons like himself, but 
stronger, and capable of being appeased or angered, as he 
himself might be soothed or irritated. Through such concep- 
tions of the plan and working of the universe all mankind have 
passed, or are passing. And we may now consider what has 
been the effect of the improvement of natural knowledge on 
the views of men who have reached this stage, and who have 
begun to cultivate natural knowledge with no desire but that 
of “increasing God’s honor and bettering man’s estate.” 
For example, what could seem wiser, from a mere material 
point of view, more innocent, from a theological one, to an
-P-A-G-E-112
  90 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
ancient people, than that they should learn the exact succes- 
sion of the seasons, as warnings for their husbandmen; or 
the position of the stars, as guides to their rude navigators? 
But what has grown out of this search for natural knowledge 
of so merely useful a character? You all know the reply. 
Astronomy,—which of all sciences has filled men’s minds 
with general ideas of a character most foreign to their daily 
experience, and has, more than any other, rendered it im- 
possible for them to accept the beliefs of their fathers. As- 
tronomy,—which tells them that this so vast and seemingly 
solid earth is but an atom among atoms, whirling, no man 
knows whither, through illimitable space; which demonstrates 
that what we call the peaceful heaven above us, is but that space, 
filled by an infinitely subtle matter whose particles are seething 
and surging, like the waves of an angry sea; which opens up 
to us infinite regions where nothing is known, or ever seems 
to have been known, but matter and force, operating accord- 
ing to rigid rules; which leads us to contemplate phenomena 
the very nature of which demonstrates that they must have had 
a beginning, and that they must have an end, but the very 
nature of which also proves that the beginning was, to our 
conceptions of time, infinitely remote, and that the end is as 
immeasurably distant. 
But it is not alone those who pursue astronomy who ask 
for bread and receive ideas. What more harmless than the 
attempt to lift and distribute water by pumping it; what 
more absolutely and grossly utilitarian? Yet out of pumps 
grow the discussions about Nature’s abhorrence of a vac- 
uum; and then it was discovered that Nature does not abhor 
a vacuum, but that air has weight; and that notion paved 
the way for the doctrine that all matter has weight, and that 
the force which produces weight is co-extensive with the uni- 
verse,—in short, to the theory of universal gravitation and 
endless force. While learning how to handle gases led to the 
discovery of oxygen, and to modern chemistry, and to the 
notion of the indestructibility cf matter. 
Again, what simpler,’ or more absolutely practical, than
-P-A-G-E-113
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM or 
the attempt to keep the axle of a wheel from heating when 
the wheel turns around very fast? How useful for carters 
and gig drivers to know something about this; and how good 
were it, if any ingenious person would find out the cause of 
such phenomena, and thence educe a general remedy for them. 
Such an ingenious person was Count Rumford; and he and his 
successors have landed us in the theory of the persistence, or 
indestructibility, of force. And in the infinitely minute, as in 
the infinitely great, the seekers after natural knowledge of 
the kinds called physical and chemical, have everywhere found 
a definite order and succession of events which seem never 
to be infringed. 
And how has it fared with “Physick” and Anatomy? Have 
the anatomist, the physiologist, or the physician, whose busi- 
ness it has been to devote themselves assiduously to that 
eminently practical and direct end, the alleviation of the 
sufferings of mankind,—have they been able to confine their 
vision more absolutely to the strictly useful? I fear they are 
the worst offenders of all. For if the astronomer has set before 
us the infinite magnitude of space, and the practical eternity 
of the duration of the universe; if the physical and chemical 
philosophers have demonstrated the infinite minuteness of its 
constituent parts, and the practical eternity of matter and of 
force; and if both have alike proclaimed the universality of a 
definite and predicable order and succession of events, the 
workers in biology have not only accepted all these, but have 
added more startling theses of their own. For, as the as- 
tronomers discover in the earth no center of the universe, but an 
eccentric speck, so the naturalists find man to be no center of the 
living world, but one amidst endless modifications of life; and 
as the astronomer observes the mark of practically endless 
time set upon the arrangements of the solar system, so the 
student of life finds the records of ancient forms of existence 
peopling the world for ages, which, in relation to human ex- - 
perience, are infinite. 
Furthermore, the physiologist finds life to be as dependent 
for its manifestation on particular molecular arrangements 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  92 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
as any physical or chemical phenomenon; and wherever he 
extends his researches, fixed order and unchanging causation 
reveal themselves, as plainly as in the rest of Nature. 
Nor can I find that any other fate has awaited the germ 
of Religion. Arising, like all other kinds of knowledge, out 
of the action and interaction of man’s mind, with that which 
is not man’s mind, it has taken the intellectual coverings of 
Fetishism or Polytheism; of Theism or Atheism; of Super- 
stition or Rationalism. With these, and their relative merits 
and demerits, I have nothing to do; but this it is needful for 
my purpose to say, that if the religion of the present differs 
from that of the past, it is because the theology of the present 
has become more scientific than that of the past; because it 
has not only renounced idols of wood and idols of stone, but 
begins to see the necessity of breaking in pieces the idols built 
up of books and traditions and fine-spun ecclesiastical cob- 
webs; and of cherishing the noblest and most human of man’s 
emotions, by worship “for the most part of the silent sort” 
at the altar of the Unknown. 
Such are a few of the new conceptions implanted in our 
minds by the improvement of natural knowledge. Men have 
acquired the ideas of the practically infinite extent of the 
universe and of its practical eternity; they are familiar with 
the conception that our earth is but an infinitesimal frag- 
ment of that part of the universe which can be seen; and that, 
nevertheless, its duration is, as compared with our standards 
of-time, infinite. They have further acquired the idea that 
man is but one of innumerable forms of life now existing on 
the globe, and that the present existences are but the last of 
an immeasurable series of predecessors. Moreover, every step 
they have made in natural knowledge has tended to extend 
and rivet in their minds the conception of a definite order of 
the universe—which is embodied in what are called, by an 
unhappy metaphor, the laws of Nature—and to narrow the 
range and loosen the force of men’s belief in spontaneity, or in 
changes other than such as arise out of that definite order 
itself.
-P-A-G-E-115
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 93 
Whether these ideas are well or ill founded is not the ques- 
tion. No one can deny that they exist, and have been the 
inevitable outgrowth of the improvement of natural knowledge. 
And if so, it cannot be doubted that they are changing the 
form of men’s most cherished and most important convictions. 
And as regards the second point—the extent to which the 
improvement of natural knowledge has remodeled and altered 
what may be termed the intellectual ethics of men,—what 
are among the moral convictions most fondly held by barbarous 
and semi-barbarous people. 
They are the convictions that authority is the soundest 
basis of belief; that merit attaches to a readiness to believe; 
that the doubting disposition is a bad one, and skepticism 
a sin; that when good authority has pronounced what is to 
be believed, and faith has accepted it, reason has no further 
duty. There are many excellent persons who yet hold by 
these principles, and it is not my present business, or inten- 
tion, to discuss their views. All I wish to bring clearly before 
your minds is the unquestionable fact that the improvement 
of natural knowledge is effected by methods which directly 
give the lie to all these convictions, and assume the exact 
reverse of each to be true. 
The improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to 
acknowledge authority, as such. For him, skepticism is the 
highest of duties; blind faith the one unpardonable sin. And 
it cannot be otherwise, for every great advance in natural 
knowledge has involved the absolute rejection of authority, the 
cherishing of the keenest skepticism, the annihilation of the 
spirit of blind faith; and the most ardent votary of science 
holds his firmest convictions, not because the men he most 
venerates hold them; not because their verity is testified by 
portents and wonders, but because his experience teaches him 
that whenever he chooses to bring these convictions into 
contact with their primary source, Nature—whenever he 
thinks fit to test them by appealing to experiment and to 
observation—Nature will confirm them. The man of science has 
learned to believe in justification, not by faith, but by verification.
-P-A-G-E-116
  94 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
Thus, without for a moment pretending to despise the 
practical results of the improvement of natural knowledge, 
and its beneficial influence on material civilization, it must, 
I think, be admitted that the great ideas, some of which I 
have indicated, and the ethical spirit which I have endeay- 
ored to sketch, in the few moments which remained at my 
disposal, constitute the real and permanent significance of 
natural knowledge. 
If these ideas be destined, as I believe they are, to be more 
and more firmly established as the world grows older; if that 
spirit be fated, as I believe it is, to extend itself into all de- 
partments of human thought, and to become co-extensive with 
the range of knowledge; if, as our race approaches its maturity, 
it discovers, as I believe it will, that there is but one kind of 
knowledge and but one method of acquiring it; then we, who 
are still children, may justly feel it our highest duty to recog- 
nize the advisableness of improving natural knowledge, and 
so to aid ourselves and our successors in our course towards 
the noble goal which lies before mankind.

LITERATURE AND SCIENCE! 
MattrHEW ARNOLD 
[Matthew Arnold (1822-1888) is well known as an English poet of the 
Victorian period, but more particularly as a critic of literature and society. 
The following essay shows him as a great apostle of literary culture and 
champion of classical education in a scientific and materialistic age. Liter- 
ature and Science was originally an address delivered several times during a 
visit to the United States in 1883-1884.] : 
Practical people talk with a smile of Plato and of his abso- 
lute ideas; and it is impossible to deny that Plato’s ideas do 
often seem unpractical and impracticable, and especially when 
one views them in connection with the life of a great work-a- 
day world like the United States. The necessary staple of the 
life of such a world Plato regards with disdain; handicraft and 
trade and the working professions he regards with disdain; 
but what becomes of the life of an industrial modern com- 
munity if you take handicraft and trade and the working 
professions out of it? The base mechanic arts and handi- 
crafts, says Plato, bring about a natural weakness in the prin- 
ciple of excellence in a man, so that he cannot govern the 
ignoble growths in him, but nurses them, and cannot under- 
stand fostering any other. Those who exercise such arts and 
trades, as they have their bodies, he says, marred by their 
vulgar businesses, so they have their souls, too, bowed and 
broken by them. And if one of these uncomely people has a 
mind to seek self-culture and philosophy, Plato compares him to 
a bald little tinker, who has scraped together money, and 
has got his release from service, and has had a bath, and bought 
a new coat, and is rigged out like a bridegroom about to marry 
the daughter of his master who has fallen into poor and helpless 
estate. 
Nor do the working professions fare any better than trade 
at the hands of Plato. He draws for us an inimitable picture 
of the working lawyer, and of his life of bondage; he shows 
1 Reprinted from Discourses in America, The Macmillan Company. 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  96 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
how this bondage from his youth up has stunted and warped 
him, and made him small and crooked of soul, encompassing 
him with difficulties which he is not man enough to rely on 
justice and truth as means to encounter, but has recourse, 
for help out of them, to falsehood and wrong. And so, says 
Plato, this poor creature is bent and broken, and grows up 
from boy to man without a particle of soundness in him, al- 
though exceedingly smart and clever in his own esteem. 
One cannot refuse to admire the artist who draws these 
pictures. But we say to ourselves that his ideas show the 
influence of a primitive and obsolete order of things, when 
the warrior caste and the priestly caste were alone in honor, 
and the humble work’ of the world was done by slaves. We 
have now changed all that; the modern majority consists in 
work, as Emerson declares; and in work, we may add, prin- 
cipally of such plain and dusty kind as the work of cultivators 
of the ground, handicraftsmen, men of trade and business, men 
of the working professions. Above allis this true in a 
great industrious community such as that of the United 
States. 
Now education, many people go on to say, is still mainly 
governed by the ideas of men like Plato, who lived when the 
warrior caste and the priestly or philosophical class were alone in 
honor, and the really useful part of the community were slaves. 
It is an education fitted for persons of leisure in such a com- 
munity. This education passed from Greece and Rome to the 
feudal communities of Europe, where also the warrior caste 
and the priestly caste were alone held in honor, and where the 
really useful and working part of the community, though not 
nominally slaves as in the pagan world, were practically not 
much better off than slaves, and not more seriously regarded. 
And how absurd it is, people end by saying, to inflict this edu- 
cation upon an industrious modern community, where very 
few indeed are persons of leisure, and the mass to be consid- 
ered has not leisure, but is bound, for its own great good, and 
for the great good of the world at large, to plain labor and 
to industrial pursuits, and the education in question tends 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 97 
necessarily to make men dissatisfied with these pursuits and 
unfitted for them! 
That is what is said. So far I must defend Plato, as to 
plead that his view of education and studies is in the general, 
as it seems to me, sound enough, and fitted for all sorts and 
conditions of men, whatever their pursuits may be. “An 
intelligent man,” says Plato, “will prize those studies which 
result in his soul getting soberness, righteousness, and wisdom, 
and will less value the others.” I cannot consider that a bad 
description of the aim of education, and of the motives which 
should govern us in the choice of studies, whether we are pre- 
paring ourselves for a hereditary seat in the English House of 
Lords or for the pork trade in Chicago. 
Still I admit that Plato’s world was.not ours, that his scorn of 
trade and handicraft is fantastic, that he had no conception of 
a great industrial community such as that of the United States, 
and that such a community must and will shape its education 
to suit its own needs. If the usual education handed down to 
it from the past does not suit it, it will certainly before long drop 
this and try another. The usual education in the past has 
been mainly literary. The question is whether the studies 
which were long supposed to be the best for all of us are prac- 
tically the best now; whether others are not better. The tyran- 
ny of the past, many think, weighs on us injuriously in the pre- 
dominance given to letters in education. The question is 
raised whether, to meet the needs of our modern life, the pre- 
dominance ought not now to pass from letters to science; and 
naturally the question is nowhere raised with more energy than 
here in the United States. The design of abasing what is called 
“mere literary instruction and education,” and of exalting what 
is called “sound, extensive, and practical scientific knowledge,” 
is, in this intensely modern world of the United States, even 
more perhaps than in Europe, a very popular design, and makes 
great and rapid progress. 
I am going to ask whether the present movement for ousting 
letters from their old predominance in education, and for trans- 
ferring the predominance in education to the natural sciences,
-P-A-G-E-120
98 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
whether this brisk and flourishing movement ought to prevail, 
and whether it is likely that in the end it really will prevail. An 
objection may be raised which I will anticipate. My own stud- 
ies have been almost wholly in letters, and my visits to the field 
of the natural sciences have been very slight and inadequate, 
although those sciences have always strongly moved my curi- 
osity. A man of letters, it will perhaps be said, is not competent 
to discuss the comparative merits of letters and natural science 
as means of education. To this objection I reply, first of all, 
that his incompetence, if he attempts the discussion but is 
really incompetent for it, will be abundantly visible; nobody will 
be taken in; he will have plenty of sharp observers and critics 
to save mankind from that danger. But the line I am going to 
follow is, as you will soon discover, so extremely simple, that 
perhaps it may be followed without failure even by one who for 
amore ambitious line of discussion would be quite incompe- 
tent. 
Some of you may possibly remember a phrase of mine which 
has been the object of a good deal of comment; an observation 
to the effect that in our culture, the aim being to know ourselves 
and the world, we have, as the means to this end, to know the 
best which has been thought and said in the world» A man of 
science, who is also an excellent writer and the very prince of 
debaters, Professor Huxley, in a discourse at the opening of 
Sir Josiah Mason’s college at Birmingham, laying hold of this 
phrase, expanded it by quoting some more words of mine, which 
are these: ‘The civilized world is to be regarded as now being, 
for intellectual and spiritual purposes, one great confederation, 
bound to a joint action and working to a common result; and 
whose members have for their proper outfit a knowledge of 
Greek, Roman, and Eastern antiquity, and of one another. 
Special local and temporary advantages being put out of account 
that modern nation will in the intellectual and spiritual sphere 
make most progress, which most thoroughly carries out this 
programme.”

Now on my phrase, thus enlarged, Professor Huxley remarks 
that when I speak of the above-mentioned knowledge as ena- 
bling us to know ourselves and the world, I assert literature to 
contain the materials which suffice for thus making us know 
ourselves and the world. But it is not by any means clear, says 
he, that after having learnt all which ancient and modern litera- 
tures have to tell us, we have laid a sufficiently broad and deep 
foundation for that criticism of life, that knowledge of ourselves 
and the world, which constitutes culture. On the contrary, 
Professor Huxley declares that he finds himself “wholly unable 
to admit that either nations or individuals will really advance, if 
their outfit draws nothing from the stores of physical science. 
An army without weapons of precision, and with no particular 
base of operations, might more hopefully enter upon a campaign 
on the Rhine, than a man, devoid of a knowledge of what physi- 
cal science has done in the last century, upon a criticism of life.” 
This shows how needful it is for those who are to discuss any 
matter together to have a common understanding as to the 
sense of the terms they employ,—how needful, and how difficult. 
What Professor Huxley says implies just the reproach which is 
so often brought against the study of belles lettres, as they are 
called: that the study is an elegant one, but slight and ineffec- 
tual; a smattering of Greek and Latin and other ornamenta} 
things, of little use for anyone whose object is to get at truth, 
and to be a practical man. So, too, M. Renan talks of the 
“superficial humanism” of a school-course which treats us as 
if we were all going to be poets, writers, preachers, orators, and 
he opposes this humanism to positive science, or the critical 
search after truth. And there is always a tendency in those 
who are remonstrating against the predominance of letters in 
education, to understand by letters belles lettres, and by belles 
lettres a superficial humanism, the opposite of science or true 
knowledge. 
But when we talk of knowing Greek and Roman antiquity, 
for instance, which is the knowledge people have called the 
humanities, I for my part mean a knowledge which is something 
more than a superficial humanism, mainly decorative. ‘TI call 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  too COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
all teaching scientific,” says Wolf, the critic of Homer, “which 
is systematically laid out and followed up to its original sources. 
For example: a knowledge of classical antiquity is scientific 
when the remains of classical antiquity are correctly studied 
in the original languages.”” There can be no doubt that Wolf 
is perfectly right; that all learning is scientific which is sys- 
tematically laid out and followed up to its original sources, 
and that a genuine humanism is scientific. 
When I speak of knowing Greek and Roman antiquity, there- 
fore, as a help to knowing ourselves and the world, I mean more 
than a knowledge of so much vocabulary, so much grammar, 
so many portions of authors in the Greek and Latin languages, I 
mean knowing the Greeks and Romans, and their life and 
genius, and what they were and did in the world; what we get 
from them, and what is its value. That, at least, is the ideal; 
and when we talk of endeavoring to know Greek and Roman 
antiquity, as a help to knowing ourselves and the world, we 
mean endeavoring so to know them as to satisfy this ideal, how- 
ever much we may still fall short of it. 
The same also as to knowing our own and other modern 
nations, with the like aim of getting to understand ourselves and 
the world. To know the best that has been thought and said 
by the modern nations is to know, says Professor Huxley, “only 
what modern /iteratures have to tell us; it is the criticism of life 
contained in modern literature.” And yet “the distinctive 
character of our times,” he urges, “lies in the vast and constantly 
increasing part which is ‘played by natural knowledge.” And 
how, therefore, can a man, devoid of knowledge of what physical 
science has done in the last century, enter hopefully upon a 
criticism of modern life? 
Let us, I say, be agreed about the meaning of the terms we 
are using. I talk of knowing the best which has been thought 
and uttered in the world; Professor Huxley says this means 
knowing Jiterature. Literature is a large word; it may mean 
everything written with letters or printed in a book. Euclid’s 
Elements and Newton’s Principia are thus literature. All knowl- 
edge that reaches us through books is literature. But by litera-
-P-A-G-E-123
  
THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM Iol 
ture Professor Huxley means belles lettres. He means to make 
me say that knowing the best which has been thought and said 
by the modern nations is knowing their belles lettres and no 
more. And this is no sufficient equipment, he argues, for a 
criticism of modern life. But as I do not mean, by knowing 
ancient Rome, knowing merely more or less of Latin belles lettres, 
and taking no account of Rome’s military, and political, and 
legal, and administrative work in the world; and as, by knowing 
ancient Greece, I understand knowing her as the giver of Greek 
art, and the guide to a free and right use of reason and to scien- 
tific method, and the founder of our mathematics and physics 
and astronomy and biology,—I understand knowing her as all 
this, and not merely knowing certain Greek poems, and his- 
tories, and treatises, and speeches,—so as to the knowledge of 
modern nations also. By knowing modern nations, I mean not 
merely knowing their belles lettres, but knowing also what has 
been done by such men as Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Dar- 
win. “Our ancestors learned,” says Professor Huxley, “that 
the earth is the center of the visible universe, and that man is 
the cynosure of things terrestrial; and more especially was it 
inculcated that the course of nature had no fixed order, but that 
it could be, and constantly was, altered.” But for us now, con- 
tinues Professor Huxley, “the notions of the beginning and the 
end of the world entertained by our forefathers are no longer 
credible. It is very certain that the earth is not the chief body 
in the material universe, and that the world is not subordinated 
to man’s use. It is even more certain that nature is the expres- 
sion of a definite order, with which nothing interferes.” “And 
yet,” he cries, “the purely classical education advocated by 
the representatives of the humanists in our day gives no inkling 
of all this!” 
In due place and time I will just touch upon that vexed ques- 
tion of classical education; but at present the question is as to 
what is meant by knowing the best which modern nations have 
thought and said. It is not knowing their belles lettres merely 
which is meant. To know Italian belles lettres is not to know 
Italy, and to know English belles lettres is not to know England.
-P-A-G-E-124
1oz COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
Into knowing Italy and England there comes a great deal more, 
Galileo and Newton among it. The reproach of being a 
superficial humanism, a tincture of belles lettres, may attach 
rightly enough to some other disciplines; but to the particular 
discipline recommended when I proposed knowing the best that 
has been thought and said in the world, it does not apply. In 
that best I certainly include what in modern times has been 
thought and said by the great observers and knowers of nature. 
There is, therefore, really no question between Professor 
Huxley and me as to whether knowing the great results of the 
modern scientific study of nature is not required as a part of our 
culture, as well as knowing the products of literature and art. 
But to follow the processes by which those results are reached, 
ought, say the friends of physical science, to be made the staple 
of education for the bulk of mankind. And here there does arise 
a question between those whom Professor Huxley calls with 
playful sarcasm “the Levites of culture,” and those whom the 
poor humanist is sometimes apt to regard as its Nebuchadnez- 
zars. 
The great results of the scientific investigation of nature we 
are agreed upon knowing, but how much of our study are we 
bound to give to the processes by which those results are reached? 
The results have their visible bearing on human life. But all the 
processes, too, all the items of fact, by which those results 
are reached and established, are interesting. All knowledge is 
interesting to a wise man, and the knowledge of nature is interest- 
ing to all men. It is very interesting to know that, from the 
albuminous white of the egg, the chick in the egg gets the ma- 
terials for its flesh, bones, blood, and feathers; while, from the 
fatty yolk of the egg, it gets the heat and energy which enable 
it at length to break its shell and begin the world. It is less 
interesting, perhaps, but still it is interesting, to know that when 
a taper burns, the wax is converted into carbonic acid and water. 
Moreover, it is quite true that the habit of dealing with facts, 
which is given by the study of nature, is, as the friends of physi- 
cal science praise it for being, an excellent discipline. The 
appeal, in the study of nature, is constantly to observation and
-P-A-G-E-125
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 10g 
experiment; not only is it said that the thing is so, but we can 
be made to see that it is so. Not only does a man tell us that 
when a taper burns the wax is converted into carbonic acid and 
water, as a man may tell us, if he likes, that Charon is punting 
his ferry-boat on the river Styx, or that Victor Hugo is a sublime 
poet, or Mr. Gladstone the most admirable of statesmen; but 
we are made to see that the conversion into carbonic acid and 
water does actually happen. This reality of natural knowledge 
it is, which makes the friends of physical science contrast it, as 
a knowledge of things, with the humanist’s knowledge, which is, 
say they, a knowledge of words. And hence Professor Huxley 
is moved to lay it down that, “for the purpose of attaining real 
culture, an exclusively scientific education is at least as effectual 
as an exclusively literary education.” And a certain President 
of the Section for Mechanical Science in the British Association 
is, in Scripture phrase, “very bold,” and declares that if a man, 
in his mental training, “has substituted literature and history 
for natural science, he has chosen the less useful alternative.” 
But whether we go these lengths or not, we must all admit that 
in natural science the habit gained of dealing with facts is a most 
valuable discipline, and that every one should have some ex- 
perience of it. 
More than this, however, is demanded by the reformers. It 
is proposed to make the training in natural science the main 
part of education, for the great majority of mankind at any rate. 
And here, I confess, I part company with the friends of physical 
science, with whom up to this point I have been agreeing. In 
differing from them, however, I wish to proceed with the utmost 
caution and diffidence. The smallness of my own acquaintance 
with the disciplines of natural science is ever before my mind, 
and I am fearful of doing these disciplines an injustice. The 
ability and pugnacity of the partisans of natural science make 
them formidable persons to contradict. The tone of tentative 
inquiry, which befits a being of dim faculties and bounded knowl- 
edge, is the tone I would wish to take and not to depart from. 
At present it seems to me, that those who are for giving to nat- 
ural knowledge, as they call it, the chief place in the education 
   
-P-A-G-E-126
  1o4. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
of the majority of mankind, leave one important thing out of 
their account: the constitution of human nature. But I put 
this forward on the strength of some facts not at all recondite, . 
very far from it; facts capable of being stated in the simplest 
possible fashion, and to which, if I so state them, the man of 
science will, I am sure, be willing to allow their due weight. 
Deny the facts altogether, I think, he hardly can. He can 
hardly deny, that when we set ourselves to enumerate the powers 
which go to the building up of human life, and say that they are 
the power of conduct, the power of intellect and knowledge, the 
power of beauty, and the power of social life and manners,— 
he can hardly deny that this scheme, though drawn in rough 
and plain lines enough, and not pretending to scientific exactness, 
does yet give a fairly true representation of the matter. Human 
nature is built up by these powers; we have the need for them all. 
When we have rightly met and adjusted the claims of them all, 
we shall then be in a fair way for getting soberness and righteous- 
ness, with wisdom. This is evident enough, and the friends of 
physical science would admit it. 
But perhaps they may not have sufficiently observed an- 
other thing: namely, that the several powers just mentioned 
are not isolated, but there is, in the generality of mankind, a 
perpetual tendency to relate them one to another in divers ways. 
With one such way of relating them I am particularly con- 
cerned now. Following our instinct for intellect and knowl- 
edge, we acquire pieces of knowledge; and presently, in the 
generality of men, there arises the desire to relate these pieces 
of knowledge to our sense for conduct, to our sense for beauty,— 
and there is weariness and dissatisfaction if the desire is balked. 
Now in this desire lies, I think, the strength of that hold which 
letters have upon us. 
All knowledge is, as I said just now, interesting; and even 
items of knowledge which from the nature of the case cannot 
well be related, but must stand isolated in our thoughts, have 
their interest. Even lists of exceptions have their interest. 
If we are studying Greek accents, it is interesting to know that 
pais and pas, and some other monosyllables of the same form
-P-A-G-E-127
  
THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 105 
of declension, do not take the circumflex upon the last syllable 
of the genitive plural, but vary, in this respect, from the com- 
mon rule. If we are studying physiology, it is interesting to 
know that the pulmonary artery carries dark blood and the 
pulmonary vein carries bright blood, departing in this respect 
from the common rule for the division of labor between the 
veins and the arteries. But every one knows how we seek 
naturally to combine the pieces of our knowledge together, 
to bring them under general rules, to relate them to principles; 
and how unsatisfactory and tiresome it would be to go on for- 
ever learning lists of exceptions, or accumulating items of fact 
which must stand isolated. 
Well, that same need of relating our knowledge, which 
operates here within the sphere of our knowledge itself, we shall 
find operating, also, outside that sphere. We experience, as 
we go on learning and knowing,—the vast majority of us ex- 
perience,—the need of relating what we have learned and known 
to the sense which we have in us for conduct, to the sense 
which we have in us for beauty. 
A certain Greek prophetess of Mantineia in Arcadia, Diotima 
by name, once explained to the philosopher Socrates that 
love, and impulse, and bent of all kinds, is, in fact, nothing 
else but the desire in men that good should forever be present 
to them. This desire for good, Diotima assured Socrates, is 
our fundamental desire, of which fundamental desire every 
impulse in us is only some one particular form. And therefore 
this fundamental desire it is, 1 suppose,—this desire in men 
that good should be forever present to them,—which acts 
in us when we feel the impulse for relating our knowledge 
to our sense for conduct and to our sense for beauty. At any 
rate, with men in general the instinct exists. Such is human 
nature. And the instinct, it will be admitted, is innocent, 
and human nature is preserved by our following the lead of 
its innocent instincts. Therefore, in seeking to gratify this 
instinct in question, we are following the instinct of self- 
preservation in humanity. 
But, no doubt, some kinds of knowledge cannot be made 
®
-P-A-G-E-128
  106 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
to directly serve the instinct in question, cannot be directly 
related to the sense for beauty, to the sense for conduct. These 
are instrument-knowledges; they lead on to other knowledges, 
which can. A man who passes his life in instrument-knowledges 
is a specialist. They may be invaluable as instruments to some- 
thing beyond, for those who have the gift thus to employ them; 
and they may be disciplines in themselves wherein it is useful 
for every one to have some schooling. But it is inconceivable 
that the generality of men should pass all their mental life 
with Greek accents or with formal logic. My friend Professor 
Sylvester, who is one of the first mathematicians in the world, 
holds transcendental doctrines as to the virtue of mathematics, 
but those doctrines are not for common men. In the very 
Senate House and heart of our English Cambridge I once 
ventured, though not without an apology for my profaneness, 
to hazard the opinion that for the majority of mankind a little 
of mathematics, even, goes a long way. Of course this is 
quite consistent with their being of immense importance as 
an instrument to something else; but it is the few who 
have the aptitude for thus using them, not the bulk of 
mankind. 
The natural sciences do not, however, stand on the same 
footing with these instrument-knowledges. Experience shows 
us that the generality of men will find more interest in learning 
that, when a taper burns, the wax is converted into carbonic 
acid and water, or in learning the explanation of the phenom- 
enon of dew, or in learning how the circulation of the blood 
is carried on, than they find in learning that the genitive plural 
of pais and pas does not take the circumflex on the termina- 
tion. And one piece of natural knowledge is added to an- 
other, and others are added to that, and at last we come to 
propositions so interesting as Mr. Darwin’s famous proposition 
that “our ancestor was a hairy quadruped furnished with a tail 
and pointed ears, probably arboreal in his habits.”” Or we come 
to propositions of such reach and magnitude as those which 
Professor Huxley delivers, when he says that the notions of 
our forefathers about the beginning and the end of the world 
*
-P-A-G-E-129
THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 107 
were all wrong, and that nature is the expression of a definite 
order with which nothing interferes. 
Interesting, indeed, these results of science are, important 
they are, and we should all of us be acquainted with them. 
But what I now wish you to mark is, that we are still, when 
they are propounded to us and we receive them, we are still 
in the sphere of intellect and knowledge. And for the gen- 
erality of men there will be found, I say, to arise, when they 
have duly taken in the proposition that their ancestor was 
“a hairy quadruped furnished with a tail and pointed ears, 
probably arboreal in his habits,” there will be found to arise 
an invincible desire to relate this proposition to the sense in 
us for conduct, and to the sense in us for beauty. But this the 
men of science will not do for us, and will hardly even profess 
to do. They will give us other pieces of knowledge, other 
facts, about other animals and their ancestors, or about plants, 
or about stones, or about stars; and they may finally bring us 
to those great “general conceptions of the universe, which 
are forced upon us all,” says Professor Huxley, ‘“‘by the progress 
of physical science.” But still it will be knowledge only which 
they give us; knowledge not put for us into relation with our 
sense for conduct, our sense for beauty, and touched with 
emotion by being so put; not thus put for us, and therefore, 
to the majority of mankind, after a certain while, unsatis- 
fying, wearying. 
Not to the born naturalist, ladmit. But what do we mean by 
a born naturalist? We mean a man in whom the zeal for ob- 
serving nature is so uncommonly strong and eminent, that it 
marks him off from the bulk of mankind. Such a man will pass 
his life happily in collecting natural knowledge and reasoning 
upon it, and will ask for nothing, or hardly anything, more. I 
have heard it said that the sagacious and admirable naturalist 
whom we lost not very long ago, Mr. Darwin, once owned to a 
friend that for his part he did not experience the necessity for 
two things which most men find so necessary to them,—religion 
and poetry; science and the domestic affections, he thought, 
were enough. To a born naturalist, I can well understand that
-P-A-G-E-130
108 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
this should seem so. So absorbing is his occupation with nature, 
so strong his love for his occupation, that he goes on acquiring 
natural knowledge and reasoning upon it, and has little time or 
inclination for thinking about getting it related to the desire 
in man for conduct, the desire in man for beauty. He relates 
it to them for himself as he goes along, so far as he feels the need; 
and he draws from the domestic affections all the additional 
solace necessary. But then Darwins are extremely rare. An- 
other great and admirable master of natural knowledge, Faraday, 
was a Sandemanian. That is to say, he related his knowledge 
to his instinct for conduct and to his instinct for beauty, by the 
aid of that respectable Scottish sectary, Robert Sandeman. And 
so strong, in general, is the demand of religion and poetry to 
have their share in a man, to associate themselves with his 
knowing, and to relieve and rejoice it, that, probably, for one 
man among us with the disposition to do as Darwin did in 
this respect, there are at least fifty with the disposition to do 
as Faraday. 
Education lays hold upon us, in fact, by satisfying this de- 
mand. Professor Huxley holds up to scorn medieval education, 
with its neglect of the knowledge of nature, its poverty even of 
literary studies, its formal logic devoted to “showing how and 
why that which the Church said was true must be true.” But 
the great medieval universities were not brought into being, 
we may be sure, by the zeal for giving a jejune and contemptible 
education. Kings have been their nursing fathers, and queens 
have been their nursing mothers, but not for this. The medieval 
universities came into being, because the supposed knowledge, 
delivered by Scripture and the Church, so deeply engaged men’s 
hearts, by so simply, easily, and powerfully relating itself to 
their desire for conduct, their desire for beauty. All other 
knowledge was dominated by this supposed knowledge and was 
subordinated to it, because of the surpassing strength of the 
hold which it gained upon the affections of men, by allying itself 
profoundly with their sense for conduct, their sense for| 
beauty. 
But now, says Professor Huxley, conceptions of the univers        
          
     
                           
-P-A-G-E-131
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 109 
fatal to the notions held by our forefathers have been forced 
upon us by physical science. Grant to him that they are thus 
fatal, that the new conceptions must and will soon become cur- 
rent everywhere, and that every one will finally perceive them 
to be fatal to the beliefs of our forefathers. The need of humane 
letters, as they are truly called, because they serve the para- 
mount desire in men that good should be forever present to 
them,—the need of humane letters, to establish a relation be- 
tween the new conceptions, and our instinct for beauty, our 
instinct for conduct, is only the more visible. The Middle Age 
could do without humane letters, as it could do without the 
study of nature, because its supposed knowledge was made to 
engage its emotions so powerfully. Grant that the supposed 
knowledge disappears, its power of being made to engage the 
emotions will of course disappear along with it,—but the emo- 
tions themselves, and their claim to be engaged and satisfied, 
will remain. Now if we find by experience that humane letters 
have an undeniable power of engaging the emotions, the im- 
portance of humane letters in a man’s training becomes not less, 
- but greater, in proportion to the success of modern science in 
extirpating what it calls “medieval thinking.” 
Have humane letters, then, have poetry and eloquence, the 
power here attributed to them of engaging the emotions, and 
do they exercise it? And if they have it and exercise it, how do 
they exercise it, so as to exert an influence upon man’s sense for 
conduct, his sense for beauty? Finally, even if they both can 
and do exert an influence upon the senses in question, how are 
they to relate to them the results,—the modern results,—of 
natural science? All these questions may be asked. First, 
have poetry and eloquence the power of calling out the emotions? 
The appeal is to experience. Experience shows that for the 
vast majority of men, for mankind in general, they have the 
power. Next, do they exercise it? They do, But then, how 
do they exercise it so as to affect man’s sense for conduct, his 
sense for beauty? And this is perhaps a case for applying the 
Preacher’s words: ‘Though a man labor to seek it out, yet 
he shall not find it; yea, farther, though a wise man think to 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  
110 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.””*_ Why should it be 
one thing, in its effect upon the emotions, to say, “Patience is a 
virtue,” and quite another thing, in its effect upon the emotions, 
to say with Homer, 
tAyTOV yap Moipar Ovpdv Oecay dvOpdrocw—2 
“for an enduring heart have the destinies appointed to the 
children of men”? Why should it be one thing, in its 
effect upon the emotions, to say with the philosopher Spin- 
oza, Felicitas in eo consistit quo homo suum esse conservare 
potest—Man’s happiness consists in his being able to preserve 
his own essence,” and quite another thing, in its effect upon the 
emotions, to say with the Gospel, “What is a man advantaged, 
if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, forfeit himself?” 
How does this difference of effect arise? I cannot tell, and I 
am not much concerned to know; the important thing is that 
it does arise, and that we can profit by it. But how, finally, 
are poetry and eloquence to exercise the power of relating the 
modern results of natural science to man’s instinct for conduct, 
his instinct for beauty? And here again I answer that I do not 
know how they will exercise it, but that they can and will exer- 
cise it I am sure. I do not mean that modern philosophical 
poets and modern philosophical moralists are to come and relate 
for us, in express terms, the results of modern scientific research 
to our instinct for conduct, our instinct for beauty. But I 
mean that we shall find, as a matter of experience, if we know 
the best that has been thought and uttered in the world, we 
shall find that the art and poetry and eloquence of men who lived, 
perhaps, long ago, who had the most limited natural knowledge, 
who had the most erroneous conceptions about many important 
matters, we shall find that this art, and poetry, and eloquence, 
have in fact not, only the power of refreshing and delighting us, 
they have also the power —such is the strength and worth, in 
essentials, of their authors’ criticism of life-—they have a forti- 
fying, and elevating, and quickening, and suggestive power, 
capable of wonderfully helping us to relate the results of modern

science to our need for conduct, our need for beauty. Homer’s 
conceptions of the physical universe were, I imagine, grotesque; 
but really, under the shock of hearing from modern science that 
“the world is not subordinated to man’s use, and that man is 
not the cynosure of things terrestrial,” I could, for my own part, 
desire no better comfort than Homer’s line which I quoted just 
now, 
tAntov yap Moipos Grpov Oécav avOpdrocw— 
“for an enduring heart have the destinies appointed to the chil- 
dren of men”! 
And the more that men’s minds are cleared, the more that 
the results of science are frankly accepted, the more that 
poetry and eloquence come to be received and studied as 
what in truth they really are,—the criticism of life by gifted 
men, alive and active with extraordinary power at an unusual 
number of points;—so much the more will the value of humane 
letters, and of art also, which is an utterance having a like 
kind of power with theirs, be felt and acknowledged, and their 
place in education be secured. 
Let us therefore, all of us, avoid indeed as much as possible 
any invidious comparison between the merits of humane let- 
ters, as means of* education, and the merits of the natural 
sciences. But when some President of a Section for Mechan- 
ical Science insists on making the comparison, and tells us 
that “he who in his training has substituted literature and 
history for natural science has chosen the less useful alterna- 
tive,” let us make answer to him that the student of humane 
letters only, will, at least, know also the great general con- 
ceptions brought in by modern physical science; for science, as 
Professor Huxley says, forces them upon us all. But the 
student of the natural sciences only, will, by our very hy- 
pothesis, know nothing of humane letters; not to mention 
that in setting himself to be perpetually accumulating natural 
knowledge, he sets himself to do what only specialists have 
in general the gift for doing genially. And so he will probably 
be unsatisfied, or at any rate incomplete, and even more in- 
complete than the student of humane letters only.

  112. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
I once mentioned in a school report, how a young man in 
one of our English training colleges having to paraphrase the 
passage in Macbeth beginning, 
Can’st thou not minister to a mind diseased? 
turned this line into, “Can you not wait upon the lunatic?” 
And I remarked what a curious state of things it would be, 
if every pupil of our national schools knew, let us say, that 
the moon is two thousand one hundred and sixty miles in 
diameter, and thought at the same time that a good para- 
phrase for 
Can’st thou not minister to a mind diseased? 
was, “Can you not wait upon the lunatic?” If one is driven 
to choose, I think I would rather have a young person ignorant 
about the moon’s diameter, but aware that “Can you not 
wait upon the lunatic?” is bad, than a young person whose 
education had been such as to manage things the other way. 
Or to go higher than the pupils of our national schools. 
I have in my mind’s eye a member of our British Parliament 
who comes to travel here in America, who afterwards relates 
his travels, and who shows a really masterly knowledge of the 
geology of this great country and of its mining capabilities, 
but who ends by gravely suggesting that the United States 
should borrow a prince from our Royal Family, and should 
make him their king, and should create a House of Lords of 
great landed proprietors after the pattern of ours; and then 
America, he thinks, would have her future happily and per- 
fectly secured. Surely, in this case, the President of the Sec- 
tion for Mechanical Science would himself hardly say that 
our member of Parliament, by concentrating himself upon 
geology and mineralogy, and so on, and not attending to lit- 
erature and history, had “chosen the more useful alternative.” 
If then there is to be separation and option between humane 
letters on the one hand, and the natural sciences on the other, 
the great majority of mankind, all who have not exceptional 
and overpowering aptitudes for the study of nature, would do
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 113 
well, I cannot but think, to choose to be educated in humane 
letters rather than in the natural sciences. Letters will call 
out their being at more points, will make them live more. 
I said that before I ended I would just touch on the question 
of classical education, and I will keep my word. Even if lit- 
erature is to retain a large place in our education, yet Latin 
and Greek, say the friends of progress, will certainly have 
to go. Greek is the grand offender in the eyes of these gentle- 
men, The attackers of the established course of study think 
that against Greek, at any rate, they have irresistible arguments. 
Literature may perhaps be needed in education, they say; but 
why on earth should it be Greek literature? Why not French 
or German? Nay, “has not an Englishman models in his 
own literature of every kind of excellence?” As before, it is 
not on any weak pleadings of my own that I rely for convincing 
the gainsayers; it is on the constitution of human nature itself, 
and on the instinct of self-preservation in humanity. The 
instinct for beauty is set in human nature, as surely as the 
instinct for knowledge is set there, or the instinct for con- 
duct. If the instinct for beauty is served by Greek litera- 
ture and art as it is served by no other literature and art, 
we may trust to the instinct of self-preservation in humanity 
for keeping Greek as part of our culture. We may trust to it 
for even making the study of Greek more prevalent than it 
is now. Greek will come, I hope, some day to be studied more 
rationally than at present; but it will be increasingly studied 
as men increasingly feel the need in them for beauty, and how 
powerfully Greek art and Greek literature can serve this need. 
Women will again study Greek, as Lady Jane Grey did; I 
believe that in that chain of forts, with which the fair host 
of the Amazons are now engirdling our English universities, 
I find that here in America, in colleges like Smith College in 
Massachusetts, and Vassar College in the State of New York, 
and in the happy families of the mixed universities out West, 
they are studying it already. 
Defuit una mihi symmetria prisca,—“<The antique sym- 
metry was the one thing wanting to me,” said Leonardo da 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  114 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
Vinci; and he was an Italian. I will not presume to speak for 
the Americans, but I am sure that, in the Englishman, the want 
of this admirable symmetry of the Greeks is a thousand times 
more great and crying than in any Italian. The results of the 
want show themselves most glaringly, perhaps, in our archi- 
tecture, but they show themselves, also, in all our art. Fit 
details strictly combined, in view of a large general result nobly 
conceived; that is just the beautiful symmetria prisca of the 
Greeks, and it is just where we English fail, where all our 
art fails. Striking ideas we have, and well-executed details 
we have; but that high symmetry which, with satisfying and 
delightful effect, combines them, we seldom or never have. 
The glorious beauty of the Acropolis at Athens did not come 
from single fine things stuck about on that hill, a statue here, 
a gateway there,—no, it arose from all things being perfectly 
combined for a supreme total effect. What must not an Eng- | 
lishman feel about our deficiencies in this respect, as the sense 
for beauty, whereof this symmetry is an essential element, 
awakens and strengthens within him! what will not one day 
be his respect and desire for Greece and its symmetria prisca, 
when the scales drop from his eyes as he walks the London 
streets, and he sees such a lesson in meanness as the Strand, 
for instance, in its true deformity! But here we are coming 
to our friend Mr. Ruskin’s province, and I will not intrude 
upon it, for he is its very sufficient guardian. 
And so we at last find, it seems, we find flowing in favor 
of the humanities the natural and necessary stream of things, 
which seemed against them when we started. The “hairy 
quadruped furnished with a tail and pointed ears, probably 
arboreal in his habits,” this good fellow carried hidden in his 
nature, apparently, something destined to develop into a neces- 
sity for humane letters. Nay, more; we seem finally to be even 
led to the further conclusion that our hairy ancestor carried 
in his nature, also, a necessity for Greek. 
And therefore, to say the truth, I cannot really think that 
humane letters are in much actual danger of being thrust out 
from their leading place in education, in spite of the array of 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM tig 
authorities against them at this moment. So long as human 
nature is what it is, their attractions will remain irresistible. 
As with Greek so with letters generally: they will some day 
come, we may hope, to be studied more rationally, but 
they will not lose their place. What will happen will rather 
be that there will be crowded into education other matters 
besides, far too many; there will be, perhaps, a period 
of unsettlement and confusion and false tendency; but letters 
will not in the end lose their leading place. If they lose it for 
a time, they will get it back again. We shall be brought back 
to them by our wants and aspirations. And a poor humanist 
may possess his soul in patience, neither strive nor cry, admit 
the energy and brilliancy of the partisans of physical science, 
and their present favor with the public, to be far greater than 
his own, and still have a happy faith that the nature of things 
works silently on behalf of the studies which he loves, and 
that, while we shall all have to acquaint ourselves with the 
great results reached by modern science, and to give ourselves 
as much training in its disciplines as we can conveniently 
carry, yet the majority of men will always require humane 
letters; and so much the more, as they have the more and the 
greater results of science to relate to the need in man for con- 
duct, and to the need in him for beauty. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. Explain clearly what Arnold thinks is the value of the study 
of literature. 2. Discuss how far belief in the special efficacy of 
science or of literature in education may be a matter of temperament. 
Possibly Arnold and Huxley might be used as typical cases. 3. Set 
forth Arnold’s definition of culture. See his essay, “Sweetness and 
Light,” in Culture and Anarchy for further elaboration of this rather 
famous definition. 4. How well has Arnold succeeded in uniting 
literature and science by his statement, “all learning is scientific 
which is systematically laid out and followed up to its original sources” 
(page 100)? 5. How far may Arnold’s definition of literature as “all 
knowledge that reaches us through books” be accepted? 6. En- 
deavor to explain in simple fashion what is the meaning of each

of the four powers which Arnold indicates as going into the building 
up of human life. 7. Set forth Arnold’s grounds for his staunch 
belief in the classical literatures. If his position does not appeal 
to you, give your criticism of it. 
: THE FUNCTION OF ART?! 
5 Joun Carrp 
[John Caird (1820-1898) was a distinguished Scotch divine and _philos- 
opher. From 1873 to the close of his life he was vice-chancellor and prin- 
cipal of the University of Glasgow. It was his custom to deliver at the 
opening of each session of the University an address on some subject con- 
nected with the studies of the University, or on the work of some great 
author—philosopher or theologian, scientific or literary man—who might 
be regarded as representative of one of these studies. The selection here 
given is a portion of one of these addresses, entitled The Study of Art.] 
‘It would seem at first sight that an inquiry into the uses 
of art involves a contradiction in terms. What we seek in a 
work of art is not instruction or information, not material or 
other advantages, but simply pleasure or enjoyment. Music, 
painting, poetry, and the other fine arts, whatever they do 
for the embellishment or decoration of human life, obviously 
contribute nothing to the supply of its practical necessities. 
They may form the luxury of idleness or the’ innocent pastime 
of our hours of leisure, but in themselves they have no moral 
purpose or practical utility; and whenever pleasure clashes 
with profit, they may even become noxious—diverting, as they 
do, time and thought from the serious work or sterner tasks 
of life. 
Moreover, the view of the function of art that relecates it to 
the province of the ornamental as distinguished from the use- 
ful, seems to be sanctioned not merely by popular thought, 
but also by philosophic theory. Among those who speculate 
on the subject the accepted theory seems to be that which is 
embodied in the phrase, “Art for art’s sake,” meaning by 
1 Reprinted by permission from University Addresses, James MacLehose and Sons.
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 117 
that, that art is to be prosecuted for itself, and not for any 
ulterior end. The end of a work of art is not to point a moral 
or to convey a lesson in science or philosophy, or even to soften 
the manners and refine the habits of society; but to be, in and 
for itself, a source of delight. It appeals to what has been 
called the “play impulse” in human nature, to the spontaneous 
enjoyment of activities which men put forth, not for the wages 
they are to earn or the benefits they are to procure thereby, 
but simply because they find in the free play of their energies 
an immediate satisfaction and joy. When the sympathetic 
observer stands in rapt admiration before some great master- 
piece of painting or sculpture, or when ear and soul yield 
themselves up to the charm of the great composer’s art in song, 
cantata, opera, oratorio, and vague, undefined emotions, pas- 
sionate or pathetic, are awakened within the breast, no thought 
of ulterior use or profit crosses the mind. Its experience is 
that of absorption in present, immediate enjoyment. And, on 
the other hand, if we think of the attitude of the artist’s mind 
in producing, equally foreign to it is the aim at anything beyond 
the work itself. He paints or sings or writes simply because 
the creative impulse is upon him, and he cannot choose but 
give it vent; because a dream of beauty has taken possession 
of his soul, and it is joy or rapture to him to express it. 
But while this view of the essentially non-utilitarian char- 
acter of art may be freely conceded, there is nothing inconsistent 
with the concession in claiming for works of art a higher func- 
tion than that of recreation or amusement, or in the assertion 
that they contribute in no slight or inappreciable measure 
to the formation of character and the intellectual and moral 
education of the community. In making this claim, however, 
it must be admitted that, in one point of view, the principle 
of “art for art’s sake” is profoundly true. The educative 
function of art is, at best, an indirect one. Whatever intel- 
lectual enlightenment or moral elevation is to be gained from 
works of imagination, to communicate such benefits cannot 
be the conscious aim of the artist; nor is the merit of his work 
to be estimated by its didactic excellencies. Bad or indifferent 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  118 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
painting or poetry is no more redeemed from artistic inferiority 
by the moral or religious aim of the author than ill-dressed 
food or ill-made clothes by the respectability or piety of the 
cook or tailor. And, on the other hand, a poem or picture 
may have many of the highest qualities of art, though the sub- 
ject may be coarse or voluptuous, or the treatment such as 
to offend our moral susceptibilities. 
The poetry of Shelley and Byron contains much which, 
from a religious or moral point of view, cannot escape censure, 
while the literary form is of the highest artistic merit. The 
works of Dr. Watts and Mr. Tupper are full of pious teaching 
and unexceptional moralizing, yet, regarded as poetry, both 
are execrable. The deepest truth, in short, the noblest moral 
lessons may be conveyed in a form of art, but it is as uncon- 
sciously, with as little of a didactic aim, as are the lessons 
which Nature herself is ever teaching. The teachings of rock 
and stream and sea, the moralities addressed to us by stars 
and flowers, by autumn woods and mountain solitudes, do not 
reach us in the form of argumentative disquisitions, but of 
feelings and emanations which win their way insensibly into the 
soul. There are better sermons in stones and in the running 
brooks than human pen ever indited, but the lessons which 
these unconsecrated preachers address to us are innocent 
of logic or formal admonition. 
Oh, to what uses shall we put 
The wild-weed flower that simply blows 
And is there any moral shut 
Within the bosom of the rose? 
But any man who walks the mead 
In bud or blade or bloom may find, 
According as his humors lead, 
A meaning suited to his mind; 
And liberal applications lie 
In Art, like Nature, dearest friend, 
So ’twere to cramp its use if T 
Should hook it to some useful end. 
And the reason for what has now been said is obvious. It 
arises from the very nature of art as distinguished from sci- 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 119 
ence. Works of imagination and works of instruction may 
treat of common subjects. The painter may depict, the poet 
sing, of the same scenes, persons, events, objects, whereof the 
naturalist, the historian, the philosopher discourses. But the 
aspects in which the two sorts of observers contemplate the 
common objects are essentially different; nor is it possible to 
combine in the same work an artistic and a scientific view of 
a subject, without sacrificing the peculiar excellence of both. 
In proportion to its merits as a work of science it will be bad 
as a work of art, and the very qualities which make it good 
art will make it bad science. The same tract of country, to 
take a palpable illustration, may be represented in landscape 
painting and in a map. But the painter who tried to embody 
in his work the precise and definite information of the map, 
would make it a wretchedly bad picture, and the geographer 
would spoil his map, if he tried to introduce the artistic effects 
of light and shade into his delineation of the boundaries of 
countries and of mountains, rivers, and streams. An anatomical 
drawing or model and a figure in sculpture deal both with the 
human frame; but if the sculptor is moved by the desire to 
display his anatomical knowledge, the ineffable grace and beauty 
we demand in a work of art vanishes, and what we get is neither 
science nor art, but only artistic pedantry. Or, to take but 
one other example, the conflicting and essentially inconsistent 
aims of science and art are exemplified in so-called didactic 
poems and novels with a purpose. A novel, say, may be written 
to illustrate some theory of life or to expose some social or 
political abuse—the evils of intemperance, the bad effects of 
the land or marriage laws, or what not. But what will be the 
inevitable result? The writer may be in the structure of his 
mind either mainly artist or mainly theorist. If the art-in- 
stinct predominates, there will be a constant temptation to 
sacrifice the didactic purpose to the exigencies of artistic treat- 
ment. Whenever the effective development of the plot would 
be marred by a too copious introduction of facts or a strict 
adherence to theory, the art impulse triumphs and fact or 
theory are ruthlessly sacrificed. If, on the contrary, the writer 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 120 
is too conscientiously bent on the communication of informa- 
tion or the advocacy of a doctrine to care punctiliously for ar- 
tistic effect, the result is a nodes performance which 
gives neither information nor delight. 
Though, however, it is not the direct function of art to teach, 
yet it does teach. Without direct scientific or ethical aim, 
works of imagination are not only the means of purest enjoy- 
ment, but they convey to us an order of ideas of an altogether 
peculiar kind, reveal to us in nature and in human life much 
which it lies beyond the province of science or philosophy to 
disclose, and exert over the moral nature an elevating and 
ennobling influence, in some respects the more potent that 
it is not their cen purpose to produce it. 
What then, let me ask, is the sort of teaching which it is 
the Pecans vocation of art to communicate, what is the 
peculiar class of ideas of which works of imagination, in dis- 
tinction from all other productions of human thought, are the 
vehicles? The answer to this questio 
given by saying that it is the office of 
and life, or to present their facts and phe! 
aspect. 
Does this answer mean that human 
nature:as God made it, or on human li 
ordered it? Can the loftiest genius inve 
the most soaring imagination conceive, 
depict, forms more lovely, lights more di 
tone and color more subtle and various 
have but to open our eyes to behold? Bri

or flinging abroad with munificence of departing greatness its 
treasures of purple and vermilion and gold, ere it passes away 
with infinite gradations of fading splendor bereath the western

horizon; the sea rippling up with gentle, scarce perceptible 
insinuation over the long reaches of the pebbly shore, or rush- 
ing with wild impetuosity and hoarse clang of assault on the 
cliffs of an iron-bound coast; a mountain lake “in the light 
of the rising moon and of the first stars twinkling against the 
dusky silverness of twilight”:—what, it may be said, has 
human art to do with its own inventions when, in myriads 
of such scenes and aspects, with inexhaustible wealth of love- 
liness, nature awaits, yet baffles man’s utmost skill to copy 
her? Nay, before he presumes to draw on the resources of 
his own imagination, let the artist take the commonest natural 
objects, the merest patch of earth or sea or sky—a pool, a 
spray of hawthorn, a clump of heather, a cloud floating on 
the summer sky—and say, whether, after his most patient 
and protracted toil, he has succeeded in reproducing an ex- 
haustive representation of what is before his eyes? 
To this the answer is that, even if it were true that the 
artist has no other function than to record what he sees in 
nature, it is not every eye that can see what he sees. Nature 
reflects herself in the mirror of man’s mihd, but the mirror in 
most cases is opaque or dim, sometimes distorted and frac- 
tured, and the reflection takes its character from the medium 
by which it is produced. For the scientific man the outward 
facts, confused, accidental, unordered, which are all that the 
ordinary observer perceives, become luminous with the pres- 
ence of hidden laws and relations. For the artistic or poetic 
observer, for the mind that is in sympathy with the soul of 
things—sensuous forms, colors, motions, are alive with the 
spirit of beauty, transfigured with the hidden glow and splen- 
dor of a light that other eyes see not—a light that never was 
on land or sea. And it is his high vocation, not merely to 
copy, to tickle our imitative susceptibilities by a matter-of- 
fact imitation of what we saw before, but through the language 
of imagination to interpret nature, and make us look upon her 
face “with larger, other eyes than ours.” 
But we may go further than this, and boldly say that there 
is a sense in which art does “improve in nature.” All art

in thus claiming for 
something to nature, 
place even in the do- 
arts. Every piece of 
d higher than nature 
ooms, steam engines, 
derive their materials 
tural forces and laws,   but in their production a new, commanding, selecting, trans- 
forming element comes into play, co 
amidst nature’s forces, to wit, the eleme 
or conception of the inventor. And i 
which we call by eminence the realm   ce nature’s raw 
materials into new combinations, itsel f the supreme force 
t of thought, the idea 
like manner in that 
f art, i.e, everything 
  is based on nature and must, in a sense, b e true to her; but that 
which constitutes the most precious element in the great work 
of art, that which arrests and holds the appreciative mind, is 
not nature slavishly copied, literally, mechanically reproduced, 
but the idea, the inspiring thought, the soul of the artist speak- 
ing to our soul and causing nature to shine for us with a super- 
natural significance and glory. 
It is of course true that there is a kind of art which pos- 
sesses nothing of this ideal element; and that, as there are un- 
inspired day-laborers in art who can, Jat most, by technical 
skill produce mechanical copies of common facts and inci- 
dents, so there are innumerable patrons of art of the same 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  
THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM 123 
order, in whose eyes vulgar imitation is the highest or only 
criterion of merit. But the highest praise which such pro- 
ductions deserve is that, at most, of clever mimetic legerdemain. 
They come no nearer to true art than the feats of the ven- 
triloquist to eloquence, or the representations of political and 
other celebrities in Madame Tussaud’s gallery ' to sculpture. 
Who amongst us cannot recall hundreds of exact, speaking 
likenesses of nobodies, prosaically accurate as the armchairs 
on which they sit, or the official robes with which they are 
bedecked—portraits of which the best that can be said is 
that the subject and the limner were worthy of each other? 
And to see what true art can do, compare the wooden fidelity 
of such productions with the relation which a characteristic 
portrait of a man, worthy of a great painter’s powers, bears 
to the actual fleshly form and features of the subject. Here 
you have no reproduction of facts as you could measure them 
by rule and compass. A thousand irrelevant details that would 
only mislead and distract are left out. What is most significant 
of the soul and spirit is disengaged frors what is purely ar- 
bitrary. What belongs to the inner essence of the man is so 
grasped and rendered that all that meets the eye—look, atti- 
tude, action, expression—is instinct with meaning, and every- 
thing else is subordinated to that in which the man was most 
himself, and which made him the special individuality he was. 
Of a work which thus fulfills the conditions of true art it may 
be said that in it the subject stands revealed to us more clearly 
than in his actual presence the common eye could discern him. 
Its power to evoke reality is like that which our greatest poet 
ascribes to memory recalling the image of a dear face and form we 
see no more: 
The idea of her life shall sweetly creep 
Into his study of imagination; 
And every lovely organ of her life 
Shall come appareled in more precious habit, 
More moving delicate and full of life, 
Into the eye and prospect of his soul 
Than when she lived indeed.

And this leads me to add, lastly, tha 
art to idealize not only nature but huma

only in form, prose fiction, that this fu 
filled. What a characteristic portrait

No writer can reproduce the whole o

but creative or poetic,—a capacity, in other words, not simply. 
of reflecting what lies on the surface, but of seeing under it 
and getting at the heart of life’s mystery—a capacity of taking 
up the scattered materials of experience and fusing them in the 
fire of imagination into a new organic whole, every element in 
which is full of significance. 
It is true that realism often implies no common gifts. It 
needs powers of observation and graphic delineation, such as few 
possess, to produce a vivid picture of even the superficial 
aspects of life. It is no despicable talent which enables a man 
to catch up and arrest the evanescent, fugitive play of light 
and shade on the surface of society, to reflect in fixed colors the 
light flow and ripple of its follies, its vanities, its absurdities, or to 
portray without exaggeration its vulgarity, its meanness, its 
baseness. Yet with all the talent displayed in popular realistic 
fiction of the last and present centuries, it may be questioned 
whether the result even at the best is one to which the honor 
of true art can be ascribed. ‘Truthfulness and reality are 
great qualities in an artist, but the realism that copies the 
surface only is often more untrue to nature than the wildest 
vagaries of fancy. Verisimilitude that is faithful only to the 
outside is not seldom as deceptive as downright falsehood. 
The life of clubs and drawing-rooms, of gossip, flirtation, and 
match-making, of dining and dressing, of flippant talk and 
conventional manners—this, even among those whom it pur- 
ports to represent, is not the true life of men and women, even 
the meanest of them. . If it were, so far from laboriously re- 
cording, it were better for us in shame and sorrow to ignore and 
forget it. And the same is true of the realistic novel of low life. 
The literalism, however clever, is surely unprofitable, which 
invites us to occupy time and thought with minute and weari- 
some details of the dress, the surroundings, the food, the man- 
ner of speech, of the dwellers in London back lanes and hovels— 
with the slang of costermongers and the chaff of omnibus- 
drivers, with inventories of the furniture of the tap-room or 
of the articles on the shelves of the pawnbroker’s shop.

of men, as in the development of nations, the highest type of 
aera like the finest yrder of citizenship, is developed 
under conditions of freedom; that the virtue which blossoms 
under the clear sky has a finer fragrance than that which de- 
velops in the cloister; that the finest efforts of education, like 
the ripest fruits of civilization, are to be sought where the 
realization of human freedom is most perfect. 
For two thousand years, from the schools of Athens and 
Rome to those of Berlin and Boston, schools which seek to 
deal with the general training of youth have differentiated in 
accordance with their adherence to one or another of these 
fundamental ideals, or in accordance with their effort to com- 
bine the two. The differences which exist to-day among the 
stronger American colleges as to what the college ought to do, 
as well as the reasons which are advanced for a separation of 
the college from the high school on one side and from the uni- 
versity on the other, rest on the relative weight which is at- 
tached to the educational ideal of discipline or the educational 
ideal of freedom. And the place which the college is ultimately 
to have will be fixed by the decision whether it is to represent 
squarely the ideal of discipline, the ideal of freedom, or both. 
It is also to be remembered that each of these educational 
ideals has its relations to the development both of character 
and of intellect, and each may be interpreted differently ac- 
cording as one views it from the standpoint of the individual, 
or from the standpoint of the social order in which he moves. 
Personal discipline and social discipline, individual freedom 
and the freedom which can be had only by social organization, 
are all involved in the scheme of general education, but it is 
rare to have all of these phases simultaneously under the 
view of the same eyes. Specializing in education began at the 
beginning in the very conceptions of the fundamental processes 
by which education was to be effected. 
In actual practice, American colleges represent to-day all 
the combinations and the compromises of these two concep- 
tions. At one extreme are colleges organized to prescribe fixed 
lines of conduct and specified courses of study; at the other
-P-A-G-E-152
        
     130 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
  are colleges so planned as to spread out before the eyes of the 
eighteen-year-old boy an almost endless variety of sports and 
of studies from which he may choose at will. In the first 
group, the idea of discipline is paramount, with the emphasis 
on the interests of organized society; in the second, the ideal 
of freedom is dominant, and the interests and development 
of the individual direct the line of vision. 
There are perhaps no better illustrations‘of the consistent 
working out of the ideals of discipline and freedom than the 
two great colleges, West Point and Harvard, for each of which 
I have an unusual admiration and a sincere affection (having 
sent a boy through each). They represent more consistently 
than most colleges distinct educational policies, and for this 
reason, as well as for their nation wide influence, they furnish 
unusual lessons for the guidance of other colleges. The one 
is a college of discipline by virtue of a policy largely fixed by the 
traditions of army service; the other a college of freedom—a 
response in large measure to the leadership of a great man. 
In the one are assembled some four hundred and fifty boys; 
in the other, some two thousand three hundred. The two groups 
of students enter their respective institutions at practically 
the same age, and are widely representative of alert American 
youth. The student in the one case becomes part of an organi- 
zation whose ideal is discipline; the other enters a régime 
whose watchword is individual freedom. In the one, the boy 
of eighteen is ordered to comply with a rigid régime which 
for four years undertakes to arrange for each day, and almost 
for each hour, his work and his play, and the amount of money 
he may spend; in the second, he is invited to choose from a 
numerous list of studies and of sports as he will. 
The strict discipline of the one, no less than the perfect 
freedom of the other, is, of course, tempered by the cross 
currents which run in all human affairs. The West Point 
plebe soon discovers that the austere economy of cadet life — 
is mitigated by an underground arrangement through which 
New York tradesmen extend a practically unlimited credit, 
to be harvested on the far distant graduation day—a process 
    
-P-A-G-E-153
     CHOICE OF COURSES 131 
which makes the problem of how to live on your income not 
materially different at the two colleges. 
On the other hand, the Harvard freshman who, with the 
aid of an anxious parent, undertakes to select five courses 
from an apparently inexhaustible supply, finds his freedom 
seriously limited at the outset by a certain evident tendency 
on the part of teachers and students to crowd the most de- 
sirable courses in the hours between nine and one. More- 
over, if the boy has athletic tastes, he is likely to get a warning 
from the coach to avoid afternoon classes and laboratory 
exercises, a consideration which may limit the freedom of 
choice in a surprising manner, and sometimes turns the honest 
freshman from a course in elementary chemistry to one in the 
history of the fine arts. 
The West Point cadet, once entered upon his work, finds 
his studies absolutely determined for him. Whether he will or 
not, he must take an assigned measure of mathematics, science, 
modern languages, drawing, history, and dancing (this last is a 
good required study in any college). He becomes a member 
of a section of perhaps ten. The assigned lesson will cover 
each day certain pages of a text-book. At the call of the in- 
structor, he must rise, put his heels together, begin with the 
formula, “I am required to recite, etc.”; and is most successful 
when he repeats the exact language of the text-book which is 
his guide. He must be ready every day, and his standing in 
comparison with every other man in his class is posted at the 
end of each week, made out to the fractional part of a per cent. 
The hours for work and play are fixed, and he may not go 
beyond the limits of the West Point reservation. Through 
the whole four-year course runs consistently the ideal of per- 
sonal discipline. 
His courses once chosen, the Harvard freshman finds himself 
one of a group of twenty or five hundred, according to the 
subject. If he occupies his place with fair regularity, he may 
work earnestly or very little. There is no day-by-day demand 
upon him such as the West Point cadet must expect. With 
occasional tests during the term—generally not difficult—and
-P-A-G-E-154
  132 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
an examination at the end, which a mark of sixty per cent 
will pass, the subject is credited to him as a completed study. 
Meanwhile the opportunities for reading, for individual study, 
for fellowship, and for amusement, are unlimited. Individual 
freedom is the keynote of his college life. 
Both of these colleges are noble agencies for the education 
of men; both have sent into our national life graduates who 
have done honor alike to their institutions and to their country. 
The remembrance of this fact ought to help towards educational 
liberality. It serves to remind us that, after all, we have no 
specifics in education; that men come into a larger usefulness, 
and into a finer intellectual and spiritual life, by many paths. 
Discipline and freedom both play their parts in the evolution 
of the best human character, and we may therefore not wonder 
that institutions varying so widely in ideals and in methods 
have alike achieved a high measure of success, and have won 
a place of singular honor and regard in the nation’s estimate. 
Colleges, like all human organisms designed for moral. and 
spiritual training, stand between the tendency to take the color 
of their environment, both good and bad, and the conscious 
duty to stand against certain tendencies of the society in 
which they exist. This is only another way of saying that 
colleges have a duty both to society and to the individual 
student and teacher. In the college of discipline, the tendency 
is to emphasize the duty to society as represented by the 
organization, at the expense of the individual; in the college 
of freedom, the tendency is to emphasize the rights of the 
individual at the expense of the social organization. The one 
view loses sight of the fact that discipline, to be effective, must 
in the long run be self-discipline; the other tends to overlook 
the truth that, in civilization, freedom for the individual is a 
function of the observance of social restraints. As a result, 
both the college of discipline and the college of freedom are 
peculiarly exposed to the prevailing American tendency to 
superficiality, but for exactly opposite reasons: the first on 
account of the multiplicity of standards, and the latter on 
account of the lack of definite standards,
-P-A-G-E-155
  
CHOICE OF COURSES 133 
In the college of discipline, the standards tend to become 
so numerous that the process of living up to them becomes 
disciplinary rather than educational. This arises out of the 
qualities of human nature. Once give to a group of men the 
power to select the things which other men ought to do or 
ought to learn, and the difficulties of moderation are great. 
In government, over-legislation, and in education, an over- 
. crowded curriculum, is the almost universal result. 
In nearly all schools with prescribed courses there has gone 
on for years a process of adding to the list of studies until 
the student is asked to absorb more in four years than he can 
possibly digest in that time. This régime is intensified at West 
Point by two facts peculiar to its organization—the low en- 
trance requirements, and the lack of instructors who are mas- 
ters of their subjects, able not only to hear recitations, but to 
impart intellectual enthusiasm. 
If the currents which run toward superficiality in the col- 
lege of discipline are sometimes strong, it is certain that those 
which flow in this direction in the college of freedom are some- 
times even swifter. 
The fundamental objection to a régime of complete freedom 
for eighteen-year-old boys, independent of some test of their 
capacity to use it, lies to my thinking in the lack of standards 
which under these conditions prevail among students, and the 
exaggerated tendencies toward superficiality which are thereby 
not only invited, but practically assured. Two features of the 
college to-day are specially significant of the practical outcome 
of these tenleacies in the undergraduate college under the 
conditions of free election. These are the decadence of schol- 
arly ideals, and the growth of secondary agencies for getting 
boys through college with a minimum of study. 
If the college is to serve as a means for the general education 
of men, it is of course unlikely that any large percentage of 
college youths should turn out to be scholars. But so long as 
the college stands primarily for scholarly ideals, the conditions 
in it should be such that the ninety per cent who are not schol- 
ars should respect and admire the ten per cent who are. Such
-P-A-G-E-156
134 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
a condition holds at Oxford and Cambridge. To say that it 
does not exist in our larger American colleges is to put the case 
mildly. The captain of the football team has more honor in 
the college community than any scholar may hope for. It is a se- 
rious indictment of the standards of any organization when 
the conditions within it are such that success in the things for 
which the organization stands no longer appeal effectively to 
the imaginations of those in it. 
The old-time conception of culture was narrow. It has 
rightly given way before the enlarging intelligence of man- 
kind. Nevertheless it did furnish standards by which not 
only teachers and scholars were able to orient themselves with 
respect to intellectual ideals, but society as well. Is not the 
time perhaps ripe for a broader and truer definition of culture 
in education? 
So few standards are to-day left in the college which gives 
itself completely to the régime of individual freedom that the 
world has but scant data to judge of its educational efficiency. 
The minimum intellectual equipment which a college education 
ought to furnish to a youth should enable him to do two things: 
first, to turn his mind fully and efficiently to the solution of a 
given problem. In the second place, it should give him the 
analytic point of view, the ability to discriminate. Whether, 
judged on this basis, our colleges show to-day a fair coefficient of 
educational efficiency, I do not undertake to say, but I should 
like to see some estimate of it attempted. 
The by-products of an organization are sometimes the most 
distinctive tests of its efficiency. There is, to my thinking, 
no more striking evidences of the tendency to superficiality 
which have developed in our larger colleges than the agencies 
which have grown up about them for getting boys into college, 
and for passing them through it with the minimum amount 
of work. By the more successful and profitable coaching 
agencies, this process has been reduced to an art. Such para- 
sites weaken the character-making and the scholarly side of 
college life, and have to the legitimate work of a college much 
the same relation that a lobby has to a legislative body.
-P-A-G-E-157
CHOICE OF COURSES 135 
It is a delicate thing to determine how much freedom is 
good for an individual or a nation. We must also admit that 
freedom means the right to be weak as well as the right to be 
strong; the ability to be foolish as well as wise. In education, 
as in government, moderation becomes difficult once a group 
of men undertakes to set bounds to freedom. There is prob- 
ably no attribute of the Almighty which men find so difficult 
to understand, or to imitate, as the ability to let things alone, 
the power not to interfere. 
And yet it is perfectly clear that some individuals, and 
some nations, have had more freedom than they knew what 
to do with, and such individuals and such nations have gen- 
erally ended by becoming not only less efficient, but less free. 
I have not been able to persuade myself that the eighteen-year- 
old American boy has yet demonstrated his fitness for so large 
a measure of freedom as is involved in the free elective system. 
Groups of boys whom I have studied under such conditions 
have generally recalled Wordsworth’s phrase:— 
Some souls (for such there needs must be) 
Who have felt the weight of too much liberty. 
The special function of the college seems to me to be, not 
to hold up exclusively the ideal of discipline or of freedom, but to 
serve as a transition school in which the boy grows out of one 
into the other. This conception of the college seems to me 
justified on the grounds of individual rights, social interest, 
and the efficiency of educational organization. 
The process of transition from the tutelage of the boy to 
the freedom of the man is one of the difficult questions of 
civilized life. No method of solving it is perfect, or is adapted 
to every boy. German boys go from the strict régime of 
the gymnasium to the freedom of the university. They are 
older than the boys who enter American colleges, and are far 
better educated than they. The cost of the process is re- 
flected in the saying current in the universities, that one-third 
of the students fail, one-third go to the devil, but the remain- 
ing third govern Europe. It seems clear that, under any system  
-P-A-G-E-158
  
  136 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
which makes the transition from discipline to freedom abrupt, 
many are taken. The special function of the college would seem 
to make the transition less expensive. | Otherwise there seems 
little reason for departing from the German plan of a strong 
secondary school leading directly to the university. 
It seems clear that a college must take account of its duty 
to the social order in which it exists, as well as to the indi- 
vidual. It is not enough for the college to reflect indiscriminately 
the strength and the weakness of the nation. It must stand 
against the current of superficiality and commercialism which 
are our national weaknesses. It is difficult to see how this 
duty to society is to be carried out by the college unless there 
be admitted some relation between the amount of freedom 
accorded to a boy and his ability to use it. 
Until very recently, the college was at the top of our edu- 
cational fabric. It had no direct relation to professional edu- 
cation. So long as this was true, the changes in our standards 
operated simply to raise the college standards. So long as 
there was nothing beyond it, this went on without much ques- 
tioning. For the future, the college is to be a part of a general 
system of education; and the university, with its professional 
schools and its schools of research, is to rest upon it. In no 
other form of educational organization is the college likely 
permanently to survive. 
If the college is to be a school of free choice, it can scarcely 
take its students earlier than the present age, eighteen and a 
half. This brings the youth too late to the university. The 
picture of the university resting on a four-year college, which 
in turn rests on a four-year high school, reminds one forcibly 
of Chicago in the early days when the houses were boosted 
up on posts. The arrangement fitted a passing phase of mu- 
nicipal growth. 
The pressure of economic, no less than educational, influ- 
ences will demand a solution of American educational organi- 
zation more efficient, better proportioned, and less wasteful 
of time, than that involved in a régime which delivers men 
to the university at the age of twenty-three.
-P-A-G-E-159
  CHOICE OF COURSES 137 
In the reorganization which will sooner or later come, the 
college years seem to me likely to be those between sixteen 
and twenty, rather than those between eighteen and twenty- 
two. Under such an arrangement the college will take account 
both of discipline and of freedom. Its professors will be, first 
of all, teachers, and its function will be to lead boys out of the 
tule of the school into the freedom of the university; out of the 
tutelage of boyhood into the liberty of men. If the college 
does not fill this function, it will in the end be squeezed out 
between the reorganized secondary school and the fully de- 
veloped university. 
Meantime we may well be grateful both for the college of 
discipline and for the college of freedom. These are great 
words, and each stands for an idea in education which we 
cannot afford to forget. Perhaps it might be well to inscribe 
over the gate of the college of discipline and that of the college 
of freedom the sentence which surmounts the Worcester Courts: 
“Tn Obedience to the Law is Liberty”—in the first case the 
emphasis. to be laid on one part of the sentence, and in the 
other case on another part.

[James Hulme Canfield (1847-1909) was an American educator of long

President of Ohio State University 1895-9. From 1899 to his death, he 
was librarian of Columbia University.] 
At the opening of your junior year, in many institutions 
even before that year, you will find that you may make choice 
of one or more subjects in place of those appearing in the reg- 
ular curriculum; that you may “elect” which one or more sub- 
jects you will consider. In some colleges the courses are fixed, 
or “required,” throughout the first two years, with some freedom 
of movement in the junior year, and more in the senior year. 
In others a student is permitted, even in his freshman year, to 
choose one of three sciences; in his sophomore year, to make 
certain selections in the general division of history and political 
science, or within the lines of the division of English; while 
his last two years become quite free. Sometimes this is ex- 
pressed as a choice of so many “hours’ work” in any division, 
department, or school of the university; generally about two- 
thirds of the total number of hours required. Many institu- 
tions demand that one of the courses selected shall be known 
as a major course, to which possibly two-thirds of the entire 
schedule time shall be given, the remaining time to be spent 
upon a minor, which shall be cognate to the major: as, an 
English history major with contemporaneous continental his- 
tory as a minor; or Latin as a major with Romance languages 
as a minor. Generally, certain degrees can be obtained only 
by meeting certain fixed requirements on definite lines; this 
demand satisfied, the student may turn freely in any other 
direction. If the student has determined what his professional 
work is to be, some institutions permit him to elect a part of

that work in place of part or all of the usual studies of his 
last college year, a plan which counts the same work toward 
each of two degrees, and shortens the aggregate time usually 
required for both the college work and that of the professional 
school. 
All this has come about slowly, with no little opposition, 
and with many honest differences of opinion, and has happened 
(for its advance has been rather casual than regular) because 
a greater range and keenness of intellectual vision has dis- 
covered that there are a large number of studies having great 
educational value and power which are outside the accepted 
curriculum; and that the number of these subjects is too large 
to be definitely included in any fixed curriculum. Admitting 
that all are desirable and valuable, though perhaps. not equally 
valuable, there is but one logical issue: to permit the largest 
possible freedom of choice. Electives have not been estab- 
lished, therefore, to create an easy road to a degree; they are 
not intended to be regarded as a collection of soft snaps; it is 
not expected that they will become the refuge of every weak 
and timid man, the sauntering ground for every educational 
loafer, the safe harbor for every shirk; nor is this true of them— 
much that is said to the contrary notwithstanding. The elec- 
tive system has been misused and abused by both faculty 
and students, beyond question. It has been the means of 
relieving the student of much that has been distasteful to 
him, and for that very reason all the more salutary; and, un- 
doubtedly, some weak or mercenary instructors have used the 
system to bolster up their failing fortunes. Numbers of stu- 
dents and officers considered, it is doubtful whether there 
has been more abuse by one than by the other. But this mis- 
use really proves nothing as to the merits of the system; it 
simply bears upon the character, or want of character, of those 
who use the system to further their own private ends. In the 
hands of the ignorant or vicious, dynamite is exceedingly 
dangerous; but we have no serious thought of abandoning its use. 
There are two ways of using electives, either being desirable 
and helpful. Choice may be made of those subjects which 
   
-P-A-G-E-162
  140 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
will broaden the otherwise’ necessarily restricted course, or of 
those which will intensify some portion of it. As illustrations 
- of each, you may substitute three one-term studies for the 
last year of Latin, or you may take (practically) five years of 
Latin instead of four. Which of these courses you will pursue 
will depend very much upon the nature of your graduate work 
or of your work after graduation, upon your natural or acquired 
liking for a given subject, or upon the strength or attractiveness 
of some given instructor. As a fact, it is probable that the 
choice of studies is quite evenly divided between intensive and 
extensive work. From an educational standpoint, it is still 
doubtful which is the more desirable, or whether there is a 
psychologic choice between the two. It is probable that the 
wisdom of the choice is determined by several factors, in which 
the personal factor plays an important part. 
If your choice is for intensive work, your course is com- 
paratively plain. The department within which the subject 
falls necessarily determines the exact form of the work, and 
you are very completely under its guidance and practically 
dependent upon it for both opportunity and method. It were 
almost useless to. advise you, since you are bound to follow 
the lines which the department lays down. The only caution 
which may be given is to be sure not to substitute quantity 
for quality, not to fancy that you are doing well because you 
are doing much, and to avoid work offered by some shrewd 
and unscrupulous instructor—occasionally there is such a one, 
it must be confessed with shame—with the intention of ad- 
vancing his own personal reputation or departmental interests 
rather than of contributing to the cause of sound education 
and advanced learning. Fortunately, that quick insight, that 
instinct so surely developed in an earnest student, is a great 
protection; and students often detect a sham, and scent selfish- 
ness or fraud or incompetency, much sooner than those more 
directly responsible for the management of the institution. 
Unfortunately their own indolence or selfishness sometimes 
prompts them to profit by the weakness or shortsightedness of 
others; but they are generally very frank among themselves,
-P-A-G-E-163
  CHOICE OF COURSES 141 
and you will be rarely misled by the prevailing sentiment of 
the student body, or by any considerable portion of it, with 
regard to the actual value of the work of any given instructor. 
Only be thoroughly honest with yourself, and do not consent 
to thwart the very purpose of your becoming a collegian. 
In this, as in all other educational deceit, you really harm 
only yourself in the end. You have had given you time, oppor- 
tunity, and all the materials with which to build a house. 
You may slight the work if you will, you may use seconds 
and commons instead of clear lumber, you may put mill finish 
in place of hand dressing, you may cover defects with paint and 
putty, and you may succeed in putting up a building which 
will be favorably received on a final examination, and for 
which a diploma of merit may be awarded you. But you your- 
self must live in that house, and the longer you live in it the 
more will every defect become apparent, the greater will be 
your discomfort because’ of every dishonesty connected with 
its erection, and the more complete will be your humiliation 
and shame. Never use the elective system, then, in other 
than a most honest and faithful effort to strengthen your 
educational work and to enlarge your educational opportunities. 
If you decide to broaden your course, you are in less danger 
in the direction just indicated, because you will work in several 
departments; and as a class the members of our college facul- 
ties are peculiarly honorable, competent, unselfish, and worthy. 
Indeed, it is very doubtful whether any other profession can 
show a greater aggregate or a higher average of integrity in 
both character and work. You will always find this definite 
advantage in all elective work: it is generally on lines of es- 
pecial interest to the instructors as well as to the students, 
which fact naturally creates more than usual enthusiasm in 
both; and under these conditions the pace is rapid, the sense 
of fatigue is less, and there is a delight and satisfaction to be 
found only in that effort which is entirely voluntary and free, 
known only to those who are running a race absolutely of 
their own choosing. It is this which has caused many a student 
to feel and assert that he accomplished more, that his work
-P-A-G-E-164
  142 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
was “more to the purpose,” during his first term of electives 
than during any whole year of earlier work. There is much 
exaggeration in this.statement, and a student making it does 
not realize or else forgets that the success of his first term 
of electives is largely if not wholly conditioned upon and made 
possible by his earlier fixed work, with its strict discipline 
and sound training; yet there is much truth in the statement 
also. You should never forget, however, that in education as 
in civil life, perfect liberty is conditioned upon law, not upon 
license; indeed, with license liberty dies. Education ceases 
to be possible when intellectual vagabondage begins. In broad- 
ening your course, therefore, you are not to run hither and 
yon, getting here a little and there less, moving without definite 
purpose and stopping by chance, never Correlating your work, 
and securing an indigestible pot-pourri of all sorts of depart- 
mental odds and ends and leavings. It is all very well to 
dine 4 Ja carte, and any sensible man prefers it to a table d’héte, 
but if you mix cranberries and cream, and insist on putting 
sugar in your cup-consommé, you will simply make a decided 
mess of what might otherwise have been an attractive and 
palatable menu. 
Let me give you a few illustrations of wisely chosen elec- 
tives, with selections made with a view of broadening and 
enriching your course. You may not be able to find at the 
college of your choice the electives which are named here; 
but the themes will be at least suggestive for collateral reading, 
if you are so unfortunate as to fail of direct instruction therein. 
Let us suppose that you have had a half year’s work in the 
elements of political economy, and have become sufficiently 
interested to desire to extend that work. It ought to be possible 
for you to get a course in practical problems in economics—a 
rapid review of such themes as money, the tariff, railways, 
immigration. To this may be added work upon the history of 
industrial society; or the industrial and financial history of 
this country; or a more specific study of public finance and 
taxation, or of private financiering—such as credit and banking. 
Many institutions are now offering courses in trade and com-
-P-A-G-E-165

merce and in commercial geography, all of especial interest 
and value to Americans just now. 
Or suppose history to have become something more than a 
collection of the dry bones of dates and disconnected events. 
Then you may take a dip into the political and constitutional 
history of England, or the era of the Protestant reformation, 
or the stirring days of the French Revolution, or the political 
history of our own country, or the history of European col- 
onies—again a subject of most immediate and profound in- 
terest to us all. A half year, or even two hours a week for a 
half year, given to one or more of these themes, would go far 
toward making you a wise man and an intelligent and helpful 
citizen. 
Possibly philosophy or psychology prove interesting. You 
may follow the elementary work with the history of ancient 
and medieval and modern philosophic thought; or with a 
course in ethics; or with a half year of logic; or you may even 
go into the laboratory, and try some work in experimental 
psychology, without wm n ‘t is exceedingly difficult to get 
any very clear idea of the modern standpoint. 
General literature may be followed by special work on 
Shakespeare and the English drama, or on poetry or the novel. 
Greek may bring you to a study of ancient art; Latin, to that 
of inscriptions or antiquities. Rhetoric and English naturally 
lead to exercises in rapid writing, in brief-making and debating 
and public speaking, in criticism, and in translation. 
With every such advance you reach higher ground, you 
breathe and move more freely, your horizon is constantly ex- 
panding, you are larger in intellectual frame, your work is less 
mechanical, you come into more distinct and positive enjoy- 
ment of opportunity, hours which perhaps have dragged 
heavily in the past now disappear all too rapidly, growth 
has really begun, and you are experiencing the pure joy of living. 
I have left for my last word on electives that which is really 
the best word: this, that after all the greatest advantage in 
the elective system is that you have an opportunity to choose 
your instructor—a most blessed privilege, which you ought
-P-A-G-E-166
144 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
never willingly to neglect or forego. Always remember Mr. 
Emerson’s words, “It is little matter what you learn, the 
question is with whom you learn.”” What you most need as a 
student is not information, but teachers to whom you will be 
“profoundly and eternally indebted.” Even under most wise 
administration it is simply impossible ‘pitas a faculty made 
up entirely of men with distinct force of character, earnest- 
ness of life, constant industry, unfailing thoughtfulness and 
consideration, unflagging interest in seal student, and with a 
high degree of teaching power. Really, there are not enough 
of such men to “go around,” and the impossible can no more 
be achieved in education than in any other walk of life. Hence, 
there will always be in every faculty men who are indolent 
and selfish and given over to eye-service or lip-service only, 
and indifferent, even if not downright dishonest. All of which 
simply means that, though quite up to the average of other 
classes and callings—probably even somewhat superior to 
these—college professors are human, sometimes intensely 
human, not infrequently even disagreeably human. But it 
is generally true that every faculty possesses at least a few 
men who are vigorous, and full of fire and movement, men who 
have snap and go in them, men who can command the at- 
tention and respect of every man in the class room, who inspire 
and quicken into new life, and who hold till their last hour the 
warm interest and affectionate regard of all so fortunate as to sit 
under their instruction. The elective system enables you 
surely to get a taste of such a man, to move in his atmosphere 
for a little while at least, to feel the effect of his electric cur- 
rents, to know the thrill and uplift which come from daily 
association with such a character. It does not matter much 
what he teaches—elect it, in order that you may be able to 
elect him; and you will never regret your choice. Men are 
more valuable than subjects, and noe is far above 
information. 
The very best feature of the elective system, then, is that 
you may consciously and intelligently lpr the instruction 
and companionship of such a man.

SPECIALIZATION ! 
Grorce Hrrpert PALMER 
[George Herbert Palmer (1842—-—) was for many years a professor in 
the department of philosophy in Howard University. In 1913, he became 
professor emeritus. His writings cover a considerable range, including 
especially a notable translation of The Odyssey, a monumental edition of the 
poems of George Herbert, many stimulating essays in the field of ethics, 
and a striking biography of his wife, Mrs. Alice Freeman Palmer. This 
address was delivered at the Convocation of the University of Chicago, 
June, 1908.] 
This morning, I sat down to breakfast with about a hundred 
of you who had entered on the attainment of the highest degree 
which this University offers. You were advanced specialists. 
You had each chosen some single line of endeavor. But, as I 
sat there, I recalled that you were not the only specialists of 
this University. Before me this afternoon I see candidates 
in medicine, men and women who have taken for their specialty 
the warfare with pain and disease. They have said, “All that 
I can ever know, I will bring to bear on this urgent problem.” 
Here also are the lawyers, impassioned for justice, for the 
quelling of human strife. That is their specialty. They too 
restrict themselves to a single point of view. Beside them sit 
the scientific men, who looking over the vast expanse of nature 
say, “The physical aspects of this marvelous machine it will

be my duty to trace.” And why should I stop here? Through- 
out your undergraduate department, as we all know, run 
dominant interests. I should be ashamed of a young man 
who had not found here some such compulsive interest; for it 
is only when an interest compels that we can say that our 
education has begun. So long as we are simply learning that 
which is set before us, taking the routine mass of subjects, 
we may be students, but we are not scholars. No, it is when 
with a free heart we give ourselves to a subject and say, “Take 
of me all you demand—rather this I would do than anything 
else, for this expresses my personal desires”—then it is that a 
quickening education begins. But this is specialization. We 
might think of the University of Chicago, then, as a great 
specializing machine. 
But why have you set yourself this task of specialization? 
Because the world needs leaders and you have chosen yourself 
to be one of those leaders. Are you aware how exceptional 
is your condition? The last census shows that only a little 
over one per cent of our population is in our colleges. You 
are of that one per cent, and you are here in order that you 
may enlighten the other ninety-nine per cent. If through 
ignorance you fail, you will cause others to fail and you had 
better never have come to this University. To some sort of 
leadership you have dedicated yourself, and to this aim you 
should be true. But do not at times doubts cross your mind? 
Have you not occasionally asked yourself whether you can 
attain such leadership and make the most of your life—the 
only one that will be intrusted to you—by shutting yourself 
up to a specialty? Multitudes of interesting things are calling; 
shall you turn away from them and follow a single line? It 
will be worth while to-day to consider these fundamental 
questions and inquire how far we are justified in specializing, 
what dangers there are in it, and in what degree those dangers 
can be avoided.   Let me say, then, at the start, that 
as absolutely essential to scholarship. regard specialization 
ere is no scholarship 
without it, for it is involved in the very process of knowing.
-P-A-G-E-169

When I look at this desk I am specializing; that is, I am detach- 
ing this piece of furniture from all else in the room. I am 
limiting myself, and I cannot see without it. I can gaze without 
specialization, but I cannot see without specialization. If Iam to 
know anything by sight, that knowledge must come through 
the limitation of sight. I seize this object and cast away all 
others, and thus I fix my attention. Or if I am really care- 
fully to observe, I even put my eye on a single point of the 
desk. There is no other way. Clear knowledge becomes pos- 
sible only through precise observation. Now specialization is 
nothing but this necessary limitation of attention; and you, 
as specialists, are merely carrying out on a large scale what 
every one of us must practice in some degree whenever we 
know. You employ the process persistently, and for the sake 
of science are willing to hold yourselves steadily to a single line 
of observation. And you cannot do otherwise. The principles 
involved in the specialization of the senses run throughout the 
sciences. If we would know, we must hold the attention long 
on a given subject. 
But there is an unfortunate side to specialization. It obliges 
us to discard other important interests. To discard merely 
unimportant ones is easy. But every evening when I sit down 
to devote myself to my ethics I am aware that there are per- 
sons starving in Boston who might be saved if I should drop 
my work and go to them. Yet I sit calmly there and say, “Let 
them starve; I am going to study ethics.” I don’t see how I 
could be a suitable professor of ethics unless I were willing 
thus to limit myself. That is the hard part, as I understand it, of 
specialization—the cutting off of things that are worth while. 
I am sure you have already found it out. Many of you have 
come up here from places of narrow opportunity and you perceive 
the abundance that is here. Remembering how you have 
longed to obtain the opportunities here offered, you will be 
tempted to scatter yourself over a big field, and to pick up a 
little here and a little there. At the end of the year you will 
have nothing, if you do that. The only possibility of gain 
is to choose your field and say, “I devote serious time to this 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  148 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS hep PROBLEMS 
field; I am a specialist and I propose to live like one.” The 
great Goethe admirably announces the principle: ‘Wer grosses 
will muss sich beschriinken kénnen.”! You must accept limita- 
tions if you will go on to greatness; for, as we have seen, in 
limitation the very process of knowledge is rooted. 
Furthermore, not only is specialization forced upon us by 
the nature of knowledge, but without it our powers cannot 
receive appropriate discipline. It is difficult business to fashion 
a sound observer. Each province of science has its special 
modes of observation, its own modes of reasoning even. So 
long as we are unfamiliar with these and obliged to hold our- 
selves steadily to them by conscious control, our work is poor. 
It is slow, inaccurate, and exhausting. Only when we have 
trained ourselves to such aptitudes that within that field our 
observations and reasonings are instinctive do we become 
swift, sure, and unfatigued in research. To train your powers, 
then, you must begin to specialize early and hold yourselves 
steadily within your chosen field. I am sure as you look over 
the names of those who have accomplished much, you have been 
surprised at the number who became early specialists. Take 
my own department: Berkeley writes his great work when he 
is twenty-five; Hume publishes his masterpiece at twenty- 
seven. Or again, Keats had brought all his wonderful results 
to accomplishment and died at twenty-four, Shelley at thirty; 
Marlowe, the greatest loss English letters ever met, at twenty- 
seven. It is just the same in other fields; Alexander died at 
thirty-six, Jesus at thirty-three. Yes, let us look nearer home; 
the most forcible leader American education has ever had 
became president of Harvard University at thirty-five; Presi- 
dent Hyde of Bowdoin took his position at twenty-seven; my 
own wife, Alice Freeman, was president of Wellesley at twenty- 
six. These are early specialists; and because they specialized 
early. they acquired an aptitude, a smoothness of work, a pre- 
cision of insight, and width of power that could not have been 
theirs had they begun later. I would not deny that there 
have been geniuses who seemed to begin late: Kant was such; 
1Freely translated the passage means, He who would have greatness must limit himself. 
       
-P-A-G-E-171
  CHOICE OF COURSES 149 
Locke was such. You will recall many within your own fields. 
But I think when you search the career of those who come to 
power in comparatively late years, you will find that after all 
there has been a long train of covert specialization running 
through their lives. They may not have definitely named 
their field to themselves, or produced work within that field 
in early years, but everything had been converging toward 
that issue. I believe, therefore, you ought to respect your 
specialty because only through it can your powers be brought 
to their highest accuracy and service. 
One more justification of specialization I will briefly men- 
tion, that it is necessary for the organization of society. No 
motive is good for much until it is socialized. If specialization 
only developed our individual selves, we could hardly justify it; 
but it is the means of progress for society. The field of knowl- 
edge is vast, no man can master it, and its immensity was never 
so fully understood as to-day. The only way the whole prov- 
ince can be conquered and brought under subjection to human 
needs is by parting it out, one man being content to till his 
little corner while his neighbor is engaged on something widely 
different. We must part out the field of knowledge and special- 
ize on our allotted work in order that there may be entirety 
in science. If we seek to have entirety in ourselves, science 
will be fragmentary and feeble. That division of labor which 
has proved efficient everywhere else is no less needful in science. 
But I suppose it is hardly necessary to justify specialization 
to this audience. You have staked heavily on it; most of you 
have put yourselves to serious inconvenience, many of you 
have heavily mortgaged your future, in order to come here 
and devote yourselves to some single interest. I might con- 
fidently go through this room asking each one of you what 
is your subject? And you would proudly reply, My subject 
is this, My subject is this, My subject is this. I think you 
ould feel ashamed if you had not thus specialized. I see no 
ccasion, therefore, to elaborate what I have said. As I under- 
tand it, the three roots of ‘specialization are these: it is 
rounded in the very nature of the knowing process; it is    
   
     
     
                      
    
      
    
-P-A-G-E-172
1so_ COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
grounded in the needs of ourselves as individuals, in order 
that we may attain our maximum efficiency; it is grounded 
in the needs of society, because only so can society reach 
that fullness of knowledge from which it is richly fed. 
But after all, the beliefs which are accepted as matters of 
course in this room are largely denounced outside it. We 
must acknowledge that our confidence in specialization en- 
counters many doubts in the community. Would it not be 
well, then, for us to try to place ourselves where that com- 
munity stands and ask the general public to tell us why it 
doubts us, what there is in our specialized attitude which it 
thinks defective, what are the complaints which it is disposed 
to bring against us? I will try to take the position of devil’s 
advocate and plead the cause of the objector to specialization. 
Spécialization, it is said, leads to ignorance; indeed it rather 
aims at ignorance than knowledge. When I attend to this 
desk, it is true I secure a bit of knowledge, but how small is 
that bit in comparison to all the things in this room which I 
might know about. It is but a fraction. Yet I have con- 
demned all other things in the room to ignorance, reserving only 
this one little object for knowledge. Now that is what we 
are all of us doing on a great scale; by specializing, by limiting 
our attention, we cut off what we do not attend to. It is often 
assumed that attention is mainly a positive affair and occupied 
with what we are to know. But that is a very small portion 
of it; really its important part is the tbat a the removal of     
   
                                                  what we do not wish to observe. We cut ourselves off from 
the great mass of knowledge which is offered. Is it not then 
true that every specialist has disciplined himself to be an 
ignoramus? He has drawn a fence around a little portion of 
the universe and said, “Within that ings I know something.” 
“Yes,” the public replies, “but you don’t know anythin; 
outside.” And isn’t the public right? When we step forwar 
and claim to be learned men, isn’t the public justified in saying. 
“T know a great deal more than you do; I know a thousan 
things and you know only one. You sy you know that oni 
through and through, and of course I don’t know my thousan
-P-A-G-E-173
   CHOICE OF COURSES Ist 
things through and through. But it is not necessary. I per- 
ceive their relations; I can handle them; I can use them in 
practice; can you?” ‘Well, no,” we have to say, “we special- 
ists are a little fumbling when we try to take hold of the world. 
We are not altogether skillful in action, just because we are such 
specialists.” You have been devoting yourselves to some one 
point—I am afraid many of you are going to have sad experi- 
ence of it—you have been learning to know something nobody 
else on earth does know, and then you go forth to seek a position. 
But the world may have no use for you; there are only two or 
three positions of that sort in the country, and those may 
happen to be filled. Just because you are such an elaborate 
scholar you cannot earn your daily bread. You have cut 
yourself off from everything but that one sort of learning, and 
that doesn’t happen to be wanted. Therefore you are not 
wanted. Such is the too frequent condition of the specialist. . 
The thousand things he doesn’t know; it is only the one thing 
he does know. And because he is so ignorant, he is helpless. 
Turning then to our second justification of specialization, 
the case seems equally bad. I said that specialization was 
needed for the training of our powers. The training of them 
all? No, not that; but the training of only certain ones among 
them. The others hang slack. In those regions of ourselves 
we count for little. We are men of weight only within the 
range of those powers that we have trained; and what a large 
slice of us lies outside these! Accordingly the general public 
declares that there is nothing so bad as the bad judgment of 
a specialist. Few practical situations exactly coincide with 
his specialty, and outside his specialty his judgment is worse 
than that of the novice. He has been training himself in refer- 
lence to something precise, and the moment he ventures beyond 
that, the very exactitude of his discipline limits his worth. 
he man who has not been a specialist, who has dabbled in 
Il things, and has acquired a rough and ready common-sense, 
hat man’s judgment is worth something in a good many 
ifferent fields, but the judgment of the specialist is painfully 
oor beyond his own field. You remember how, in the comic

opera, the practice is satirized of appointing a person who has 
never been at sea to take charge of the navy of a great country. 
But that is the only sensible course to pursue. Put a specialist 
there, and the navy will be wretchedly organized, because the 
administration of the navy requires something more than 
seamanship specialization. It is necessary to co-ordinate sea- 
manship with many other considerations, and the man trained 
in the specialty of seamanship is little likely to have that 
ability. Therefore ordinarily we use our experts best by putting 
them under the control of those who are not experts. Common- 
sense has the last word. The co-ordinating power which has 
not been disciplined in single lines is what ultimately takes 
the direction of affairs. We need the specialist within his 
little field; shut him up there, and he is valuable enough; but 
don’t let him escape. That seems to be the view of the public. 
They keep the specialist confined because they utterly distrust 
his judgment when he extends himself abroad. 
And when we look at the third of our grounds for justifica- 
tion, social need, the public declares that the specialists are 
intolerably presumptuous. Knowing their own subject, they 
imagine they can dictate to anybody and do not understand 
how limited is their importance. Again and again it happens 
that because a man does know some one thing pretty well 
he sets himself up as a great man in general. My own province 
suffers in this respect more than most; for as soon as a man 
acquires considerable skill in chemistry or biology, he is apt 
to issue a pronunciamento on philosophy. But philosophy 
does not suffer alone. Everywhere the friends of the great 
specialist are telling him he has proved himself a mighty man, 
quite competent to sit in judgment on the universe; and he, 
forgetting that the universe and the particular subject h 
knows something about are two different things, really imagine: 
that his ignorant opinions deserve consideration. 
Now I suppose we must acknowledge that in all this blas. 
phemy against our calling, there is a good deal of truth. Thesi 
certainly are dangers which all of us specialists incur. I agre 
that they are inevitable dangers. Do not, however, on accoun'  
-P-A-G-E-175

of them abandon specialization and seek to acquire a mass of 
miscellaneous information. Bacon said, “I take all knowledge 
for my province.” If you say it, you will become not Bacons 
but fools. No, that is the broad road to ignorance. . But laying 
these profound dangers of specialization well to heart, assured 
that they beset us all, let us search for remedial measures. 
Let us ask how such dangers may be reduced to a minimum. 
Is there a certain way in which we may engage in the specialist’s 
research and still save ourselves from some of the evils I have 
here depicted? I think there is. To find it we will follow the 
same three avenues which have been leading us thus far. 
In regard to the first, the limitation of attention, I under- 
stand that, after all, our specialty cannot fill our entire life. 
We do sometimes sit down to dinner; we occasionally talk with a 
friend; we now and then take a journey; we permit ourselves 
from time to time to read some other book than one which 
refers to our subject. That is, I take it, if we are fully alive 
to the great danger that in specializing we are cutting off a 
large part of the universe, we shall be wise in gathering eagerly 
whatever additional knowledge we may, outside our specialty. 
And I must say that the larger number of eminent specialists 
whom I have happened to know have been men pretty rich in 
knowledge outside their specialties. “They were men who 
well apprehended the extreme danger of their ordinary modes 
of pursuit and who greedily grasped, therefore, at every bit 
of knowledge they could obtain which lay beyond their province. 
They appropriated all the wisdom they could; and merely 
because it did not exactly fit in with their specialty, they did 
not turn it away. I do not know how far it is wise to go in 
this effort to repair the one-sidedness in which most of us 
are compelled to live. A rather extreme case was once brought 
to my attention. There was a student at Harvard who had 
been a high scholar with me, and I found that he was also so 
specializing in the classics that when he graduated he took 
classical honors. Some years later I learned that he was one 
of the highest scholars in the Medical School. Meeting him 
a few years after he had entered his profession, I asked, “How 
     
            
   
                  
        
-P-A-G-E-176
  tsa COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
did it happen that you changed your mind so markedly? You 
devoted yourself to classics and philosophy in college. What 
made you finally decide to become a physician?” “Finally 
decide!” said he, “Why, from childhood up I never intended 
to be anything else.” “But,” I persisted, “I cannot be mis- 
taken in recalling that you devoted yourself in college to 
classics and philosophy.” ‘‘Yes,” he said, “I did, because I 
knew I should never have another chance at those subjects. 
I was going to give the rest of my life to medicine, so I took 
those years for classics and philosophy.” I asked, “Wasn’t 
that a great mistake; haven’t you now found out your blunder?” 
“Oh, no,” said he, “I am a much better physician on that ac- 
count; I could not have done half so well if I hadn’t had all 
that training in philosophy and classics.” Now I cannot 
advise such a course for everybody. It takes a big man to do 
that. If you are big enough, it is worth while laying a very 
large foundation; but considering the size on which most of 
us are planned, it is wiser to begin early and specialize from 
the very start. Other cases of a similar sort I recall, where a 
man saw that there was plenty of him and thought he could 
afford to build out some side of his being which he was not 
going to use directly in his profession and believed he might 
trust his energy to bring up the other sides later. 
Well, then, this is one mode of making up for the defects 
of specialization: We may pick up knowledge outside our 
subject. But it is an imperfect mode; you never can put away 
your limitations altogether. You can do a great deal. Use 
your odd quarter-hours wisely and don’t merely play at such 
times, understanding that these are precious seasons for ac- 
quiring the knowledge which lies beyond your province. Then 
every time you talk with anybody, lead him neatly to what 
he knows best, keeping an attentive ear, being a first-class 
listener, and seeking to get beyond yourself. By doing so 
you will undoubtedly much enlarge the narrow bounds to which 
you have pledged yourself. Yet this policy will not be enough. 
It will require to be supplemented by something more. There- 
fore I should say in the second place, that in disciplining our
-P-A-G-E-177
CHOICE OF COURSES 55 
powers we must be careful to conceive our specialty broadly 
enough. There lies our chief danger. There are two types 
of specialist. There is the man who regards his specialty as 
a door into which he goes and by which he shuts the world 
out, hiding himself with his own little interests. That is the 
petty, poor specialist, the specialist who never becomes a man 
of power, however much he may be a man of learning. But 
there is an entirely different sort of specialist from that; it is 
the man who regards his specialty as a window out of which 
he may peer upon all the world. His specialty is merely a 
point of view from which everything may be regarded. Con- 
sequently without departing from our specialty each of us 
may escape narrowness. Instead of running over all the earth 
and looking at it from a multitude of different points of view, 
the wise specialist chooses some point of view and says: “I 
will examine the universe as it is related to this.” Everything 
therefore has a meaning for him, everything contributes some- 
thing to his specialty. Narrowing himself while he is getting 
his powers disciplined, as those powers become trained he 
slacks them off and gives them wider range; for he knows 
very well that while the world is cut up into little parcels it 
never can be viewed rightly. It will always be distorted. 
For, after all, things are what they are through their relations, 
and if you snap those relations you never truly conceive any- 
thing. Accordingly, as soon as you have got your specialty, 
you want to begin to co-ordinate that specialty with every- 
thing else. Probably at first you fixed your attention on some 
single problem within a given field, but I dare say by this 
time you have discovered that you cannot master that problem 
without knowing the rest of the field also. Yet after you have 
gone on to know the rest of the field, that-is, have made your- 
self a fair master of that science, you will discover that that 
science depends on other sciences. Never was there an age 
of the world in which this interlocking of the sciences was so 
clearly perceived as in our day. Formerly it seemed possible 
to isolate a particular topic and know something of it, but 
in our evolutionary time we know nothing of that kind is
-P-A-G-E-178
  156 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS ie PROBLEMS 
possible. Each thing is an epitome of the universe. Have 
you been training your eye to see a world in a grain of sand? 
Can you look through your specialty out upon the total uni- 
verse and say: “I am a specialist merely because I don’t want 
to be a narrow man. My specialty is my telescope. Every- 
thing belongs to my province. I cannot, it is true, turn to it 
all at once. Being a feeble person I ee advance from point 
to point, accepting limitations; but just as fast as I can, having 
mastered those limitations, I shall cast them aside and press 
on into ever broader regions.” 
But I said specialization was fin dbeiast lly justified through 
the organization of society because by its division of toil we 
contribute our share to the total of human knowledge; and 
yet the popular objector declares that te are presumptuous, 
and because we have mastered our own specialty are apt to 
assume ourselves capable of pronouncing judgment over the 
whole field. Undoubtedly there is this danger; but such a 
result is not inevitable. The danger is one which we are per- 
fectly capable of setting aside. The temper of our mind is all 
important, and it is entirely within our control. What is the use 
of our going forth presumptuous persons? We certainly shall 
be unserviceable if we are persons of that type. That is not 
the type of Charles Darwin in biology, of William James in 
psychology, of Horace Howard Furness in. Shakespeare criti- 
cism, of Albert Michelson in physics. These are men as re- 
markable for modesty and simplicity ag for scholarly insight. 
The true characteristic of a learned specialist is humility. 
What we want to be training ourselves in is respect for other 
people. Our work would be of very little use if there were 
not somebody at our side who cared nothing for that work 
of ours and cared immensely for his own. It is our business 
to respect that other man, whether he respects us or not. We 
must learn therefore to look upon every specialist as a fellow- 
worker. Without him we cannot be perfect. Let us make 
ourselves as large as possible in order that we may contribute 
our little something to that to which all others are contrib- 
uting. It is this co-operative spirit which it should be yours
-P-A-G-E-179
  CHOICE OF COURSES 157 
to acquire. And it seems to me that you are under peculiarly 
fortunate circumstances for acquiring it. What strikes me as 
fatal is to have a group of young specialists taken and trained 
by themselves, detachedly, shut off from others. Nothing of 
that sort occurs here. Every day you have been rubbing 
shoulders with persons who have other interests than yours. 
When you walk to dinner, you fall in with a comrade who has 
been spending his day over something widely unlike that which 
has concerned you. Possibly you have been able to lead him 
to talk about it; possibly you have gained an insight into what 
he was seeking, and seen how his work largely supplements 
your own. If you have had proper respect for him and proper 
humility in regard to yourself, this great society of specialists 
has filled out your work for you day after day; and in that 
sense of co-operation, of losing yourselves in the common 
service of scientific mankind, you have found the veritable 
glory of these happy years.

SELF-RELIANCE + 
RatpH WALDO EMERSON 
[Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882) was the great American essayist and 
lecturer. Few writers have a more salutary effect upon their readers than 
Emerson. Some one has said, ‘‘I know of no author better fitted to nerve 
the young mind to truth and nobility than Emerson.” One of the stimulat- 
ing ideas that runs through his writings is “the infinitude of the private 
man”—a thought which this essay particularly bears upon. Probably no 
writer has surpassed him in power to express thought in few words. While 
his paragraphs and his essays are not to be studied as models of structure, 
his sentences are marvelously condensed, dignified, strong, and eloquent. 
In the well-known phrase of Ben Jonson, “his words are rammed with 
thought.” The essay, “Self-Reliance,” was first published in the Essays, 
First Series. Part of-it was taken from a lecture on “Individualism,” other 
passages from lectures on “Genius,” “Duty,” etc., in'a course delivered in 
1838-9.] | 
I read the other day some verses written by an eminent 
painter which were original and not conventional. Always 
the soul hears an admonition in such lines, let the subject 
be what it may. The sentiment they instill is of more value 
than any thought they may contain. _To. believe your own 
thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private 
-heart_is true for all men,—that is genius. Speak your latent 
conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for always 
the inmost becomes the outmost—and our first thought is ren- 
dered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment. Fa- 
miliar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit 
we ascribe to Moses, Plato and Milton is that they set at. 
naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men, but

what they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch 
that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, 
more than the luster of the firmament of bards and sages. 
Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. 
In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; 
they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great 
works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. 
They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with 
good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of 
voices is on the other side. Else to-morrow a stranger will say 
with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought 
and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame 
our own opinion from another. 
There is a time in every man’s education when he arrives 
at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is 
suicide; that he must take himself for better or worse as his 
portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no 
kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his 
toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him 
to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, 
and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor 
does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, 
one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and 
another none. It is not without pre-established harmony, 
this sculpture in the memory. The eye was placed where one 
ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. 
Bravely let him speak the utmost syllable of his confession. 
We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine 
idea which none of us represents. It may be safely trusted 
as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully im- 
parted, but God will not have his work made manifest by 
cowards. It needs a divine man to exhibit anything divine. 
A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his 
work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise 
shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not 
deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse 
befriends; no invention, no hope.

What pretty oracles nature yields us on this text in the 
face and behavior of children, babes, and even brutes. That 
divided and rebel mind, that distrust of a sentiment because 
our arithmetic has computed the strength and means opposed 
to our purpose, these have not. Their mind being whole, 
their eye is as yet unconquered, and when we look in their 
faces, we are disconcerted. Infancy conforms to nobody; 
all conform to it; so that one babe commonly makes four or 
five out of the adults who prattle and play to it. So God 
has armed youth and puberty and manhood no less with its 
own piquancy and charm, and made ‘t enviable and gracious 
and its claims not to be put by, if it will stand by itself. Do 
not think the youth has no force, because he cannot speak to 
you and me. Hark! in the next room who spoke so clear and 
emphatic? Good Heaven! it is he! it is that very lump of 
bashfulness and phlegm which for weeks has done nothing 
but eat when you were by, and now rolls out these words like 
bell-strokes. It seems he knows how to speak to his con- 
temporaries. Bashful or bold then, he will know how to make 
us seniors very unnecessary. 
The nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner, and 
would disdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to con- 
ciliate one, is the healthy attitude of human nature. How

looking out from his corner on such faa and facts as pass

by, he tries and sentences them on their merits, in the swift, 
summary way of boys, as good, bad, interesting, silly, elo- 
quent, troublesome. He cumbers himself never about -con- 
sequences, about interests; he gives an independent, genuine 
verdict. You must court him; he does not court you. But 
the man is as it were clapped into jail by his consciousness. 
As soon as he has once acted or spoken with éclat he is a com- 
mitted person, watched by the sympathy or the hatred of 
hundreds, whose affections must now enter into his account. 
There is no Lethe for this. Ah, that he could pass again into 
his neutral, godlike independence! Who can thus lose all 
pledge and, having observed, observe again from the same 
unaffected, unbiased, unbribable, unaffrighted innocence, must 
always be formidable, must always engage the poet’s and the 
man’s regards. Of such an immortal youth the force would 
be felt. He would utter opinions on all passing affairs, which 
being seen to be not private but necessary, would sink like 
darts into the ear of men and put them in fear. 
These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they 
grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society 
everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every 
one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in 
which the members agre#, for the better securing of his bread 
to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of 
the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self- 
reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, 
but names and customs. 
Whoso would be a man, must be a nonconformist. He 
who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by 
the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. 
Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of our own mind. 
Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of 
the world. I remember an answer which when quite young I 
was prompted to make to a valued adviser who was wont 
to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church. 
On my saying, What have I to do with the sacredness of tra- 
ditions, if I live wholly from within? my friend suggested, 
 
-P-A-G-E-184

—“But these impulses may be from below, not from above.” 
I replied, “They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am 
the devil’s child, I will live then from the devil.” No law 
can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad 
are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the 
only right is what is after my constitution; the only wrong 
what is against it. A man is to carry himself in the presence 
of all opposition as if everything were titular and ephemeral 
but he. I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to 
badges and names, to large societtes and dead institutions. 
Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and sways me 
more than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and speak 
the rude truth in all ways. If malice and vanity wear the 
coat of philanthropy, shall that pass? If an angry bigot as- 
sumes this bountiful cause of Abolition, and comes to me 
with his last news from Barbadoes, why should I not say to 
him, “Go love thy infant; love thy wood-chopper; be good- 
natured and modest; have that grace; and never varnish your 
hard, uncharitable ambiion with this incredible tenderness 
for black folk a thousand miles off. Thy love afar is spite at 
home.” Rough and graceless would be such greeting, but truth 
is handsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness 
must have some edge to it,—else it is none. The doctrine 
of hatred must be preached, as the counteraction of the doc 
trine of love, when that pules and whines. I shun father and 
mother and wife and brother when my genius calls me. I would 
write on the lintels of the door-post, Whim. I hope it is some 
what better than whim at last, but we cannot spend the day 
in explanation. Expect me not to show cause why I seek o 
why I exclude company. Then, again, do not tell me, as 
a good man did to-day, of my obligation to put all poor men 
in good situations. Are they my poor? I tell thee, thou fool 
ish philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the 
cent I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom 
I do not belong. There is a class of persons to whom by all 
spiritual affinity I am bought and sold; for them I will go 
to prison if need be; but your miscellaneous popular charities;
-P-A-G-E-185
  INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 163 
the education at college of fools; the building of meeting-houses 
to the vain end to which many now stand; alms to sots, and the 
thousandfold Relief Societies;—though I confess with shame 
I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a wicked dollar, 
which by-and-by I shall have the manhood to withhold. 
Virtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception 
than the rule. There is the man and his virtues. Men do 
what is called a good action, as some piece of courage or char- 
ity, much as they would pay a fine in expiation of daily non- 
appearance on parade. ‘Their works are done as an apology 
or extenuation of their living in the world,—as invalidseand 
the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are penances. 
I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is not an apology, 
but a life. It is for itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer 
that it should be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, 
than that it should be glittering and unsteady. I wish it to 
be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding. My 
life should be unique; it should be an alms, a battle, a con- 
quest, a medicine. I ask primary evidence that you are a man, 
and refuse this appeal from the man to his actions. I know 
that for myself it makes no difference whether I do or forbear 
those actions which are reckoned excellent. I cannot consent to 
pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right. Few and mean 
as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own 
assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony. 
What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people 
think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual 
life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness 
and meanness. It is the harder because you will always find 
those who think they know what is your duty better than 
you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world’s 
opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the 
great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with 
perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.

eyes with one or another handkerchief, and attached them- 
selves to some one of these communities of opinion. This 
conformity makes them not false in a few particulars, authors 
of a few lies, but false in all particulars. Their every truth 
is not quite true. Their two is not the real two, their four 
not the real four: so that every word they say chagrins us 
and we know not where to begin to set them right. Meantime 
nature is not slow to equip us in the prison-uniform of the 
party to which we adhere. We come to wear one cut of face 
and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine ex- 
pression. There is a mortifying experience in particular, 
which does not fail to wreak itself also in the general history; 
I mean “the foolish face of praise,” the forced smile which we 
put on in company where we do not feel at ease, in answer 
to conversation which does not interest us. The muscles, 
not spontaneously moved but moved by a low usurping willful- 
ness, grow tight about the outline of the face, and make the 
most disagreeable sensation; a sensation of rebuke and warning 
which no brave young man will suffer twice.

For non-conformity the world whips you with its dis- 
pleasure. And therefore a man must know how to estimate 
a sour face. The bystanders look askance on him in the pub- 
lic street or in the friend’s parlor. If this aversation 
had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own, he might 
well go home with a sad countenance; but the sour faces of 
the multitude, like their sweet faces, hdve no deep cause,— 
disguise no god, but are put on and off as the wind blows and 
a newspaper directs. Yet is the discontent of the multitude 
more formidable than that~of the senate and the college. It 
is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to brook 
the rage of the cultivated classes. Their rage is decorous 
and prudent, for they are timid, as being very vulnerable 
themselves. But when to their feminine rage the indignation 
of the people is added, when the ignorant and the poor are 
aroused, when the unintelligent brute force that lies at. the 
bottom of society is made to growl and mow, it needs the 
habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike as a 
trifle of no concernment. 
The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our con- 
sistency; a reverence for our past act or word because the 
eyes of others have no other date for computing our orbit 
than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them. 
But why should you keep your head over your shoulder? 
Why drag about this monstrous corpse of your memory, lest 
you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public 
place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then? 
It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory 
alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the 
past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live 
ever in a new day. Trust your emotion. In your metaphysics 
you have denied personality to the Deity, yet when the devout 
motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though 
they should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your 
theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.

if you would be a man speak what you think to-day in words as 
hard as cannon balls, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow 
thinks in hard words again, though it contradict everything 
you said to-day. Ah, then, exclaim the aged ladies, you shall 
be sure to be misunderstood! Misunderstood! It is a right 
fool’s word. Is it so. bad then to be misunderstood? Pythag- 
oras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, 
and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure 
and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be mis- 
understood. | 
I suppose no man can violate his nature. All the sallies of 
his will are rounded in by the law of his being, as the inequalities 
of Andes and Himmaleh are significant in the curve of the sphere. 
Nor does it matter how you gauge and try him. A character 
is like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza;—read it forward, back- 
ward, or across, it still spells the same thing. In this pleasing con- 
trite wood-life which God allows me, let me record day by day 
my honest thought without prospect or retrospect, and, I cannot 
doubt, it will be found symmetrical, though I mean it not and 
see it not. My book should smell of pines and resound with the 
hum of insects. The swallow over my window should interweave 
that thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also. We 
pass for what we are. Character teaches above our wills. Men 
imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by 
overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath 
every moment. 
Fear never but you shall be consistent in whatever variety 
of actions, so they be each honest and natural in their hour. 
For of one will, the actions will be harmonious, however unlike 
they seem. These varieties are lost sight of when seen at al 
little distance, at a little height of thought. One tendency, 
unites them all. The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag lin 
of a hundred tacks. This is only microscopic criticism. Se 
the line from a sufficient distance, and it straightens itself t

the average tendency. Your genuine action will explain itself 
and will explain your other genuine actions. Your conformity 
explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have already done 
singly will justify you now. Greatness always appeals to the 
future. If I can be great enough now to do right and scorn 
eyes, I must have done so much right before as to defend me 
now. Beit howit will, do right now. Always scorn appearances 
and you always may. The force of character is cumulative. 
All the foregone days of virtue work their health into this. 
What makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the 
field, which so fills the imagination? The consciousness of a 
train of great days and victories behind. There they all stand 
and shed a united light on the advancing actor. He is attended 
as by a visible escort of angels to every man’s eye. That is it 
which throws thunder into Chatham’s voice, and dignity into 
Washington’s port, and America into Adams’s eye. Honor is 
venerable to us because it is no ephemeris. It is always anciént 
virtue. We worship it to-day because it is not of to-day. We 
love it and pay it homage because it is not a trap for our love 
and homage, but is self-dependent, self-derived, and therefore 
of an old immaculate pedigree, even if shown in a young person. 
I hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity 
and consistency. Let the words be gazetted and ridiculous 
henceforward. Instead of the gong for dinner, let us hear a 
whistle from the Spartan fife. Let us bow and apologize never 
more. A great man is coming to eat at my house. I do not 
wish to please him; I wish that he should wish to please me. I 
will stand here for humanity, and though I would make it kind, 
I would make it true. Let us affront and reprimand the smooth 
mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl in 
the face of custom and trade and office, the fact which is the 
upshot of all history, that there is a great responsible Thinker 
and Actor moving wherever moves a man; that a true man 
belongs to no other time or place, but is the center of things. 
Where he is, there is nature. He measures you and all men and 
all events. You are constrained to accept his standard. Or- 
dinarily, everybody in society reminds us of somewhat else, or
-P-A-G-E-190
  168 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
of some other person. Character, reality, reminds you of noth- 
ing else; it takes place of the whole creation. The man must 
be so much that he must make all circumstances indifferent— 
put all means into the shade. This all great men are and do. 
Every true man is a cause, a country, and an age; requires infinite 
spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his thought ;— 
and posterity seem to follow his steps “ a procession, A man 
Cesar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire. 
Christ is born, and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his 
~genius that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of 
man. An institution is the Teather of one man; as, 
the Reformation, of Luther; Quakerism, of Fox; Methodism, of 
Wesley; Abolition, of Clarkson. Scipio, Milton called “the 
height of Rome;” and all history resolves itself very easily into 
the biography of a few stout and earnest persons. 
Let a man then know his worth, and keep things under his 
feet. Let him not peep or steal, or fet up and down with 
the air of a’charity-boy, a bastard, or an interloper in the world 
which exists for him. But the man in the street, finding no 
worth in himself which corresponds to the force which built a 
tower or sculptured a marble god, feels poor when he looks on 
these. To him a palace, a statue, or a costly book has an alien 
and forbidding air, much like a gay equipage, and seems to 
say like that, ““Who are you, sir?” Yet they all are his, suitors 
for his notice, petitioners to his faculties that they will come out 
and take possession. The picture waits for my verdict; it is 
not to command me, but I am to settle a claim to praise. That 
popular fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the 
street, carried to the duke’s house, washed and dressed and laid 
in the duke’s bed, and, on his waking, treated with all obse- 
quious ceremony like the duke, and assured that he had been 
insane—owes its popularity to the fact that it symbolizes so 
well the state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now 
and then wakes up, exercises his re and finds himself a 
true prince.

lordship, power and estate, are a gaudier vocabulary than private 
John and Edward in a small house and common day’s work: 
but the things of life are the same to both: the sum total of both 
is the same. Why all this deference to Alfred and Scanderbeg 
and Gustavus? Suppose they were virtuous; did they wear out 
virtue? As great a stake depends on your private act to-day as 
followed their public and renowned steps. When private men 
shall act with original views, the luster will be transferred from 
the actions of kings to those of gentlemen. 
The world’ has indeed been instructed by its kings, who 
have so magnetized the eyes of nations. It has been taught 
by this colossal symbol the mutual reverence that is due from 
man to man. The joyful loyalty with which men have every- 
where suffered the king, the noble, or the great proprietor 
to walk among them by a law of his own, make his own scale 
of men and things and reverse theirs, pay for benefits not 
with money but with honor, and represent the Law in his 
person, was the hieroglyphic by which they obscurely signified 
their consciousness of their own right and comeliness, the right 
of every man. 
The magnetism which all original action exerts is explained 
when we inquire the reason of self-trust. Who is the Trustee? 
What is the aboriginal Self, on which a universal reliance 
may be grounded? What is the nature and power of that 
science-baffling star, without parallax, without calculable 
elements, which shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and 
impure actions, if the least mark of independence appear? 
The inquiry leads us to that source, at once the essence of 
genius, the essence of virtue, and the essence of life, which 
we call Spontaneity or Instinct. We denote this primary 
wisdom as Intuition, while all later teachings are tuitions. 
In that deep force, the last fact behind which analysis cannot 
igo, all things find their common origin. For the sense of being 
which in calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is 
ot diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, 
rom man, but one with them and proceedeth obviously from 
ke same source whence their life and being also proceedeth.

We first share the life by which things exist and afterward 
see them as appearances in nature and forget that we have 
shared their cause. Here is the fountain of action and the 
fountain of thought. Here are the lungs of that inspiration 
which giveth man wisdom, of that inspiration of man which 
cannot be denied without impiety and atheism. We lie in 
the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us organs of its 
activity and receivers of its truth. When we discern justice, 
when we discern truth, we do nothing of ourselves, but allow 
a passage to its beams. If we ask whence this comes, if we 
seek to pry into the soul that causés—all metaphysics, all 
philosophy is at fault. Its presence or its absence is all we 
can affirm. Every man discerns between the voluntary acts 
of his mind and his involuntary perceptions. And to his in-

as much as another. All things are dissolved to their center 
by their cause, and in the universal miracle petty and par- 
ticular miracles disappear. This is and must be. If therefore 
a man claims to know and speak of God and carries you back- 
ward to the phraseology of some old moldered nation in an- 
other country, in another world, believe him not. Is the 
acorn better than the oak which is its fullness and completion? 
Is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast 
his ripened being? Whence then this worship of the past? 
The centuries are conspirators against the sanity and majesty 
of the soul.. Time and space are but physiological colors which 
the eye maketh, but the soul is light; where it is, is day; where 
it was, is night; and history is an impertinence and an injury 
if it be any thing more than a cheerful apologue or parable 
of my being and becoming. 
Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he 
dares not say “I think,” “I am,” but quotes some saint or 
sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blow- 
ing rose. These roses under my window make no reference 
to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; 
they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There 
is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. 
Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full- 
blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no 
less. Its nature is satisfied and it satisfies nature in all mo- 
ments alike. There is no time to it. But man postpones 
or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with re- 
verted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that 
surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He 
cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the 
present, above time. 
This should be plain enough. Yet see what strong intel- 
ects dare not yet hear God himself unless he speak the phrase- 
logy of I know not what David, or Jeremiah, or Paul. We 
hall not always set so great a price on a few texts, on a few 
ives. We are like children who repeat by rote the sentences

  of talents and character they chance t see,—painfully .recol- 
lecting the exact words they spoke; afterward, when they 
come into the point of view which those had who uttered 
these sayings, they understand them and are willing to let 
the words go; for at any time they can use words as good 
when occasion comes. So was it with us, so will it be, if we 
proceed. If we live truly, we shall see truly. It is as easy 
for the strong man to be strong, as it is for the weak to be weak. 
When we have new perception, we shall gladly disburden 
the memory of its hoarded treasures as old rubbish. When 
a man lives with God, his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur 
of the brook and the rustle of the corn, 
And now at last the highest truth on this subject remains 
unsaid; probably cannot be said; for all that we say is the 
far off remembering of the intuition: That thought, by what 
I can now nearest approach to say it, is this: When good is 
near you, when you have life in yourself,—it is not by any 
known or appointed way; you shall not discern the foot-prints 
of any other; you shall not see the face of man; you shall not 
hear any name;—the way, the thought, the good, shall be 
wholly strange and new. It shall exclude all other being. 
You take the way from man, not to man. All persons that 
ever existed are its fugitive ministers. There shall be no fear 
in it. Fear and hope are alike beneath it. It asks nothing. 
There is somewhat low even in hope. We are then in vision. 
There is nothing that can be called gratitude, nor properly 
joy. The soul is raised over passion. It seeth identity and 
eternal causation. It is a perceiving that Truth and Right 
are. Hence it becomes a Tranquillity out of the knowing 
that all things go well. Vast spaces of nature; the Atlantic] 
Ocean, the South Sea; vast intervals of time, years, centuries,| 
are of no account. This which I think and feel underlay tha 
former state of life and circumstances, as it does underlie m: 
present and will always all circumstances, and what is calle 
life and what is called death.

TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. Show why a certain degree of independence, and even a touch 
of originality, is essential to a student’s intellectual advancement. 
2. Discuss the student’s attitude toward the authorities he studies. 
Shall it be docile and passive, or critical and independent? Consider, 
in this connection, the following quotation: “How docile young 
people are, after all, in intellectual matters! They lack the courage 
to resent neglect in the class, to acknowledge that they do not under- 
stand, and to ask questions; they lose their initiative and even inde- 
pendent power to think, when in the presence of teachers; and they 
ignore their own experience in favor of print. They are so bent on 
satisfying others that they suppress their inner promptings. In 
doing this they seem to confuse moral with intellectual qualities, 
acting as though the sacrifice of self in study was equally virtuous 
with its sacrifice in a moral way” (McMurray, How to Study, page 
262). 3. Why is individuality so difficult to preserve and develop? 
4. Show how over-conformity injures a man. 5. Contrast the lab- 
oratory method with the text-book method in forming the open 
interrogative mind. 6. Should the college curriculum give more place 
to the forming sciences—bacteriology, psychology, economics, so- 
ciology—than to the well-settled sciences? If so, why? 7. Point 
out some customs of college life to which a student should not con- 
form. 8. What would be Emerson’s position on the question of 
supporting a man for President just because he was the candidate 
of your political party? Should you agree with him in his position? 
9. Does Emerson’s definition of genius express your idea? Compare 
it with the following: ‘Genius is mainly an affair of energy” (Matthew 
Arnold); “Genius is nothing but a great capacity for patience” 
(Buffon); “Genius is nothing but labor and diligence’? (Hogarth); 
“Genius is the power of carrying the feelings of childhood into the 
powers of manhood” (Coleridge). 10. “An institution is but the 
lengthened shadow of one man” (page 168). Give illustrations. 
11. Select from this essay some apothegm such as “A foolish consist- 
ency of the hobgoblin of little minds,” and show whether it squares 
with your own observation.

THE MIND OF THE UNDERGRADUATE # 
GrorGE PIERCE BAKER 
[George Pierce Baker (1866: ) is professor of dramatic art in Harvard 
University. Before becoming interested in the teaching of play writing, 
Professor Baker was a pioneer in the teaching of argumentation in colleges. 
In connection with the severe demands of argumentative composition, he had 
ample opportunity to form an opinion regarding the mental caliber of stu- 
dents. This opinion he gives in the following selection, which was originally a 
paper read before the Schoolmasters’ Association of New York and vicinity.]     
                           
    
   
         
      
    
       
I wish to state certain conditions which I find in the minds 
of Harvard undergraduates as some one hundred and fifty of 
them come before me, year after year, in the various courses 
on argumentation and public address which it is my fortune 
to have in charge. Whenever I consider the states of mind 
which confront me in these courses, certain queries and prob- 
lems instantly arise. Understand, please, that what I am saying 
this morning I am not saying about the brilliant undergraduate, 
nor about the dull undergraduate. I am talking about the rank 
and file of the undergraduate body as it comes before me. I 
am talking, too, about youths who are not Sophomores, but 
Juniors and Seniors, and sometimes ies Graduate Students; 
that is, the maturer of our college men. It is becoming clear, 
to our undergraduate that he had better keep out of the de- 
bating, certainly out of the higher forms of debating work, until 
he, or somebody else, recognizes that he is somewhat matured. 
As I work, year by year, with these youths, there is a sen- 
tence which keeps recurring to me with renewed significance, 
It is: “Now and then be idle; sit and think.” Unless yo 
have recently been reading in the eighteenth-century literature, 
I doubt if you will associate that with the right person. I 
doesn’t sound like the meteoric career and the varied activitie: 
of Richard Brinsley Sheridan; but he : the man who wrote it. 
I should like to see that verse written large somewhere upo 
the walls of Harvard College, because as I work with thes 
undergraduates I am more and more surprised to find, not tha

     they do not know how to think accurately, cogently (I suppose 
they would not be in classes in argumentation if they knew 
how to think well), but that many of them have no real interest 
in knowing how to think well. Many of them mean to enter 
the Law School and therefore wish training in debate. Many 
suspect that some day they will have to speak often in public 
and wish the requisite training. Far too many of both groups 
desire the end but care nothing for the means, the process by 
which it may best be attained. It is only by forcing, coaxing, 
that one can develop in these youths any interest in thinking 
for thinking’s own sake, can make them appreciate the fact that 
there is a delicate pleasure in the process of thinking. I meet 
often the type—which you must all know perfectly well, only 
he is a little more mature with me and therefore, I suppose, 
a little less pliable—who sits in front of you with an amiably re- 
ceptive expression, who smiles gently at all your neat turns of 
phrase, who gives you a feeling that, on the whole, your lecture 
is really well fitted to the needs of the class, and then comes 
to the desk to ask you just one question which shows his mind 
has not taken in one important idea from the entire hour. Not 
only that; sometimes, and here is where his real genius comes 
in, he shows you that (despite his receptive appearance through- 
out your lectures) he has not taken in anything new for two 
or three weeks. It sometimes seems to me that the under- 
graduate of this type approaches more nearly to the delicious 
state of Nirvana than anybody outside of the East, perhaps 
than anybody in the East: his mind is not somewhere else, but 
simply nowhere; it is taking an absolute rest. What makes 
this Buddhist of the West especially difficult to deal with is 
that he is not boorish or inconsiderate toward the instructor, 
but usually quite the opposite. Clad in intellectual oilskins, 
he is almost blithesome in his absolute imperviousness to the 
ideas for which he is supposed to be taking the course. 
There is another closely related group, those who, when 
choosing a question for a forensic or debate, instantly balk 
when I say: “I think we have had enough of the Panama 
Canal, the control of Manchuria, and the Merger Case; let us 
   
-P-A-G-E-198

try something now that will really test you, let us try-a question 
of college life.” They don’t want it at all, and they don’t 
take it unless I insist. I have been asked just once in three 
years to approve a question on a college matter. When asked, 
I was quite overwhelmed and immensely encouraged. That is 
to say, then, if I suggest to the undergraduate that he take this 
question, which is of vital moment to us at Harvard at the pres- 
ent day: Is the new plan for assigning rooms in the Yard likely 
to draw the representative men to the Yard? that is, Are we 
likely to succeed in endeavoring to get back in the Yard the 
representative men and the larger body of students? he does not 
take it unless I force him. In that case, he works over it for a 
while and finally comes to tell me that he is very sorry but he 
must change the question: there is no evidence at all to be 
found on it, he says. When I suggest that I have supposed his 
mind is his own kingdom, and that he, surely, can discuss the 
question inasmuch as he applied for a room under this plan 
and is by choice, supposedly, living inside rather than outside 
the Yard, he says: “Well, you know there is nothing written 
upon this subject at all; I’ve got to spin it all out of my own 
head! I can’t do that.” That happens over and over again. A 
year or two ago we were discussing the question: Shall we en- 
force training in the gymnasium for the Freshmen? When I 
talked with Juniors and Seniors who certainly had all been 
Freshmen, some of them Freshmen who had carefully and 
conscientiously done work in the gymnasium, urging them ta 
take that question, they at first said they knew absolutely 
nothing about it. They could tell me how they had exercised 
when they had exercised, but as for getting their experience int« 
any relationship with undergraduate life in general, or looking 
at the question from the point of view of another undergraduate, 
that seemed to them quite impossible. This means that among 
undergraduates there is a curious lack of correct information 
about current topics in college life, and particularly about the 
relation of undergraduate life to the larger interests of the 
University. Often a student comes to me in an intense state 
of enthusiasm over some scheme regarding a college organiza-
-P-A-G-E-199
  
INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 177 
tion: after listening to it, I point out that it seems admirable, 
but that four years before we tried identically that scheme— 
which failed dismally, for reasons which still hold good. He 
had never heard of all this, though any investigation of the 
history of his organization would have given him the informa- 
tion. He has simply developed his own scheme for the imme- 
diate moment, with no look backward and no thought forward. 
Recently I asked some of my students to note simply in 
three hundred words, exactly why the writer was rooming 
inside or outside the Yard, that I might see whether the class 
could put the matter clearly in that compass. The exercise 
was very well done indeed. Then LT said: ‘Now suppose you 
are writing to a friend whom you wish to induce to room with 
you either inside or outside the Yard. Take some real person 
whose peculiarities and habits you know well. So present your 
reasons that they shall have persuasive value for that individual 
just because he is himself and not another person.” Result: a 
dire failure. Most of those exercises were simply repetitions 
of letter number one. A few were very gentle attempts at the 
art of persuasion. The majority gave a reader no suggestion 
of the personality addressed. These illustrations show, it 
seems to me, not only no pleasure at all in thinking as thinking, 
but almost an unwillingness to think. When I point out to such 
students that some clear statement of their ideas is all very well, 
but that I don’t see why I should accept their views since other 
unanswered ideas occur to me, they too often seem to regard 
me as a little contrary, a little misinformed, uninformed per- 
haps—very rarely with a suspicion that I may be a little more 
informed. After all, the state of mind of the undergraduate 
beginning this matter of argumentation always reminds me 
of those lines on old Daniel Hanks down on Cape Cod. 
“Some fellows reckon, more or less, 
Before they speak their mind, 
And sometimes calculate or guess, 
But they ain’t Daniel’s kind. 
Says I: ‘How do you know you're right?’ 
“How do I know?’ says he; 
‘Well now, I vum, I know by gum 
T’m right, because I be,’ ”
-P-A-G-E-200
178 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
When I ask these students to look at the ideas, if possible, 
from the other person’s side, not that they must necessarily go 
over to the other man’s position, but just to see if they can 
imagine what the other man might think on the subject, they 
can’t do it. Only after long training can they see the idea in 
more than one way. Yet in the whole field of persuasion cer- 
tainly one of the great demands upon public speakers is so to 
present an idea that it shall seem true to the other person, not 
simply because of the truth of the idea, but because of the 
method of presentation. How can they do that, if they can’t 
begin to imagine what the other man is likely to think about 
any particular subject? 
This lack of co-operation between the imagination and thought 
is illustrated over and over again in our undergraduate life. 
At the preliminary Boylston Prize speaking, which we have in 
Cambridge every spring, it has often been difficult to distinguish 
between selections from George William Curtis, Demosthenes, 
and Mr. Bryan. One listens four hours to thirty or forty young 
men doing admirably just this: reading, rather than speaking, 
their selections so that the meaning is perfectly clear, but so that 
neither the special qualities of the style nor the special conditions 
for which the speech was prepared are equally clear. The result 
is that these men’s speeches are almost exactly alike. When 
perhaps you suggest to one of the young men the desirability 
of recalling that when George William Curtis delivered his ad- 
dress in New York on “The Puritan Principle: Liberty under 
the Law,” excitement over the Hayes-Tilden controversy was 
at fever heat and that Mr. Curtis, fitting his speech to the needs 
of the occasion, poured oil on the troubled waters, the student 
looks at you puzzled. He has learned his lines. He delivers 
them in his own way. What more can you ask? The few to 
whom this criticism does not apply so stand out from their 
competitors that they are sure to appear in the list of those 
chosen for the final contest. 
These conditions have some interesting results in under- 
graduate life. Ido not know how much you may have read the 
undergraduate editorial. It is not to be recommended unless you
-P-A-G-E-201
  
INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 179 
have plenty of time. I have read a great many and they almost 
all fall into one of two classes. They are either wonderfully 
non-committal, balanced so delicately that the editor can fall 
either way with rapidity as college sentiment moves one way or 
the other; or else are a skillful clouding of a very slight idea in 
a mist of words. Once in a while a man comes forward who has 
the editorial instinct. Giving himself some trouble, he writes 
editorials that say something, either summarizing existing con- 
ditions so that you are thoroughly informed, or summarizing 
and commenting at the same time. Very rarely, some of these 
men write an editorial which states an opinion, and maintains it 
clearly, perhaps leading off in a movement. Is it too much to 
ask sometimes for the last kind of editorial? It might be if I 
did not know most of these editors to be personally intelligent, 
alert and responsive, assiduous in gathering news, alive to the 
changes of undergraduate life. Yet when it comes toa signifi- 
cant editorial statement from them you look almost in vain. 
These men seem to have no interest in relating the particular 
phenomena of the movement to what has gone before or to 
the conditions that are likely to come. So, too, it is with the 
undergraduate applying, under the new plan, for a room in the 
Yard. He has a paper to sign which states the new plan. He 
reads, signs, and that is the end of the work for him. Considera- 
tion of the new policy as likely to lead to different conditions 
in undergraduate life, as likely to make the undergraduate life 
of his successor somewhat different from his own, any consider- 
ation perhaps whether his own college life has been pleasanter 
because he has roomed where he has—there is little of that kind 
of thinking in the college papers. It is done, if at all, by a few 
thoughtful men,—who are not always, in their college days, the 
most prominent men. 
There is another curious manifestation of this neglect of 
thinking. One great difficulty which I find in my teaching is the 
restless activity of the undergraduate. Some of the best men, 
who really might do admirable work in their courses and win 
distinction in their undergraduate career, don’t get these results 
simply because they are like a student of mine in recent years,
-P-A-G-E-202
  180 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
always so busy with the other thing that the immediate piece 
of work never was done properly. That is the most common 
difficulty in undergraduate work; of course we know the excuse 
for it. It is, that these are young people. They are; but they 
are getting older, and I take it that, in so far as age means judg- 
ment, discretion, we are here in these colleges largely to assist 
in making these youths somewhat older. I see no reason why 
they should not begin this training early in their college career. 
Instead they plunge into every kind of activity. When I meet 
an undergraduate who is able to say: “These things I will do, 
and these things I will put aside,” I know that man is going to 
rise. I have seen him rise, year after year, and college genera- 
tion after college generation. The past students whom I take 
most pride in are those who were beginning to be able to make 
this thoughtful choice even in their college days. The majority 
of undergraduates cannot do it at all. They think themselves 
vitally interested in a special subject they are studying, and get 
small results in it. Certainly some of them say often enough 
there is no subject in which they are so much interested as 
debating and the practice of public address, and that they mean 
to do the very best possible work, yet they prove ineffective in 
the courses. One student, for instance, says: “I am taking 
the history of economics in order that my work may be better 
in this debating.” I put him on an early debate and his con- 
tribution is the thinnest imaginable. Nor has he in the least 
meant to deceive me. Not at all. Investigating, I find he 
is president of one club, secretary of another; belongs to ten 
different organizations, and has accepted an office in every one. 
He has so many things to do that he cannot possibly do any of 
them well. Even while he is taking a course in debating he 
belongs to his own class debating club, which debates weekly 
and depends for its interest upon the activity of four or five 
men. He is one of the officers of the Debating Union which 
embraces all the undergraduate debating clubs. He is full of 
schemes for the improvement of Harvard debating. Here, then, 
is a man of A capacity, who is able to obtain a grade of B, if 
he simply does nothing but follow his own natural bent, who
-P-A-G-E-203
  
INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 181 
barely gets his B, because he comes to me with poorly prepared 
debates, over which he grieves greatly two hours after the fiasco 
is passed. Has not lack of thought something to do with that? 
How can the undergraduate who thinks about the possibilities 
of his undergraduate career, realizing what his chances are, fail 
to see that to behave in this way is to lose just the special 
chances for which he would once have told you he was coming to 
college? I don’t care, in the least, whether he settles down upon 
his philosophical club, his musical organization, debating or 
something else, if he will only settle down, concentrating upon 
something; then we shall be able to get results from him. This 
mental dissipation, this American hustle, which keeps interested 
in everything with small, because scattered, results, is a very 
unsatisfactory feature of the undergraduate world of to-day. 
I do not contend for a moment that some of the under- 
graduates in the colleges I know do not understand thoroughly 
how to fulfill the first half of Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s sen- 
tence: “Now and then be idle.” But to sit apart and think 
is the troublesome operation. Watch them in their reading; 
watch them attending the theaters; you will find them reading 
mainly the books of ephemeral popularity, books they can skim, 
and attending musical burlesque, melodrama, vaudeville. 
Negation of thought is a science with this group. You face an 
interesting social question. We are developing curious citizens, 
unless we can, in some way, arouse these men to more responsi- 
bility. Now, it is quite fair to say, of course, that the awakening 
comes in many cases as graduate students and in the graduate 
school of life. I think it is perhaps a question with all of us 
teachers whether that is not a slightly late awakening. I never 
can fully share in the joy of the friends of a young man who 
has wasted most of his college time, when they say: “He is 
working hard, I assure you, in the Law School,’’ as if somehow 
that were a satisfactory solution for everything. Does that 
recovery fully offset all the wasted opportunities of his college 
life? 
There is another way in which this unwillingness to think 
works out. The growth of the tutorial system in this country 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
    
182 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
is both interesting and a little alarming. A father said to me, 
recently: ‘How is it that when I went to school (a 
preparatory school), it was not at all necessary that I should 
have a tutor every summer in order to get into Harvard College, 
nor necessary for my friends either? But my boy has to havea 
tutor. He is as bright as I was, and the other boys are bright— 
yet they all have tutors. What is the matter?” Of course we 
know what the fathers want to do—they want to hold you and 
me responsible. But first of all the boy is responsible; he wants 
to get his results as far as possible without thinking; at least he 
wishes somebody else to stand-over him to see that he does. 
As a result we have this curious development at our colleges— 
the tutor who drags his young men along until he drags them 
through. The ethics of this custom need not be discussed here, 
but surely it is self-evident that such tutelage cannot be desir- 
able. 
Nor do I believe that this general attitude of mind among 
undergraduates is temporary. When I have sometimes spoken 
about these matters to graduates, of course they have said: 
“You must not take the situation too seriously. Boys will be 
boys. We have had numerous curious phases of undergraduate 
life. You must remember, when you were in college, what was 
known as ‘Harvard indifference.’ It was a peculiar kind of 
pose that held the stage for a time. That is true; it was tem- 
porary. It was a pose, something superimposed. We did 
it; we knew all the time we were doing it, and we had a good 
deal of fun out of it. But, watching this lack of pleasure in 
thinking, I don’t think it is superimposed but exceedingly basal. 
No choice whatever is involved in it. It is the state of mind in 
which these youths come to college. Often a student says: 
“That was an interesting principle you explained at the last 
lecture and I should like to carry it out in my work.” ‘Why 
don’t you? If it is good for anything, it is applicable for 
you.” He answers: “I tried to carry it out the other day, 
but somehow I couldn’t see how it fits into my work.” Surely 
if he can’t learn in his college days to make the application of 
general principles to his own needs, if you must stand over him,  
-P-A-G-E-205
  INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 183 
explaining, coaxing, aiding, he will have an odd time with the 
outside world where task-masters are more plentiful than teach- 
ers—or tutors. If this were the state of one, two, or ten under- 
graduates, it would not be important; but when there is a large 
group, and I believe an increasing group, of this sort, it is time 
to ask the source of this weakness. I am clear in my own mind 
that back of the responsibility of the boy lies the responsibility 
of the college, school, and home. 
It is rather hard on a boy to plunge him into such a maze of 
possibilities as the Harvard elective pamphlet. I have some- 
times wondered that the Freshman bears everything as bravely 
ashe does. Of course he wants to take everything, all the higher 
mathematics courses before he has completed the initial courses, 
the most advanced Latin courses before he has finished Cesar, 
all the courses in Anglo-Saxon before he has even a rudimentary 
knowledge of English Literature. Although he is not permitted 
to do this, it is one of the weaknesses of the Elective System— 
everything that is wrong has its weaknesses—that it seems to 
suggest variety and not solidity as of first importance in educa- 
tion, so that youth deduces as a corollary that variety is not 
only the spice of college life but the great essential. That 
may in part lead to the dissipation of energies of which I have 
spoken—wasteful, dangerous. The big lecture courses are 
enervating for the student. They are, for the teacher, the 
toughest problem he has to face. Given three or four hundred 
young men so crowded into a room where the temperature is so 
high that the air grows close before the hour is half over; given 
a subject necessarily a little hard to grasp; given an instructor 
who speaks in a voice not audible for all, or with adry, uninterest- 
ing manner, and such conditions are a forcing house for that 
look of apparent attention which really marks vacuity of mind. 
But would so many develop so rapidly this indifference to 
thinking if other causes had not prepared the way, before col- 
lege days? I sometimes wonder, and that is one reason I am 
here this morning, whether it is possible that the colleges 
have set such rigid standards for the various entrance ex- 
aminations that the schools must give all their time to cram- 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  184 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
ming the boys for them, and cannot teach them to see the 
relation or bearing of one subject upon another. If, instead, 
the boy came up to college with fewer facts, but.an interest 
in thinking for its own sake, respect for learning and literature, 
and some responsibility in citizenship, would not the gain be 
great? The schools now send him up with his mind like a 
desk with pigeon-holes, some of them perhaps a trifle dusty, 
but undoubtedly with contents, yet not as a human being 
who has a relation to learning, literature, and the facts of 
existence, and who is able and eager to make for himself appli- 
cations of the ideas he has learned. Whatever may be the cause, 
I believe that our secondary education at present spends too 
much time on facts as facts, far too little on creating an atti- 
tude of mind toward life and learning. Surely when one sees 
large numbers of our boys and girls alike rushing nervously from 
activity to activity; unable or unwilling to think quietly about 
the ideas taught them, or what they see about them, avid of 
ephemeral but strong sensation and superficial information, 
all is not well. One may spoil a child’s mind even as one may 
spoil a child’s digestion. The appetite for food and the appetite 
for information are much alike in the normal child. Each is in- 
sistent, will be fed, and takes what is given as it is given. The 
normal child has its keen interests and will absorb anything 
which bears on them. If he is interested in birds, you will 
find him in his enthusiasm reading the Latin names or scien- 
tific descriptions of them long before he can properly pro- 
nounce the Latin or understand the long technical terms. 
But in other subjects his interest may be only languid. It is 
dangerously easy to let this languor, which means ultimate 
superficiality, pass over even into what was once a subject so 
absorbing that it, at least, meant thoroughness. Some of our 
present-day so-called aids to study—certain conditions per- 
mitted, or at least not counteracted, in secondary schools, 
such as the rapid increase in tutoring to piece out the school 
work—are insidious. 
Of course one must admit that in any case the secondary 
school is between the upper millstone of the rigid and severe 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
  
‘ 
INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 185 
college requirements and the nether millstone of the irresponsible 
home. It is amusing to hear occasional lamentation that to-day 
we Americans do not read with enjoyment the contemplative 
poetry of the eighteenth century—‘‘The Pleasure of Hope,” 
“The Pleasures of Memory,” etc. What has the American, 
who cannot utter the word hustle without affectionate stress 
upon its syllables as a word created by his people to describe 
a quality which they assume to be an American monopoly, 
to do with such poetry? Much to-day in American business 
life and, consequently, in its social life is but superficiality 
and sham concealed in a dust-storm of innumerable activities. 
Business and social responsibilities make it impossible for 
many parents, we are told, to train their children, and they 
are left to the schools, tutors, and themselves. Moreover, all 
this hustle is self-conscious, childlike. It thrives on living in the 
eye of the public, it is satisfied only with constant, evident 
results of its activity which the public will surely acclaim. 
Consequently we are only beginning to value properly the life 
of the scholar. Not long ago an American, after some years 
of study abroad, returned with his family to one of our cities 
most priding itself on its “culture.” He tried to devote him- 
self to historical research preparatory to a book, and yet to 
see something of society. After a winter he told me he was 
going abroad again. He and his family were tired of the in- 
sistent: “What are you doing? Oh, writing! A_ history? 
Really! When will it be out?” The combination of restrained 
incredulity that a man financially able to do what he pleased 
with his life should devote it to scholarship, and of demand 
for the instant results from his work, was too much for him. 
I believe, then, that the causes for this heedlessness in 
undergraduates lie back of college and school, in the home, 
in the very nature of maturer American life of to-day. Whether 
we can get at the conditions in the home, or not, we certainly 
can in the school and college. But first we must recognize 
the. condition and our present failure to grapple with it. Grant 
all the force exerted by the upper and nether millstones, is the 
secondary school resisting as stoutly as it might? That is
-P-A-G-E-208
  
186 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
worthy of serious consideration. Is there not danger that, in 
much of the higher education, we teachers are like the builders 
fitting marble plates to stucco walls or him who makes bricks 
without straw? 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. Give from your own experience instances to show the deficiencies 
of college students as thinkers. 2. Show the importance of the cul- 
tivation of the power to think by commenting on this saying, “ Knowl- 
edge represents the storehouse; thinking is the engine that fills it.” 
3. Discuss, ‘‘ Thinking and study are intimately related. All studying 
represents, or should represent, thinking: but thinking may not rep- 
resent studying.” 4. What studies of the college curriculum tend 
by their inherent character to develop the power of thinking? 
5. Discuss the choice of debate questions in your institution. Are they 
of the kind to compel students to do first-hand thinking? 6. Criticise 
the editorials in your college paper or magazine. Suggest subjects 
that your college publications might take up with advantage; pos- 
sibly write a model editorial yourself. 7. Other reasons, than those 
given by Professor Baker, for the decline in the ability to think 
among college students may be the prevalence of the lecture system 
of instruction, the increasing luxuriousness of college life, the pre- 
dominating interest in athletics, the presence of many students in 
our colleges who do not look forward to the learned professions, but 
to commercial and industrial careers, etc. Discuss the effects of 
all, or some of these causes. Perhaps you can suggest other causes. 
7. Describe the sort of use of the college library that may make it 
injurious to a student’s powers of thought, and by way of contrast 
show how the library may properly be used.

body of college students to-day. Every one complains in his 
heart, although in public he is apt to declare that the condi- 
tions in his own college are better than they are elsewhere. 
In fact, we know little enough about the state of affairs in our 
own institutions, and are quite in the dark when we presume 
to draw comparisons with other places. This is a case where 
measuring ourselves by ourselves, and comparing ourselves 
among ourselves, is not wise. In spite of divergences in de- 
tail, the problem is essentially the same everywhere, and any 
college that helps to solve it will confer a benefit upon the 
whole country. Nor is it enough if we are better than our 
fathers were, if the average amount of study in college is greater, 
and the minimum much greater, than it was. In the com- 
munity at large the general activity has increased prodigiously; 
even elegant indolence is by no means so fashionable as it used 
to be. Our colleges ought, in a movement of this kind, to 
set the, pace, not follow it; and they must not rest satisfied 
until they create among their students a high standard of 
achievement. 
When the elective system was first introduced, its advocates 
believed that it would have a powerful selective influence, by 
offering to each student ampler opportunity for self-development 
in the branches of learning that he might prefer. The opponents 
of the system did not deny this, but complained that the 
undergraduate was not capable of judging what was best for 
him, and that to follow his own bent would lead to a one-sided 
development. In the plans of men, the indirect, and therefore 
unforeseen, consequences are often more important than those 
which form the subject of discussion. The elective system— 
which has to a greater or less extent penetrated almost all 
our colleges—did, indeed, furnish an opportunity for self- 
development; but at the same time it weakened the stimulus to 
exertion. It was based upon the assumption that oppor- 
tunity alone is enough, that a man will put-forth his utmost 
powers if he can do so in a congenial field. Yet this is by 
no means true, even in the case of the highest genius. Many 
a man of talent has worked only from the stress of pov-     
   
                 
       
-P-A-G-E-210
    188 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
erty, groaning all the time at his hard fate. Shakespeare him- 
self did much of his writing under the pressure of finishing 
plays for the stage; and the difficulty of keeping artists and 
literary men up to time is notorious,—a difficulty not wholly 
due to the fitful inspiration of the muse. 
If opportunity alone were enough, hereditary wealth, which 
vastly enlarges opportunity, ought to increase intellectual 
productiveness. There ought to be no place “where wealth 
accumulates and men decay.’”’ But there is too much truth 
in the common belief that abundant means usually lessens 
the output of creative work; and even Shakespeare, when 
rich enough to retire as a country gentleman, wrote no more. 
The mere opportunity for self-development, and for the free 
exercise of one’s faculties, the mere desire for self-expression, 
are not enough with most men to bring out all their latent 
powers. This is because in civilized life we are seeking to 
foster an activity far above the normal; we are striving to 
evoke a mental energy much greater than that required for a 
bare subsistence, and unless education can effect this it is a 
failure. In addition to opportunity, there must be a stimulus 
of some kind. 
Under the old rigid curriculum the stimulus was supplied 
in part by competition. Since all the students were follow- 
ing the same course they were naturally ranked by their marks, 
and there was. no little emulation among the more ambitious 
ones. Rivalry, with its component elements, the desire to win 
and the still stronger desire not to be beaten, is a pervasive 
sentiment in human nature, often most prominent when the 
object itself is least worth striving for. It is constantly shown 
in trivial things, from the school-boy who quickens his pace 
when a stranger walks faster than he, to the countryman who 
hates to have his horse passed on the road. The intensity 
of the emulation depends, in fact, far less upon the value of 
the end to be attained, than‘ upon the ease with which the 
chances of the contestants are compared; provided, of course, 
they are nearly enough matched to make the result uncertain,|

track is obviously more exciting than one in which they start 
at considerable intervals, or run over different roads out of 
sight of one another. That is the c

thousand people cannot go to a football game, and become 
greatly excited over it, without being convinced that the 
victory is in itself a highly important matter. Thus competi- 
tion provokes rivalry, intense rivalry gives rise to a keen in- 
terest, and this in turn enhances the apparent value of the 
object for which the contest is waged. It is one of many in- 
stances where a state of mind is produced by stimulating the 
secondary emotions to which it naturally gives birth. 
_-But the free elective system in college has reduced the spirit 
of competition in scholarship to a minimum. Perhaps no 
two men are taking precisely the same series of courses, and 
hence their achievements are incommensurate. Like the 
Caucus Race in Alice in Wonderland, every one begins and 
ends where he pleases, save that he must take at least a cer- 
tain number of courses; and, as on that famous occasion, 
little interest is taken in the distribution of prizes. But it 
is the fashion to say that young men of college age ought 
not to work for prizes, or rank. This, we are told, is a low 
motive; and a man ought to study for the knowledge, the 
training, and the culture he acquires. In short, he ought not 
to need the spur of competition, or any other external stim- 
ulus, because it ought to be enough for him that his future 
welfare is in his own hands, and his own best interests ought 
to guide him in the way he cibuld go. But such an assump- 
tion leads to a rather startling conclusion; for if the ordinary 
undergraduate can be trusted to act most wisely of his own 
accord, if his natural impulses are correct, then his attitude

190 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
toward his studies is what it should be. If he has less respect 
for scholarship than one might wish, nevertheless under this 
assumption he is right, while we who disagree with him must 
be wrong. 
It may be that the need of competition or other stimulus to 
exertion among undergraduates depends upon the position 
which the college occupies in the general scheme of education, 
and upon the intricate functions of play and work in building 
up the faculties of mind and body. If so, it may be worth 
while to consider these questions briefly. 
Of late years we have been taught much about the value 
of play in the development both of animals and of man; and 
for that purpose the word is commonly used to denote those 
acts which are performed for mere pleasure without any other 
serious motive.! Now I am perfectly aware of the iniquity of 
employing a technical term in an unusual sense; and yet on 
this occasion I propose, contrary to usage, to define play as 
any action of which the physiological object is a development 
of the powers of the actor, as distinguished from the accom- 
plishment of a result in itself useful, or the acquisition of the 
means for reaching such a result. This seems a more apt 
definition in connection with education, because thereby atten- 
tion is fixed on the physiological and educational object, not 
on the personal motive of the actor. To illustrate what is 
meant, let us look at the case of the over-studious boy, who is 
compelled to coast or ride when he does not want to do so, 
and does not enjoy it. We say that he is obliged to play, 
but that is a contradiction in terms if play means only things 
done for pleasure. Again, if pleasure is the criterion, and a stu- 
dent takes, because he enjoys it, an additional course beyond 
the number required by the curriculum, it must be classed for 
him as play; while for the student next him, who is taking 
only the prescribed number of courses, it is not play. If, on the 
other hand, he is a member of an athletic team, not for the 
mere fun of it, but because he thinks it good for him, or be-

INTELLECTUAL IDEALS Igl 
cause he hopes that he can help his college to win the game, 
then again it is not play; and as we shall see hereafter, a large 
part of the physical sports of youth are in fact pursued from 
motives other than mere pleasure. 
A pursuit, then, which is followed, whether voluntarily or by 
compulsion, because it tends to develop the mind or body, is 
play; while one that is followed for the sake of gain, or because 
it supplies the manual skill or technical knowledge needed to 
earn bread, is not play. The application of the definition to 
studies is clearly shown in the varying relations between general 
education and professional training. In American schools for 
engineers it has been common to intersperse a certain amount of 
general education among the technical courses. But in the 
schools of divinity, law, and medicine it has been the tradition 
to confine the teaching to strictly professional matters. Con- 
versely, the American college of the older type was devoted 
entirely to studies that were deemed to be of general educational 
value, without having any direct professional bearing. So far 
as this object has been retained, and for the most part it still 
holds its ground, the college may be regarded as the last period 
of play. Do not misunderstand me. By play I do not mean 
anything trivial, unessential, or even necessarily pleasurable. I 
refer to pursuits which develop the mental, physical, and moral 
powers, as distinguished from the acquisition of directly profit- 
able attainments. While anyone may quarrel with this use of 
the word “play,” the thing itself is intensely serious. It is the 
chief occupation of the most formative part of life, and should 
therefore be taken in a spirit of earnest determination. 
For class-room purposes this is, no doubt, the well-worn dis- 
tinction between liberal or cultural studies on one side, and pro- 
fessional or vocational ones on the other; but it is wider, inas- 
much as it includes outdoor sports, and that is the reason I 
use it. The object, for example, of athletics in college is physical 
development, yet if a member of a baseball nine were paid for 
his services, or if he joined it in order to fit himself to become a 
professional hereafter, for him it would not be play. Now, I 
elieve that there is a close analogy between outdoor sports and 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
    
192. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
those indoor studies which are pursued for intellectual develop- 
ment, especially in regard to the question of stimulus by com- 
petition. 
According to the usual definition of play, as an action in itself 
pleasurable and pursued from that motive alone, any other 
stimulus is obviously unnecessary. But after early infancy 
that is not quite true of what we commonly understand by play. 
With very young children mere delight in exercising nascent 
faculties may be enough to provoke all the activity needed to 
develop those faculties, but that condition is soon outgrown. 
With most animals, indeed, the struggle for existence begins so 
early that the development by play covers only a brief time of 
rapid growth in which pleasure may be a sufficient incentive. 
Man, however, goes through a long period of adolescence before 
he is self-supporting, and with the progress of civilization it 
seems destined to become longer and longer, at least for pursuits 
that require intellectual labor. During a very small part of 
this period can we trust to the propelling force of enjoyment 
alone, even for the training of the physical powers. The mere 
pleasure of exercise soon ceases to suffice, because muscular 
strength and nervous and moral force can be brought to a high 
point only by strenuous exertion that surpass the bounds of 
strict physical enjoyment. To make the most of himself the 
boy must be induced to put forth an uncomfortable effort, and 
for this he must have an external stimulus of some kind. No 
one who knows much about intercollegiate football believes that 
most of the men are on the team chiefly because the game itself 
is pleasurable; and, in fact, other motives than immediate 
pleasure enter largely into all violent competitive sports after 
an early period of childhood. It is safe to assert that if young 
people took part in games only so far as they enjoyed the exercise, 
without being affected by ambition or the opinion of their fellows, 
a large portion of the more strenuous sports, and therewith 
much valuable training, physical and moral, would be lost. 
The stimulus needed is usually found in competition; and, in 
fact, the object of throwing a boy into contact with others of 
his own age is, not only to train his social instincts, but also to
-P-A-G-E-215
  INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 193 
bring him into rivalry with his mates, to make him play with 
them games which test his powers, and stimulate him to use 
them to the full. Within the range of their immediate interests, 
young people are good practical psychologists, from whom we 
have still much to learn by studying the way they organize their 
sports to provoke exertion or select superior capacity; and it may 
be observed that competition in sport becomes more intense as 
maturity is approached. No doubt competition is often carried 
too far, until it has the effect of eliminating from the arena all 
but a few champions of preéminent qualities. In his Social 
Life in Greece, Professor Mahaffy pointed out the advantage to 
the community of the field sports of Sparta, in which every one 
of ordinary strength could engage, as compared with the gym- 
nastic games of Athens, where only remarkable athletes took 
part and the rest of the young men looked on. Athletic sports 
in our colleges involve the same danger, by tending to accentuate 
the selective principle at the expense of the physical improve- 
ment of the whole body of students. But the fact that com- 
petition may be carried further than is wise does not prove that 
it is not valuable as a stimulus, that it is not indeed the main fac- - 
tor in the physical development of youth. 
There is certainly no less need for an effective stimulus in 
scholarly than in physical training, but it is far more difficult to 
use, because we cannot at present rely on the same constant 
enthusiasm on the part of the young people themselves. In the 
professional schools this matter is in a satisfactory state to-day. 
Fifty years ago there appears to have been no little apathy 
about study in these schools, but they have now succeeded 
generally in convincing their students that excellence in the 
work of the school has great importance, both as an equipment 
for their coming career, and as an indication of future success. 
In some cases competition is indeed used with marked effect, 
but it is not indispensable, because the student has the powerful 
incentive of feeling that he has begun his life’s work, in which 
his prospects depend on his diligence. The schools for engineers 
where general and technical subjects are taught side by side, 
bring into sharp contrast the strong professional motive and 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
194 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
the feebler desire for self-improvement. It is difficult there to 
make the ordinary student realize the value of a cultural 
course. He is apt to regard it as something foreign to his 
regular work; something very well in its way, but not essential 
to success in his future career. He labors without a groan on 
mathematics, which most college undergraduates shun like a 
pestilence, while he treats English literature or the history of 
his country lightly, as a pleasant enough accomplishment hardly 
worthy of strenuous effort. 
At the other end of the educational ladder, also, in the prepar- 
atory school, competition, although highly useful, is not indis- 
pensable. The boy is subject to discipline, accustomed to obey, 
and much influenced by the precepts and wishes of his parents 
and teachers. Ifa good boy, he tries to do well, and being under 
constant supervision he tends to conform to the expectations 
of those about him. The serious difficulty begins in college, 
where he is plunged into a far wider liberty—a freedom that 
brings vast opportunities, intellectual and moral, by which he 
may rise, but which on the other hand he may abuse. The old 
schoolboy motives for hard study he has left behind; the pro- 
fessional ones are not yet in sight; and it is not easy to make him 
appreciate the seriousness of the education within his reach. 
To some extent he believes that it is good for him, and he intends 
to obtain a real advantage from it. In most cases he is not 
satisfied by getting through with the least possible exertion. 
He means to do reasonably well, but he has no idea of the benefit 
to be derived from striving for excellence. In short, he has a 
fair, but not a high standard. 
Now, there is no grave difficulty in enforcing a fair amount of 
work; and of late years our colleges have wisely turned their 
attention to the matter, making the minimum requirements 
distinctly more severe than they were. We can, in fact, raise 
the minimum for a degree to any level that we may desire, pro- 
vided we recognize frankly what that level implies. Suppose, 
for example, that the dullest tenth of the students who enter 
college ought not to graduate, no matter how faithfully they 
toil; then the line will be drawn at such a point that the dullest
-P-A-G-E-217
INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 195 
man above that tenth can get through if he devotes to study 
as many hours as a young man of ordinary health can properly 
spend over his books. But, in that case, a brighter man will 
need less effort to reach the same result; and, as differences in 
natural ability are very great, a student who stands in capacity 
among the more talented half of his class can get through with 
very little work. On the other hand, we could so draw the line 
that only the brighter half of the class could graduate at all; 
and in that case we should have, like the German universities, 
a large mass of students who had no intention of taking a degree, 
but who could hardly be refused the privilege of living about 
the college as special students so long as they were well behaved. 
We can, therefore, set the minimum where we please,—a 
minimum, however, in which the amount of work required is in 
inverse proportion to natural ability—and we cannot by that 
process compel a clever student to be industrious. We can set 
a minimum of capacity, and establish a ratio between brains 
and labor, but we cannot thereby set up a high standard for 
men of ability. For that purpose we need something more than 
a minimum requirement, and this brings us to our really difficult 
problem, that of applying a stimulus. 
College work may affect the fortunes of a lifetime more pro- 
foundly than the studies either of boyhood or of the professional 
school, but the ordinary student does not know it. The con- 
nection is too vague, too subtle, for him to see; it rests on in 
tangible principles, the force of which he does not feel. It is 
in college, therefore, that an external stimulus is most needed; 
yet college is the very place where it is found the least. The 
result is that a fellow who ranks high in school, and works like 
a tiger when he studies his profession, is too often quite satisfied 
with mediocrity in college. The disintegration of the curric- 
ulum caused by the elective system in any of its common forms, 
the disdain of rank as a subject for ambition,—encouraged by 
students, by the public, and sometimes even by instructors,— 
and other forces that have crept in unawares, have brought us 
to a point where competition as a stimulus for scholarship 
has been well-nigh driven from the college. Again, I must ask
-P-A-G-E-218
  | 
196 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
you not to misunderstand mewhen I speak of the elective system. 
No sane man would propose to restore anything resembling 
a fixed curriculum in any of our larger colleges. We must not 
go backward, we could not if we would; but neither must we 
believe that progress consists in standing still. We must go 
forward, and our path must be such that a choice of electives 
shall not lessen, among those capable of it, the stimulus to 
excellence. 
Now, there is no reason to suppose that young men have by 
nature a stronger desire for physical than’ for intellectual power, 
or a greater admiration for it; yet, largely by the free use of com- 
petition, athletics, in the esteem both of undergraduates and 
of the community at large, has beaten scholarship out of sight. 
The world to-day has a far higher regard for Newton, Locke, and 
Moliére than for Augustus the Strong; but in our colleges “the 
physically strong,” as Carlyle called Augustus, would attract 
much more attention. I am not one of those who condemn 
athletic contests, for I do not think we can afford to diminish 
any spur to activity in college, but Iam convinced that we ought 
to stimulate other forms of energy, and that we can get many a 
hint from athletic experience. The production of true scholars, 
or even of the scholarly tone of mind, is not the only object of 
the college. It aims to produce men well developed in all 
directions, and it has many agencies for doing so outside the 
class-room; but it cannot exist for these alone, and if it fails on 
the scholarly side it will be irrevocably doomed. 
One hundred years ago the English universities awoke to 
behold the low state of scholarship among their students. It 
boots nothing to inquire how it compared with the worst that has 
ever existed here, but it was bad enough. They met it by a 
resort to frank competition. First in one subject, and then in 
another, they established a degree with honors awarded in several 
grades, and they succeeded in. making the honors, not only a 
goal of ambition, but, what is more, an object of general respect. 
They have prizes, too, which are eagerly sought; and, in short, 
the stimulus to scholarship rests on an elaborate system of com- 
petition for prizes and honors. Of course, there are voices
-P-A-G-E-219
  INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 197 
raised against it, protesting that the muses ought to be wooed 
for worthier motives; but it is our province to make the most 
of men as they are, not to protest that they ought to have an 
innate love of learning. The problem of human nature, the 
question whether we could have made it better if we had 
presided at creation, is too large to discuss here. 
The fact remains that the Oxford and Cambridge men are 
firmly persuaded that success at the bar, in public life, and in 
other fields is closely connected with high honors at graduation; 
and the contest for them is correspondingly keen. The prizes 
and honors are made widely known; they are remembered 
throughout a man’s life, referred to even in brief notices of 
him,—much as his athletic feats are here—and they certainly 
do help him powerfully to get a start in his career. The result 
is that, by the Isis and the Cam, there is probably more hard 
study done in subjects not of a professional character than in 
any other universities in the world. What defects the system 
may possess, its strength and its weakness in other directions 
need not detain us. The structure of English society, on which 
the old universities are built, is very different from ours; yet 
there are qualities in human nature that are common to all 
mankind, and without copying an institution we may, by ob- 
serving it, discover the secret of its success. Although we do 
not follow, we may learn. 
Competition as an effective stimulus to scholarship in our 
colleges suffers to-day from a widespread feeling among the 
students that the distinctions won are a test of industry rather 
than of superior intellectual power. This conviction finds its 
expression in the term “grind,” wh'ch is applied with great 
impartiality to all high scholars, instead of being reserved, as 
it seems to me it was formerly, to a certain kind of laborious 
mediocrity. The general use of the word is certainly unjust, 
for statistics show that, as compared with other men, the high 
scholars win a far larger share of distinction in the professional 
schools and in after life. But the feeling contains a grain of 
truth. In our desire to insure from every student a fair amount 
of work, we are too apt to use tests that measure mere diligence,
-P-A-G-E-220
  198 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
with the result that high rank in college is no sure measure of 
real ability. This has been to a great extent avoided in England 
by distinct honor and pass examinations, the questions in the 
former being of such a nature that industry alone cannot, it is 
believed, attain the highest grade; and this is an important 
matter if high rank is to command admiration. It is surely 
possible to devise tests which will measure any qualities that 
we desire to emphasize; but do we not touch here upon one 
of many indications that we have lost the key to the true mean- 
ing of the college? The primary object of the professional 
schools is knowledge, a command of the tools of the trade, and 
a facility in handling them; while in college the primary object 
is intellectual power, and a knowledge of facts or principles 
is the material on which the mind can exercise its force, rather 
than an end in itself. If we could make the world believe that 
high rank is a proof of intellectual power, our task in instilling 
among undergraduates a desire to excel would be simple. 
The difficulty in stimulating a scholarly ambition is enhanced 
by a new, and on the whole a higher, moral tone among college 
men. ‘The philosophers of a century ago preached the harmony 
of interests both in politics and economics. They taught that, 
in seeking his own highest good, a man promoted that of all the 
world; and they looked forward to a millennium based on uni- 
versal self-interest. With the waning of this creed, a more 
altruistic spirit has replaced. the extreme individualism of our 
fathers, and, as usual, the new tendencies are particularly strong 
in the rising generation. In college, the upper classmen feel a 
responsibility for the welfare of the younger students, and look 
after them, to an extent that would have been regarded as 
extraordinary, if not indeed meddlesome, half a century ago. 
The sense of mutual obligation, and with it the corporate 
spirit, has grown apace. A man no longer wants to feel that 
he is working for himself alone; he wants to labor for the organ- 
ization of which he forms a part, because that seems to him a 
nobler motive. This is one reason for the halo that surrounds 
the athlete; while the scholar seems to be striving for nothing 
better than personal distinction. If he is seeking a pecuniary
-P-A-G-E-221
   INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 199 
scholarship, his aim, though needful, appears sordid; if not, it 
seems at best selfish, and therefore unworthy of the highest 
admiration. But the member of the football team, who risks 
his limbs in a glorious cause, whose courage and devotion are 
placed freely at the service of his alma mater, stands out as a 
hero worthy of all the praise that can be lavished upon him. 
Many a man, deaf to all other appeals, can be induced to make 
a creditable record in his studies on the ground that otherwise 
he cannot play upon a team, and that it is his duty to do some- 
thing for the honor of his college. Such sentiments deserve 
respect, although to a serene philosopher they may seem a 
substitution of co-operative for personal selfishness. But they 
assuredly place an obstacle in the path of anyone who would try 
to raise the esteem for scholarly attainment. The under- 
graduate sees no way in which scholarship adds luster to his 
college, and this complicates the problem of making it admirable 
in his eyes. 
We have seen that the sifting out of young men capable of 
scholarship is receiving to-day less attention than it deserves; and 
that this applies, not only to recruiting future leaders of thought, 
but also to prevailing upon every young man to develop the 
intellectual powers he may possess. We have seen also that, 
while the Graduate School can train scholars, it cannot create 
love of scholarship. That work must be done in undergraduate 
days. We have found reason to believe that during the whole 
period of training, mental and physical, which reaches its cul- 
mination in college, competition is not only a proper but an 
essential factor; and we have observed the results achieved at 
Oxford and Cambridge by its use. In this country, on the other 
hand, several causes, foremost among them the elective system, 
have almost banished competition in scholarship from our col- 
leges; while the inadequate character of our tests, and the cor- 
porate nature of self-interest in these latter times, raise serious 
difficulties in making it effective. 
Nevertheless I have faith that these obstacles can be over- 
come, and that we can raise intellectual achievement in college 
to its rightful place in public estimation.’ We are told that it

in so far as we have failed in this, we have come short of what 
we ought to do. Universities stand for the eternal worth of 
thought, for the preéminence of the prophet and the seer; 
but, instead of being thrilled by the eager search for truth, 
our classes too often sit listless on the bench. It is not because 
the lecturer is dull, but because the pupils do not prize the end 
enough to relish the drudgery required for skill in any great 
pursuit, or indeed in any sport. To make them see the great-

for it, we must learn—and herein lies the secret—we must 
learn the precious art of touching their imagination. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. Do the students of your college seem indifferent to study? If 
so, what do you regard as the chief causes? 2. Discuss the problem 
of encouraging scholarship, showing means that might be used. 
3. What is the attitude among the students of your college in regard 
to high rank and college honors? 4. To what extent is success in life 
to be associated with winning honors at college? For a refutation 
of the fallacy that there is “no connection between examination 
grades and post-collegiate success,” see the article by President 
Lowell, “ College Rank and Distinction in Life,” in The Ailantic 
Monthly, Vol. 92, page 512. 5. What is the system of grading in 
vogue at your institution, and how satisfactory is it? 6. In esti- 
mating a student’s grade upon a recitation how much weight should 
be given to all or any of the following factors? 
“The main factors represented by grades intelligently given may be 
described by the six terms: time, effort, mental ability, memory, language 
sense and preparation. The relative importance of these factors varies 
widely with the nature of the subject, but all are involved in every intel- 
lectual pursuit. The order chosen is that of directness of control by the 
student. 
“Time.—This includes both that in attendance on classes and that given 
to the subject outside of class hours. Irregularity of attendance on classes 
and deficiency of outside preparation would have their obvious results in 
this factor, irrespective of the reasons for such irregularity or deficiency. 
“Effort-—This factor includes the practice of concentration in and out of 
class, largely a result of past habits; thoroughness of thought, which passes 
nothing until really grasped; and system, which insures sustained and con- 
tinuous work as opposed to cramming at intervals. 
“ Mental Ability.—This is evidenced by the ease and accuracy with which 
new ideas are grasped. It is of course largely a natural endowment, devel- 
oped, however, or allowed to deteriorate, slowly by its exercise or its disuse. 
This factor is most important in subjects of a strongly reasoning character. 
“‘Memory.—By this term is meant the retaining of ideas rather than the 
memorizing of words or symbols; it is mainly a natural endowment but 
somewhat subject to cultivation by mental activity. 
“Language Sense.—By this is meant the ability to understand and to use 
language with precision. It is probably to some degree a natural gift, but 
is also largely a result of early training and associations and an appreciation 
of its importance. The student who cannot express his own ideas clearly 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  202 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS haste AND PROBLEMS 
usually receives only vague impressions from his oral or printed instruction. 
‘The language sense can be cultivated by sustained effort directed to that end. 
“Preparation.—This includes general education along intellectual lines, 
to which appeal can be made for analogies and illustrations. It also means 
a proper command. of the earlier part of the same subject and of other sub- 
jects directly used as foundational material and as tools; grades wisely given 
in these antecedent subjects indicate clearly the adequacy of this direct 
preparation. It is in this factor that the student who has habitually aimed 
at passing rather than grasping his curriculum encounters the natural con- 
sequences in his increasing difficulties. 
“Tn conclusion it may be noted that time and effort are under immediate 
control; mental ability, memory and language sense are subject to slow 
cultivation; and preparation is beyond present control. Of course less than 
all the allotted time, or less than the student’s best effort, or less than an 
average rating in factors, would necessitate correspondingly higher values 
for the other factors that an average grade might be earned.” Science, N.S., 
Volume 39, page 358. 
7. In giving credit for courses toward graduation, should quality 
as well as quantity of work be taken into account? ‘That is, should 
a course completed by one student with a low grade be considered 
as representing less work accomplished than the same course com- 
pleted by another student with high grade, and therefore be counted 
as less credit towards graduation? An advocate of this method of 
giving credit in courses puts the matter thus: ‘Now in the labora- 
tory, work done is always computed as the product of two factors: 
a quantity factor and an intensity factor. Just as mechanical work 
is the product of force and distance, so mental work in college may 
be estimated as the product of amount and quality; that is, of the 
number of courses and the grades attained. This analogy, though 
not perfect, suggests a pertinent question. In determining the fitness 
of a candidate, why not count quality as a definite and considerable 
factor?” Foster, W. T., “ The Gentleman’s Grade,” Educational 
Review, Vol. 33, page 386. See also Foster, W. T., “The College 
Curriculum.” 8. Compare working for grades with more worthy 
incentives to good scholarship.

THE PROGRESSIVENESS OF THE SCIENCES! 
Joun CairD 
[For note on author see page 116. This selection is one of the author’s 
addresses to the students of the University of Glasgow, delivered November, 
1875-] 
Last session the topic on which I took leave to address you 
was “The Unity of the Sciences,’—the relation, that is, of the 
various departments of knowledge to each other as parts of one 
organic whole. It may be said to be the peculiar function 
of a University to teach science, or the universal element in 
human knowledge; and, again, University teaching has this 
as a further characteristic of it, that it visibly represents the 
systematic unity of the various departments of knowledge, not 
merely by the juxtaposition of their teachers in a common 
seat of learning, but by the subjection of the whole work of 
education carried on within its walls to a common idea or 
system. In short, what according to this view lends distinctive 
significance to the name University is, that it is an institution 
which teaches or professes to teach, what is universal in all 
departments of knowledge, and each separate department in 
its relation to universal knowledge. 
It is to another characteristic of the sciences, which concerns 
us no less than their unity, that I purpose to-day, for a few 
minutes, to direct your attention—I mean, their progressive- 
ness. The history of human knowledge is a history, on the 
whole, of a continuous and ever-accelerating progress. In 
some of its departments this characteristic may be more marked 
and capable of easier illustration than in others. External 
accidents, affecting the history of nations, may often have dis- 
turbed or arrested the onward movement, or, even for a time, 
seem to have altogether obliterated the accumulated results 
of the thought of the past. But on the whole the law is a 
constant one, which constitutes each succeeding age the in-

204 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
heritor of the intellectual wealth of all preceding ages, and 
makes it its high vocation to hand on the heritage it has re- 
ceived, enriched by its own contributions, to that which comes 
after. In almost every department of knowledge the modern 
student begins where innumerable minds have been long at 
work, and with the results of the observation, the experience, 
the thought and speculation of the past to help him. If the 
field of knowledge were limited, this, indeed, would, in one 
point of view, be a discouraging thought; for we should in that 
case be only as gleaners coming in at the close of the day to 
gather up the few scanty ears that had been left, where other 
laborers had reaped the substantial fruits of the soil. But, so 
far from that, vast and varied as that body of knowledge which 
is the result of past research may seem to be, the human race 
may, without exaggeration, be said to have only entered on 
its labors, to have gathered in only the first fruits of a field 
which ‘stretches away interminably before it. 
Now it is this condition or characteristic of human knowl- 
edge which constitutes the inspiration and the ever-present 
stimulus of intellectual effort. Without its quickening influ- 
ence, thought and research would lose half their charm. If 
we cannot assent to the paradoxical notion of some thinkers 
that the chief value of knowledge is not in the possession, but 
‘in the pursuit of it; if there are few who would indorse the 
well-known saying of Malebranche, “If I held truth captive 
in my hand, I should open my hand and let it fly, in order that 
I might pursue it again”; yet this much may be conceded, that 
the known, the mastered and established facts of knowledge, 
derive a great part of their value from their relation to the 
unknown and the undiscovered. As we review the history of 
science, we are impressed by the fact that the greatest dis- 
coveries, however important in themselves as a contribution 
to human knowledge, have been incalculably more important, 
as stepping-stones to subsequent and still greater advances. 
And we in turn, in our day, feel in our intellectual labors the 
power of the future pressing on us. It is the new hopes that 
are ever arising in us in the search after truth; it is the stir

of unresting endeavor, the impossibility of stationariness or 
stagnation, the excitement of inquiry, the wonder and delight 
of new ideas, of the world of thought breaking upon us with 
the ever-unabated charm of novelty; it is the sense of ever- 
growing power, the ever-increasing amount of our intellectual 
possessions, and prophetic glimpses of richer, yet still un- 
appropriated, treasures that lie beyond us; it is, in short, this 
atmosphere of progressiveness which lends a peculiar interest 
and attractiveness to the vocation of the student and the 
searcher after truth. To few, indeed, is it given to be great dis- 
coverers or original thinkers, to know, by experience, the delight 
of the mind on which some great result of thought or investi- 
gation—a new law of nature, or speculative principle, or con- 
ception of creative imagination in the realm of art—comes, 
now, perhaps, dimly foreshadowed, now shaping itself into 
dawning, deepening fullness and distinctness of outline, at 
length grasped with the.firm sense of realized certainty of pos- 
session. But though this peculiar experience is that only of 
the few, we can all, at least at second hand, share in the stim- 
ulus which the thoughts and discoveries of the higher and 
more gifted minds afford; and the humblest laborer in the field 
of science may feel himself partaking in the common movement, 
and in the intellectual activity of his own mind responding 
to the unresting activity which pervades the world of thought. 
The immediate duty, it is true, of the great majority of those 
whom I address is that, not of discoverers, but of learners. 
Whether in future years it shall be given to any of us to rise 
to the rank of original thinkers or investigators, for we 
must be content to belong, at best, to that of the receptive 
and transmitting order, to whom is allotted the humbler office 
of being the conductors or interpreters of thought to the com- 
mon mind, in the meantime, at least, our work is to gain, by 
the aid of skillful teachers, some acquaintance in various di- 
rections with the extant body of knowledge, with the languages 
and literature of the past, with the facts and principles con- 
cerning the outward world of nature or the inner world of mind 
which have been found out and established. But even here,
-P-A-G-E-228
    
206 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
in this our proper vocation of students and learners, we may 
and do get the benefit indirectly of that spirit of progressiveness 
which is the life of science. If not immediately acting on your 
own minds, it acts on you through your teachers. Though 
not directly controlling your own aims and inquiries, it is re- 
flected upon you in the intellectual atmosphere in which you 
daily breathe, in the living power and influence which ever 
penetrates the instructions of a teacher who is abreast with 
his science and seeking by his own investigations to contribute 
to its progress. Universities, especially Universities constituted 
as our Scottish Universities are, are places where a body of 
men are, for the most part, withdrawn from all other work 
but that of study and thought—men to whom knowledge is a 
profession, with, ample leisure for prolonged inquiry, each 
in his special department, and a command of the best appli- 
ances for private research. Such places ought to be, and I 
am happy to think that our Universities have generally been, 
centers of intellectual activity. Seldom, if ever, have their 
professors been content to be mere routine teachers of stock 
ideas or transmitters of accepted traditions; generally they 
have added to the function of communicating the other and 
higher function of extending the bounds of knowledge. I 
need not recall the names of Scottish professors whose con- 
tributions to literature and science and philosophy have given 
an impulse to the thought of former times; nor is the ancient 
fame of this University in our own day likely to suffer for 
lack of productive activity on the part of its teachers. 
Now, what for my present purpose I wish to say with refer- 
ence to this fact is, that though the function of the original 
thinker and investigator and that of the teacher are distinct, 
yet the latter ever derives from the former a great access of 
power—a power which, in the most elementary work of the 
class-room, will be sure to tell. It is not merely that the daily 
presence of a man eminent in the department he teaches has 
an insensible influence on the minds of the students which he 
can never exert who works merely from hand to mouth, know- 
ing little more of his science than he daily doles out to his pupils; 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 207 
it is that the man who speaks from a full mind, with a com- 
plete mastery of his subject and a genuine enthusiasm for its 
advancement, whose own powers are kept at their highest tension 
by original and exhaustive inquiry, will infuse into the ordi- 
nary routine of instruction a spirit and life, a freshness and ardor, 
which a commonplace mind can never communicate. It is, 
in one word, that the teaching of such a mind will transmit to 
other minds that with which it is itself penetrated—the power 
of that progressive spirit which is the life of science. 
But now, passing from these general considerations, is it in 
point of fact true, it may be asked, that progressiveness is the 
universal characteristic of human knowledge? Are there not 
departments of study in which the productions that approach 
nearest to perfection are to be found, not in the present, but 
in the past, so that nothing is left to succeeding ages but to 
endeavor to imitate those exquisite works of the genius of 
antiquity which they can never hope to excel? Are there not 
again, it may be asked, some subjects with respect to which 
experience proves that the mind of man can make little or no 
advancement beyond the point reached at a very early period 
by one or two master minds of ancient times; and others in 
which the period of greatest illumination for the human mind 
was more than eighteen centuries ago, nay, in which the very 
organ of knowledge has for ages beeri an unused faculty, and 
wisdom at this entrance quite shut out? If we look only to 
the domain of the physical sciences, we see that here modern 
times are at an immense distance in advance of ancient; and 
there are obvious reasons on which we may base the conviction 
that the progress of these sciences will be still greater and more 
rapid in the future. As the number of observers increases and, 
with that, the possibility of the subdivision, comparison, and 
correctness of observation; as methods of investigation improve, 
and the application of science to the mechanical arts leads 
to the construction of instruments more delicate and incal- 
culably adding to the power of observation; and still more signif- 
icantly, as province after province of science is reduced to a 
condition of generalization, to which mathematical processes of   
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  208 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
reasoning can be applied; it is impossible that man’s knowledge 
of the inexhaustible realm of nature should not go on in an ever- 
increasing ratio. f 
But, while from these and other causes, in the domain of 
Physical Science, each successive generation is surely destined 
to advance by rapid strides on the attainments of its predeces- 
sors; there are‘other departments of mental activity in which 
neither experience nor the reason of the thing, it may be said, 
leads us to look for the same progressiveness. Can we ascribe 
it to the same extent, or indeed at all, to Literature and Art, 
to Philosophy, to Theology? Is it to modern or ancient times 
that we look for the most perfect masterpieces of purely literary 
art? Has language ever afforded a medium of expression, at 
once so varied and so accurate, so subtle and refined, lending 
itself with such infinite flexibility to the most delicate distinc- 
tions of thought, and to the endlessly diversified tones of feeling 
and fancy, clothing with aptest forms the severe dialectic of 
philosophy, and the impassioned inspirations of epic or dramatic 
genius—has language ever afforded a more perfect instrument 
of thought than that which, though dead, yet speaks to us from 
the lips of the orators and poets, the historains and philosophers 
of ancient Greece? Not to speak of their historic value, or of 
the substantive excellence of their contents, when we wish to 
place before the students of our day models of finished and 
faultless excellence in form and expression, examples by which 
he can be trained in the principles that regulate the formation 
and structure of language, the precise and accurate use of words, 
the delicacies of styles, the simplicity, the terse conciseness, the 
measured rhythmical sweetness, the elevated grandeur, the 
sustained force and vivacity of which human speech is capable,— 
is it not the fact that we pass by all the treasures of modern 
literature, to put into his hands, and bid him spend laborious 
days and nights in mastering and appreciating, the works of the 
great writers of classical antiquity? And the same observation 
applies to some extent also to ancient art in general. Are not 
the remains of Greek sculpture and architecture the envy and 
the despair of modern artists? Is not much, at least, of modern
-P-A-G-E-231
  INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 209 
art only an endeavor to reproduce with laborious imitation the 
lines and forms of those works which were flung forth, with the 
spontaneous ease and exuberance of genius, from the creative 
spirit of Greek and Roman art? 
If, again, we turn from Art to Philosophy, to some it would 
seem as if here too we have an exception to the alleged pro- 
gressiveness of human knowledge. To outsiders at least, it will 
be said, it looks as if not much has ever come of metaphysical 
speculation. Is not the history of speculative thought, it may 
be asked, a record of endless motion without advancement? In 
each successive age do we not find the old divisions and contro- 
versies reproduced without apparently any nearer approach to 
definite results? Are not philosophers still disputing about the 
same questions on which Plato and Aristotle thought and 
reasoned? Idealism and empiricism, materialism and spiritual- 
ism, dogmatism and skepticism, utilitarianism and intuitional- 
ism—do not these various schools of thought find their advocates 
in modern times, each as eager and earnest, as thoroughly con- 
vinced of the absolute and exclusive truth of his own standpoint, 
as the representatives of the same schools in all past times? 
And if there be any one school that is, more than another, the 
fashion of our day, that can claim a wider consensus of opinion 
than others, is there not a strange irony in the fact that it is 
a school which makes it the business of philosophy to prove 
that philosophy is an impossibility, that the necessary limits of 
human thought preclude all knowledge of the supersensible, 
and that the attempt to grasp absolute truth is a delirium or a 
dream? 
Now, however plausible such representations may sound to 
the popular ear, I think it would not be difficult to show that 
they are fallacious and superficial. Neither Art nor Philosophy, 
nor, I will add, Theology, constitutes any exception to that law 
of progress which conditions all human knowledge. That I 
may not trespass too far on your indulgence, I will leave over 
for the present what might be said on Art and on the still more 
delicate and perilous subject of Theology, and in the few minutes 
that remain to me, confining myself to only one of the above-
-P-A-G-E-232
  210 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
named departments, I shall try very briefly to show that the 
much maligned science of Philosophy can justly claim to be a 
progressive science. 
The doubt or denial of this claim, whether tacit or avowed, is 
grounded, as I have just said, on the never-ending succession 
of opinions and systems issuing in no definite and universally 
established results, which seems to characterize the history of 
metaphysical speculation. Each new system purports to have 
reached the secret of the universe, and denounces all previous 
explanations as futile. Yet each in turn, after attracting more 
or less attention, meets the universal fate—succumbs to some 
newer, yet equally transient, attempt to construct a perfect 
philosophy. Where then, in this restless flux of opinion, can 
we discern any sign of definite progress? Amidst the diversity 
and conflict of systems, how shall a plain and unsophisticated 
inquirer determine which is true, or whether the pretensions of 
the last and newest system are better grounded than any of 
those which it claims to supersede? 
Now, in the first place, I think it necessary to remark that 
a plain and unsophisticated observer is not, in this case, a 
competent judge. Whether Philosophy has progressed or 
not, whether beneath the appearance of incessant change 
there has been a silent and steady advance of thought, is a 
question which cannot be determined by outsiders. In no case, 
indeed, can science be adequately appreciated from without; 
but of all branches of science, Philosophy can least suffer its 
acquisitions to be tested by external criticism. In the case 
of the physical sciences or the mechanical arts, dealing as 
they do with sensible facts, or appealing to results bearing on 
the outward utilities of life, there is a possibility, up to a certain 
point, of progress being tested and recognized by the popular 
mind. But Philosophy has its peculiar domain in a region 
altogether remote from popular observation, in the region of 
thought, of ideas, of the ultimate and invisible principles of 
things. Its objects are not discerned by the senses, capable 
of being represented to the imagination, or realized by the 
natural shrewdness or ordinary good sense of the world. It 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
   INTELLECTUAL IDEALS aur 
demands for its prosecution a power of abstraction, of generali- 
zation, of speculative insight, which is not given to all; and an 
intellectual self-restraint, and superiority to outward illusions, 
which few are capable of yielding to it. Strait is the gate 
and narrow is the way that leads to this kingdom, and few 
there be that find it. Yet, it would seem as if, even more than 
the other sciences, Philosophy is expected to make its results 
palpable to the ordinary and unscientific mind—to stand and 
be judged by that generalization of common ignorance which 
we designate “common sense.” Common sense is never al- 
lowed to sit in judgment on mathematical investigations, on 
a process involving delicate experimental analysis, on the 
correctness of a medical diagnosis, on a question of comparative 
philology or ethnology. In these cases uninstructed shrewd- 
ness is not offended to find that the language of science is to it 
unintelligible, its methods and processes an utter blank. Yet or- 
dinary intelligence is somehow supposed to be quite adequate 
to the work of estimating the methods and results of a science, 
the most recondite of all; takes upon it to flout at what it 
calls the jargon of metaphysics, and is credited with wisdom 
in treating the results of speculative research as empty words. 
Again, it is to be remarked that, owing to the remoteness 
of philosophy from ordinary thought, there is another difficulty 
with which it has to contend, and a further hindrance to the 
recognition of its substantial results. Here, more than else- 
where, science is subjected to the presence of impostors, while 
here it is less easy than elsewhere to detect and expose them. 
There are many who give themselves the air of metaphysicians 
and psychologists with whom philosophy has nothing to do, 
yet the discredit of whose crudenesses and absurdities, in the 
general judgment, philosophy is often made to bear. All 
sciences, indeed, are more or less exposed to the intrusion of 
pretenders and charlatans; and in science, no more than in 
any other sphere of human activity, is it possible to prevent, 
occasionally, an element of nonsense from creeping in. But 
this is an evil which, from the nature of the thing, is more 
common in philosophy than anywhere else. For, though its 
     
    
                            
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  212 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
province is in one sense remote, in another it is near and fa- 
miliar. Though not many can grasp it, all, or almost all, can 
talk about it. It deals with mind, with ideas, with the prin- 
ciples and processes of thought; and everybody has in his 
possession, at least implicitly, the subject matter with which 
it concerns itself: everybody has, or thinks he has, a mind 
and ideas. And so, mistaking the familiar for the intelligible, 
without science, culture, or discipline, multitudes who are 
shut out by conscious ignorance from other sciences, have 
thought themselves entitled to rush into this field. The lit- 
erature of philosophy is thus exceptionally beset by extrava- 
gances and vagaries, by crude observations, ill-sifted notions, 
and baseless theories—in short, by the element of nonsense. 
From which it arises that people who have no liking for the 
subject, or who have caught up a prejudice against it, find 
ready to their hands a thousand illustrations of the uselessness 
and unprofitableness of metaphysics. But surely, if we would 
estimate the true value and solid results of philosophy, we 
should begin by brushing off this fofeign and parasitical ele- 
ment. If controversies about the squaring of the circle or the 
perpetual motion are not to be set down to the discredit of 
mathematical or mechanical science; if the pseudo-science of 
Astrology or the dreams of alchemists and Rosicrucians are 
not suffered to abate our respect for the sober investigations 
of Astronomy or Chemistry, why should a like careful dis- 
crimination not be made when we come to consider what is 
or is not included in that body of truth for which philosophy 
is responsible? The history of philosophy is indeed rife with 
conflicts and controversies; but the senseless quarrels of camp 
followers and hangers-on have no bearing on the great con- 
troversies of nations, nor even on the issue of a single campaign. 
But though it is impossible outside of philosophy to demon- 
strate its reality and its progress—though, in other words, it 
is only a knowledge of philosophy that can qualify us for 
appreciating its progressive character; yet, waiving for the 
present other points, there is one general consideration with 
respect to the history of this science which, even without this| 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
INTELLECTUAL IDEALS : 213 
deeper knowledge, may help us to see how there may be real 
progress here despite that appearance of fluctuation, that 
absence of settled results, to which I have referred. And that 
consideration is simply this, that the highest kind of progress 
is not progress by addition or accumulation, but progress by 
development, and development implies the perpetual trans- 
mutation of the past. There is one kind of progress which 
consists simply of addition of the same to the same, or of the 
external accumulation of materials. But increase by addi- 
tion, even though it be ordered or regulated addition, is not 
the highest kind of advancement. Pile heap on heap of inor- 
ganic matter, and you have a result in which nothing is changed; 
the lowest stratum of the pile remains to the last what it was 
at the first, and you keep all you ever had in solid permanence. 
Add stone to stone or brick to brick, till the house you have 
built stands complete from foundation to copestone; and here, 
though in order and system there may be a shadow of something 
higher than mere quantity, there is still only addition without 
progress. You have here also what the superficial mind covets 
as the sign of value in its possessions—permanent results, solid 
and stable reality. Every stone you place there remains to 
the last cut, hewn, shaped, in all its hard external actuality, 
what it was at the first: and the whole edifice, in its definite 
outward completeness stands, it may be, for ages, a permanent 
possession of the world. 
But when you turn from inorganic accumulation or addition 
of quantities to organic growth, the kind of progress you get 
is altogether different. Here you never for a single day or hour 
keep firm possession of what you once had. Here there is 
never-resting mutation. What you now have is no sooner 
reached than it begins to slip away from your grasp. One form 
lof existence comes into being only to be abolished and oblit- 
erated by that which succeeds it. Seed or germ, peeping bud, 
ising stem, leaf and blossom, flower and fruit, are things that 
o not continue side by side as part of a permanent store, 
ut each owes its present existence to the annulling of that 
hich was before. You cannot possess at one and the same 
     
                                
      
   
   
   
   
    
    
   
-P-A-G-E-236

time the tender grace of the vernal woods and the rich pro- 
fusion of color and blossom of the later growth of summer. 
If you are ever to gather in the fruit, you must be content 
that the gay blossoms should shrivel up and drop away. Yet 
though, in organic development you cannot retain the past, 
it is not destroyed or annihilated. In a deeper way than by 
actual matter-of-fact presence and preservation, it continues. 
Each present phase of the living organism has in it the vital 
result of all that it has been. The past is gone, but the organism 
could not have become what it is without the past. Every 
bygone moment of its existence still lives in it, and indeed as 
it was, but absorbed, transformed, worked up into the essence 
of its new and higher being. And when the perfection of the 
organism is reached, the unity of the perfectly developed life 
is one which gathers up into itself, not by juxtaposition or 
summation, but in a much subtler way, the concentrated re- 
sults of all its bygone history. And by how much life is nobler 
than dead matter, by so much are the results and fruits of life 
the manifestation of a nobler kind of progress than the accumu- 
lation of things which are at once nermanent and lifeless, and 
permanent because they are lifeless. 
Now, the claim of philosophy—a claim asserted by its great- 
est modern representatives—is that the history of speculative 
thought, like the whole history of man of which it is the highest 
form and expression, is not an accidental succession of opinions, 
but a development—the evolution through definite stages of 
an ever-growing organic life. Philosophy does not advance by 
mere empirical addition of fact to fact, and opinion to opinion; 
its history is that of a process, a systematic development, each 
step of which, though true, is not the absolute truth, and| 
therefore yields to and is taken up into another and higher 
in the dialectic movement of the thought of the world. And 
as in the process of physical life, each successive phase an 
form, though it seems to be the subversion, is only the deepe: 
realization of that which preceded it. The first step, like th 
germ, contains ideally and implicitly the whole subsequent 
development; and the last, in the fullness and riches of its life} 
       
                      
     
            
    
   
    
  
-P-A-G-E-237
INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 215 
absorbs and explains, is in itself the truth and realization of all 
that seems to have passed away. 
The attempts, for instance, at the first awakening of specu- 
lative thought in Greek philosophy, to explain the world by 
such notions as Being, Becoming, the One, the Many, etc., 
might seem to have lost any other than a historic or anti- 
quarian interest. But even the ripest and most advanced 
philosophy of modern times has not refuted or falsified these 
notions of its earliest infancy. For the categories which seemed 
to these early thinkers the ultimate principles of things, do 
actually enter into the system of the world, and must enter 
into any rational explanation of it which our latest thought can 
give. They are the notions with which every philosophy must 
begin, and they are only false when we stop short at such 
abstractions, instead of regarding them as only the first faint 
notes of that rhythmical harmony of thought into which they 
have long been taken up. And even in these first beginnings 
of speculation we already see the process at work by which 
one philosophy, while seeming to be subverted, yet really 
passes into and yields up its life to another. “All is Being,” 
is the formula which expresses one and perhaps the earliest 
definite attempt to read the secret of the universe. “Change, 
division, multiplicity, are but surface appearance and illusion. 
There must be one permanent principle or ground of things, 
and all other experiences that seem to be are but phantoms.” 
“All is Becoming,” was the seemingly contradictory explana- 
tion of another and later school. ‘Nothing in the universe 
ontinues for two successive moments, but restless movement, 
tation, fleetingness, an eternal alternation of birth and 
lecay, life and death,—that alone is. The permanent is the 
llusory—what is, only seems to be; the real principle of things 
s to be found not in the idea of Being, but of Becoming.” And 
oth explanations were true; both principles needed to rise, 
nd have their day, and play themselves out to the fullest, 
efore thought, obeying its own inward impulse, rose to a higher 
rinciple which at once superseded and embraced them—a 
rinciple which includes both change and permanence, unity

and difference; which sees not the one only, or the many only, 
not the particular, the manifold, apart from the universal, , 
nor the universal apart from the particular, but a universal 
which is im the particular, a world which is neither in ab- 
straction, but both ever coincident, ever blended, ever recip- 
rocally interpenetrated in the concrete unity of thought and 
life. 
And so, in like manner, at another and far distant time, 
when a deeper problem arose for solution, the problem of matter 
and mind, of the world without, and its relation to the world 
within, it would be easy to show how, beginning with the hard 
opposition of the two, speculation first playing with meta- 
phorical solutions, such as that of a mental tablet on which 
impressions are inscribed from without, sought on the one hand 
the explanation of materialism; on the other, by necessary 
reaction, that of false or subjective idealism, till the truth 
in both was taken up, and the error eliminated in a deeper 
philosophy, which says, “Both are true, but neither in ab- 
straction from the other. Neither materialism in itself, nor 
idealism in itself, neither bare objectivity, nor bare subjectivity; 
but the secret is to be found in that deeper concrete unity in 
which they are both lost and found again—the unity of self- 
conscious thought.” 
Thus, not to weary you with further illustration, what has 
been said may, at least in some faint measure, suggest to you} 
a view which removes from the history of philosophy that aspec' 
of chaos and perpetual contradiction issuing in no progressiv 
knowledge which has been so often urged against it. There i 
much, as I have already said, in the history of speculativ 
thought just as in the outward life of man, that belongs to th 
accidental and irrational—errors, vagaries, paradoxes, as 
suming the name and the guise of philosophy. But just as th 
student of the constitutional history of England can trac 
amidst all the complexity and contingency of outward an 
passing events, through successive times and dynasties, unde 
neath the waywardness of individual passion and the struggll 
for ascendancy of classes and orders,—the silent, steady deve!

INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 217 
opment of that system of ordered freedom which we name the 
Constitution of England; so, in the light of the principle I 
have attempted to set forth, looking back on the course which 
human thought has traveled, we shall be at no loss to discern 
beneath the surface changes of opinions, unaffected by the 
abnormal displays of individual folly and unreason, the traces 
of a continuous, onward movement of mind. It is one thought, 
one mind, and spirit which has lived'and thought through the 
ages. The intellectual life of the world is the intellectual life 
of the individual mind writ large. It is not dwarfed in per- 
petual childhood. It has grown from less to more; and the 
rich content of its present thought is no chance-medley of opin- 
ions, but the legitimate and logical outcome of all the thought 
of the past. 
And now let me ask in conclusion, is there not, in the idea 
I have imperfectly presented to you, that which should have 
a stimulating and ennobling influence on us in our vocation of 
students? Should it not help to lift us above ourselves, our 
petty individual aims, our narrow and selfish desires, to feel 
that we are sharers in a life which is infinitely larger and greater 
than our own—the ever-advancing intellectual life of man. 
The pursuit of knowledge is at once a humbling and ennobling 
work—humbling, because it is so little we individually can 
accomplish within the narrow limits of our brief and passing 
life; but ennobling, because no earnest seeker after truth, 
but, by the very nature and law of his vocation, enters into 
communion with the great intellectual fellowship of all time; 
and if he will but open his mind to the genius and spirit of his 
calling, may feel himself inspired with the purest and noblest 
aims that have ever animated the spirit of humanity. Little 
indeed is it that we, even the most richly dowered with the 
gifts of intellect, can do to advance the cause of truth. Slender 
at the best is the contribution we can make to the intellectual 
wealth of the world. But, slight though it be, it is surely 
something to think that it is taken up into and becomes an 
integral part of a life which neither space nor time can measure. 
Far above the agitation and strife of man’s petty passions,
-P-A-G-E-240
  
218 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
far above the individual cares and interests that seem for the 
moment so important, never hasting, never resting, onward 
through the ages, the life of thought and knowledge advances 
to its goal. What its course has been in the past is only an 
augury of the yet more splendid future that awaits it. Science, 
advancing to richer discoveries, and a more comprehensive 
grasp of the order and system of nature; philosophy, shedding 
new and fuller light on the deeper problems of thought; art, 
enriching the world with new and _ fairer creations; and the 
many-sided intelligence of man, freed from the idols and preju- 
dices that still encumber it, unfolding new capabilities of 
insight, and a new consciousness of power and freedom—if 
something like this is the intellectual destiny that lies before 
our race, is there not in the contemplation of it that which 
may inspire us with a high and ennobling sense of our work 
here, and of the ends to which such institutions as this are 
devoted? To work here in order to gain the knowledge that 
will qualify you to earn your bread is no dishonorable motive. 
To study for honors, to be inspired by the love of fame and 
reputation, if it be the reputation of acquirements that are in 
themselves good and noble, is no unworthy aim. But there is 
an intellectual virtue that is higher and purer than these, 
without some touch of which you can be no true student. For, 
as the highest patriotism is that of the man who thinks not 
of honor or rewards, but so loves his country that he is content 
to be forgotten, to lose himself altogether in the larger, dearer 
life for which he lives; so he only rises to the true nobility of 
the student’s calling who catches some sympathetic spark of 
that pure intellectual love, that love of knowledge for its own 
sake, which lifts him out of self into fellowship with those 
in all the ages whose life has been, and will be, the eternal life 
of thought.

popular mind appreciate the progressiveness of the physical sciences 
and the mechanical arts but fail to discover it in other fields like 
philosophy and art? 4. Take some field with which you are familiar 
and illustrate the point that the greatest discoveries have had their 
chief value as stepping-stones to greater advances. 5. Applying 
this idea of progressiveness in knowledge to the field of literature, 
what can be said in defense of, or in opposition to, our reverence of 
the achievements of the past? 
THE INFLUENCE OF DEMOCRACY ON THOUGHT? 
James BRYCE 
  
[James Bryce (1838 ) is a distinguished English jurist, historian, and 
statesman. From 1907 to 1913 he was British ambassador at Washington. 
Though prominent in many fields, Mr. Bryce is better known as a writer, 
and especially as the author of The American Commonwealth, the material for 
which was collected during visits to the United States in 1870, 1881, and 1883. 
It is probably the best account ever written of the political institutions of 
the United States, considered in their relation to the history, the character, 
and the habits of the American people. This selection is one of the chapters 
of this book.] 
Two opposite theories regarding the influence of democratic 
institutions on intellectual activity have found currency. One 
theory extols them because they stimulate the mind of a people, 
not only sharpening men’s wits by continual struggle and unrest, 
but giving to each citizen a sense of his own powers and duties 
in the world, which spurs him on to exertions in ever-widening 
fields. This theory is commonly applied to Athens and other 
democracies of the ancient world, as contrasted with Sparta and 
the oligarchic cities, whose intellectual production was scanty or 
altogether wanting. It compares the Rome of Cicero, Lucretius, 
and Catullus, and the Augustan age, whose great figures were 
born under the Republic, with the vaster but comparatively 
sterile Roman world of Marcus Aurelius or Constantine, when 
freedom had long since vanished. It notes the outburst of

literary and artistic splendor that fell in the later age of the 
republics of medieval Italy, and dwells with especial pleasure on 
the achievements of Florence, the longest-lived and the most 
glorious of the free commonwealths of Italy. 
According to the other theory, Democracy is the child of 
ignorance, the parent of dullness and conceit. The opinion of the 
greatest number being the universal standard, everything is 
reduced to the level of vulgar minds. Originality is stunted, 
variety disappears, no man thinks for himself, or, if he does, 
fears to express what he thinks. A drear pall of monotony 
covers the sky. 
“Thy hand, great Anarch, lets the curtain fall 
And universal darkness buries all.” 
This doctrine seems to date from the appearance of De Tocque- 
ville’s book,! though his professed disciples have pushed it much 
further than his words warrant. It is really an a priori doctrine, 
drawn from imagining what the consequences of a complete 
equality of material conditions and political powers ought to be. 
But it claims to rest upon the observed phenomena of the United 
States, which, thirty years ago, were still the only great modern 
democracy; and it was with reference to the United States that 
it was enunciated by Mr. Robert Lowe in one of those speeches 
of 1866 which so greatly impressed his contemporaries. 
Both these theories will be found on examination to be basc- 
less. Both, so far as they are a priori theories, are fanciful; 
both, in so far as they purport to rest upon the facts of history, 
err by regarding one set of facts only, and ignoring a great num- 
ber of concomitant conditions which have probably more to do 
with the result than the few conditions which have been arbi- 
trarily taken to be sufficient causes. None of the Greek republics 
was a democracy in the modern sense, for all rested upon slavery; 
nor, indeed, can the name be applied, except at passing moments, 
to the Italian cities. Many circumstances besides their popular 
government combined to place the imperishable crown of literary 
and artistic glory upon the brows of the city of the Violet and 
1 Democracy in America, by this French statesman and political writer.

the city of the Lily. So also the view that a democratic land 
is necessarily a land of barren monotony, while unsound even as 
a deduction from general principles, is still more unsound in its 
assumption of certain phenomena as true of America, and in the 
face it puts on the phenomena it has assumed. The theorists 
who have propounded it give us, like Daniel, the dream as well 
as their interpretation of it. But the dream is one of their own 
inventing; and such as it is, it is wrongly interpreted. 
Few mistakes are more common than that of exaggerating 
the influence of forms of government. As there are ‘historians 
and politicians who, when they come across a trait of national 
character for which no obvious explanation presents itself, set 
it down to “race,” so there are writers and speakers who, too 
indolent to examine the whole facts of the case, or too ill-trained 
to feel the need of such examination, pounce upon the political 
institutions of a country as the easiest way to account for its 
sccial and intellectual, perhaps even for its moral and religious 
peculiarities. Few problems are in reality more complex than 
tke relation between the political and the intellectual life of a 
country; few things more difficult to distinguish than the in- 
fluences respectively attributable to an equality of political rights 
and powers on the one hand, an equality of material and social 
conditions on the other. It is commonly assumed that Democ- 
racy and Equality go hand in hand, but as one may have 
popular government along with enormous differences of wealth 
and dissimilarities in social usage, so also one may have social 
equality under a despot. Doubtless, when social and political 
equality go hand in hand they intensify one another; but when 
inequality of material conditions becomes marked, social life 
changes, and as social phenomena become more complex their 
analysis becomes more difficult. 
Reverting to the two theories from which we set out, it may 
be said that the United States furnish little support to either. 
American democracy has certainly produced no age of Pericles. 
Neither has it dwarfed literature and led a wretched people, so 
dull as not even to, realize their dullness, into a barren plain of 
featureless mediocrity. To ascribe the deficiencies, such as they
-P-A-G-E-244
  
222 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
are, of art and culture in America, solely or even mainly to her 
form of government, is not less absurd than to ascribe, as many 
Americans of what I may call the trumpeting school do, her 
marvelous material progress to the same cause. It is not 
Democracy that has paid off a gigantic debt and raised Chicago 
out of a swamp. Neither is it Democracy that has denied her 
philosophers like Burke and poets like Wordsworth. 
Most writers who have dealt with these matters have not only 
laid more upon the shoulders of democratic government than it 
ought to bear, but have preferred abstract speculations to the 
humbler task of ascertaining and weighing the facts. They have 
spun ingenious theories about democracy as the source of this or 
that, or whatever it pleased them to assume; they have not tried 
to determine by a wide induction what specific results appear in 
countries which, differing in other respects, agree in being demo- 
cratically governed. If I do not follow these time-honored 
precedents, it is not because the process is difficult, but because 
it is unprofitable. These speculations have perhaps had their 
use in suggesting to us what phenomena we ought to look for in 
democratic countries; but if any positive results are to be 
reached, they must be reached by carefully verifying the intel- 
lectual phenomena of more than one country, and establishing an 
unmistakable relation between them and the political institu- 
tions under which they prevail. 
If some one, starting from the current conception of democ- 
tracy, were to say that in a democratic nation we should find a 
disposition to bold and unbridled speculations, sparing neither 
theology nor morals, a total absence of rule, tradition, and pre- 
cedent, each man thinking and writing as responsible to no crit- 
icism, “every poet his own Aristotle,” a taste for strong effects 
and garish colors, valuing force rather than fineness, grandeur 
rather than beauty, a vigorous, hasty, impetuous style of speak- 
ing and writing, a grandiose, and perhaps sensational art: he 
would say what would be quite as natural.and reasonable a priori 
as most of the pictures given us of democratic societies. Yet 
many of the suggested features would be the opposite of those 
which America presents.
-P-A-G-E-245
   INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 223 
Every such picture must be fanciful. He who starts from so 
simple and (so to speak) bare a conception as that of equal civil 
rights and equal political powers vested in every member of the 
community cannot but have recourse to his fancy in trying to 
body forth the results of this principle. Let anyone study 
the portrait of the democratic man and democratic city which the 
first and greatest of all the hostile critics of democracy has left 
us,! and compare it with the very different descriptions of life 
and culture under a popular. government in which European 
speculation has disported itself since De Tocqueville’s time. He 
will find each theory plausible in the abstract, and each equally 
unlike the facts which contemporary America sets before us. 
Let us then bid farewell to fancy and endeavor to discover 
what are now the salient intellectual features of the mass of the 
native population in the. United States. 
As there is much difference of opinion regarding them, I pre- 
sent with diffidence the following list:— 
1. A desire to be abreast of the best thought and work of the 
world everywhere, to have every form of literature and art ade- 
quately represented, and excellent of its kind, so that America 
shall be felt to hold her own among the nations. 
2. A fondness for bold and striking effects, a preference for 
large generalizations and theories which have an air of complete- 
ness. 
3. An absence among the multitude of refined taste, and dis- 
position to be attracted rather by general brilliance than by 
delicacy of workmanship; a want of mellowness and inadequate 
perception of the difference between first-rate work in a quiet 
style and mere flatness. 
4. Little respect for canons or traditions, accompanied by the 
notion that new conditions must of necessity produce new ideas. 
5. An undervaluing of special knowledge or experience, ex- 
cept perhaps in the sphere of applied science and commerce, an 
1 Plato indeed indulges his fancy so far as to describe the very mules and asses of a democ- 
racy as prancing along the roads, scarcely deigning to bear their burdens. The passion for 
unrestrained license, for novelty, for variety, is to him the note of democracy, whereas monot- 
ony and even obstinate conservatism are the faults which the latest European critics bid 
us expect. [Author’s note.] e 
     
                                         
-P-A-G-E-246
  224 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
idea that an able man can do one thing pretty much as well as 
another, as Dr. Johnson thought that if he had taken to poli- 
tics he would have been as distinguished therein as he was in 
poetry. 
6. An admiration for literary or scientific eminence, an en- 
thusiasm for anything that can be called genius, with an over- 
readiness to discover it. 
7. A love of intellectual novelties. 
8. An intellectual impatience, and desire for quick and patent 
results. 
9. An over-valuing of the judgments of the multitude; a dis- 
position to judge by “success” work which has not been pro- 
duced for the sake of success. 
to. A tendency to mistake bigness for greatness. 
Contrariwise, if we regard not the people generally but the 
most cultivated class, we shall find, together with some of the 
above-mentioned qualities, others which indicate a reaction 
against the popular tendencies. This class has a strong relish 
for subtlety of thought and highly finished art, whether in 
literature or painting. It is so much afraid of crudity and 
vagueness as to be prone to devote itself to minute and careful 
study of subjects unattractive to the masses. 
Of these characteristics of the people at large some may at 
first sight seem inconsistent with others, as for instance the ad- 
miration for intellectual gifts with the under-valuing of special 
knowledge; nevertheless it could be shown that both are dis- 
coverable in Americans as compared with Englishmen. The 
former admire intelligence more than the latter do: but they 
defer less to special competence. However, assuming for the 
moment that there is something true in these suggestions, which 
it would take too long to attempt to establish one by one, be it 
observed that very few of them can be directly connected with 
democratic government. Even these few might take a different 
form in a differently situated democracy. The seventh and 
eighth seem due to the general intelligence and education of the 
people, while the remainder, though not wholly uninfluenced by 
the habits which popular government tends to breed, must] be 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 223 
mainly ascribed to the vast size of the country, the vast 
numbers and homogeneity of its native white population, the 
prevalence of social equality, a busy industrialism, a restless 
changefulness of occupation, and the absence of a leisured class 
dominant in matters of taste—conditions that have little or 
nothing to do with political institutions. The prevalence of 
evangelical Protestantism has been quite as important a factor 
in the intellectual life of the nation as its form of government. 
Some one may say—I wish to state the view fairly though I 
do not entirely agree with it—that assuming the foregoing 
analysis to be correct, the influence of democracy, apart from 
its tendency to secure an ample provision of education, is dis- 
cernible in two points. It produces self-confidence and self- 
complacency, national and personal, with the result both of 
stimulating a certain amount of thought and of preventing the 
thought that is so produced from being subjected to proper tests. 
Ambition and self-esteem will call out what might have lain 
dormant, but they will hinder a nation as well as a man from 
duly judging its own work, and in so far will retard its progress. 
Those who are naturally led to trust and obey common sense 
and the numerical majority in matters of state, over-value the 
judgment of the majority in other matters. Now the judgment 
of the masses is a poor standard for the thinker or the artist to 
set before him. It may narrow his view and debase his style. 
He fears to tread in new paths or express unpopular opinions; 
or if he despises the multitude he may take refuge in an acrid 
cynicism. Where the masses rule, a writer cannot but think of 
the masses, and as they do not appreciate refinements he will 
eschew these, making himself at all hazards intelligible to the 
common mind, and seeking to attract by broad, perhaps coarsely 
broad, effects, the hasty reader, who at the circulating libraries 
passes by Walter Scott or Thackeray to fasten on the latest 
sketch of fashionable life or mysterious crime. 
I do not deny that there is some force in this way of putting 
the case. Democracy tends to produce a superficially active 
public and perhaps also a jubilant and self-confident public. But 
it is quite possible to have a democratic people which shall    
-P-A-G-E-248
  226 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
be neither fond of letters nor disposed to trust its own judg- 
ment and taste in judging them. Much will depend on the 
other features of the situation. In the United States the culti- 
vated public increases rapidly, and the very reaction which goes 
on within it against the defects of the multitude becomes an 
important factor. All things considered, I doubt whether 
democracy tends to discourage originality, subtlety, refinement, 
in thought and in expression, whether literary or artistic. I 
doubt if there be any solid ground for expecting monotony or 
vulgarity under one form of government more than another. 
The causes lie deeper. Art and literature have before now been 
base and vulgar under absolute monarchies and under oligarchies. 
One of the most polished and aristocratic societies in Europe has 
for two centuries been that of Vienna; yet what society could 
have been intellectually duller or less productive? Moreover, it 
must not be forgotten that the habits of popular government 
which open a career to talent in public life, open it in literature 
also. No man need lean on a faction or propitiate a coterie. 
A pure clear voice with an unwonted message may at first fail to 
make itself heard over the din of competitors for popular favor; 
but once heard, it and its message will probably be judged on 
their own merits. 
Passing away from this question as to the supposed narcotic 
power of democracy, the further question may be asked, what is 
the distinctive note of democratic thought and art as they actual- 
ly appear in the United States? What is the peculiar quality or 
flavor which springs from this political element in their con- 
dition? I cannot tell. I find no such note. I have searched 
for it, and, as the Americans say, it is hard work looking for 
what is not there. Some Europeans and many Americans pro- 
fess to have found it, and will tell you that this or that peculi- 
arity of American literature is due to democracy. No doubt, if 
you take individual writers, you may discover in several of them 
something, though not always the same thing, which savors of 
democratic feeling and tinges their way of regarding human life. 
But that is not enough. What must be shown is a general 
quality running through the majority of these writers—a
-P-A-G-E-249
INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 227 
quality which is at once recognized as racy of the soil, and which 
can be traced back to the democratic element which the soil 
undoubtedly contains. No such: quality seems to have been 
shown. That there is a distinctive note in many—not, perhaps, 
in all—of the best American books may be admitted. It may 
be caught by ears not the most delicate. But is this note the 
voice of democracy? Is it even the voice of democracy and 
equality combined? There isa difference, slight yet perceptible, 
in the part which both sentiment and humor play in American 
books, when we compare them with English books of equivalent 
strength. The humor has a vein of oddity, and the contrast 
between the soft copiousness of the sentiment and the rigid lines 
of lingering Puritanism which it suffuses, is rarely met with in 
England. Perhaps there is less repose in the American style; 
there is certainly a curious unrestfulness in the effort, less 
common in English writers, to bend metaphors to unwonted uses. 
But are these differences, with others I might mention—and, 
after all, they are slight—due to any cause connected with 
politics? Are they not rather due to a mixed and curiously 
intertwined variety of other causes which have molded the 
American mind during the last two centuries? American 
imagination has produced nothing more conspicuously original 
than the romances of Hawthorne. If anyone says that he finds 
something in them which he remembers in no previous English 
writer, we know what is meant and probably agree. But can it 
be said that there is anything distinctively American in Haw- 
thorne, that is to say, that his specific quality is of a kind which 
reappears in other American writers? Few will affirm this. 
The most peculiar, and therefore I suppose the most character- 
istically American school of thought, has been what used to be 
called the Concord or Transcendental school of forty years 
ago; among the writings produced by which those of Emerson 
are best known in Europe. Were the authors of that school 
distinctively democratic either in the color of their thought, or 
in its direction, or in the style which expresses it? And if so, 
can the same democratic tinge be discerned in the authors of 
to-day? I doubt it: but such matters do not admit of proof or
-P-A-G-E-250
  e 
228 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
disproof. One must leave them to the literary feeling of the 
reader. 
A very distinguished American man of letters once said to 
me that he hated nothing so much as to hear people talk about 
American literature. He meant, I think, that those who did so 
were puzzling themselves unnecessarily to find something which 
belonged to a new country, and a democratic country, and were 
forgetting or ignoring the natural relation of works of imagina- 
tion and thought produced in America to books written by men 
of the same race in the Old World before and since 1776. 
So far, then, as regards American literature generally, I do not 
believe that there is in it anything specifically democratic. Nor 
if we look at the various departments of speculative thought, 
such as metaphysics and theology, or at those which approach 
nearer to-the exact sciences, such as economics and jurisprudence, 
shall we find that the character and substance of the doctrines 
propounded bear marked traces of a democratic influence. Why 
should we be surprised at this, seeing that the influence of a form 
of government is only one among many influences, even where a 
nation stands alone, and creates a literature distinctively local? 
But can books written in the United States be deemed to con- 
stitute a literature locally American in the same sense as the 
literatures of France and Germany, of Italy and Russia, 
belong to those countries? For the purposes of thought and 
art the United States is a part of England, and England is a 
part of America. Many English books are more widely read 
and strike deeper to the heart in America than in England. 
Some American books have a like fortune in England. Differ- 
ences there are, but differences how trivial compared with the 
resemblances in temper, in feeling, in susceptibility to certain 
forms of moral and physical beauty, in the general view of life 
and nature, in the disposition to revere and be swayed by the 
same matchless models of that elder literature which both 
branches of the English race can equally claim. American lit- 
erature does not to-day differ more from English literature than 
the Scottish writers of eighty or a hundred years ago—Burns, 
Scott, Adam Smith, Reid, Hume, Robertson—differed from]
-P-A-G-E-251
INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 229 
their English contemporaries. There was a fondness for ab- 
stractions and generalizations in the Scottish prose writers; there 
was in the Scottish poets a bloom and fragrance of mountain 
heather which gave to their work a charm of freshness and sin- 
gularity, like that which a faint touch of local accent gives to the 
tongue of an orator. But they were English as well as Scottish 
writers: they belong to English literature and make part of its 
glory to the world beyond. So Fenimore Cooper, Hawthorne, 
Emerson, Longfellow, and those on whom their mantle has fallen, 
belong to England as well as to America; and English writers, 
as they more and more realize the vastness of the American 
public they address, will more and more feel themselves to be 
American as well as English, and will often find in America not 
only a larger but a more responsive audience. 
We have been here concerned not to discuss the merits and 
estimate the place of American thinkers and writers, but only to 
examine the relation in which they stand to their political and 
social environment. That relation, however, sets before us one 
more question. The English-speaking population of the United 
States is one-third larger than that of the United Kingdom. 
It is a more educated population, in which a greater number of 
persons come under the influence of books and might therefore, 
be stirred up to intellectual production. Why then does it not 
make more important contributions to the common literary 
wealth of the race? Is there a want of creative power? and if 
so, to what is the want due? 
This is a question frequently propounded. I propose to 
consider it in the chapter which follows.

There is a street in Florence on each side of which stand statues 
of the famous Florentines of the fourteenth and fifteenth cen- 
turies,—Dante, Giotto, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Ghiberti, Machia- 
velli, Michael Angelo, and others scarcely less illustrious, all 
natives of the little city which in their days had never a pop- 
ulation of more than sixty thousand souls.2_ No one can walk 
between these rows of world-famous figures, matched by no other 
city of the modern world, without asking himself what cause 
determined so much of the highest genius to this one spot; why 
in Italy herself populous Milan and Naples and Venice have no 
such list to show; why the succession of greatness stopped with 
the beginning of the sixteenth century and has never been re- 
sumed? Questions substantially the same constantly rise to the 
mind in reading the history of other countries. Why did Eng- 
land produce no first-rate poet in the two stirring centuries 
between Chaucer and Shakespeare, and again in the century 
and a half between Milton’s birth and Wordsworth’s? Why 
have epochs of comparative sterility more than once fallen upon 
Germany and France? and why has music sometimes reached its 
highest pitch of excellence at moments when the other arts were 
languishing? Why does the scepter of intellectual and artistic 
leadership pass now to one great nation, now to another, incon- 
stant and unpredictable as are the shifting winds? 
These questions touch the deepest and most complex prob- 
lems of history; and neither historian nor physiologist has yet 
been able to throw any real light upon them. Even the com- 
monplace remark that times of effort and struggle tend to

develop an unusually active’ intellectual movement and there- 
with to awaken or nourish rare geniuses, is not altogether true; 
for some of the geniuses have arisen at moments when there 
was no excitement to call them forth, and at other times seasons 
of storm and stress have raised up no one capable of directing 
the efforts or interpreting the feelings of his generation. One 
thing, however, is palpable: numbers have nothing to do with 
the matter. There is no average of a man of genius to so many 
thousands or millions of persons. Out of the sixty thousand of 
Florence there arise during two centuries more men of un- 
dying fame than out of huge London during the last three 
centuries. Even the stock of solid second-class ability does not 
necessarily increase with increasing numbers; while as to 
those rare combinations of gifts which produce poetry or 
philosophy of the first order, they are revealed no more fre- 
quently in a great European nation now than they were in a 
Semitic tribe or a tiny Greek city twenty-five or thirty 
centuries ago. 
There is therefore no reason why the absence of brilliant 
genius among the sixty millions in the United States should 
excite any surprise; we might as well wonder that there is no 
Goethe, or Schiller or Kant or Hegel in the Germany of to-day, 
so much more populous and better educated than the Germany 
of their birth-time. It is not to be made a reproach against 
America that men like Tennyson or Darwin have not been born 
there. “The wind bloweth where it listeth;” the rarest gifts 
appear no one can tell why or how. In broad France a century 
ago no man was found able to spring upon the neck of the 
Revolution and turn it to his will. Fate brought her favorite 
from a wild Italian island, that had but just passed under the 
yoke of the nation to which it gave a master. 
The question we have to ask as regards the United States is 
therefore not why it has given us few men of the highest and 
rarest distinction, but whether it has failed to produce its fair 
share of talents of the second rank, that is, of men capable of 
taking a lead in all the great branches of literary or artistic or 
scientific activity, men who instruct and delight their own

meditate again. He must be able to set his creation aside, and 
return to it after days or weeks to look at it with fresh eyes. 
He must be neither distracted from his main purpose, nor hur- 
ried in effecting it. He must be able to concentrate the whole 
force of his reason or imagination on one subject, to abstract 
himself when needful from the flitting sights and many-voiced 
clamor of the outer world. Juvenal said this long ago about 
the poet; it also applies, though possibly in a lower degree, both 
to the artist and to the serious thinker, or delicate workman, in 
any field of literature, to the metaphysician, the theologian, the 
philosophic historian, the economist, the philologist, even the 
novelist and the statesman. I have heard men who had gone 
from a quiet life into politics complain that they found their 
thinking powers wither, and that while they became far more 
expert in getting up subjects and speaking forcibly and plaus- 
ibly, they found it harder and harder to form sound general 
views and penetrate beneath the superficialities of the news- 
paper and the platform. Interrupted thought, trains of reflec- 
tion or imaginative conceptions constantly broken by a variety 
lof petty transient calls of business, claims of society, matters 
assing in the world to note and think of, not only tire the mind 
ut destroy its chances of attaining just and deep views of life

voods around it. Mohammed falling into trances on the moun-

them the full stream of his powers to the exclusion of whatever 
could break or divert its force. 
In Europe men call this a century of unrest. But the United 
States is more unrestful than Europe, more unrestful than any 
country we know-of has yet been. Nearly every one is busy; 
those few who have not to earn their living and do not feel 
called to serve their countrymen, find themselves out of place, 
and have been wont either to make amusement into a business 
or to transfer themselves to the ease of France or Italy. The 
earning of one’s living is not, indeed, incompatible with intel- 
lectually creative work, for many of those who have done such 
work best have done it in addition to their gainful occupation, 
or have earned their living by it. But in America it is unusually 
hard for anyone to withdraw his mind from the endless variety 
of external impressions and interests which daily life presents, 
and which impinge upon the mind, I will not say to vex it, but 
to keep it constantly vibrating to their touch. Life is that of 
the squirrel in his revolving cage, never still even when it does 
not seem to change. It becomes every day more and more so 
in England, and English literature and art show increasing 
marks of haste. In the United States the ceaseless stir and 
movement, the constant presence of newspapers, the eagerness 
which looks through every pair of eyes, even that active in- 
telligence and sense of public duty, strongest in the best minds, 
which make a citizen feel that he ought to know what is passing] 
in the wider world as well as in his own, all these render lit 
more exciting to the average man than it is in Europe; bu 
chase away from it the opportunities for repose and medita: 
tion which art and philosophy need, as growing plants nee

   gions of the country, where the pulsations of life are slower 
and steadier than in the West or in the great commercial cities. 
It. is from New England that nearly all the best books of the 
last generation came; and that not solely because the English 
race has been purest there, and education most generally 
diffused, for the New Englanders who have gone West, though 
they have carried with them their moral standard and their 
bright intelligence, seem either to have left behind their gift 
for literary creation, or to care to employ it only in teaching 
and in journalism. 
It may be objected to this view that some of the great lit- 
erary ages, such as the Periclean age at Athens, the Medicean 
age at Florence, the age of Elizabeth in England, have been ages 
full of movement and excitement. But the unrestfulness which 
prevails in America is altogether different from the large variety 
of life, the flow of stimulating ideas and impressions which 
marked those ages. Life is not as interesting in America, except 
as regards commercial speculation, as it is in Europe; because 
society and the environment of man are too uniform. It is 
hurried and bustling; it is filled with a multitude of duties and 
occupations and transient impressions. In the ages I have re- 
ferred to men had time enough for all there was to do, and the 
very scantiness of literature and rarity of news made that 
which was read and received tell more powerfully upon the im- 
lagination. 
Nor is it only the distractions of American life that clog the 
ings of invention. The atmosphere is overfull of all that 
ertains to material progress. Americans themselves say, when 
xcusing the comparative poverty of learning and science, that 
heir chief occupation is at present the subjugation of their con- 
inent, that it is an occupation large enough to demand most of 
he energy and ambition of the nation, but that presently, when 
his work is done, the same energy and ambition will win similar 
riumphs in the fields of abstract thought, while the gifts which 
ow make them the first nation in the world for practical inven- 
ions, will then assure to them a like place in scientific discovery. 
here is evidently much truth ini this. The attractions of prac-
-P-A-G-E-258
236 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS -AND PROBLEMS 
tical life are so great to men conscious of their own vigor, the 
development of the West and the vast operations of commerce 
and finance which have accompanied that development have 
absorbed so many strenuous talents, that the supply of ability 
available not only for pure science (apart from its applications) 
and for philosophical and historical studies, but even for states- 
manship, has been proportionately reduced. But, besides this | 
withdrawal of an unusually large part of the nation’s force, the 
predominance of material and practical interests has turned 
men’s thoughts and conversation into a channel unfavorable to 
the growth of the higher and more solid kinds of literature, per- 
haps still more unfavorable to art. Goethe said, apropos of the 
good work produced by such men as Ampére and Merimée at a 
very early age, “If a talent is to be speedily and happily devel- 
oped the chief point is that a great deal of intellect and sound cul-| 
ture should be current in a nation.” There is certainly a great 
deal of intellect current in the United States. But it is chiefl 
. directed to business, that is, to railways, to finance, to commerce. 
to inventions, to manufactures (as well as to practical profession: 
like law), things which play a relatively larger part than i 
Europe, as subjects of universal attention and discussion. Ther 
is abundance of sound culture, but it is so scattered about i 
divers places and among small groups which seldom meet on 
another, that no large cultured society has arisen similar to tha 
of European capitals or to that which her universities hay 
created for Germany. In Boston twenty years ago a host coul 
have brought together round his table nine men as interestin| 
and cultivated as Paris or London would have furnished. B 
a similar party of eighteen could not have been collected, n 
perhaps even the nine, anywhere except in Boston. At presen} 
culture is more diffused: there are many cities where men 
high attainments and keen intellectual interests are found, a: 
associate themselves in literary or scientific clubs. Societies f 
the study of particular authors are not uncommon amo: 
women. I remember to have been told of a Homer club and 
éschylus club, formed by the ladies of St. Louis, and of a Dan 
club in some Eastern city. Nevertheless a young talent gai

less than it would gain in Europe from the surroundings into 
which it is born. The atmosphere is not charged with ideas 
as in Germany, nor with critical finesse as in France. Stimulative 
it is, but the stimulus drives eager youth away from the groves 
of the Muses into the struggling throng cf the market- 
place. 
It may be thought fanciful to add that in a new country one 
whole set of objects which appeal to the imagination are absent, 
—no castles gray with age; no solemn cathedrals whose altering 
styles of architecture carry the mind up or down the long stream 
of history from the eleventh to the seventeenth century; few 
spots or edifices consecrated by memories of famous men or 
deeds, and among these none of remote date. There is certainly 
no want of interest in those few spots: the warmth with which 
Americans cherish them puts to shame the indifference of the 
English Parliament to the historic and prehistoric sites and 
buildings of Britain. But not one American youth in a thousand 
comes under the spell of any such associations. In the city or 
State where he lives there is nothing to call him away from the 
present. All he sees is new, and has no glories to set before 
him save those of accumulated wealth and industry skillfully 
applied to severely practical ends. 
Some one may say that if (as was observed in last chapter) 
English and American literature are practically one, there is no 
need to explain the fact that one part of a race undivided for 
literary purposes leaves the bulk of literary production to be 
done by the other part, seeing that it can enter freely into the 
labors of the latter and reckon them its own. To argue thus 
would be to push the doctrine of the unity of the two branches 
rather too far, for after all there is much in American conditions 
and life which needs its special literary and artistic interpreta- 
tions; and the question would still confront us, why the trans- 
atlantic branch, nowise inferior in mental force, contributes less 
than its share to the common stock. Still it is certainly true 
that the existence of a great body of producers, in England of 
literature, as in France of pictures, diminishes the need for pro- 
duction in America. Or to put the same thing in another way, 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  238 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
if the Americans did not speak English they would evidently 
feel called on to create more high literature for themselves. 
Many books which America might produce are not produced 
because the men qualified to write them know that there are 
already English books on the same subject; and the higher such 
men’s standard is, the more apt are they to overrate the advan- 
tages which English authors enjoy as compared with themselves. 
Many feelings and ideas which now find adequate expression 
through the English books which Americans read would then 
have to be expressed through American books, and their litera- 
ture would be not only more individual, but more copious and 
energetic. If it lost in breadth, it would gain in freshness and 
independence. American authors conceive that even the non- 
recognition of international copyright has told for evil on their 
profession. Since the native writer has been undersold by 
reprints of English and French books, which, paying nothing 
to the European author, can be published at the cost of the 
paper and printing only, native authorship is discouraged, 
native talent diverted into other fields, while at the same time 
the intellectual standard of the public is lowered and its taste 
vulgarized. It might be thought that the profusion of cheap 
reprints would tend to quicken thought and diffuse the higher 
kinds of knowledge among the masses. But experience proves 
that by far the largest part of these reprints, and the part 
which is most extensively read, are novels, and among them 
many flimsy novels, which drive better books, including some 
of the vast American fiction, out of the market, and tend to 
Europeanize the American mind in the worst way. One may 
smile at the suggestion that the allegiance ‘of the working 
classes to their democratic institutions will be seduced by de 
scriptions of English duchesses;' yet it is probably true—emi 
nent observers assure one of it—that the profusion of ne 
frothy or highly spiced fiction offered at fivepence or tenpenci 
a volume tends to spoil the popular palate for the enjoymen 
of more wholesome and nutritious food. And if it injures th 
higher literature by diminishing the demand, it may furthe 
1T have seen this argument advanced. [Author’s note.] 
 
-P-A-G-E-261

injure it by creating an atmosphere unfavorable to the growth 
of pure and earnest native literary talent. 
What then of the newspapers? The newspapers are too 
large a subject for this chapter, and their influence as organs of 
opinion has been already discussed. The vigor and brightness 
of many among them are surprising. Nothing escapes them: 
everything is set in the sharpest, clearest light. Their want of 
reticence and delicacy is regretfully admitted by all educated 
Americans—the editors, I think, included. The cause of this 
deficiency is probably to be found in the fact that, whereas 
the first European journals were written for the polite world 
of large cities, American journals were, early in their career, if 
not at its very beginning, written for the bulk of the people, 
and published in communities still so small that everybody’s 
concerns were already pretty well known to everybody else. 
They had attained no high level of literary excellence when 
some forty years ago an enterprising man of unrefined taste 
created a new type of “live” newspaper, which made a rapid 
success by its smartness, copiousness, and variety, while ad- 
dressing itself entirely to the multitude. Other papers were 
almost forced to shape themselves on the same lines, because the 
class which desired something more choice was still relatively 
small; and now the journals of the chief cities have become such 
vast commercial concerns that they still think first of the mass 
and are controlled by its tastes, which they have themselves 
done so much to create. There are cities where the more refined 
readers who dislike flippant personalities are counted by tens of 
thousands, but in such cities competition is now too severe to 
hold out much prospect of success to a paper which does not 
expect the support of hundreds of thousands. It is not, how- 
ever, with the esthetic or moral view of the newspaper that we 
are here concerned, but with the effect on the national mind of 
the enormous ratio which the reading of newspapers bears to all 
other reading, a ratio higher than even in France or England. 
A famous Englishman, himself a powerful and fertile thinker, 
contrasted the value of the history of Thucydides with that of 
a single number of the Times newspaper, greatly to the advan-
-P-A-G-E-262
  240 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
tage of the latter. Others may conceive that a thoughtful study 
of Thucydides, or, not to go beyond our own tongue, of Bacon, 
Milton, Locke, or Burke, perhaps even of Gibbon, Grote, or 
Macaulay, will do more to give keenness to the eye and strength 
to the wings of the mind than a whole year’s reading of the best 
daily newspaper. It is not merely that the matter is of more 
permanent and intrinsic worth, nor that the manner and style 
form the student’s taste; it is not merely that in the newspaper 
we are in contact with persons like ourselves, in the other case 
with rare and splendid intellects. The whole attitude of the 
reader is different. His attention is loose, his mind unbraced, 
so that he does not stop to scrutinize an argument, and forgets 
even valuable facts as quickly as he has learned them. If he read 
Burke as he reads the newspaper, Burke would do him little 
good. And therefore the habit of mind produced by a diet largely 
composed of newspapers is adverse to solid thinking and dulling 
to the sense of beauty. Scorched and stony is the soil which 
newspaper reading has prepared to receive the seeds of genius. 
Does the modern world really gain, so far as creative thought 
is concerned, by the profusion of cheap literature? It is a 
question one often asks in watching the passengers on an 
American railway. A boy walks up and down the car scattering 
newspapers and books in paper covers right and left as he goes. 
The newspapers are glanced at, though probably most people 
have read several of the day’s papers already. The books are 
nearly all novels. They are not bad in tone, and sometimes they 
give incidentally a superficial knowledge of things outside the 
personal experience of the reader; while from their newspapers 
the passengers draw a stock of information far beyond that of a 
European peasant, or even of an average European artisan. 
Yet one feels that this constant succession of transient ideas, 
none of them impressively though many of them startlingly 
stated, all of them flitting swiftly past the mental sight as the 
trees flit past the eyes when one looks out of the car window, 
is no more favorable to the development of serious intellectual 
interests and creative intellectual power than is the limited 
knowledge of the European artisan,
-P-A-G-E-263
  
INTELLECTUAL IDEALS 241 
Most of the reasons I have hazarded to account for a phe- 
nomenon surprising to one who recognizes the quantity of 
intellect current in America, and the diffusion, far more general 
than in any other country, of intellectual curiosity, are reasons 
valid in the Europe of to-day as compared with the Europe of 
last century, and still more true of the modern world as com- 
pared with the best periods of the ancient. Printing is by no 
means a pure gain to the creative faculties, whatever it may be to 
the acquisitive; even as a great ancient thinker seems to have 
thought that the invention of writing in Egypt had weakened 
the reflective powers of man. The question follows, Are 
these causes, supposing them to be true causes, likely to be 
more or less operative in the America of next century than they 
now are? Will America become more what Europe is ‘now, or 
will she be even more American? 
I have elsewhere thrown out some conjectures on this point. 
Meantime it is pertinent to ask what are the most recent 
developments of American thought and research, for this will 
help us to see whether the tide of productive endeavor is rising 
or falling. 
The abundant and excellent work done in fiction need be 
mentioned only for the sake of calling attention to the interest 
it has, over and above its artistic merit, as a record of the local 
manners and usages and types of character in various parts of the 
Union—types which are fast disappearing. The Creoles of 
Louisiana, the negroes under slavery, with African tales still 
surviving in their memories, the rough but kindly backwoodsmen 
of Indiana forty years ago, the humors of the Mississippi steam- 
boat and the adventurous life of the Far West, are all known to 
Europe through the tales of writers now living, as the Indians of 
eighty years ago became known through the romances of 
Fenimore Cooper. However, this is familiar ground to Euro- 
pean readers, so I pass to work of a less generally attractive 
order. 
Thirty years ago the standard of classical scholarship was low, 
and even the school commentaries on classical authors fell far 
short of those produced in Germany or England. Nowadays
-P-A-G-E-264
  
242 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
both in classical and in Oriental philology admirably thorough 
and painstaking work is produced. I have heard high European 
authorities observe that there is an almost excessive anxiety 
among American scholars to master all that has been written, 
even by third-rate Germans, and that the desire they evince to 
overtake Germany in respect of knowledge betrays some among 
them into the German fault of neglecting merits of form and 
style. In the sciences of nature, especially in those of observa- 
tion, remarkable advances have been made. Dr. Asa Gray, 
whom the eldest American university has lately lost, was one of 
the two or three greatest botanists of his age. Much excellent 
work has been done in geology and paleontology, particularly in 
exploring the Rocky Mountain regions. Both for the excellence 
of their instruments and the accuracy of their observations, the 
astronomers stand in the front rank; nor do they fall behind 
Europe in the theoretical part of this science. In some branches 
of physics and chemistry, such as spectrum analysis, American 
investigators have won like fame. Competent authorities award 
the highest praise to their recent contributions to biology and to 
medical science. In economics they seem to stand before either 
England or France, both as regards the extent to which the 
subject is studied in universities and as regards the number of 
eminent persons whom it occupies. In jurisprudence and law, 
American text-books are quite as good as those produced in 
England;! and one author, the late Mr. Justice Story, deserves, 
looking to the quantity as well as to the quality of his work, to 
be placed at the head of all who have handled these topics in the 
English tongue during the last sixty years. Political science 
has begun to be studied more energetically than in England, 
where, to be sure, it is scarcely studied at all; and every year 
sees treatises and articles of permanent value added to the scanty 
modern literature which our language possesses on this subject. 
Similarly there is great activity in the field of both secular and 
ecclesiastical history, though as the work done has largely taken 
the direction of inquiries into the early history of institutions, 
1 The number of legal journals and magazines in the United States is very much larger than 
in England, and the average level of workmanship in them seems to be higher. [Author’s note.]

and has altogether been more in the nature of research than of 
treatises attractive to the general public, its quantity and its 
merits have not yet been duly appreciated even at home, much 
less in Europe. Indeed, it is remarkable how far from showy 
and sensational is the bulk of the work now done in America. 
It is mostly work of the German type, solid, careful, exact, not 
at all the sort of work which theorists about democracy would 
have looked for, since it appeals rather to the learned few than 
to the so-called general reader. One receives the impression that 
the class of intellectual workers, who until recently wanted insti- 
tutions in which the highest and fullest training could be had, 
have now become sensible that their country, occupied in devel- 
oping its resources and educating its ordinary citizens, had fallen 
behind Europe in learning and science, and that they are there- 
fore the more eager to accumulate knowledge and spend their 
energy in minutely laborious special studies. 
I may be reminded that neither in the departments above 
mentioned nor in statesmanship can one point to many brilliant 
personalities. The men whose names rise to the lips of a 
European are all advanced in life. Perhaps this is true of 
Europe also; perhaps the world has entered on an age of medi- 
ocrities. Some one lately said that there was now nobody in 
Paris, Berlin, or London under sixty years of age whom one 
would cross’ the street to look at. If this be so, it is not merely 
because length of years has given better chances of winning fame, 
for nearly all the men now famous in Europe had won fame 
before they were forty. There have been periods in history 
when striking figures were lacking, although great events seem 
to call for them. As regards America, if there be few persons 
of exceptional gifts, it is significant that the number of those 
who are engaged in scientific work, whether in the investigation 
of nature or in the moral, political, and historical sciences, is 
larger, relatively to the population of the country, than it was 
thirty years ago, the methods better, the work done more solid, 
the spirit more earnest and eager. Nothing more strikes a

recting readers to the books on each subject, seem to illustrate this tendency. [Author’s note ]

stranger who visits the American universities than the ardor with 
which the younger generation has thrown itself into study, even 
kinds of study which will never win the applause of the multi- 
tude. There is more zeal and heartiness among these men, 
more freshness of mind, more love of learning for its own sake, 
more willingness to forego the chances of fame and wealth for the 
sake of adding to the stock of human knowledge, than is to be 
found to-day in Oxford or Cambridge, or in the universities of 
Scotland. One is reminded of the scholars of the Renaissance 
flinging themselves into the study of rediscovered philology, or 
of the German universities after the War of Liberation. And 
under the impressions formed in mingling with such men, one 
learns to agree with the conviction of the Americans that for a 
nation so abounding in fervid force there is reserved a fruitful 
career in science and letters, no less than in whatever makes 
material prosperity.

One of the aspects of American life that must impress every 
foreigner visiting this country for the first time is the attention 
given to outdoor sports. Athletic meetings and sporting events 
are regularly reported in the daily newspapers ‘with a wealth 
of detail exceeding any other single department of news. The 
rivalry among cities, clubs, and schools is so keen that our main 
interest outside of business hours seems to be in some form of 
physical contest. Organized outdoor sports are recent devel- 
opments which have begun within the memory of men still 
young. They seem at first glance like a sudden reaction against 
former neglect of the body, but they are more logically a devel- 
opment of physical exercise into a newer and more artificial — 
form, and under changed conditions. 
Up to the close of the Civil War the need of physical training 
was not felt, and the stimulus to an outdoor life was supplied 
by the continual exploration of new ceuntry. All life was 
practically out of doors. Our people were scattered over a 
wide domain, and the centers of population were small. The 
great West to be explored and settled easily turned the thoughts

of a young man to his rifle, and to the Ae rc to be found 
in the forest. Sport was a child’s occupation by the side of the 
great game that he played. 
Colleges suffered from the effect of this drain of men of 
strength and initiative, who were more likely to turn away from 
books to seek their careers in the opening up of new territory 
and in the business connected with developing natural resources. 
The improvement in physical appearance of college boys 
generally is often ascribed to the physical training which is 
now common; but it might with as good reason be ascribed to 
the large infusion of the stronger type. The pale student no 
longer holds a monopoly in education. He is still with us, sur- 
rounded by so many of his sturdy companions that he is no 
longer typical of college life. The disappearance of the back- 
woods and the growth of large centers of population have thus 
created the demand for an artificial outlet; and the games are 
the natural successors of the youthful activities of a pioneer 
period. For boys in a large city far removed from open commit 
organized play is almost a necessity. 
What a foreigner would observe of the intensity of sports is 
only one manifestation of the spirit which American people 
now put into everything. The commercial growth of the past 
twenty years is probably equal to that of all the preceding years 
since the discovery of the continent. The energies of the entire 
nation have been turned into channels of trade and pleasure, 
and we are passing through a period of surprise and readjust- 
ments calculated to upset the nerves of any people. Many arts 
are being revolutionized. A machine has no time in the United 
States to wear out, before it is superseded by something thought 
to be better, and we are constantly hearing of inventions tlfat 
will wipe out entire industries. Our sudden leap into promi- 
nence as a commercial power has affected us like the discovery 
of a vast gold mine. The majority are engaged in the struggle 
for wealth, and most things are judged from a material stand- 
point. This condition was inevitable from the first, and it 
constitutes only a phase of American development which will 
pass away as the novelty wears off.

If in the craze for winning our sports exhibit the spirit and 
method of trade, it is because boys cannot escape from their 
environment into an atmosphere more ideal. The only place 
where we can hope to maintain the higher motive is in colleges 
and schools. There the young men are collectively under better 
control, and they are for a season removed from the competition 
of the outside world. Athletic sports have obtained a strong 
hold upon them, and the public is entirely familiar with the 
large number of games among students of different universities 
and colleges. Much has been said against the contests, and the 
opinion that they have been allowed to go too far is quite 
common. In discussing this subject, let us remember that boys 
and girls will carry to school the impulses and habits learned 
at home, and that society at large shares the responsibility for 
degraded sports. Youth is the natural time for play, and it 
is well to provide some wholesome method of working off 
superfluous animal spirits. Physical contests are probably 
the best; at any rate they are far ahead of billiards and 
horse-play. If, then, disagreeable extremes often spring 
from them, it does not follow that the ultimate result is 
. not the best that could be attained in the present state of 
society. 
/ While universities and colleges have become natural centers 
(v athletic contests, scholarship has seemed to lose its proper 
erspective. The appearance of thirty thousand people to see 
a’ football game, and the disappearance of all students from 
their classrooms during an entire day, would have filled a pro- 
fessor of the old school with despair. He would have looked 
upon it much as the general public now regard a prize fight or 
a bull fight. Many professors hold this view to-day, and a very 
respectable vote could be obtained in most college faculties 
against the severer forms of intercollegiate contests. It is not 
intended to imply that teachers are opposed to outdoor sports; 
but rather to some of the practices that seem to follow in their 
train. There are evils, and for the good of American students 
they ought to be stated without reserve. At the same time the 
subject should be approached without prejudice, as the adequate \
-P-A-G-E-270
  248 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
treatment of the physical side of college life is perhaps one of the 
most important questions now before educators. 
The old idea of education was that a youth could obtain ali 
the benefits of a college training from books. The value of a” 
sound body was recognized in theory, but in practice no syste-_ 
matic method of obtaining it seemed to be thought necessary.» 
-A college simply represented study and books. Education, 
crystallized along conventional lines, was confined mainly to 
men entering the professions of law, medicine, and divinity. 
Now all this is changed. The modern college is obliged. to = 
take into account the demands of commerce, and the applica 
tions of science to the well-being of man. Many of the ‘pro- 
fessions now require the higher education as a foundation, and 
the majority of subjects taught have been placed on “college 
catalogues within a few years. The dominating note underlying 
courses of study for undergraduate students is, before all else, 
the production of enlightened citizens. Physical vigor has 
therefore acquired a practical significance which it never had 
before. It is fast becoming as much a man’s duty to take 
proper care of his body as it is to cultivate his reason. Most 
colleges have been forced to provide the opportunity for some 
kind of physical training. 
The systematic culture of the body began in this country 
in a very small way, but its growth has been most rapid. Gym- 
nasiums, such as are now resorted to by many young people, 
fill a highly useful function. Unfortunately many colleges 
and universities lose a large part of the benefit accruing from 
them. Usually there is no recognition of the work done. Com- 
petent instructors are provided, and every opportunity is given 
to the students to benefit by their teaching, but everything is 
voluntary. Physical excellence does not in any way affect a 
student’s standing or help him to get his degree. This is a 
serious handicap to a gymnasium, as the exercises indoors are 
at best extremely monotonous and dull. It is only natural that 
a young man should want credit in the shape of marks, as for a- 
course of studies, when he has spent several hours a week during 
an entire year in manipulating weights for the good of his body. ,

ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 240 
Failing these or any other inducement in the gymnasium, he 
turns to outdoor sports, wherein success yields an immediate 
reiurn in the applause of his classmates and friends. This is 
where college faculties have been slow to recognize their oppor- 
tunities and duties. 
Outdoor sports were for many years left to regulate them-° 
selves in the hands of students without experience of life to 
guide them, and often under the influence of irresponsible 
persons to whom college contests represented nothing more 
. than the excitement to be found in a horse race or a professional 
baseball game. It was not sport for sport’s sake, but sport for 
the sake of beating somebody by fair means, or by political 
intrigue. The inevitable result was an intolerable condition 
which had to come under the correction of faculties whether 
they liked to take the time from their lectures or not. Their 
interference was resented at first by students and athletic 
graduates, and mutual confidence was practically destroyed. 
The difficulty was how to improve the contests without entirely 
prohibiting them. The enthusiastic promoters of the sports 
were rarely good advisers, and for some years college professors 
worked alone on a most troublesome problem. The prevailing 
notion that they belonged to a class living in the clouds did not 
increase respect for their opinions even when governed by reason 
and sound sense. In consequence progress has been slow. The 
spirit of sport is certainly much better as the newness has worn 
off, but much remains to be done. The first step was to make 
rules for the guidance of students in their intercollegiate rela- 
tions. Committees were necessary to that end, and as a rule 
representatives of the student body were called into consulta- 
tion. In most colleges these committees have remained to 
regulate the sports and to safeguard them against bad practices 
in the future. The rules commonly in force are similar in spirit, 
if not in substance, throughout the college world. They are 
simply records of experience relating to past abuses, as they 
have invariably been framed to cure some evil or to promote 
fairness. 
, There are only three rules that require comment here. The 
, 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
    
aso COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
first and most difficult of administration is in the nature of a 
definition of professionalism. The intention of this rule is to 
disqualify from participation in college sports all men who have 
received a money benefit or its equivalent by reason of their 
previous connection with athletics. It would be foolish to 
treat this as a moral question, although it does affect the honor 
of a team. The distinction between an amateur and a pro- 
fessional is one purely in the interest of sport, because the latter 
has presumably made more or less of an occupation of athletics, 
and therefore outclasses the former. Hence the contest wherein 
professionals are set against amateurs is unequal if the facts are 
known; unfair, if the facts are concealed. In either case the 
result is bad. A spirit of retaliation, absolutely fatal to friendly 
contests, is introduced. The rule was made at a time when 
abuses were common, and some of its provisions now seem too 
sweeping. The technicalities that arise are often absurd, yet 
the distinction between the two kinds of players had to be 
drawn, and the line was not a clear one under the best of circum- 
stances. On the whole, the rule has promoted honorable dealing 
between college boys, and its influence in the preparatory schools 
has been far reaching. It should not be modified in spirit 
except for very weighty reasons, although a greater latitude in 
its interpretation might be allowed to committees. 
There is no doubt that college boys often dishonor themselves 
consciously or unconsciously by concealing facts in relation to 
their standing as amateurs. Even older men are sometimes 
willing to degrade sports by deception. A letter was received 
at Harvard several years ago, informing the Athletic Committee 
that the services of a well-known athlete could be secured as 
coach, if he could be paid a stated sum in such a way that no 
evidence could be found against his amateur standing. The 
most common lapses among students occur in the summer in 
connection with baseball. Some of the men undoubtedly play 
on hotel and summer resort nines for a substantial gain. They 
know that they are cheapening themselves, but the practice 
continues with the concealment of the actual facts. There are 
various methods of receiving financial benefit without violating
-P-A-G-E-273
   ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 251 
the letter of the athletic rules. One of these is exhibited in a 
letter, by no means unique, received last spring by a first-rate 
college ball player. A few extracts are given below: 
“I write to ask if you know of a first-class pitcher that can be 
obtained for the summer, to pitch on the team of the 
League, a team that will be made up entirely of 
fast college players. Such a pitcher would be used most liber- 
ally here,—in fact, he could have almost anything he wanted, 
and he would be protected in the matter of privacy concerning 
any arrangement made. This is the best summer town on the 
coast, and clean baseball players will be taken into the best 
society here. Our players will come from ——, - , and 
other colleges. It is possible that you may know of one or two 
good men on the Harvard team who would like such an outing, 
which will cost them nothing from the time they leave home 
until they return there. If so, I shall consider it a great favor 
if you will write me about them. We must have a corking team 
this year and stand willing to plunge on a pitcher. The right 
man will find seventy-five monthly in his jeans, and he can 
wonder as much as he likes how it got there. Couldn’t you be 
induced to visit some friends who will be provided for you down 
this way?” 
Another rule requires all members of athletic teams to be 
genuine students of the college which they represent, and to 
be satisfactory in their studies. A student who is not promoted 
every year to a higher class, or is on probation for neglect of 
studies, is not allowed to play on any team. It does not follow 
from this that athletes as a class are good students. The eager 
desire to-play acts as a spur to many otherwise dull men, and 
some of them have been thus goaded into mental activity. The 
games are powerful incentives to some boys, and can be depended 
upon to keep them straight. In this respect their advantage to 
mental and physical discipline cannot be denied. Statistics 
on the scholarship of athletes are not conclusive. Allowance is 
rarely made for the fact that young men in bad standing are 
carefully weeded out of the teams, and that therefore comparison 
with all other students is unfair. It does not stand to reason   
    
    
    
       
        
   
              
    
-P-A-G-E-274
   
  252 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
  that a student in intercollegiate athletics can do as much work 
as one who devotes all his time to study. The athletic season of 
football, for example, lasts six weeks in the fall, and, so far as 
classroom work is concerned, the time is practically thrown 
away. The members of the team attend lectures regularly, 
they are obliged to; but their minds are on signals and plays for 
the next game or practice. As a consequence, one-fifth of the 
year is lost, and the players have to do as much work in the 
remaining four-fifths as others do in the five-fifths. With aver- 
age students it will not be done. The physical training which 
the football men have gone through cannot under favorable 
circumstances increase their efficiency enough to make good the 
difference. Then, as a rule, their participation in athletics has 
made them natural leaders in the social life of the college, and 
so they lose still more time. .The only point that may be re- 
garded as established by the records is that few students ad- 
mitted to the teams are subsequently thrown off for poor 
scholarship. This proves that most athletes can usually do 
enough work to remain satisfactory in their studies. Of late 
years a good player has lost caste if he permits himself to be 
disqualified through any fault of his own. 
The question of scholarship should not be approached in a 
narrow spirit. Do students gain anything in athletics that 
justifies the time taken from their studies? That is the vital 
consideration. While a definite and convincing answer cannot 
be given in all cases, it is safe to say that many do. It is a 
matter of common observation that athletes as a class have more 
initiative, and know better how to deal with men, than other 
students, especially when they first graduate. Whether they 
really hold their own in a long life is another matter. Much 
depends upon the individual. 
A third rule relates ‘to the procurement of good players from 
other colleges, by social or money inducements. To discourage 
this practice no ex-player of a college team is allowed to join the| 
team of another college until after he has been enrolled for one 
entire year. This has removed one cause of complaint, but a] 
real evil nevertheless remains. There is too much solicitatio 
     
   
    
     
     
        
-P-A-G-E-275
ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 253 
of boys in the preparatory schools with a view to the strengthen- 
ing of college teams. Agents are constantly on the lookout for 
good candidates. Let a boy exhibit any unusual ability as an 
athlete, and half a dozen colleges will be after him. Induce- 
ments are offered in the nature of social advantage or of sinecure 
positions, which carry with them substantial financial gains. 
Often good athletes or their friends set a value on their services, 
and solicit positions. An example of this is shown in the 
following extract from a letter lately received by the Athletic 
Committee at Harvard: - 
“T should like to call your attention to Mr. , who is 
thinking of entering college. We want to place him in some 
college where his athletic talents will be recognized and will be 
of use to him.” 
Then follows a list of his achievements, with a request to 
know what the university can do for him. College teams should 
be made up of men who come to them naturally, and the second- 
ary schoolboys should be freed from all forms of solicitation. 
They unsettle the judgment of both parents and boys. An 
extension of the one year rule to include all students from going 
into the intercollegiate games during their first year in college 
would be wholesome in its effects. 
The three rules mentioned form in the main the backbone 
of college regulation of athletics. There are other rules intended 
mainly to keep the contests within bounds, and to promote so 
far as possible a friendly relation between contestants, but, un- 
happily, many things cannot be reached by rules. Student 
tradition and public opinion when rightly directed are of greater 
value than even regulation, if the players can be made to feel 
them. Various abuses creep in from an intense desire to win, 
and every year brings its crop of tricks. One of these is found 
in coaching a team from outside after the men have gone on 
the field to play. When eleven young men appear on the foot- 
ball field, it is commonly understood that they are going to win 
or lose on their merits, and not with the assistance of some one 
on the side lines. Outside coaching is in this sense entirely 
wrong, and yet it is often done secretly. In most cases the orly  
-P-A-G-E-276
  254 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
justification pleaded by those guilty of it is that the other side 
does the same,—just as a corrupt politician would justify buying 
votes,—and that we have to resort to this method to enable the 
good to triumph. As a matter of fact, trickery is usually re- 
sorted to, not because the other side actually does it, but because 
some one suspects ‘that the other side is going to do it. In 
some cases he is wrong, in others he is right. The best that can 
be said for side line coaching in football, however, is that it 
belongs to that class of shady practices which lessen the interest’ 
in the game. 
Intercollegiate athletics seem at times to suffer from a kind 
of insanity which bids fair to ruin them by destroying the inter- 
est of people who like to see fair play. There is no reason why 
games should not be made to build up character, and to teach 
patience, grit, and courage; but, unfortunately, winning in 
these days is put above everything else. This I believe to be 
a mere fad that we can live down in course of time, for deep in 
every young man’s heart there is a love of fairness which per- 
mits him to be led into trickery only under the mistaken idea 
that it is justified as a last resort. No good business man in 
America can ever derive satisfaction over success achieved by 
sharp practice or dishonesty. This is the saving grace of the 
nation. The principal lessons that rules and tradition can 
teach are to play the games fairly without whining over the 
result, and to introduce no element prejudicial to the highest 
ideal of college life. 
There are several claims for intercollegiate sports. First, 
that they establish the physical vigor necessary to enable the 
mind to do its most effective work; second, that they stimulate 
outdoor exercise all over the country; third, that they form art 
atmosphere of temperance and moderation in living, and thus 
restrain students from excesses; fourth, that they teach self- 
.. control and fairness; fifth, that they bring the graduates and 
“ undergraduates of different universities together in bonds of 
friendship; sixth, that college loyalty is promoted. Let us 
examine these claims somewhat more in detail. 
At present all sports do serve as physical developers to a
-P-A-G-E-277
  
ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 255 
number of college students, but not equally. Some are better 
suited to the purpose than others. A moderate game which 
does not try the powers to the utmost, and which can be entered 
by anyone, is undoubtedly beneficial. Others, which involve 
a tremendous strain on the system and elaborate preparation 
continued over long periods, are of doubtful benefit. It is the 
daily exercise extending over years that builds up the physical 
strength, and keeps a man up to his highest mental powers. 
Regular sleep and moderate eating are even more important 
than exercise. For this reason the military schools are vastly 
superior to the ordinary colleges in the physical setting up of 
boys. The teams need very little special training at West 
Point and Annapolis, for the cadets are always in training. 
“They are kept busy during a four years’ course in which the 
body receives as much daily attention as the mind. Every 
afternoon has its drill, usually out of doors, and every evening 
finds the cadet in bed by ten o’clock. 
The sports most commonly found in colleges are football, 
baseball, track athletics, ice hockey, lacrosse, basket bal!, hand 
ball, cricket}*rowing, tennis, golf, fencing, and swimming. The 
first six usually end with graduation; the others may be con- 
tinued through life as opportunity offers. Three of them, 
football, rowing, and track athletics, demand at times an 
exhausting strain, which may leave behind it a permanent 
weakness in some part of the body. Statistics would be difficult 
to obtain, and the statement should be made with due reserva- 
tion; nevertheless, it stands to reason that no physical effort 
that leaves a man in a fainting condition can be of real benefit. 
All of us have seen men collapse in a boat, or after a hard foot 
race. It may be that this is generally due to poor preparation 
for the contest, and that better methods would remove all 
danger. Rowing and the track games are so improving and 
satisfactory to a large number of students that they could not   be given up without serious loss. Some modification of the ~ 
length of the course might make rowing less exhausting. Four 
miles does not seem any better than three miles in testing two 
crews, and it is usually the fourth mile that does all the damage.
-P-A-G-E-278
  256 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
Football stands in a class by itself. It attracts enormous 
crowds, and is more spectacular than anything else we have 
ever had in American colleges. This is considered by many to 
be one of the chief objections to it. In some respects it is 
superior to any other sport. The combinations, like those in 
war, are endless, and the same quality of mind is required to 
work them out. Then, while the element of the unexpected is 
-not lacking, games are seldom won by a. fluke. The best 
equipped team almost always wins. Yet, as at present played, 
it is doubtful if football ought to have a place on college grounds. 
The old idea of fun has long since passed away, and although the 
excitement of a great final contest still remains, the players 
cannot possibly enjoy the season of drudgery that leads up to it. 
T have heard students say that they cared little for the ordinary 
game. One young man told me that he loathed it, and that 
only the pressure of his friends, and an ambition to share in 
the glory of a winning team, carried him into it. 
There is always the risk of serious injury to the participants. 
No season passes without many of them being in the doctor’s 
hands for bruises, sprains, and broken or displaced bones 
Frequently in the heavier games players have to be carried otf 
the field sometimes unconscious. Often in stopping a play, the 
side on the defensive take chances with their own lives and 
with those of their opponents, justified only in certain profes- 
sions like fire protection, life-saving, sea-faring, and railroading. 
Another aspect of the game is that foul play cannot well be 
detected by an umpire, and, worse still, it often pays. 
It is a fact that modern life demands courage, and that foot- 
ball develops it; nevertheless it is foolish to risk life and limb 
in a game because it teaches physical courage. There are so 
many ways of learning courage, which is most often a matter 
of temperament, that we may well look around for some less 
dangerous method, unless the roughness of the game can be 
regulated out of it. This is by no means impossible. The 
steady improvement in spirit and the great reduction in the 
number of injuries promise much for the future. It is only 
fair to add that the advocates of the game seem to be fully
-P-A-G-E-279
ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 257 
warranted in claiming that injuries indicate lack of skill, and 
that proper training teaches a boy how to take care of himself 
on the field. The attitude assumed by most colleges that the 
game has merits which entitle it to further trial is perhaps 
justifiable; at any rate, it is the most practical. There is a 
mistaken idea that football is peculiarly fitted to train men for 
military service, and there is absolutely no evidence to justify 
it. Quick decision, courage, and ready resource are often called 
out in a game as in a campaign; but there is much more de- 
manded of a good soldi*r. The monotonous and regular per- 
formance of duty in the long delays between battles, and in the 
many years that happily intervene between wars, tests a man’s 
moral fiber more.than the charge across a bloody field. The 
bulk of a soldier’s or of a sailor’s work lies in the preparation 
for the thing he may be called upon to do, while the principal 
work of a team, and that for which they entered college, is 
neglected during the six weeks of the season. This is the proper 
point of view in considering the value of a training for war. 
As to the moral courage which is more frequently the badge 
of good citizenship than physical courage, that is about evenly 
distributed throughout the student body, with perhaps a slight 
advantage to the young man who is working hard for his edu- 
cation. 
It is difficult to make a clear case for intercollegiate athletics 
as a stimulus to outdoor sports. We may be confusing cause 
and effect, and it may be the craving for an outdoor life which 
has stimulated college sport. Without doubt, the great inter- 
collegiate games do appeal to the imagination of all small boys, 
and lead them away from mischief to baseball, football, and the 
track games. In this respect they are of unqualified good to 
every community. We see hundreds of boys at their games to- 
day where we saw only tens a generation ago. 
One of the chief objections to intercollegiate games is that at 
present they require only a handful of specially qualified men 
on the big teams, with a very large number of unqualified men 
sitting on the bleachers to watch them. Now, it is the latter 
class that most need physical training and that waste much   
 
-P-A-G-E-280
258 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
of their time in college. With the present rage for victory at 
almost any cost, sports cease to be all round developers, and 
teams are necessarily made up by a weeding process which pays 
little attention to any who are not physically able to stand 
the strain of a hard season. The sports cannot, therefore, be 
considered in a thoroughly healthy condition. Intercollegiate 
games ought to be the result of a great deal of competition 
wholly within each university, where every student should be 
encouraged to go out on the field an hour every day. 
No one can associate with the athletes of our large univer- 
sities without being struck with their general temperance and 
moderation. They commonly talk more about their sports 
than their studies, and they are sometimes too demonstrative; 
but in the essential things that go to make men of good physique 
they establish the fashion at college. In this respect alone, 
outdoor sports and intercollegiate games offset much of the 
trouble they cause. The presence of a large number of young 
men who are in training and who keep themselves in good con- 
dition has a wholesome effect upon every entering class. The 
practical disappearance of hazing may be fairly credited -to 
athletics as much as to faculty regulation. The upper class 
men would find it difficult to haze a possible candidate for a 
team. Another consideration is the atmosphere of democratic 
equality that prevails on the athletic field. 
That college sports promote self-control and fairness is quite 
evident in spite of occasional lapses. There has been a steady 
improvement in the spirit of the college youth during the past 
twenty years. After all it is only by experience in the actual 
conduct of affairs, such as those relating to sports, that young 
men learn fairness. The majority of them go to college un- 
formed, with experience only in what is proper in the home 
circle, but with no adequate notion of what is due to their 
fellow beings in the world at large. From this spring many of 
the errors into which they fall. A freshman often violates the 
spirit of ordinary courtesy and fairness in his sports, not because 
he is bad, but simply because he has never come into contact 
with other men in such a way as to show him what is really
-P-A-G-E-281
ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 259 
square. The games exert a very wholesome influence in this 
respect. “The cheerfulness with which the average student will 
suffer a penalty in a game, or will accept exclusion from a game, 
is proof that athletics teach self-control. When a young man 
says that he “did not make the team,” that is the whole story. 
There is very little whining about unfairness in the selection of 
a team or about the one-sidedness of the coach and captain. 
Ttsusually comes down to the statement, “I was not good enough 
to make it.” This kind of education is unqualifiedly good. 
Team play which means that the individual must give way 
to the needs of the society in which he is placed is a valuable 
antidote to the spirit of the age,—individual success at almost 
any cost. 
One feature of the games is particularly disagreeable to any- 
one not interested in either side. That is the organized cheer- 
ing. The home team always has the advantage, if there is 
any, as their friends are most numerously represented on the 
seats, and are well prepared to assist them by shouting at 
critical moments. They always cheer the good plays of their 
own side, and often the mistakes of the opposing side. Nothing 
could be more discourteous or unfair to visitors, and yet it 
seems impossible to make students understand this. The call 
that is regularly issued, ‘‘Come out and help the team,” carries 
with it the implication that they are willing to win by shouting 
and playing against a team that can only play. The amusing 
side of this is that students always complain of the organized 
attempt to rattle their own men when visiting other universi- 
ties. There is no possible objection to the cheers that spring 
naturally to a young man’s lips over a good play, and enthusiasm 
is a beautiful sight in a crowd of boys; but let the whole thing 
be natural and not pumped up. 
The friendships and memories associated with one’s college 
days become increasingly attractive as the years pass. A boy 
of fine temper and strong sympathy is always an influence, and 
there is no place where his true qualities may be discovered as 
they can be in a team. It is doubtful, however, if games be- 
tween two teams ameliorate college courtesies in any‘ great
-P-A-G-E-282
  260 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
degree. There is at present a prevailing atmosphere of sus- 
picion, and colleges are too often set at odds with one another 
by agame. This extends to the graduates and sometimes even 
to the faculties, and it is shocking to hear what one university 
will say about another when there is a difference of opinion 
upon some eligibility question. The newspapers are full of 
it. As a matter of fact, one athletic dispute can destroy for 
years the good will of two otherwise friendly colleges. We 
see so many cases of it that we may be pardoned some skepti- 
cism on the promotion of intercollegiate friendship by inter- 
collegiate games. When students and officers of one university 
point the finger of scorn at those of another, we may usually 
be sure that both are wrong, and that their games should be 
suppressed as common nuisances. We still have much to 
learn, and the effort to study the subject in conference of repre- 
sentatives from all universities is a movement in the right 
direction. 
The loyalty of college men is without doubt quickened by 
regular return to the alma mater to see the chief games; but it 
is not unfair to charge it with being the shouting kind of loyalty 
which does not yield adequate return. The great gifts to the 
universities rarely come from men who have been athletes, and 
not seldom from men who have never been to college. In 
some institutions, athletic teams are encouraged and inter- 
collegiate contests are deliberately promoted for advertising 
purposes. It is doubtful if the resulting gains are of solid 
advantage. The real value of the athletic system in stimulating 
loyalty and in fostering the growth of a college is not yet fully 
tested. It has been in effective operation less than a generation, 
and ex-members of teams have not had time to earn great 
wealth. Of the good will of the graduated athlete there is no 
possible doubt. He always holds his college in affectionate 
remembrance. He will work for it, and beg for it, but he would 
not claim to be alone in this. 
One aspect of athletics which stands apart from the merits 
of the games is the large sum of money necessary to run them. 
At one university, for instance, the expenditure on the teams
-P-A-G-E-283
  
ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 261 
was over fifty thousand dollars. This seems unduly large, but 
when we divide the total outlay for all teams by the number 
of boys who appeared upon the fields, the amount for each 
one does not appear so out of proportion. There were about 
two thousand men in rowing, baseball, football, track athletics, 
tennis, and many other minor sports, and the annual expense 
was about twenty-five dollars per student. Of course this does 
not represent the whole case, as most of the money was used to 
pay the expenses of the university football, baseball, track, 
and rowing teams on which only a small percentage of the 
students actually played. There are undoubtedly great waste- 
fulness and extravagance where undergraduates are entrusted 
with the management of the finances. They have not had the 
experience to safeguard them against loss. A graduate treasurer, 
or manager, is an absolutely necessary part of the administra- 
tion. Under the best of conditions, a large part of the income 
from the sale of tickets for the games goes into expenses that 
would have been thought wholly unnecessary twenty years ago. 
The training and equipment for a game are immeasurably 
more expensive than they were when a young man provided 
himself with a single garment to use in a boat race, and no 
trainer was thought of. Nowadays no player is expected to 
pay any part of the expense beyond what he would have to pay 
for his board under ordinary circumstances. Everything is 
provided by the management. This proceeds from two causes: 
first, the praiseworthy desire to give all students an equal chance 
for the teams, when otherwise the rich man would have the 
advantage of the poor one; second, the questionable desire to 
give every competitor recognition for his participation in ath- 
letics. The young man who makes a team usually looks upon 
himself as one deserving well of his university, just as a man 
who has fought for his country expects to hear of it. It is essen- 
tially the same spirit that creates a large pension appropriation. 
As a member of a second eleven once said, “I am working 
faithfully for the university, and I ought to have some recogni- 
tion.” He was arguing that he ought to be sent with the first 
eleven to a neighboring city, where he could enjoy a vacation 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
262 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
during term time. Not that any of the athletes are paid, but 
their relation to the management is precisely that of a citizen 
to the Treasury Department. The money seems to roll in 
freely, and the average boy does not realize the value of it. 
This is the real evil of gate money. No student should have 
his responsibility in money matters destroyed by the under- 
mining and agreeable process of spending unlimited means 
easily obtained. The correction is found in the graduate 
treasurer, and in a committee responsible for the collection of 
money and for the sale of tickets. By holding team captains 
and undergraduate managers to rules laid down by a committee, 
and relieving them of all money that comes in, reckless ex- 
penditure is at least checked. At the same time, income and 
expenditure should be reduced by common agreement among 
colleges. 
One of the largest items in the yearly budget is for training, 
which requires trainers, coachers, physicians, rubbers, and a 
special diet. The fundamental cause of the employment of 
doctors is that the men are undergoing preparation for extraor- 
dinary effort, and extraordinary risk. The heart has to be 
examined, and those who develop weakness rejected. Then, 
too, young men who are nearing the end of a season are said 
to be “on edge,”’ when the nervous system is on the verge of a 
breakdown. The services of physicians are most necessary in 
football. 
The trainer is usually a man who supervises the food and the 
general relation of the students to exercise, very much as a 
nurse looks after a patient, or as a mother tends a family of 
children. He is often, especially if good-tempered and straight, 
a very useful man. On the other hand, if suspicious and jealous 
of his reputation as a skillful manipulator of muscle, he is likely 
to set rival teams by the ears, and to exert his influence toward 
the worst kind of jockeying. He seldom possesses the ideals 
that should prevail in a college atmosphere. His introduction 
into sports springs probably from the difficulty of getting 
practical advice from the doctors. Their experience has usually 
been with sick men, and with the remedial methods necessary to
-P-A-G-E-285
ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 263 
cure the sick. When confronted with the problem of taking 
care of well men, they seem to fail. There is no telling what a 
man’s nerves will do under stress of emergency, and a good 
judgment of character is generally superior to a knowledge of 
anatomy. That there is much to be learned, however, is shown 
by the many disastrous failures of overtrained teams. The 
best training seems to be in a natural and regular life, with com- 
mon sense applied to the choice of food, and great temperance 
in the use of alcohol and tobacco. 
Another large item of expense is in traveling between colleges. 
A number of substitutes and advisers are often carried along, 
as, for instance, in a recent game requiring eleven men about 
sixty formed the squad whose traveling expenses were paid 
by the management. It is like moving a theater troupe. 
The engagements are made six months ahead, and sched- 
uled games have to be played on the hour, regardless of 
expense. : 
How far intercollegiate sports have demonstrated their 
permanent value as part-of a college education is still a matter 
of opinion. They must be judged in the end by their effect upon 
character. If they can be made to teach self-control and manli- 
ness to a large number of students without a sacrifice of the 
regular classroom work, they are worth keeping and assisting. 
The present evidence is, on the whole, favorable, although there 
is nothing to show that outdoor games wholly within the con- 
fines of each university would not accomplish as much. The 
intercollegiate feature is the main cause of the great publicity 
and of the numerous disputes. 
There is no doubt of the false perspective which on account 
of this publicity athletics assume in the eyes of every schoolboy. 
A boy preparing for college once explained the situation to me. 
“T must learn baseball and football. It doesn’t make any differ- 
ence how poorly I pass the examinations, so long as I get through. 
That has nothing to do with my career in college. If I can 
play football I amount to something immediately after I get in. 
What is the good of the other things, if I don’t amount to any- 
thing?” This theory of the case will not produce scholars or

     enlightened citizens, and it is upon this issue that the case must 
be worked out.

THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF MODERN ATHLETICS *° 
Arto BATES 
[Arlo Bates (1850——) is professor of English literature in the Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology. He is author of several novels and col- 
lections of poems, but he is perhaps better known, especially among students, 
from his writings on the stady of English composition, Talks 6n Writin,

ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 265 
     
                      
      
     Athletics in school and college have in recent years received so 
much attention that no one can deny the need of considering 
their influence in connection with modern education. The sub- 
ject has been largely discussed, sometimes with enthusiastic 
admiration, and sometimes with condemnation no less ardent. 
How much effect this talk has had it is not easy to say. Public 
opinion is seldom affected directly by argument; and until 
any popular fashion has run its course words seem to do little 
in modifying it. The partisan is apt to speak with too much 
force, the opposition with too great rancor; so that both more 
often provoke than convince. Argument in favor of the un- 
populer view is especially ungrateful, and is apt to seem com- 
pletely ineffectual. Yet the negative side should be presented. 
is geneyation prides itself upon being guided rather by reason 
than by impulse, and it cannot consistently refuse to consider 
even unpalatable objections. \ . 
At a time when the general voice so strongly indorses the 
present fashion of conducting athletics, I therefore venture to 
state some possible doubts in regard to the part which sport has 
come to take in the lives and training of young men. Although 
my views may not be agreed to, they may at least suggest some 
f sh thought upon a subject which should be examined with 
patient and dispassionate attention. 
_The physical isycontinually, and, of course, with cbvious 
truth» called the basis of mental growth. One of the doubts 
which'T venture to put forward is whether this fact has not been 
| made to bear more weight than it can fairly support. Few 
quotations have been more hopelesslysover-worked than “Mens 
sata in corpore sano.” The nourishment of the mind by the 
development of the body was one of the dreams of the idealists 
at Brook Farm; but Hawthorne drily comments that when the ° 
work of the day was finished, these cultivated men, instead of 
discussing philosophy and poetry, leaned idly on the stye and 
poked the pigs. That a diseased body will warp the mind is 
conspicuously shown by the violence of—dyspeptic.Carlyle, 
the pessimism of bed-ridden Heine, or the sentimentalism of 
consumptive Mrs. Browning; yet the intellectual results which 
\  
-P-A-G-E-288
    
266 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
these and others of their kind accomplished, the good that 
they did to society, will easily endure comparison with the work 
of most athletes. The line beyond which physical develop- 
ment cannot well go without injury to intellectual growth is 
probably to be drawn much nearer simple ordinary freedom 
from ill health than most theorists are willing to allow. [The 
effective intellectual workers of the world thus far certainly 
seem to have been of no more than ordinary physical endow- 
ments or training.) It is at least doubtful if bodjly culture can 
be made an end without stunting mental vigor;fand in these 
days we are face to face with the possibility, ‘ot with the cer- 
tainty, that the physical is being advanced at the risk of injury 
to intellectual well-being. 
The overworked phrase just quoted, “Mens sana in corpore 
sano,” seems in modern practice to have come to be translated, 
somewhat inexactly J" A sound body necessarily makes a sound 
mind.” )Life would be greatly simplified if the understanding 
could be brought to perfection by training the body; but the 
method suggests that of the mad professor who proposed to 
teach students all languages by setting them to build a second 
tower of Babel. The sane mind responds normally and joy- 
ously to bodily health; but such is human weakness that it is 
too prone to go no farther, to satiate itself in the delight of 
physical content, and to sink into mental inanition which is 
entirely satisfied to do without intellectual advancement. The 
enjoyment -of sport and of the excitement attending it has 
under present conditions not only to a large extent,taken the 
place of mental recreation and mental exertion, but it has also so 
warped the minds of many of the rising generation as to render 
intellectual pleasure entirely unattractive. The college man 
of to-day, 1 believe, has often been turned away from literature 
and the inner life by a too great zeal for athletics. What is 
worse, the absorbing fascination of sport has, in some cases at 
least, seriously crippled even the appreciation of the delight of 
mental growth. 
The constantly growing lack of the power of concentration 
and of intellectual manliness was the subject recently discussed   
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 267 
by a conference of leading teachers in Boston; and the Principal 
of the Cambridge High School did not hestitate, if the news- 
papers report him correctly, to attribute the difficulty in a large 
measure to athletics. The sentiment is one which I have heard 
privately expressed by a good many teachers. It is not often 
said publicly, probably for the reason given by the head of one 
of the best fitting-schools in New England. “To say anything 
against athletics in the present craze,” he declared, “does no 
good, and would simply diminish my influence with the boys 
and their parents; so I hold my tongue.” 
How general is the sentiment I do not know; but I do know 
that it is the general experience at the Institute of Technology, 
with which I have the honor to be connected, that a boy’s work 
suffers if he goes deeply into athletics. The practical, technical 
work of such an institution demands the first place in the 
interests of the student, and is not to be glossed over by cram- 
ming or forced effort. Such work is in a manner a fair, if a 
severe, test of the possibility of combining really serious mental 
discipline with any unusual degree of special physical training. 
Whatever may be true of an academic education—although I 
am not able to see why there should be any difference in the 
principle—a student in a technical school of high grade, in order 
to attain to success, must not only attend to his studies, but give 
to them the very first place in his interest. It is my belief, and 
my experience as far as this goes, that the work done by students 
_deep in athletics, while it may be conscientious, is seldom of the 
best or the most lasting quality. Exceptions there may be, 
and I am aware with what vehemence the statement would be 
denied by the partisans of modern athletics; yet, on the whole, 
Tam convinced that what I have advanced is substantially true. 
An incident which happened to me a few years ago will per- 
haps make more clear what I have in mind. It is one of a num- 
ber which might be given; but it chances to be particularly 
apposite. Coming from the West, I shared a section with a 
well-built, well-dressed young man, apparently between twenty- 
five and thirty. He had a wholesome, manly face, evident good 
breeding, and a personality at once attractive. In the middle 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  268 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
of the first forenoon, as we sat opposite, he said without preface: 
“T beg your pardon, but I should like to ask you a question.” 
“Well?” I responded. ‘‘How shall I learn to like to read?” he 
asked, with a seriousness evidently real. Then, in answer to 
my look, which probably showed my surprise at such a question 
from a complete stranger, he added: “I saw your name on your 
bag. I never read any of your books, but I’ve seen them on 
my father’s table, and I thought that you might help me.” 
He went on, in answer to my questions, to tell me his ex- 
perience. He had been brought up in a cultivated family, 
and by a father fond of books. In fitting-school and in college 
he had gone deeply into sports, playing first on the ’varsity 
baseball nine and later on the eleven. The intoxication of 
physical exertion and the strong delight in athletic competition 
—that personal struggle which calls out the most subtle refine- 
ments of human vanity—took upon him that hold which they 
inevitably take upon a normal and manly boy. He stood well 
in his classes; indeed, he said, in naive unconsciousness of the 
scale of relative values he was establishing, it would not have 
been fair to the team not to stand well in his classes. By little 
and little the old intellectual life to which he had been bred 
became cold and tame, and then slipped away from attention 
altogether. He said in substance: 
“Of course, I thought nothing of it at the time; but looking back I see now 
that we really had nothing in mind but athletics. We talked of the games 
beforehand, estimated chances, discussed the teams we were to meet—all 
that sort of thing was necessarily part of it, you know. Then after the 
games we went over them point by point, and talked of the different men and 
the newspaper reports. I can see now that I wasn’t really alive to anything 
but athletics all the time I was in college. I couldn’t to-day pass an exam- 
ination on any of the things I stood well in, but I could tell you the details 
of every game I played. After I graduated, I was sent to a country town 
to a factory my father owns, and there I’m learning the business. There’s 
no society, and I made up my mind to do a lot of reading. I knew I could 
never be the sort of man I want to be, the sort of gentleman my father is, 
without the help of books. I’ve been at it a couple of years, and I’ve waded 
through a lot of first-class things. They only bore me. I really care only 
for the newspapers, and in those I always read the sporting news first. Then 
I take a book, and go to sleep over it, and hate myself.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 269 
I do not pretend that I have reproduced his words literally; 
but I am not far from this, because the matter made so strong 
an impression on me. I have told the incident somewhat at 
length, because I felt then and I feel now that the case was one 
typical of a large class. It is typical, too, not only of the 
effect upon students who are actually on the teams, but to a 
great extent of the whole college fraternity as far as they are 
interested in athletics as at present conducted. It shows how 
it is at least possible for absorption in sport to swallow up 
higher interests. 
The notoriety attending any close connection with sports 
helps to foster this too great absorption in them, and it has an 
effect perhaps worse in tending to develop a vulgar appetite 
for cheap sensationalism. The newspaper gossip, the pictures, 
and the personal details about members of school and college 
teams, are about as unwholesome as anything which could come 
to lads in their student days, and the more so from the fact 
that these are entirely without relation to any intellectual 
merit or effect. ‘Notoriety,’ Kipling has said, “is a windy 
diet for a young colt”; and the image, if not overrefined, is 
shrewdly just. The boy who, as the phrase goes, has been 
“written up,” who has seen his picture shining through a haze 
of sham glory and smudgy printing in the Sunday newspapers, 
may by innate manliness and native modesty escape unbearable 
conceit; but he cannot avoid coming to look with tolerance on 
the offensive personalities of modern journalism, and he would 
be rather more than human if he escaped without some dis- 
tortion of standards. 
The English have certainly less excess in this matter than the 
Americans. An Oxford man said to me last summer: “But, 
you know, in American colleges the whole feeling about sport 
is what we consider a professional one”: and few would be in- 
clined to deny, I think, that there is more moderation and a 
better sporting spirit among English than among American 
undergraduates. Yet the London “Spectator” has declared 
that the army is going to ruin because its officers are at school 
spoiled by “the prevalence of what may be called the playing-
-P-A-G-E-292
    
270 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
fields fallacy,” and that nothing can be improved so long as the 
English parent “puts skill in games far above general intelli- 
gence and culture as a qualification for a commission.” The 
London “Times,” in a leading article, says that before the 
public schools can be held qualified to train men to be good 
officers it must be shown “that the reproach of training boys 
to care for nothing but sport, and fostering in them no habits 
of industry, is a malicious libel.” If there be any justice in 
such strictures on the other side of the water, what shall be said 
of our schools and colleges where athletics are carried so much 
farther? 
The feature which most markedly distinguishes modern 
athletics from those of the days of our fathers, however, is 
not the present elaboration, the extravagance with which every- 
thing is done, not even the publicity; it is the part which by 
incitement and by support is taken by adults.) (The encourage- 
ment given to sports by men long out of college, men of affairs 
and so of standing in the world, is the most peculiar and char- 
acteristic of the influences which affect undergraduate athletics. 
It is, perhaps, not too much to say that this attitude of men of 
consideration toward college and school sports is at present the 
influence most effective upon student life, and certainly it is 
the most important of all outside forces. This seems to me to 
be the chief cause of whatever in the present condition of things 
is undesirable. 
That the impulse and enthusiasm of youth should be restrained 
by the cooler judgment of age is perhaps an antiquated notion, 
but it is none the less a wise one. The inclinations which in 
boys are entirely natural and wholesome are often those which 
most need to be restrained and subdued, if a broad and sound 
development is to result. The natural tendency of the young 
toward physical enjoyment needs no spur. It should rather 
be tempered by the broader and deeper perception of those old 
enough to realize that, while sport must have a part in every well- 
balanced education it very easily slips into excess, and conse- 
quently into evil. 
The attention given to-day by adults to sports has thrown
-P-A-G-E-293
  ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 271 
things out of proportion.) Students are likely from natural 
impulse to give to sport a sufficient emphasis; and the result 
of present conditions is that young folk inevitably, even if only 
half-consciously, come to overestimate the value of physical 
training in education. Sport is the one thing in college life which 
at the present time awakens enthusiasm outside, and it is im- 
possible that this fact should be without effect. The thousands 
crowding to an intercollegiate game arouse every fiber in the 
young and- responsive collegian and set him a-tingle with ex- 
citement. Nothing connected with the intellectual side. of 
education is reinforced by outside interest in this way. The 
general public cares so little, for instance, for the intercollegiate 
debates as hardly to know which side wins. A debate is not an 
especially seductive form of recreation, but it is the one public 
event of rivalry between universities on intellectual grounds; 
and if any genuine interest in this side of college life existed in 
the people at large, some sign might be expected here. By 
actions, which are everywhere so much more effective than 
professions or protestations, the public, and the educated and 
cultivated portion of the public in particular, say to the under- 
graduate that athletics are of more consequence than anything 
else in a college career. It does not seem possible that under 
such a state of things the student’s sense of values can escape 
distortion. : 
This distortion of values is fostered, moreover, by the char- 
acter of modern sports. The claim that they develop pluck 
and produce a gain in self-control and responsiveness is undgubt- 
edly well founded. No one could for an instant deny the worth 
of these things: the question at issue is whether they are not 
perhaps in this instance purchased at too high a price. There 
are times in every noble life when the cool calculation of chances 
is the most contemptible cowardice; but the man who is a hero 
differs from the man who is merely rash or foolhardy largely in 
virtue of his power to distinguish the real worth of a cause. 
The man who encounters great peril for trifles has always and 
properly been held to have but an ill-balanced mind. 
In modern athletics the comparison between the gravity of
-P-A-G-E-294
  272, COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
the risk and the value of the result is such as to warp the judg- 
ment.’ I have no intention of bringing up the question of the 
brutality of football, or the horrors of the dressing-rooms at a 
modern athletic meet. These things are known sufficiently, 
and the advocate of athletics is forced to accept them as neces- 
sary evils, but evils not great enough to counterbalance the good 
which he believes to result on the whole. In face of fact, how- 
ever, no one can deny that the risks are possibly of the most 
grave. The New York papers last autumn published a list 
of some dozen fatal accidents on the inter-scholastic football 
field for the season; and whether this particular list be authentic 
or not, there have certainly been deaths enough from football 
accidents to give pause to those not either thoughtless or con- 
vinced that the end justifies the danger. For a youth to be 
trained to run this risk for mere sport is not likely to help him 
to a just perception of comparative worth; and so far as it 
influences his character, it would logically seem likely to make 
him rather rash than brave, rather foolhardy than heroic. He 
might be ready in the heroic moment; but the heroic moments 
are rare in ordinary life, and the opportunities for impetuosity 
and rash folly are numerous. This may seem somewhat ex- 
travagant, because the danger of fatal catastrophes on the 
athletic field is seldom realized; id it is generally held that 
the players do not believe in them or they would not play. 
Young and ardent lads will run any risk and enter upon any 
foolhardy enterprise, if they are sufficiently spurred on by the 
encouragement and applause of their elders; and, moreover, 
they do realize these things when outside of the actual ex- 
citement of play. The risks exist, and I have known more 
than one instance in which a man on a school or college team 
has felt himself to be by public opinion blackmailed into par- 
ticipation in a game which he regarded as dangerous to the last 
degree. Certainly, to be praised and lauded for running such 
risks as are admitted, when the stake is what it is, cannot help 
a youth to just appreciation of real and relative values. 
Undergraduates are jsenerally a pretty shrewd set. They are 
.at the least conventional period of life, and they are very little
-P-A-G-E-295
  ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 273 
likely to be deceived by conventional professions. . They may at 
first be imposed upon by the glib assurance that their elders en- 
courage athletic contests from pure interest in the well-being 
of youth and a noble and self-sacrificing desire to promote 
their higher education; but they are too shrewd not to perceive 
the spirit in which the sports are witnessed, and to appreciate 
the exact quality of that zest. The student understands the 
men who are genuine in their support, and who are actuated in 
their generous aid to athletics by a real faith in them: no less 
does he realize perfectly that the tens of thousands of spectators 
who rush to a football game come together in the same mood 
in which they would crowd to a bull-fight. He comprehends 
that the multitude is assembled by the love of amusement. 
The college serves as an agreeable background for personal 
preferences and exciting rivalries of talk or of bets. But the 
college on the field of sports touches nobody as an intellectual 
ideal: in that atmosphere it does not shine forth as an.alma mater 
of mental nourishment or of higher aspirations. Every college 
student realizes this with the unwinking clearness which is 
characteristic of these unreverential days. He sometimes says 
plainly that the crowd do not care for the risks of the player, 
if they can have their fun; although, as a rule, this side of the 
matter, if it comes to his f ought, seldom finds its way to his 
lips, lest he be suspected of flinching. He does not fail to be- 
lieve the men who with so evident sincerity and zeal declare 
their belief that athletics are of high value in education; he 
respects their genuineness and shares their views. Neither does 
he fail to comprehend, however, that if college athletics de- 
pended for support upon interest in education they would come 
quickly to a starveling end. The support of the public, despite 
whatever eloquent speeches are made to the contrary, the under- 
graduate knows to depend absolutely upon the extent to which 
the public is entertained. 
The leading educational institutions of the country are pre- 
cisely those places where this spirit of excitement and amuse- 
ment at any cost is most strongly felt. The indifference of 
people in general to intellectual concerns and their greed for 
 
-P-A-G-E-296

‘ 
  274 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
amusement are thus burned into boys at the most impressionable 
period of life, and that, too, under the sanction of the very 
universities of which the highest function should be that of 
nourishing the intellectual ideal. 
The intellectual standards of any civilized land are obviously 
e measure of its permanent ndvance, Tey are established, 
not by the many, but by the few; and’the few, the leaders of 
the higher thought, have a right to claim from a university its 
best support and codperation. The university which simply 
fits men for utilitarian ends is false to its best uses; and still 
more is it unworthy if it instill or foster material or degraded 
views of life. The university has a duty to the nation which 
is not- less than that which it owes to the individual student. 
Personally, I find it impossible not to feel that the prominence 
given at American universities and schools to athletics is a 
menace to their influence for good to the public or to students. 
‘Phe intellectual ideal may not havedeen abandoned or degraded; 
it most certainly has been obscured. 
The effect upon the universitiés which has been brought 
about by modern athletics is More grave, because more far- 
reaching, than any immediate effect upon individuals. The 
well-being of the student is a serious matter, but it is, after all, 
of less real consequence than any vital deterioration in the char- 
acter of institutions of learning. One cause cannot be entirely 
disentangled from another in considering the modifications 
which come about in complicated modern social conditions; but 
it is not impossible to distinguish at least the tendency of the 
present exaltation of sport. Social prominence in colleges to- 
day is so largely dependent upon physical prowess that what- 
ever power scholarship should have in this direction has been ] 
much discredited. The institutions which are nominally th@ 
conservators of the intellectual ideals of the nation introduce 
students into a society « intellectual distinctions. have    
sunk into a secondary place. (Instead of being four years in an 
atmosphere of learning and of mind, the youth is during his 
college course constantly impressed through his surroundings 
with the idea that success is to be won rather by the body than 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 275 
   
   
                                                            
   
   by the mind; that popularity is of more effect than culture; 
and that learning may be disregarded for more showy and 
ephemeral accomplishments. 
This unfortunate condition of things is more firmly estab- 
lished by the class of students attracted to college by the fame 
of athletic victories. The day that a university receives a single 
student who has been brought there by its record in the field 
it weakens its intellectual standing; and to-day it is difficult 
not to feel that not only have our leading universities taken 
in many such men, but that they have deliberately counted 
upon this means of increasing their numbers. In so far as a 
college is not responsible for such students, it suffers a mis- 
fortune in their coming; in so far as the college, directly or in- 
directly, is responsible, it has been false to the principles on 
which institutions of learning are founded; it has been guilty 
of sacrificing to present and fallacious appearances of prosperity 
its real and lasting efficiency. 
The grave matter of the moral effect of college athletics on 
individuals I touch upon with reluctance; and I have no hesi- 
tation in confessing that it is ‘@*point about which I neither feel 
clear nor qualified to speak conclusively. That, during.;train- 
ing, men are kept from dissipation is insisted upon constantly, 
somewhat as if it were fair to assume that they would neces- 
sarily be dissolute if left to themselves. Physically they are 
perhaps as often injured by overtraining as under other cir- 
cumstances they would be by vice; but it would be unfair 
not to recognize that the rectitude is good, no matter how it 
is promoted. To some extent, in individual cases, it is balanced 
by the excesses with which men “break training”; but, on the 
whole, the influence of self-restraint cannot but be beneficial. 
he fact that men in training are excused from drinking at 
clubs has introduced to some extent a decline in the old, silly 
and tyrannous habit of forcing by college opinion the acceptance 
of “treats,” and doubtless has diminished the habit of drink- 
ings What is of more importance, the prevalence of outdoor 
sport has done much to make the whole rising generation clean- 
m*’ Jed. :
-P-A-G-E-298
  276 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
These things are not to be passed over lightly; but they are, 
in the first place, advantages which need not be diminished if 
athletics were kept within proper bounds; and they are only 
remotely inspired by those ideas of moral responsibility which 
have in the past been universally regarded as the foundations 
of real ethical strength. The excesses in drinking, in gambling, 
and in general debauchery, which have accompanied initer- 
collegiate games, have created a good deal of scandal. They 
are said to be less flagrant than formerly, but it is not 
likely that they will disappear so long as the occasion 
remains. 
The influence upon character of becoming responsible to a 
trainer first, and to constituted authority only secondarily, 
certainly seems of doubtful merit; and of graver, because more 
insidious, effect is that of accepting support in athletic expenses 
to be repaid in public exhibitions. As a writer in “The College” 
puts it, when a man gets on a team “his classmates pay to make 
him so skillful that by and by they may pay to see him.” A 
student who would resent with fine indignation any pro- 
posal that an association of his fellows should.bear the cost of 
any intellectual training has apparently no scruples about 
allowing the same thing to be done when his bills are for physical 
development. The scandals which have arisen at the keeping 
of men in school or college simply to help on the teams are 
largely things of the past, since here, at least, public opinion 
has stimulated the somewhat sluggish college consciousness 
into a perception of advisability, if not of honor. The nearest 
that I have ever been able to come to a conclusion in this deli- 
cate question is that athletics properly conducted are advan- 
tageous to college morals, but that the present method of con- 
ducting them introduces evils which at best go far to counter- 
balance this good. gt ae 
In all that I have said I have been trying to deal with things 
as they are, and I have consequently avoided touching upon 
what might or should be. It is not my place here to dwell 
upon the brighter side, because this has already been so strongly 
insisted upon that an article such as this is meant merely to
-P-A-G-E-299
  ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 277 
arouse thought of possible drawbacks. No sane man can shut 
his eyes to the substantial advantages which belong to the de- 
velopment of the physical side of youth; and certainly I have 
no desire, as I believe that I have no inclination, to underrate 
them. The whole question, as I have suggested, is that of 
deciding whether the obvious benefits are worth what is now 
paid for them, and of seeing whether what is really good 
is not possible without what seem to be unequivocal evils. 
Life is a sharp huckster, and exacts the price to the last 
farthing. 
-<Too much attention has been paid to what is gained in ~ 
modern athletics, and not enough to what is lostX The true 
benefactor of the universities to-day, and through them to 
the community at large, must be he who would use his influence 
to arouse and to foster intellectual ideals, who would set him- 
self deliberately and effectively against the overvaluation of 
the physical, and do his part to recall the universities to their 
great office of correcting the materialistic tendencies of the age. 
Where is the country to look for the generating and nourishing 
of intellectual impulse if not to the educated classes? And 
how is this to come about if education means athletics first and 
mental good afterward? 
Whatever be true of cultivated men to-day, to the general 
-public the college has come to be so largely identified with sport 
as to represent ideals rather physical than scholarly. Even if 
unfounded, such an impression would be a misfortune from its 
influence in degrading popular standards. When public sym- 
pathy and interest have been brought to the point of appreciat- 
ing and enjoying the intellectual side of college life and effort, 
athletics may be magnified with comparatively little danger 
of evil conggguences. At present, enthusiasm for bodily training 
has so distorted and maimed the whole system of education 
that, at the obvious risk of offending and of seeming extravagant, 
I cannot refrain from closing with the deliberate expression 
‘of the conviction that athletics is in education to-day the 
most serious obstacle to the advancement of intellectual 
growth.

ATHLETICS AND THE COLLEGE! 
CHARLES ARTHUR STEWART 
(Charles Arthur Stewart (1885: ), lately professor of geology in the 
University of Idaho, graduated from Columbia University, where he. took 
an active part in athletics. Thereafter he taught two years at Columbia 
and several more at Cornell. He has always taken an active interest in 
American college life, and the generalizations made in this article rest, 
therefore, upon a wide experience and upon a mass of carefully sifted facts.]   
The abolition of all intercollegiate athletic contests involves 
the destruction of many phases of undergraduate life very 
dear to the college man. To mention the subject seriously is 
to brave the epithet “old fogey,” and to hear the scornful 
laugh of those who believe that nothing can successfully assail 
the position of intercollegiate athletics as one of the most 
valuable features of college life. It is a fact, however, that 
many thoughtful men, occupying positions of influence in 
college administration, are at present contemplating with alarm 
abuses which have crept into this phase of undergraduate 
activity,—abuses which to them seem so serious and so deeply 
rooted as to justify the abolition of the whole system of inter- 
collegiate contests.

  ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 70 
These abuses have nothing to do with the roughness of some 
of the games, or with the conflict between play and work; 
they have to do with the pernicious influence of athletics upon 
the moral life of the whole undergraduate body. Participation 
in college athletics may indeed teach control of temper, ab- 
stinence from dissipation, and willingness to subordinate one’s 
self to the efficient working of an organization; but it also teaches 
trickery and deceit. Training for a college team in these days 
furnishes a Fagin-like drill in complex dishonesty which far 
overbalances any benefits. At least that is the belief of many 
careful observers,—and it is a belief which experience as a 
student and a teacher in three universities, and an intimate 
acquaintanceship with athletics in a score of others have con- 
vinced me to be well-founded. 
In competition among gentlemen there is no place for the 
man who “stacks” the cards and signals his partner across 
the table; who deliberately miscalls the score at is; or who 
picks his ball out of a bad lie on the golf links. He is barred 
from reputable clubs, and is not welcomed in respectable 
society. Even the professional gambler respects fair play, 
and repudiates the “crooked game.” Yet college men, so 
often the soul of honor in all their other activities, see no wrong 
in deliberately and slyly violating in football, baseball, and 
kindred sports any rule which may diminish their chances of 
victory. A few illustrations will make this clearer. 
To weaken the opposing side by “putting out” its strongest 
players is a common practice in football. It may be done 
legitimately by concentrating the attack upon one man until 
exhaustion forces him to give way to a substitute; but in actual 
fact few strong players leave the game for this reason; they are 
more often temporarily disabled by a kick in the ribs, a knee 
thrust into the stomach, or a twist of the neck slyly given under 
cover of the play. Gleeful discussion of the success of such 
tactics can be heard among the players after many intercollegiate 
contests. The progress of every football game is interrupted 
by the referee’s penalizing first one side, then the other for 
“holding,”—an unfair use of the hands and arms. Every such 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
280 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
penalty means that some one has cheated, whether involun- 
tarily or with deliberation, yet the spectators make no com- 
ment, and in college circles the guilty players lose standing 
only in so far as the coach scolds them for being caught. 
Not many years ago I was watching the football practice at 
a well-known eastern university. The coach was a graduate 
of the university, and a mature business man of good repute, 
and I had heard members of the faculty express satisfaction 
that the students were going to be in the hands of so reliable 
aman. I saw this coach drilling the linemen in an illegal play, 
the essence of which was to swing the fist violently into the 
opponent’s face. After some minutes he vented his disgust 
with an awkward pupil in these words:— 
“Not that way, not that way, you dub! You have got to 
be nifty to get away with that play.” 
I see no objection to one man’s using his fist upon another, 
provided that it be part of the game. I see every objection 
to teaching a boy to “be nifty and get away with it.” 
In a basket-ball game it sometimes happens that a player 
gets the ball close to the basket. None of his opponents is 
between him and the goal, and there is no chance for anyone 
to get in front of him to block his throw in a legitimate way. 
The only defense is to rush at him from behind, and to shove 
him violently enough to spoil his aim. Such a play is a foul 
under the rules, but it is made time and again, because the 
well-trained player reasons thus: 
“Tf I do not shove this man, he will almost certainly shoot a 
goal. If Ido, he will not get the goal, and there is a chance that 
the referee will not see me; and even if I am caught, the penalty 
for the foul counts less for the other side than the goal which 
I am going to prevent.” 
No account is taken of the fact that the man has won this 
favorable position by skill and quickness, and is entitled by the 
tules to what he can make of it. The same tactics are followed 
. in regard to certain rules forbidding the blocking of opponents, 
for these rules are particularly hard to enforce. It is no un- 
common thing to hear players explaining after a game that they 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 281 
missed this or that play because they were blocked; and seldom 
is there any expression of resentment at the unfairness. It 
was forbidden by the rules, but the opponent “got away with it” 
and was entitled to the fruits. 
The same principle is at the bottom of “cutting the bases” in 
baseball. A man knows when he has failed to touch a base, 
yet time after time we see a runner cut wide of a base, and his 
opponents protest in vain, because the umpire has not seen the 
play. Meanwhile the man who by violation of a rule has 
shortened the distance he has had to run, grins complacently 
because he “got away with it,” and his college mates among 
the spectators applaud him as heartily as if he had scored by 
skill instead of trickery. In the few foregoing illustrations no 
reference is made to the faults committed-in the heat of the 
contest. A man may lose his temper and break his opponent’s 
nose, and still be honest; he may get over-anxious and start 
play before the signal, and yet not be a cheat; he cannot strength- 
en his playing by an assortment of intentional tricks that are 
expressly forbidden by the rules, and still be entitled to the 
respect of good sportsmen. 
The question of the eligibility of men to represent their 
colleges in intercollegiate contests calls forth tactics similar 
to those in vogue in the actual conduct of the games. There isa 
rule providing that no man who has competed in athletics for 
money shall play on a college team, and every candidate is 
required to give a signed statement that he has not violated 
this rule. In spite of this requirement there are constantly 
charges and countercharges of professionalism made by one 
college against another. It appears that the college athlete 
does not think highly of the word of honor of his fellows. Every 
charge of professionalism is an accusation of lying against the 
man involved. The fact that the implied falsehood is ignored, 
and that attention is given only to investigating the man’s 
amateur standing, shows clearly that prevarication in this 
matter is not considered a grievous fault. 
As a matter of fact, every man who has lived among college 
athletes knows that many of them have at some time received
-P-A-G-E-304
  282 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
money, directly or indirectly, for athletic competition. Actual 
proof of professionalism in any one case is as difficult as proof 
of bribe-taking among aldermen. Payments are not made by 
check, and are often disguised in more or less clever ways. I 
know of one athlete who received a goodly sum for acting as 
watchman of a building. His duty was to sleep in the building 
every night. In the daytime he played baseball with a pro- 
fessional team. I know of another who played a game with a 
professional team,—for which he was not paid. But after the 
game the manager went to his room and said: 
“Tl bet you twenty dollars that you can’t jump over that 
suit-case.” 
The bet was taken, and the jump was successfully made. 
Both of these men afterwards went to college and signed a 
statement that they had not “competed in athletics for money, . 
directly or indirectly.”” I believe that a large percentage of the 
men playing college baseball are guilty of dishonesty of this 
kind. The evil, of course, rests not in the playing for money, 
but in the cool denial of the fact. 
Another eligibility rule in effect in most colleges is that no 
man shall compete in college athletics more than four years, 
yet I have learned of many cases in which men, after represent- 
ing a small western college for a year or more, have entered a 
large eastern university and played under its colors for a full 
four years. To do this they had to deny their participation 
in athletics at the first school. 
If practices like the above involved only the guilty players, 
they could be attributed to the “black sheep” sure to be found 
in every group of men, and would not be ground for the arraign- 
ment of college athletics in general. They are, however, known 
to the other players, and in some degree to the whole body of 
undergraduates, which becomes so imbued with the spirit of 
“anything to win” that it supports them, and is therefore 
equally guilty. At every big intercollegiate contest you will 
hear among the spectators denunciation of the “dirty play” of 
the visiting team, when similar play by members of the home 
team has passed uncondemned, or mayhap has been praised 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 283 
in a gleeful, “Did you see Jack ‘get’ that fellow? He’s a slick 
one.” 
Except at a few institutions of notoriously low standards, 
college men are of very much the same type, and, on the aver- 
age, one college team is no better or no worse than another. 
Why then do undergraduates so seldom rise up and denounce 
the tactics of their own representatives, but so frequently de- 
mand the ruling-out of this or that player from a rival school? 
At my own college we learned, one autumn, that our baseball 
captain had played as a professional all summer. Our concern 
was not in regard to his successor, now that he had made himself 
ineligible, but about the chance of the discovery of the con- 
ditions by the faculty. It happened in this case that the 
faculty did learn the truth and debar the man from further 
competition; but if they had not, the entire undergraduate 
body would have cheered that man madly at the baseball games 
the following spring, and would have rejoiced boastfully over 
the victories made possible by his deceit. 
There is at large in the East at the present day a football 
coach who some years ago was involved in.a notorious scandal 
concerning the eligibility of several members of a team under 
his charge. Many years ago his mastery of the details of 
football crookedness earned him the familiar sobriquet of 
“Mucker,” but last year he acted as coach for one of the best- 
known colleges in the United States. His tactics are a by- 
word among men connected with athletic history, yet his 
retention is tolerated by alumni and undergraduates,—for he 
is a successful coach. 
These last two cases do not involve a few men, they speak 
for the attitude of the great majority of the alumni of two large 
universities. In fact the stories told in the foregoing pages are 
not taken from the athletic history of obscure colleges of uncer- 
tain standing. Yale, Columbia, and Cornell figure in them, 
and I could give others involving Harvard, Princeton, Pennsyl- 
vania, and universities of equal prominence and solidity. My 
quarrel, however, is not with any specific colleges, or with 
specific instances of unsportsmanlike conduct; it is with the lax  
-P-A-G-E-306
284 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
moral spirit which rules college athletics everywhere; and the 
stories are only illustrations in point. To prove that these 
illustrations are indeed typical of conditions in general is 
difficult, but if you are skeptical, let your mind run back over 
the intercollegiate contests you have witnessed, or watch keenly 
those which you see next spring and autumn; note the number 
of fouls called, and the penalties inflicted for offenses such as 
I have mentioned,—offenses not chargeable to loss of temper 
but to deliberate breaking of rules,—and see the matter-of- 
course way in which the cheating is passed over by both players 
and spectators; recall the instances in which athletes have been 
declared ineligible after having competed part of a season, 
and yet have remained in good standing among their college- 
mates in spite of the fact that they must have falsified to have 
competed at all, and you will see that the college man does 
expect these things, and that fair play in college athletics and 
fair play between gentlemen out of college are two different 
things. 
Count the number of officials required to supervise a football 
game, and read the special rules designed to let them watch 
the movements of every man; investigate the complex system 
which college athletic associations have instituted for deciding 
upon the eligibility of competitors who have already given 
their “word of honor” that their records are clear; read the 
stories of some of the disputes,—as full of affidavits and canceled 
checks as a New York State impeachment proceeding,—and 
then picture the analogue outside of college: two country 
clubs engaging in a team match at golf, each competitor re- 
quired to show a signed statement outlining all of his past 
athletic history, and reiterating in half a dozen places his good 
standing in his club, and nevertheless being followed all through 
the match by a carefully selected official who keeps a cat-like 
watch on his every move. The absurdity of it will emphasize 
the true meaning of the everyday occurrences in college athletics. 
In short, college men have in regard to their sports a standard 
of honor—if we may call it such—which permits practices not 
tolerated in any other walk of life. These men would not
-P-A-G-E-307
  
ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 285 
cheat in their private games; as a class they are honorable and 
courageously truthful in all the other relationships of life; but in 
athletics they tolerate trickery and deceit, and rejoice in the 
victories gained thereby. 
This is not merely a question of the conduct of college sports; 
it is a question concerning the moral training of future citizens. 
We are dealing on a small scale with that vicious philosophy of 
“get away with it,” that has been at the root of dishonest “big 
business.” Men, not content to make their fortunes in a lawful 
way, have contrived to circumvent interfering laws,—to violate 
them without paying the penalty, or so to violate that the 
penalty evoked will be small compared with the resulting gain. 
The heads of dishonest corporations and the participants in 
the profits of public graft are often men with a keen sense of 
honor in their personal relationships, strong supporters of 
philanthropies, and sincere worshipers in the churches, but 
they lack the complete moral sense necessary to enable them to 
apply one standard of right and wrong to all of their acts. In 
the same way college students are failing to carry their ideals 
upon the athletic field, and are allowing themselves to be 
governed in this one respect by a standard that is essentially 
immoral. 
When we reflect upon the prominence given athletics by under- 
graduates, and consider the hero-worship accorded the success- 
ful athlete both in college and by the general public, the deep 
import of the matter becomes evident. The undergraduate 
loves to say that every college community is in a sense a toy 
world wherein the struggle for fame and influential position is 
waged in miniature,—the scene of a sham battle fought under 
the same conditions and with the same weapons as in the world 
at large, and fought as a preparation for that real battle. If this 
mock world is to train good citizens it should be so governed 
that honor and truth are first in popular esteem, and trickery 
and deceit are outlawed. 
How to infuse into college athletics a spirit of fair play and 
truthfulness comparable to that ruling other undergraduate 
activities is a difficult problem, and some of the methods sug- 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  286 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
gested are based upon a superficial study of the conditions. 
The abolition of the professional coach, for instance, is not a 
solution of the question. We are told that when a man’s liveli- 
hood is dependent upon the success of his coaching he will 
stoop to any tactics to insure victorious teams, and that if 
athletic coaches were chosen from alumni, moved solely by 
love for their college and having no financial interests involved 
in victory, there would be less of the “win-at-any-cost” spirit 
inculcated. It must be remembered, however, that all graduates 
are the product of the evil system that we are discussing: We 
have seen that the college man does not regard the tactics we 
have mentioned as wrong, or that if he does, he tolerates, even 
supports them. His policy is not likely to change on gradua- 
tion. The desire to win is as keen among men who have gone 
through four years of intercollegiate athletics as is the desire 
to make a living. A careful comparison fails to show that 
colleges boasting of a “graduate coaching system” are at all 
superior in athletic ethics to those employing professionals. 
The practices prevailing in athletics at present may indeed have 
been first introduced by professional coaches; they flourish now, 
not because certain men teach them, but because undergraduates 
and faculties lack the logic to analyze them properly, or the 
courage to cope with them. 
A most certain cure for the evils mentioned, and one often sug- 
gested by those college administrators who give thought to this 
subject, is the total abolition of intercollegiate athletics. Such 
a policy is yielding to an evil rather than overcoming it. If it 
be true that a keen desire to win will drive the modern college 
student into unfairness and cheating, there is some weak spot 
in his moral fiber, and it would seem to be the business of the 
college, not to remove the temptation, but to make the man 
conquer it. Sooner or later every one must choose between 
losing fairly and winning unfairly. A boy who is made to face 
this problem in college, and made to solve it rightly, is better 
equipped to repeat the victory in the larger issues of life. Any 
one who has spent four years of his life working for the popu- 
larity and renown of a successful college athlete, and who has
-P-A-G-E-309
ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 287 
through it all resolutely refused to do anything but the fair and 
honest thing, is sure to come out of the experience very much a 
man. 
I believe such a solution is possible. The conditions existing 
in college athletics to-day are the result of gradual and insidious 
growth. The rottenness prevails largely because the men do not 
realize that it is rotten. The sanction of general custom is 
given to practices which, viewed as isolated acts, are mani- 
festly wrong, and the average college man accepts the condi- 
tions as he finds them simply because he has never stopped to 
analyze them. He lies about his eligibility and develops his 
dishonest tactics, not because he has deliberately chosen be- 
tween honesty and dishonesty, but because it is the thing ex- 
pected of him,—the thing that everybody does as a matter of 
course. 
Faculties should undertake a vigorous campaign of education, 
designed to show these matters in their true light. Most college 
men are essentially honest, and the chief need is to make them 
realize the true significance of what they are doing in athletics 
under the present system. Arouse the boys to the facts; make 
them see that cheating in football is the same as cheating at 
cards or as stealing money; foster a college sentiment that says 
fairness first and victory second; and attach the same obloquy 
to lying about eligibility that is attached to any lying. Do 
this, and you have gone to the root of the evil, and laid the 
foundation for lasting reform. This basic campaign for moral 
acumen should, however, be reinforced by two supplementary 
measures. First, make no rules, either of play or of eligibility, 
which are not strictly just, and which cannot be entirely en- 
forced; and secondly, subject all dishonesty to severe punish- 
ment. 
The first measure is in accord with the belief that legislation 
which the majority of the people does not consider just, or 
which cannot be enforced, makes for disrespect of the law in 
general. Many of the rules in regard to eligibility for college 
athletic teams are neither fair nor enforceable, and should 
therefore be eliminated if we are to have respect paid to those
-P-A-G-E-310
  288. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
which are based on justice. The only condition which we have 
a right to impose in limiting the personnel of a college team is 
that all members shall be bona fide students in good standing, 
and not brought to the institution by special inducements 
offered because of athletic prowess. Because some colleges do 
violate this essential, a number of rules have been made which 
aim indirectly to prevent this violation,—rules which in them- 
selves are unjust. The practice which obtains in larger col- 
leges of recruiting athletes from smaller schools is guarded 
against by the rule forbidding a man who has transferred from 
one institution to another to compete in athletics until after a 
year’s residence at the second school. This restriction works 
a real hardship by prohibiting from engaging in any sports men 
who are in actual fact members of the student body, but who 
have, for some good reason not connected with athletics, 
changed their choice of colleges; and the manifest injustice often 
makes evasion of the rule seem less reprehensible. 
Particularly vicious is the custom of denying the right to 
engage in college athletics to all men who have previously com- 
peted for money, and adherence to it is monumental hypocrisy. 
There is hardly a poor country boy with fleetness of foot or 
skill of arm who has not at some time in his life received a cash 
prize for winning a race at a village picnic, or who has not 
played on a country-town baseball team for a share of the gate- 
receipts. Such an indiscretion, committed long before he enters 
college, debars him forever from-athletic competition. More- 
over, men who attend college primarily for intellectual purposes 
often find that playing professional baseball during the summer 
offers the easiest and most healthful method of solving their 
financial problems; yet they must not depend upon this one 
resource if they wish to play with their fellow-students during 
the academic year. Here again the unfairness of the rule makes 
evasion of it seem, not a wrong, but the only way to obtain 
justice. : 
To my mind there is no place in college athletics for the dis- 
tinction between amateur and professional; that a man be a 
bona fide student of the institution he represents is all we have a
-P-A-G-E-311
  ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 289 
right to ask. Carried to its logical conclusion, the rule against 
professionalism is held in some countries to forbid any man 
who makes a living with his hands from calling himself an ama- 
teur athlete. A carpenter, for instance, cannot be an amateur 
oarsman. If thefe persists in colleges a vestige of this snob- 
bery,—if we are not yet ready to abolish all distinction between 
amateur and professional,—we must at least so revise the pres- 
ent rule that it will work less hardship. A few colleges have been 
courageous enough to do this, and now permit summer baseball, 
but most institutions still persist in a pretense of strict enforce- 
ment of the amateur rule, knowing full well that it makes many 
students either lie or submit to an injustice. Most of them lie, 
and feel that the means is condoned if not justified by the end. 
The second measure supplementary to education in right 
athletic ideals, is a firm stand by the faculties in all matters of 
athletic honor. All opinions to the contrary notwithstanding, 
undergraduates are influenced in their views of right and wrong 
by the general attitude of the faculty. Knowing that their 
teachers are interested in their moral welfare, they conclude, 
naturally enough, that anything these teachers do not oppose 
and punish is not so very wrong. This is well illustrated by a 
consideration of cheating in examinations. In those colleges 
in which the instructors are lax in the conduct of examinations, 
seeming to care little whether or not cheating is done, and 
punishing it when detected only by a reprimand and a mark of 
failure, there is always a feeling among the students that 
“cribbing” is a part of the game, and not a matter of honor. 
On the other hand, when every possible means is taken to 
prevent cheating, and when it is punished by expulsion, there is 
usually an undergraduate sentiment which puts the cribber 
in his proper place. I have seen in one college the whole student 
attitude upon cheating in examinations changed from indiffer- 
ence to stern disapproval by an improvement in the conduct 
of examinations on the part of the faculty. No change in the 
spirit of college athletics can be expected until faculties array 
themselves firmly on the right side, and refuse to tolerate dis- 
honest practices. A few men expelled for lying about eligi-
-P-A-G-E-312
  290 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
bility, and a few teams disbanded because of unfair play, would 
arouse undergraduates with a wholesome jolt. 
A forceful presentation of the facts of the situation with an 
appeal to the innate sense of honor of the undergraduates; 
such a revision of the rules as will retain only those based upon 
essential fairness; and a strict supervision by the faculty,— 
upon the success of these three measures rests the hope that 
college athletics may be purged of trickery and the spirit of 
“get away with it.” It will be a struggle of some duration, 
for it involves the remolding of the undergraduate point of 
view,—something akin to the making of public opinion, and not 
to be done ina day. I believe it can be done. 
In fact there is some basis for asserting that conditions in 
the larger Eastern institutions have greatly improved during 
the past few years,—a contention which finds support in the 
lack of scandal and recrimination connected with the big foot- 
ball games of last autumn as compared with the days of the 
Cutts and Hinkey disputes. This improvement is not, how- 
ever, fundamental. Disputes as to eligibility are prevented, 
not because the spirit of the undergraduates or of the coaches 
is above reproach, but because faculty committees maintain 
strict supervision over this matter, and allow no doubtful case 
to pass without investigation. More rigid enforcement of the 
tules has indeed made it harder to “get away with it,” but that 
there is still a desire to do so whenever possible, is shown by the 
continuous need for these very faculty committees, and by 
the ever-increasing mass of complex legislation designed to 
prevent or punish unfair play. 
If an honorable spirit of sportmanship ruled college athletics, 
why need there be severe penalties threatened for coaching 
from_the side-lines in football, and special precautions exercised 
by the officials to detect it? Should not merely forbidding it 
be sufficient? Why should it be necessary in basketball to 
provide that after four personal fouls a player must be removed 
from the game? I do not contend that every play, or even that 
the majority of plays, in intercollegiate games involves trickery, 
for I know that faculty supervision and vigilant umpiring have

  ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 291 
greatly reduced the more obvious forms of cheating in the games 
between the larger eastern institutions. I do contend, however, 
that even this veneer of fairness is lacking in most colleges; 
that college athletics are still ruled by the spirit of “get away 
with it”; and that merely preventing the actual success of 
fraud is but a superficial reform. Men interested in the ethical 
aspects of college life should not rest until college men meet 
in sports as do other gentlemen,—relying upon officials merely to 
aid in the administration of the games, and trusting to their 
own integrity to prevent intentional unfairness, and to their 
collective sense of honor to deal summarily with the occasional 
intruder who may refuse to accept their own high code. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. Does this arraignment impress you as being fair to college ath- 
letics as you know them? Give reasons for your opinion. 2. Discuss 
the effects of the win-at-any-cost spirit on the character of the student 
body of an institution. 3. What should be the true spirit of athletic 
contests? Consider how far the English ideal of play purely for the 
game’s sake is applicable to American conditions. Would our na- 
tional temperament permit such an idea to be widely accepted?

  292. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
ing bustle of our smoke-smothered towns, surrounded by their 
zone of poisoned trees, amid the whirling roar of machinery, 
the scorching blast of furnaces, and in the tallow-lighted black- 
ness of our mines—everywhere, over all the length and breadth 
of this teeming land, men, and women, and children, in no meta- 
phor, but in cruel truth, are struggling for life. Even our 
smiling landscapes support as the sons of their soil a new genera- 
ation, to whom the freedom of gladness is a tradition of the past, 
and on whose brows is stamped, not only the print of honest 
work, but a new and sadding mark—the brand of sickening care. 
Or if we look to our universities and schools, to our professional 
men and men of business, we see this same fierce battle rage— 
ruined health and shattered hopes, tearful lives and early deaths 
being everywhere the bitter lot of millions who toil, and strive, 
and love, and bleed their young hearts’ blood in sorrow. In such 
a world and at such a time, when more truly than ever it may be 
said that the whole creation groans in pain and travail, I do not 
know that for the purposes of health and happiness there is any 
subject which it is more desirable that persons of all classes 
should understand than the philosophical theory and the rational 
practice of recreation. For recreation is the great relief from the 
pressure of life—the breathing-space in the daily struggle for 
existence, without which no one of the combatants could long 
survive; and therefore it becomes of the first importance that 
the science and the philosophy of such relief should be gen- 
erally known. No doubt it is true that people will always be 
compelled to take recreation and to profit by its use, whether 
or not they are acquainted with its science and its philosophy; 
but there can be equally little doubt that here, as elsewhere, 
an intelligent understanding of abstract principles as well as 
of practical applications will insure more use and less abuse of 
the thing which is thus intelligently understood. 
With a view, then, of obtaining some such intelligent under- 
standing of recreation, let us begin by clearly understanding 
what recreation means. First of all, the mere word, like many 
of our other English words that signify abstractions, condenses; 
much philosophy within itself. For, as “creation” means a    
 
-P-A-G-E-315
ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 293 
forming, “re-creation” means a forming anew; and, as in ety- 
mological derivation, so in actual truth re-creation is nothing 
other than a re-novation of the vital energies; leisure time and 
appropriate employment serve to repair the organic machinery 
which has been impaired by the excess of work. The literal 
meaning of the word is therefore in itself instructive, as showing 
that what our forefathers saw in recreation was not so much 
play, pastime, or pleasantry, as the restoration of enfeebled 
powers of work. And I do not know that within the limits 
of one word they could have left us a legacy of thought more 
true in itself or more solemn in its admonition. Recreation is, 
or ought to be, not a pastime entered upon for the sake of the 
pleasure which it affords, but an act of duty undertaken for 
the sake of the subsequent power which it generates, and the 
subsequent profit which it insures. Therefore, expanding the 
philosophy which is thus condensed in our English word, we 
may define recreation as that which with the least expenditure 
of time renders the exhausted energies most fitted to resume 
their work. Such is my definition of recreation; yet I know that 
many things are called by this name which cannot possibly 
fall within this definition, and I doubt whether nine persons 
out of ten ever dreamed either of attaching such a meaning to 
the word, or of applying such a principle to the thing. Never- 
theless, I also know that in whatever degree so-called recreation 
fails to be covered by this definition, in that degree does it fail, 
properly speaking, to be recreation at all. It may be amuse- 
ment, fun, or even profitable employment; but it is not that 
particular thing which it is the object of this paper to consider. 
Therefore the definition which I have laid down may be taken 
as a practical test of recreation as genuine or spurious. If 
recreation is of a kind that renders a man less fitted for work 
than would some other kind of occupation, or if it consumes 
more time than would some other kind of occupation which 
would secure an equal amount of recuperation, then, in whatever 
degree this is so, in that degree must the quality of such recrea- 
tion be pronounced impure. 
So much, then, for the meaning of recreation. The next 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
204 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
point that I shall consider is the physiology of recreation. It 
may have struck some readers as a curious question, why some 
actions or pursuits should present what I may call a recreative 
character, and others not. For it is evident that this character 
is by no means determined by the relief from /abor which these 
actions or pursuits secure. A week on the moors involves more 
genuine hard work than does a week in the mines, and a game of 
. chess may require as much effort of thought as a problem in 
high mathematics. Moreover, the same action or pursuit may 
vary in its recreative quality with different individuals. Row- 
ing, which is the favorite recreation of the undergraduate, is 
serious work to the bargeman; and we never find a gardener 
to resemble his master in showing a partiality to digging for 
digging’s sake. If it is suggested that it is the need of bodily 
exercise which renders muscular activity beneficial to the one 
class and not to the other, I answer, no doubt it is so partly, 
but not wholly; for why is it that a man of science should find 
recreation in reading history, while an historian finds recreation 
in the pursuit of science? or why is it that a London tradesman 
should find a beneficial holiday in the country, while a country 
tradesman finds a no less beneficial holiday in London? The 
truth seems to me to be that the only principle which will 
serve to explain the recreative quality in all cases is what I may 
call the physiological necessity for frequent change of organic 
activity, and the consequent physiological value of variety 
in the kinds and seasons of such activity. In order to render 
this principle perfectly clear, it will be necessary for me very 
briefly to explain the physiology of nutrition. 
When food is taken into the body it undergoes a variety of 
processes which are collectively called digestion and assimila- 
tion. Into the details of these processes I need not enter, it 
being enough for my present purpose to say that the total 
result of these processes is to strain off the nutritious constituents 
of the food, and pour them into the current of the blood. The| 
blood circulates through nearly all the tissues of the body 
being contained in a closed system of tubes. This system o 
tubes springs from the heart in the form of large, hollow tr        
                                  
     
        
-P-A-G-E-317
   ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 205 
which ramify into smaller and smaller tube-branches. These 
are all called arteries. The smaller arteries again ramify into 
a countless meshwork of so-called capillaries. Capillaries are 
are also closed tubes, but differ from arteries in being immensely 
more numerous, more slender, and more tenuous in their walls. 
These capillaries pervade the body in such an intimate mesh- 
work that a needle’s point cannot be run into any part of the 
body where they occur without destroying the integrity of 
some of them, and so causing an outflow of blood. 
As these capillaries ramify from the arteries, so do they again 
coalesce into larger tubes, and these into larger, and so on, 
until all this system of return tubing ends again in the heart in 
the form of large, hollow trunks. The tubes composing this 
system of return tubing are called the veins. Thus the whole 
blood-vascular system may be likened to two trees which are 
throughout joined together by their leaves, and also by cavities 
at the bottoms of their trunks—the heart. The branches of 
both trees being everywhere hollow, the contained fluid runs 
up the stem, and through smaller and smaller branches of the 
arterial tree, into the delicate vessels of the leaves, which may 
be taken to represent the capillaries. Passing through these 
into the twigs of the venous tree, the blood returns through 
larger and larger branches of this tree till it arrives at the trunk, 
and completes its circuit by again entering the trunk of the 
arterial tree through the cavities of the heart. Now the blood, 
in perpetually making this complete circuit of the body, per- 
forms three important functions: it serves to carry oxygen from 
the lungs to all the other parts of the body; it serves to supply all 
parts of the body with the nutritive material with which it is 
charged; and it serves to drain off from all the tissues of the 
body the effete products which they excrete, and to present 
these effete products to the organs whose function it is again to 
abstract them from the blood and expel them from the body. 
The two latter functions of the blood—those of nourishing and 
draining—I must consider more in detail. They are both per- 
formed in the capillaries, so that the object of the arteries and 
veins may be considered as merely that of conveying the blood 
     
   
                        
       
-P-A-G-E-318
      
   COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
  2096 
to and from the capillaries. Moreover, both functions are per- 
formed by transfusion through the delicate walls of the capillaries 
—the nutritive material in the blood being thus transfused 
into the surrounding tissues, and the waste product of these 
tissues being transfused into the blood. Thus, in the various 
vascular tissues there is always a double process going on: first, 
that of receiving nourishment from the blood, whereby they are 
being constantly built up into an efficient state for the per- 
formance of their various functions; and, secondly, that of 
discharging into the blood the effete materials which the per- 
formance of these functions entails. Now, when any tissue or 
organ is in a state of activity in the performance of its function, 
the activity which it manifests entails a process of disintegration, 
which is the reverse of the process of nutrition; that is to say, 
when a tissue or organ is doing its work, it is expending energy 
which it has previously derived in virtue of the process of nu- 
trition. Work is therefore, so to speak, the using up of nutri- 
tion; so that if the income of energy due to nutrition is equal 
to the expenditure of energy due to work, the tissue or organ 
will remain stationary as regards its capacity for further work, 
while, if the work done is in excess of the nutrition supplied, the 
tissue or organ will soon be unable to continue its work; it will 
become, as we say, exhausted, cease to work, and remain passive 
until it is again slowly and gradually refreshed or built up by 
the process of nutrition. Therefore all the tissues and organs 
of the body require periods of rest to alternate with periods of 
activity; and what is true of each part of the body is likewise 
true of the body as a whole—sleep being nothing other than a 
time of general rest during which the process of nutrition is 
allowed to gain upon that of exhaustion. Thus we may have 
local exhaustion—as when the muscles of our arm are no longer 
able to hold out a heavy weight—or we may have general ex- 
haustion, as in sleep; and we may have local restorations due to 
nutrition—as when our exhausted arm, after some interval of 
rest, is again able to sustain the weight—or we may have a 
general restoration due to nutrition, as in the effects of sleep. 
I have now said enough about the physiology of nutrition
-P-A-G-E-319
  ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 207 
to render quite clear what I mean by recreation depending 
on the physiological necessity for a frequent change of organic 
activity. For although in the case of some organs—such as 
most of the secreting organs—activity is pretty constant, 
owing to the constant expenditure of energy being just about 
balanced by the constant income, in the case of nerves and mus-, 
cles this is not so; during the times when these organs are in 
activity their expenditure of energy is so vastly greater than 
their income during the same times, that they can only do their 
work by drawing upon the stores of energy which have been 
laid up by them during the comparatively long periods of their 
previous rest. Now, recreation applies only to nerve and mus- 
cle; and what it amounts to is simply this—a change of organic 
activity, having for its object the affording of time for the 
nutrition of exhausted portions of the body. A part of the 
body having become exhausted by work done, and yet the 
whole of the body not being exhausted so far as to require 
sleep, recreation is the affording of local sleep to the exhausted 
part by transferring the scene of activity from it to some other 
part. Be it observed that a certain amount of activity is 
necessary for the life and health of all the organs of the body; 
so it would not do for the community of organs as a whole that, 
hen any one set become exhausted by their own activity, all 
he others should share in their time of rest, as in general sleep. 
ut, by transferring the state of activity from organs already 
xhausted by work to organs which are ready nourished to 
erform work, recreation may be termed, as I have said, local 
leep. \ 
Thus we see that, in a physiological no less than in a psycho- 
gical sense, the term re-creation is a singularly happy one; 
lor we see that, as a matter of fact, the whole physiology of 
lecreation consists merely of a re-building up, re-forming, or 
-creation of tissues which have become partly broken down 
y the exhausting effects of work. So that in this physiological 
nse recreation is partial sleep, while sleep is universal recrea- 
ion. And now we see why it is that the one essential principle 
all recreation must be that of variety of organic activity;    
   
                            
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
-P-A-G-E-320
298 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
for variety of organic activity merely means the substitution of 
one set of organic activities for another, and consequently the 
‘successive affording of rest to bodily structures as they are 
successively exhausted. The undergraduate finds recreation 
in rowing because it gives his brain time to recover its exhausted 
energies, while the historian and the man of science find 
recreation in each other’s labors because these labors 
require somewhat different faculties of mind for their pur- 
suance. 
Before concluding these general remarks on the physiology 
of recreation, I must say a few words with more special reference 
to the physiology of exercise. We do not require science to 
teach us that the most lucrative form of recreation for those 
whose labor is not of a bodily kind is muscular exercise. Why 
this should be so is sufficiently obvious. The movement of 
blood in the veins is due to two causes. 
The act-of drawing breath into the lungs, by dilating the 
closed cavity of the chest, serves also to draw venous blood 
into the heart. This cause of the onward movement of blood 
in the veins is what is called aspiration, and it occurs also in 
some of the larger veins of the limbs, which are so situated with 
reference to their supplying branches that movement of the} 
limbs determines suction of the blood from the supplying 
branches to the veins. The second great cause of the venous} 
flow is as follows: The larger veins are nearly all provided wit! 
valves which open to allow the blood to pass on toward the heart 
but close against the blood if it endeavors to return back towar 
the capillaries. Now, the larger veins are imbedded in muscles 
so that the effect of muscular contractions is to compres: 
numberless veins now in one part and now in another par 
of their length; and, as each vein is thus compressed, its con 
tained fluid is, of course, driven forward from valve to valv 
Hence, as all the veins of the body end in the heart, the tot 
effect of general muscular activity is greatly to increase tht 
flow of venous blood into the heart. The heart is thus stim 
lated to greater activity in order to avoid being gorged with t 
unusual inflow of blood. So great is the increase of the heart    
   
   
                      
    
       
    
      
  
-P-A-G-E-321
ATHLETICS AND RECREATION 299 
activity that is required to meet this sudden demand on its 
powers of propulsion, that every one can feel iri his own person 
how greatly muscular exercise increases the number of the 
heart’s contractions. Now, the result of this increase of the 
heart’s activity is, of course, to pump a correspondingly greater 
amount of blood into the arteries, and so to quicken the circula- 
-tion all over the body. This, in turn, gives rise to a greater 
amount of tissue-change—oxygenation, nutrition, and drainage 
—which, together with the increased discharge of carbonic acid 
by the muscles during their time of increased activity, has the 
effect of unduly charging the blood with carbonic acid and 
other effete materials. This increased amount of carbonic acid 
in the blood stimulates the respiratory center in the spinal cord 
to increase the frequency of the respiratory movements, so that 
under the influence of violent and sustained exercise we become, 
as it is expressly said, “out of breath.” The distress to which 
this condition may give rise is, however, chiefly due to the heart 
being unable to deliver blood into the arteries as quickly as it 
receives blood from the veins; the result being a more or less 
undue pressure of venous blood upon a heart already struggling 
to its utmost to pump on all the blood it can. Training, which 
is chiefly systematic exercise, by promoting a healthy con- 
cordant action between the heart and arteries, diminishes the 
resistance which the latter offer to an unusual flow of. blood 
from the former, and therefore men in training, or men accus- 
tomed to bodily exercise, do not easily become distressed by 
sustained muscular exertion. 
Now it is evident, without comment, how immense must 
be the benefit of muscular exercise. Not only does it allow 
time for the brains to rest when exhausted by mental work, 
but, by increasing the circulation all over the body, it promotes 
the threefold function of oxygenation, nutrition, and drainage. 
It thus refreshes the whole organism in all its parts; it increases 
by use the strength and endurance of the muscles; it maintains 
the heart and the lungs—or rather the whole of the circulatory 
and respiratory mechanisms—at the highest point of their 
natural efficiency; and, in general, next only to air and food,
-P-A-G-E-322
300 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDIT'ONS AND PROBLEMS 
muscular exercise is of all ae most essential to the vitality 
of the organism. 
So much, then, for the ligelblogy of recreation; and, having 
said this much on the abstract principles of our subject, I shall 
devote the rest of my paper to a consideration of this subject 
in its more practical aspects. 
The fundamental principle of all recreation consisting, as 
I have said, in the rest from local exhaustion which is secured 
by a change of organic activity, it is clear that practical advice 
with regard to recreation must differ widely according to the 
class, and even the individual, to which it is given. Thus it 
would be clearly absurd to recommend a literary man, already 
jaded with mental work, to adopt as his means of recreation 
some sedentary form of amusement; while it would be no less 
absurd to recommend a workingman, already fatigued with 
bodily toil, to regale himself with athletics. And, in lower 
degrees, the kind and amount of recreation which it would 
be wise to recommend must differ with different individuals 
in the same class of society, according to their age, sex, tempera- 
ment, pursuits, and previous habits of life. But, although all 
matters of detail thus require to be adjusted to individual cases, 
there is one practical consideration which applies equally to all] 
cases, and which must never be lost sight of if recreation of an 
kind is to produce its fullest measure of result. This considera 
tion is the all-important part which is played in recreation b: 
the emotions. It is, I am sure, impossible to over-estimate th 
value of the emotions in this connection—a prolonged flow o: 
happy feelings doing more to brace up the system for wor! 
than any other influence operating for a similar length of time 
The physiological reasons why this should be so are not apparent 
for, although we know that the emotions have a very powerf 
influence in stimulating the nerves which act on the variou| 
secreting organs of the body, I do not think that this fact alon| 
is sufficient to explain the high value of pleasurable emotioi 
in refreshing the nervous system. There must be some furth 
reason—probably to be sought for within the limits of t! 
nervous system itseli—why.a flow of happy feelings serves

re-create the nervous energies. But, be the reasons what they 
may, we must never neglect to remember the fact that the 
influence of all others most detrimental to recreation is the 
absence of agreeable emotions or the presence of painful ones. 
There is, for instance, comparatively little use in taking so-called 
constitutional exercise at stated times, if the mind during these 
timés is emotionally colorless, or, still worse, aching with sorrow 
and care. If recreation is to be of good quality, it must before 
all things be of a kind to stimulate pleasurable feelings, and 
while it lasts it ought to engross the whole of our consciousness. 
Half-hearted action is quite as little remunerative here as else- 
where; and, if we desire to work well, no less in play than in 
work must we fulfill the saying, ‘What thy hand findeth to do, 
do it with thy might.” 
Health may be taken as implying capacity for work, as well 
as to a large, though to a less absolute degree, the capacity for 
happiness; and, as duty means our obligation to promote the gen- 
eral happiness, it follows that in no connection is the voice of duty 
more urgent than it is in thé advancement of all that is conducive 
to health. By maintaining our own health at the highest point 
of its natural efficiency, we are doing all that in us lies to secure 
for ourselves the prime condition for work—that is, the prime 
condition for benefiting the community to whatever extent our 
powers may be capable. And, similarly, by promoting the 
health of others, we are, in proportion to our success, securing 
to the community a certain amount of additional capacity for 
work on the part of its constituent members, as well as increasing 
the individual capacity for happiness on the part of all the 
members whom our efforts may reach. Therefore, I take it 
that if we regard this subject from an ethical point of view, it 
is clear that we have no duty to perform of a more grave and 
important kind than this—thoughtfully to study the conditions 
of health, earnestly to teach these conditions to others, and 
strenuously to make their observance a law to ourselves. Now, 
of these conditions one of the most important is suitable recrea- 
tion. For this is the condition which extends to all classes of 
the community, and the observance of which is, as we have 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
    302. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
seen, an imperative necessity to every individual who desires to 
possess a sound working mind in a sound working body. Hence 
I do not hesitate to say that one of our most weighty duties in 
life is to ascertain the kinds and degrees of recreation which are 
most suitable to ourselves or to others, and then with all our 
hearts to utilize the one, while with all our powers we encourage 
the other. Be it remembered that by recreation I mean only 
that which with the least expenditure of time renders the 
exhausted energies most fitted to resume their work; and be it 
also remembered that recreation is necessary not only for main- 
taining our powers of work so far as these are dependent on 
our vitality, but also for maintaining our happiness so far as 
this is dependent on our health. Remembering these things, 
I entertain no fear of contradiction when I conclude that, 
whether we look to the community as a whole, or restrict our 
view to our own individual selves, we have no duty to discharge 
of a more high and serious kind than this—rationally to under- 
stand and properly to apply the principles of all that in the full 
but only legitimate sense of the word we call recreation. Again, 
therefore, I say, if we know these things, happy are we if we do 
them. And if we desire to do them—if as rational and moral 
creatures we desire to obey the most solemn injunction that 
ever fell from human lips, “Work while it is day”—we must 
remember that the daylight of our life may be clouded by our 
folly or shortened by our sin; that the work which we may hope 
to do we shall be enabled to do only by hearkening to that 
Wisdom who holdeth in her right hand length of days, in her 
left hand riches and honor; and that at last, when all to us is 
dark with the darkness of an unknown night, such Wisdom 
will not have cried to us in vain, if she has taught us how to 
sow most plenteously a harvest of good things that our chil- 
dren’s children are to reap.

THE CHOICE OF BOOKS?! 
FREDERIC HARRISON | 
  
[Frederic Harrison (1831 ) is a noted English lawyer and literary critic. 
This selection was originally delivered in 1878 before the London Institution 
for the Diffusion of Knowledge. Subsequently, it appeared with some of the 
writer’s other discussions in the same field, in a volume entitled The Choice 
of Books.] 
It is the fashion for those who have any connection with letters 
to expatiate on the infinite blessings of literature, and the 
miraculous achievements of the press: to extol, as a gift above 
price, the taste for study and the love of reading. Far be 
it from me to gainsay the inestimable value of good books, or 
to discourage any man from reading the best; but I often think 
that we forget that other side to this glorious view of literature 
—the misuse of books, the debilitating waste of brains in aim- 
less, promiscuous, vapid reading, or even, it may be, in the 
poisonous inhalation of mere literary garbage and bad men’s 
worst thoughts. 
For what can a book be more than the man who wrote it? 
The brightest genius seldom puts the best of his own soul into 
his printed page; and some famous men have certainly put 
the worst of theirs. Yet are all men desirable companions, 
much less teachers, able to give us advice, even of those who 
get reputation and command a hearing? To put out of the 
question that writing which is positively bad, are we not, amidst 
the multiplicity of books and writers, in continual danger of

GENERAL READING 305 
being drawn off by what is stimulating rather than solid, by 
curiosity after something accidentally notorious, by what has 
no intelligible thing to recommend it, except that it is new? 
Now, to stuff our minds with what is simply trivial, simply 
curious, or that which at best has but a low nutritive power, 
this is to close our minds to what is solid and enlarging and 
spiritually sustaining. 
Whether our neglect of the great books comes from our not 
reading at all, or from an incorrigible habit of reading the 
little books, it ends in just the same thing. And that thing is 
ignorance of all the greater literature of the world. To neglect 
all the abiding parts of knowledge for the sake of the evanescent 
parts is really to know nothing worth knowing. It is in the 
end the same, whether we do not use our minds for serious study 
at all, or whether we exhaust them by an impotent voracity for 
desultory “information”—a thing as fruitful as whistling. Of 
the two evils I prefer the former. At least, in that case, the 
mind is healthy and open. It is not gorged and enfeebled by 
excess in that which cannot nourish, much less enlarge and 
beautify our nature. 
But there is much more than this. Even to those who reso- 
lutely avoid the idleness of reading what is trivial, a difficulty 
is presented—a difficulty every day increasing by virtue even 
of our abundance of books. What are the subjects, what are 
the class of books we are to read, in what order, with what 
connection, to what ultimate use or object? 
Even those who are resolved to read the better books are 
embarrassed by a field of choice practically boundless. The 
longest life, the greatest industry, joined to the most powerful 
memory, would not suffice to make us profit from a hundredth 
part of the world of books before us. If the great Newton 
said that he seemed to have been all his life gathering a few 
shells on the shore, while a boundless ocean of truth still lay 
beyond and unknown to him, how much more to each of us must 
the sea of literature be a pathless immensity beyond our powers 
of vision or of reach—an immensity in which industry itself 
is useless without judgment, method, discipline; where it is of  
-P-A-G-E-328
  
  306 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
infinite importance what we can learn and remember, and of 
utterly no importance what we may have once looked at or 
heard of. Alas! the most of our reading leaves as little mark 
even in our own education as the foam that gathers round the 
keel of a passing boat! 
For myself, I am inclined to think the most useful help to 
reading is to know what we should not read, what we can keep 
out from that small cleared spot in the overgrown jungle of 
“information,” the corner which we can call our ordered patch 
of fruit-bearing knowledge. The incessant accumulation of 
fresh books must hinder any real knowledge of the old; for the 
multiplicity of volumes becomes a bar upon our use of any. In 
literature especially does it hold—that we cannot see the wood 
for the trees. 
How shall we choose our books? Which are the best, the 
eternal, indispendable books? To all to whom reading is 
something more than a refined idleness these questions recur, 
bringing with them the sense of bewilderment; and a still, 
small voice within us is forever crying out for some guide across 
the Slough of Despond of an illimitable and ever-swelling 
literature. How many a man stands beside it, as uncertain 
of his pathway as the Pilgrim, when he who dreamed the im- 
mortal dream heard him “break out with a lamentable cry: 
saying, what shall I do?” And this, which comes home to all 
of us at times, presses hardest upon those who have lost the 
opportunity of systematic education, who have to educate 
themselves, or who seek to guide the education of their young 
people. 
Systematic reading is but little in favor even among studi- 
ous men; in a true sense it is hardly possible for women. A 
comprehensive course of home study, and a guide to books 
fit for the highest education of women, is yet a blank page 
remaining to be filled. Generations of men of culture have 
labored to organize a system of reading and materials appro- 
priate for the methodical education of men in academic lines. 
Teaching equal in mental caliber to any that is open to men in 
universities, yet modified for the needs of those who must

study at home, remains in the dim pages of that melancholy 
volume entitled “ Libri valde desiderati.” * 
I do not aspire to fill one of those blank pages; but I long to 
speak a word or two, as the Pilgrim did to Neighbor Pliable, 
upon the glories that await those who will pass through the 
narrow wicket-gate. On this, if one can find anything useful 
to say, it may be chiefly from the memory of the waste labor 
and pitiful stumbling in the dark which fill up so much of the 
travail that one is fain to call one’s own education. We who 
have wandered in the wastes so long, and lost so much of our 
lives in our wandering, may at least offer warnings to younger 
wayfarers, as men who in thorny paths have borne the heat 
and burden of the day might give a clue to their journey to 
those who have yet a morning anda noon. As I look back and 
think of those cataracts of printed stuff which honest composi- 
tors set up, meaning, let us trust, no harm, and which at least 
found them in daily bread,—printed stuff which I and the rest 
of us, to our infinitely small profit, have consumed with our 
eyes, not even making an honest living of it, but much impairing 
our substance,—I could almost reckon the printing press as 
among the scourges of mankind. I am grown a wiser and a 
sadder man, importunate, like that Ancient Mariner, to tell 
each blithe wedding guest the tale of his shipwreck on the 
infinite sea of printers’ ink, as one escaped by mercy and grace 
from the region where there is water, water, everywhere, and 
not a drop to drink. 
A man of power, who has got more from books than most of 
his contemporaries, once said: “Form a habit of reading, do 
not mind what you read; the reading of better books will come 
when you have a habit of reading the inferior.” We need not 
accept this obiter dictum* of Lord Sherbrooke. A habit of 
reading idly debilitates and corrupts the mind for all whole- 
some reading; the habit of reading wisely is one of the 
most difficult habits to acquire, needing strong resolution 
and infinite pains; and reading for mere reading’s sake, in- 
   1 Books greatly desired. 2 Thing said in passing.

          308 
stead of for the sake of the good we gain from reading, is one 
of the worst and commonest and most unwholesome habits 
we have. 
And so our inimitable humorist has made delightful fun of 
the solid books,—which no gentleman’s library should be with- 
out,—the Humes, Gibbons, Adam Smiths, which, he says, are 
not books at all, and prefers some “kind-hearted play-book,” 
or at times the ‘Town and County Magazine.” 
Poor Lamb has not a little to answer for, in the revived relish 
for garbage unearthed from old theatrical dung-heaps. Be it 
jest or earnest, I have little patience with the Eleatic philosophy 
of the frivolous. Why do we still suffer the traditional hy- 
pocrisy about the dignity of literature—literature, I mean, in 
the gross, which includes about equal parts of what is useful 
and what is useless? Why are books as books, writers as writers, 
readers as readers, meritorious, apart from any good in them, 
or anything that we can get from them? Why do we pride 
ourselves on our powers of absorbing print, as our grand- 
fathers did on their gifts in imbibing port, when we know that 
there is a mode of absorbing print, which makes it impossible 
that we can ever learn anything good out of books? 
Our stately Milton said in a passage which is one of the watch- 
words of the English race, “as good almost kill a Man as kill 
a good Book.’”’ But has he not also said that he would “have 
a vigilant eye how Bookes demeane themselves, as well as 
men; and do sharpest justice on them as malefactors”? ... 
Yes! they do kill the good book who deliver up their few and 
precious hours of reading to the trivial book; they make it 
dead for them; they do what lies in them to destroy ‘‘the precious 
life-blood of a master-spirit, imbalm’d and treasured up on 
purpose to a life beyond life”; they “spill that season’d life 
of man preserv’d and stor’d up in Bookes.” For in the wilder- 
ness of books most men, certainly all busy men, must strictly 
choose. If they saturate their minds with the idler books, the 
“good book,” which Milton calls “an immortality rather than 
a lie,” is dead to them: it is a book sealed up and buried. 
It is most right that in the great republic of letters there should 
            
                                             
         
-P-A-G-E-331
GENERAL READING 309 
be freedom of intercourse and a spirit of equality. Every 
reader who holds a book in his hand is free of the inmost minds 
of men past and present; their lives both within and without 
the pale of their uttered thoughts are unveiled to him; he 
needs no introduction to the greatest; he stands on no cere- 
mony with them; he may, if he be so minded, scribble “doggerel”’ 
on his Shelley, or he may kick Lord Byron, if he please, into a 
corner. He hears Burke perorate, and Johnson dogmatize, 
and Scott tell his border tales, and Wordsworth muse on the 
hillside, without the leave of any man, or the payment of any 
toll. In the republic of letters there are no privileged orders 
or places reserved. Every man who has written a book, even 
the diligent Mr. Whitaker, is in one sense an author; “a book’s 
a book although there’s nothing in’t”’; and every man who can 
decipher a penny journal is in one sense a reader. And your 
“general reader,” like the grave-digger in “Hamlet,” is hail- 
fellow with all the mighty dead; he pats the skull of the jester; 
batters the cheek of lord, lady, or courtier; and uses “imperious 
Cesar” to teach boys the Latin declensions. 
But this notable equality of all writers—of all writers and 
of all readers—has a perilous side to it. It is apt to make us 
discriminate in the books we read, and somewhat contemptuous 
of the mighty men of the past. Men who are most observant 
as to the friends they make, or the conversation they share, are 
carelessness itself as to the books to whom they intrust them- 
selves, and the printed language with which they saturate 
their minds. Yet can any friendship or society be more im- 
portant to us than that of the books which form so large a 
part of our minds and even of our characters? Do we in real life 
take any pleasant fellow to our homes and chat with some 
agreeable rascal by our firesides, we who will take up any pleas- 
ant fellow’s printed memoirs, we who delight in the agreeable 
rascal when he is cut up into pages and bound in calf? If any 
person giving to reading were honestly to keep a register of all 
the printed stuff that he or she consumes in a year—all the idle 
tales of which the very names and the story are forgotten in a 
week, the bookmaker’s prattle about nothing at so much a
-P-A-G-E-332
  310 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
sheet, the fugitive trifling about silly things and empty people, 
the memoirs of the unmemorable, and lives of those who 
never really lived at all—of what a mountain of rubbish would 
be the catalogue! Exercise for the eye and the memory, as 
mechanical as if we set ourselves to learn the names, ages, and 
family histories of every one who lives in our own street, the 
flirtations of their maiden aunts, and the circumstances sur- 
rounding the birth of their grandmothers’ first baby. 
It is impossible to give any method to our reading till we get 
nerve enough to reject. The most exclusive and careful 
among us will (in literature) take boon companions out of the 
street, as easily as an idler in a tavern. “I came across such 
and such a book that I never heard mentioned,” says one, “and 
found it curious, though entirely worthless.” - “I strayed on a 
volume by I know not whom, on a subject for which I never 
cared.” Andsoon. There are curious and worthless creatures 
enough in any pot-house all day long; and there is incessant talk 
in omnibus, train, or street by we know not whom, about we care 
not what. Yet if a printer and a bookseller can be induced to 
make this gabble as immortal as print and publication can make 
it, then it straightway is literature, and in due time it becomes 
“curious.” 
I have no intention to moralize or to indulge in a homily 
against the reading of what is deliberately evil. There is not 
so much need for this now, and I am not discoursing on the 
whole duty of man. I take that part of our reading which by 
itself is no doubt harmless, entertaining, and even gently 
instructive. But of this enormous mass of literature how much 
deserves to be chosen out, to be preferred to all the great books 
of the world, to be set apart for those precious hours which are 
all that the most of us can give to solid reading?. The vast pro- 
portion of books are books that we shall never be able to read. 
A serious percentage of books are not worth reading at all. 
The really vital books for us we also know to be a very trifling 
portion of the whole. And yet we act as if every book were as 
good as any other, as if it were merely a question of order which 
we take up first, as if any book were good enough for us, and as
-P-A-G-E-333
GENERAL READING 3it 
if all were alike honorable, precious, and satisfying. Alas! books 
cannot be more than the men who write them; and as a fair 
proportion of the human race now write books, with motives 
and objects as various as human activity, books as books, are 
entitled @ priori, until their value is proved, to the same atten- 
tion and respect as houses, steam-engines, pictures, fiddles, 
bonnets, and other products of human industry. 
In the shelves of those libraries which are our pride, libraries 
public or private, circulating or very stationary, are to be 
found those great books of the world rari nantes in gurgite vasto,! 
those books which are truly “the precious life-blood of a master- 
spirit.” But the very familiarity which their mighty fame 
has bred in us makes us indifferent; we. grow weary of what 
every one is supposed to have read; and we take down something 
which looks a little eccentric, some worthless book, on the mere 
ground that we never heard of it before. Thus the difficulties 
of literature are in their way as great as those of the world, the 
obstacles to finding the right friends are as great, the peril is as 
great of being lost in a Babel of voices and an ever-changing 
mass of beings. 
Books are not wiser than men, the true books are not easier 
to find than the true men, the bad books or the vulgar books 
are not less obtrusive and not less ubiquitous than the bad or 
vulgar men are everywhere; the art of right reading is as long 
and difficult to learn as the art of right living. Those who are 
on good terms with the first author they meet, run as much risk 
as men who surrender their time to the first passer in the street; 
for to be open to every book is for the most part to gain as little 
as possible from any. A man aimlessly wandering about in a 
crowded city is of all men the most lonely; so he who takes up 
only the books that he “comes across” is pretty certain to 
meet but few that are worth knowing. 
Now this danger is one to which we are specially exposed in 
this age. Our high-pressure life of emergencies, our whirling 
industrial organization or disorganization have brought us in 
this (as in most things) their peculiar difficulties and drawbacks, 
1 Floating here and there in the surging sea.  
-P-A-G-E-334
  
312. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
In almost everything vast opportunities and gigantic means of 
multiplying our products bring with them new perils and 
troubles which are often at first neglected. Our huge cities, 
where wealth is piled up and the requirements and appliances of 
life extended beyond the dreams of our forefathers, seem to 
breed in themselves new forms of squalor, disease, blights, or 
risks to life such as we are yet unable to master. So the enor- 
mous multiplicity of modern books is not altogether favorable 
to the knowing of the best. I listen with mixed satisfaction 
to the peans that they chant over the works which issue from 
the press each day; how the books poured forth from Pater- 
noster Row might in a few years be built into a pyramid that 
would fill the dome of St. Paul’s. How in this mountain of litera- 
ture am I to find the really useful book? How, when I have 
found it, and found its value, am I to get others to read it? 
How am I to keep my head clear in the torrent and din of works, 
all of which distract my attention, most of which promise me 
something, while so few fulfill that promise? The Nile is the 
source of the Egyptian’s bread, and without it he perishes of 
hunger. But the Nile may be rather too liberal in his flood, 
and then the Egyptian runs imminent risk of drowning. 
And thus there never was a time, at least during the last two 
hundred years, when the difficulties in the way of making an 
efficient use of books were greater than they are to-day, when 
the obstacles were more real between readers and the right 
books to read, when it was practically so troublesome to find out 
that which it is of vital importance to know; and that not by the 
dearth, but by the plethora of printed matter. For it comes to 
nearly the same thing whether we are actually debarred by 
physical impossibility from getting the right book into our hand, 
or whether we are choked off from the right book by the ob- 
trusive crowd of the wrong books; so that it needs a strong 
character and a resolute system of reading to keep the head cool 
in the storm of literature around us. We read nowadays in the 
market-place—I would rather say in some large steam factory 
of letter-press, where damp sheets of new print whirl round us 
perpetually—if it be not rather some noisy book-fair where 
 
-P-A-G-E-335

literary showmen tempt us with performing dolls, and the 
gongs of rival booths are stunning our ears from morn till 
night. 
Contrast with this pandemonium of Leipsic and Paternoster 
Row the sublime picture of our Milton in his early retirement 
at Horton, when, musing over his coming flight to the epic 
heaven, practising his pinions, as he tells Diodati, he consumed 
five years of solitude in reading the ancient writers— 
“Et totum rapiunt me, mea vita, libri.” 1 
Who now reads the ancient writers? Who systematically 
reads the great writers, be they ancient or modern, whom the 
consent of ages has marked out as classics: typical, immortal, 
peculiar teachers of our race? Alas! the “Paradise Lost” is 
lost again to us beneath an inundation of graceful academic 
verse, sugary stanzas of ladylike prettiness, and ceaseless ex- 
planations in more or less readable prose of what John Milton 
meant or did not mean, or what he saw or did not see, who 
married his great-aunt, and why Adam or Satan is like that, or 
unlike the other. We read a perfect library about the “Paradise 
Lost,” but the “Paradise Lost”’ itself we do not read. 
I am not presumptuous enough to assert that the larger part 
of modern literature is not worth reading in itself, that the prose 
is not readable, entertaining, one may say highly instructive. 
Nor do I pretend that the verses which we read so zealously in 
place of Milton’s are not good verses. On the contrary, I think 
them sweetly conceived, as musical and as graceful as the verse 
of any age in our history. A great deal of our modern literature 
is such that it is exceedingly difficult to resist it, and it is un- 
deniable that it gives us real information. It seems perhaps 
unreasonable to many to assert that a decent readable book 
which gives us actual instruction can be otherwise than a useful 
companion and a solid gain. Possibly many people are ready 
to cry out upon me as an obscurantist for venturing to doubt 
a genial confidence in all literature simply as such. But the 
question which weighs upon me with such really crushing 
1 And my book, my life, possess me utterly.

  314. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
urgency is this: What are the books that in our little remnant 
of reading time it is most vital for us to know? For the 
true use of books is of such sacred value to us that to be simply 
entertained is to cease to be taught, elevated, inspired by 
books; merely to gather information of a chance kind is to 
~ close the mind to knowledge of the urgent kind. 
Every book that we take up without a purpose is an oppor- 
tunity lost of taking up a book with a purpose—every bit of 
stray information which we cram into our heads without any 
sense of its importance, is for the most part a bit of the most 
useful information driven out of our heads and choked off from 
our minds. 
It is so certain that information, 7. e., the knowledge the 
stored thoughts and observations of mankind, is now grown to 
proportions so utterly incalculable and prodigious, that even the 
learned whose lives are given to study can but. pick up some 
crumbs that fall from the table of truth. They delve and tend 
but a plot in that vast and teeming kingdom, while those 
whom active life leaves with but a few cramped hours of study 
can hardly come to know the very vastness of the field before 
them, or how infinitesimally small is the corner they can traverse 
at the best. We know all is not of equal value. We know that 
books differ in value as much as diamonds differ from the sand 
on the seashore, as much as our living friend differs from a 
dead rat. We know that much in the myriad-peopled world 
of books—very much in all kinds—is trivial, enervating, inane, 
even obnoxious. And thus, where we have infinite opportuni- 
ties of wasting our efforts to no end, of fatiguing our minds 
without enriching them, of clogging the spirit without satis- 
fying it, there, I cannot but think, the very infinity of oppor- 
tunities is robbing us of the actual power of using them. And 
thus I come often, in my less hopeful moods, to watch the re- 
morseless cataract of daily literature which thunders over the 
remnants of the past, as if it were a fresh impediment to the 
men of our day in the way of systematic knowledge and con- 
sistent powers of thought, as if it were destined one day to 
overwhelm the great inheritance of mankind in prose and verse.
-P-A-G-E-337
GENERAL READING 315 
I remember, when I was a very young man at college, that a 
youth, in no spirit of paradox, but out of plenary conviction, 
undertook to maintain before a body of serious students, the 
astounding proposition that the invention of printing had been 
one of the greatest misfortunes that had ever befallen mankind. 
He argued that exclusive reliance on printed matter had de- 
stroyed the higher method of oral teaching, the dissemination 
of thought by the spoken word to the attentive ear. He in- 
sisted that the information of a vast literary class looking to the 
making of books as a means of making money rather than as a 
social duty, had multiplied books for the sake of the writers 
rather than for the sake of the readers; that the reliance on 
books as a cheap and common resource had done much to weaken 
the powers of memory; that it destroyed the craving for a 
general culture of taste, and the need of artistic expression in 
all the surroundings of life. And he argued lastly that the 
sudden multiplication of all kinds of printed matter had been 
fatal to the orderly arrangement of thought, and had hindered 
a system of knowledge and a scheme of education. 
I am far from sharing this immature view. Of course I hold 
the invention of printing to have been one of the most momen- 
tous facts in the whole history of man. Without it universal 
social progress, true democratic enlightenment, and the educa- 
tion of the people would have been impossible, or very slow, 
even if the cultured few, as is likely, could have advanced the 
knowledge of mankind without it. We place Gutemberg 
among the small list of the unique and special benefactors of 
mankind, in the sacred choir of those whose work transformed 
the conditions of life, whose work, once done, could never be 
repeated. And no doubt the things which our ardent friend 
regarded as so fatal a disturbance of society were all inevitable 
and necessary, part of the great revolution of mind through 
which men grew out of the mediaeval incompleteness to a richer 
conception of life and of the world. 
Yet there is a sense in which this boyish anathema against 
printing may become true to us by our own fault. We may 
create for ourselves these very evils. For the art of printing 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  316 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
has not been a gift wholly unmixed with evils; it must be used 
wisely if it is to be a boon to man at all; it entails on us heavy 
responsibilities, resolution to use it with judgment and self- 
control, and the will to resist its temptations and its perils. 
Indeed, we may easily so act that we may make it a clog on the 
progress of the human mind, a real curse and not a boon. 
The power of flying at will through space would probably ex- 
tinguish civilization and society, for it would release us from the 
wholesome bondage of place and rest. The power of hearing 
every word that had ever been uttered on this planet would 
annihilate thought, as the power of knowing all recorded facts 
by the process of turning a handle would annihilate true science. 
Our human faculties and our mental forces are not enlarged 
simply by multiplying our materials of knowledge and our 
facilities for communication. Telephones, microphones, panto- 
scopes, steam-presses, and ubiquity-engines in general may, 
after all, leave the poor human brain panting and throbbing 
under the strain of its appliances, no bigger and no stronger 
than the brains of the men who heard Moses speak, and saw 
Aristotle and Archimedes pondering over a few worn rolls of 
crabbed manuscript. Until some new Gutemberg or Watt 
can invent a machine for magnifying the human mind, every 
fresh apparatus for multiplying its work is a fresh strain on the 
mind, a new realm for it to order and to rule. 
And so, I say it most confidently, the first intellectual task 
of our age is rightly to order and make serviceable the vast 
realm of printed material which four centuries have swept 
across our path. To organize our knowledge, to systematize 
our reading, to save, out of the relentless cataract of ink, the 
immortal thoughts of the greatest—this is a necessity, unless 
the productive ingenuity of man is to lead us at last to a measure- 
less and pathless chaos. To know anything that turns up is, in 
the infinity of knowledge, to know nothing. To read the first 
book we come across, in the wilderness of books, is to learn 
nothing. To turn over the pages of ten thousand volumes is 
to be practically indifferent to all that is good. 
But this warns me that I am entering on a subject which

   is far too big and solemn. It is plain that to organize our 
knowledge, even to systematize our reading, to make a working 
selection of books for general study, really implies a complete 
scheme of education. A scheme of education ultimately im- 
plies a system of philosophy, a view of man’s duty and powers as 
a moral and social being—a religion. Before a problem so 
great as this, on which readers have such different ideas and 
wants, and differ so profoundly on the very premises from which 
we start, before such a problem as a general theory of education, 
I prefer to pause. I will keep silence even from good words. I 
have chosen my own part, and adopted my own teacher. But 
to ask men to adopt the education of Auguste Comte, is almost 
to ask them to adopt Positivism itself. Nor will I enlarge on 
the matter for thought, for foreboding, almost for despair, that is 
presented to us by the fact of our familiar literary ways and our 
recognized literary profession. That things infinitely trifling 
in themselves: men, events, societies, phenomena, in no way 
otherwise more valuable than the myriad other things which 
flit around us like the sparrows on the housetop, should be 
glorified, magnified, and perpetuated, set under a literary 
microscope and focussed in the blaze of a literary magic-lantern 
—not for what they are in themselves, but solely to amuse and 
excite the world by showing how it can be done—all this is 
to me so amazing, so heart-breaking, that I forbear now to treat 
it, as I cannot say all that I would. 
The choice of books is really the choice of our education, of a 
moral and intellectual ideal, of the whole duty of man. But 
though I shrink from any so high a theme, a few words are 
needed to indicate my general point of view in the matter. 
In the first place, when we speak about books, let us avoid 
the extravagance of expecting too much from books, the pedant’s 
habit of extolling books as synonymous with education. Books 
are no more education than laws are virtue; and just as profligacy 
lis easy within the strict limits of law, a boundless knowledge of 
books may be found with a narrow education. A man may be, 
s the poet saith, “deep vers’d in books, and shallow in himself.” 
We need to know in order that we may feel rightly and act 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
  318 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
wisely. The thirst after truth itself may be pushed to a degree 
where indulgence enfeebles our sympathies and unnerves us 
in action. Of all men perhaps the booklover needs most to 
be reminded that man’s business here is to know for the sake 
of living; not to live for the sake of knowing. A healthy mode 
of reading would follow the lines of a sound education. And the 
first canon of a sound education is to make it the instrument to 
perfect the whole nature and character. Its aims are compre- 
hensive, not special; they regard life as a whole, not mental 
curiosity; they have to give us, not so much materials, as capaci- 
ties. So that, however moderate and limited the opportunity 
for education, in its way it should be always more or less sym- 
metrical and balanced, appealing equally in turn to the three 
grand intellectual elements—imagination, memory, reflection: 
and so having something to give us in poetry, in history, in 
science, and in philosophy. 
And thus our reading will be sadly one-sided, however vol- 
uminous it be, if it entirely close to us any of the great types 
and ideals which the creative instinct of man has produced, if 
it shut out from us either the ancient world, or other European 
poetry, as important almost as our own. When our reading, 
however deep, runs wholly into “pockets,” and exhausts itself 
in the literature of one age, one country, one type, then we may 
be sure that it is tending to narrow or deform our minds. And 
the more it leads us into curious byways and nurtures us into 
indifference for the beaten highways of the world, the sooner 
we shall end, if we be not specialists and students by profession, 
in ceasing to treat our books as the companions and the solace 
of our lifetime, and in using them as the instruments of a refined 
sort of self-indulgence. 
A wise education, and so judicious reading, should leave 
no great type of thought, no dominant phase of human nature, 
wholly a blank. Whether our reading be great or small, so far 
as it goes, it should be general. If our lives admit of but a 
short space for reading, all the more reason that, so far as may 
be, it should remind us of the vast expanse of human thought, 
and the wonderful variety of human nature.
-P-A-G-E-341
GENERAL READING 319 
To read, and yet so to read that we see nothing but a corner 
of literature, the loose fringe, or flats and wastes of letters, and 
by reading only deepen our natural belief that this island is 
the hub of the universe, and the nineteenth century the only 
age worth notice, all this is really to call in the aid of books to 
thicken and harden our untaught prejudices. Be it imagination, 
memory, or reflection that we address—that is, in poetry, 
history, science, or philosophy—our first duty is to aim at 
knowing something at least of the best, at getting some definite 
idea of the mighty realm whose outer rim we are permitted to 
approach. 
But how are we to know the best; how are we to gain this 
definite idea of the vast world of letters? There are some who 
appear to suppose that the “best” are known only to experts 
in an esoteric way, who may reveal to inquirers what schoolboys 
and betting-men describe as “tips.” There are no “tips” in 
literature; the “best”? authors are never dark horses; we need 
o “crammers” and “coaches” to thrust us into the presence of 
the great writers of all time. “Crammers” will only lead us 
wrong. It is a thing far easier and more common than many 
imagine, to discover the best. It needs no research, no learning, 
and is only misguided by recondite information. The world 
has long ago closed the great assize of letters, and judged the 
first places everywhere. In such a matter the judgment of the 
world, guided and informed by a long succession of accomplished 
critics, is almost unerring. When some Zoilus finds blemishes 
in Homer, and prefers, it may be, the work of some Apollonius 
of his own discovering, we only laugh. There may be doubts 
about the third and the fourth rank; but the first and the second 
are hardly open to discussion. 
The gates which lead to the Elysian fields may slowly wheel 
back on their adamantine hinges to admit now and then some 
new and chosen modern. But the company of the masters 
of those who know, and in especial degree of the great poets, 
is a roll long closed and complete, and they who are of it hold 
ever peaceful converse together. Hence we may find it a useful 
maxim that, if our reading be utterly closed to the great poems
-P-A-G-E-342
320 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
of the world, there is something amiss with our reading. If you 
find Milton, Dante, Calderon, Goethe, so much ‘“Hebrew- 
Greek” to you; if your Homer and Virgil, your Moliére and 
Scott, rest year after year undisturbed on their shelves beside 
your school trigonometry and your old college text-books; if 
you have never opened the “Cid,” the “ Nibelungen,” “Crutve,” 
and “Don Quixote,” since you were a boy, and are wont to 
leave the Bible and the Imitation! for some wet Sunday after- 
noon—know, friend, that your reading can do you little real 
good. Your mental digestion is ruined or sadly out of order. 
No doubt, to thousands of intelligent educated men who call 
themselves readers, the reading through a Canto of “The 
Purgatorio,” or a Boo... of the “Paradise Bost,” is a task as 
irksome as it would be to decipher an ill-written manuscript 
in a language that is almost forgotten. But, although we are 
not to be always reading epics, and are chiefly in the mood for 
slighter things, to be absolutely unable to read Milton or Dante 
with enjoyment, is to be in a very bad way. Aristophanes, 
Theocritus, Boccaccio, Cervantes, Moliére are often as light 
as the driven foam; but they are not light enough for the general 
reader. Their humor is too bright and lovely for the ground- 
lings. They are, alas! “classics,” somewhat apart from our 
everyday ways; they are not banal enough for us; and so for 
us they slumber “unknown in a long night,” just because 
they are immortal poets, and are not scribblers of to-day. 
When will men understand that the reading of great books 
is a faculty to be acquired, not a natural gift, at least not to 
those who are spoiled by our current education and habits of 
life? Ceci twera cela, the last great poet might have said of the 
first circulating library. An insatiable appetite for new novels 
makes it as hard to reacha masterpiece as it seems to a Parisian 
boulevardier to live in a quiet country. Until a man can truly 
enjoy a draught of clear water bubbling from a mountain side, 
his taste is in an unwholesome state. 
And so he who finds the Heliconian spring insipid should

     GENERAL READING 321 
look to the state of his nerves. Putting aside the iced air of 
the difficult mountain tops of epic, tragedy, or psalm, there are 
some simple pieces which may serve as an unerring test of a 
healthy or a vicious taste for imaginative work. If the “Cid,” 
the “Vita Nuova,” the “Canterbury Tales,” Shakespeare’s 
“SOnnets,” and “Lycidas” pall on a man; if he care not for 
Malory’s “Morte d’Arthur” and the “Red Cross Knight”; 
if he thinks “Crusoe” and the “Vicar” books for the young; 
if he thrill not with “The Ode to the West Wind,” and “The 
Ode to a Grecian Urn”; if he have no stomach for “Christabel” 
or the lines written on “The Wye above Tintern Abbey,” he 
should fall on his knees and pray for a cleanlier and quieter 
spirit. ¢ : “ 
The intellectual system of most of us in these days needs 
“to purge and to live cleanly.” Only by a course of treatment 
shall we bring our minds to feel at peace with the grand pure 
works of the world. Something we ought all to know of the 
masterpieces of antiquity, and of the other nations of Europe. 
To understand a great national poet, such as Dante, Calderon, 
Corneille, or Goethe, is to know other types of human civiliza- 
tion in ways which a library of histories does not sufficiently 
teach. The great masterpieces of the world are thus, quite 
apart from the charm and solace they give us, the master 
instruments of a solid education,

of this phase of reading, which is a reply to Harrison’s views, look

SOME HINTS ON READING! 
James Bryce 
[For note on author see page 219. This selection was originally an address 
to the students of Rutgers College, in October, 1911.] 
It has been often said that books do for us to-day what 
universities did in earlier ages. The knowledge that could 
five centuries ago have been obtained only from the lips of a 
teacher, can now be gathered from the printed page. . Never- 
theless, since it is only the most active and most diligent and 
most discerning minds that can dispense with the help and 
guidance of teachers to show them what to read and how to 
read, universities and colleges are scarcely less useful if not quite 
as indispensable to-day as they were before the invention of 
printing. It is, therefore, not unfitting that in your college I 
should be asked to talk to you about books, the way to choose 
them, and the way to draw most profit from them. The very 
abundance of books in our days—a stupefying and terrifying 
abundance—has made it more important to know how to 
choose properly and judiciously among them if one is not to 
spend as much time in the mere choice as in the use. Here 
you have the help of your professors. But here you are only 
beginning the process of education which will go on during the 
rest of your life. By far the largest part of that process will, 
after you have left college, consist in your independent reading, 
so the sooner you form habits of choice and methods of use, 
' the better. 
The first piece of advice I will venture to give you is this: 
Read only the best books. There are plenty of them, far more 
than you will ever find time to read, and when they are to be 
had it is a pity to waste time on any others. 
You may ask what I mean by the best books. Passing by 
for the moment those which in each of the great world-languages 
we call its classics, for to these we shall return presently, I mean

GENERAL READING 323 
by the best those from which you receive most, and can carry 
most away, in the form either of knowledge or of stimulation. 
When you want to learn something about a subject, do not fall 
upon the first book which you have heard named or which pro- 
fesses by its title to deal with that subject. Consult your » 
teacher, or any well-read friend, or the librarian of the nearest 
public library. (One of the greatest services public libraries 
render is that they provide librarians usually competent, and 
I believe always willing, to advise those who apply to them.) 
Be content with nothing less than the very best you can get. 
Time will be saved in the end. 
There is no waste more pitiable than that so often seen when 
some zealous student has, for want of guidance, spent weeks 
or months of toil trying to obtain from a second- or third-rate 
book what he might have found sooner and better in a first- 
rate one. So try to read only what is good. And by “good” 
you will not suppose me to mean what used to be called “im- 
proving books,” books written in a sort of Sunday School 
spirit for the moral benefit of the reader. A book may be ex- 
cellent in its ethical tone, and full of solid information, and yet 
be unprofitable, that is to say, dull, heavy, uninspiring, weari- 
some. Contrariwise, a book is good when it is bright and fresh, 
when it rouses and enlivens the mind, when it provides materials 
on which the mind can pleasurably work, when it leaves the 
reader not only knowing more but better able to use the knowl- 
edge he has received from it. 
Seventy years ago people, or at least those who used then 
to be called the preceptors of youth, talked as if there lay a 
certain virtue in dry books, or at any rate a moral merit in the 
process of plodding through them. It was a dismal mistake, 
which inflicted. upon youth many a dreary hour. The dull 
book is not better than the lively book. Other things being 
equal, it is worse, because it requires more expenditure of 
effort to master such of its contents as are worth remembering. 
If the edge of the tool is blunt, one must put forth more strength, 
and as there is never too much strength, none of it should be 
wasted. It may be asked, “But is not the mental discipline
-P-A-G-E-346
324 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
wholesome?” Yes, effort crowned with victory is a fine thing, 
but since there is plenty of such discipline to be had from the 
better books why go to the worse books for it? 
Sometimes it happens that what you want to learn cannot 
be had except from dry or even from dull treatises. Dryness 
and dullness are not the same thing, for the former quality 
may be due to the nature of the subjectbut the latter is the 
fault of the author. Well, if there is no other book to be found, 
you must make the best of the dry and even of the dull. But 
first make quite sure that there are none better to be had, for 
though in many a subject the really satisfactory book has not 
yet been written, still in most subjects there is a large choice 
between the better and the worse. 
Every book ought to be so composed as to be capable of 
being read with enjoyment by those who bring interest and ca- 
pacity to it. One cannot be playfully various and graphically 
picturesque upon every kind of subject. Once, in a distant 
British colony, a friend of mine was asked by a person who knew 
that he came from the University of Oxford, ‘What do you 
think of Euclid?” My friend replied that Euclid’s “Elements 
of Geometry”—if that was what the question referred to— 
was a valuable treatise, whose reputation had been established 
for mhany centuries. “Yes,” said the questioner, “but what do 
you think of Euclid’s style?” My friend answered that he had 
always thought more about the substance than about the style 
of Euclid, but would.be glad to know his questioner’s opinion. 
“Well,” said the latter, “I consider it quite good style, but too 
systematic.’ Eloquence, variety, and wit are not the particular 
merits we look for in a scientific treatise, but however dry 
geometry or any other subject may appear, there is all the 
difference between a book which is well arranged and well 
expressed, a book which takes a grip of the mind and affords 
the pleasure of following out a line of logical thought, and a 
book which tumbles out facts and ideas in a confused and 
shapeless heap. 
To you undergraduates life now seems a long vista with 
infinite possibilities. But, if you love learning, you will soon
-P-A-G-E-347
  GENERAL READING 325 
find that life is altogether too short for reading half the good 
books from which you would like to cull knowledge. Let not 
an hour of it be wasted on third-rate or second-rate stuff if 
first-rate stuff can be had. Goethe once said of some one he 
knew, “He is a dull man. If he were a book, I would not read 
him.” When you find that a book is poor, and does not give 
you even the bare facts you are in search of, waste no time upon 
it. 
The immensity of the field of reading suggests another 
question. Ought a man to read widely, trying to keep abreast 
of the progress of knowledge and thought in the world at large, 
or is it better that he should confine himself to a very few 
subjects, and to proceed not discursively but upon some regular 
system? 
Each alternative has its advantages, but considering how 
rapidly knowledge is extending itself in all directions, and how 
every branch of it is becoming specialized, we must recognize 
that the range of attainment possible three or even two cen- 
turies ago is now unattainable even by the most powerful and 
most industrious minds. To-day the choice lies between 
superficiality in a larger, and some approach to thoroughness 
in a smaller, number of topics. Between these alternatives 
there can be no doubt as to your choice. Every man ought 
to be thorough in at least one thing, ought to know what exact- 
ness and accuracy mean, ought to be capable by his mastery 
of some one topic of having an opinion that is genuinely his own. 
So my advice to you would be to direct your reading chiefly to 
a few subjects, in one at least of which you may hope to make 
yourself proficient, and as regards other subjects, to be content 
with doing what you can to follow the general march of knowl- 
edge. You will find it hard—indeed impossible—to follow that 
march in the physical sciences, unless you start with some 
special knowledge of one or more of them. Many of the 
branches into which they have been diverging are now so 
specialized that the ordinary reader can hardly comprehend 
the technical terms which modern treatises employ. But as 
respects travel and history and biography, and similarly as 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
  326 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
respects economics, the so-called “sociological subjects,” art, 
and literary criticism, it is possible for a man who husbands his 
time and spends little of it on newspapers or magazines, to find 
leisure for the really striking books that are published on some 
of these topics which lie outside his special tastes. Do not, 
however, attempt to cover even the striking books on all of 
such topics. You will only dissipate your forces. Now and 
then a book appears which everybody ought to read, no matter 
how far it lies out of his range of study. It may be a brilliant 
poem. It may bea treatise throwing new light on some surrent 
question of home or foreign politics, about which every citizen, 
because he is a citizen, ought to try to have an opinion. It 
may be the record of some startling discovery in the realms 
of archeology, for instance, or in some branch of natural 
science. But such books are rare; and in particular the 
epoch-making scientific discoveries are seldom known at the 
time when the world first hears of them to be really epoch- 
making. 
Two questions may, however, have presented themselves to 
you. One is this: Are there not some indispensable books which 
every one is bound to read on pain of being deemed to be not 
an educated man? Certainly there are. Every language has 
its classics which those who speak the language ought to have 
read as a part of a liberal education. In our own tongue we 
have, say, a score of great authors—it would be easy to add 
another dozen, but I wish to be moderate and put the number as 
low as possible—of whose works every one of us is bound to 
have read enough to enable him to appreciate the author’s 
peculiar quality. These of course you must read, though not 
necessarily all or nearly all they have written. Spenser, for 
instance, is an English classic, but even so voracious a reader as 
Macaulay admitted that few could be expected to persevere to 
the end of the “Faery Queene.”” Even smaller is the percentage 
of Dryden’s works which a man may feel bound to read. Do 
not look for an opinion as to the percentage in the case of Robert 
Browning. The sooner you begin to read those who belong 
to this score, the better, for most of them are poets, and youth 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
  
GENERAL READING 327 
is the season in which to learn to love poetry. If you do not 
care for it then, you will hardly do so later. 
The other question is, What about fiction? I can just recall 
an austere time, more than sixty years ago, when in Britain 
not a few moralists and educators were disposed to ban novel- 
reading altogether to young people and to treat it even among 
their elders as an indulgence almost as dangerous as the use of 
cards, dice, and tobacco. Exceptions, however, were made 
even by the sternest of these authorities. I recollect that one 
of them gave this imprimatur to two stories by an estimable 
Scottish authoress—now long forgotten—named Miss Brunton. 
These tales were entitled “Discipline” and “Self-Control,” and 
a perusal of them was well fitted to discourage the young reader 
from indulging any further his taste for imaginary literature. 
Permitted fiction being scanty, I did attack “Self-Control,” 
and just got through it, but “Discipline” was too much for me. 
Fiction is far more read now; being abundant and cheaper since 
it comes in the form of magazines as well as in books. But we 
have no Dickens, no Thackeray, no Hawthorne, no George Eliot. 
Need anything more be said about fiction than that we should 
deal with it just as we should with other kinds of literature? 
Read the best; that is to say, read that from which you can carry 
away something that enlarges the range of your knowledge and 
sets your mind working. A good story, be it a historical romance 
or a picture of contemporary social conditions, gives some- 
thing that is worth remembering. It may be a striking type of 
character, or a view of life and the influences that mold life, 
presented in a dramatic form. Or perhaps the tale portrays 
the aspects of society and manners in some other country, or 
is made a vehicle for an analysis of the heart and for reflections 
that illuminate some of the dark corners of human nature. 
Whichever of them it be that a powerful piece of fiction gives, 
the result is something more powerful than mere transient 
amusement. Knowledge is increased. Thought is set in 
motion. New images rise before us. It is an enrichment of 
the mind to have erected within it a gallery of characters of 
history, to some of us possibly more real. In them we see the

universal traits of human nature and learn to know ourselves 
and those around us better, we comprehend the common tempta- 
tions and aspirations, the mixture of motives, the way in which 
Fortune plays with men. We share the possession of th’s 
gallery with other educated men. It is a part of the common 
stock of the world’s wealth. 
The danger of becoming so fond of fiction as to care for no 
other sort of reading, a malady from which some men and more 
women are said to suffer, will threaten nobody who has formed 
the habit of reading the kind of fiction I am trying to describe, 
because he will enjoy no other kind. A boy or girl can usually 
read any sort of tale be it better or worse written. The story 
is enough for him. As he grows older and has read more and 
more of the best writers, his taste becomes more cultivated 
and exacting. While faults repel him more, merits attract him 
more, because he has become more capable of appreciation. 
At last a poor quality of fiction which is merely commonplace, 
handling threadbare themes in a hackneyed way, the sort of 
fiction into which no incentive or reflected thought has gone, 
comes to bore him. He can no longer read it, because it is too 
dull or too vapid. 
Prose fiction in its higher forms cultivates the imagination 
almost as well as history does, but poetry does this better than 
either. The pleasures of the imagination are among the highest 
we can enjoy. Unless, therefore, any one of you is so unlucky 
as to find no delight in poetry, it will always form a part of your 
reading. Not much of the highest order has been appearing 
in these later days in any country, but there is such an abund- 
ance from former days that you will never want for plenty to 
read and no modern language possesses so much poetry of 
first-rate merit.as does our own. 
It seems a pity that the old practice of learning a good deal of 
poetry by heart should now be falling into disuse, for it stored 
the mind in the early years of life with fine thoughts in fine 
words and helped to form a taste for style, seeing that style 
can rise to greater heights of perfection in poetry than in any 
kind of prose. As to what to read in poetry, there is no need in
-P-A-G-E-351
GENERAL READING 320 
our day to warn any one against reading too much, and there is 
little to say about choice, for you will naturally be drawn first 
to the great and famous classics in our own and other tongues, 
and they will so form your taste that you will know how to 
choose among other verse writers. In particular do not omit 
those few great writers who have attained to a distinctive way 
of looking at the world as a whole (what the Germans call a 
Weltanschauung), those in whose minds and works human nature 
in all its varieties, human life in all its aspects, is mirrored. The 
author, or authors, of the Homeric poems is the earliest example: 
Goethe is one of the latest, and not all are poets, for Cervantes 
is among them. 
A man who does not care for those whom the judgment of 
the world has approved, may conclude that the fault is with 
himself. But it is not always the greatest that give the most 
pleasure. Most of us have some two or three poets not classed 
in the first rank, perhaps writers whose fame has always been 
limited, to whom we frequently return because they express 
thoughts in a way which makes a special appeal to our own 
minds. Look out for these also, and cherish them when you 
have found them. 
Though divers wise and learned men have drawn up lists 
of what they describe as the Best Hundred Books, it may be 
doubted whether such lists have any use beyond that of indicat- 
ing the preferences of their eminent compilers and the use also 
of recalling to the notice of the modern public some remarkable 
works which it has nearly forgotten. The truth is that the 
excellence of a book is not absolute, 7. ¢., the same for all readers 
alike, but rather is relative to the knowledge and capacities and 
environment of the particular reader. Many a book of first- 
rate value to a person prepared by education and special talents 
to appreciate it is useless to others not so prepared. A more 
really interesting inquiry is, What are the books that have made 
most difference to the progress of the world? Such books are 
a part, and a significant part, of world-history, yet some of 
them would interest comparatively few readers to-day. 
The question of how much time should be devoted to the 
. 
 
-P-A-G-E-352
  
330 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
classics of other countries than our own is too large a one for 
me to enter on. Enough to say that whoever knows Latin or 
Greek or Italian or French or German or Spanish or Icelandic, 
will not need to be told that he ought to be just as anxious to | 
know the master-pieces in those languages as those in his own. 
The ancient classics in particular give something which no 
modern literature supplies. 
From considering What to read, let us go on to consider 
How to read. Here my advice to you would be, Read with a 
purpose. Bend your mind upon the book. Read it so as to 
get out of it the best it has to give you. You may accept this 
advice as applicable to what is read for information, but you may 
think it superfluous if the book is a story or other work read 
for amusement, because presumably 20 one will persevere with 
such a book unless it interests him. Yet even where the'aim 
is amusement and the book a work of fiction one man may, if he 
read it in the right way, extract more benefit as well as more 
pleasure than another would do. If the story is worth reading 
it is so because it not only appeals to our curiosity, but also 
because it pleasurably stirs our thought. 
With other kinds of literature, with science or philosophy or 
history or economics, the worth of the book is to be measured 
by what you can carry away from it, and that depends mainly 
on the spirit in which-you read. The book, as already observed, 
must have quality enough to stimulate thought, to give you what 
is called a mental reaction. But however good the quality, 
the reaction will not follow unless you address your mind to the 
subject. The purpose must be either to get something— 
whether facts or ideas—which you can add to your store of 
knowledge or else to receive a stimulus which will quicken your 
own powers of thinking and feeling. These two benefits 
usually go together. It is not the quantity of reading that 
counts, but the quantity and the intensity of thought that are 
evoked. Nothing is gained by skimming over hundreds of 
thousands of pages of print unless something remains from the 
process. So if after having honestly applied your intellect to 
a book you do not find anything you care to carry away, drop 
 
-P-A-G-E-353
  GENERAL READING 331 
it. Either it is not worth further effort, or it may be outside 
the range of your appreciation. 
You will not, however, fancy that all books you may have to 
consult deserve careful study. If thoroughness is a virtue 
to be cultivated, still more is time a thing to be saved. The old 
maxim, ‘Whatever is worth doing is worth doing well,” is less 
true than it seems, and has led many people into a lamentable 
waste of time. Many things are worth doing if you ean do them 
passably well with a little-time and effort, which are not worth 
doing tho:oughly if so to do requires much time and effort. 
Time is the measure of everything in life, and every kind of 
work ought to be adjusted to it. One of the commonest mis- 
takes we all make is spending ourselves on things whose value 
is below the value of time they require. Many a book may be 
worth reading rapidly so as to extract from it the few important 
facts it contains, and yet be by no means worth a prolonged 
study. Economize time in reading as in everything else. The 
adage that Time is Money falls far short of the truth. Time is 
worth more than money because by its judicious employment 
more enjoyment can be secured than money can purchase. 
One of the less fortunate results of the large amount of matter 
which the printing-press turns out in our time is the tendency 
it has bred to read everything hastily and unthinkingly. The 
man who glances through several newspapers in the morning 
and two or three magazines in the evening forms the habit of 
inattention, or, more correctly, half attention. He reads with 
no intention of remembering anything except what directly 
and urgently bears upon his own business, and when in the scanty 
leisure which business and the practice of reading newspapers 
and magazines leave him, he takes up a book, this habit of half 
attention prevents him from applying his mind to what he 
reads. Instead of stimulating thought, constant reading of 
this kind deadens it, and the quantity of reading and the quan- 
tity of thinking are apt to be in inverse ratio to one another. 
To say, “Don’t read without thinking,” might be deemed 
to be that useless thing, a Counsel of Perfection; but I may say 
“Beware of the Reading Habit.” It is one of the curses of our 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  332 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
age. What is wanted to-day is less printing and less reading, 
but more thinking. Reading is easy, and thinking is hard work, 
but the one is useless without the other. 
You may ask what is the best way of trying sc to read books 
as to be able to retain the best they givegus. If the book be 
one you wish to know with absolute thoroughness, as students 
at Oxford University were in my time expected to know Aris- 
totle’s Ethics and the history of Thucydides for our degree 
examination, you will find it a good plan to read over every day 
all that you read the day before. At first this is irksome, but 
it fixes things in your mind and is a saving in the long run. 
Everybody he his own devices for recording what he deems 
best in what he reads, but I can recommend that of making 
very short notes, or references, on the fly leaf (or leaves) at the 
end and beginning of a volume of the most important facts or 
views it contains, noting the page on which it occurs, so that 
one can refer promptly to the things which struck one at the 
time. Where a work is either of exceptional merit for its fer- 
tility in suggestion, or is specially rich in out-of-the-way facts, 
it may be worth while to bind in additional fly leaves. Should 
the book be not one’s own but borrowed from a friend or a 
library, one must of course make the notes or references in a 
manuscript note-book, and in that case, since the treatise will 
not be at hand to refer to, it becomes necessary to make a some- 
what fuller abstract of the facts it is desired to remember. The 
advantage of either method is that the process of compressing 
the fact or view into the fewest possible words helps to fix it in 
the memory. I remember cases in which eight or ten entries 
represented the total results of reading a book of four hundred 
octavo pages, yet those entries might serve to make some dark 
things clear. 
The late Lord ‘Acton, the most learned man I ever knew, was 
in the habit of copying out on slips of paper passages or sentences 
which he thought valuable from all the volumes he perused. He 
had hundreds of cardboard boxes filled with these slips, the boxes 
being labeled with the titles of their subjects; and he seemed to 
know how to lay his hand upon any extract he wanted. Few, 
 
-P-A-G-E-355
  GENERAL READING 333 
however, could hope to bring leisure and industry like his to the 
accumulation of such a mass of knowledge; and he spent so much 
time in the process of gathering the opinions of others that he 
had little left for using them or for giving the world the fruit of 
his own thoughts, oj en far better worth having than that which 
he had plucked from other orchards. 
There are those who keep notebooks in which they enter 
the most remarkable facts or aphorisms or statements of doc- 
trine and opinion which they encounter in the course of their 
reading. For persons fortunate enough to have formed method- 
ical habits this may be a good plan. 
Ought reading to be systematic? Should a man lay down a 
scheme and confine himself to one or more subjects in which he 
can become proficient rather than spread himself out in super- 
ficial sciolism over a large number? 
For many of us Life answers this question by requiring 
attention to be devoted primarily to books which bear upon 
our occupation or are connected with it. For others again 
pronounced tastes point out certain lines of reading as those in 
which they ‘will find most pleasure. Yet there is also a third 
class whom neither their avocations nor any marked personal 
preferences guide in any particular direction. -My advice to 
these would be: If you have not got a definite taste, try to acquire 
one. Find some pursuit or line of study which you can relish, 
and give to it most of your spare time. It will be a constant 
spring of pleasure, an occupation in solitude, a distraction from 
worries, even a consolation in misfortune, to have something 
unconnected with one’s daily work to which one can turn for 
change and refreshment of spirit. Some branch of natural 
history, or some one of the physical sciences, is perhaps the best 
for this purpose, but any branch of history or archeology or 
art (including, as one of the very best, music) will serve. When 
one has such a pursuit or taste, it naturally becomes the central 
line which a man’s reading follows. In advising a concentra- 
tion of study upon some few topics, I do not suggest that you 
should cease to interest yourselves in the general movements 
of the world. Everyone ought to try to keep abreast of his 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
| 
334 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
time, so far at least as not to be ignorant of the great advances 
that are being made. Of most of these you will not be able to 
know much, but the more you can know, the better, so long as 
you do not scatter and dissipate your efforts in such wise as to 
become a mere smatterer. 
There is a maxim which, like the other venerable dictum 
already referred to, sounds good but has often done harm. (A 
book might be written with the title Moral Maxims and the 
Mischief They,Do.) You all remember the lines: 
A little learning is a dangerous thing; 
Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring. 
Wig fa 
With all respect to the poet, this is by no means true. A 
little learning is not dangerous so long as you know that it is 
little. Danger begins with thinking you know much more 
than you do. It is not knowledge, be it great or small, but the 
conceit of knowledge, that misleads men: and the best remedy 
against this is not ignorance, but the knowing some one thing 
really well. Thoroughness in one subject enables a man to 
recognize his scantiness of attainment in other subjects, not to 
add that to have learned any one thing well helps him in dealing . 
with whatever else he touches, since he learns to discern more 
quickly what is essential, and to make sure that his knowledge, 
even if it remains elementary, is not merely superficial. 
Do not be surprised if after advising you to read thoroughly 
I also advise you to learn to read swiftly. There is no incon- 
sistency, for thoroughness depends not so much on the time 
spent on a piece of work as upon the intensity wherewith the 
mind is concentrated upon it. One man will read a book in 
half as many hours as another, and yet know more of what is in 
the book; and this because of his superior power of turning 
upon it the full stream of his mental energy. Only exceptional 
minds possess this gift in high measure, as did Macaulay, who 
read a book so swiftly that he seemed to turn the pages almost 
without pausing, taking in at one glance all that was in them,
-P-A-G-E-357
  
GENERAL READING 335 
and yet carrying away all that was worth remembering. But 
you can cultivate the gift by practice, and it deserves cultivat- 
ing, for it means better results with less time spent. 
The counsel of swift reading is, of course, applicable only to 
books which are read chiefly for their facts or their views, not 
to those whose merit lies largely in their style. It would be 
folly to gallop through Virgil or Keats or Charles Lamb or 
’ Heinrich Heine or Chateaubriand: Not in poetry only must 
one move deliberately, but also in reading fine and finished 
prose, where every word has its fitting place in the sentence, and 
its due effect in calling up subtle associations and in touching, , 
however delicately,sthe spring of emotion. 
Fi .cily, let me suggest that you read with independence. 
There are various spirits in which a book may be approached. 
One must not be captious, hunting out mistakes or blemishes. 
But neither must one submissively assume that the author is 
always right. No author, however great, is exempt from error. 
True it is that modesty is always in order, and deference due 
to writers of established credit. We must take them as likely 
to be wiser than we are. Nevertheless, if you wish to profit by 
your reading, do not forget to scrutinize each argument as it is 
presented, each inference drawn, each maxim delivered, to see 
if it be justified by the facts. Sound criticism seeks rather to 
discover and appreciate merits than to note faults; but however 
ready we may be to admire, we must test our author as we go 
along, and make sure that the view we accept from him is 
formed not because he had given it but because he has con- 
vinced us that it is correct. As your forefathers said that per- 
petual vigilance is the price of freedom, so you may say that it 
is also the price of learning. In a free country every citizen is 
responsible for the formation of opinions, and must take them 
neither from newspapers nor from platform speeches. So in the 
domain of knowledge a man will lose half the benefit of his study 
if he reads in a passively receptive way, neglecting to apply his 
own judgment. Often he will not be able to test his author. 
Often when he differs from his author the author will be right, 
and he wrong in venturing to differ. Nevertheless, such error  
-P-A-G-E-358
  336 -COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
is better than an indolent acquiescence which brings to bear no 
independent thought. 
To say this is to repeat in different words the remark that 
the reading which counts is the reading which, in making a 
man think, stirs and exercises and polishes the edge of his mind. 
The end of study is not to possess knowledge as a man possesses 
the coins in his purse, but to make knowledge a part of ourselves, 
that is, to turn knowledge into thought, as the food we eat is 
turned into the life-giving and nerve-nourishing blood. It is 
to have a mind so stored and equipped that it shall be to each 
man, as to the imprisoned sage, his kingdom, of which no one 
can deprive him. When you have begun by forming the habit 
of thinking as you read, and exercising your own judgment 
freely, though modestly, you will find your footing grow firmer 
and surer as you advance, and will before long know for your- 
selves what to read and how to read. Life has few greater 
pleasures. t

ON THE READING OF NEWSPAPERS! 
Henry Davin THOREAU 
[Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) was the eccentric American writer 
and naturalist. His ruling passions—his love for independence and sim- 
plicity and his love of nature—were perhaps most completely and naturally 
gratified when he spent more than two years in a little hut which he built 
on Walden pond, near Concord, tilling a small plot of ground, and depending 
for sustenance and enjoyment almost entirely upon his own resources. As 
he himself says, “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, 
to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what 
it had to teach.” He was not a misanthropist as some have thought. He 
simply preferred solitary communion with nature to human society. “The 
man I meet,” he said, “is seldom so instructive as the silence he breaks.” 
Thoreau was a man whose personal views and tenets were carried out to 
the point of eccentricity; but his life was blameless and he was loved and 
respected by all who knew him.] 
I do not know but it is too much to read one newspaper a week. 
I have tried it recently, and for so long it seems to me that I 
have not dwelt in my native region. The sun, the clouds, the 
snows, the trees, say not so much to me. You cannot serve 
. two masters. It requires more than a day’s devotion to know 
and to possess the wealth of a day. 
We may well be ashamed to tell what things we have read or 
heard in our day. I do not know why my news should be so 
trivial,—considering what one’s dreams and expectations are, 
why the developments should be so paltry. The news we hear, 
for the most part, is not news to our genius. It is the stalest 
repetition. You are often tempted to ask why such stress is 
laid on a particular experience which you have had,—that, after 
twenty-five years, you should meet Hobbins, Registrar of Deeds, 
1 Reprinted by permission from Miscellanies, in Thoreau’s Collected Works, Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.  
-P-A-G-E-360

again on the sidewalk. Have you not budged an inch, then? 
Such is the daily news. Its facts appear to float in the atmo- 
sphere, insignificant as the sporules of fungi, and impinge on 
some neglected thallus, or surface of our minds, which affords a 
basis for them, and hence a parasitic growth. We should wash 
ourselves clean of such news. Of what consequence, though 
our planet explode, if there is no character involved in the 
explosion? In health we have not the least curiosity about 
such events. We do not live for idle amusement. I would not 
run round a corner to see the world blow up. 
Not without a slight shudder at the danger, I often perceive 
how near I had come to admitting into my mind the details 
of some trivial affair,—the news of the street, and I am aston- 
ished to observe how willing men are to lumber their minds 
with suck ~ubbish,—to permit idle rumors and incidents of the 
most insignificant kind to intrude on ground which should be 
sacred to thought. Shall the mind be a public arena, where the 
affairs of the street and the gossip of the tea table chiefly are 
discussed? Or shall it be a quarter of heaven itself,—an hype- 
thral temple, consecrated to the service of the gods? I find it so 
difficult to dispose of the few facts which to me are significant, 
that I hesitate to burden my attention with those which are 
insignificant, which only a divine mind could illustrate. Such is 
for the most part the news in newspapers and conversation. 
It is important to preserve the mind’s chastity in this respect. 
Think of admitting the details of a single case of the criminal 
court into our thoughts, to stalk profanely through their very 
sanctum sanctorum for an hour, ay, for many hours! to make a 
very barroom of the mind’s inmost apartment, as if for so long 
the dust of the street had occupied us,—the very street itself, 
with all its travel, its bustle and filth, had passed throughout 
thoughts’ shrine! Would it not be an intellectual and moral 
suicide? When I have been compelled to sit spectator and audi- 
tor in a court room for some hours, and have seen my neighbors, 
who are not compelled, stealing in from time to time, and tip- 
toeing about with washed hands and faces, it has appeared to 
my mind’s eye that, when they took off their hats, their ears 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
GENERAL READING 339 
suddenly expanded into vast hoppers for sound, between which 
even their narrow heads were crowded. Like the vanes of 
windmills, they caught the broad but shallow stream of sound, 
which, after a few titillating gyrations in their coggy brains, 
passed out the other side. I wondered if, when they got home, 
they were as careful to wash their ears as before their hands 
and faces. It has seemed to me at such a time that the auditors 
and the witnesses, the jury and the counsel, the judge and the 
criminal at the bar,—if I may presume him guilty before he is 
convicted,—were all equally criminal, and a thunderbolt might, 
be expected: to descend and consume fen altogether. 
By all kinds of traps and signboards, threatening the extreme 
penalty of the divine law, exclude such trespassers from the only 
ground which can be sacred to you. It is so hard to forget what 
it is worse than useless to remember! If I am to be a thorough- 
fare, I prefer that it be of the mountain brooks, the Parnassian 
streams, and not the town sewers. ‘There is inspiration, that 
gossip which comes to the ear of the attentive mind from the 
courts of heaven. There is the profane and stale revelation of 
the barroom and the police court. The same ear is fitted to 
receive both communications. Only the character of the hearer 
determines to which it shall be open, and to which closed. I 
believe that the mind can be permanently profaned by the habit 
of attending to trivial things, so that all our thoughts shall be 
tinged with triviality. Our very intellect shall be macadamized, 
as it were,—its foundation broken into fragments for the wheels 
of travel to roll over; and if you would know what will make the 
most durable pavement, surpassing rolled stones, spruce blocks, 
and asphaltum, you have only to look into some of our minds 
which have been subjected to this treatment so long. 
If we have thus desecrated ourselves,—as who has not?—the 
remedy will be by wariness and devotion to reconsecrate our- 
selves, and make once more a fane of the mind. We should 
treat our minds, that is, ourselves, as innocent and ingenuous 
children, whose guardians we are, and be careful what objects 
and what subjects we thrust on their attention. Read not the 
Times. Read the Eternities. Conventionalities are at length  
-P-A-G-E-362

as bad as impurities. Even the facts of science may dust the 
mind by their dryness, unless they are in a sense effaced each 
morning, or rather rendered fertile by the dews of fresh and living 
truth. Knowledge does not come to us by details, but in flashes 
of light from heaven. Yes, every thought that passes through 
the mind helps to wear and tear it, and to deepen the ruts, which, 
as in the streets of Pompeii, evince how much it has been used. 
How many things there are concerning which we might well 
deliberate whether we had better know them,—had better let 
their peddling carts be driven, even at the slowest trot or walk, 
over that bridge of glorious span by which we trust to pass at 
last from the farthest brink of time to the nearest shore of 
eternity! Have we no culture, no refinement,—but skill only 
to live coarsely and serve the Devil?—to acquire a little worldly 
wealth, or fame, or liberty, and make a false show with it, as if 
we were all husk and shell, with no tender and living kernel 
to us? Shall our institutions be like those chestnut burs which 
contain abortive nuts, perfect only to prick the fingers?

VALUE OF THE COLLEGE FRATERNITY! 
ELBripce CoLsy 
  
[Elbridge Colby (189 ) is an instructor in the English department 
of Columbia University. During his undergraduate career at Columbia 
he was active in many phases of college life. The official posts which he 
held in his fraternity were such as to take him a great deal to other 
Eastern colleges. His discussion of the fraternity is therefore of interest 
as representing the views of a recent graduate who has seen much of 
college and fraternity life.] 
It is manifestly unfair that the American college fraternity 
should have been advertised throughout the country in its 
worst light—and only so. Such books as Stover at Yale and 
the more recent Ze Ice Lens, both of which have attained a wide 
notoriety among all persons interested in the college world, 
are essentially false as typical pictures of college life, and 
especially of the fraternity life for which they have been readily 
taken by an eager public. Yet it seems to be human nature to 
accept such things on faith. In this matter, people have grasped 
at the faintest suggestions of wrong-doing and held them up as 
representative conduct, just as the “yellow journalism” of the 
Rosenthal case and the “graft” exposures made the honest, 
hard-worked, underpaid body of the New York metropolitan 
police suffer scorching blasts of undeserved criticism. Thus 
Thoreau never read newspapers because he said that news was 
nothing more than gossip, and gossip is never representative. 
So, the fraternity has been the victim of a kind of yellow 
journalism—of a very pernicious kind, for the permanency 
and dignity of a published book over the passing news-sheet 
seemed to lend weight and authority to the arguments advanced.

  342 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS “|', 
In the first place, Yale College presents a poor example of 
the conditions of fraternity life, for there are, drawing from the 
personnel of the college, few real fraternities, as the word is 
used country-wide. These few restrict elections to no class and 
to no particular period of the year; they take men in for the 
whole remainder of the academic career and, demanding con- 
tinued allegiance, do not allow their own prestige to be dimmed 
by the assumed importance of the “senior” elections. The 
Yale organizations, other than these, with their present form 
and meaning resulting from purely local conditions, and some 
of them entirely dissimilar from chapters which bear the same 
fraternity name in other colleges, are the senior “societies” 
and the junior “societies.” The official regulation that Yale 
College men cannot live in fraternity houses makes a sharp 
distinction between Yale College “fraternities” and the fra- 
ternities at other colleges, a distinction evident in the unique 
character of the Yale chapter houses, called “Tombs.” The 
fraternity situation is thus different at Yale than elsewhere; 
and it is unfortunate that the value and the influence of fra- 
ternities should be in this way misrepresented to a reading 
public who do not realize that what they discuss is peculiarly 
a Yale problem and that the same arguments do not apply at 
all, or at least not in the same way, at other colleges. 
In Yale College, where none of the men live in the fraternity 
houses and where the fraternity membership roll is especially 
large, the fraternity has become largely an occasional thing, 
a sort of club for purely social purposes. On the other hand, 
this social side of the fraternity is but a small fraction of the 
part the fraternity plays at Columbia, at Dartmouth, at La- 
fayette, at Syracuse, at Pennsylvania, at Wesleyan, at Trinity, 
at Cornell—in fact at practically every college except Yale. 
Even at Yale, the specific college “society” is not the typical 
organization. And yet, it is this purely social side of fraternities 
that is flayed by criticism; it is the social side that is held up 
before horrified fathers, mothers, sisters, cousins, and aunts as a 
picture of the horribly profligate life led by the college boy 
away from home.

It would perhaps be best if we made ourselves perfectly clear 
from the start with respect to the two books above mentioned. 
The Ice Lens concerns itself with social life in the Sheffield 
Scientific School organizations which are of the customary 
fraternity type. Our objection to this book is that the im- 
pression it attempts to convey is untrue and that the charges 
it brings are unjust. It will be our purpose in this paper to show 
the value of the fraternity—the fraternity to be of this type— 
to show something of the good influences which the fraternity 
body aims to effect. Some fraternities may fall short of their 
ideals occasionally, but none lose sight of them. The Ice 
Lens emphasizes the evil and forgets the ideal toward which 
these bodies strive. 
Stover at Yale concerns itself with the purely social en- 
vironment created by the Yale academic societies. Our objec- 
tion to this book is that its wide circulation has given to the 
American public an untrue view—the Yale College “societies” 
therein represented are not in any sense representative of fra- 
ternities. The aims of our American national college 
fraternities are far more serious and far loftier than 
those merely pleasurable ones which both of these volumes 
depict. 
To group together a small number of men with fairly similar 
tastes and ideas, to unite them in view of a common ideal, to¢— 
have them live together—this is the great educational advantage 
of the fraternity. Men must work together as well as play 
together before they can know and appreciate one another. It 
is necessary that people should realize from the start that there is 
a bigger and broader meaning to the fraternity influence than 
the sheer quest of pleasure upon which The Ice Lens dwells. 
They should realize that most of the American national college 
fraternities have worthy and high ideals up to which they strive 
to live, and that the real molding of character comes through 
the intimacies of continued companionship, not through the 
passing acquaintanceships of frivolous moments. The true 
comradeship—not merely the “good fellow” sort of a feeling, 
persisting only during an evening of jollity spent together—the

true comradeship is the bond which unites brother with brother 
in a real fraternity. 
“Amici usque ad aras,”” 
they sing in the words of the old song: Friends even to the altars 
of sacrifice. 
There are three dominant elements in the influence which 
a worthy fraternity exerts upon its members and these elements 
are, respectively, of a social, intellectual, and fraternal nature. 
We will discuss them in turn. 
The exuberance, the ebullient spirits, the rash desires, the 
decided aversions, the lights and shadows of mingling timidity 
and boldness, the abandonment of enthusiasm, the sheer 
delight in living for its own sake, the sowing of “wild oats,” the 
emphasis on the pleasures rather than on the obligations of 
life, irresponsiblity, thoaghtlessness, even vice—these have 
been familiarly and frequently attributed to youth. The period 
of adolescence is a very important one, for it is then that our 
young men, in response to a healthy curiosity, come to know 
the world, come to a full cognizance of facts and the relations 
between facts, to an appreciation of the actuality and the 
. ideality of life. 
Wide experience is very valuable in character formation and 
the American college, with its mixture of types, forms a splendid 
crucible for the melting and tempering of the metals. In like 
wise, the fraternity, smaller, more compact, more intimate and 
more intense in the relations it fosters, is the ideal point of con- 
tact, the perfect spot for the study under correction, and not 
merely the slight observation, of our fellow men. Into the 
fraternity chapter—the one of the present writer, for example— 
there have come from far distant places young men who learn to 
understand, to appreciate, to sympathize with, to know, diverse 
types in one another; and who are, thereby, better fitted to go 
out and contact the diverse types of the world. They are| 
learning new situations and are increasing their range of adapt- 
ability. -

Some had come from quiet rural homes of up-state provinces 
to the north; some had come from the respectability and com- 
placency of the old New England towns; others had come 
steeped in the vigorous progressivism of the west, even from 
California; and not a few, quick, alert, with the urban habit of 
mind, sons of honored Columbia alumni, had come out of the 
great metropolis. These men, bringing variant provincial 
ideals and curious home customs, are joined together for four 
years. They influence, instruct, enlighten, inspire; and observe 
one another, and in the process they learn Life. 
A classmate of the present writer has said in a recent essay: 
“All the different traits of our nature must get their airing 
through friends. . . . We let ourselves out piecemeal, it seems 
—each friend calls out some particular trait in us, and it re- 
quires the whole chorus fitly to teach us what we are. . . . 
A man with a few friends is only half-dgveloped; there are whole 
sides of his nature which are locked‘up and have never been 
expressed. He cannot unlock them himself, he cannot even 
discover them; friends alone can stimulate him and open them.” 
According to this conception, a friendship is now seen to be 
valuable both subjectively and objectively, as a form of self- 
impression and as a form of self-expression. The membership 
in a fraternity prefaces the relations between friends and obvi- . 
ates the necessity of introductory stages. The advantage of 
the fraternity, both in the contact with a multiplicity of types — 
and in the intensity of personal feelings, is that there is no time 
lost in progression from the initial acquaintance. Formalities 
can be immediately brushed aside and the direct personal in- 
fluence can begin_at once, and can be truer and less artificial 
from the start. “The wearing of the same badge is a pledge and 
surety of a sincere mutual interest; it forms a valid introduction 
to the most delicate subject; it premises the ensuing discussion 
with an authorized and expected sympathy. .This is one thing 
which the fraternity has to offer more than friendship, this is 
one difference between the relationship among fraternity brothers 
and that among those who are simply classmates, it is one con- 
tribution Which the fraternity makes to the college world.

Then, too, the younger men can go beyond the limits of their class 
and meet the older on common ground and learn from them. 
We live our truest lives with our friends, for in them we 
express ourselves and from them we add to ourselves. No 
man is sufficient unto himself; he must be assisted and supported 
by his friends and he must assist and support them. Thus, in 
the social relationship—and a state of society exists wherever 
two or three are gathered together—in the social relationship, 
we add to our knowledge of our fellows, to our consciousness 
and appreciation of the world and of ourselves. Dear old 
Doctor Johnson delighted in “the endearing elegance of fem- 
inine friendship” and the fraternity man of to-day must have 
his teas, his dances, his theater parties, his “ladies’ nights.” 
There is the nobler side of man’s nature which the gentler sex 
does much to develop. So, periodically, sisters and sweethearts, 
mothers and fiancées, raid our rooms and laugh at our interior 
decorations. They peep into the pantry and wonder how a 
room so small can hold food enough for so many hungry boys; 
they look out of our windows and watch the far lights twinkling 
across the river. There are, besides the fine feminine influences, 
strong masculine ones, emanating from man-and-man compan- 
ionship. These are so commonly emphasized that we scarce 
need to rehearse the succession of platitudes. One thing in 
addition, however, the national fraternity gives. If the differ- 
ent universities have different characteristics, if they develop 
types, if there is a “Yale man,” a “Harvard man,” a “Columbia 
man,” and so forth, to go on visits from college to college, from 
chapter to chapter, and to stay for a short time at these places, 
living the life of the student—this is valuable educational 
experience. In the fraternity with strong “national spirit” 
such visits are frequent and, aside from the fact that the wel- 
come accorded the visitor is intrinsically pleasing, these trips 
do much to broaden and enrich the character of the traveler, 
as well as to provide him with much specific information about 
Ithaca, Syracuse, and New Haven. Thus, on the social side 
of fraternity life, there are many serious parts to play; and the 
game is worth the candle.

Our classmate says, in another of his essays: “The sins and 
excesses of hot-blooded youth are a by-word; and youth 
would not seem to be youth without its carnality and extrava- 
gance. It is fortunate that youth is able to spend that ex- 
travagance partly in idealism.” The fraternity, to the present 
writer, has stood for two things, for restraint and aspiration: 
it has provided idealism for his extravagance of spirit. Of 
course, from the very nature of things, he can know very little 
of other fraternities than his own. He does know, however, 
that many of them very commendably place careful restrictions 
on the conduct of men within The House, that very many of 
them prohibit drinking and gambling within The House, and 
that very many of them, through special committees of upper- 
classmen, watch, exhort, and actually assist those with poor 
standing in academic work.| Earnest effort is made to direct 
the scattered enthusiasm of the underclassmen to proper ends 
and to prevent the youngsters from “drifting along” without 
serious purpose. Making allowances for a few exceptions—to 
err is human—we can safely deny with vigor the charges that 
the fraternity stands for little else than immorality, laziness, 
and vice. In reality, the fraternity as a social force is more 
largely used than abused. 
Any persons who will trouble themselves to read over the 
pamphlet reports of the various committees to the Inter-Fra- 
ternity Conference which met last in New York at the University 
Club in November, 1912, may easily see that fraternities to-day 
have serious intent and honest purpose. From statistics there 
presented we learn that fraternities are examining themselves 
and their collegiate conditions in a critical spirit, that careful 
investigations are usually made of academic standings of all 
men in the chapters, that effective codperation is frequently in 
evidence between the chapter hierarchy and the academic 
authorities. At many institutions averages are published to 
show the relative grades of fraternity and non-fraternity men 
and to compare the records of men in the various Greek-letter 
societies.¢ It is splendid to note that many fraternities have 
faculty advisers and that definite steps are taken to guard

_vagainst scholastic failuréy A dean recently sent a letter to a 
prominent upperclassman in each of the different chapters at his 
college, asking for codperation “in seeing that the entering 
students ... . are impressed with the importance of making a 
good start in their academic work. It is a poor investment to 
initiate a student who is compelled to leave the university in 
February or June. ... We feel that the older men in the 
fraternity can do a great deal to improve conditions.” The 
present writer knows that at least one of these letters bore 
immediate fruit in causing the spurring on of a somewhat de- 
linquent “Scholarship Committee.” And so on, through all the 
questionnaire answers presented to the New York Inter-Fra- 
ternity Conference, we find the same story—consistent coéper- 
ation. 
As regards conduct of the fraternity houses, there is prac- 
tically no supervision by the college administration, Reasons 
given for this were lack of precedent and lack of occasion for 
interference, and the presence of voluntary and adequate alumni 
supervision. The answer returned by one college was: “We 
do not impress uniform house rules on the fraternities because 
I found that the rules they themselves had in force were suffi- 
cient.” From the same pamphlet report, we learn that the 
old-time enmities have disappeared and that, at a great majority 
of the colleges, there are in existence inter-fraternity agreements 
or conferences of more or less importance. Though these 
agreements sometimes concern themselves merely with mutua) 
assistance in telephone arrangements or in the purchase of such 
supplies as coal, or perhaps with formal “rushing agreements,” 
the exchange from hostility to friendliness is obvious and note- 
worthy. There is always a strong sense of the necessity or 
maintaining the dignity of the fraternity in the eyes of other 
“Greeks;” and this feeling avails much in obviating disorderly 
conduct about the house. In fact, the whole tone of the few 
pamphlets issued by the 1912 Inter-Fraternity Conference, to 
which we have referred, would indicate that, though the in- 
vestigations have shown matters to be very little amiss, there 
is still abroad a beneficial spirit of self-criticism.

Youth is the age of many awakenfags. Before the rapidly 
unfolding panorama of personalities and events, amid a curious 
jumble of experiences, the member of the rising generation 
must win to a firm station of spirit. In his own mind hetero- 
geneity and confusion, of ideas and ideals,. must give place to 
consistence and order. In the colleges the fraternity stands 
for a coérdination and a settling; it takes the young man “in 
four of the best years of his life” and helps him to understandj-——~ 
and to become what he seriously intends to be. 
At the dinner table, in the afternoon after work is over, all 
that is needed is for some one to give the proper turn to the 
conversation and a spirited discussion will ensue in which all 
will be interested, and from which all will be instructed. “ Any- 
one who has had anything to do with the formulation of critical 
theories” —anyone who has looked over the lives of the Gon- 
court brothers or of Maxime Ducamp, or the story of the Pre- 
. Raphaelite Brotherhood—anyone who has ever familiarized 
himself with the personnel and the talk of the evenings at the 
house of Charles Lamb—anyone who has read in the history 
of rationalism of the twice-a-week dinners given by the Baron 
d’Holbach where assembled Diderot, Rousseau, Helviteus, 
Raynal, and many ancther noted Frenchman, where went 
noted travelers passing through Paris, Hume, Beccaria, Franklin, 
and Priestly, to visit the charmed circle—anyone who has 
studied British radicalism and contemplated the prominent 
réles played by such men as Horn Tooke, Thomas Holcroft, 
and the young Wordsworth, and the manner in which the ideas 
of these men hark back to simple dinner parties with Godwin— 
anyone who has known and thought of these things will know 
how greatly the talk of a few men, of a small group, of 
a brotherhood or even “the exchange of ideas of two or three 
friends will end in putting vague ideas into words and from words 
into action.” In the history of art, of literature and of politics 
there are many records of enthusiasitc friendships and warm 
discussions that have ended in great ideas. Many an informal 
evening has resulted in the organization and the expression of 
as many worthy ideas as a university lecture. This is the chief
-P-A-G-E-372
  350 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
intellectual stimulus of the fraternity, aside from the mere 
committee-work of assisting men poor in curricular work. 
We speak now of the purely fraternal relationship. 
It is more significant than these other matters of society and 
intellect. It is the essence of the fraternity, the brotherhood 
in the fullest sense of the word. The social side represents 
friendship; the intellectual, community of interest; the fraternal, 
love. The spirit of the fraternity is not of time or condition, of 
place or circumstance. Stevenson wrote to William Ernest 
Henly in 1881: “Times change, opinions vary to their opposites 
—and what can be more encouraging than to find the friend 
who was welcome at one age, still welcome at another?” The 
fraternal bond is this sort of sublimated friendship:—it is 
Platonic love in the sense in which Plato meant it, the love of 
one man for another. This is the ideal of fraternity; its ex- 
pression is in the treatment of the brother. 
Anatole France has remarked that “every creature in the, 
world, however small, is at the center of the universe.” The 
field, the scope, the world of each person is made up of his 
personal experiences; and friendship is but an experience. Our 
classmate essayist has admitted that “our friends must be pointed 
in the same direction in which we are going.” i 
Circumstances of accidental association and separation may 
govern our friendships but not our loves. In the fraternity, 
an indissoluble tie always unites brother with brother; there 
is always a commonalty of opinion on certain of the deep and 
fundamenial things of the spirit. Founded ona clear conception 
of the meaning and purpose of life, the fraternal bond premises 
every meeting, every renewal of acquaintance, with agreement 
on the intimate and personal motives and ideals. At the 
fraternity home, in the quiet of the study hour, before the 
evening fire, when we have eaten, talked, walked, slept with a 
man of our own age and with our own or like interests, when we 
have lived with him in high-light and shadow, only then can 
we appreciate, understand, love and serve our friend. We can 
help him as only he can help us. The bond of the fraternity 
is sufficient introduction for any heart-to-heart talk, for be-

stowal of advice or request for assistance. It means mutual 
cism_and-mutuathelp. It means a similarity of inspiration 
aspiration. It increases the opportunities for close in- 
timacies. The brothers pattern their relationship after an 
ideal and they would each further the advancement of the other 
toward that ideal. Finally, the soul does not, as Maeterlinck 
would say, flower only on nights of storm. The persistent per- 
sonal influence is always the strongest and best. Such per- 
sistent personal influence, in the light of high ideals, exists in 
the American college between fraternity members. It is de- 
cidedly unfair for those members to have to bear the distorted 
charges which are brought against a part, by people not cog- 
nizant of the whole, of the fraternity situation.

THE COLLEGE LITERARY SOCIETY 
Henry NELSON SNYDER 
  
[Henry Nelson Snyder (1865: ) is president of Wofford College. Before 
his election to the presidency of this institution he was professor of English 
literature. He has. written many contributions to reviews and periodicals 
on literary and educational subjects.] 
One of the significant things in college education of the last 
twenty-five years has been the comparatively steady and general 
decline in the value of the literary society. Anyone who 
entered college (say) in the early eighties, could still hear the 
reverberating echoes of superlative efforts in college oratory and 
much talk of a golden age of literary society efficiency. Even 
yet, when the older alumni of Southern institutions come to- 
gether at commencement, they sadly lament a something gone 
out of the platform exhibitions, and in reminiscent mood recall 
a time when college students “could speak,” as they say. They 
visit their old societies and, in the very act of recounting former 
glories illustrate the oratorical qualities that made the other 
years so splendid in speaking achievement. One of them, whose 
name is still one to charm with in tradition, came to me much 
out of heart and dissatisfied with the debate of the Juniors 
and the speeches of the Seniors. In a tone that implied that 
the bottom had dropped out of all things, he said: “Your 
boys write better English, discuss more up-to-date subjects than 
we used to; but they simply can’t speak.” “What do you 
mean by that?” I inquired. “Why,” continued he, “they 
don’t know how to make gestures, they don’t feel what they 
say, and they have no voices.” 
Here, then, was a student of the old school, by way of criti- 
cism of the new, asserting the aims and ideals of the literary 
society of former days, and at the same time suggesting an 
essential difference in present-day aims and ideals. Gesture, 
feeling, voice, these made the basis of the consummate product
-P-A-G-E-375
  COLLEGE ORGANIZATIONS 353 
of literary society work in the Southern College both before and 
immediately following the war. At their best, these elements 
brought a charm of stately attitudinizing, graceful action, 
moving and winning appeal to the emotions, and range and 
power of vocal expression; at their worst, affected extravagance, 
brazen and clanging rhetoric, and the sound and fury that 
signifieth nothing. This baser expression of college oratory has, 
unfrequently, I think, ruled in our conception of the general 
type of the older product of the college literary society, and 
has made it a mockery and byword. But it should be steadily 
kept in mind that the literary societies formerly aimed to de- 
velop the orator, and that the orator was the hero of the campus 
and the unfailing wonder of admiring audiences. And this 
supreme position of the orator and the fame he won were suffi- 
cient to furnish a vital atmosphere for the abounding life of that 
which produced him, the literary society. 
However, changed conditions both without and within the 
college campus have been potent enough to take the orator from 
his lofty pedestal as a college hero and furnish other social and 
scholastic ideals, which have brought about his virtual undoing, 
and hence an almost fatal enfeebling of that within which he 
moved and had his being, the literary society. Great changes 
have. come in the social ideals that appeal to young men of 
intellectual aspirations. Formerly the law and politics were the 
supreme fields that invited them, and these fields were the 
arena for the display of the power and influence of the orator. 
It should be remembered, too, that in no other part of the 
world did the mere speaker get so many glittering rewards, and 
no people were more sensitive to the charm of voice, emotional 
appeal, and graceful action than the people of the South. Every 
state, every district, every community, every crossroads and 
more than one man whom the people heard with eager gladness, 
and upon whom they were willing to confer honors and offices 
of trust for his much speaking. These outside influences 
naturally beat into the retirement of classic shades, to use an 
old-fashioned phrase, and furnished ideals potent enough to 
make the college literary society seem the most practical part of 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  354. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
the college course. Hence it flourished as the training ground of 
the rhetorical, declamatory debater and speaker, and he became 
in general estimation the consummate flower of college life. 
But a rather swift change has come in social ideals, and with it 
has grown more and more evident that the orator has had his 
day. Indeed, it does not require much insight to see that the 
orator as such has become pretty generally distrusted, and the 
demand is for plain, simple, straightforward utterance, un- 
adorned with the older graces of diction and manner. In the 
new industrial revolution and economic adjustment men have 
busied themselves with what they are pleased to call practical 
affairs, and the law and politics have not wholly monopolized 
men of talent and ambition as they once did. These conditions, 
moreover, do not call for emotion and imagination as did the 
dramatic conditions of the older days. They ask of the speaker 
if he really has anything to say—information, instruction, and 
the dry, matter-of-fact details that concern the building of 
factories and the developing of mines. They are thus of such 
nature as to create a kind of suspicion, if not contempt, for the 
man of words, however fine the words may be. 
These influences have been strongly reénforced by other 
influences within the campus, which have helped not only to 
diminish the power of the college speaker, but also to affect 
generally the place and work of the literary society. The 
first is to be found in the steady increase of academic require 
ments. More work and, I believe, a better kind of work is now 
demanded of students, so that they simply have not the timc 
they once had to give to the literary society. The result i 
that men of the finer sort devote themselves almost wholly t 
meeting scholastic requirements, and the men of the other sor\ 
either express their activity in other ways or else are not strong 
enough to make the societies at all what they should be. The 
more deeply one looks into the amount of work which each 
department requires and expects of the rather immature students 
that come to us, the more one wonders that so many manage 
to survive and in some way accomplish it. It really at times 
seems all but a slaughter of the innocents. At any rate, under 
 
-P-A-G-E-377
  COLLEGE ORGANIZATIONS 355 
the present system—and I do not say it is bad—literary society 
work must inevitably be a sort of addendum to the regular 
college course, and to give it anything like the time necessary 
to make it seem worth the doing is to rob where, if it be not a 
crime, it is at least to put in danger class standing. Men have 
neither the time nor the opportunity seriously to prepare 
themselves for their society duties. Hence it is not hard to 
understand why these societies become places for superficial 
fluency, for trivial mouthing under the name of speaking, for 
parliamentary quibbling, and cheap college politics. Such as 
this requires no preparation, and indeed may be taken as a kind 
of recreation. The faculty may make appeals, if they will, for 
a better sort of work, may point out the unusually important 
benefits of training the societies profess to offer; but with all 
departments crowding the students and devouring time, day in 
and day out, it is expecting too much of them that they should 
give such attention to the societies as that they should flourish 
with even a shadow of their former glory. These new academic 
requirements have been strong, I should say, in helping to bring 
- about the inevitable decadence of the literary society. 
But to the mere matter of requirements must also be added 
those modifications of college methods and ideals due to the 
introduction of scientific courses, with the demands of the lab- 
oratory, and the full elective courses inviting very early to 
specialization. These laboratory hours must be met. In 
laboratory hours would be included also library hours. They 
take the time that formally might have been given to prepara- 
tion for speaking and debate. But even deeper than this: 
science and its methods have subtly yet surely affected student 
ideals, and there is no class of persons more easily subdued to 
the color of certain exaggerated notions. Science and the 
scientific method applied to all subjects is a practical, everyday 
thing dealing with facts. It is thus apt to substitute in the 
student’s thinking the importance of the doer of things over the 
sayer of things, and arouse his interest in matters wholly remote 
from the subjects that usually concern the speaker and debater. 
Imagination, emotion, decorative rhetoric, high-sounding gen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-378
  350 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
eralities are just the elements that the laboratory and library 
will have none of, and yet in them the active literary society 
worker is more than apt to luxuriate. So, then, it is not only 
a question of time that we have to deal with when we come to 
consider scientific studies and the scientific method in their 
effect upon the college literary society; it is a question of aims 
and ideals as well. 
The introduction of elective courses has also had its share 
in furnishing influences unfavorable to an active interest in 
what the literary society stands for. Election leads necessarily 
to specialization, and to a narrowing, in the mind of the student, 
of what the college may mean. Now, whatever else may have 
characterized the old college, it stood for general culture; the 
new stands for special efficiency. The older type of student 
found his cultural life most active in the literary society; the 
new type of student thinks he finds his ambitions best satisfied 
in trying to know everything about a few things. The literary 
society is, therefore, apt to make only a feeble appeal to him on 
the side of general culture, even if he had time for it. If he 
thinks at all about the matter, he is likely to resist the natural 
tendency of the literary society to draw him away from his 
special line of work into broader and more general interests, 
interests that seem quite remote from what he has immediately 
in hand. There would be, for example, no inconsiderable 
number of students who would find it hard to get themselves 
concerned with the inveterate way most literary societies have 
of confining their topics of discussion almost wholly to political 
and social matters. Election, therefore, and the consequent 
narrowing of student interset and activity are influences which, 
to no small degree, limit and hamper the literary society, at 
least in comparison with what it formerly meant in college life. 
In connection with these changes and modifications in the 
college courses affecting the literary societies, I think we should 
also consider the new type of college professor. The older type 
of college teacher was, in most cases, a man of general culture, 
and was almost always, if not himself skilled and gifted in the 
art of charming public utterance, at least in full sympathy with
-P-A-G-E-379
  COLLEGE ORGANIZATIONS 357 
it, both outside and inside the literary society. Indeed, formerly 
no college faculty was wanting in one or two men who perhaps 
really owed their positions not so much to their scholarships as 
to a winning charm of stately, classic oratory. Now, however, 
we have changed all that. The mere scholar has taken the place 
of the mere teacher with the adornments of scholarship. And I 
am not sure that we have wholly gained by the change. The 
new type of professor is inclined to be cabined, cribbed, and 
confined in the narrow house of his own department. In an 
unwavering devotion to a limited field he has found that the 
rewards of his profession come. Whatever his chair, therefore, 
he is likely to be a man of deep rather than broad knowledge 
and of a hard scientific method than the graces of social and 
intellectual culture. He has not only no charm of public 
address, but is openly willing to show a contempt for the whole 
business of public speaking. Now college students are keen and 
quick to get their notions of at least some things from their 
professors, especially if these professors happen to be strong 
men. The result is that the student does not care for that in 
which his professor shows not only inefficiency, but also a 
manifest contempt. So we have here another element working 
against anything like a general and hearty appreciation of the 
value and importance of the literary society. Indeed, it is 
positively hostile to it. 
But these modifications of the college course and the new 
type of professor that has come with them have emphasized 
thorough and exact scholarship in a way hardly dreamed of 
under older conditions. We have come, therefore, to see the 
scholar, in the matter of college ideals, set high above the 
orator and debater. The plodding crammer at worst and 
brilliant student at best have taken the place, at least in the 
eye of the faculty, of the speaker who once walked, too fre- 
quently strutted, a veritable hero among his fellows. The 
truth is that the stress of college requirements, and the rewards 
that success in them bring, have so far appealed to men of talent 
that activity and a sort of efficiency in literary society work have 
been found to be characteristic of many who neglect the routine 
 
-P-A-G-E-380
       358 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
  of academic duties and demands. This has grown to be such an 
evil in some institutions that college honors have been taken from 
the hands of the literary societies in some cases, and in others a 
certain minimum of scholarship is demanded of all whom the 
societies choose to represent them on public occasions. This 
indicates a low ebb of society interest. A rather shiftless class 
of fellows are in the saddle, and institutions must protect them- 
selves by refusing a semblance of approbation,to them. But, 
however necessary this may be, such measures show in no un- 
certain way that the new conditions demand that a student 
shall be first of all a scholar and only secondarily a speaker. 
This is, of course, as it should be; still it is a sign of that low 
estate to which literary societies have fallen; and a further sign 
that the scholar is in the prime ideal of all the forces of college 
life. 
This is from the standpoint of college faculties; but the 
student community has itself, in the last twenty years, set up 
its own visions of excellency and fame-bringing achievement, 
and these have aroused such a pitch of fervent student enthu- 
siasm as none others have, not even the college orator in his 
palmiest days. The long jumper and the high kicker, the 
pitcher and the shortstop, the center rush and the quarterback 
have come to their day of radiant glory. These are the bright, 
particular stars in the college firmament, and other lights are 
lesser in comparison. The scholar and the orator both sink into 
the shadow of the commonplace in the presence of the shining 
figure of the hero of the athletic field. To him all bow, and for 
him all things exist. The outside public, through the news- 
papers, has brought college athletics into the glare and noise of 
a fierce sensationalism. I saw a rather striking notice in a 
newspaper just a little while ago. It ran this way: “A. college 
is ready for opening next week. Football Coach Smith is already 
on the grounds, and the president will be in Monday.” No 
humor was intended by this notice. It merely indicated what 
phase of the college opening the public would be especially 
interested in. The interest of the students gathers about the 
same thing with all-absorbing, all-excluding intensity, and this 
 
-P-A-G-E-381
  ” COLLEGE ORGANIZATIONS 450 
athletic interest becomes the most abiding memory after they 
leave college. Now when the younger alumni come together, it 
is not to talk of the powerful speaking of A., but of the marvel- 
ous pitching of B. and the extraordinary “run” of C. down the 
field for a touch-down. Athletics, then, is the most vital thing 
in college life under present conditions, and the athletic ideal 
looms larger before the student-mind than any other. He 
has before him. therefore, a vision of excellence other than 
intellectual and academic, as we understand that word. And 
so powerful is this influence that we may well ask what chance 
has the orator, or indeed even the scholar, in the atmosphere 
in which the athletic ideal thrives. 
There is yet another thing which we shall have to reckon with 
in dealing with the literary society as it is, especially in com- 
parison with what it has been, and that is a social matter. The 
time was when the society and its occasions represented the 
social activity of college life at its high tide. Their functions 
were the events of the year, looked forward to long before and 
talked of long after. The college shone in happy and radiant 
splendor at such times, and it seemed as if everything existed 
for, and led up to, such crowning occasions. Now, however, 
fraternity functions and the functions of other organizations 
more or less exclusive have come, if not to absorb social interest 
altogether, at least to divide it and so to dissipate it as to 
minimize the importance of the society occasions, and to reduce 
to mere formalities, to be put up with because they have been 
recurring for many years. The literary society is thus in danger 
of being shorn of its influence on even its social side. 
Now, in considering the whole question of the literary society 
in both school and college we shall have to keep before us the 
influences which we have but briefly pointed out—changed 
social ideals impatient and distrustful of the mere orator, 
increased college requirements in respect to both work and time, 
the introduction of new methods of instruction and new aims of 
work, the changed type of college professor with his example 
and attitude toward what the literary society stands for, student 
ideals of scholarship and athletics, and fresh and more varied
-P-A-G-E-382

a 
social interests. With these before us, the first question to be 
asked is: Holding to the aims and methods that once ruled the 
societies, do we desire to make the effort to restore them as they 
were? The second question is: Recognizing the literary society 
as essential, or at least a valuable part of college life, do we 
desire to keep it, but modified to suit the changed conditions? 
In answer to the first question it is my opinion that the societies 
can never be restored to the position they once held in college 
life. The conditions already discussed are simply too strong for 
that. Indeed, we can well spare the college orator or debater of 
the older type, even if it were possible to keep him alive. It is 
true that now and then when we hear him he is interesting as a 
survival of old things. But he has had his day, and a glorious 
one it was, too, while it lasted. New times, however, call for 
other things, and new conditions force the college into line. 
It is with the second question, therefore, that we have to deal; 
‘a question which affirms that the college literary society is a 
good thing and ought to be preserved and directed toward 
bringing about the results of which it is capable under present 
conditions. 
It is a wholesome sign to start with, that one can easily detect 
a reaction away from the disfavor into which the literary 
societies have fallen, in some quarters anyway, and a strong 
feeling gathering that they are really worth while. To train 
young men in simple, straightforward, natural, effective public 
speaking, to furnish a field for the practice of the rules govern- 
ing deliberative bodies, to offer opportunity for a more or less 
extemporaneous discussion of current matters of sociology, 
politics, commerce, literature, and science, however crude the 
discussion may be, may lead to acquirements not to be despised 
in the preparation of men who are to take their places as citizens 
in a democracy like ours. Indeed, all will agree that it is 
absolutely indispensable that at least a few shall be so trained. 
If the college is to inform men in the larger matters of human 
interest, give the right perspective fo their judgments, and train 
them to think clearly and sanely, it ought also to do all it can to 
get these things properly expressed in both written and spoken 
 
-P-A-G-E-383
       COLL: GE ORGANIZATIONS 361 
utterance. Even the trained thinker and the man of wide and 
sure knowledge may be so far hampered in the mere matter of 
expression as to bungle his thinking and darken his knowledge. 
It is highly important, therefore, that we should cultivate 
and foster whatever tends to make reasoned thought and en- 
lightened knowledge effective in the free air of a democracy in 
which there are so many voices that deafen the reason and 
eclipse the light. This is the utilitarian view of the possible use 
of the literary society, and leaves out of all consideration those 
mere graces of public speech that used to make them things 
greatly desired for the delight they gave. 
But apart from this outlook into that practical life for which 
the college professes to be getting men ready, we should further 
see, in considering the mission and use of the literary society, 
the need of some one element that will unify, if possible, on an 
intellectual and strictly academic basis all the varied and mani- 
fold interests of college life. Now I should not underrate or 
belittle the very important use of football and baseball clubs in 
fusing the scattered interests of a college campus into one over- 
whelming sentiment that we describe in the rather indefinite 
phrase “college spirit.” This is more than a mere sentimen- 
tality that finds expression in hideous yells and gives hoarse, 
husky answers in the class room after all games. Poor indeed is 
that college that has not this spirit, and I am almost willing to 
shut my eyes to the excesses of the noisy strenuosity of the 
athletic mood if it bring into the campus life a warm, vital sense 
of college unity and bind all the men together in a close bond of 
student fellowship. It is certain, too, that no other single 
influence can be quite so strong as athletics to bring this about, 
at least so long as college students are what they are. But I 
should earnestly desire to add to the unifying forces of the 
community life other interests which, if they be of a milder sort, 
are yet intellectual and academic. The collége rests, as com- 
lmonplace as it is to say it, fundamentally on things of the mind, 
land brawn should not absorb the enthusiasm of the students to 
he exclusion of brain. Now in the possibilities of the literary 
ocieties one can see the only means whereby a strong sense of 
     
    
     
                    
     
  
-P-A-G-E-384
      
COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
    362 
student unity may be established on a basis of intellectual effort 
and excellence. 
The first step in this direction is to be taken in the effort 
to arouse and maintain a vital interest in these societies. We 
certainly must get over any cold and languid attitude toward 
them, and insist that they are not merely for the limited few 
who happen to have a taste for that sort of work just as there 
are those who have special aptitudes for chemistry or history or 
mathematics, but are for all students. If the notion is to become 
current that the literary society is to be for a small group of 
men with special aptitudes and uncommon skill in speaking of 
debate, we shall greatly narrow its aim and use. If it is to be 
no more than this, it is hardly worth the effort to keep it alive. 
Under such a conception it either languishes or else it becomes 
a limited literary club, in which a few chosen spirits may air 
their notions of things in general, and exploit themselves in 
public positions which have long since lost the distinction 
attaching to them. To arouse a general interest rests largely 
with the authorities of an institution. It is possible for a 
college faculty both collectively and individually so to express 
themselves with reference to their attitude to, and their esti- 
mate of, the value of society work as to awaken student appre- 
ciation and activity. One thing is certain, however; anything 
like a feeble support on the part of the authorities of an insti- 
tution is, under present conditions, bound to react to the detri- 
ment of the societies. 
But we should go even farther than giving a hearty general 
approbation to what the societies stand for and encouraging to 
the full, in a general way, what they are trying todo. It is my 
judgment that all students should be required to join one of the 
literary societies at least during one year of their college course. 
‘This at first may seem a hardship and a placing of undue 
emphasis upon their importance in college life. But when we 
consider both their absolute value and their possible social use 
in unifying the college community upon an intellectual basis, I 
believe it worth doing. To do this, moreover, is at once to show 
in a tangible way the high value set upon literary society work. 
    
     
                           
-P-A-G-E-385
  COLLEGE ORGANIZATIONS 363, 
A student may elect this or that course of study, but he must 
elect the work of the seciety. Moreover, in this way, as I have 
already said, the entire student body may possibly be bound 
together in academic fellowship, and all departments meet upon 
a common ground. A unifying process, a thing greatly to be 
desired under present collegiate conditions, when the student 
community is broken into small groups, is thus going on. 
Whether or not we thus commit the entire student body to 
membership in the literary societies, they are such important 
interests that there should be regular and frequent visitation on 
the part of the faculties. In this way, by suggestive addresses 
not only upon the special concerns of literary society work, but 
also upon general subjects of larger public interest, members of 
the faculty would be recognizing the students in their collective 
society relationships, and would be thus committing themselves 
to a share in those things the students are trying to do through 
the societies. But the faculty should do more than this. There 
ought to be in every college a standing faculty committee whose 
duty it should be to keep itself close to the societies, and without 
needless interference help in directing them to the best results 
and shaping their aims in accordance with the best ideals. It 
is little short of suicidal to leave so important an interest wholly 
to the management of rather immature young men. It is no 
wonder that at times they bungle the whole matter and bring 
the societies to such ignoble uses that we are willing to abolish 
them out and out as a waste of time and a mangling and perver- 
sion of opportunities. 
If cheap political methods, drawn from practical politics with 
which young men in the South are all too familiar; if noisy 
mouthing and empty vaporizing under the name of speech- 
making; the absence of earnest, intelligent effort and serious 
preparation; the facile, fluent readiness to handle grave, im- 
portant questions with a superficial flippancy, quibbling with 
fact and principle that train the dodger and the shallow causist 
—if these things all too frequently mark literary society work 
we have to blame, to no small degree, the let-alone policy of 
college faculties. We have been rather prone to believe that 
 
-P-A-G-E-386
364. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
the day of the literary society was past and that its real useful- 
ness was at an end; that it was an ancient survival of an old 
formality clinging with some other old things to college life. 
We have been so busy reconstructing courses of study and 
readjusting methods of instruction that we have, perhaps, 
neglected one other important interest that needed reconstruc- 
tion and a fresh adaption to meet changed conditions. This 
faculty committee, therefore, has a work to do in getting 
literary societies to a point where they can do the things of 
which they are really capable. And this work is worth doing; 
it lies along the line of general and special consultation, choice 
of themes, literary references, advice, suggestion, and direction 
in all that concerns literary society efficiency. 
I believe, too, that each member of the faculty can also take 
his share in making the literary society seem worth while in 
yet another way. Each should see to it that at least now and 
then his department is in some way represented upon the floor 
of the society. Under present conditions, due to election and 
divided courses of study, it is possible for no inconsiderable body 
of students to know absolutely nothing of special departments 
outside the range of their own line of study. To this class of 
students the college is really narrowed to the small field in which 
they may be engaged. To offset this, it is possible for each 
professor to choose a capable.man, and direct him to the treat- 
ment of certain phases of his own department susceptible to 
popular appeal. He would not only thus be opening his own 
specialty to the student body (in a small, imperfect way, to be| 
sure), but he would also be helping to broaden their view of th 
larger work the college is trying to do. His service would, 
therefore, to be a twofold one, while at the same time he woul 
be emphasizing his own interest in the work of the society. 
In particular, the English department should be closely relate 
to the work of the literary society. No course in English shoul 
be considered complete without offering special work in writte 
speeches and debate, and reference should always be had to th 
practical application of the work to the purposes and needs of th 
societies. In this way the character of the speaking, writin

and debating could possibly be shaped in accordance with the 
best ideals, and relieved of the futile, inane, vicious rhetoric that 
characterizes so much the so-called “efforts” of college students. 
I believe, too, it would be possible for “credit” to be allowed by 
a department for work done in the societies under its direction 
and approval. Thus due and proper emphasis could be laid 
upon the importance of the work a student does for his society, 
and a higher quality of achievement could be reached. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. Draw a contrast between the college literary society of the 
past and that of the present, with especial reference to your own 
college, indicating the causes of the change. 2. Discuss the condition 
of the literary societies at your institution. If they are not flourish- 
ing as they should, point out what seems to be the special cause of 
their decline in influence. 3. Show the benefits to be derived from 
joining a literary society. 4. Give your opinion as to whether | 
college credit should be given for literary society work. 5. Dis- 
cuss the suggestion in this article that every student should be 
required to join a literary society for at least one year of his college 
course (page 362). What effect would this requirement tend to have 
on the societies?

Wr1tAM Raney HARPER 
[William Rainey Harper (1856-1906) was at the time of his death president 
of the University of Chicago. As the first president of that institution, he 
manifested great initiative and aggressiveness, and rapidly put it among 
the leading American universities. Dr. Harper was also distinguished as a 
teacher and student of Hebrew. This address was delivered on the occasion 
of the inauguration of Professor Rush Rhees as president of Rochester 
University, October, 1900.] 
The growth of interest shown in the field of higher education 
during thirty years or so has been as marked as the growth of 
the industrial world. The changes which have come about in 
connection with this growth, and in part a consequence of it, 
are greater than can be appreciated without a careful com- 
parison, point by point, between the usage of to-day and that of 
a quarter-century ago. A multitude of agencies, all of which 
relate themselves to the thought of democracy, and which owe 
their life to the spirit of democracy, have exerted influence upon 
the minutest details of higher educational life and method. 
The changes, therefore, in the educational field are due to the 
same causes, and indeed are the same changes as those which 
have taken place in every kind of life about us. 
Thirty years ago there were no universities nor large institu- 
1 Reprinted from The Trend in Higher Education (University of Chicago Press) by per- 
mission.

tions. Harvard had 655 students; Yale, 664; Michigan, 432. 
The American university is something entirely new; and side 
by side with its development, important modifications in the 
method and aim of college work have come in. No one questions 
for a single moment the fact that these changes have in general 
served to advance the cause of education; and yet one will be 
* slow to make the distinct announcement that in every detail 
these changes have proved to be a source of added strength. 
What I have in mind to speak of to-day, however, is the actual 
relationship which exists, or should exist, between the college 
student in his student life and the college professor. I use the 
word “college” rather than the word “university.” In real 
university life the question of this relationship is one which 
has not yet received even the slightest consideration. I am 
myself persuaded that in the university as well as in the college 
the members of the faculty have large and definite responsibili- 
ties outside of those pertaining directly to the work of the lecture- 
room; but the opportunity this afternoon permits but few words 
at best, and these I shall restrict to the college life as distin- 
guished from that of the university. 
The college professor of to-day is not an officer of the state, 
but a fellow-student. The truth is he is not an officer at all, 
although, in view of the old traditions or with a new meaning 
for the word, the term may be employed. The higher institu- 
tion of learning is not, as it once was, an institution empowered 
to try its students for civil or criminal offenses. University 
courts are a reminiscence of the Middle Ages. The college 
professor is neither a judge nor a member of a jury. He is not 
set to pass judgment on the conduct of the student, if that con- 
duct should violate the state laws. The college community is 
one made up of older and younger students, all of whom have 
joined the community in order to make progress in intellectual 
life. If some of the members of the community for good reason 
violate its common sentiment, they should retire, and naturally 
it will be the older members of the community who, as fellow- 
students, will have the most to do with determining the par- 
ticular spirit that shall be characteristic of the community. 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
368 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
In that incitement which those more advanced in the same kinds 
of work may furnish to those who follow, in the sympathy which 
binds together those who hold interests in common, in the 
ambition which leads a student to emulate and to out-distance 
fellow-students—in all these and in other ways the college 
professor will show himself as much a student as any other in, 
the college; as intense a worker, as sympathetic a listener, as 
humble a learner as any member of the community. The only 
difference between the professor and the pupil is that the former 
has the advantage of maturity and experience. This advantage 
he shares unselfishly with his fellow-student, the pupil. May- 
be the pupil is just beginning his work along these higher lines, 
while the professor has learned long since that, whatever prog- 
ress he may have made, he is still only on the border lines of 
knowledge in his department. The college professor who has 
not the student spirit should not continue his college work, 
and, if he have the student spirit, then he is a fellow-student with 
all who have that spirit. The idea involved in arbitrary exer- 
cise of authority as an officer is utterly opposed to the student 
spirit. It is an attitude of mind with which the student spirit 
is entirely inconsistent; and so to-day, the true and efficient 
college instructor is only an older fellow-student in a guild 
made up of members all of whom, if they so deserve, retain 
their membership—are truly fellow-students. | If he is more than 
this, he is not this; if he is less than this, he is nothing. 
The college professor to-day is not an officer in loco parentis 
It is an old and widely prevailing opinion which in oppositioi 
to this statement would make the college instructor parent fot 
the time being of those with whom he is to associate. This idea 
is, of course, closely related to that which has just been men 
tioned. Parents who have occupied the first sixteen or eighteen 
years of the life of the prospective pupil in such a manner as ta 
convince the pupil that parental discipline is something to be 
dreaded and to be avoided, something mischievous and pro 
ductive of every evil, are only too glad to turn their sons and 
daughters over to the college, with the understanding that the 
college shall now assume parental authority. Such parents, in
-P-A-G-E-391
: COLLEGE GOVERNMENT 369 
transferring this dignified and far-reaching function, have 
transferred, in these cases, something that has long since been 
emptied of its dignity and its worth. If parental authority has 
been rightly exercised, the young man or the young woman at 
the age of eighteen ought to be free, within the limitations of 
conventional life, to do what seems proper, in so far as it does 
not conflict with the general sentiment of the particular com- 
munity to which they have now given adherence. If the par- 
ental authority has not been exercised properly during those 
eighteen years, the young man or young woman will not be 
found ready to submit to artificial authority of an institutional 
character even for a moment. 
No, the college instructor is not a parent, nor does he have the 
authority of a parent. Parents in these days are themselves 
wise enough to know that at the college age the time has come 
when the young man or the young woman will not brook 
objective or institutional authority. The influence of the 
parent has its basis in affection; and the professor, if he would 
exert a strong influence, must convince the student that he is 
serving the student’s interests. The instructor is, therefore, 
an older brother in the student’s family. Here again the ad- 
vantage is only that which comes from age and experience. 
As in any given family there are those who stand more closely 
associated—brothers, for instance, in some cases stand in closer, 
in others a less close relationship—so the ideal community is a 
fraternity in which older and younger come together and in- 
fluence each other in a different degree. 
For my own part, I can conceive that the influence of the 
younger members of this fraternity is as great in many instances 
upon the older as is that of the older men upon the young. 
This influence will be very strong, and will be entirely different 
from any arbitrary exercise of authority. For the college com- 
munity is a real democracy. All men, even in a democracy, 
are not equal although all deserve equal privileges. In the 
college community these have larger influence, who, by reason 
of age and wisdom and training, have larger opportunity to aid 
those who as yet have not attained to the same high level,
-P-A-G-E-392
    
370 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
If the foregoing conceptions are in any measure correct, it 
follows that the closeness of the relationship which we are con- 
sidering will depend upon the extent to which in any given case 
the pupil and the instructor have common interests; and those 
who have common interests, whether of an objective or a 
subjective character, will alone derive strong advantage from 
this relationship. It is just here that the principle of election 
plays its part. The opportunity to elect certain subjects for 
study is one which permits the pupil to assume the relation of 
fellowship with an instructor whose highest interests connect 
themselves with those subjects. A pupil cannot be a fellow- 
student with a professor, if pupil and professor do not have a 
fellow-feeling toward the subject studied. On the other hand, 
fellowship and friendship can hardly be avoided in the case of 
pupil and instructor whose hearts are drawn in the same direc- 
tion, whose minds are led to deal continuously with the same 
thought, and whose lives are thus brought intimately together. 
Fellow studentship between instructor and pupil is therefore 
dependent upon the opportunity to elect; and if it has existed 
in earlier times without this opportunity, it has been, in many 
cases, an accident. 
The principle of election, then, has made student-fellowship 
between officer and pupil possible; nay, more, it has made any 
other relationship impossible. But this, it may be said, does 
not apply to those subjects in the first year of college work 
which all students take in common; for example, Latin, English, 
mathematics. Here an important difference exists between 
the larger and the smaller college. In the latter the old régime 
still continues. The freshman and the sophomore do not think 
of student-fellowship with instructors. It is only when one 
has come to be a junior or a senior that he may, under ordinary 
circumstances, be said to enter into any kind of relationship 
with his instructors; and this is because in most instances in the 
smaller institutions all students must go to one man for work 
in Latin, to another for work in English, and to another for 
work in mathematics. Even though there be two or three, the 
student has no choice; because, there being but a single class
-P-A-G-E-393
  
COLLEGE GOVERNMENT 37i 
of a certain stage of advancement, some one instructor of the 
department takes the more advanced students, another those 
less advanced; and this arrangement leaves the student him- 
self no choice. In the larger institutions it is possible—although 
it must be admitted the possibility is not often realized—to 
apply the principle of election to the instructor rather than to 
the subject of instruction. And here a new principle comes 
into operation. The pupil may select one or two or three, or 
even more, instructors who are offering the same course of 
instruction at the same time. 
There is, indeed, much to be said in favor of the distribution 
of students in sections made up of those of equal intellectual 
strength, Section A including those who rank highest, the other 
sections also being organized on the basis of scholarship. There 
are advantages in this system; but there are advantages also 
in the system which will allow each student to select that one 
of the two or more instructors offering the same subject at the 
same time who shall seem to be a man between whom and the 
pupil a close personal relationship may exist. One instructor 
may prove to be sympathetic and helpful to pupils of a certain 
temperament and attitude of mind. This same instructor may 
utterly fail to be of assistance to another group of students 
equally strong; while a second instructor may succeed with the 
second group and fail with the first. Few men occupy the 
professorial chair in our colleges who can touch closely even a 
majority of the students in their classes. This is in many cases, 
as has been said, a matter of natural temperament. The 
nervous and vigorous instructor will accomplish most for 
students of one temperament, while students of another tem- 
perament will receive injury from his instruction. The sober, 
quiet, and unobtrusive personality of another instructor will, 
on the other hand, find response in the minds and hearts of 
students whom the first instructor could not touch. 
From this point of view care should be taken that the in- 
structors in a given department of study should be men or women 
of entirely different types, in order that, being thus different, 
they may bring themselves into relationship with different types
-P-A-G-E-394
372, COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
of pupils. In the liberty accorded the pupil to select the de- 
partments in which he will study, and in the liberty which 
he may enjoy to make choice between different instructors 
offering the same grade of work at the same time, there will be 
found the basis, and the only basis, for fellow-studentship and 
for fraternal comradeship; and these together constitute the 
ideal relationship that should exist between the instructor and 
his pupil. 
Iregret that the limit of time has not permitted me to enlarge 
upon the thought I have in mind. But now, in bearing greetings 
from the university which I have the honor to represent to our 
colleague’ who to-day assumes the responsibilities of this high 
office, it will not be inappropriate to make brief application 
of these propositions to him and to his office. 
If the college instructor be a student, if he be a fellow-student, 
one of the members of a community of students, the president 
of the college must in a peculiar sense be such a student. There 
is no place in the college community for a man, whether he be 
pupil or instructor or president, who is not a student, who is 
not himself engaged in the search for truth, or for the best 
methods of propagating truth already known. I do not mean 
that he must be a formal teacher; for this there may not be 
good opportunity. But the college community cannot have as 
its most honored member one who is not a student in one or 
another of the great departments of life—one who has not the 
student mind, the student attitude of mind, the student sym- 
pathy, or the student ambition. , 
If the college community is a family of brothers, in which the 
instructor is an older member guiding as best he can those 
who have more recently entered the family, it follows that the 
president is the elder brother, the oldest of the family, that one 
in whom special responsibilities rest—responsibilities which shall 
be discharged only as they conserve the interests of the family, 
as they include the work and the growth of even the youngest 
member of the family. The relationship between him and the 
. instructor is that of brothers closely related in age. His re- 
lationship to the pupils is that of a brother somewhat separated, 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
  
COLLEGE GOVERNMENT 373 
perhaps, in years, but, for that very reason, in whose heart 
there will be found greater care and tenderness for those who are 
the newcomers in the family. The president will be the most 
honored student of the student community. He is the oldest 
brother of the family, and as such his interests will be broader 
than those of any other student. Personally he may have made 
choice of some special subject, but officially he will feel the same 
interest in every department, and will labor with his fellow-stu- 
dents who represent the departments, for their upbuilding. 
Breadth of interest will be his strongest characteristic. As a 
member and a brother in the family, he will exercise the largest 
sympathy with the other members of the family, old and young. 
His personal relationship will be close; with each brother of the 
family who has occasion to rejoice he will rejoice; with each 
member of the family who has occasion to weep he will weep. 
As a true brother he will point out to each member of the 
family, young and old, what in his opinion is wrong; and he will 
make effort to suggest how improvement may be secured. He 
will exercise, if need be, that candor and that straightforward 
bluntness which a brother may exercise toward a brother. 
His attitude will not be that of a superior person endowed for 
the time being with superior power. The true college president 
is not a “boss”; he is a fellow-student and a brother.   TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING

    374. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
COLLEGE DISCIPLINE! 
Tuomas ARKLE CLARK 
[Thomas Arkle Clark (1862 ) is dean of men in the University of 
Illinois. Before taking up the work of this position he was professor of 
thetoric in the same institution for many years. As dean, he has shown 
himself one of those rare men in this office who by tact and sympathy with 
the student’s point of view can exercise a powerful influence upon the char- 
acters of the young men of a large university. This selection was originally 
a paper presented before the Department of Higher Education of the 
National Educational Association at its meeting in July, r910.]   
The greatest handicap in my experience to successful college 
discipline is the excessive number of rules laid down by the 
colleges for the conduct of students. Too many college officers 
feel that when an evil exists, or an erroneous custom prevails, 
the only thing necessary is to pass a regulation against the evil, 
or the custom, and the matter is settled. The real fact is that 
generally the more rules an institution has, the more difficulty 
the college officers find in maintaining good discipline, and 
in keeping the young people within bounds. 
It is safe to take for granted that young people of college age 
know in the main what is right and what is reasonable as to 
conduct, so that it is not necessary that every sin in the decalogue, 
or that every violation of the law under the statute, should 
be named in the college catalogue and the penalty for its viola- 
tion attached. Rules often prevent individual action in 
specific cases. Every violation of good order should be taken 
up, looked into, and judged as if it were the only one of its sort. 
Rules often hamper such judgment. Many college rules are 
virtually a dead letter because they are difficult or impossible 
of execution, and the existence of such regulations can do nothing 
less than bring the whole system of college statutes into ridicule 
and disrepute. I believe, for illustration, that it would be a 
most excellent thing if college students did not visit saloons, 
1A paper read before the Department of Higher Education of the National Educational 
Association, toro. Reprinted from the Proceedings by permission of the author.

for I have known very few students who were not to a greater 
or less degree injured by such a practice. It seems to me, how- 
ever, usually worse than useless, and in fact often harmful, for 
a college to make a rule prohibiting students from entering 
saloons, because it is so evidently a rule unlikely or impossible 
to be enforced. 
More than this, the very existence of regulations will fre- 
quently incite students to insubordination that would not 
otherwise have been thought of. “I’ve just discovered,” one 
freshman said to another, “that it’s against the rules to smoke in 
the quadrangle. Now, I suppose it will make me sick, for I 
don’t care much for smoking, but I couldn’t let a thing like that 
go by without having a try at it.” I am not arguing against 
regulations per se; some of course are necessary for the proper 
conduct of any business or institution, but the fewer the better, 
and then only those which are absolutely necessary. 
The young person who enters college is on a different basis, 
and should receive different treatment, from the same person 
in the high school. He is more nearly an adult, and he should 
be treated as such. He is more independent, more upon his own 
responsibility, and so far as possible he should be left to manage 
his own conduct and his own affairs. The more he can be let 
“alone the better. This last statement does not mean in any sense 
that no one should know what he is doing.. Much of the trouble 
that occurs in college—nearly all that occurred in my own under- 
graduate days—comes from the fact that rules more or less 
arbitrary and often foolish are made in the belief that such 
legislation will in itself correct any tendency to wander which 
the undergraduate may evince. Seldom is any effort made to 
keep an eye upon the young student, and to forestall any 
dereliction into which he may fall. The best way to manage 
the student guilty of misconduct is to look after him so personally 
and so carefully that he may be brought to account just before 
he has been guilty of the act that would subject him to discipline. 
This last statement may geem like a paradox, or an Irish bull, 
but I am sure that the most skillful disciplinary work which I 
have ever done in the ten years during which I have been a 
 
-P-A-G-E-398
  376 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
disciplinary officer has been connected with the things that 
never happened, because they were not allowed to. 
Granted that the college has made few rules, and that there 
is some one who keeps himself pretty thoroughly conversant 
with what is going on, there will still be infractions of regula- 
tions, and the necessity on the part of college officers to exercise 
authority. Youth is still young and irresponsible, and is quite 
as likely to be guided by impulse as by judgment. In my own 
undergraduate days, twenty years ago, when a young fellow 
had been drunk, had danced in a college hall, had carried away 
the campus fence to add fuel to the bonfire in celebration of 
Hallowe’en, or had backed the cannon into the sluggish stream 
that flowed through the campus in order to show his disapproval 
of compulsory military drill—when he had done any of these 
things and was caught, he was brought before the entire faculty 
assembled in most serious session, and here he was tried. It is 
a harrowing experience, as some of us well know, and one not 
likely always to bring justice. A man may perhaps make a good 
teacher, or a good scientific investigator, without making a 
good judge. When an entire faculty deliberates on disciplinary 
matters there is likely to be too much talking, some wrangling, 
and uncertain conclusions. The responsibility is too widely 
scattered, and the student and good order are sure to suffer. 
Disciplinary matters will be handled more satisfactorily to all 
concerned if put in charge of a small body composed of from 
three to five persons chosen because of their knowledge of student 
life and conditions, and because of their special fitness to give 
reasonable and sympathetic judgments on the cases that come 
before them. The members of such a committee should, be 
young, or should have once been young, with the memory of 
that time still in mind. They should be broad-minded and 
above petty prejudices. They should still be interested in the 
things outside of books that interest normal, healthy young 
people—such as athletic sports and social pleasures. They 
should have backbone enough when an unpleasant thing has to 
be done, and ought to be done, to do it even though it hurts 
some students, and some fathers and mothers. Ordinarily I
-P-A-G-E-399
  
COLLEGE GOVERNMENT 397 
should not consider it a calamity if neither women nor lawyers 
were on such a committee. Women are more often than men 
influenced by their prejudices or their emotions, and lawyers are 
likely to insist upon a “legal” conviction. Conditions are such 
that a man should often be allowed to go free who has really 
violated a college regulation, while another man who cannot be 
proved guilty of any actual dereliction may yet clearly be 
proved a detriment to the community, and should be sent away. 
Tn institutions where both men and women are in attendance 
I believe it will often be found of advantage for a different com- 
mittee to pass upon the cases of discipline of women from the 
one which considers the cases of men. Men and women are so 
different, especially young men and young women, in the crises 
which matters of discipline bring, that I believe they may very 
well be handled by people of somewhat different temperaments. 
Men, for instance, I have found will almost always tell the 
truth about their own escapades, being careful, of course, not 
to bring in any of their companions, but shielding themselves 
very little; while girls, under similar conditions, from sheer 
nervousness or terror, will often tell the most palpable untruths. 
Whether or not such a committee should be given absolute 
and final power, or should report its findings to the faculty, 
or to some higher power for confirmation and final action, will 
depend upon local conditions. Whichever method is employed 
the findings of such a committee should virtually be final, or its 
power and influence will count for very little. 
In such a disciplinary committee as I have discussed the 
general management should be in the hands of a chairman 
who should be a man of experience and judgment, well ac- 
quainted with students and student activities, and he should 
allow only such matters to come before the committee for 
trial as cannot be settled in some more amicable and satis- 
factory way. Cases requiring discipline may be reported to 
him either directly or through the proper college officer. 
A disciplinary officer to be successful must have the confidence 
of both students and faculty. The faculty must feel that 
matters given into his hands will be dealt with squarely, and
-P-A-G-E-400
  378 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
without delay. No college instructor wishes to be humiliated 
by having matters of discipline which he reports either ignored 
or treated lightly. Neither should he feel that he is compro- 
mised if every student whom he reports for discipline is not found 
guilty. I have known college instructors who refused to report 
cases of alleged cribbing, because of the fact that a student 
previously reported had not been found guilty by the disciplinary 
committee. It was not justice they desired, but conviction. 
Many instructors are annoyed by what they consider unneces- 
sary delay in disciplinary affairs. They do not realize that it 
takes time to assemble committees, to gather facts, and to come 
to conclusions which will do justice to everyone concerned. 
No disciplinary officer will get on well unless he has a reputa- 
tion for playing fair. If the college officer is willing to give the 
square deal, he will have gone a long way toward solving his 
official difficulties. He will sometimes have to listen to some 
long stories, he will perhaps have often to go a long way and 
suffer some inconvenience to discover necessary facts, but the 
college students whom I have known have for the most part 
been square, and have been willing to take without complaint 
or whimpering what was legitimately coming to them for their 
misdeeds, when it was shown to them that the college officer 
was inclined to do the fair thing. 
I long ago learned that it will never do to reach a conclusion 
with regard to any matter under dispute without hearing both 
sides of the story. No matter how damaging or convincing 
the evidence may be, it is always best to hold one’s judgment 
in abeyance until the accused party has been heard, and given a 
fair chance to defend himself. 
Only a few days ago a woman called me up to settle a dispute 
with reference to an alleged agreement which she had had with 
a student. “Should not a student who has rented a room for 
a semester, and who leaves before that time, pay for the whole 
semester?” she asked. “Ordinarily, yes,” I answered, “but I 
should like to talk to the student before answering.” And when 
I did, I found that in reality the woman had violated her con- 
tract, but wanted still to hold the student to his.
-P-A-G-E-401
   COLLEGE GOVERNMENT 379 
It is never advisable to convict a man on circumstantial 
evidence, no matter how convincing it may appear to be. The 
committee of which I am chairman in my own institution have 
made it a rule to give the student the benefit of the doubt unless 
the case is clearly proved. We have never felt that we have 
lost by this method, for even though some guilty ones have 
escaped we have always been able to justify our actions, and to 
hold to our decisions. 
This last point is a really important one. Whenever a dis- 
ciplinary body gets a reputation for reversing its decisions, or 
changing its action at the first appeal, it loses force and influence. 
It is no light matter to send a man away from college; it may 
deprive the student of his chances of an education, and it is a 
disgrace and a sorrow to the family at home not easily borne. 
For that reason, such action should be taken deliberately, with 
a clear notion of what the facts are, and what the punishment 
means. Being once taken, unless new evidence is presented 
which alters the circumstances and presents new conditions, it 
should not be reversed. Any college disciplinary body will have 
to withstand tears and promises of reform, petitions and the 
onslaught of influential friends. If the decision was right, 
however, it should stand; if it was wrong, it should never have 
been made. 
Whenever a disciplinary officer shows unusual consideration 
for the position or the connections of anyone under examination, 
he loses his grasp of the situation. A student should not be 
shown favors because he is some one’s son, or because he is 
related to some one who has social position or influence. Every- 
one should be treated alike so far as his social position is con- 
cerned. 
Personally I have found the greatest help in the solving of 
disciplinary difficulties in the students themselves. I should 
have far more trouble than I do were it not for the reliance which 
I have upon individual students, and student organizations, 
to help control situations. One of the main reasons why I have 
‘favored fraternities, and other social organizations among 
students, is because I have found them of the greatest help to 
     
   
   
                             
-P-A-G-E-402
   
  380 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
  me in controlling and directing student activities, and in pre- 
venting dissipations and outbursts which might otherwise occur. 
One active student leader can help immensely to keep things 
under control. 
One of the greatest difficulties of student discipline lies in the 
changing character of the student population. Every year, 
perhaps one third of the student community is new, and must 
become accustomed to the traditions and the regulations of 
the college. Whether this number consists of one hundred or 
one thousand, it should be some one’s business to get acquainted 
with these freshmen, to know so far as possible who they are, 
where they come from, where they live, and what they are 
doing. If students have the feeling that some college officer 
knows what they are doing, and if the college officer goes far 
to make this feeling a reality, the problems of student discipline 
will be minimized. We are coming more and more to see, I 
believe, that though college students should be allowed so far 
as possible to think and act independently, they should be so 
situated that some one will know what they are doing; then, if 
trouble is brewing, some one will know where to look for it, and 
perhaps how to prevent it; if not, he will at least have a more 
intelligent idea of how it may be ended with the least friction 
on student and faculty. 
If a man hopes to succeed as a disciplinary officer he must 
keep closely in touch and sympathy with student life and stu- 
dent activities. He must be willing to praise the virtuous, to 
commend the worthy as well as to pass judgment upon the 
derelict. The wider his acquaintance the better; the more 
fully he understands human nature the easier will be his task. 
He must often know a great many things which he does not 
tell, though he must not tell things which he does not know. 
He will not lose if he sometimes does the unexpected thing, 
and no matter how many years he may live he must always 
be young.

ErHELBERT DuDLEY WARFIELD 
  
[Ethelbert Dudley Warfield (1861 ) was from 1891-1914 president of 
Lafayette College. Before becoming president of this institution, he was 
at the head of Miami University for several years.] 
Of all the problems which colleges have had to deal with, 
the most difficult have had to do with college life, not with col- 
lege learning. The practical genius of the Anglo-Saxon people 
at the very dawn of their conscious life demanded that the 
learning of the school and the college should be a lamp to the feet 
of men. The learning of the cloister was well enough, but it 
was not the only, nor even the most important thing. It has 
been the pride of English schools and colleges that they have 
trained not merely scholars, but statesmen; that they have 
developed not merely men of letters, but men of affairs; that

they have directed the progress of thought not more than the 
growth of colonies and the rule of kings. The college has 
existed for the state, it has sought to influence the standards 
of life within the state, it has realized that its graduates were 
to be not merely scholars, but citizens. 
While it has sought to do this for the state, and has done it 
with conspicuous success, the college has found it difficult to 
assimilate the raw material constantly sent to its mills, and 
has at times failed in the practical management of its own 
temporary citizens—crude emigrants from many and often hos- 
tile homes, who have not yet reached the full standard of 
naturalization. During the Middle Ages so miscellaneous was 
the collection of students in all the great universities, and so 
rude were the best elements among them, that the difficulty of 
governing them became immense, and yet there was a thor- 
oughgoing system, capable of the exertion of great repressive 
power, always in operation. Down to the Renaissance there 
were practically no students in the universities who were not in 
greater or less degree members of the clerical body. In one 
form or other they were under the domination, direct and per- 
sonal, of “Mother Church,” and their teachers were in every 
case their spiritual superiors. With the temporal power of 
penance, and the spiritual terrors of excommunication, in addi- 
tion to the rules of various monastic orders, supported by the 
institution of the confessional, it would seem as though there 
existed a ready-made system of government adequate to all 
needs. But men are men, and human nature is the same in all 
ages. Youth is a period of vivacity and vitality. And under 
the conditions of life prevalent in the Middle Ages, rough and 
boisterous conduct, indulgence, and excess were not only 
natural, but were hardly deemed scandalous. The traditional 
warfare of town and gown not merely raged periodically, but 
the students were sure to take sides in the oft-recurring con- 
flict between the organized forces of a powerful and centralized 
church to which they owed spiritual allegiance, and the too 
often disorganized impotence of a feudalized monarchy to 
whom they owed temporal allegiance. The result was not

merely disorder, but open conflict, leading to secessions of the 
universities from towns where they believed themselves to 
have been oppressed and mistreated. Thus Bologna migrated 
to Verona, Paris to Oxford, Oxford to Stamford, under the 
hard compulsion of a pitiless feudalism in conflict with a riot- 
ous student body. A brief extract from the chronicles of the 
reign of Henry III, translated from Walter Map, will give a 
striking picture of student life in the thirteenth century. “At 
that time the lord legate went to Oxford. The scholar clerks 
sent him an honorable present in the shape of meat and drink, 
before breakfast. After breakfast they went to his lodging to 
call and pay their respects. On their arrival an Italian porter 
with improper and untimely jesting, opened the gate a little 
and bawled out after the Roman manner, ‘What do ye want?’ 
whereto the clerks replied, ‘To pay our respect to the lord 
legate.’ For they felt sure that they would receive honor in 
return for honor. But the porter replied with taunts, and in 
wanton pride and abuse refused them all admittance. On 
seeing this the clerks made a rush and got in; the Romans 
wishing to keep them back struck them with their fists and 
sticks; while the contending parties were bandying blows and 
abuse, a poor Irish chaplain, who was standing at the kitchen 
door, happened to earnestly beg for something in God’s name, as 
poor and hungry men will do. The master of the legate’s 
cooks heard him, but paid no heed, and being annoyed with the 
poor man, threw in his face some hot water from the caldron 
in which rich meat was being cooked. At this wrong a clerk 
from the Welsh border cried out ‘Shame! that we should put 
up with this,’ and drawing a bow which he carried—for as the 
tumult increased some of the clerks had snatched up arms that 
came to their hands—he discharged an arrow which pierced 
the cook, whom the clerks satirically called ‘Nabuzaradan,’ 
which means Chief of the Cooks. When he fell dead, an 
uproar arose, at which the legate, overcome with amazement 
and excessive fright, which may befall even the most stead- 
fast, took refuge in the church tower, having on his canonical 
hood, and had the doors closed behind him. When the approach

of darkness had put an end to the tumult, the legate laid aside 
his canonicals and mounted his best horse in haste; and under 
the guidance of those who were acquainted with the less known 
fords, with much danger crossed the river at the nearest point, 
that he might the more quickly fly to the protection of the 
king’s wings.” 
It was out of such conditions as these, and the monastic 
ideals to which they gave birth, that the system of govern- 
ment common to English universities sprang up. The life 
of Oxford, in my own student days, was one of the best ex- 
amples of the survival, not of the fittest, but of the most unfit. 
In my judgment it was a striking anachronism. We lived 
in beautiful old Gothic buildings, arranged in series of quad- 
rangles, communicating with each other by narrow passage- 
ways, some of which were closed by iron gateways, and shut 
in from the outside world by barred windows wherever the 
buildings formed the external front, or by high walls rendered 
unscalable by iron spikes and railings where the beautiful 
gardens extended beyond the walls, while the great entrance 
was closed by a massive gateway only to be entered by a little 
wicket between the hours of 9 p. Mm. and 8 A. Mm. Inside this 
walled and barred retreat, the most minute report of the con- 
duct of the inmates was daily formulated and placed on file. 
He who was out after the hour of nine paid a fine proportion- 
ate to the hour of his return in order to be admitted. He who 
had a guest who left his college later than that hour paid a 
corresponding fine that his friend might be allowed to return 
to his own college. In every way the student felt that the 
college was in loco parentis, the parent which the college repre- 
sented being of a peculiarly suspicious temperament, and well 
assured that no opportunity for misconduct would be missed 
by his quasi son. And yet within these colleges from time 
immemorial has existed a spiritual relationship as sweet and as 
strong as has ever existed between teacher and taught, between 
master and disciple, or between parent and son—existed, I 
have sometimes thought, not because of the restraint imposed 
upon the younger, but despite it—and all the while both

  COLLEGE GOVERNMENT 385 
master and pupil have found their self-reliance, their independ- 
ence, and their self-assertion limited and atrophied by the 
feeling that they lived beneath so parental a system that effort 
and anxiety for their own usefulness were unnecessary; while, 
on the other hand, a more aggressive class, not used to having 
others think and act for them, have constantly chafed under 
the restraints of a home that was made a prison and the harsh- 
ness of a life that, in being made too easy, was made to antag- 
onize the dogged determination of English blood to think and 
act for itself. 
If we turn to the German universities, we are met by a 
great contrast. The student body, instead of being gathered 
into colleges under a strict and too careful regimen, are turned 
out into the world without any special care or attention. Here, 
as in the English universities, it is true that the authorities 
of the university have jurisdiction of public offenses com- 
mitted by students, and that as the Vice Chancellor holds a 
court in England, so the Rector holds his court in Germany. 
But the German student goes and comes at his own sweet will. 
He keeps no chapels, his lecture attendance is a matter of 
form rather than of requirement, no inquiry is made into his 
manner of life unless he comes in conflict with the city officials. 
Then he is brought before the city courts only to plead his 
university privileges and to have his case referred to the uni- 
versity court. The outcome is that for a time he will be put 
into what is supposed to be solitary confinement, in a room, 
or rooms, set apart for that purpose, usually on the topmost 
floor of the university building. The spell of seclusion is 
easily broken by a small fee paid to his jailer, and the prisoner, 
if at all popular, will make merry with his friends during the 
greater part of the time that his confinement lasts, enjoying 
such eatables and drinkables as his friends may see fit to pro- _ 
vide. Scarcely any more riotous scene is conceivable than an 
afternoon reception of a popular student in confinement. 
What a contrast is presented by the careful nightly prom- 
enade of the Oxford proctor inquiring into the presence or 
absence of cap and gown on students out for perfectly legiti-

mate purposes, with the processions to and from opera, theater, 
and concert hall constantly to be seen in any German univer- 
sity town! And yet it is probable that the order in the one 
institution is neither better nor worse than in the other. 
The fact appears to be that conduct is largely a matter of 
temperament, training, and temptation. The Oxford system 
has to contend with the more assertive British temperament, 
the more aggressive British training, and also itself, by exer- 
cising too great repression, throws constant temptation in 
the way of students. In importing the British system of 
education, our ancestors in many respects copied, not the 
English, but the Scotch, type. 
Retaining the dormitory system, they did not retain the 
remnants of monastic order, and, while establishing a definite 
system of government, tendered necessary by the early age 
at which the students of a century ago began their college 
course, they rather embraced the spirit than copied the form 
of college rule. Its theory was still parental. It was almost 
universally required that one or more tutors should reside in 
every college building. But it usually stopped there. And, 
wherever the tutor was possessed of a liberal spirit and kept 
himself in close touch and sympathy with college life, the 
arrangement was usually successful. It was often found, how- 
ever, that a tutor of poor judgment provoked more dissatisfac- 
tion and disorder than he prevented by his official authority. 
Yet the system of tutorial presence, if not supervision, in the 
dormitory is still popular. It exists in a great many colleges 
which have the dormitory system, and, by a large proportion 
of college officials, is regarded as desirable, if not essential. 
The most important purpose which these inmates of the col- 
lege buildings served was that, by learning the drift of college 
sentiment, they often brought the governing body to recognize 
it. And in this is to be found the key to the best college gov- 
ernment in our own country during the present century: a 
careful inquiry into college sentiment and the prompt correc- 
tion of it when misled, or an equally prompt recognition of 
it when in the right. For, as the students have increased in
-P-A-G-E-409
COLLEGE GOVERNMENT 387 
age, and as the self-consciousness of modern life has grown, 
the sober judgment of the great majority of students, in- 
fluenced more and more by the various expressions of public 
opinion, especially that voiced by the press, has become more 
and more worthy of consideration. Youth, which is always 
sensitive, has become critical as well. And as new institutions, 
often of state foundation, with larger liberty, have grown up 
in close neighborhood with the older colleges sometimes based 
upon methods evolved from older American ideals, but deeply 
influenced by new conditions largely derived from the study 
of German universities, the older colleges have had to reckon 
with a spirit of independence, self-reliance, and push generated 
by these new student bodies, keenly alive to the freedom of life 
in cities and large towns. More and more the colleges have 
drifted into a condition of anarchy tempered by good feeling, 
and the student body has been free to do what it would, except 
for temporary and sometimes violent assertions of authority 
in the face of external acts of lawlessness. 
This lawlessness, of which we have heard much in the past 
year, has largely been the result of old and evil traditions 
generated by the recklessness of boyhood under the restraints 
of the older methods—a recklessness which has not diminished 
in proportion as greater freedom has been secured. These tra- 
ditions survive in those which separate class and class, in those 
which dishonor our young manhood, as well as violate good 
order, in hazing, in cane rushes, and similar performances; in 
the old antagonism of town and gown, and various other dis-* 
orderly acts without excuse in any seat of learning, and espe- 
cially in colleges which have no roots in the distant past, when 
these things were the unhappy attendants of an unrefined 
condition of life. 
The problem before us is, how to develop a new theory of 
government which shall remove the temptations which period- 
ically appear, and regulate, as simply, and as nearly automatic- 
ally as possible, our college life. This problem involves a com- 
plete recasting of our views of what college life is and ought to 
be. It demands a recognition of the student as a free agent,
-P-A-G-E-410
  
  388 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
the complete abandonment of ideas drawn from feudalism and 
despotism, and the fundamental recognition of the facts (1) 
that students, when they enter college, assume certain definite 
obligations in the form of a simple contract; (2) that in the 
great majority of cases they are young men of earnest purpose, 
with a well-defined object in view; (3) and that, if given an 
opportunity to choose between right and wrong under natural 
conditions, they will almost inevitably choose the right. On 
the other hand, it must be recognized with equal clearness that 
the college is not a shop to which men may come and pur- 
chase what they wish in just the quantity they wish without 
reference to utility and a rational object. The college, as 
represented by its teaching body, is to lead; it is to direct men 
to truth; it is to provide a carefully-ordered and well-adjusted 
course, and all who enter the college must be guided and 
directed within certain well-defined limits to the ends which 
they themselves have chosen. And in the second place, it 
must be clearly recognized that the student body is immature, 
that its judgment is undeveloped, that it is subject to freaks 
and fancies, and must be protected against its own ill-consid- 
ered judgments. As a corollary to these two propositions, 
it may be further said that, in the discipline of the college, it 
may well be recognized that it is important to develop a thor- 
oughgoing habit of self-command and self-control as a part of 
the mental and moral discipline which intellectual training 
provides, and to this end nothing is more important than edu- 
cation in the forming of concrete judgments, and in making a 
rational choice between conflicting courses of conduct as pre- 
sented by questions involving social and governmental action 
even on a small scale. 
Thus societies and clubs often afford that training for public 
life which in the old New England town was received in the 
town meeting, and men learn in private affairs the art of exec- 
utive management with which they afterward may serve the 
state, and so they may learn in college government the funda- 
mental principles of co-operation and self-control in social and 
political relations which they will afterward need as citizens.
-P-A-G-E-411
     COLLEGE GOVERNMENT 389 
Certain of our colleges have already adopted a co-operative 
system by which the students have a definite and extensive 
part in college discipline. Others have only gone so far as to 
assign the regulation of such questions as examinations, which 
present peculiar temptations to some students, to the student 
body; and, thirdly, other institutions have regulated their 
dormitories by a so-called “house-system,” whereby the 
inmates of each house are permitted to control the affairs of 
their dormitory, even to the extent of electing its inmates. 
The Amherst system is the best illustration of the first of these. 
Princeton and Cornell have satisfactorily made trial of the 
second, while the University of Chicago is the best known 
exponent of the third. There are, however, in none of them 
any peculiarities or complex conditions which need to be 
especially explained. Everything turns on the simple ques- 
tion as to whether student co-operation is desirable, and, if 
desirable, possible. 
That student co-operation is desirable is now very generally 
admitted among younger members of faculties. It is prac- 
tically universally conceded that from seventy-five to ninety 
per cent. of the students have the interest of the college quite 
as much at heart as the faculty or trustees. The intense self- 
consciousness of modern college life, paraded as it is before the 
public in the daily and weekly press, has given the average 
student a keen desire to promote the reputation of the institu- 
tion to which he belongs. The great difficulty lies, first, in 
giving expression to this college sentiment, and, second, in 
eliminating the occasional acute activity of a few unruly spirits 
out of sympathy with the purpose for which colleges exist, and 
unfit to enjoy their privileges or to bear their responsibilities. 
The community, from whatever point of view we may look at 
it,—political, moral, or religious,—has always been the victim of 
such a class. The object of college discipline, viewed from the 
standpoint of such men, has come to be looked upon as one in 
which punishment is the principal thing, while the real object 
of college discipline is to protect the wesidue of the college 
family from the misconduct and the evil report engendered by
-P-A-G-E-412

these few. Yet even to these men the college owes an obliga- 
tion. The college cannot, any more than can the state, execute 
the highest penalties of the law upon men who merely throw 
themselves athwart the purposes of the state. The college 
ought occasionally to suppress men merely as public nuisances, 
a function once frequently exercised upon a higher plane by a 
bill of attainder. But the college, by also acting under con- 
tract, must be careful how it acts, especially in the absence of 
a well-proved concrete case. This care should be in direct 
proportion to the demand which it makes upon the students 
for a thorough recognition of the responsibility which they 
assume in their initial contract at matriculation. Give the 
seventy-five or more per cent. of students a voice in the deter- 
mination of college conduct, teach them how to use that voice, 
encourage them to think that it is their. reputation and the 
reputation of their college that is at stake, and, by an ener- 
getic public opinion, they will more effectively suppress the 
disorderly element than any law that can be applied can ever 
do. This will be an education which will give them a deeper 
interest, both as students and alumni in their alma mater, 
and will also be an important factor in their education as 
citizens. 
How this can be accomplished is not an easy question to 
answer broadly, and yet specifically it should not be difficult. 
One thing must be well guarded—the ideals of government 
must be kept in the hands of the faculty, and such a represen- 
tation must be secured for these ideals as will make them the 
standard toward which the whole system tends; and, in the 
second place, care must be taken to prevent what is not infre- 
quent in college life, as it is common in public life, the pos- 
sibility of the overweening influence in college councils of 
demagogues. In my own student days, I have known a stu- 
dent agitator, of shrewd and unscrupulous political capacity, 
to keep the whole college in hot water for weeks together over 
some fancied grievance which he was able from time to time 
to exaggerate into @ general conspiracy against the welfare of 
his fellow-students. I shall not undertake to outline any
-P-A-G-E-413

specific plan. So far as my own experience and inquiry have 
extended, I believe the Amherst plan to be the most success- 
ful thus far formulated. But Amherst has been fortunate in 
having to do with the descendants of a singularly earnest and 
law-abiding people. Other colleges must work upon less 
easily repressed and less homogeneous material, and yet I 
believe in this, as in all relations between student and faculty, 
that the fundamental principle is the same, and one that can 
be safely acted upon—the utmost mutual trust in the oneness 
of purpose of student and teacher, and the sincere confidence 
of each in the devotion of all to the institution to which they 
equally owe allegiance. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. A college dean has written of student self-government: “Stu- 
dent government implies the possession of mature judgment or con- 
trol of reason more than most persons of college age possess. At 
that time of life all are more easily moved by impulse and immediate 
advantage. Experience alone teaches men to seek an ultimate effect 
in preference to a near-by advantage. ‘The college life in this respect 
is a time of transition, often of revolution in attitude and action.” 
What answer could be made to this position? 2. Show how student 
self-government may be a valuable means of training for the responsi- 
bilities of citizenship. 3. What should be the scope of student self- 
government? Should it, for instance, attempt to regulate personal 
habits of students? 4. Describe the machinery of student self- 
government as it prevails at your college. If it does not prevail, 
draw up a plan that you think would suit your conditions.

DORMITORY LIFE FOR COLLEGE MEN + 
CHARLES FRANKLIN THWING 
[Charles Franklin Thwing (1853——) has been for many years president of 
Western Reserve University and Adelbert College. He is a frequent con- 
tributor to magazines on educational topics. Among the more notable 
of his writings in this field are History of Higher Education in America, 
Within College Walls, Universities of the World, The American College.] 
The word “dormitory,” in its present meaning, is a new word 
in academic language; in its present meaning it stands for a 
building used by a college for housing students. Mullinger, the 
historian of Cambridge, uses the word in contrast with “study” 
in speaking of a student of his university of about the year 
1550. The present meaning was formerly taken by the word 
“hostel,” or “college” or “hall.” The hostel of the English 
universities of three hundred years ago was a lodging house 
under the charge of a principal, where students resided at their 
own cost. This word was never transferred to America, but it 
has been transferred to India, Japan and China, and there is 
in quite as good usage as the blessed institution itself. The 
word “college” as applied to a building has been the favorite 
word in American academic usage. Williams College began in 
a building long known as West College. The brick row at Yale 
of eight buildings was composed of colleges, though “hall” was 
the term applied in the earlier time to the first. “Hall” is still 
used, and to it have been added “house” or “cottage” or “halls 
of residence,” especially as applied to women’s colleges. ‘‘Dor-

mitory” has, within fifty years, come into good use. It can 
hardly be called a fitting word except for those who wish, in 
their earnestness or wit, to represent the college life as torpid. 
The foundation of the older colleges was marked quite as 
much by the erection of a building for housing students as of 
one for holding lectures and recitations. In fact, one building 
usually served for all academic purposes. In the development 
of colleges, differentiation has occurred and buildings have been 
erected, designed for specific purposes. In the foundation of 
the newer colleges outside of New England, the custom of build- 
ing dormitories has not been constant. In fact, most state 
universities have declined to accept special responsibility for the 
domestic interests of students. These men and women have 
been left, in no small degree, to shift for themselves. Funds 
given by the state or by the individual have been required for 
the erection of libraries, laboratories and other halls. The ordi- 
nary home has opened its doors to students, glad to avail itself 
of means of increasing income, and students have been not 
loath to accept. 
The advantages of dormitory life are not hard to distinguish. 
One of the most apparent advantages lies in the tendency 
of this life to intensify academic atmosphere. The student is 
apart from his home: The building he occupies is made for 
the college; he lives with other students. With them he spends 
happy days and happier nights. The community is academic 
and of it he is an individual part. He “wears the gown” even 
if he does not, as the priest says in Kim, “follow the road.” 
His talk, his fun,,his tricks, his friendships, are all academic: 
he takes the academic bath. The worth of such absorption is 
great. At the altars of good fellowship and of opportunity, as 
well as at the shrine of scholarship, it is worth while to burn 
incense. Aloofness from common men’s common concerns is, 
for a time, as good for a boy as at other times it is despicable 
and disastrous. The idols which men outside of the walls and 
the gates worship make no appeal to him. The value of un- 
worldliness is pressed down hard upon his mind. The lawn, 
the quad, the hall, the campus, the yard, are holy ground. The
-P-A-G-E-416
  304 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
interpretation which memory makes of such academic condi- 
tions represents their value. What a storm of protestation oc- 
curs from the intimation of a college Board of Trustees of 
the tearing down of a dormitory. “Sacrilege” is the comment. 
Even the taking down of a college fence awakens national com- 
ment. Mr. Lowell once said that when a family leaves its 
ancestral home, the house should be burned down. A college 
dormitory is so sacred to the generations of students that it 
should stand forever. 
A dormitory, moreover, fosters that thing or that being 
called college spirit. College spirit, all the college papers are 
ever declaring, the college lacks. College spirit, they lament, 
is not now what it once was. College spirit, they affirm, we 
must now have. “Go to, now,” add these editors, “we will get 
college spirit.” College spirit, what is it? This is the formula: 
—love of teacher and student for the college plus submission 
of the individual to the general academic good, plus apprecia- 
tion by students of the highest ideals, plus songs and sports as 
expressing college devotion—those constitute college spirit. Col- 
lege spirit represents men living in close association. To make 
the fire of college spirit all the pieces of the kindling wood of 
the student life must lie close together. College spirits make 
college spirit. 
Dormitory life, moreover, has the advantage of teaching 
students to get on with each other. It frees from cantanker- 
ousness. This ability of association, or of consociation, is of 
the highest worth. College men, when they fail, though, in fact, 
they seldom do fail, fail for one of two reasons. Either lack 
of moral fiber or inability to get on with their fellows. The 
second cause is far more common. No life represents so effi- 
cient a means for the removal in tendency to cantankerousness 
as the dormitory. Men must live under the same conditions. 
They must live together in time, as well as in space. These 
forces and methods cut out eccentricities, turn angularities into 
curves, make men reasonable. There is developed social taste, 
a social conscience, a social mind, a social heart and a social 
will. There is nourished a fine and noble democracy in the in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-417
  COMMUNITY LIFE OF THE COLLEGE 395 
dividual and a no less noble and fine individuality in the aca- 
demic democracy. 
In this same relation dormitory life has the advantage of 
formation of friendships—friendships which prove to be the 
most intimate and of life-long continuance. The memory of 
each man calls up such friendships. Let me, however, refer to 
one or two. I turn to a biography of Archbishop Tait and I 
find him writing of his going to Oxford. He says: “Arrived 
. at Oxford, I took possession of my rooms in the top attics of 
Balliol, as completely a garret as could be imagined. I was 
at once introduced to George Moberly, Tutor of Balliol, whose 
favor had been bespoken for me. He asked me to breakfast 
with him next morning, which was Sunday. The party con- 
sisted of Herman Merivale—whom I had already begun to 
know—Manning—whom I never did know well—and Stephen 
Dennison.”* 
He mentions the scholars of Balliol and his friends, among 
whom were Arthur Stanley, Jowett, Sir Stafford Northcote, Ar- 
thur Clough and Lord Coleridge, and he says that the men 
with whom he lived habitually acquired the name of “the fam- 
ily.” I turn to the life of Tennyson. Everyone knows of “the 
Apostles.” The friends among whom he lived were Lord 
Houghton, Archbishop Trench, Dean Alford and Hallam. Such 
friendships arise naturally in the common life of the dormitcry. 
I turn to the biography of Bishop Westcott and I read that 
among his contemporaries at Cambridge were C. B. Scott, late 
Headmaster of Westminster School; J. E. B. Mayor, Professor 
of Latin, formerly University Librarian; J. L. Davies, the well- 
known theologian, Vicar of Kirkby Lonsdale, and Chaplain 
in Ordinary to the King; D. J. Vaughan, Vicar of St. Martin’s, 
Leicester, and Hon. Canon of Peterborough; A. Barry, Canon 
of Windsor, formerly Bishop of Sydney; Howson, late Dean 
of Chester, and Hon. E. H. Stanley, late Earl of Derby, for- 
merly Secretary of State for the Colonies.’ 
I also wish to say that I look upon the dormitory as at once

the safest moral place and the strongest agency for forming 
character. I do not fail to recognize that grave dangers await 
college men, both within and without dormitory walls. We all 
know the nature of these perils. They are, comprehensively, 
the perils of appetite. But the dormitory represents a condition 
in which supervision can be exercised and always should be. 
The college stands as an official and personal guardian, but the 
dormitory offers, too, the means and the opportunity of forming 
the strongest character. Man comes closest toman. No haven 
of the home offers a snug harbor of moral refuge. Brother meets 
brother, and comes into brotherhood. No fugitive and cloistered 
man is to nurture a virtue or a man fugitive and cloistered. 
Each man teaches each man, forming, reforming, inspiring each 
and all. The floor of every dormitory room is a battlefield 
where men have fought our great personal moral issues, and in 
the field they, like Jacob, have prevailed. 
Before I pass on to some of the objections to dormitory life, 
I wish to refer to one other advantage. It is found in the fact 
that the college memories of the graduate are most vivid of the 
personal and material relations of his dormitory home. No 
such memories does he hold remembering library or club table. 
His thought turns back to Hollis, to Main or to North. He has 
no such affection for recitation hall or for physics laboratory. 
When he returns to his twenty-fifth or fortieth anniversary, he 
seeks out the dormitory room and enters its doorway as a shrine. .

The same gray flats again, and felt 
The same, but not the same; and last 
Up that long walk of limes I past 
To see the rooms in which he dwelt. 
Another name was on the door; 
I lingered; all within was noise 
Of songs, and clapping hands, and boys 
That crash’d the glass, and beat the floor; 
Where once we held debate, a band 
Of youthful friends, on mind and art, 
And labour, and the changing mart, 
And all the framework of the land.* 
Yet there are disadvantages and difficulties in the dormitory 
- life for college men. 
These disadvantages arise from the necessary conditions and 
methods of fifteen or fifty or more men of the age of twenty 
years living together in one building. The disadvantages are 
the’disadvantage of too great fréedom, of too great individual 
independence. The freedom may be too great for the intellect: 
the peril of unwise methods of work or bad mental habits results. 
The freedom may be too great for the conscience: evil moral 
practices may follow: The freedom may be too great for the 
will: the peril of foolish practices may prevail. The freedom 
may be too great for the character: the peril of physical intel- 
lectual and moral debasement may become evident. Physical 
disorder, boisterousness, rowdyism is not uncommon. The in- 
terruption of a man’s study by the invasion of a half dozen 
men, or the wasting of his evening with the slow-going caller, 
are necessary evils. The sense of individuality in property is 
ravaged. The application of “meum” and “teum” becomes 
mixed. Good-natured borrowing of books and of clothes is too 
much suffered. 
The comprehensive difficulty of dormitory life lies in the lack 
of solitude. It is hard to find a chance to be alone. Some men 
do not wish to be alone; they are alone when they are alone. 
To change the remark of Newman, they are most alone when 
° 1Tennyson’s In Memoriam. 
 
-P-A-G-E-420
  308 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
most alone, but they ought to be alone, if not lonely. Other 
men wish to be alone. In loneliness they are like Newman, least 
alone. “If you have a mind, use it,” said Walter Bagehot, 
“it is the most interesting thing.” But those who like and those 
who dislike solitude should enter into the halls of silence. 
Thought, feeling, sentiment, are fed in great, quiet atmosphere. 
In noble solitudes rich characters and rich intellects are devel- 
oped. 
The chief element in a dormitory is its spirit, its life, its 
tone. This fine atmosphere depends first, on the students 
themselves; second, on the head of the house. The students 
should be organized into some society for promoting the com- 
mon interest. The organization may have several officers, or 
may take on the form of a committee. Orderliness, fellowship, 
sympathy, helpfulness, are the key-notes of such a communistic 
process. Second, upon the head of the hovse quite as largely 
depends its worth. For there should be a head. The practice 
obtaining in some colleges of leaving the boys to themselves 
in a great dormitory is to be deprecated. The peril of dis- 
order, of danger in case of fire, is great. This head should... 
also be a heart, and both should be embodied in a college: 
officer. The higher his official rank, the more influence: has: 
the head of the house, but beyond his official rank lies his 
personal character and ‘pearing. He is in some places called a: 
proctor. He is never to be regarded as a policeman or prison 
warden. He is here as a friend, guide and counsellor. His 
interest, care, oversight, should be close, but not too close. 
Jane Austin somewhere makes one of her characters say that 
“Oatmeal should be thin, thin, thin, but not too thin.” The 
supervision of the dormitory officer should be: close, but not’ 
too close—close enough to show friendship, wise, *true, con- 
stant—but not so close as to give the impression of undue 
watchfulness which would free the student from the sense’ of 
personal responsibility. Such friendship is hard enough to 
‘secure. It represents the best type of* character; it embodies 
genius for boys. Such a friend was Edward Bowen of Harrow. 
Of him it is said by one who knew him well: “If I attempted’, 
 
-P-A-G-E-421
     
COMMUNITY LIFE OF THE COLLEGE 309 
to classify his interests, I should be inclined to say that he cared 
for things somewhat in the following order: boys, literature, 
games, history, walks, politics. . . . His friendship with his 
boys held the first place in his heart. . . . He gave his life to his 
boys.’”’? But also it is said: “He had a great power of making 
older boys judge themselves, and offer an adequate punishment 
of an intellectual kind for their shortcomings. Throughout in 
all matters there was an appeal to the boy himself, to his best 
part, to his conscience. To train the conscience so that its dis- 
cernment of right and wrong was clear, and the following of 
it was habitual, was his method. If there was no conscience, 
then still there was to be found something to appeal to. I 
have. known him keep a very bad and weak boy straight for 
a while by an appeal to his honor as a gentleman, when it 
seemed that nothing could influence him.”? Benson, writing 
of the schoolmaster, says, that he should be “easy, friendly, 
conversational.” He also commends “courage, approbation, ap- 
preciation, a ready smile, an agreeable manner, a rebuke given 
in the form of a compliment, as most effective.”* These are 
the great qualities belonging to the head of a dormitory which 
help to transmute it into a condition and force, not simply for 
living, but for life.

[College spirit is the esprit de corps among college men, the 
feeling shared by all who have breathed the same college atmos- 
phere? That each successful college must have a college atmos- 
phere and that this atmosphere must find its expression in 
college spirit we are all agreed. We do not seem quite so sure 
as to the best form this spirit should take. Doubtless the 
atmosphere should be one of plain living and high thinking, 
with flashes of color from men of gifted personality; one of mutual 
help and forbearance, with the struggles and rewards of after- 
life showing more or less clearly in perspective. Doubtless the 
college spirit should be one of comradery in worthy ambitions, 
of full-tempered jollity, with a strong undercusgiilllRomething 
which is very like patriotism. Not “my college right or 
wrong,” but “‘my college; when she is wrong, I will do every- 
thin, make her right. I believe in her. I glory in her good 
e. I wish her degree to be a mark of honor. I will sacri- 
fice.my convenience, my fun, my success even to save her good 
name from tarnish.” 
There is no better definition of the college spirit than that 
given in the old University of Greifeswald nearly four hundred 
yearsago. This was.the phrase of Ulrich von Hutten, “‘Gemein- 
geist unter freien Geistern,” \Comradeship among free spirits.” 
“Free should the scholar be, fret.and brave”; for men whose 
minds are free should find harmony in action. The true college 
spirit is the\working together of good men for good end\, for * 
broad, fearless} helpful life, arising from sound impulses within.

   COMMUNITY LIFE OF THE COLLEGE 401 
We breed college spirit by the development of college men 
of the broad, large, helpful, hopeful type. To this end we must 
do away with the dread of “the rod behind the mirror.” We 
must make college work not a succession of pointless tasks, but 
every part of it must _be made real, vital,—a part of life, “strik- 
ing the heart of the youth in flame.” We must offer as rewards 
not cheap toys and prizes, but incentives which are natural and 
enduring. For him who works, large room for work should be 
opened. The idlers should be taken to the edge of the campus 
and quietly dropped off. The privileges of the college belong 
to: those who can use them. Co-working comes from working. 
Without habits 0f industry there can be no sound college spirit. 
Vices divide men. Virtue brings them together. With idle- 
ness banished from the campus, most of the other vices of aca- 
demic life would soon disappear. . 
In this matter false notions are prevalent. I have heard 
college presidents, who have tried to promote industry, accused 
of “breaking up college spirit” as though idleness and trickery, 
in the topsy-turvy college world, had come to stand among 
the virtues. To make the college a place of serious work is to 
prepare the way for college spirit. It is clearing the ground 
for better crops. (he true college spirit considers the good of 
the college, not.the“pleasure of the individual. To do one’s 
level best for the college and for one’s fellows, leaves no selfish 
‘residuum. It was a Princeton man who, when his leg was broken 
in the football field, rejoiced that it was not-one of the first 
team that was hurt., This is a type of the Princeton spirit, 
and it arises from the football field to make its influence felt 
in other things. It is college spirit that leads the player to 
struggle like a bulldog in the game when a moment’s weakening 
would mean defeat. It is college spirit of the same sort which 
leads the men to cheer the good play of their rivals. In little 
things as in big, it is the one who is most courteous to his rivals, 
most considerate among his equals, who will never let go when 
he ought to hold on. 
There are other kinds of spirit abroad in college life and some 
of these the ignorant mistake for college spirit. I have heard
-P-A-G-E-424
  402 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
of spirits of mischief, of spirits that dance by night, of spirits of 
rye, and spirits that arise from a beer cask. There are some 
who think that spirits of such sorts are all that a college can 
produce, and that college spirit at the best is but another name 
for deviltry and dissipation. But the conviviality of the 
“beer-bust” or the champagne supper is but a spurious imita- 
tion of the good-fellowship of sane men. 
After a great game of football in a large city, I passed, one 
evening, by the open door of a fashionable saloon. It was full 
of college boys, resplendent in the green and gray of their 
college celebrating on unsteady legs their team’s great victory. 
With faces as red as the sweaters of their opponents they were 
singing maudlin college songs, full of patriotic liquor. They 
thought themselves possessed of college spirit. But the passers- 
by did not look on the scene in that light. It was clear to them 
that certain college men mistook drunkenness for manliness, 
and after the fashion of passers-by, they threw the whole blame 
on the college. \Ihe students of a college fix its reputation, 
and it may take years of honest effort to outgrow a single 
drunken escapade. 
T once heard a graduate of the Boston Institute of Technology 
make this plea to a body of students of another institution: 
“Never carry your colors into a saloon. If you must disgrace 
yourself, do it in the name of someone else. When we visited a 
saloon in Boston,” he said, ‘we always gave the Harvard yell.” 
You may not care for your own disgrace, but do not make your 
college party to it. If you must visit saloons to express your 
feelings, do not take your college with you. If you must 
scream, give the other fellow’s yell. Perhaps if you do this, some 
other fellow may whip the breath out of you. Be a martyr if 
it must be, but die rather than disgrace your college. 
\fo form a college atmosphere, there should be free intercourse 
.. ong the students. The professional schools of a university 
a be in a great city, but a college should be in a town so small 
** that college interests overshadow all others. The college spirit 
burns dimly in a great city. A small town and a large campus 
represent the ideal condition, with a great city not too far aways

—=» COMMUNITY LIFE OF THE COLLEGE 403 
Higher education mostly begins when a boy goes away from 
home. You cannot get it on the street cars. In the German 
universities they recognize two classes of university men, real 
students and “spur-studenten,” or railway-track students, 
those who live at home and come and go without becoming an 
actual part of the university. In a great city all students are 
likely to “spur-studenten.” Unless men can get together, 
college spirit and college atmosphere are well-nigh impossible. 
The unrest in regard to the four years’ college course in our 
great urban universities stands in evidence of this fact. The 
men want to get into professional work, because the college 
course lacks its best element, the force of comradeship. 
If our college faculties had the academic courage and aca- 
demic patriotism which our people have the right to demand of 
them, most of the evils of college life would speedily disappear. 
The worst training a young man can have is that of physical 
and intellectual idleness. Free education should be reserved 
for those who have the mind and the will to receive it. There is 
no education without effort. ‘Those who do not want an educa- 
tion have no place in college. A firm insistence on the demands 
of scholarship would do away with rowdies and rowdyism. 
It is not often the real scholar that leads in rushing and hazing. 
The class rush is a product of sheer rowdyism. . It is the work 
of the college bullies. It is dangerous because it has no time 
limit, no rules, no training. When a man is hurt in its rough- 
and-tumble activity, the blame falls, and rightly so, on the 
college. 
Of the same nature is hazing, with this difference that hazing 
is essentially the coward’s part. It is half a dozen against one, 
and always involves infringement of the rights and liberties 
of free men. Such affairs are not indications of college spirit. 
They are not, like amateur athletics, in aid of the good name of 
the college. It does not enhance the reputation of one of our 
great universities that the papers are full of the hair-cutting 
scapes of her freshmen and sophomores. It adds nothing 'to the 
glory of another institution of honored name that her sopho- 
mores break up the freshmen dance by throwing skunks into nm

  the ball-room. It is against the good name of any college that 
sophomore bullies carry away freshman class presidents or 
lock up the escorts of ladies at a junior ball. It is not to the 
credit of any institution that bogus programs and anonymous 
insults, inane or obscene, are circulated on its campus, Stealing 
ice-cream is very much like ordinary stealing, andLrowdyism 
in all its forms makes the development of honest college spirit 
hopeless. Comradeship among free spirits——what*decent man 
cares to be the comrade of a bully? 
It is a weakness of our state universities that their students 
sometimes mistake rowdyism for spirit and brutality for de- 
mocracy. These institutions are thoroughly democratic, that 
is a matter of course, but we must not forget that democracy is 
not inconsistent with courtesy. \Other things being equal, the 
better the manners, the better the man. “The same spirit that 
leads to rowdyism in a state institution reappears as imbecility 
in some other kinds of colleges. There is little choice between 
the two. It is lack of inventive power that leads the midnight 
student to take the president’s carriage to pieces, to put his 
cow into the bell-tower or to stack up the gates of the town in 
his back yard. It is imbecility that leads college men to assert 
their own independence by discourtesy to college women. It is 
imbecility that causes college boys to take up one after another a 
series of unpleasant fads, the fad of swiping signs, of stealing 
spoons, of running away with some one’s bric-4-brac. 
Another peculiarly disagreeable fad, caught from the street 
gamin, is seen or heard at some of our athletic games. The mob 
at a ball game tries to rattle the pitcher, to confuse the catcher, 
or to so crowd about that an opposing team has not only the 
local team to meet, but the whole student body as well. It is 
not genuine college spirit that has turned many a football 
game in the Middle West into something very much like a 
riot. The institution that permits this sort of thing consents 
to its own disgrace. It is upon the apathy of college faculties 
is _ that the blame must finally rest. It is for such performances 
as these that aristocratic Harvard has invented the term of 
- “mucker.” Whatever else Harvard may be, she is “anti-

mucker” through and through. The movement toward ath- 
letic courtesy perhaps had its origin in Harvard, and I hope 
for the spread of its influence. When a Yale batter strikes a 
foul and returns to his base, he finds the Harvard catcher 
handing him his bat. That a man may play a strenuous game, 
the fiercest ever seen on the gridiron and yet keep the speech 
and manners of a gentleman, is one of the lessons Harvard 
may teach us, and We of the West cannot listen to any better 
lesson in college spirit. 
Our student bodies as well as our college faculties have been 
too tolerant of petty trickery. This is shown in student elec- 
tions, which would often give points to the most corrupt of city 
governments. {The man of college spirit will vote for the best 
representative of the college. The vulgar college politician sees 
only the chance of combination. yMany men will even prostitute 
their fraternity relations by making that association a mere 
means of political influence. President White used to call 
“college politics a pewter imitation of a pinchbeck original.” 
I have never known a successful politician of the “win at any 
cost” sort who became a useful man in after-life. I have known 
some who have risen in politics—risen for a while until they 
have been found out. As grown men they have disgraced the 
state, just as, when boys, they brought their college into ill- vw i 
repute. (Cheating in examinations is of a piece with cheating 
in politics. sound college spirit finds no place for such things. 
The same evil spirit which at times controls student elections 
often works havoc with the usefulness of athletics. I believe 
thoroughly in college athletics. I have taken my part in them 
in college and out, and I know that other things being equal, 
the athletic man is worth more to the community than other 
kinds of men. But other things may not be equal. The ath- 
letic tramp should receive no academic welcome. The athletic 
parasite is no better than any other parasite. /'The man whois _, 
in college for athletics alone, disgraces the college, degrades . 7

     institutions stand disgraced in the eyes of the college world, by 
reason of the methods employed to win football victories. 
At the best, athletics is a by-play in the business of education, 
most useful, in their place, but most damaging if it breaks down 
academic standards. To relieve football men from all necessity 
of scholarship during the football period is to strike a blow 
at the dignity and honesty of the college. More than one insti- 
tution is doing this at the present time. The college that 
does its duty to its students is the one in which the football 
tramp, the professional athlete, finds no place. Nothing I have 
seen in the University of Missouri had pleased me more than 
the firm stand it has taken for decency in athletics, and that 
too when the traditions of fraud, the impulse to win at a cost, 
were at their very strongest. 
v eo the girls as well as on the boys falls the duty of main- 
t ning college spirit. To create the sense of manly dignity is 
largely woman’s work\ To be drawn into college combinations 
and voted like lambs at the will of some shrewd manipulator 
has been too often women’s experience in college politics. 
y Young women, think for yourselves. Don’t ask the politicians 
how the candidates stand. You can get better information 
from the registrar. Don’t behave as if you needed a guardian. 
Don’t carry your social affairs into the recitation rooms. Let 
society have its place and time, but do not mix these demands 
with those of study. If there are too many balls in college 
society and they last too long, have the courage to refuse to go, 
the courage to refuse to stay after it is time for sleep.’ If 
dances run on without time limit, as they do in some places, £ 
is your duty to make your-own limit, before the’faculty awake 
to its responsibility and lays down your duty for you. Do not 
be put into false positions. Young men value youig women 
more when their society is not to be had too easily, I heard 
the ‘other day these words uttered by a student, ‘and they 
were words of wisdom: “When a girl’s ‘name is bandied 
about the campus; it is a hard proposition for her to live it down.”

not harm them. The reputation of the college is made by its 
students, women as well as men, and on the women rests a 
large responsibility for the growth of a healthy college spirit. 
he process of “knocking” is opposed to the growth of college 
spirit. There is no use in complaining for complaint’s sake. 
If you don’t like things as they are, turn in and make them 
better, or go somewhere else. If the habit of faultfinding is 
deep-seated, learn your college song. Practice at nights upon 
your college yell. It will do you good. There is a great moral 
lesson in learning to shout in unison. To “root” in perfect 
time at the call of the yell-leader is a college education in itself. 
To keep in touch with men is the best antidote for cynicism. 
Snobbishness is opposed to college spirit. It is not a fault 
of the West, where few students are reared on Mellin’s food 
and finished on champagne. We have few young men who 
tread on velvet and take a college course by proxy. The 
Harvard man who keeps a groom for his horse, a groom for 
himself, and a groom for each of his studies, has few imitators 
in the West: In the strenuous rugged West, there is little 
room for the “Laodicean Club,” the association of those who 
are neither hot nor cold, but altogether luke-warm. 
‘But if we lack the perfect aristocrat, we have in the West 
our own cliques and divisions. The fraternity system at its 
best is an aid to scholarship, to manners and to character; 
at its worst, it is a basis for vulgar dissension. The influence of 
a_ fraternity’ depends on the men who are in it. If these are 
“ ‘ove the average in character and work, it is lucky for the 
sverage man to be chosen into it. If they are below the average 
in this regard, the average man loses by joining his fortunes 
with it. - When fraternities are sources of disorganization, there 
is something wrong in them or in the institution. 
The evil of dissipation exists in college outside of it. The 
average boy, or rather the boy a little below the average, 
believes that some degree of manliness inheres in getting drunk. 
Bismarck is reputed to have said that in the universities -of 
Germany “one-third the students work themselves to death, . .

one-third drink themselves to death, and the other third gov- 
ern Europe.” Something like this takes place in America 
though the percentage of those who die of drink is less and the 
percentage of those who die of hard work is still lower. But 
too many of our college students have wrecked their lives even 
before they have realized the strength and the duties of man- - 
hogd. 
vie finest piece of mechanism in all the universe is the brain 
of man. \In this complex structure, with its millions of con- 
necting célls, we can form images of the world about us, correct 
so far as they go. To retain these images, to compare them, 
to infer relations of cause and effect and to transfer thought 
into action is man’s privilege. In proportion to the exactness 
of these operations is the soundness, the value of the man. 
The wise man protects his brain, and the mind, which is its 
manipulator, from all that would do harm. Vice is our name 
for self-inflicted injury, and every stimulant or narcotic—every 
drug that leaves its mark of weakness on the brain, is the 
beginning of vice. Vice means brain decay. “Death is a thing 
cleaner than vice,” and in the long run it is more profitable.

tion, a mind trained to think and act, a nervous system true as a 
dial in its response to environment? Will you, college boy of 
the twentieth century, let him come in his time as a man among 
men? Or will you throw away his patrimony? Will you turn 
over to him a brain distorted, a mind diseased, a will untrained

In all our colleges we are taught that the athlete must not 
break. training rules. The pitcher who smokes a cigarette 
gives away the game. The punter who dances loses the goal, 
the sprinter who takes a convivial glass of beer breaks no record. 
His record breaks him. Some day we shall realize that the 
game Of life is more strenuous than the game of football, more 
intricate than pitching curves, more difficult than punting. We 
should keep‘in trim for it. We“must remember the training 
rules. {he rules that win the football game are good also for 
success in business. Half the strength of young America is 
wasted in the dissipation of drinking or smoking. If we keep 
the training rules of life in literal honesty, we shall win a host 
of prizes that otherwise we should lose. \Final success goes to 
the few, the very few, alas, who throughout life keep mind and 
soul and body clean. 
“Gemeingeist unter freien Geistern,” the “comradeship of 
free souls,”—this is the meaning of true college spirit. Freedom 
of the soul means freedom of the mind, freedom of the brain. 
It is said in the litany that His “service is perfect freedom.” 
Ignorance holds men in bondage; so do selfishness, stupidity 
and vice. The service of God and of man is found in casting off 
these things. In freedom we find abundance of life. The scholar 
should be a man in the full life of the world. ‘The color of life 
is red,” and the scholar of to-day is no longer a dim-eyed monk

TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. Discuss the meaning and value of college spirit. 2. What part 
do custom and conformity seem to play in determining what is or 
what is not a proper display of college spirit? 3. Enlarge on the 
point that students fix the reputation of a college by criticising certain 
practices among the students of your own college which tend to be 
injurious to its good name. 4. Discuss some of the ways of manifest-

ing college spirit other than in connection with athletics. 5. Point 
out some of the things in your institution that might be viewed as 
hindrances to the development of college spirit. 6. Discuss the ad- 
vantages or disadvantages of the class rush. 7. Hazing or helpful-

HONOR IN STUDENT LIFE IN COLLEGES AND 
UNIVERSITIES ! 
CHARLES ALPHONSO SMITH 
[Charles Alphonso Smith (1864: ) is the Edgar Allan Poe professor of 
English in the University of Virginia. In 1910-11 he lectured at the 
University of Berlin as Roosevelt exchange professor of American history 
and institutions. This selection was presented as a paper before the 
Department of Higher Education of the National Educational Association 
at the meeting in July, 1905.]   
In the fourth book of his work on “The German Universities” 
Dr. Friedrich Paulsen analyzes student honor into three con- 
stituent elements: courage, independence, and _truth-telling. 
This analysis, however, besides being purely abstract, looks 
more to the foundation of student honor than to the superstruc- 
ture. The analysis given by Mr. Le Baron Russell Briggs, 
. dean of the faculty of arts and sciences in Harvard University, 
is more concrete because it is based on the actual working out 
of honor ideals in cellege life. “Want of a fine sense of honor,” 
says he,? “appears chiefly i in athletic contests, in the author- 
ship of written work, in excuses for neglect of study, in the 
relation of students to the rights of persons who are not students, 
~ and in questions of duty to all who are, or who are to be, nearest 
and dearest.” These defects Mr. Briggs considers “a part 
of that lopsided immaturity which characterizes privileged 
youth.”

COMMUNITY LIFE OF THE COLLEGE 41 
Without attempting an adequate analysis of student honor, 
either of its excellences or of its defects, it may be said that 
the most popular error in regard to the subject is to view it 
wholly as a phase of ethics. Student honor is only partly a 
thing of the conscience. One of the most effective appeals 
that I ever heard made to a band of college hazers was based 
not so much on the view that hazing is wrong as that it is 
puerile and common. The students were told that society 
is coming more and more to regard hazing as belonging with 
slovenly speech, loud neckties, and even eating with the knife. 
The appeal was made with tact and sympathy, the students 
seeming to feel that their honor had been invoked because 
nothing was said about the Ten Commandments or the Golden 
Rule. Student honor, as it exists in our colleges and univer- 
sities to-day, is only in part, therefore, an ethical dictate; it is 
rather a curious blend of conscience and convention, of in- 
dividualism on the one hand and compliance with the canons 
of good form on the other. Being essentially a communal 
sentiment, a faculté d’ensemble, it is peculiarly susceptible to: 
the consensus of opinion prevailing in its own college and in 
the colleges that form its social or athletic environment. A 
college president writes: “I am almost coming to the con- 
clusion that student honor is based entirely upon campus senti- 
ment, and refuses to receive any other standard. . . . 
Convince one team that all the other college teams sign certain 
pledges as a matter of form, and they will consider themselves 
justified in doing the same.” ’ 
Another misconception is, to regard student honor as in- 
stinctive or intuitive, as having the simplicity of the great 
emotions and but little affinity with the analytic distinctions 
and reasoned processes of the intellect. Shakespeare’s un- 
answered question of fancy may be asked with equal perti- 
nency of student honor: 
“Tell me where is fancy bred, 
Or in the heart or in the head?” 
Undoubtedly the impulses of student honor come chiefly from 
 
-P-A-G-E-434
412 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
the feelings, but the code of student honor frequently finds 
place for more subtle distinctions than ever vexed the brain of 
rabbi or scholiast. It recalls at times the phrase with which 
Charles Lamb characterized the comedy of the Restoration: 
he called it “the sanctuary and quiet Alsatia of hunted cas- 
uistry.” 4 
But when all is said, student honor remains an asset of 
incalculable moral, social, and civic worth. You may smile at 
it now and then; you will more often be thrilled by it. \Its 
inconsistencies are apparent, ‘but student life would be gross 
and sordid without it. No college discipline would be tolera- 
ble that did not strive with sympathy and patience to identify’ 
itself with the honor ideals of its students. No teacher would 
deserve the name that did not seek in the classroom and out 
of it to invest these ideals with ever increasing worth and 
dignity. Student honor needs above all else neither praise nor 
blame but recognition, enlightenment, and codperation. 
That it has not ‘received the consideration that it: impor- 
tance merits is evidenced by the dearth of literature pearing 
on the subject. It is true that more attention is now given to 
the ethical aspects of education than ever before: the ethical 
note is more often and more clearly sounded; but student 
honor, though it is unquestionably the strategic point in stu- 
dent character, has received but scant notice from writers on 
educational themes. No thorough treatment of the subject has 
yet been attempted and no concerted action has been taken. If 
we believe in the primacy of character rather than in. the 
primacy of mere intellect, we cannot afford to ignore the 
standards of honor and dishonor that students impose upon 
themselves and that effect more or less permanently their 
character in after-years. If this paper, therefore, does nothing 
else than call attention to an oversight and a need, it will 
at least justify its niche in the program. 
While it is true that student honor is measured to-day chiefly 
by the student’s deportment on examinations and on the 
athletic field, there was a time when the phrase connoted pri- 
marily the student’s bearing toward the faculty and toward 
 
-P-A-G-E-435

the property-owners in the neighborhood of the college or 
university. In both these respects, however, there has been a 
significant change for the better. Organized rebellions against 
college authority are comparatively rare. They occur at 
times, and perhaps will occur throughout the century; but 
they are exceptional and marked by less violence and rowdy- 
ism than in earlier years. They arose out of conditions which 
are now obsolescent if not obsolete. Foremost among these 
were the petty restrictions imposed by faculties and enforced 
by a system of espionage and inquisitorial investigation that «. 
rarely failed to beget an insurrectionary feeling on the part of 
the students. In many cases students were not only not 
trusted, but their very presence at a college or university 
seemed the warrant of suspicion. They were expressly for- 
bidden to do what only the most versatile ingenuity would 
ever have thought of doing. In the inhibitions launched 
against them no attempt was made to discriminate between 
‘the malum prohibitum and the malum in se. This is a dis- 
tinction, however, that students never fail to make, and, be 
it said to their credit, their insistence on their natural rights, 
together with their consistent opposition to artificial and un- 
necessary restrictions, has had its share in bringing about the 
era of better things. “The- history of the government of 
the students in American colleges,” says Dr. Thwing, “is a 
history of increasing liberality and orderliness,” of increasing 
orderliness because of increasing liberality. 
There has been also a corresponding change in the attitude 
of college students toward those living in the college environ- 
ment. Conflicts between gownsmen and townsmen are no 
longer a settled feature of college life. This consummation is 
to be ascribed in part to the growth of college towns and to 
the attendant blending of student life with a larger social and 
civic life. It has been brought about also by the greater 
attention now paid to the physical comfort of students in 
dormitories and lecture rooms, by the modernization of the 
curriculum, and by the wider introduction of the elective sys- 
tem. The adaptation of student to study, which it is the aim  
-P-A-G-E-436
  414. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
of the elective system to effect, leaves little room for the rest- 
less leisure that used to vent itself on signboards and hen 
roosts. Congenial work and plenty of it will do more to har- 
monize a student to his surroundings than all the formal regu- 
lations or systems of espionage that the mind of man could 
devise. 
But while there has been improvement in the respects noted, 
student standards have still their inconsistencies. The two 
nerve centers of student honor are now athletics and examina- 
tions. It would be hard to overrate the significance of ath- 
letics in modern college life. Time was when the commence- 
ment exercises furnished the chief point of contact between the 
collective life of the student body and the outside public. The 
point of intersection is now the intercollegiate game of foot- 
ball or baseball. Both games are characteristically American 
and have proved effective agencies for the discipling e° manili- 
ness and the development;of college spirit. The popularity 
of these games, however, and especially the unprecedented in- 
terest in football, have grown faster than the means devisetl to 
meet and control the abuses connected with them. Methods 
of safeguarding intercollegiate athletics are yet in an experimen- 
tal stage. While I have perfect faith in the ultimate com- 
petency of student honor, reénforced by the American love of 
a square deal, to meet the exigencies presented, the duty of the 
hour is to educate public sentiment in ande outside of our 
colleges so that it will despise the doctrine of victory at any 
price. This is the slogan that is responsible more than any- 
thing else for the lie signed to the examination paper as well 
as for the lying evasion of the aspiring athlete. 
In intercollegiate athletics, as practiced in nearly all of our 
American ‘colleges and universities, a student becomes in- 
eligible who has received or is receiving compensation “direct 
or indirect” for his athletic services. This inhibition, it is 
true, strikes at the root of athletic commercialism; but there 
has grown up a code of casuistry in the interpretation of this 
clause that threatens to undermine the integrity of athletic 
ideals. The faculties of our colleges have here a rare oppor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-437
  
COMMUNITY LIFE OF THE COLLEGE 415 
tunity and duty. It is a duty requiring tact, insight, courage, 
and unfailing fidelity to truth and honor. The slightest in- 
consistency or evasion on their part, the slightest concession 
to the lust of victory without merit, the slightest relaxation 
of vigilance or interest, even the complacent smile that some- 
times accompanies the formal rebuke of victorious trickery 
may lower the whole standard of athletic honor. It must be 
remembered, too, that no institution can long maintain one 
standard of honor for the athletic field and another for the 
recitation room. Both student and public are quick to make 
their inferences, and these inferences, even if unfair, become 
in turn almost as prejudicial to the maintenance of student 
honor as are overt acts of dishonor. 
’ I am convinced, however, that in many instances of sup- 
posed underhandedness in college athletics the case is one of 
pervertzd vision rather than of moral obliquity. We need 
constant‘¥ to remember that many things which to the faculty 
and to outsiders appear palpably dishonorable are not so 
regarded bythe student, because he is in the grip of a collect- 
ive athletic sentiment of which others know but little. He is 
in need of enlightenment rather than of censure. He is a 
reminder that athletic tactics have not been adequately inter- 
preted to college students in simple terms of right and wrong. 
The strategy, for example, by which a pitcher leads a runner 
on the bases to overestimate his chances “to get away,” is 
perfectly legitimate; but the strategy employed by the catcher 
who habitually pulls the ball down as he catches it, and thus 
leads the umpire to call a strike, is dishonest. The principle 
is perfectly clear: to practice deception on the umpire is to 
practice imposition on the. opposing team. But how many 
students ever pause to make the distinction, and how often 
has it been made to them? 
Mr. Briggs narrates the following case:! “A whole-souled 
and straightforward young athlete told me once, with smiling 
good humor, that a football player in his own college (who 
had everybody’s respect) owed his success in the game to a 
knack of holding his opponent in such a manner as made his 
1 School, College, and Character, page 75. [Author’s note.] 
 
-P-A-G-E-438
  416 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
opponent seem to hold him.” Does not the very frankness of 
the young man in making this disclosure to the dean show 
that he saw nothing dishonorable in it? His sénse of honor 
was not involved because his intelligence had not been appealed 
to. So far from purposely affronting faculty sentiment, he 
was ignorant of it. “ 
Another case in point is found in the most important decla- 
ration made by the well-known Conference on Intercollegiate 
Athletics held at Brown University, February 18, 1898. The 
declaration reads: ‘The practice of assisting young mén through 
college in order that they may strengthen the athletic teams 
is degrading to amateur sport.” This declaration, I repeat, 
is all-important; but it needs explanation to the prospective 
matriculate. It does not commend itself to his sense of fair- 
ness or of consistency. He is more likely to see in the offense 
inhibited, so far as it regards himself, not a malum in se, but 
only a malum prohibitum. He knows that the practice of 
assisting worthy young men through college that they may 
strengthen some mysical organization, or serve as typesetters 
in the office of the college paper, is perfectly legitimate. “Why 
may not I,” he asks, “pay in part for my education by my 
physical prowess, if my brother pays in part for his education 
by his musical talent?” The question is a natural one and 
should be answered béfore it is asked. Left unanswered, it 
tempts the student to evasion and duplicity. 
z+ One other illustration of the obscurity that should not exist 
“jn matters affecting student conduct relates not to athletics, 
but to examinations, an illustration that may serve also to 
introduce the subject of the honor system. In an article en- 
titled “Student honor: a study in cheating,” ! Mr. Earl Barnes 
writes as follows: “Not long since there was a flagrant case 
of cheating discovered in one of our large universities. An 
examination paper had been stolen from a printing office and 
several students had used it to secure superior standing. An 
attempt was made to arouse public sentiment in the institu- 
1 See the International Journal of Ethics, Volume 14, page 481 (1903-1904). [Author's note.] 
 
-P-A-G-E-439
  
COMMUNITY LIFE OF THE COLLEGE 417 
tion; and the student body appointed a committee from its 
numbers which was to receive reports and try future offenders.” 
While the niatter was under discussion, three professors in 
different and representative departments asked their students 
to state in writing whether they would themselves, had they 
become cognizant of the theft, have reported it to the student 
committee, it’ being taken for granted that they would not 
report to the faculty. The majority of the students, men and 
women, said “No.” The author concludes: “And so we must 
be patierft with children, and university students, and with 
ourselves until] we grow up to social manhood and woman- 
hood,” | i 
The position of the author seems to me not well taken. 
Something ought to have been done, but all the world despises 
a tattler. Some of the students wrote: “I despise the spirit 
that actuates a talebearer. How can a person. respect himself 
and be a talebearer?”’ Others said that “even the faculty pro- 
fessors would secretly despise them, and the public would con- 
sider them contemptible informers.” Was there no other 
exit except through tattling? My own feeling is that a stu- 
dent who has witnessed the theft would, under the circum- 
stances, have done his full duty had he gone to the ring-leaders 
,_ and expressed to them his own sense of indignation and wrong, 
adding no threat of possible exposure. But if the student 
committee had been an established agency of the institution, 
and not called into being solely by this emergency,—in other 
words, if the honor system had prevailed in the institution,— 
reporting to the committee would not have been tattling, nor 
would it have been so regarded by the students themselves. 
If an institution uniformly ignores the student’s sense of Honor 
on examinations, is it to be expected that this same sense of 
honor can be confidently appealed to when an emergency 
arises, an emergency due to the almost inexcusable carelessness 
of a member of the faculty? 
The honor system as it prevails in Southern colleges and 
universities to-day is itself an evolution. Inaugurated by  
-P-A-G-E-440
  418 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
Thomas Jefferson in the founding of the University of Vir- 
ginia in 1825,' it was not until 1842 that the system may be 
said to have culminated in the following resolution: 
“Resolved. That in all future written examinations for 
distinction or other honors of the University, each candidate 
shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such 
examination a certificate in the following words: I, A. B., do 
hereby certify on honor that I have derived no assistance 
during the time of this examination from any source whatever, 
whether oral or written, or in print, in giving the above 
answers.” ? 
The pledge is now simplified into “I certify upon my Hane 
that I have neither given nor received aid on this examination,” 
and is used in this form, or with unimportant modifications, 
in all Southern colleges and universities. The professor re- 
mains in the room during the examination to preserve quiet 
and to answer necessary questions, but there is no suggestion 
of espionage. The student is presumed to be a gentleman, 
and this trust in his honor is a powerful influence in making 
him honorable. It at least shields him against the subtle 
temptation to act on the principle that where there is no con- 
fidence, deceit is no crime. Violations of the written pledge, 
are rare and are usually dealt with by the students themselves, © 
sometimes by the faculty alone, not infrequently by both. 
That the honor system prevails only to a limited extent out- _ 
side of the South is no indication that student nature is essen- 
tially different in different sections. I have yet to hear of any 
college or university where the honor system, if faithfully 
tried, has proved a failure. “I have yet to meet a single 
1 It is possible that the honor system may have been in vogue in a few Southern colleges 
before 1825. The claim of precedence is often made for the South Carolina College. Presi- 
dent Benjamin Sloan writes, however, as follows (May 27, 190s): “I am very sorry that i 
can find no record of the origin of the honor system in South Carolina College. It seems, 
though, that this principle was adopted at the birth of the college, for one of the by-laws 
published in 1804 states ‘that rewards and punishments shall be addressed to a sense of duty, 
and the principle of honor and shame.’ I can find no further documentary evidence of the 
adoption of the honor system by the Board of Trustees.” [Author’s note.]

man,” says Mr. Briggs,’ “who has lived under the honor sys- 
tem (as I have not) who does not give it, in spite, perhaps, of 
a priori scepticism, his absolute faith.” 
Mr. Briggs is not, however, a believer in the honor system 
for two reasons. “Theoretically,” says he,” “though in a doubt- 
ful case I should always accept the word of a suspected student, 
I object to the honor system as nursing a false kind of sensi- 
tiveness that resents a kind of supervision which everybody 
must sooner or later accept, and as taking from the degree some 
part of its sanction.” The same objections reappear in a 
letter recently received (June 3) from Mr. Jerome D. Greene 
of Harvard University, secretary to President Eliot: “The honor 
system, so-called, does not obtain at Harvard. With us all 
examinations are held under the supervision of a college officer, 
either an instructor in the course, or a proctor appointed and 
paid for such services. Such supervision is valued by honor- 
able students as a guarantee of the good faith of an examination, 
—a guarantee which is absent from a diploma based on examina- 
tions which are not supervised. An honest student has no 
more objection to this method of vouching for the honesty of 
his examination than a bank official has to having his accounts 
»y audited.” 
It is not my purpose to take up the cudgels for the honor 
system, but to remove what seem to be the two prevalent mis- 
conceptions of the system as compared with the so-called sys- 
tem of supervision. In the first place, Mr. Greene’s conten- 
tion that the honest student has no objection to this method 
of vouching for the honesty of his examination may be con- 
ceded at once. No one would maintain that the students of 
an institution accustomed to no other system would resent 
ithe system of supervision. But how do the two systems pre- 
pare for life? If the one system prepares the student for “a 
kind of supervision which everybody must sooner or later 
,accept,” does not the other system prepare the student for a 
kind of personal accountability which, unfortunately, every- 
body does not sooner or later accept?

-P-A-G-E-442
420 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
In the second place, is it true that a diploma based on exam- 
inations conducted under the honor system is less trustworthy 
than one based on supervised examinations? Granting that 
there is undetected cheating under both systems, is there more 
under the honor system? Having known only the honor sys- 
tem myself, let me cite, out of much available material, the 
testimony of three teachers who have tried both systems. “If 
any instructor,” says Professor William H. Hulme,! of the 
College for Women, Western Reserve University, “even with 
the help of two or three assistant ‘proctors,’ supposes he can 
prevent cheating or cribbing in a room of fifty or more college 
boys by seating them in any possible order, he certainly does 
not understand human nature and he is entirely mistaken. An 
inquiry among a half-dozen of his best students will convince 
him that cheating goes on regularly right under his eyes. It 
is, in fact, the boast of many students in colleges where they 
are watched on examinations, that they cheat and crib at 
every opportunity, and they feel that they have a perfect right 
to do so because they are being watched and are therefore 
suspected.” 
Dr. G. Carl Huber, of the University of Michigan, writes as 
follows (May 18, 1905): “In view of the fact that the so- 
called honor system has been tried only in the department of 
medicine and surgery of the University of Michigan, Presi- 
dent Angell has forwarded your communication to him, of 
recent date, to me for answer. I may state that some four 
“ years ago, largely through the instigation of our present grad- 
uating class, a set of resolutions were adopted by the class and 
approved by the faculty, according to which the class, and 
especially an appointed committee of the class, which also was 
approved by the faculty, were to have charge of all examina- 
tions, written quizzes, and ‘all written exercises in which this 
class would participate during its stay in the University. The 
class adopted a very good set of resolutions and have been 
enthusiastic in carrying out the spirit and the letter of these 
resolutions. As concerns this one class, the honor system has

        COMMUNITY LIFE OF THE COLLEGE 421 
proven very satisfactory. It has elevated the tone of the class, 
and its conduct has been much more loyal through its entire 
stay at the University.” 
“The honor system,” writes Dean H. B. Fine of Princeton 
University (May 25, 1905), “I may say has proved an un- 
qualified success here in Princeton. It has banished cheating 
from our examinations, and before the system was introduced 
there was a great deal of cheating in the Princeton examina- 
tions. Once in a while, to be sure, a student so far forgets 
himself and his honor as to cheat, but he is pretty certain to 
be detected, and if so, his dismissal from college on the recom- 
mendation of the student honor committee follows almost as a 
matter of course.” ; 
In conclusion, there is no room for pessimism, for there 
was never a time when the relations existing between college 
faculties and college students were more frank and cordial 
than they are to-day. There was never a time when the per- 
sonal influence of college professors was more potential for the 
direction and ennoblement of student life. If the honor ideals 
of the students find in their instructors prompt recognition, 
kindly enlightenment, and hearty codperation, both students 
and instructors will be alike the beneficiaries. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. Compare the advantages and the disadvantages of the honor 
system and show which you prefer to work under,—it or the opposed 
scheme. 2. If the honor system is in vogue in your institution, 
discuss whether it is successful. 3. Familiarize yourself with the 
modus operandi of the honor system at your own institution or some 
other, and describe its operation. 4. By means of further illustra- 
tions, show the difference between legitimate strategy and dishonesty 
in athletic contests. 5. Indicate other instances where a curious 
double standard prevails in college ethics. Is this something dis- 
tinctive of college life or may the same thing be found obtaining in 
business and social life? 6. Argue for or against the view, sometimes 
current among students, that the honor system is a college-mode 
idea which will not prevail in after life where aids are allowed in pro- 
fessions and that therefore the student did not always consider him-

self culpable when receiving such aid in examinations. 7. Consider 
the relation of the honor system to the student practice of bluffing it 
out on recitation rather than telling the instructor he is unprepared 
for recitation when called upon to recite. 8. Should the honor system 
be extended to gambling, drunkenness, and like matters? 
TRUTH OF INTERCOURSE! 
Rosert Louis STEVENSON 
[Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894), the Scotch novelist and essayist, 
was a most interesting character alike in his life and writings. He was in- 
tended for the engineering profession, but early developed symptoms of 
consumption, and his life became thenceforward one long struggle bravely 
borne against pain and disease. Under these circumstances he went back 
to his first love, literature. During his comparatively brief life, Stevenson 
wrote—besides a number of sketches, plays, and poems,—half a dozen long 
romantic novels, some short stories, and two or three volumes of personal 
and critical essays. His personal essays, of which the following selection 
is a representative, are charming confidential talks from one who, besides 
having a charming personality, possessed a mind steeped in great literature, 
and along with it all a lively fancy. In his writing Stevenson worked hard 
to perfect his style, with the result that he finally wrought out a clear, well- 
modulated form of expression which is the admiration of critics and the 
joy of cultivated readers.] 
Among sayings that have a currency in spite of being wholly 
false upon the face of them for the sake of a half-truth upon 
another subject which is accidentally combined with the error, 
one of the grossest and broadest conveys the monstrous proposi- 
tion that it is easy to tell the truth and hard to tell a lie. I wish 
heartily it were. But the truth is one; it has first to be dis- 
covered, then justly and exactly uttered. Even with instru- 
ments specially contrived for such a purpose—with a foot 
tule, a level, or a theodolite—it is not easy to be exact; it is 
easier, alas! to be inexact. From those who mark the divisions 
on a scale to those who measure the boundaries of empires or 
the distance of the heavenly stars, it is by careful method and 
minute, unwearying attention that men rise even to material

exactness or to sure knowledge even of external and constant 
things. But it is easier to draw the outline of a mountain 
than the changing appearance of a face; and truth in human 
relations is of this more intangible and dubious order: hard to 
seize, harder to communicate. Veracity to facts in a loose, 
colloquial sense—not to say that I have been in Malabar when 
as a matter of fact I was never out of England, not to say that 
I have read Cervantes in the original when as a matter of fact 
I know not one syllable of Spanish—this, indeed, is easy and 
to the same degree unimportant in itself. Lies of this sort, 
according to circumstances, may or may not be important; 
in a certain sense even they may or may not be false. The 
habitual liar may be a very honest fellow, and live truly with 
his wife and friends; while another man who never told a formal 
falsehood in his life may yet be himself one lie—heart and face, 
from top to bottom. This is the kind of lie which poisons 
intimacy. And, vice versa, veracity to sentiment, truth in a 
relation, truth to your own heart and your friends, never to 
feign or falsify emotion—that is the truth which makes love 
possible and mankind happy. 
Lart de bien dire’ is but a drawing-room accomplishment 
unless it be pressed into the service of the truth. The difficulty 
of literature is not to write, but to write what you mean; not 
to affect your reader, but to affect him precisely as you wish. 
This is commonly understood in the case of books or set orations; 
even in making your will, or writing an explicit letter, some diffi- 
culty is admitted by the world. But one thing you can never 
make Philistine natures understand; one thing, which yet lies 
on the surface, remains as unseizable to their wits as a high 
flight of metaphysics—namely, that the business of life is mainly 
carried on by means of this difficult art of literature, and 
according to a man’s proficiency in that art shall be the freedom 
and the fullness of his intercourse with other men. Anybody, 
it is supposed, can say what he means; and, in spite of their 
notorious experience to the contrary, people so continue to 
suppose. Now, I simply open the last book I have been reading 
‘The art of fine speaking.

* —Mr. Leland’s captivating “English Gipsies.” “It is said,” 
I find on page 7, “that those who can converse with Irish 
peasants in their own native tongue form far higher opinions 
of their appreciation of the beautiful, and of the elements of 
humor and pathos in their hearts, than do those who know their 
thoughts only through the medium of English. I know from 
my own observations that this is quite the case with the Indians 
of North America, and it is unquestionably so with the gipsy.” 
In short, where a man has not a full possession of the language, 
the most important, because the most amiable, qualities of his 
nature have to lie buried and fallow; for the pleasure of com- 
radeship, and the intellectual part of love, rest upon these very 
“elements of humor and pathos.” Here is a man opulent in 
both, and for lack of a medium he can put none of it out to 
interest in the market of affection! But what is thus made 
plain to our apprehensions in the case of a foreign language is 
partially true even with the tongue we learned in childhood. 
Indeed, we all speak different dialects; one shall be copious 
and exact, another loose and meager; but the speech of the 
ideal talker shall correspond and fit upon the truth of fact—not 
clumsily, obscuring lineaments, like a mantle, but cleanly 
adhering, like an athlete’s skin. And what is the result? 
That the one can open himself more clearly to his friends, 
and can enjoy more of what makes life truly valuable—inti- 
macy with those he loves. An orator makes a falze step; he 
employs some trivial, some absurd, some vulgar phrase; in the 
turn of a sentence he insults, by a side wind, those whom he 
is laboring to charm; in speaking to one sentiment he un- 
consciously ruffles another in parenthesis; and you are not 
surprised, for you know his task to be delicate and filled with 
perils. “O frivolous mind of man, light ignorance!” As if 
yourself, when you seek to explain some misunderstanding or 
excuse some apparent fault, speaking swiftly and addressing 
a mind still recently incensed, were not harnessing for a more 
perilous adventure; as if yourself required less tact and elo- 
quence; as if an angry friend or a suspicious lover were not more 
easy to offend than a meeting of indifferent politicians! Nay,
-P-A-G-E-447

and the orator treads in a beaten round; the matters he discusses 
have been discussed a thousand times before; language is ready- 
shaped to his purpose; he speaks out of a cut and dry vocab- 
ulary. But you—may it not be that your defense reposes on 
some subtlety of feeling, not so much as touched upon in Shakes- 
peare, to express which, like a pioneer, you must venture forth 
into zones of thought still unsurveyed, and become yourself a 
literary innovator? For even in love there are unlovely humors; 
ambiguous acts, unpardonable words, may yet have sprung 
from a kind sentiment. If the injured one could read your 
heart, you may be sure that he would understand and pardon; 
but, alas! the heart cannot be shown—it has to be demonstrated 
in words. Do you think it is a hard thing to write poetry? 
Why, that is to write poetry, and of a high, if not the highest, 
order. 
I should even more admire “the lifelong and heroic literary 
labors” of my fellow-men, patiently clearing up in words their 
loves and their contentions, and speaking their autobiography 
daily to their wives, were it not for a circumstance which 
lessens their difficulty and my admiration by equal parts, 
for life, though largely, is not entirely carried on by literature. 
We are subject to physical passions and contortions; the 
voice breaks and changes, and speaks by unconscious and 
winning inflections; we have legible countenances, like an open 
book; things that cannot be said look eloquently through the 
eyes; and the soul, not locked into the body as a dungeon, 
dwells ever on the threshold with appealing signals. Groans 
and tears, looks and gestures, a flush or a paleness, are often the 
most clear reporters of the heart, and speak more directly to 
the hearts of others. The message flies by these interpreters 
in the least space of time, and the misunderstanding is averted 
in the moment of its birth. To explain in words takes time and 
a just and patient hearing; and in the critical epochs of a close 
relation, patience and justice are not qualities on which we can 
rely. But the look or the gesture explains things in a breath; 
they tell their message without ambiguity; unlike speech, 
they cannot stumble, by the way, on a reproach or an illusion
-P-A-G-E-448
426 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
that should steel your friend against the truth; and then they 
have a higher authority, for they are the direct expression 
of the heart, not yet transmitted through the unfaithful and 
sophisticating brain. Not long ago I wrote a letter to a friend 
which came near involving us in quarrel; but we met, and in 
personal talk I repeated the worst of what I had written, and 
added worse to that; and with the commentary of the body 
it seemed not unfriendly either to hear or say. Indeed, letters 
are in vain for the purposes of intimacy; an absence is a dead 
break in the relation; yet two who know each other fully and 
are bent on perpetuity in love, may so preserve the attitude of 
their affections that they may meet on the same terms as they 
had parted. 
Pitiful is the case of the blind, who cannot read the face; 
pitiful that of the deaf, who cannot follow the changes of the 
voice. And there are others also to be pitied; for there are 
some of an inert, uneloquent nature, who have been denied all 
the symbols of communication, who have neither a lively play 
of facial expression, nor speaking gestures, nor a responsive 
voice, nor yet the gift of frank, explanatory speech: people truly 
made of clay, people tied for life into a bag which no one can 
undo. They are poorer than the gipsy, for their heart can 
speak no language under heaven. Such people we must learn 
slowly by the tenor of their acts, or through yea and nay com- 
munications; or we take them on trust on the strength of a 
general air, and now and again, when we see the spirit breaking 
through in a flash, correct or change our estimate. But these 
will be uphill intimacies, without charm or freedom, to the end; 
and freedom is the chief ingredient in confidence. Some minds, 
romantically dull, despise physical endowments. That is a 
doctrine for a misanthrope; to those who like their fellow- 
creatures it must always be meaningless; and, for my part, I 
can see few things more desirable, after the possession of such 
radical qualities as honor and humor and pathos, than to have 
a lively and not a stolid countenance; to have looks to corre- 
spond with every feeling; to be elegant and delightful in person, 
so that we shall please even in the intervals of active pleasing,
-P-A-G-E-449

and may never discredit speech with uncouth manners or be- 
come unconsciously our own burlesques. But of all unfor- 
tunates there is one creature (for I will not call him man) con- 
spicuous in misfortune. This is he who has forfeited his birth- 
right of expression, who has cultivated artful intonations, who 
has taught his face tricks, like a pet monkey, and on every side 
perverted or cut off his means of communication with his 
fellow-men. The body is a house of many windows: there 
we all sit, showing ourselves and crying on the passers-by to 
come and love us. But this fellow has filled his windows with 
opaque glass, elegantly colored. His house may be admired 
for its design, the crowd may pause before the stained windows, 
but meanwhile the poor proprietor must lie languishing within, 
uncomforted, unchangeably alone. 
Truth of intercourse is something more difficult than to 
refrain from open lies. It is possible to avoid falsehood and 
yet not tell the truth. It is not enough to answer formal 
questions. To reach the truth by yea and nay communica- 
tions implies a questioner with a share of inspiration, such as 
is often found in mutual love. Yea and may mean nothing; 
the meaning must have been related in the question. Many 
words are often necessary to convey a very simple statement; 
for in this sort of exercise we never hit the gold; the most that 
we can hope is by many arrows, more or less far off on different 
sides, to indicate, in the course of time, for what target we are 
aiming, and after an hour’s talk, back and forward, to con- 
vey the purport of a single principle or a single thought. And 
yet while the curt, pithy speaker misses the point entirely, a 
wordy, prolegomenous babbler will often add three new offenses 
in the process of excusing one. It is really a most delicate 
affair. The world was made before the English language, and 
seemingly upon a different design. Suppose we held our 
converse not in words, but in music; those who have a bad ear 
would find themselves cut off from all near commerce, and no 
better than foreigners in this big world. But we do not con- 
sider how many have “a bad ear” for words, nor how often the 
most eloquent find nothing to reply. I hate questioners and 
 
-P-A-G-E-450
428 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
questions; there are so few that can be spoken to without a 
lie. “Do you forgive me?” Madam and sweetheart, so far as 
I have gone in life I have never yet been able to discover what 
forgiveness means. “Is it still the same between us?” Why, 
how can it be? It is eternally different; and yet you are still 
the friend of my heart. “Do you understand me?” God knows; 
I should think it highly improbable. 
The cruelest lies are often told in silence. A man may 
have sat in a room for hours and not opened his teeth, and yet 
come out of that room a disloyal friend or a vile calumniator. 
And how many loves have perished because, from pride, or 
spite, or diffidence, or that unmanly shame which withholds a 
man from daring to betray emotion, a lover, at the critical 
point of the relation, has but hung his head and held his tongue? 
And, again, a lie may be told by a truth, or a truth conveyed 
through a lie. Truth to facts is not always truth to sentiment 
and part of the truth, as often happens in answer to a question, 
may be the foulest calumny. A fact may be an exception; 
but the feeling is the law, and it is that which you must neither 
garble nor belie. The whole tenor of a conversation is a part 
of the meaning of each separate statement; the beginning and 
the end define and travesty the intermediate conversation. 
You never speak to God; you address a fellow-man, full of his 
own tempers; and to tell truth, rightly understood, is not to 
state the true facts, but to convey a true impression; truth in 
spirit, not truth to letter, is the true veracity. To reconcile 
averted friends a Jesuitical discretion is often needful, not so 
much to gain a kind hearing as to communicate sober truth. 
Women have an ill name in this connection; yet they live in as 
true relations; the lie of a good woman is the true index of 
her heart. 
“Tt takes,” says Thoreau, in the noblest and most useful 
passage I remember to have read in any modern author,' “two 
to speak truth—one to speak and another to hear.’ He must 
be very little experienced, or have no great zeal for truth, who 
does not recognize the fact. A grain of anger or a grain of

suspicion produces strange acoustical effects, and makes the 
ear greedy to remark offense. Hence we find those who have 
once quarreled carry themselves distantly, and are ever ready 
to break the truce. To speak truth there must be moral equality 
or else no respect; and hence between parent and child inter- 
course is apt to degenerate into a verbal fencing bout, and mis- 
apprehensions to become ingrained. And there is another 
side to this, for the parent begins with an imperfect notion of 
the child’s character, formed in early years or during the equi- 
noctial gales of youth; to this he adheres, noting only the facts 
which suit with his preconception; and wherever a person 
fancies himself unjustly judged, he at once and finally gives up 
the effort to speak truth. With our chosen friends, on the 
other hand, and still more between lovers (for mutual under- 
standing is love’s essence), the truth is easily indicated by the 
one and aptly comprehended by the other. A hint taken, a 
look understood, conveys the gist of long and delicate explana- 
tions; and where the life is known even yea and nay become 
luminous. In the closest of all relations—that of a love well 
founded and equally shared—speech is half discarded, like a 
roundabout, infantile process or a ceremony of formal etiquette; 
and the two communicate directly by their presences, and with 
few looks and fewer words contrive to share their good and 
evil and uphold each other’s hearts in joy. For love rests upon 
a physical basis; it is a familiarity of nature’s making and 
apart from voluntary choice. Understanding has in some sort 
outrun knowledge, for the affection perhaps began with the 
acquaintance; and as it was not made like other relations, so it is 
not, like them, to be perturbed or clouded. Each knows more 
than can be uttered; each lives by faith, and believes by a 
natural compulsion; and between man and wife the language 
of the body is largely developed and grown strangely eloquent. 
The thought that prompted and was conveyed in a caress 
would only lose to be set down in words—ay, although Shakes- 
peare himself should be the scribe. 
Yet it is in these dear intimacies, beyond all others, that we 
must strive and do battle for the truth.* Let but a doubt arise, 
 
-P-A-G-E-452

and alas! all the previous intimacy and confidence is but an- 
other charge against the person doubted. “What a monstrous 
dishonesty is this if I have been deceived so long and so com- 
pletely!” Let but that thought gain entrance, and you plead 
before a deaf tribunal. Appeal to the past; why, that is your 
crime! Make all clear, convince the reason; alas! speciousness 
is but a proof against you. “If you can abuse me now, the more 
likely that you have abused me from the first.” 
For a strong affection such moments are worth supporting, 
and they will end well; for your advocate is in your lover’s 
heart, and speaks her own language; it is not you but she her- 
self who can defend and clear you of the charge. But in 
slighter intimacies, and for a less stringent union? Indeed, is 
it worth while? We are all incompris, only more or less con- 
cerned for the mischance; all trying wrongly to do right; all 
fawning at each other’s feet like dumb, neglected lap-dogs. 
Sometimes we catch an eye—this is our opportunity in the ages 
—and we wag our tail with a poor smile. “Js that all?” All? 
If you only knew! But how can they know? They do not 
love us; the more fools we to squander life on the indifferent. 
But the morality of the thing, you will be glad to hear, is 
excellent; for it is only by trying to understand others that we 
can get our own hearts understood; and in matters of human 
feeling the clement judge is the most successful pleader. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. Why is it difficult to obtain truth of intercourse? 2. Some one 
has said, “To speak the truth is to say what you think.” Is this an 
adequate definition? If not, give a better or more complete one. 
3. Name all the motives you can think of which lead people to false- 
hood in speech and in action. Are any of these motives as important 
as truthfulness? 4. Discuss the truth of Stevenson’s statement on 
page 428: “The cruelest lies are often told in silence. A man may 
have sat for hours and not opened his teeth and yet come out of that 
room a disloyal friend and a vile calumniator.” Illustrate your 
discussion by examples. 5. ‘A lie is the abandonment of the dignity 
of man,” Kant, the German philosopher, has said. Show why this 
is so. 6. Apply Stevenson’s view of the poverty of the resources of 
language to the work of the composition writer.

ON RESPONSIBILITY ! 
Joun Grier HisBen 
[John Grier Hibben (1861 -) has been since 1913 president of Princeton 
University. For a number of years he was professor in the philosophical 
department of Princeton.]   
There is much loose and confused thinking about the nature 
of reponsibility. Not only are there innumerable instances 
of persons holding positions of trust who are evading evident 
responsibilities, but also of those who would seek to justify 
themselves in such a course. The latter are like the figures in 
Nast’s famous cartoon of the Tweed Ring, who are all standing 
in a circle, and each one pointing aside with his thumb to his 
neighbor as the responsible person. It is the old story of the 
other man. There are many circumstances in life where it is 
convenient to shift the responsibility upon some one else; and 
whenever one sets himself to defend a convenient course of 
action, he cannot always see straight and think clear. Even 
though he may succeed in convincing himself, nevertheless if 
in this process there is any element of self-deception, he is 
perilously near the danger line. 
There are no fallacies so subtle as those which insinuate 
themselves into our reasonings at a time when our interests 
are involved. Therefore when we seek to free ourselves of the 
burden of responsibility in any situation, we must be peculiarly 
on guard, that we do not allow ourselves to become ensnared 
in the toils of those artificial distinctions and plausible explana- 
tions, which when stripped of their verbal dress appear in their 
nakedness as contemptible subterfuges. 
One of these convenient ideas which serve as a kind of natural 
anesthetic to conscience is the belief that any responsibility 
which is divided is thereby lessened. The director of a cor- 
poration may content himself with the comforting thought that 
where many are jointly responsible, his share of the common 
obligation after all cannot be regarded as very serious. And 
1 Reprinted from Scribner's Magasine, Volume 47, page 498 (April, 1910),   
 
-P-A-G-E-454
    
432 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
it is in this idea that a very fundamental error lies. For re- 
sponsibility is by its nature something intensive and not ex- 
tensive. It can be divided among many, but it is not thereby 
diminished in degree. On the other hand, when by the ordinary 
processes of arithmetical division one number is divided by 
another, the result is only a small part of the original amount. 
It is always a lessening process. But the idea of responsibility 
cannot be expressed in any such quantitative terms. Dividends 
can be divided into separate parts, but responsibility cannot. 
Responsibility can never be conceived in the light of a magni- 
tude. It belongs to the class of things which, when divided, 
each part is equal to the whole. 
Responsibility in this respect is like pleasure which, when 
shared, is not lessened, but the rather increased, as Bacon long 
ago pointed out. The same quality we find in the rewards of 
honor, or of fame it may be, which come to the many who 
have served in a common cause and rejoice in a common vic- 
tory. Thus the glory of the whole is each one’s share. It can 
be divided among many without loss. So, also, the appreciation 
of beauty in nature or in art shows no diminishing returns, 
although the number who experience the joy of it may be in- 
creased without limit. This, also, is the characteristic feature 
of responsibility. Parents share the responsibility of their 
child, but the complete responsibility and no half measure of 
it rests upon each. The director of a bank or an insurance com- 
pany shares the responsibility of his position with his colleagues 
on the same board; but the shared responsibility is not a per 
capitum portion, but the whole. 
This is not a new doctrine; it comes to us with an immemorial 
sanction. But it seems to have been forgotten in recent years. 
“My share of the responsibility is but slight,” is a common 
phrase which may be heard on all sides at the present day. 
If one would thus seek to minimize his sense of obligation as 
regards that which may be placed in his keeping as a trust, 
he should not forget that his share of responsibility is not a part, 
but the whole, undiminished and untransferable. He may 
have others associated with him, it is true, but his individual 
 
-P-A-G-E-455
   COMMUNITY LIFE OF THE COLLEGE 433 
responsibility cannot be shifted upon them. He must meet 
it in the full rigor of its demands, and regard himself as though 
alone in the discharge of his duties. 
There is also the fallacy of the delegated responsibility. It is 
impossible for one at the head. of large business interests, for 
instance, to give his personal attention to every minute detail. 
He finds himself naturally compelled to delegate much of the 
work of supervision and of administration to others who act 
in the capacity of his deputies. Otherwise the business of 
life would be impossible. This is indeed a commonplace of 
every-day business routine. But because some one else may 
assume the responsibility, he is not wholly relieved of it. He 
passes on the duty of actually performing some specific work, 
and yet the obligation still rests with him not to do the task, 
it is true, but at least to see that it is done. We cannot afford 
to ignore the customary judgment that the act of the agent 
is the act of the principal. We cannot take it for granted that 
the mere transfer of responsibility to another assures a satis- 
factory discharge of ‘all the duties which it involves. We do 
not dare to shut our eyes to the fact as to whether such duties 
are fulfilled or not, on the ground that the responsibility now 
rests upon another and not upon ourselves. It is his responsi- 
bility, but it is also ours. A person who is at the head of a large 
business enterprise cannot be omnipresent or omniscient; but 
he is responsible for the kind of men who are his partners in 
responsibility, and also for the atmosphere which pervades 
his business, for the general morale of the service, for the disci- 
pline that is enforced, for the prevailing policy and method pur- 
sued, and for the spirit and tone which characterize all depart- 
ments, however various they may be. Division of labor is not 
a dissipation of responsibility. He who is responsible for a 
particular task is relieved of that responsibility only when 
there is evidence that the given work has been done. The 
head of a corporation should devise certain methods by which 
such evidence can be regularly forthcoming, so that when any 
cog in any wheel may chance to slip, the fact may be at once 
apparent at the central seat of responsibility.     
       
   
                   
      
-P-A-G-E-456
  434 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
There is, of course, such a thing as a serial responsibility, as 
I would style it, that is, where a number of persons in turn 
assume the responsibility for a certain task, each contributing 
his share to its accomplishment, and then pass on the full re- 
sponsibility to some other. This is illustrated in the sending 
of a registered package. Each one in the series does his part 
in the process of forwarding it, and receives a signed acknowl- 
edgment that another has relieved him of his particular duty 
and of all responsibility connected with it. The ordinary 
business of life, however, cannot always be so nicely adjusted. 
Responsibility appears more often in an indefinite and diffused 
form, in which many persons are involved, and no one at any 
time carries the full burden alone. There is no way of escaping 
responsibility of this kind as long as we remain within the area 
of its pervading power. We dare not hang about the outer 
edge of this region, hoping to reap the possible rewards, and 
yet think to evade all blame or loss in the event of untoward 
results.. There are many who thus endeavor to hold their course 
along some such imaginary line, so that they may shrewdly 
keep within it to share the honor or dividends which may accrue, 
and yet be able to swerve to the other side of it whenever the 
area within may become the storm center of indignant protest 
and recrimination. 
There is another fallacy which many fall into of securing 
freedom from responsibility by the assumption of a convenient 
ignorance. A candidate, for instance, may not choose to know 
the detail of method and of policy pursued by a campaign com- 
mittee in charge of his interests. The members of the com- 
mittee in turn deem it wise to have him kept in ignorance. It 
is generally understood that whatever happens, he is to know 
nothing about it. The comforting theory is that no responsi- 
bility can attach to a person concerning an act of which he is 
ignorant. This is doubtless true, provided he is not purposely 
ignorant. A person may not be held responsible for failure 
to see some obvious circumstance when his eyes are shut; but 
he is responsible for his eyes being shut when they ought to be 
cpen,

There are men who know that certain results could not possi- 
bly be accomplished without certain definite means being used; 
and yet consent weakly to profit by these results on the ground 
that they do not know explicitly the character of the means 
used to attain them. It is a lame excuse. We are responsible 
not only for that which we see and hear, but also for that which 
may be implied in the things seen and heard, and which we are 
compelled to recognize as the necessary consequence of them. 
It is not merely the actual situation in which we find ourselves, 
but also the logic of such situation that must be interpreted 
and judged by us as to the measure of our responsibility for 
them. It must be remembered that the very ground of our 
responsibility is the presupposition that we are in complete 
possession of our reason. How absurd therefore to narrow the 
range of responsibility by excluding the obvious inferences which 
the reason of any man of ordinary intelligence must surely 
recognize. If a campaign committee, for instance, expends 
large sums of money, it stands to reason that the one in whose 
interests it has been raised must know that revenues are not 
created by magic. Merely to choose not to know, is to ignore a 
definite responsibility and thereby assume an indefinite one. 
It is like signing a blank check to an unknown order for an un- 
known amount. The man who would rather not know what 
his friends are doing in his behalf should be held to strict account 
for his voluntary ignorance. No one can afford to have things 
done for him which he would scorn to do or be afraid to do him- 
self. 
There is also a very common feeling that any one can re- 
pudiate all responsibility in a given situation, if he will only 
declare forcibly and loudly enough that he does not regard him- 
self as in the least responsible for the same. He may insist that 
he will wash his hands of the whole matter; but there are certain 
stains that cannot be thus removed. The hands may be washed; 
but they may not be made clean by the process. How often 
do men justify themselves when feebly yielding to the prevailing 
opinion of the many associated with them in some position of 
trust, by the ready excuse, that after all the majority must rule. 
 
-P-A-G-E-458
  436 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
It is true that the majority must rule; but it is equally true that 
the minority must often fight. A mere verbal protest followed 
by a quiet acquiescence is not sufficient when honor or honesty 
is the issue. An uncompromising attitude of opposition may 
have to be maintained until the court of last appeal is reached; 
that court may be a board of directors, or the stockholders, or 
public opinion, or in the regular course of legal procedure even 
the Supreme Court of the United States itself. Responsibility 
often means a fight to the finish. 
We are responsible for our silence, for our inertia, for our 
ignorance, for our indifference—in short for all those negative 
qualities which commonly constitute the “dummy” directors, 
—those inconsequent personages who would enjoy the honor 
and the perquisites of their office without allowing themselves 
to be unduly burdened with its duties and cares. The president 
of a corporation or a superintendent does not assume the re- 
sponsibility vested in its board of directors; he merely represents 
that responsibility. And when they would implicitly assign all 
sense of their personal obligations to his keeping, they not only 
put themselves in a position to be easily fooled, but actually 
offer a ready temptation to such an one to fool them. ‘They are 
thus doubly reprehensible; for the neglect of duty on the one 
hand and on the other for actually extending a virtual invitation 
for some one to use them as tools for unlawful ends. Not only 
the wreck of a business, but the wreck of a human being must 
be laid at their door who by a splendid capacity for negligence 
do thus expose another to the play of the most subtle temptations 
which can be conceived. 
There is also the mistaken notion that we may escape certain 
responsibilities by simply not assuming them. There are some 
obligations, however, which we do not dare to refuse, and which 
indeed it is not possible to refuse. We have no choice in the 
matter. We cannot say in truth that we have no responsibility, 
for instance, for the general decency and good order of the 
community in which we live, merely because we have chosen to 
keep out of the village politics, and therefore, not being on the 
borough council or the board of health, it is none of our business

if the laws of nature, of man, or of God are violated. It must 
be remembered that responsibilities of such a kind are not 
assumed by definite choice, but belong to us whether we will 
or not. Certain responsibilities we do not choose; they the 
rather choose us. If at times they seem to us vague and in- 
definite, it becomes our duty then to make them definite through 
some effort on our part. We are held to account not merely 
for doing the obvious duty that circumstance may urge upon us, 
but also for creating the circumstance which may give rise to a 
wholly new set of duties. We are not only responsible for lend- 
ing our service to the cause which has a rightful claim upon us, 
but also we may be responsible for the establishing of a cause 
to serve. 
There are those who imagine that in certain relations of life 
there can be devised some natural substitute for the sense of 
responsibility. It is possible, of course, to establish a set of 
automatic checks upon an employee’s activities, of such a nature 
as to reduce his personal responsibility to a minimum. Any 
failure in the performance of his duties is at once mechanically 
discovered by the various systems of time clocks, bell punches, 
cash registers, and the like. This is very well in all cases where 
the labor is that of simple routine. Mechanical activity can 
be checked by a mechanical device. Not so, however, as re- 
gards those duties which demand a higher order of capacity— 
such as that of sound judgment, a fine sense of discrimination, 
and the power of resourceful initiative. In all such matters 
there can be no substitute for the responsible personality. 
Man is a responsible being because of this very element of free 
activity in his nature which no mechanical contrivance, however 
ingenious, can ever gauge. We are all so dependent upon the 
integrity, fidelity, and efficiency of man in the more complex 
relations of life that we must at times, and often the most critical, 
trust in him implicitly. We do not proceed far in any under- 
taking without being aware that we are holding another responsi- 
ble, or that some one is holding us responsible for those inevitable 
duties which arise out of the relations of man to man the world 
over. If a man would escape all responsibility he must place

himself wholly outside of the relations of life; for life is responsi- 
bility. As we have seen, responsibility remains with us even 
though we may ask others to assume it; we share it with others, 
but our portion is the same; when we turn our backs upon it, 
we find it still facing us; we flee from it, and, however far it 
may be, we see it waiting for us at the journey’s end. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. What common fallacious ideas of responsibility does the writer 
Set forth? 2. Show the importance of acquiring a high sense of 
responsibility in college. Consider in this connection the following 
paragraph from Briggs’s ‘‘The Mistakes of College Life”: “To many 
boys the beginning of college life is the first step into the world. Its 
dangers are much like those of other first steps in the world, yet with 
this difference: the college boy has the advantage of living where 
ideals are noble, and the disadvantage (if he is weak and immature) of 
living where he need not get heartily tired day after day in keeping 
long, inevitable hours of work. This disadvantage is indeed a privi- 
lege, but a privilege which like all privileges is bad unless accorded 
to a responsible being. To discipline one’s self, to hold one’s self 
responsible, is ever so much better than to be disciplined, to be held 
responsible by some one else; but it is a task for a man. Naturally 
enough, then, the mistakes and sins of college life are commonly rooted 
in boyish irresponsibility.” 3. What special responsibilities rest 
upon the student? 4. Does the present generation need a deeper 
sense of personal responsibility in business and political life?

WHEN A MAN COMES TO HIMSELP 
Wooprow WILSON 
[For note regarding the author, see page r.] 
¥ It is a very wholesome and regenerating change which a 
man undergoes when he “comes to himself.¥ It is not only 
after periods of recklessness or infatuation, when he has played 
the spendthrift or the fool, that a man comes to himself. He 
comes to himself after experiences of which he alone may be 
aware: when he has left off being wholly preoccupied with his 
own powers and interests and with every petty plan that centers 
in himself; when he has cleared his eyes to see the world as it is, 
and his own true place and function in it. 
It is a process of disillusionment. The scales have fallen 
away. He sees himself soberly, and knows under what condi- 
tions his powers must act, as well as what his powers are. He 
has got rid of earlier prepossessions about the world of men and 
affairs, both those which were too favorable and those which 
were too unfavorable—both those of the nursery and those of a 
young man’s reading. He has learned his own paces, or, at 
any rate, is in a fair way to learn them; has found his footing 
and the true nature of the “going” he must look for in the 
world; over what sorts of roads he must expect to make his 
running, and at what expenditure of effort; whither his goal lies, 
and what cheer he may expect by the way. It is a process of

disillusionment, but it disheartens no soundly made man. It 
brings him into a light which guides instead of deceiving him; 
a light which does not make the way look cold to any man whose 
eyes are fit for use in the open, but which shines wholesomely, 
rather, upon the obvious path, like the honest rays of the frank 
sun, and makes traveling both safe and cheerful.

change reserved for the thofoughly sane and healthy, and for 
those who can detach themselves from tasks and drudgery long 
and often enough to get, at any rate once and again, view of the 
proportions of life and of the state and plot of its action. We 
speak often with amusement, sometimes with distaste and un- 
easiness, of men who “have no sense of humor,” who take them- 
- selves too seriously, who are intense, self-absorbed, over-con- 
fident in matters of opinion, or else go plumed with conceit, 
proud of we cannot tell what, enjoying, appreciating, thinking -. 
of nothing so much as themselves. These are men who have 
not suffered that wholesome “chapge. They have not come to 
themselves. If they be serious men, and real forces in the 
world, we may conclude that they have been too much and too 
long absorbed; that their tasks and responsibilities long ago 
rose about them like a flood, and have kept them swimming 
with sturdy stroke the years through, their eyes level with the 
troubled surface—no horizon in sight, no passing fleets, no com- 
rades but those who struggled in the flood like themselves. If 
they be frivolous, light-headed, men without purpose or achieve- 
ment, we may conjecture, if we do not know, that they were 
born. so, or spoiled by fortune, or befuddled by self-indulgence. 
It is no great matter what we think of them. 
It is enough to know that there are some laws which govern 
a‘man’s awakening to know himself and the right part to play. 
_Aman is the part he plays among his fellows. He is not isolated; 
he cannot be. His life is made up of the relations he bears to 
others—is made or marred by those relations, guided by them, 
judged by them, expressed in them. There is nothing else upon 
which he can spend his spirit—nothing else that we can see.
-P-A-G-E-463
  
THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD'S WORK 44t 
It is by these he gets his spiritual growth; it is by these we see 
his character revealed, his purpose, and his gifts. Some play 
with a certain natural passion, an unstudied directness, without 
grace, without modulation, with no study of the masters or 
consciousness of the pervading spirit of the plot; others give all 
their thought to their costume and think only of the audiences; 
a few act as those who have mastered the secrets of a serious 
art, with deliberate subordination of themselves to the great 
end and motive of the play, spending themselves like good 
servants, indulging no wilfulness, obtruding no eccentricity, 
lending heart and tone and gesture to the perfect progress of 
the action. These have “found themselves,” and have all the 
ease of a perfect adjustment. 
Adjustment is exactly what a man gains when he comes to 
himself. Some men gain it late, some early; some get it all at 
once, as if by one distinct act of deliberate accommodation; 
others get it by degrees and quite imperceptibly. No doubt 
‘to most men it comes by,the slow processes of experience—at 
each stage of life a little. cate man feels the first shock of it 
at graduation, when the boy’s life has been lived out and the 
man’s life suddenly begins? He has measured himself with boys; 
he knows their code and féels the spur of their ideals of achieve- 
ment. But what the world expects of him he has yet to find 
out, and it works, when he has discovered it, a veritable revolu- 
tion in his ways both of thought and of action. He finds a 
new sort of fitness demanded of him, executive, thoroughgoing, 
careful of details, full of drudgery and obedience to orders. 
Everybody is ahead of him. Just now he was 4 senior, at the 
top of a world he knew and reigned in, a firiished product and 
pattern of good form. Of a sudden he is a novice again,.as 
green as in his first-school year, studying a thing that seems 
to have no rules—at sea amid cross-winds, and a bit seasick 
withal. Presently, if he be made of stuff that will shake into 
shape and fitness, he settles to his tasks and is comfortable. 
He has come to himself: understands what capacity is, and what 
it is meant for; sees that his training was not for ornament; or 
personal gratification, but to teach him how to use himself      
-P-A-G-E-464
  442, COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
and develop faculties worth using} Henceforth there is a zest 
in action, and he loves to see his strokes tell. 
- The same thing happens to the lad come from the farm into. 
the city, a big and novel field, where crowds rush and jostle, and 
a rustic*boy must stand puzzled fer a little how. to use his 
placid and unjaded strength. It happens, too, though in a 
deeper and more subtle way, to the man who marries for love, 
if the love be true and fit for foul weather. Mr. Bagehot used 
to say that a bachelor was “an amateur in life,” and wit and 
wisdom are married in the jest. ( A man who lives only for him- 
self has not begun to live—has yet to learn his use, and his real 
pleasure too, in the world. It is not necessary he should marry 
to find himself out, but it is necessary he should love. Men have 
come to themselves serving their mothers with an unselfish de- 
votion, or their sisters, or a cause for whose sake they forsook 
ease and left off thinking of themselves. It is unselfish action, 
growing slowly into the high habit of devotion, and at last, it 
may be, into a sort of consecration, that teaches a man the wide 
meaning of his life, and makes of him a steady professional in 
living, if the motive be not necessity, but love. Necessity may 
make a mere drudge of a man, and no mere drudge ever made 
a professional of himself; that demands a higher spirit and a 
finer incentive than his. 
Surely a man has_come to himself only when he has found 
the best that is in him, \ind has satisfied his heart ~vith the highest 
achievement he is fit for.) It is only then that he knows of 
what he is capable and what his heart demands. And, assuredly, 
no thoughtful man ever came to the end of his life, and had 
time and a little space of calm from which to look back upon it, 
who did not know and acknowledge that it was what he had 
done unselfishly and for others, and nothing else, that satisfied 
him in the retrospect, and made him feel that he had played the 
man. That alone seems to him the real measure of himself, the 
real standard of his manhood. And so men grow by having 
responsibility laid upon them, the burden of other people’s 
business., Their powers are put out at interest, and they get 
usury in kind. They are like men multiplied. Each counts 
1

THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 443 
manifold. Men who live with an eye only upon what is their 
own are dwarfed beside them—seem fractions while they are 
integers. The trustworthiness of men trusted seems often to 
grow with the trust. 
It is for this reason that men are in love with power and 
greatness: it affords them so pleasurable an expansion of faculty, 
so latge a run for their minds, an exercise of spirit so various 
and refreshing; they have the freedom of so wide a tract of the 
world of affairs. But if they use power only for their own ends, 
if there be no unselfish service in it, if its object be only their 
personal aggrandizement, their love to see other men tools in 
their hands, they go out of the world small, disquieted, beggared, 
no enlargement of soul vouchsafed them, no usury of satisfac- 
tion. They have added nothing to themselves. Mental and 
physical powers alike grow by use, as every one knows; but 
labor for one’s self alone is like exercise in a gymnasium. No 
healthy man can remain satisfied with it, or regard it as anything 
but a preparation for tasks in the open, amid the affairs of the 
world,—not sport, but business,—where there is no orderly 
apparatus, and every man must devise, the means by which 
he is to make the most of himself. To make the most of him- 
self means the multiplication of his activities, and he must 
turn away from himself for that. He looks about him, studies 
the face of business or of affairs, catches some intimation of their 
larger objects, is guided by the intimation, and presently finds 
himself part of the motive force of communities or of nations. 
It makes no difference how small a part, how insignificant, how 
unnoticed. When his powers begin to play outward, and he 
loves the task at hand not because it gains him a livelihood 
but because it makes him a life, he has come to himself. 
Necessity is no_mother-to enthusiasm. Necessity carries a 
whip. Its method is compulsion, not love. It has no thought 
to make itself attractive; it is content to drive. Enthusiasm 
comes with the revelation of true and satisfying objects of de- 
votion; and it is enthusiasm that sets the powers free. It is 
a sort of enlightenment. It shines straight upon ideals, and 
for those who see it the race and struggle are henceforth toward  
-P-A-G-E-466
444 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
these. An instance will point the meaning. One of the most 
distinguished and most justly honored of our great philan- 
thropists spent the major part of his life absolutely absorbed in 
the making of money—so it seemed to those who did not know 
him. In fact, he had very early passed the stage at which he 
looked upon his business as a means of support or of material 
comfort. Business had become for him an intellectual pursuit, 
a study in enterprise and increment. The field of commerce 
lay before him like a chess-board; the moves interested him 
like the maneuvers of a game. More money was more power, 
a greater advantage in the game, the means of shaping men and 
events and markets to his own ends and uses. It was his will 
that set fleets afloat and determined the havens they were bound 
for; it was his foresight that brought goods to market at the 
right time; it was his suggestion that made the industry of un- 
thinking men efficacious; his sagacity saw itself justified at home 
not only, but at the ends of the earth. And as the money 
poured in, his government and mastery increased, and his mind 
was the more satisfied. It is so that men make little kingdoms 
Yor themselves, and an international power undarkened by 
diplomacy, undirected by parliaments. 
It is a mistake to suppose that the great captains of industry, 
the great organizers and directors of manufacture and commerce 
and monetary exchange, are engrossed in a vulgar pursuit of 
wealth. Too often they suffer the vulgarity of wealth to dis- 
play itself in the idleness and ostentation of their wives and chil- 
dren, who “devote themselves,” it may be, ‘“‘to expense re- 
gardless of pleasure”; but we ought not to misunderstand even 
that, or condemn it unjustly. The masters of industry are 
often too busy with their own sober and momentous calling to 
have time or spare thought enough to govern their own house- 
holds... A king may be too faithful a statesman to be a watch- 
ful father. These men are not fascinated by the glitter of gold: 
the.appetite for power has got hold upon them. They are in 
love with the exercise of their faculties upon a great scale; they 
are organizing and overseeing a great part of the life of the 
world. No wonder they are captivated. Business is more

interesting than pleasure, as Mr. Bagehot said, and when once 
the mind has caught its zest, there’s no disengaging it. . The 
world has reason to be grateful for the fact. 
It was this fascination that had got hold upon the faculties 
of the man whom the world was afterward to know, not as a 
prince among merchants,—for ‘the world forgets merchant 
princes,—but as a prince among benefactors; for beneficence 
breed’ gratitude, gratitude admiration, admiration fame, and 
the world remembers its benefactors. Business, and business 
alone, interested him, or seemed to him worth while. The first 
time he was asked to subscribe money for a benevolent object 
he declined. Why should he subscribe? What affair would be 
set forward, what increase of efficiency would the money buy, 
what return would it bring in? Was good money to be simply 
given away, like water poured on a barren soil, to be sucked up 
and yield nothing? It was not until men who understood 
benevolence on its sensible, systematic, practical, and really 
helpful side explained it to him as an investment that his mind 
took hold of it and turned to it for satisfaction. He began to 
see that education was a thing of infinite usury; that money 
devoted to it would yield a singular increase, to which there was 
no calculable end, an increase in perpetuity,—increase of 
knowledge, and therefore of intelligence and efficiency, touching 
generation after generation with new impulses, adding to the . 
sum total of the world’s fitness for affairs,—an invisible but 
intensely real spiritual usury beyond reckoning, because~com- 
pounded in an unknown ratio from age to age. Henceforward 
beneficence was as interesting to him as business—was, indeed, 
a sort’ of sublimated business in which money moved new forces 
in a commerce which no man could bind or limit. 
He had come to himself—to the full realization of his powers, 
the true and clear perception of what it.was his mind demanded 
for its satisfaction. His faculties were consciously stretched 
to their right measure, were at last exercised at their best. He 
felt the keen zest, not of success merely, but also of honor, and 
was raised to a sort of majesty among his fellow-men, who at- 
tended him in death like a dead sovereign. He had died 
dwarfed had he not broken the bonds of mere money-getting;  
-P-A-G-E-468
  446 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
would never have known himself had he not learned how to 
spend it; and ambition itself could not have shown him a 
straighter road to fame. 
This is the positive side of a man’s discovery-of the way 
in which his faculties are to be made to fit into the world’s 
affairs and released for effort in a way that will bring real satis- 
faction. There is a negative side also. } Men come to themselves 
by discovering their limitations no léss than by discovering 
their deeper entowmentsamtthe mastery that will make them 
happy. It is the discovery of what they can dt do, and ought 
not to attempt, that transforms reformers into statesmen; and 
great should be the joy of the world over every reformer who 
comes to himself. The spectacle is not rare; the method‘is not 
hidden. The practicability of every reform is determined 
absolutely and always by “the circumstances of the case,” 
and only those who put themselves into the midst of affairs, 
either by action onday observation, can know what those circum- 
stances are or perce#ve what they signify. No statesman dreams 
of doing whatever he pleases; he knows that it does not follow 
that because a point of morals or of policy is obvious to him it 
will be obvious to the nation, or even to his own friends; and it 
is the strength of a democratic polity that there are so many 
minds to be consulted and brought to agreement, and that 
nothing can be wisely done for which the thought, and a good 
dea} more than the thought, of the country, its sentiment’and its 
purpose, have not been prepared. Social reform is a matter of 
codperation, and, if it be of a novel kind, requires an infinite 
Realbomeonverine to bring the efficient majority to believe in, 
it and support it. Without their agreement and support it is * 
impossible. 
It is this that the more imaginative and impatient reformers 
find out when they com to themselves, if that calming change 
. ever comes to them. \ Oftentimes the most immediate and 
drastic means of bringing them to themselves is to elect them to 
legislative or executive office. That will reduce oversanguine 
persons to their simplest terms. .Not because they find their 
fellow legislators or officials incapable of high purpose or in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-469
    THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 447 
different to the betterment of the communities which they 
represent. Only cynics hold that to be the chief reason why 
we approach the millennium so slowly, and cynics are usually 
very ill-informed persons. Nor is it because under our modern 
democratic arrangements we so subdivide power and balance 
parts in government that no one man can tell for much or 
turn affairs to his will. One of the most instructive studies 
a politician could undertake would be a study of the infinite 
limitations laid upon the power of the Russian Czar, notwith- 
standing the despotic theory of the Russian constitution— 
limitations of social habit, of official prejudice, of race jealousies, 
of religious predilections, of administrative machinery even, 
and the inconvenience of being himself only one man, and that 
a very young one, oversensitive and touched with melancholy. 
He can do only what can be done with the Russian people. 
He can no more make them quick, enlightened, and of the modern 
world of the West than he can change their tastes in eating. 
He is simply the leader of Russians. 
An English or American statesman is bet’ er off. He leads a 
thinking nation, not a race of peasants topped by a class of 
revolutionists and a caste of nobles and officials. ( He can ex- 
plain new things to men able to understand, persuade men 
willing and accustomed to make independent and intelligent 
choices of their own. An English statesman has an even better 
opportunity to lead tan an American statesman, because in 
England executive power and legislative initiative are poth 
intrusted to the same grand committee, the ministry of the day. 
The ministers both propose what shall be made law and deter- 
»mine how it shall be enforced when enacted. And yet English 
reformers,. like American, have found office a veritable cold- 
water bath for their ardor for change. “Many a man. who has 
made his plaée in affairs as the spokesman of those who see 
abuses and demand their reformation hs passed from denuncia- 
tion to calm and moderate advice when hg got into Parliament, + 
and has turned veritable conservative when made a minister of 
the crown. Mr. Bright was a notable example. Slow and 
careful men had looked upon him as little better than a revolu-

platforms of public meetings. They greatly feared the influ- 
ence he should exercise in Parliament, and would have deemed 
the constitution itself unsafe could they have foreseen that, he 
would some day be invited to take office and a hand of direction 
in affairs. But it turned out that there was nothing to fear. 
Mr. Bright lived to see almost every reform he had urged 
  accepted and embodied in legislation; but he assisted at the . 
process of their realization with greater and greater temperate- 
ness and wise deliberation as his part in affairs became more 
and more prominent and responsible, and was at the last as little

first time they see in its entirety what it was that they were 
attempting. They are at last at close quarters with the world. 
Men of every interest and variety crowd about them; new im- 
pressions throng them; in the midst of affairs the former special 
objects of their zeal fall into new environments, a better and 
newer perspective; seem no longer susceptible to separate and 
radical change. The real nature of the complex stuff of life 
they were seeking to work in is revealed to them,—its intricate 
and delicate fiber, and the subtle, secret interrelationship of its 
parts,—and they work circumspectly, lest they should mar 
more than they mend. Moral enthusiasm is not, uninstructed 
and of itself, a suitable guide to practicable amd lasting reforma- 
tion; and if the reform sought be the reformation of others as 
well as of himself the reformer should look to it that he knows | 
the true relation of his will to the wills of those he would change 
and guide. When he has discovered that relation he has come 
to himself: has discovered his real use and planning part in 
the general world of men; has come to the ful] command and 
satisfying employment of his faculties. Otherwise he is doomed 
to live forever in a fools’ paradise, and can be said to have come 
to himself only on the supposition that he is a fool. )

Every man—if I may adopt and paraphrase a passage from 
Dr. South—every man hath both an absolute and a relative 
capacity: an absolute in that he hath been endued with such a 
nature and such parts and faculties; and a relative in that he is 
part of the universal community of men, and so stands in such 
a relation to the whole. When we say that a man has come 
to himself, it is not of his absolute capacity that we are thinking, 
but of his relative. He has begun to realize that he is part of 
a whole, and to know what part, suitable for what service and 
achievement. 
It was once fashionable—and that not a very long time ago 
—to speak of political society with a certain distaste, as a 
-necessary evil, an irritating but inevitable restriction upon the * 
“natural” sovereignty and entire self-government of the 
individual. That was the dream of the egotist. It was a 
theory in which men were seen to strut in the proud consciousness 
of their several and “absolute” capacities. It would be as 
instructive as it would be difficult to count the errors it has 
bred in political thinking. As a matter of fact, men have never 
dreamed of wishing to do without the “trammels” of organized 
society, for the very good reason that those trammels are in 
reality no trammels at all, but indispensable aids and spurs to 
the attainment of the highest and most enjoyable things man 
is capable of. Political society, the life of men in states, is an 
abiding natural relationship. It is neither a mere convenience 
nor a mere necessity. It is not a mere voluntary association, 
not a mere corporation. It is nothing deliberate or artificial, 
devised for a special purpose. It is in real truth the eternal 
and natural expression and embodiment of a form of life higher 
than that of the individual—that common life of mutual help- 
fulness, stimulation, and contest which gives leave and oppor- 
tunity to the individual life, makes it possible, makes it full 
and complete. x 
It is in such a scene that man looks about to discover his own 
place‘and force. In the midst of men organized, infinitely cross- 
related, bound by ties of interest, hope, affection, subject to 
authorities, to opinion, to passion, to visions and desires which

no man can reckon, he casts eagerly about to find where he may 
enter in with the rest and be a man among his fellows. In 
making his place he finds, if he seek intelligently and with eyes 
that see, more than ease of spirit and scope for his mind. He 
finds himself—as if mists had cleared away about him and he 
knew at last his neighborhood among men and tasks. 
What every man seeks is satisfaction. He deceives himself 
so long as he imagines it to lie in self-indulgence, so long as he 
deems himself the center and object of effort. His mind is 
spent in vain'upon itself. Not in action itself, not in “pleas- 
ure,” shall it find its desires satisfied, but in consciousness of 
right, of powers greatly and nobly spent. It comes to know 
itself in the motives which satisfy it, in the zest and power of 
rectitude. Christianity has liberated the world, not as a sys- 
tem of ethics, not as a philosophy of altruism, but by its revela- 
tions of the power of pure and unselfish love. Its vital principle 
is not its code, but its motive. [Love, clear-sighted, loyal, 
personal, is its breath and immortality. “Christ_came, not to 
save himself, assuredly, but to save the worldHis motive, 
his example, are every man’s key to his own gifts and happiness. 
The ethical code he taught may no doubt be matched, here a 
piece and there a piece, out of other religions, other teachings 
and philosophies. Every thoughtful man born with a conscience 
must know a code of right and of pity to which he ought to 
conform; but without the motive of Christianity, without love, 
he may be the purest altruist and yet be as sad and as unsatisfied 
as Marcus Aurelius. » 
Christianity gave us, in the fullness of time, the perfect 
image of right living, the secret of social and of individual ° 
well-being; for the two are not separable, and the man who 
receives and Sie id that secret in his own living has discovered 
not only the best and only way to serve the world, but also the 
one hay way to satisfy himself. Then, indeed, has he come 
tohimself. ws what his powers mean, what 
spiritual air they breathe, what ardors of service clear them of 
lethargy, relieve them of all sense of effort, put them at their 
best. After this fretfulness passes away, experience mellows'

TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. Explain what the phrase “coming to himself”? means. Give 
instances of historical figures or persons of your own acquaintance 
who have passed through such a development. 2. In what ways 
might college education tend to obviate the nondescript period of 
finding one’s self in early manhood? 3. It is often said that one’s 
life is a constant education. In connection with this discussion about 
adjustment to life’s work, discuss what is the educational effect of . 
one’s life work? 4. How far is opportunity to be allowed to determine 
one’s choice of his career? To what extent should one be guided by 
his ambition in this matter? How far by duties to others? 5. Do 
you agree or disagree with the writer’s position in regard to the reason 
why men love power and greatness (page 443)? 6. What is the mo- 
tive back of notable philanthropic gifts? Is the author right in his 
view of this matter? 7. When misfortune comes, what resources 
has the unselfish man which the selfish man does not possess? 7. Has 
the college man with a strong college spirit, or the public man who 
works for his city or state, a source of satisfaction which those without 
this spirit do not possess? What is its nature? 8. Is it possible to 
be overenthusiastic in reforms? Can you give any instances from 
your experience or reading, especially any that may show how the 
would-be reformer has had his ambition curbed by facing the practical 
problems in the way described in this selection? 9. How can one 
develop altruism in himself? 10. This discussion has dealt with the 
tpan ‘after he begins his work in the world. Show how there is such 
a ne as a man finding himself in regard to his college career after a 
period of neglect of or indifference to his college duties.

THE CALL OF THE JOB! 
RicHARD CLARKE CABOT 
[Richard Clarke Cabot (1868 ) isa physician of Boston whose efficient 
devotion to good works is recorded in many useful ways in the fields of medi- 
cine and educational and philanthropic work. This selection, although a 
magazine article, is really a part of the author’s book, What Men Live By, a 
stimulating discussion of the part that should be played in life by four 
elements—work, play, love, and worship.]   
A camper starting into the woods on his annual vacation 
undertakes with enthusiasm the familiar task of carrying a 
Saranac boat upon a shoulder yoke. The pressure of the yoke 
on his shoulders feels as good as the grasp of an old friend’s 
hand. The tautening of his muscles to the strain of carrying 
seems to gird up his loins and true up his whole frame. With 
the spring of the ground beneath him and the elastic rebound 
of the boat on its springy yoke, he seems to dance over the 
ground between two enlivening rhythms. It is pure fun. 
In the course of half a mile or so, the carry begins to feel like 
work. The pleasant, snug fit of the yoke has become a very 
respectable burden, cheerfully borne for the sake of the object 
in view, but not pleasant. The satisfaction of the carry is now 
something anticipated, no longer grasped in the present. The 
job is well worth while, but it is no joke. It will feel good to 
reach the end and set the boat down. 
Finally, if in about ten minutes more there is still no sight 
of the end, no blue sparkling glimmer of distant water low 
down among the trees, the work becomes drudgery. Will it 
ever end? Are we on the right trail at all? Is it worth while 
to go on? 
Perhaps not, but to stop means painfully lowering the boat 
to the ground and later heaving it up again, which is the worst 
task of all—worse than going on as we are. So we hang to it, 
but: now in scowling, stumbling, swearing misery, that edges 
always nearer to revolt.

THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 453, 
In varying proportions every one’s life mingles the experiences 
of that carry. At its best and for a few, work becomes play, 
at least for blessed jewel-like moments. By the larger number 
it is seen not a joy but as a tolerable burden, borne for the sake 
of the children’s education, the butter on the daily bread, the 
hope of promotion. Finally, for the submerged fraction of 
humanity who are forced to labor without choice and almost 
from childhood, life seems drudgery, borne simply because 
they cannot stop without still greater misery. They are com- 
mitted to it, as to a prison, and they cannot get out. 
It is not often, I believe, that a whole life is possessed by 
any one of, these elements,—play, work, or drudgery. Work 
usually makes up the larger part of life, with play and drudgery 
sprinkled in. Some of us at most seasons, all of us at some 
seasons, find work a galling yoke to which we have to submit 
blindly or angrily for a time, but with revolt in our hearts. Yet 
I have rarely seen drudgery so overwhelming as to crush out 
altogether the play of humor and good fellowship during the 
day’s toil as well as after it. 
In play you have what you want. In work you know what you 
want and believe that you are serving or approaching it. In 
drudgery no desired object is in sight; blind forces push you on. 
In all work and all education the worker should be in touch 
with the distant sources of interest, else he is being trained to 
slavery, not to self-government and self-respect. 
Present good, future good, no good,—these possibilities are 
mingled in the crude ore which we ordinarily call work. Out 
of that we must smelt, if we can, the pure metal of a vocation 
fit for the spirit of man. The crude mass of “work”? as it exists 
to-day in mines, stores, railroads, schoolrooms, studies, and 
ships, contains elements that should be abolished, elements that 
are hard, but no harder than we need to call out the best of us, 
and here and there a nugget of pure delight. 
Defined in this way, work is always, I suppose, an acquired 
taste. For its rewards are not immediate, but come in fore- 
tastes and aftertastes. It involves postponement and waiting. 
 
-P-A-G-E-476
  454 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
In the acquisition of wealth, economists rightly distinguish 
labor and waiting; but in another sense labor is always waiting. 
You work for your picture or your log-house because you want 
it, and because it cannot be had just for the asking. It awaits 
you in a future visible only to imagination. Into the further 
realization of that future you can penetrate only by work; 
meantime you must wait for your reward. 
Further, this future is never perfectly certain. There is many 
a slip between the cup and the lip, and even when gross accidents 
are avoided, your goal,—your promotion, your home, the degree 
for which you have worked, usually do not turn out to be what 
you have pictured them. This variation you learn to expect, to 
discount, perhaps to enjoy, beforehand, if you are a trained work- 
er, just because you have been trained in faith. For work is 
always justified by faith. Faith, holding the substance (not the 
details) of things unseen, keeps us at our tasks. We have faith 
that our efforts will some day reach their goal, and that this goal 
will be something like what we expected. But no literalism will 
serve us here. If we are willing to accept nothing but the very 
pattern of our first desires, we are forever disappointed in work 
and soon grow slack iri it. In the more fortunate of us, the love 
of work includes a love of the unexpected, and finds a pleasant 
spice of adventure in the difference between what we work for 
and what we actually get. 
Yet this working faith is not pure speculation. It includes a 
foretaste of the satisfaction to come. We plunge into it as we 
jump into a cold bath, not because the present sensations are 
altogether sweet, but because they are mingled with a dawning 
awareness of the glow to follow. We do our work happily 
because the future is alive in the present,—not like a ghost but 
like a leader. 
Where do we get this capacity to incarnate the future and to 
feel it swelling within us as a present inspiration? The power 
togo in pursuit of the future with seven-leagued boots or magic 
carpets can hardly be acquired or even longed for until we have 
had some actual experience of its rewards. We seem, then, to
-P-A-G-E-477
  
THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD'S WORK 455 
be caught in one of those circles which may turn out to be either 
vicious or virtuous. In the beginning something, or somebody, 
must magically entice us into doing a bit of work. Having 
done that bit, we can see the treasure of its results; these 
results will in turn spur us to redoubled efforts, and so once more 
to increased rewards. Given the initial miracle and we are 
soon established in the habit and in the enjoyment of work. 
But there is a self-maintaining circularity in disease, idleness, 
and sloth, as well as in work, virtue, and health. Until we get 
the result of our work, we cannot feel the motive for exertion. 
Until we make the exertion (despite present pain and a barren 
outlook) «we cannot taste the delightful result, or feel the spur 
to further effort. The wheel is at the dead point! Why should 
it ever move? 
Probably some of us are moved at first by the leap of an 
elemental instinct in our muscles, which act before and beyond 
our conscious reason. Other people are tempted into labor by 
the irrational contagion of example. We want to be “in it” 
with the rest of our gang, or to win some one’s approval. So we 
get past the dead point,—often a most alarming point to parents 
and teachers,—and once in motion, keep at it by the circular 
process just described. 
Various auxiliary motives reinforce the ordinary energies of 
work. Here I will allude only to one—a queer pleasure in the 
mere stretch and strain of our muscles. If we are physically 
fresh and not worried, there is a grim exhilaration, a sort of 
frowning delight, in taking up a heavy load and feeling that 
our strength is adequate to it. It seems paradoxical to enjoy a 
discomfort, but the paradox is now getting familiar. For 
modern psychologists have satisfactorily bridged the chasm 
between pleasure and pain, so that we can now conceive what 
athletes and German poets have long felt, the delight in a 
complex of agreeable and disagreeable elements. In work we 
do not often get as far as the “selige Schmerzen” so familiar 
in German lyrics, but we welcome difficulties, risks, and physical 
strains because (if we can easily conquer them) they add a spice 
to life,—a spice of play in the midst of labor.
-P-A-G-E-478
486 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS | 
Work gets itself started, then, by the contagion of some- 
body else’s activity or by an explosion of animal energies within 
us. After a few turns of the work-rest cycle we begin to get a 
foretaste of rewards. A flavor of enjoyment appears in the 
midst of strain. Habit then takes hold and carries us along 
until the taste for work is definitely acquired. 
In the crude job as we get it there is much rubbish. For 
work is a very human product. It is no better than we have 
made it, and even when it is redeemed from brutal drudgery it 
is apt to be scarred and warped by our stupidities and our in- 
eptitudes. Out of the rough-hewn masses in which work 
comes to us it is our business—it is civilization’s business—to 
shape a vocation fit for man. We shall have to remake it again 
and again; meantime, before we reject what we now have, it 
is worth while to see what we want. 
What (besides better hours, better wages, healthier condi- 
tions) are the points of a good job? Imagine a sensible man 
looking for a satisfactory work, a vocational adviser guiding 
novices toward the best available occupation, and a statesman 
trying to mold the industrial world somewhat nearer to the 
heart’s desire,—what should they try for? Physical and finan- 
cial standards determine what we get out of a job. But what 
shall we get im it? Much or little, I think, according to its 
fitness or unfitness for our personality,—a factor much neglected 
nowadays. * 
Among the points of a good job I shall name seven:—1. Diffi- 
culty and crudeness enough to call out our latent powers of 
mastery. 2. Variety and initiative balanced by monotony and 
supervision. 3. A boss. 4. A’chance to achieve, to build 
something and to recognize what we have done. 5. A title 
and a place which is ours. 6. Connection with some institu- 
tion, some firm, or some cause, which we can loyally serve. 
7. Honorable and pleasant relations with our comrades in work. 
Fulfil these conditions and work is one of the best things in, 
life. Let me describe them more fully. 
We want a chance to subdue. We want to encounter the taw

THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 457 
and crude. Before the commercial age, war, hunting, and agri- 
culture gave us this foil. We want it still, and for the lack of 
it often find our work too soft. 
Of course, we can easily get an over-dose of crude seats 
A good job should offer us a fair chance of our winning. We 
have no desire to be crushed without a struggle. But we are 
all the better pleased if the fish makes a good fight before heyields. 
Not only in the wilderness, but wherever we deal with raw 
material, our hands meet adventures. Every bit of wood and 
stone, every stream and every season has its own tantalizing 
but fascinating individuality, and as long as we have health and 
courage, these novelties strike not as a frustration but as a 
challenge. 
Even in half-tamed products, like leather or steel, there are, 
experts tell me, incalculable variations which keep us on the 
alert if we are still close enough to the elemental to feel its 
fascinating materiality. When a clerk sells drygoods over the 
counter, I suppose he has to nourish his frontiersman’s spirit 
chiefly in foiling the wily bargain-hunter or trapping the in- 
cautious countryman. But I doubt if the work is as interesting 
as a carpenter’s or a plumber’s. It reeks so strong of civiliza- 
tion and the “finished product” that it often sends us back to 
the woods to seek in a “vacation” that touch with the elemental 
which should properly form part of daily work. 
We want both monotony and variety. The monotony of work 
is perhaps the quality of which we complain most, and often 
justifiably. Yet monotony is really demanded by almost 
everyone. Even children cry for it, though in doses smaller 
than chose which suit their elders. Your secretary does not 
like her work, if you put more than her regular portion of 
variety into it. She does not want to be constantly under- 
taking new tasks, adapting herself to new situations. She wants 
some regularity in her traveling, some plain stretches in which 
she can get up speed and feel quantity of accomplishment,— 
that is, she wants a reasonable amount of monotony. Change 
and novelty in work are apt to demand fresh thought, and 
redice our speed.  
-P-A-G-E-480
    
458 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
Naturally, there is a limit to this. We want some variety, 
some independence in our work. But we can easily get too 
much. I have heard as many complaints and felt in myself 
as many objections against variety as against monotony. I 
have seen and felt as much discontent with “uncharted freedom” 
as. with irksome restraint. Bewilderment, a sense of incompe- 
tence and of rudderless drifting, are never far off from any one 
of us in our work. There is in all of us something that likes to 
trot along in harness,—not too tight or galling, to be sure-— 
but still in guidance and with support. That makes us show 
our best paces. 
Nor is there anything slavish or humiliating in this. It is 
simply the admission that we are not ready at every moment to 
be original, inventive, creative. We have found out the im- 
mense strain and cost of fresh thinking. We are certain that 
we were not born to be at it perpetually. We want some rest 
in our work, some relief from high tension. Monotony supplies 
that relief. Moreover the rhythmic and habitual elements in us 
(ancient labor-saving devices), demand their representation. 
To do something again and again as the trees, the birds, and our 
own hearts do, is a fundamental need which demands and re- 
ceives satisfaction in work as well as in play. 
For the tragedies and abominations, the slaveries and degrada- 
tions of manual labor we cannot put all the blame on the large 
element of monotony and repetition which such labor often 
contains. We should revolt and destroy any work that was 
not somewhat monotonous. But the point is that work should 
offer to each worker as much variety and independence as he 
has originality and genius, no more and no less. Give us 
either more or less than our share and we are miserable. We 
can be crushed and overdriven by too much responsibility, as 
well as by too little. Our initiative, as well as our docility, can 
be overworked. 
We want a boss, especially in heavy or monotonous labor. 
Most monotonous work is of the sort that is cut out and supplied 
ready tohand. This implies that some one else plans and directs 
it. In so far as we want monotony, therefore, we want to be
-P-A-G-E-481
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 459 
driven, though not overdriven, by a boss. If we are to do the 
pulling some one else should hold the reins. When I am dig- 
ging my wife’s garden beds I want her to specify where they 
shall go. We all want a master of some kind, and most of us 
want a master in human shape. The more manual our work is, 
the more we want him. Boatmen poling a scow through a 
creek need some one to steer and tell them which should push 
harder as they turn the bends of the stream. The steersman 
may be chosen by lot or each may steer in turn, but some boss 
we must have, for when we are poling we cannot well steer and 
we don’t want the strain of trying fruitlessly to do both. This 
example is typical of the world’s work. It demands to be 
bossed, and it is more efficient, even more original when it is 
bossed,—just enough! 
Monotony, then, and bossing we need, but in our own quan- 
tity and also of our own kind. For there are different kinds 
(as well as different doses) and some are better than others. 
For example, to go to the same place of work every day is a 
monotony that simplifies life advantageously for most of us, 
but to teach the same subject over and over again is for most 
teachers an evil, though it may be just now a necessary evil. 
We must try to distinguish. When we delight in thinking 
ourselves abused, or allow ourselves the luxury of grumbling, 
we often single out monotony as the target of our wrath. But 
we must not take all complaints (our own or other people’s) at 
their face value. A coat is a misfit if it is too big or too small, 
or if it puckers in the wrong place. A job can be a misfit in 
twenty different ways and can be complained of in as many 
different tones. Let us be clear about this. If our discontent 
is as divine as it feels, it is not because all monotony is evil, but 
because our particular share and kind of monotony has proved 
to be a degrading waste of energy. 
We want to see the product of our work. The bridge we planned, 
the house we built, the shoes we cobbled, help us to get before 
ourselves and so to realize more than a moment’s worth of life 
and effort. The impermanence of each instant’s thought, the 
transience of every flush of effort tends to make our lives 
 
-P-A-G-E-482
  460 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
seem shadowy even to ourselves. Our memory is like a sieve 
through which most that we pick up runs back like sand. But 
in work we find refuge and stability, because in the accumulated 
product of many days’ labor we can build up and present at 
last to our own sight the durable structure of what we meant to 
do. Then we can believe that our intentions, our hopes, our 
plans, our daily food and drink, have not passed through us 
for nothing, for we have funded their worth in some tangible 
achievement which outlasts them. 
Further, such external proofs of our efficiency win us not only 
self-respect, but the recognition of others. We need something 
to show for ourselves, something to prove that our dreams are 
not impotent. Work gives us the means to prove it. 
I want to acknowledge here my agreement in the charge often 
brought against modern factory labor,—namely that since no 
workman plans or finishes his product, no one can recognize 
his product, take pride in it or see its defects. Even when 
factory labor is well paid, its impersonal and wholesale merging 
of the man in the machine goes far to make it unfit for men and 
women. 
We want a handle to our name. Everyone has a right to the 
distinction which titles of nobility are meant to give, but it is, 
from our work that we should get them. The grocer, the 
trapper, the night-watchman, the cook, is a person fit to be 
recognized, both by his own timid self and by the rest of the 
world. In time the title of our job comes to stand for us, to 
enlarge our personality and to give us permanence. Thus it 
supplements the standing which is given us by our product. 
To “hold down a job” gives us a place in the world, something 
approaching the home for which in some form or other everyone 
longs. ‘‘Have you any place for me?” we ask with eagerness, 
for until we find “a place” we are tramps,—men without a country. 
A man with a job has, at least in embryo, the kind of recogni- 
tion which we all crave. He has won membership in a club 
that he wants to belong to and especially hates to be left out of. 
To be in it as a member in full standing gives a taste of self- 
respect and self-confidence. 
   
-P-A-G-E-483
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD'S WORK 461 
We want congeniality in our fellow workmen. One of the few 
non-physical “points” which people have already learned to 
look for in selecting work, is the temper and character of the 
“boss.” Men, and especially women, care almost as much 
about this as about the hours and wages of the jobs. Young 
physicians will work in a laboratory at starvation wages for the 
sake of being near a great teacher, even though he rarely notices 
them. The congeniality of fellow workmen is almost as im- 
portant as the temper of the boss. Two unfriendly stenog- 
raphers in a single room will often give up their work and take 
lower wages elsewhere in order to escape each other. 
All this is so obvious to those who look for jobs that I wonder 
why so few employers have noticed it. The housewives who 
keep their servants, the manufacturers who avoid strikes, are 
not always those who pay the best wages and offer the best 
condition of work. The human facts—the personal relations 
of employer and employee—are often disregarded, but always 
at the employer’s peril. The personal factor is as great as the 
economic in the industrial unrest of to-day. Are not even the 
“captains of industry” beginning to wake up to this fact? 
Payment can be given a working man only for what some 
other man might have done,—because his pay is fixed by esti- 
mate of “what the work is worth,” that is, what you can get 
other people to do it for. Hence you never pay anyone for 
what he individually does, but for what “a man like him,” that 
fictitious being, that supposedly fair specimen of his type and 
trade, can be expected to do. 
The man himself you caunot pay. Yet anyone who does 
his work well or gets satisfaction out of it, puts himself into it. 
Moreover he does things that he cannot be given credit for, 
finishes parts that no one else will notice. Even a mediocre 
amateur musician knows that the best parts of his playing, his 
personal tributes to the genius of the composer whom he plays, 
are heard by no one but himself and “the God of things as 
they are.” There might be bitterness in the thought that in 
our work we get paid or praised only for what is not particularly 
4 
 
-P-A-G-E-484
  462 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
ours, while the work that we put our hearts into is not recog- 
nized or rewarded. But in the struggle for spiritual existence we 
adapt ourselves to the unappreciative features of our environ- 
ment and learn to look elsewhere for recognition. We do not 
expect people to pay us for our best. We look to the approval 
of conscience, to the light of our ideal seen more clearly when 
our work is good, or to the judgment of God. Our terms differ 
more than our tendencies. The essential point is that for 
appreciation of our best work we look to a Judge more just and 
keen-sighted than our paymaster. 
_ Nevertheless there is a spiritual value in being paid in hard 
cash. For though money is no measure of the individual value 
in work, it gives precious assurance of some value, some use- 
fulness to people out of the worker’s sight. Workers who do not 
need a money wage for the sake of anything that they can buy 
with it, still need it for its spiritual value. Doctors find this 
out when they try to get invalids or neurasthenics to work 
for the good of their health. Exercise done for exercise’s sake, 
is of very little value, even to the body, fot half its purpose is to” 
stimulate the will, and most wills refuse to work at chest-weights 
and treadmills, however disguised. But our minds are still 
harder to fool with hygienic exercises done for the sake of 
keeping busy. To get any health or satisfaction out of work it 
must seem to the worker to be of some use. If he knows that 
the market for raffia baskets is nil, and that he is merely en- 
ticed into using his hands for the good of his muscles or of his 
soul, he soon gets a moral nausea at the whole attempt. 
This is the flaw in ideals of studiousness and self-culture. 
It is not enough that the self-culture shall seem good to President 
A. Lawrence Lowell or to some kind neurologist. The college 
boy himself, the psychoneurotic herself must feel some zest 
along with the labor if it is to do them any good. And this zest 
comes because they believe that by this bit of work they are 
“getting somewhere,” winning some standing among those 
whose approval they desire, serving something or somebody _ 
besides the hired teacher or trainer. 
I once set a neurasthenic patient, formerly a stenographer, 
 
-P-A-G-E-485
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 463 
to helping me with the clerical work in my office. She began 
to improve at once, because the rapid return of her former 
technical skill made her believe (after many months of idleness 
and gnawing worry about money) that some day she might 
get back to work. But what did her far more good was the 
check which I sent her at the end of her first week’s work. She 
had not expected it, for she did not think her work good enough. 
But she knew me well enough to know that I had sworn off 
lying in all forms (even the most philanthropic and hygienic) 
and would not deceive her by pretending to value her work. The 
money was good for what it would buy, but it was even better 
because it proved to her the world’s need for what she could do, - 
and thus gave her a right to space and time upon the earth. 
This is the spiritual value of pay. So far no one has thought 
of so convenient and convincing a way to wrap up and deliver 
at each citizen’s door a parcel of courage for the future, anda 
morsel of self-respect which is food for the soul. But money is 
not the only means of paying people. The goods which money 
™ buys, the ends which’ it helps us to achieve are part of our 
reward, perhaps the most genuine part. But gratitude, service 
to others, and success to our aims are often thought of as the 
proper ends or rewards of work. Do we want them? Can we 
achieve them? Let us see. 
Gratitude given or received is one of the best things in the 
world. We need far more of it and far better quality. Yet I 
have never read any satisfactory account of what it so gloriously 
means. Its value begins just where the value of pay ends. 
Thanks are personal, and attempt to fit an adequate reponse 
to the particular service performed. Pay is an impersonal coin 
which has been handed out to many before it reaches you, and 
will go to many others when it leaves you. It is your right and 
you are not grateful for it. But thanks are a free gift and en- 
rich the giver. There is no nobler art than the art of expressing 
one’s gratitude in fresh, unhackneyed, unexaggerated terms 
which answer devotion with fresh devotion, fancy with new 
fancy, clarity with sincerity. Artists who get their reward

only in money and.in the stale plaudits of clapping hands are 
restless for something more individual. They want to be 
intimately understood and beautifully answered. For such 
gratitude they look to brother artists, to the few who really 
understand. There.they find their best reward;—but even 
this leaves something wanting. 
Why is it so notoriously difficult to accept thanks? Most 
things that I am thanked for I am not conscious of having 
done at all. Obviously the thanks are misdirected. Or, if 
Iam conscious of having done what the thanker is grateful for, 
I am likewise conscious that I only handed on to a third person 
what had previously been given to me. I learned from Smith 
and then enlightened Jones. Smith is the man to thank. Or, 
again, one is thanked for simply carrying out a contract; but 
one could not honorably do less. Thanks for going along the 
usual and necessary road seem gratuitous and undeserved. Or, 
finally one receives gratitude for what one did with joy; that’ 
seems as queer as being thanked for eating one’s dinner. 
But suppose that the deed one is thanked for was not an act 
of passing along what came originally from another as you 
pass money in a street car. Suppose a man has really originated 
something, an invention, a poem, a statue. He hardly claims 
it as his, for he does not know where it came from. He did not 
“make it up.” It sprang into his mind, given to him as much 
as if he had received it from a friend. He does not feel that he 
is the onto receive thanks. The thanks should pass through 
him, as the gift did, to some one else,—to his parents who gave 
him and taught him so much, to his race, his nation, his health, 
his friends, his opportunities. That is where it all came from; 
that is where thanks are due. But each of the influences is 
itself the recipient of countless other influences. Every fact 
in the universe depends on every other fact. Ultimately, then, 
not he but the universe must be thanked. 
He deals with firms and employers, but he looks behind them, 
over their shoulders, and redirects their thanks elsewhere, 
ultimately, if he but knew it, to the World-Spirit. One may 
not remember that spirit. One often does not bother about
-P-A-G-E-487
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 465 
the world’s work. Thinking exhausts some people and fatally 
confuses others. But if one thinks at all he runs up hard against 
the world plan and finds it the bulkiest object in sight. 
The unsentimental male American is quick to reject the idea 
that he cares about serving anybody or anything. He may 
admit that he wants to “make good” in a fair and square way, 
according to the rules of the game. But “service” sounds too 
“stuck up” and Pharisaical for him. 
Nevertheless I firmly believe that his derision is only a ruse 
to conceal his morbid bashfulness and oafish sensitiveness. 
For in point of fact service is one of the things that pretty 
much everybody wants,+ however: much he may disguise it 
and conceal it from himself. I have never seen any more 
unsentimental and raw-boned being than the American medical 
student; yet he is simply hankering for service. Medical 
'. teachers spread before him banquets of tempting “oppertuni- 
ties,” rare “cases,” “beautiful” specimens, easy chances to 
distinguish himself in research and to absorb his medical food 
in predigested mouthfuls. He often remains indifferent. But 
the moment you give him a place to work in a clinic, to serve 
as Dr. Blank’s fourteenth assistant in a hospital where good 
work is done, he will jump at the chance. The work is much 
harder and more monotonous than his regular studies. Much 
of it is not teaching him medicine. He has to go on doing 
Fehling’s test for sugar and trying knee jerks long efter he has 
learned the trick. He has to measure stomach contents, to 
weigh patients, to bandage legs, and to write down names and 
addresses in monotonous routine day after day. Yet he loves 
the job. Despite all the drudgery, he learns far more medicine 
by holding down an actual job of this kind, than by lectures 
and classes. If you separate out the instructive portion of his 
day’s work and present it to him without assigning him any 
regular position and duties, he does not like the work as well or 
learn so much. 
Extraordinarily sound those students’ instincts! The men are 
bored when we offer them more opportunities to do what is 
 
-P-A-G-E-488
    
      466 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
  easy and self-centered, but outside the current of reality. It is 
only when we give them hard, dry work like an assistantship 
in a clinic,—a place where they can accomplish something that 
has a real value in the actual world,—that they fall to with 
real appetite. 
The sense of somebody’s need is, I believe, the most powerful 
motive in the world, one that appeals to the largest number of 
people of every age, race, and kind. It wakes up the whole 
nature, the powers that learn as well as those that perform; 
it generates the vigor of interest that submerges selfishness 
and cowardice; it rouses the inventiveness and ingenuity that 
slumber so soundly in student’s classrooms. For many of us, 
for more every time the world takes a step in the right direction, 
work which is service taps a great reservoir of power, sets free 
our caged and leashed energy. 
I conclude then that pay, gratitude, and service as ends of 
work, have each a value, though not exactly of the sort one 
might expect. What about success as a reward of work? 
Financial rewards are nowadays less advertised than the gen- 
eral prosperity which they express. Civic ideals are kept in the 
foreground, alike by “boosters,” real-estate men, and chambers 
of cornmerce. According to these authorities business success 
means a flourishing city and a contented, healthy community. 
To help build up a fine city is what we are asked to do in case 
we take the investment offered us. A fine city is an efficiently 
managed, well-lighted community, with plenty of schools, parks, 
and churches. But stop a moment. What is the use of such 
a place? 
When we have built and finished this perfect city, with its 
smooth-running goveznment, its crime-freed, sanitary streets 
will be swept and garnished, all ready to begin—what? It is 
hard to hear any answer. Few are interested enough even to 
attempt one. For the interest of civic reform is mainly in the 
process,—far less in the result. Boys who built a boat or a 
play-house usually find that there is far more fun in the process 
of building than in using the finished product. So it is with the 
 
-P-A-G-E-489
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 467 
reform of a slum or a municipal government. The best of it 
is in the reforming. We shall hardly stop to notice it when it 
is perfect. We shall take it for granted as we do the safe de- 
livery of the letters which we post, and be off on another cam- 
paign. Our civic goals are like the scented rushes in “Wood 
and Water.” The most beautiful ones, Alice found, were 
always those just beyond her reach. Perfect adaptation to en- 
vironment, which seems to be what the sanitary and civic 
reformers aim at, would mean absolute stagnation,—attainment 
that buds no more. . For what should stir us further? 
“Well, anyway, to reform our city is the best thing in sight. 
It is certainly in the right direction.” Ah, then we know 
what the right direction is! That is something far more signifi- 
cant than any single step in civic progress. If we know the 
true direction we can point beyond the civic models to something 
toward which they are on the road, and get our satisfaction 
all along its course. 
The worship of “the right direction” is a fundamental 
motive in art and play as well as in work. Every noble game 
and work of art calls for others, incites to pilgrimages, reforms 
and nobler arts. Art is not meant to give us something final; 
everything in it is pointing ahead and gets its justification 
because it is “in the right direction.” Everything in art, as 
in civics, gets the courage to exist and to push on because of its 
readiness to, be corrected by experience to a truer version of 
its own purpose. Sincere people want the true, in their work as 
well as in their thinking. But the truth is an Infinite, and 
the will to approach it is an infinite intention. The fruit of this 
infinite intention would be our utter prostration of self before the 
vision, “Do with me as thou wilt.” “Thy will not mine be done.” 
I cannot see the end of all this. I see reform after reform of 
character and of civilization, progress after progress in science 
and art, rising like mountain ranges, one behind the other. 
But there is no conceivable sense in all these upheavals if they 
are mere changes, mere uneasy shifts in the position of a dream- 
ing world-spirit. To make sense they must be moving in a 
single direction.
-P-A-G-E-490

It is obvious enough that all work is supposed to fulfill 
some one’s plan—the worker’s plan or his master’s. It is good 
for something. But everyone of the goods we buy with our 
work is itself a means to something else, a coin with which to 
purchase something more. The goods we supply, the clothes, 
food, transportation, medicine, knowledge, inspiration which 
we give, are themselves means to something else, perhaps to 
comfort, health, education, courage.. These again are means 
to better work, to civic perfection, to family happiness. But 
these once more are in themselves as worthless as fiat money 
or dolls stuffed with sawdust, unless there is absolute value 
behind them. Happiness, civic perfection, love, are sometimes 
named as the ultimate ends toward which the activities of 
busy men and women are means, but anybody who experiences 
any of these states and is not a Buddhist wallowing in vague 
bliss, finds that they incite us to new deeds. If they are not 
soporific drugs they are spurs to fresh action. 
Taken literally, the ideals of utility and civic reform are like 
the old myth which explained the world’s support as the broad 
back of an elephant. Who supports the elephant? He rests 
on a gigantic tortoise; and who supports the tortoise? No 
answer is audible in the business sections of our cities, in the 
schoolrooms or in the colleges. The church’s answer is derided 
or ignored by a large fraction of us. But it is the right one; 
and we shall learn to listen to it or pay the penalty. Govern- 
ment does not rest ultimately on the consent of the governed, 
but on their conformity to the will of the World-Spirit who 
makes and unmakes civilizations. 
Success in industry, in art, or in love is saved from bitterness 
and disappointment because we regard our achievements far 
more symbolically than we know, and rest far more than we are 
aware upon the backing of God. 
Assuming that in everyone there is an infinite and restless 
desire to get into the life of the World—to share any and all 
life that is hot and urgent or cool and clear,—we can tackle this 
infinite task in two ways: 
By trying to understand the universe in the samples of it

which come into our ken and to draw from these bits a knowl- 
edge which typifies and represents the whole. That is science. 
By trying to serve. Service is one of the ways by which a 
tiny insect like one of us can get a purchase on the whole 
universe. If he finds the job where he can be of use, he is 
hitched to thestar of the world, and moves with it.

THE MORALS OF TRADE?! 
HERBERT SPENCER 
[Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) was a distinguished English philosopher. 
His significance in the history of English thought lies in the fact that he 
was the philosopher of the great scientific movement of the second half of 
the nineteenth century. Spencer tried to effect a synthesis of all scientific 
knowledge and to express in a sweeping general formula the belief in progress 
which pervaded his age. Although as a system his synthetic philosophy, as 
it was called, is not likely to prove long-lived, yet it is extremely valuable 
as a source of suggestiveness and from the historic influence of many of its 
conceptions on the culture of the age.] 
On all sides we have found the result of long personal ex- 
perience to be the conviction that trade is essentially corrupt.

In tones of disgust or discouragement, reprehension or derision, 
according to their several natures, men in business have one 
after another expressed or implied this belief. Omitting the 
highest mercantile classes, a few of the less common trades, 
and those exceptional cases where an entire command of the 
market has been obtained, the uniform testimony of com- 
petent judges is, that success is incompatible with strict in- 
tegrity. To live in the commercial world it appedrs necessary 
to adopt its ethical code: neither exceeding nor falling short of 
it—neither’ being less honest nor more honest. Those who 
sink below its standard are expelled; while those who rise 
above it are either pulled down to it or ruined. As, in self- 
defense, the civilized man becomes savage among savages; so, 
it seems that in self-defense, the scrupulous trader is obliged 
to become as little scrupulous as his competitors. It has been 
said that the law of the animal creation is—“ Eat and be eaten;”” 
and of our trading community it may be similarly said that its 
law is—Cheat and be cheated. A system of keen competition, 
carried on, as it is, without adequate moral restraint, is very 
much a system of commercial cannibalism. Its alternatives 
are—Use the same weapons as your antagonists, or be conquered 
and devoured. 
Of questions suggested by these facts one of the most obvious 
is—Are not the prejudices that have ever been entertained 
against trade and traders, thus fully justified? do not these 
meannesses and dishonesties, and the moral degradation they 
imply, warrant the disrespect shown to men in business? A 
prompt affirmative answer will probably be looked for; but we 
very much doubt whether it should be given. We are rather of 
opinion that these delinquencies are products of the average 
English character placed under special conditions. There is no 
good reason for assuming that the trading classes are intrinsic- 
ally worse than other gasses. Men taken at random from higher 
and lower ranks, would, most likely, if similarly circumstanced, 
do much the same. Indeed the mercantile world might readily 
recriminate. Is it a solicitor who comments on their mis- 
doings? They may quickly silence him by referring to the
-P-A-G-E-493
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD'S WORK 47t 
countless dark stains on the reputation of his fraternity. Is 
it a barrister? His frequent practice of putting in pleas which 
he knows are not valid; and his established habit of taking fees . 
for work that he does not perform; make his criticism somewhat 
suicidal. Does the condemnation come through the press? 
The condemned may remind those who write of the fact that 
it is not quite honest to utter a positive verdict on a book merely 
glanced through, or to pen glowing eulogies on the mediocre 
work of a friend while slighting the good one of an enemy; and 
may further ask whether those who, at the dictation of an em- 
ployer, write what they disbelieve, are not guilty of the serious 
offense of adulterating public opinion. 
Moreover, traders might contend that many of their delin- 
quencies are thrust on them by the injustice of their customers. 
They, and especially drapers, might point to the fact that the 
habitual demand for an abatement of price, is made in utter 
disregard of their reasonable profits; and that to protect them- 
selves against attempts to gain by their loss, they are obliged 
to name prices greater than those they intend to take. They 
might also urge that the strait to which they are often brought 
by the non-payment of accounts due from their wealthier 
customers, is itself a cause of their malpractices: obliging them, 
as it does, to use all means, illegitimate as well as legitimate, for 
getting the wherewith to meet their engagements. In proof of 
the wrongs inflicted on them by the non-trading classes, they 
might instance the well-known cases of large shopkeepers in the 
West-end, who have been either ruined by the unpunctuality of - 
their customers, or have been obliged periodically to stop 
payment, as the only way of getting their bills settled. And 
then, after proving that those without excuse show this disre- 
gard of other men’s claims, traders might ask whether they, 
who have the excuse of having to contend with a merciless 
competition, are alone to be blamed if *hey display a like dis- 
regard in other forms. 
Nay, even to the guardians of social rectitude—members 
of the legislature—they might use the tu quoque argument: 
asking whether bribery of a customer’s servant is any worse
-P-A-G-E-494
  472 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
than bribery of an elector? or whether the gaining of suffrages 
by claptrap hustings-speeches, containing insincere professions 
adapted to the taste of the constituency, is not as bad as getting 
an order for goods by delusive representations respecting their 
quality? No; it seems probable that close inquiry would show 
few if any classes to be free from immoralities that are as great, 
relatively to the temptations, as those which we have been ex- 
posing. Of course they will not be so petty or so gross where 
the circumstances do not prompt pettiness or grossness; nor 
so constant and‘organized where the class-conditions have not 
tended to make them habitual. But, taken with these qualifica- 
tions, we think that much might be said for the proposition 
that the trading classes, neither better nor worse intrinsically 
than other classes, are betrayed into their flagitious habits by 
external causes. 
Another question, here naturally arising, is—‘“Are not 
these evils growing worse?” Many of the facts we have cited 
seem to imply that they are. And yet there are many other 
facts which point as distinctly the other way. In weighing the 
evidence, we must bear in mind that the much greater public 
attention at present paid to such matters is itself a source of 
error—is apt to generate the belief that evils now becoming 
recognized are evils that have recently arisen; when in truth 
they have merely been hitherto disregarded, or less regarded. 
It has been clearly thus with crime, with distress, with popular 
ignorance; and it is very probably thus with trading-dishonesties. 
As it is true of individual beings, that their height in the scale 
of creation may be measured by the degree of their self-conscious- 
ness; so, in a sense, it is true of societies. Advanced and highly- 
organized societies are distinguished from lower ones by the 
evolution of something that stands for a social self-consciousness 
—a consciousness in each citizen, of the state of the aggregate 
of citizens. Among ourselves there has, happily, been of late 
years a remarkable growth of this social self-consciousness; 
and we believe that to this is chiefly ascribable the impression 
that commercial malpractices are increasing. 
Such facts as have come down to us respecting the trade
-P-A-G-E-495
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD'S WORK 473 
of past times, confirm this view. In his “Complete English 
Tradesman,” Defoe mentions, among other maneuvers of 
retailers, the false lights which they introduced into their shops, 
for the purpose of giving delusive appearances to their goods. 
He comments of the “shop rhetorick,” the “flux of falsehoods,” 
which tradesmen habitually uttered to their customers; and 
quotes their defense as being that they could not live without 
lying. He says, too, that there was scarce a shopkeeper who 
had not a bag of spurious or debased coin, from which he gave 
change whenever he could; and that men, even the most honest, 
triumphed in their skill in getting rid of bad money. These 
facts show that the mercantile morals of that day were, at any 
rate, not better than ours; and if we call to mind the numer- 
ous Acts of Parliament passed in old times to prevent 
frauds of all kinds, we perceive the like implication. As 
much may, indeed, be safely inferred from the general state 
of society. 
When, reign after reign, governments debased the coinage, 
the moral tone of the middle classes could scarcely have been 
higher than now. Among generations whose sympathy with 
the claims of fellow-creatures was so weak, that the slave- 
trade was not only thought justifiable, but the initiator of it 
was rewarded by permission to record the feat in his coat of 
arms, it is hardly possible that men respected the claims of 
their fellow-citizens more than at present. Times character- 
ized by an administration of justice so inefficient that there 
were in London nests of criminals who defied the law, and on all 
highroads robbers who eluded it, cannot have been distinguished 
by just mercantile dealings. While, conversely, an age which, 
like ours, has seen so many equitable social changes thrust 
on the legislature by public opinion, is very unlikely to be an 
age in which the transactions between individuals have been 
growing more inequitable. Yet, on the other hand, it is un- 
deniable that many of the dishonesties we have described are 
of modern origin. Not a few of them have become established 
during the last thirty years; and others are even now arising. 
How are the seeming contradictions to be reconciled?
-P-A-G-E-496
  474 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
We believe the reconciliation is not difficult. It lies in the 
fact that while the great and direct frauds have been diminishing, 
the small and indirect frauds have been increasing: alike in 
variety and in number. And this admission we take to be 
quite consistent with the opinion that the standard of commercial 
morals is higher than it was. For, if we omit, as excluded 
from the question, the penal restraints—religious and legal— 
and ask what is the ultimate moral restraint to the aggression 
of man on man, we find it to be—sympathy with the pain 
inflicted. Now the keenness of the sympathy, depending on 
the vividness with which this pain is realized, varies with the 
conditions of the case. It may be active enough to check mis- 
deeds which will cause great suffering; and yet not be active 
enough to check misdeeds which will cause but slight annoyance. 
While sufficiently acute to prevent a man from doing that which 
will entail immediate injury on a given person, it may not be 
sufficiently acute to prevent him from doing that which will 
entail remote injuries on unknown persons. And we find the 
facts to agree with this deduction, that the moral restraint 
varies according to the clearness with which the evil conse- 
quences are conceived. Many a one who would shrink from 
picking a pocket does not scruple to adulterate his goods; and 
he who never dreams of passing base coin will yet be a party to 
joint-stock-bank deceptions. Hence, as we say, the multipli- 
cation of the more subtle and complex forms of fraud is consis- 
tent with a general progress in morality; provided it is accom- 
panied with a decrease in the grosser forms of fraud. 
But the question which most concerns us is, not whether the 
morals of trade are better or worse than they have been, but 
rather—why are they so bad? Why in this civilized state of 
ours is there so much that betrays the cunning selfishness of 
the savage? Why, after the careful inculcations of rectitude 
during education, comes there in after-life all this knavery? 
Why, in spite of all exhortations to which the commercial classes 
listen every Sunday, do they next morning recommence their 
evil deeds? What is this so potent agency which almost neu- 
tralizes the discipline of education, of law, of religion?
-P-A-G-E-497
       THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 475 
Various subsidiary causes that might be assigned must be 
passed over, that we may have space to deal with the chief 
cause. In an exhaustive statement, something would have to 
be said on the credulity of consumers, which leads them to 
believe in representations of impossible advantages; and some- 
thing, too, on their greediness, which, ever prompting them to 
look for more than they ought to get, encourages the sellers to 
offer delusive bargains. The increased difficulty of living 
consequent on growing pressure of population, might perhaps 
come in as a part cause; and that greater cost of bringing up a 
family, which results from the higher standard of education, 
might be added. But all these are relatively insignificant. 
The great inciter of these trading malpractices is intense desire 
for wealth. And if we ask—Why this intense desire? the reply 
is—It results from the indiscriminate respect paid to wealth. 
To be distinguished from the common herd—to be some- 
body—to make a name, a position—this is the universal am- 
bition; and to accumulate riches is alike the surest and the easiest 
way of fulfilling this ambition. Very early in life all learn this. 
At school, the court paid to one whose parents have called in 
their carriage to see him, is conspicuous; while the poor boy, 
whose insufficient stock of clothes implies the small means of 
his family, soon has burnt into his memory the fact that poverty 
is contemptible. On entering the world, the lessons that may 
have been taught about the nobility of self-sacrifice, the rever- 
ence due to genius, the admirableness of high integrity, are 
quickly neutralized by experience: men’s actions proving that 
these are not their standards of respect. It is soon perceived 
that while abundant outward marks of deference from fellow- 
citizens may almost certainly be gained by directing every 
energy to the accumulation of property, they are but rarely 
to be gained in any other way; and that even in the few cases 
where they are otherwise gained, they are not given with 
entire unreserve; but are commonly joined with a more or less 
manifest display of patronage. When, seeing this, the young 
man further sees that while the acquisition of property is quite 
possible with his mediocre endowments, the acquirement of  
-P-A-G-E-498
  476 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
distinction by brilliant discoveries, or heroic acts, or high 
achievements in art, implies faculties and feelings which he does 
not possess; it is not difficult to understand why he devotes 
himself heart and soul to business. 
We do not mean to say that men act on the consciously 
reasoned-out conclusions thus indicated; but we mean that 
these conclusions are the unconsciously-formed products of 
their daily experience. From early childhood, the sayings and 
doings of all around them have generated the idea that wealth 
and respectability are two sides of the same thing. This idea, 
growing with their growth, and strengthening with their strength, 
becomes at last almost what we may call an organic conviction. 
And this organic conviction it is which prompts the expenditure 
of all their energies in money-making. We contend that the 
chief stimulus is not the desire for the wealth itself; but for the 
applause and position which the wealth brings. And in this 
belief we find ourselves at one with various intelligent traders 
with whom we have talked on the matter. 
It is incredible that men should make the sacrifices, mental 
and bodily, which they do, merely to get the material benefits 
which money purchases. Who would undertake an extra 
burden of business for the purpose of getting a cellar of choice 
wines for his own drinking? He who does it, does it that he 
may have choice wines to give his guests and gain their praises. 
What merchant would spend an additional hour at his office 
daily, merely that he might move into a larger house in a better 
quarter? In so far as health and comfort are concerned, he 
knows he will be a loser by the exchange; and would never be 
induced to make it, were it nor for the increased social considera- 
tion which the new house will bring him. Where is the man who 
would lie awake at nights devising means of increasing his 
income in the hope of being able to provide his wife with a 
carriage, were the use of the carriage the sole consideration? 
It is because of the éclat which the carriage will give, that he 
enters on these additional anxieties. So manifest, so trite, 
indeed, are these truths, that we should be ashamed of insisting 
on them, did not our argument require it.
-P-A-G-E-499
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD'S WORK 434 
For if the desire for that homage which wealth brings is 
the chief stimulus to these strivings after wealth, then is the 
giving of this homage (when given, as it is, with but little dis- 
crimination) the chief cause of the dishonesties into which 
these strivings betray mercantile men. When the shopkeeper, on 
the strength of a prosperous year and favorable prospects, has 
yielded to his wife’s persuasions, and replaced the old furniture 
with new, at an outlay greater than his income covers—when, 
instead of the hoped-for increase, the next year brings a decrease 
in his returns—when he finds that his expenses are out-running 
his revenue; then does he fall under the strongest temptation to 
adopt some newly-introduced adulteration or other malpractice. 
When, having by display gained a certain recognition, the whole- 
sale trader begins to give dinners appropriate only to those of 
ten times his income, with expensive other entertainments to 
match—when, having for a time carried on this style at a cost 
greater than he can afford, he finds that he cannot discontinue it 
without giving up his position: then is he most strongly prompted 
to enter into larger transactions; to trade beyond his means; 
to seek undue credit; to get into that ever-complicating series of 
misdeeds, which ends in disgraceful bankruptcy. And if these 
are the facts—the undeniable facts—then is it an unavoidable 
conclusion that the blind admiration which society gives to 
mere wealth, and the display of wealth, is the chief source of 
* these multitudinous immoralities. 
Yes, the evil is deeper than appears—draws its nutriment 
from far below the surface. This gigantic system of dishonesty 
branching out into every conceivable form of fraud, has roots 
that run underneath our whole social fabric, and, sending 
fibers into every house, suck up strength from our daily sayings 
and doings. In every dining-room a rootlet finds food when 
the conversation turns on So-and-so’s successful speculations, 
his purchase of an estate, his probable worth—on this man’s 
recent large legacy, and the other’s advantageous match; for 
being thus talked about is one form of that tacit respect which 
men struggle for. Every drawing-room furnishes nourishment, 
in the admiration awarded to costliness—to silks that are “rich,”
-P-A-G-E-500
  478 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
that is, expensive; to dresses that contain an enormous quantity 
of material, that is, are expensive; to laces that are handmade, 
that is, expensive; to diamonds that are rare, that is, expensive; 
to china that is old, that is, expensive. And from scores of 
small remarks and minutie of behavior, which, in all circles, 
hourly imply how completely the idea of respectability involves 
that of costly externals, there is drawn fresh pabulum. 
We are all implicated. We all, whether with self-approba- 
tion or not, give expression to the established feeling. Even 
he who disapproves this feeling, finds himself unable to treat 
virtue in threadbare apparel with a cordiality as great as that 
which he would show to the same virtue endowed with prosperity. 
Scarcely a man is to be found who would not behave with more 
civility to a knave in broadcloth than to a knave in fustian. 
Though for the deference which they have shown to the vulgar 
rich, or the dishonestly successful, men afterwards compound 
with their consciences by privately venting their contempt; 
yet when they again come face to face with these imposing 
externals covering worthlessness, they do as before. And so 
long as imposing worthlessness gets the visible marks of respect, 
while the disrespect felt for it is hidden, it naturally flourishes. 
Hence, then, is it that men persevere in these evil practices 
which all condemn. They can so purchase a homage, which if 
not genuine, is yet, so far as appearances go, as good as the best. 
To one whose wealth has been gained by a life of frauds, what 
matters it that his name is in all circles a synonym of roguery? 
Has he not been conspicuously honored by being twice elected 
mayor of his town? (we state a fact) and does not this, joined 
to the personal consideration shown him, outweigh in his esti- 
mation all that is said against him: of which he hears scarcely 
anything? When, not many years after the exposure of his 
inequitable dealing, a trader attains to the highest civic dis- 
tinction which the kingdom has to offer; and that, too, through 
the instrumentality of those who best know his delinquency; 
is not the fact an encouragement to him, and to all others, 
to sacrifice rectitude to aggrandizement? If, after listening 
to a sermon that has by implication denounced the dishonesties
-P-A-G-E-501
THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD'S WORK 479 
  he has been guilty of, the rich ill-doer finds, on leaving church, 
that his neighbors cap to him; does not this tacit approval go 
far to neutralize the effect of all he has heard? The truth is, 
that with the great majority of men, the visible expression of 
social opinion is far the most efficient of incentives and restraints. 
Let any one who wishes to estimate the strength of this control 
propose to himself to walk through the streets in the dress of 
a. dustman, or hawk vegetables from. door to door. Let him 
feel, as he probably will, that he had rather do something 
morally wrong than commit such a breach of usage, and suffer 
the resulting derision. And he will then better estimate how 
powerful a curb to men is the open disapproval of their fellows; 
and how, conversely, the outward applause of their fellows is 
a stimulus surpassing all others in intensity. Fully realizing 
which facts, he will see that the immoralities of trade are in 
great part traceable to an immoral public opinion. 
Let none infer, from what has been said, that the payment 
of respect to wealth rightly acquired and rightly used, is depre- 
cated. In its original meaning, and in due degree, the feeling 
which prompts such respect is good. Primarily, wealth is the 
sign of mental power; and this is always respectable. To have 
honestly-acquired property implies intelligence, energy, self- 
control; and these are worthy of the homage that is indirectly 
paid to them by admiring their results. Moreover, the good 
administration and increase of inherited property also requires 
its virtues; and therefore demands its share of approbation. 
And besides being applauded for their display of faculty, men 
who gain and increase wealth are to be applauded as public 
benefactors. For he who as manufacturer or merchant, has, 
without injustice to others, realized a fortune, is thereby proved 
to have discharged his functions better than those who have 
been less successful. By greater skill, better judgment, or 
more economy than his competitors, he has afforded the public 
greater advantages. His extra profits are but a share of the 
extra produce obtained by the same expenditure: the other 
share going to the consumers. And similarly, the landowner 
who, by judicious outlay, has increased the value (that is, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-502
480 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
productiveness) of his estate, has thereby added to the stock 
of national capital. By all means, then, let the right acquisition 
and proper use of wealth have their due share of admiration. 
But that which we condemn as the chief cause of commercial 
dishonesty is the indiscriminate admiration of wealth—an 
admiration that has little or no reference to the character of 
the possessor. When, as very generally happens, the external 
signs are reverenced, where they signify no internal worthiness 
—nay, even where they cover internal unworthiness; then does 
the feeling become vicious. It is this idolatry which worships 
the symbol apart from the thing symbolized, that is the root 
of all these evils we have been exposing. So long as men pay 
homage to those social benefactors who have grown rich honestly, 
they give a wholesome stimulus to industry; but when they 
accord a share of their homage to those social malefactors who 
have grown rich dishonestly, then do they foster corruption— 
then do they become accomplices in all these frauds of commerce. 
As for remedy, it manifestly follows that there is none save 
a purified public opinion. When that abhorrence which society 
now shows to direct theft is shown to theft of all degrees of 
indirectness, then will these mercantile vices disappear. When 
not only the trader who adulterates or gives short measure, but 
also the merchant who overtrades, the bank-director who 
countenances an exaggerated report, and the railway-director 
who repudiates his guarantee, come to be regarded as of the 
same genus as the pickpocket, and are treated with like dis- 
dain; then will the morals of trade become what they should be. 
We have little hope, however, that any such higher tone of 
public opinion will shortly be reached. The present condition 
of things appears to be, in great measure, a necessary accompani- 
ment of our present phase of progress. Throughout the civilized 
world, especially in England, and above all in America, social 
activity is almost wholly expended in material development. 
To subjugate Nature, and bring the powers of production and 
distribution to their highest perfection is the task of our age; 
and probably of many future ages. And as in times when 
national defense and conquest were the chief desiderata, mili- 
 
-P-A-G-E-503
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD'S WORK 481 
tary achievement was honored above all other things; so now, 
when the chief desideratum is industrial growth, honor is most 
conspicuously given to that which generally indicates the 
aiding of industrial growth. The English nation at present 
displays what we may call the commercial diathesis; and 
the undue admiration for wealth appears to be its concomitant 
—a relation still more conspicuous in the worship of “the 
almighty dollar” by the Americans. And while the commercial 
diathesis, with its accompanying standard of distinction, 
continues, we fear the evils we have been delineating can be 
but partially cured. It seems hopeless to expect that men will 
distinguish between that wealth which represents personal 
superiority and benefits done to society, from that which does 
not. The symbols, the externals, have all the world through 
swayed the masses; and must long continue to do so. Even the 
cultivated, who are on their guard against the bias of associated 
ideas, and try to separate the real from the seeming, cannot 
escape the influence of current opinion. We must, therefore, 
content ourselves with looking for a slow amelioration. 
Something, however, may even now be done by vigorous 
protest against adoration of mere success. And it is impor- 
that that it should be done, considering how this vicious senti- 
ment is being fostered. When we have one of our leading 
moralists preaching, with increasing vehemence, the doctrine 
of sanctification by force—when we are told that while a sel- 
fishness troubled with qualms of conscience is contemptible, 
a selfishness intense enough to trample down everything in the 
unscrupulous pursuit of its ends, is worthy of all admiration _ 
—when we find that if it be sufficiently great, power, no matter 
of what kind or how directed, is held up for our reverence; 
we may fear lest the prevalent applause of mere success, to- 
gether with the commercial vices which it stimulates, should 
be increased rather than diminished. Not at all by this hero- 
worship grown into brute-worship, is society to be made better; 
but by exactly the opposite—by a stern criticism of the means 
through which success has been achieved; and by according 
honor to the higher and less selfish modes of activity.
-P-A-G-E-504
482 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
And happily the signs of this more moral public opinion are 
already showing themselves. It is becoming a tacitly-received 
doctrine that the rich should not, as in by-gone times, spend 
their lives in personal gratification; but should devote them to 
the general welfare. Year by year is the improvement of the 
people occupying a larger share of the attention of the upper 
classes. Year by year are they voluntarily devoting more and 
more energy to furthering the material and mental progress of 
the masses. And those among them who do not join in the dis- 
charge of these high functions are beginning to be looked upon 
with more or less contempt by their own order. This latest 
and most hopeful fact in human history—this new and better 
chivalry—promises to evolve a higher standard of honor; and 
so to ameliorate many evils: among others those which we have 
detailed. When wealth obtained by illegitimate means in- 
evitably brings nothing but disgrace—when to wealth rightly 
acquired is accorded only its due share of homage, while the 
greatest homage is given to those who consecrate their energies 
and their means to the noblest ends; then may we be sure that 
along with other accompanying benefits, the morals of trade 
will be greatly purified. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IN WRITING 
1. What is present day opinion of the morals of trade in comparison 
with that expressed in this article which was published in 1864? Do 
your observations justify this current opinion? 2. What does Spencer 
allege as the causes of the low morals of trade? Which of these are the 
most powerful now? 3. “The real question that confronts us when 
we seek to attain an understanding of the present attitude of the 
American people is not whether success is here taken to mean material 
prosperity, but whether material prosperity is not received by us as 
the final test of success and as the sole touchstone of a finished career.” 
Give your opinion on this matter. 4. Contrast the ideals of trade as 
described by Spencer with those described by Wilson in When a Man 
Finds Himself. 5. Define business integrity. How is it related to 
veracity? 6. From your experience in your home community, find 
instances of success based upon integrity. Find also instances of 
failure due to lack of integrity. 7. Many people, especially at the

present time, argue as follows: “He is rich, therefore he must be 
dishonest.” What fallacy is involved in this inference? 8. To what 
extent should an employee carry out the will of an employer who is 
swindling the public? 
THE ROOTS OF HONOR! 
JoHN RUSKIN 
[John Ruskin (1819-1900), art critic and social reformer, was one of the 
great quickening and invigorating forces of the nineteenth century. The 
selection here given shows him as social reformer and is from his book en- 
titled Unto this Last, in regard to which Ruskin said in his preface, “I believe 
them to be the best—that is to say, the truest, rightest-worded, and most 
serviceable—things I have ever written.” In this book he advocated the 
application of Christian principles to the organization of labor, and condemned 
ithe accepted political economy of the day as Self-seeking and unsound. His 
_—idea_of political economy was that it not an abstract science, but a 
“system of conduct founded on the sciences, and impossible, except under 
certain conditions of moral culture.” He accordingly devoted his main 
energies in the latter part of his life to arousing the upper classes to a sense 
of their duties toward the poor, and helping the lower classes to realize their 
opportunities, To this end he wrote, gave his money and labored with his 
hands. While there have been wide differences of opinion about his theories 
of art and his views of political economy and social reform, his entire single- 
ness of aim and his preéminence as a writer of English prose are beyond 
dispute.]   
    
     
Among the delusions which at different periods have possessed 
themselves of the minds of large masses of the human race, 
perhaps the most curious—certainly the least creditable—is 
the modern soi-disant science of political economy, based on the 
idea that an advantageous code of social action may be deter- 
mined irrespectively of the influence of social affection. 
Of course, as in the instances of alchemy, astrology, witch- 
craft, and other such popular creeds, political economy has a 
plausible idea at the root of it. ‘The social affections,” says 
the economist, “are accidental and disturbing elements in human 
nature; but avarice and the desire of progress are constant 
1 Reprinted from Unto this Last.
-P-A-G-E-506

elements. Let us eliminate the inconstants, and, considering 
the human being merely as a covetous machine, examine by 
what laws of labor, purchase, and sale, the greatest accumulative 
result in wealth is attainable. Those laws once determined, 
it will be for each individual afterwards to introduce as much of 
the disturbing affectionate elements as he chooses, and to de- 
termine for himself the result on the new conditions supposed.” 
This would be a perfectly logical and successful method of 
analysis, if the accidentals afterwards to be introduced were of 
the same nature as the powers first examined. Supposing a 
body in motion to be influenced by constant and inconstant 
forces, it is usually the simplest way of examining its course to 
trace it first under the persistent conditions, and afterwards 
introduce the causes of variation. But the disturbing elements 
in the social problem are not of the same nature as the constant 
ones; they alter the essence of the creature under examination 
the moment they are added; they operate, not mathematically, 
but chemically, introducing conditions which render all our 
previous knowledge unavailable. We made learned experiments 
upon pure nitrogen, and have convinced ourselves that it is 
a very manageable gas: but behold! the thing which we have 
"practically to deal with is its chloride; and this, the moment we 
touch it on our established principles, sends us and our apparatus 
through the ceiling. 
Observe, I neither impugn nor doubt the conclusions of 
the science, if its terms are accepted. I am simply uninterested 
in them, as I should be in those of a science of gymnastics 
which assumed that men had no skeletons. jit might be shown,

admirable, the conclusions true, and the science deficient only 
in applicability. Modern political economy stands on a pre- 
cisely similar basis. Assuming, not that the human being 
has no skeleton, but that it is all skeleton, it founds an ossifiant

theory of progress on this negation of a soul; and having shown 
the utmost that may be inade of bones, and constructed a 
number of interesting geometrical figures with death’s-heads 
and humeri, successfully proves the inconvenience of the reap- 
pearance of a soul among these corpuscular structures. Ido not 
deny the truth of this theory: I simply deny its applicability 
to the present phase of the world. 
This inapplicability has been curiously manifested during 
the embarrassment caused by the late strikes of our workmen. 
Here occurs one of the simplest cases, in a pertinent and positive 
form, of the first vital problem which political economy has to 
deal with (the relation between employer and employed); and 
at a severe crisis, when lives in multitudes, and wealth in masces, 
are at stake, the political economists are helpless—practically 
mute; no demonstrable solution of the difficulty can be given by 
them, such as may convince or calm the opposing parties. 
Obstinately the masters take one view of the matter; obstinately 
the operatives another; and no political science can set them at 
one. 
It would be strange if it could, it being not by “science” of 
any kind that men were ever intended to be set at one. Dis- 
putant after disputant vainly strives to show that the interests 
of the masters are, or are not, antagonistic to those of the men: 
none of the pleaders ever seeming to remember that it does not 
absolutely or always follow that the persons must be antago- 
nistic because their interests are. If there is only a crust of 
bread in the house, and mother and children are starving, their 
interests are not the same. If the mother eats it, the children 
want it; if the children eat it, the mother must go hungry to 
her work. Yet it does not necessarily follow that there will be 
“antagonism” between them, and they will fight for the crust, 
and that the mother, being strongest, will get it, and eat it. 
Neither, in any other case, whatever the relations of the persons 
may be, can it be assumed for certain that, because their inter- 
ests are diverse, they must necessarily regard each other with 
hostility, and use violence or cunning to obtain the advan- 
tage.  
-P-A-G-E-508
  486 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
Even if this were so, and it were as just-as it is convenient 
to consider men as actuated by no other moral influences than 
those which affect rats or swine, the logical conditions of the 
question are still indeterminable. It can never be shown 
generally either that the interests of master and laborer are 
alike, or that they are opposed; for, according to circumstances, 
they may be either. It is, indeed, always the interest of both 
that the work should be rightly done, and a just price.obtained 
for it; but, in the division of profits, the gain of the one may or 
may not be the loss of the other. It is not the master’s interest 
to pay wages so low as to leave the men sickly and depressed, 
nor the workman’s interest to be paid high wages if the smallness 
of the master’s profit hinders him from enlarging his business, 
or conducting it in a safe and liberal way. A stoker ought not 
to desire high pay if the company is too poor to keep the engine- 
wheels in repair. 
And the varieties of circumstance which influence these 
reciprocal interests are so endless, that all endeavor to deduce 
rules of action from balance of expediency is in vain. And it is 
meant to be in vain. For no human actions ever were intended 
by the Maker. of men to be guided by balances of expediency, 
“but by balances of justice. He has therefore rendered all 
endeavors to determine expediency futile for evermore. No_ 
man ever knew, or can know, what will be the ultimate result 
to himself, or to others, of_any given line of conduct. But 
every man may know, and most of us do know, what is a just 
and an unjust act. And all of us may know also, that the conse- 
quences of justice will be ultimately the best possible, both to 
others and ourselves, though we can neither say what is best, 
nor how it is likely to come to pass. 
I have said balances of justice, meaning, in the term justice, 
to include affection,—such affection as one man owes to another. 
All right relations between master and operative, and all their 
best interests, ultimately depend on these. 
We shall find the best and simplest illustration of the relations 
of master and operative in the position of domestic servants. 
We will suppose that the master of a household desires only
-P-A-G-E-509
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 487 
to get as much work out of his servants as he can, at the rate 
of wages he gives. He never allows them to be idle; feeds them 
as poorly and lodges them as ill as they will endure, and in all 
things pushes his requirements to the exact point beyond which 
he cannot go without forcing the servant to leave him. In 
doing this, there is no violation on his part of what is commonly 
called “justice.” He agrees with the domestic for his whole 
time and service, and takes them;—the limits of hardship in 
treatment being fixed by the practice of other masters in his 
neighborhood; that is to say, by the current rate of wages for 
domestic labor. If the servant can get a better place, he is 
free.to take one, and the master can only tell what is the real 
market value of his labor, by requiring as much as he will 
give. 
This is a politico-economical view of the case, according to 
the doctors of that science; who assert that by this procedure 
the greatest average of work will be obtained from the servant, 
and, therefore, the greatest benefit to the community, and 
through the community, by reversion, to the servant himself. 
That, however, is not so. It would be so if the servant were 
an engine of which the motive power was steam, magnetism, 
gravitation, or any other agent of calculable force. But he 
being, on the contrary, an engine whose motive power is a Soul, 
the force of this very peculiar agent, as an unknown quantity, 
enters into all the political economist’s equations, without his 
knowledge, and falsifies every one of their results. The largest 
quantity of work will not be done by this curious engine for pay, 
or under pressure, or by help of any kind of fuel which may be 
supplied by the chaldron. It will be done only when the motive 
force, that is to say, the will or spirit of the creature, is brought 
to its greatest strength by its own proper fuel; namely, by 
the affections. 
It may indeed happen, and does happen often, that if the 
master is a man of sense and energy, a large quantity of material 
work may be done under mechanical pressure, enforced by 
strong will and guided by wise method; also it may happen, 
and does happen often, that if the master is indolent and weak 
 
-P-A-G-E-510
  488 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
(however good-natured), a very small quantity of work, and 
that bad, may be produced by the servant’s undirected strength, 
and contemptuous gratitude. But the universal law of the 
matter is that, assuming any given quantity of energy and 
sense in master and servant, the greatest material result ob- 
tainable by them will be, not through antagonism to each other, 
but through affection for each other; and that if the master, 
instead of endeavoring to get as much work as possible from 
the servant, seeks rather to render his appointed and necessary 
work beneficial to him, and to forward his interests in all just 
and wholesome ways, the real amount of work ultimately done, 
or of good rendered, by the person so cared for, will indeed bg: 
the greatest possible. i 
Observe, I say, “of good rendered,” for a servant’s work is 
not necessarily or always the best thing he can give his master. 
But good of all kinds, whether in material service, in protective 
watchfulness of his master’s interest and credit, or in joyful 
readiness to seize unexpected and irregular occasions of help. 
Nor is this one whit less generally true because indulgence 
will be frequently abused, and kindness met with ingratitude. 
For the servant who, gently treated, is ungrateful, treated 
ungently, will be revengeful; and the man who is dishonest to a 
liberal master will be injurious to an unjust one. 
In any case, and with any person, this unselfish treatment 
will produce the most effective return. Observe, I am here 
considering the affections wholly as a motive power; not at all 
as things in themselves desirable or noble, or in any other way 
abstractedly good. I look at them simply as an anomalous 
force, rendering every one of the ordinary political economist’s 
calculations nugatory; while, even if he desired to introduce 
this new element into his estimates, he has no power of dealing 
with it; for the affections only become a true motive power when 
they ignore every other motive and condition of political 
economy. Treat the servant kindly, with the idea of turning 
his gratitude to account, and you will get, as you deserve, no 
gratitude, nor any value for your kindness; but treat him kindly 
without any economical purpose, and all economical purposes will
-P-A-G-E-511
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 489° 
be answered; in this, as in all other matters, whosoever will save 
his life shall lose it, whoso loses it shall find it. 
The next clearest and simplest example of relation between 
master and operative is that which exists between the com- 
mander of a regiment and his men. 
Supposing the officer only desires to apply the rules of dis- 
cipline so as, with least trouble to himself, to make the regiment 
most effective, he will not be able, by any rules, or administra- 
tion of rules, on this selfish principle, to develop the full strength 
of his subordinates. If a man of sense and firmness, he may, 
as in the former instance, produce a better result than would 
¥ obtained by the irregular kindness of a weak officer; but let 
the sense and firmness be the same in both cases, and assuredly 
the officer who has the most direct personal relations with his 
men, the most care for their interests, and the most value for 
their lives, will develop their effective strength, through their 
affection for his own person, and trust in his character, to a 
| degree wholly unattainable by other means. The law applies 
still more stringently as the numbers concerned are larger; a 
charge may often be successful, though the men dislike their 
officers; a battle has rarely been won, unless they loved their 
general. 
1 The difference between the two modes of treatment, and between their effective material 
results, may be seen very accurately by a comparison of the relations of Esther and Charlie 
in Bleak House, with those of Miss Brass and the Marchioness in Master Humphrey's Clock. 
The essential value and truth of Dickens’s writings have been unwisely lost sight of by 
many thoughtful persons, merely because he presents his truth with some color of caricature. 
Unwisely, because Dickens’s caricature, though often gross, is never mistaken. Allowing for 
his manner of telling them, the things he tells us are always true. I wish that he could think 
it right to limit his brilliant exaggeration to works written only for public amusement; and 
when he takes up a subject of high national importance, such as that which he handled in 
Hard Times, that he would use severer and more accurate analysis. The usefulness of that 
work (to my mind, in several respects, the greatest he has written) is with many persons 
seriously diminished because Mr. Bounderby is a dramatic monster, instead of a characteristic 
example of a worldly master; and Stephen Blackpool a dramatic perfection, instead of a char- 
acteristic example of an honest workman. But let us not lose the use of Dickens’s width and 
insight, because he chooses to speak in a circle of stage fire. He is entirely right in his main 
drift and purpose in every book he has written; and all of them, but especially Hard Times, 
should be studied with close and earnest care by persons interested in social questions. They 
will find much that is partial, and, because partial, apparently unjust; but if they examine all 
the evidence on the other side, which Dickens seems to overlook, it will appear, after all their 
trouble, that his view was the finally right one, grossly and sharply told. [Author’s note.]

Passing from these simple examples to the more complicated 
relations existing between a manufacturer and his workmen, 
we are met first by certain curious difficulties, resulting, appar- 
ently, from a harder and colder state of moral elements. It is 
easy to imagine an enthusiastic affection existing among soldiers 
for the colonel. Not so easy to imagine an enthusiastic affection 
among cotton-spinners for the proprietor of the mill. A body 
of men associated for purposes of robbery (as a Highland clan 
in ancient times) shall be animated by perfect affection, and 
every member of it be ready to lay down his life for the life of 
his chief. But a band of men associated for purposes of legal 
production and accumulation is usually animated, it appears, 
by no such emotions, and none of them are in anywise willing 
to give his life for the life of his chief. Not only are we met by 
this apparent anomaly, in moral matters, but by others con- 
nected with it, in administration of system. For a servant or a 
soldier is engaged at a definite rate of wages, for a definite period; 
but a workman at a rate of wages variable according to the 
demand for labor, and with the risk of being at any time thrown 
out of his situation by chances of trade. Now, as, under these 
contingencies, no action of the affections can take place, but 
only an explosive action of disaffections, two points offer them- 
selves for consideration in the matter. 
The first—How far the rate of wages may be so regulated as 
not to vary with the demand for labor. 
The second—How far is it possible that bodies of workmen 
may be engaged and maintained at such fixed rate of wages 
(whatever the state of trade may be), without enlarging or 
diminishing their number, so as to give them permanent in- 
terest in the establishment with which they are connected, 
like that of the domestic servants in an old family, or an esprit 
de corps, like that of the soldiers in a crack regiment. 
The first question is, I say, how far it may be possible to fix 
the rate of wages irrespectively of the demand for labor. 
Perhaps one of the most curious facts in the history of human 
error is the denial by the common political economist of the 
possibility of thus regulating wages; while, for all the important,
-P-A-G-E-513
THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD'S WORK 491 
and much of the unimportant, labor on the earth, wages are 
already so regulated. 
We do not sell our prime-ministership by Dutch auction; 
nor, on the decease of a bishop, whatever may be the general 
advantages of simony, do we (yet) offer his diocese to the 
clergyman who will take the episcopacy at the lowest contract. 
We (with exquisite sagacity of political economy!) do indeed sell 
commissions, but not openly, generalships: sick, we do not 
inquire for a physician who takes less than a guinea; litigious, 
we never think of reducing six-and-eightpence to four-and-six- 
pence; caught in a shower, we do not canvass the cabmen, to 
find one who values his driving at less than sixpence a mile. 
It is true that in all these cases there is, and in every con- 
ceivable case there must be, ultimate reference to the presumed 
difficulty of the work, or number of candidates for the office. 
If it were thought that the labor necessary to make a good 
physician would be gone through by a sufficient number of 
students with the prospect of only half-guinea fees, public 
consent would soon withdraw the unnecessary half-guinea. 
In this ultimate sense, the price of labor is indeed always regu- 
lated by the demand for it; but so far as the practical and im- 
mediate administration of the matter is regarded, the best 
labor always has been, and is, as all labor ought to be, paid by an 
invariable standard. 
“What!” the reader, perhaps, answers amazedly: “pay good 
and bad workmen alike?” 
Certainly. The difference between one prelate’s sermons 
and his successor’s,—or between one physician’s opinions and 
another’s,—is far greater, as respects the qualities of mind 
involved, and far more important in result to you personally, 
than the difference between good and bad laying of bricks 
(though that is greater than most pecple suppose). Yet you 
pay with equal fee, contentedly, the good and bad workmen 
upon your soul, and the good and bad workmen upon your body; 
much more may you pay, contentedly, with equal fees, the good 
and bad workmen upon your house. 
“Nay, but I choose my physician and (?) my clergyman,  
-P-A-G-E-514
  492 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
thus indicating my sense of the quality of their work.” By all 
means, also, choose your bricklayer; that is the proper reward 
of the good workman, to be “chosen.” The natural and right 
system respecting all labor is, that it should be paid at a fixed 
rate, but the good workman employed, and the bad workman 
unemployed. The false, unnatural, and destructive system 
is when the bad workman is allowed to offer his work at half- 
price, and either take the place of the good, or force him by 
his competition to work for an inadequate sum. 
This equality of wages, then, being the first object toward 
which we have to discover the directest available road; the 
second is, as above stated, that of maintaining constant numbers 
of workmen in employment, whatever may be the accidental 
demand for the article they produce. 
I believe the sudden and extensive inequalities of demand 
which necessarily arise in the mercantile operations of an 
active nation, constitute the only essential difficulty which has 
to be overcome in a just organization of labor. The subject 
opens into too many branches to admit of being investigated 
in a paper of this kind; but the following general facts bearing 
on it may be noted. 
The wages which enable any workman to live are necessarily 
higher, if his work is liable to intermission, than if it is assured 
and continuous; and however severe the struggle for work may 
become, the general law will always hold, that men must get 
more daily pay if, on the average, they can only calculate on 
work three days a week, than they would require if they were 
sure of work six days a week. Supposing that a man cannot 
live on less than a shilling a day, his seven shillings he must get, 
either for three days’ violent work, or six days’ deliberate work. 
The tendency of all modern mercantile operations is to throw 
both wages and trade into the form of a lottery, and to make the 
workman’s pay depend on intermittent exertion, and the prin- 
cipal’s profit on dexterously used chance. 
In what partial degree, I repeat, this may be necessary, in 
consequence of the activities of modern trade, I do not here 
investigate; contenting myself with the fact, that in its fatalest
-P-A-G-E-515
  a 
THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD'S WORK 493 
aspects it is assuredly unnecessary, and results merely from 
love of gambling on the part of the masters, and from ignorance 
and sensuality in the men. The masters cannot bear to let 
any opportunity of gain escape them, and frantically rush at 
every gap and breach in the walls of Fortune, raging to be rich, 
and affronting, with impatient covetousness, every risk of ruin; 
while the men prefer three days of violent labor, and three days 
of drunkenness, to six days of moderate work and wise rest. 
There is no way in which a principal, who really desires to help 
his workmen, may do it more effectually than by checking these 
disorderly habits both in himself and them; keeping his own 
business operations on a scale which will enable him to pursue 
them securely, not yielding to temptations of precarious gain; 
and, at the same time, leading his workmen into regular habits 
of labor and life, either by inducing them rather to take low 
wages in the form of a fixed salary, than high wages, subject to 
the chance of their being thrown out of work; or, if this be im- 
possible, by discouraging the system of violent exertion for 
nominally high day wages, and leading the men to take lower 
pay for more regular labor. 
In effecting any radical changes of this kind, doubtless there 
would be great inconvenience and loss incurred by all the 
originators of movement. That which can be done with per- 
fect convenience and without loss, is not always the thing that 
most needs to be done, or which we are most imperatively 
required to do. 
I have already alluded to the difference hitherto existing 
between regiments of men associated for purposes of violence, 
and for purposes of manufacture; in that the former appear 
capable of self-sacrifice—the latter, not; which singular fact is 
the real reason of the general lowness of estimate in which the 
profession of commerce is held, as compared with that of arms. 
Philosophically, it does not, at first sight, appear reasonable 
(many writers have endeavored to prove it unreasonable) 
that a peaceable and rational person, whose trade is buying and 
selling, should be held in less honor than an unpeaceable and 
often irrational person, whose trade is slaying. Nevertheless,
-P-A-G-E-516
  404. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
the consent of mankind has always, in spite of the philosophers, 
given precedence to the soldier. 
And this is right. 
For the soldier’s trade, verily and Le veesly, 4 is not slaying, 
but being slain. This, without well knowing its own meaning, 
the world honors it for. A bravo’s trade is slaying; but the 
world has never respected bravyos more than merchants: the 
reason it honors the soldier is, because he holds his life at the 
service of the State. Reckless he may be—fond of pleasure 
or of adventure—all kinds of bye-motives and mean impulses 
may have determined the choice of his profession, and may 
affect (to all appearance exclusively) his daily conduct in it; 
but our estimate of him is based on this ultimate fact—of which 
we are well assured—that, put him in a fortress breach, with all 
the pleasures of the world behind him, and only death and his 
duty in front of him, he will keep his face to the front; and he 
knows that this choice may be put to him at any moment, and 
has beforehand taken his part—virtually takes such part con- 
tinually—does, in reality, die daily. 
Not less is the respect we pay to the lawyer and physician, 
founded ultimately on their self-sacrifice. Whatever the learn- 
ing or acuteness of a great lawyer, our chief respect for him 
depends on our belief that, set in a judge’s seat, he will strive 
to judge justly, come of it what may. Could we suppose that 
he would take bribes, and use his acuteness and legal knowledge 
to give plausibility to iniquitous decisions, no degree of intellect 
would win for him our respect. Nothing will win it, short of 
our tacit conviction, that in all important acts of his life justice 
is first with him; his own interest, second. 
In the case of a physician, the ground of the honor we render 
him is clearer still. Whatever his science, we should shrink 
from him in horror if we found him regard his patients merely 
as subjects to experiment upon; much more, if we found that, 
receiving bribes from persons interested in their deaths, he was 
using his best skill to give poison in the mask of medicine. 
Finally, the principle holds with utmost clearness as it respects 
clergymen. No goodness of disposition will excuse want of 
 
-P-A-G-E-517
THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 405 
science in a physician or of shrewdness in an advocate; but a 
clergyman, even though his power of intellect be small, is re- 
spected on the presumed ground of his unselfishness and ser- 
viceableness. 
Now there can be no question but that the tact, foresight, 
decision, and other mental powers, required for the successful 
management of a large mercantile concern, if not such as could 
be compared with those of a great lawyer, general, or divine, 
would at least match the general conditions of mind required 
in the subordinate officers of a ship, or of a regiment, or in the 
curate of a country parish. If, therefore, all the efficient 
members of the so-called liberal professions are still, somehow, 
in public estimate of honor, preferred before the head of a 
commercial firm, the reason must lie deeper than in the measure- 
ment of their several powers of mind. 
And the essential reason for such preference will be found 
to lie in the fact that the merchant is presumed to act always 
selfishly. His work may be very necessary to the community; 
but the motive of it is understood to be wholly personal. The 
merchant’s first object in all his dealings must be (the public 
believe) to get as much for himself, and leave as little to his 
neighbor (or customer) as possible. Enforcing this upon him, 
by political statute, as the necessary principle of his action; 
recommending it to him on all occasions, and themselves re- 
ciprocally adopting it; proclaiming vociferously, for law of the 
universe, that a buyer’s function is to cheapen, and the seller’s 
to cheat,—the public, nevertheless, involuntarily condemn 
the man of commerce for his compliance with their own state- 
ment, and stamp him forever as belonging to an inferior grade 
of human personality. 
This they will find, eventually, they must give up doing. 
They must not cease to condemn selfishness; but they will have 
to discover a kind of commerce which is not exclusively selfish. 
Or, rather, they will have to discover that there never was, or 
can be, any other kind of commerce; that this which they have 
called commerce was not commerce at all, but cozening; and 
that a true merchant differs as much from a merchant according
-P-A-G-E-518
496 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
to laws of modern political economy, as the hero of the “ Excur- 
sion” from Autolycus. They will find that commerce is an occu- 
pation which gentlemen will every day see more need to engage 
in, rather than in the business of talking to men, or slaying them: 
that, in true commerce, as in true preaching, or true fighting, 
it is necessary to admit the idea of occasional voluntary loss;— 
that sixpences have to be lost, as well as lives, under a sense of 
duty; that the market may have its martyrdonis as well as the 
pulpit; and trade its heroisms, as well as war. 
May have—in the final issue, must have—and only has not 
had yet, because men of heroic temper have always been mis- 
guided in their youth into other fields, not recognizing what is in 
our days, perhaps, the most important of all fields; so that, while 
many a zealous person loses his life in trying to teach the form 
of a gospel, very few will lose a hundred pounds in showing 
the practice of one. 
The fact is, that people never have had clearly explained 
to them the true functions of a merchant with respect to other 
people. I should like the reader to be very clear about this. 
Five great intellectual professions, relating to daily necessities 
of life, have hitherto existed—three exist necessarily, in every 
civilized nation: 
The Soldier’s profession is to defend it. 
The Pastor’s, to teach it. 
The Physician’s, to keep it in health. 
The Lawyer’s, to enforce justice in it. 
The Merchant’s, to provide for it. 
And the duty of all these men is, on due occasion, to die for it. 
“On due occasion,” namely: 
The Soldier, rather than leave his post in battle. 
The Physician, rather than leave his post in plague. 
The Pastor, rather than teach Falsehood. 
The Lawyer, rather than countenance Injustice. 
The Merchant—What is his “due occasion” of death? 
It is the main question for the merchant, as for all of us. 
For, truly, the man who does not know when to die, does not 
know how to live,
-P-A-G-E-519
THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 497 
Observe the merchant’s function (or manufacturer’s, for in 
the broad sense in which it is here used the word must be under- 
stood to include both) is to provide for the nation. It is no more 
his function to get profit for himself out of that provision than 
it is a clergyman’s function to get his stipend. The stipend 
is a due and necessary adjunct, but not the object, of his life, 
if he be a true clergyman, any more than his fee (or honorarium) 
is the object of life to a true physician. Neither is his fee the 
object of life to a true merchant. All three, if true men, have 
a work to be done irrespective of fee—to be done even at any 
cost, or for quite the contrary of fee; the pastor’s function being 
to teach, the physician’s to heal, and the merchant’s, as I have 
said, to provide. That is to say, he has to understand to their 
very root the qualities of the thing he deals in, and the means of 
obtaining or producing it; and he has to apply all his sagacity 
and energy to the producing or obtaining it in perfect state, 
and distributing it at the cheapest possible price where it is 
most needed. 
And because the production or obtaining of any commodity 
involves necessarily the agency of many lives and hands, the 
merchant becomes in the course of his business the master and 
governor of large masses of men in a more direct, though less 
confessed way, than a military officer or pastor; so that on him 
falls, in great part, the responsibility for the kind of life they 
lead: and it becomes his duty, not only to be always considering 
how to produce what he sells in the purest and cheapest forms, 
but how to make the various. employments involved in the pro- 
duction, or transference of it, most beneficial to the men em- 
ployed. 
And as into these two functions, requiring for their right 
exercise the highest intelligence, as well as patience, kindness, 
and tact, the merchant is bound to put all his energy, so for 
their just discharge he is bound, as soldier or physician is bound, 
to give up, if need be, his life, in such way as it may be demanded 
of him. Two main points he has in his providing function to 
maintain: first, his engagements (faithfulness to engagements 
being the real root of all possibilities i in commerce) ; and, second- 
 
-P-A-G-E-520
    498 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
ly, the perfectness and purity of the thing provided; so that, 
rather than fail in any engagement, or consent to any deteriora- 
tion, adulteration, or unjust and exhorbitant price of that 
which he provides, he is bound to meet fearlessly any form of 
distress, poverty, or labor, which may, through maintenance 
of these points, come upon him. 
Again: in his office as governor of the men employed by him, 
the merchant or manufacturer is invested with a distinctly 
paternal authority and responsibility. In most cases, a youth 
entering a commercial establishment is withdrawn altogether 
from home influence; his master must become his father, else 
he has, for practical and constant help, no father at hand: in 
all. cases.the master’s authority, together with the general tone 
and atmosphere of his business, and the character of the men 
with whom the youth is compelled in the course of it to associate, 
have more immediate and pressing weight than the home in- 
fluence, and will usually neutralize it either for good or evil; 
so that the only means which the master has of doing justice 
to the men employed by him is to ask himself sternly whether 
he is dealing with such subordinate as he would with his 
own son, if compelled by circumstances to take such a posi- 
tion. 
Supposing the captain of a frigate saw it right, or were by any 
chance obliged, to place his own son in the position of a common 
sailor; as he would then treat his son, he is bound always to 
treat every one of the men under him. So, also, supposing the 
master of a manufactory saw it right, or were by any chance 
obliged, to place his own son in the position of an ordinary 
workman; as he would then tieat his son, he is bound always to 
treat every one of his men. This is the only effective, true, or 
practical Rute which can be given oa this point of political 
economy. 
And as the captain of a ship is bound to be the last man to 
leave his ship in case of wreck, and to share his last crust with 
the sailors in case of famine, so the manufacturer, in any com- 
mercial crisis or distress, is bound to take the suffering of it 
with his men, and even to take more of it for himself than he
-P-A-G-E-521
  
THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD'S WORK | 499 
allows his men to feel; as a father would in a famine, shipwreck, 
or battle, sacrifice himself for his son. 
All which sounds very strange: the only real strangeness in 
the matter being, nevertheless, that it should so sound. For 
all this is true, and that not partially nor theoretically, but 
everlastingly and practically: all other doctrine than this re- 
specting matters political being false in premises, absurd in 
deduction, and impossible in practice, consistently with any 
progressive state of national life; all the life which we now possess 
as a nation showing itself in the resolute denial and scorn, by 
a few strong minds and faithful hearts, of the economic prin- 
ciples taught to our multitudes, which principles, so far as ac- 
cepted, lead straight to national destruction. Respecting the 
modes and forms of destruction to which they lead, and, on the 
other hand, respecting the farther. practical working of true 
polity, I hope to reason further in a following paper.

THE POLITICAL DUTIES OF THE CITIZEN?! 
ArTHUR TWINING HADLEY 
  
[Arthur Twining Hadley (1856 ) has been since 1899 president of Yale 
University. Before becoming president, he was professor of political econ- 
omy in that institution. His special field of interest in political science has 
been the practical questions of railroad administration, and on these matters 
he is regarded as one of first authorities in the country. The selection here 
reprinted is the last of a series of lectures delivered in New York City in 
1906, on the John S. Kennedy Foundation in the School of Philanthropy, 
and later published in book form. 
In the early days of the republic it was expected that every 
citizen would devote a part of his time to political life. To the 
man who was desirous of amusement politics supplied an at- 
tractive game. ‘To him who was anxious to do public service 
it furnished the best, and often the only available channel. 
To him who was ambitious for tangible success it offered the 
highest reward. 
But as time has gone on this incidental or occasional practice 
of politics has become very difficult. A man cannot success- 
fully go into public life in this indiscriminate way. We have 
grown older as a nation, and with increased age has come in- 
creased specialization of employment. In a boys’ school 
everybody can spend an hour a day at baseball, and play it 
well enough for all practical purposes. Twenty years later a 
few of the graduates of that school will have gone into pro- 
fessional baseball, and will be giving ali their time to it; the 
rest will not be playing it at all. The conditions which govern 
the practice of politics are different in many ways from what 
they were a hundred years ago. At that time public office 
turnished almost the only reward of ambition; now there are a 
great many other rewards, both commercial and professional. 
At that time the public-spirited man found no recognized 
channels of service except those that he followed by going into 
politics; now there are opportunities of service on relief boards, 
1 Reprinted by permission from Standards of Public Morality, The Macmillan Company.
-P-A-G-E-523
THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 5Or 
and school boards, and a thousand other kinds of boards, which 
have little or no connection with our political organization. 
At that time our communities were so small that each man was 
pretty well known to his neighbors, so that if he ran for office, 
they understood whom they were voting for; now he has to 
spend so much effort telling them about himself in order to 
stand any chance of getting nominated or elected that what was 
once an amusement for the intervals of his professional activity 
has become a most serious matter of business. 
I still think that every American citizen ought to assume 
political responsibilities. But as I look at the matter, there are 
at least four different ways in which this can be done; and the 
obligations which go with these different ways of fulfilling civic 
duty are themselves widely different. One man may desire 
to go into politics as a most important part of the business of 
his life, with the hope of receiving elective offices and attaining 
a dominant position in the counsels of his party. Another 
may strive to influence the conduct of our public affairs in- 
directly, by his activity in behalf of civil service reform and other 
measures calculated to promote better government. A third 
may reserve his political activity for special emergencies, when 
some grave crisis, national or local, justifies him in an exceptional 
expenditure of time and strength. A fourth may content 
himself with that general influence on the conduct of political 
affairs which is exercised by every citizen who forms his moral 
judgment independently and expresses it fearlessly. One of 
these four modes of political influence each citizen should 
undertake to exercise; and, having undertaken it, he should 
adopt the methods and ideas necessary for serving the com- 
munity in this chosen way. Of course they are not mutually 
exclusive. A man who has belonged to one of these classes may 
suddenly find himself transplanted into another, almost with- 
out his own knowledge. Some grave crisis may cause the people 
to select political leaders on account of proved business ability, 
or on account of the fearlessness which they have displayed 
in some emergency, rather than through the ordinary channels 
of party influence. But in a general way the four lines of activ- 
 
-P-A-G-E-524
  502 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
ity that I have named are tolerably well distinguished from one 
another. | 
Let us take the duties of these different classes in order. 
First, what are the conditions that surround the man who thinks 
of going into politics as a profession? 
To begin with, he must be prepared to take it as seriously 
as he would take any other profession he might choose. He 
must accept it as a continuous activity. He must have the 
necessary time for so doing. He must be willing to bear the 
disagreeable features incident to the work. People are not 
going to nominate and elect men without knowing for what they 
stand, and it takes time to show for what a candidate does 
stand. A great many people talk as though the only thing that 
a man needed to do in order to convince people of his character 
was to make them a speech. This is not true. Speeches do 
not attract as many votes as is commonly supposed, because 
the people shrewdly suspect that a man may not always be 
telling the truth. He may not be what he says he is. They 
want to vote for a person who feels as they feel; and unless a man 
has certain very peculiar qualities of personal magnetism, his 
speeches give very little impression about his real feelings. 
Through newspaper articles a man can reach the voters a little 
better than through speeches, because the constant reader of a 
newspaper keeps hearing the same thing day after day until it 
comes to dominate his thoughts and emotions. But even the 
most adroitly managed newspaper is a very uncertain means of 
getting votes. I suppose that the conduct of the New York 
Journal in the last campaign represented the maximum of 
effort in this line; and the effect of the Journal in getting 
votes for Mr. Hearst was on the whole a disappointment to 
those who had the matter in charge. Personal contact of man 
with man is what attracts votes and gets offices. 
But no man in national politics, or even in state politics, 
can get into personal contact. with more than a very small 
proportion of the voters whom he wishes to influence. Here is 
where the great importance of the party machinery comes in. 
The party is a sort of hierarchy, where each of the rank and file
-P-A-G-E-525
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 503 
is looked after by the local leader; and the local leaders in turn 
are influenced by leaders of higher grade, until you come to the 
great central committee which dominates the whole. This is, 
I think, a characteristic which all efficient American party 
organizations have in common. There are different ways of 
looking after men, which range all the way in merit from educa- 
tion to corruption. But the element of personal contact is 
present in every case where anything effective gets done. It 
is customary to talk as though these party machines furnished 
opportunities to the bad man only. I am inclined to think 
that they furnish equal opportunities to the good man, pro- 
vided he is one who is ready to get acquainted with people and 
find out what they actually want: one who does not regard this 
sort of personal contact as a derogation to his dignity. Of 
course he will find corrupt men in the party councils, as he will 
in every other walk of life. He will find systems of ethics 
which are always crude, and standards of morals which are 
sometimes low. . So he will in law or in medicine, or even in 
theology. A man who is squeamish about associates should not 
go into politics, any more than a man who is squeamish about 
dogmas should go into the Church, or than a man who is squeam- 
ish about bargaining should go into certain lines of business. 
But if his natural tastes fit him for political life, he will find 
himself morally about as well off here as he could be anywhere 
else. He will have a fair chance to fight for his convictions, 
and an opportunity to make all his powers tell most effectively. 
If a man can acquire weight in the councils of a political party 
it is an invaluable asset, not only for him personally, but for the 
cause of good government in general. 
It is an asset which should not be lightly thrown away. 
The man who is in politics professionally has a right, and even a 
duty, to sacrifice much in order to preserve his influence with 
the party organization. Some people talk as though it were 
just as easy for a political leader to be independent as it is for 
the simple voter. They think that, with slight differences, 
what is good ethics for the voter is good ethics for the politician. 
With this judgment I cannot concur. The ordinary voter, by
-P-A-G-E-526
  504 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
making himself independent of party, compels the different 
parties to bid for his vote, and he does not forfeit any means of 
influence which he previously possessed. The utmost that he 
can lose will be the right to go to the caucus of the party that 
he has abandoned. But the politician who breaks with his 
party throws aside a power of reaching men and persuading 
them which control of party machinery gives, without acquiring 
any similar influence in the other party. In fact, any such 
defection on his part may lessen the strength of the better ele- 
ment in the organization opposed to him. It may be that the 
presence of a good man in the republican machine will strengthen 
the hands of the good men in the democratic machine, by com- 
pelling the democratic party leaders to adopt a higher standard 
of conduct than they would otherwise have done. It is not 
his chance of office alone, but his chance of influencing his 
associates and setting a mark for his opponents, that the poli- 
ticlan throws aside when he deserts his party. Therefore, 
if a man’s record shows that he has been honestly anxious 
to do public service, I am very slow to criticise him for stand- 
ing by his organization through a good deal that is rather 
bad. 
But if he is to retain his self-respect and the respect of his 
associates, the possibility of doing public good must be clearly 
the dominant motive. This is why certain classes of people 
have to keep out of politics as a business. Members of the 
civil service, for instance. A man who is employed by the 
people at a salary, for non-political work, will if he goes into 
politics always be under considerable suspicion as to his motives. 
Nor can a man safely make politics his occupation unless he has 
some independent means of support to fall back upon, if he 
has to break with his party. He has no right to put himself 
in a position where he may have to choose between starvation 
for his family or disservice to his country. I do not mean that 
every man who goes into politics ought to be independently 
rich (though the independently rich man does have certain 
very great advantages in leading a fight for clean politics); 
but that in default of wealth he ought to have had such training
-P-A-G-E-527
ae THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD'S WORK 505 
in law or journalism, or some other profession which he can 
readily assume, as to give him a tangible alternative to fall 
back upon if political preferment may only be had at the sacri- 
fice of his honor. Otherwise neither he nor those about him 
can be sure that the public motive is really the dominant one 
when he stands by the party. If he has not this advantage, 
and yet is anxious to do all the political service he can, he is 
far better off in our second group than in the first. 
This second group consists of those who aim to promote 
good government, not by taking political office themselves, 
but by insuring the passage and enforcement of measures that 
will raise the general character of our politics as a whole. Any 
man who undertakes this has plenty of hard work before him; 
but he does not need to abandon his regular profession, nor-to 
identify himself very closely with any one party. If he can 
suggest a law which seems likely to produce better government, 
he does not have to have party backing in order to get a hearing. 
Reform measures often find support in very surprising quarters. 
Many a politician who himself uses bad methods will encourage 
the passage, and even the enforcement, of laws to prevent the 
use of those methods in the future. The reason for this para- 
dox is not hard to find. Almost every man who goes into politics 
is anxious to leave behind him as good a record as he can. As 
he gets higher and higher up, he sees that the things that he 
has used to help himself are regarded by many people as hurtful 
to the country. He does not feel strong enough to dispense 
with these means, while his opponents in the party or outside of 
it continue to use them, because it would cost him a continuance 
of his power. But he often believes that the passage of a general 
law which takes that means out of his hands and his opponents’ 
alike will leave him a good chance to retain power and at the 
same time identify him and his party with an important meas- 
ure of public service. I do not mean that all politicians will 
think or act in this way; but there will be enough of them who 
think and act in this way to give unexpected help to the advo- 
cate of clean politics. 
The laws of this kind which we ought to have can be divided  
-P-A-G-E-528
  
506 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
into three classes: laws to prevent corruption, laws to fix re- 
sponsibility, and laws to promote independent voting. 
In the first class the best example is the civil service law. 
Many who read these words can remember a time when nearly 
the whole salary list of the government was regarded as the prey 
of spoilsmen in the game of politics. The efforts of disinterested 
men, of different parties, and some of them without definite 
party affiliations of any kind, made people see that this system 
was bad both for the efficiency of the public service and for the 
cleanness of political life as a whole. Another set of laws to 
take away the chance for corruption, not so old nor so well 
worked out as the civil service law but accepted in principle by 
most of our states, is exemplified by the secret ballot acts, 
which make it unsafe for a man to buy votes because he never 
can be quite sure that the goods will be delivered. There are 
other statutory means of preventing corruption, like laws pro- 
viding for the publicity of campaign accounts, which have hardly 
passed beyond the experimental stage. 
Of laws to fix responsibility, the best examples are seen in 
some of our newer city charters. Under the old system, where 
a mayor was surrounded by a board of aldermen which had 
large veto powers and large rights in sanctioning appointments 
to municipal office, no one could ever tell who was to blame 
for waste and inefficiency. The mayor could not give a good 
government if he tried, and therefore could not be held responsi- 
ble if his government was bad. The aldermen considered 
themselves accountable only to their supporters and friends in 
their several districts; and if the interest of the whole community 
suffered, they disclaimed responsibility for the general result. 
By giving independent powers to one man, so that he could be 
praised for good work and blamed for bad work, it was found 
not that he abused his powers, but that he sought the credit 
which resulted from exercising them as well as he knew how. 
I do not mean that we have yet found the ideal form of city 
charter. A great deal of public spirit and disinterested ser- 
vice on the part of the citizens is requisite in order to run an 
American city under any charter, however good. But we have
-P-A-G-E-529
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 507 
in many places removed the worst features of a system that 
prevailed thirty years ago, which put a positive premium on 
corruption and prevented anybody, however good or disin- 
terested, from rendering the service which he wanted to. 
A law separating the time of local and national elections is a 
good example of the kind of measure which will promote in- 
dependent voting. In municipal affairs, except perhaps in 
cities of the very largest size, there is not the same need of 
parties that there is in national affairs. Each citizen is in- 
terested to have the city’s business: well done; each citizen 
ought to know tolerably well the business capacity and character 
of men who are prominent enough to become candidates for 
municipal office. But if the municipal election is placed at the 
same time as the national election, the inevitable tendency is 
to make nominations a party matter and to let the man’s vote 
for municipal candidates be a good deal influenced by his 
preferences on the national ticket. If the local election can 
be put at an entirely different time from the national one, the 
chance for an independent ticket is infinitely greater; and if in 
addition we can devise what is known as a direct primary law, 
in which every voter belonging to a given party shall have a 
fair and equal chance to say who shall be nominated, instead 
of being compelled to work through a system of caucuses which 
gives every advantage to the professional politician, we increase 
the probability of getting businesslike nominations from the 
parties themselves. The problem of direct primaries is not 
one which has been fully worked out; and I may perhaps be 
unduly prejudiced in favor of the reform because I happen 
to have seen especially good instances of its operation. But I 
do not know any field of effort which is more promising for a man 
who wants to do political service, and who has not the time or 
inclination to go into politics, than the development of the 
direct primary, or of some similar means’ which will give the 
average voter the best chance of expressing his views before 
the nomination. 
It has been found much harder to separate state issues 
from national ones. The state is so large that people cannot
-P-A-G-E-530
  508 COLLEGE LIFE, 1a CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
know a man’s probable fitness to be governor as they can know 
his probable fitness to be mayor. But I believe that we ought 
to try to do for our states what we have done for our cities, by 
removing all artificial attempts to tie local and national issues 
together. This is why I favor direct election of United States 
senators by the people. It is not because we send specially 
bad men to Washington under the present system. It is not 
because of the effect of the present system on the character 
and composition of the senate. It is because of the effect of 
the present system on the character and composition of the 
state legislatures. A man is sent to the state capital to make 
some laws for the people of his state; and he finds that his first 
duty—in some sessions almost his only duty—is to elect a 
United States senator. A more direct means of preventing the 
elector from getting the kind of local laws which he wants could 
not possibly be devised. He is in a large number of cases com- 
pelled to vote either for a representative who will make the 
kind of laws he wants for the state but will send the wrong man 
to the United States Senate, or for one who will make the kind 
of laws he does not want for the state but will send the right 
man to the United States Senate. He generally chooses the 
latter; and that is one of the reasons why the politics of many of 
our states are so bad. People are not allowed to elect state 
officers on the basis of state issues. 
It is hardly worth while to multiply instances of statutory 
changes which would promote cleaner politics. While we cannot 
make men good by Act of Congress or General Assembly, we 
can make it either a great deal easier or a great deal harder for 
a good man to do what he wants. The man who succeeds in 
making it easier does just as much public service and has just 
as honorable a political career as if he had himself taken office 
or been identified with the actual government of the country. 
And of equal importance with the work of the man who secures 
the passage of new laws of the right sort is that of the man who 
helps systematically toward the better enforcement and more 
intelligent administration of the laws which we have already. 
The work of a man like Judge Lindsey in the Juvenile Court of
-P-A-G-E-531
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 500 
Denver is in no sense political; but it would be hard to find any 
one in the whole country whose professional career has had 
more to do with the improvement of politics and of government 
than has Judge Lindsey through the effects, direct and in- 
direct, of his Juvenile Court. 
The duty of the third class that I have named—the men who 
feel that they can take up politics only in grave emergencies 
—requires very little comment. A nation, like an army, needs 
a strong reserve; and if a man cannot be in the front rank all 
the time, he does good work by accomplishing all he can when 
the reserves are called out. A man in such a position has this 
special advantage, that, not being bound by party affiliations, 
he is freer to make his choice, and to let people see that it is an 
unbiassed choice, in times when party lines have broken up. 
For leadership in a tremendous uprising of the whole people, 
it is sometimes an advantage not to have been habitually re- 
garded as the representative of a particular party. And even 
when such a leader is turned out of office, as he is likely to be 
before very long, he can have the satisfaction of thinking 
that he has left behind him a larger sum of permanent results 
that his followers in the first flush of their disappointment are 
willing to see. No city which has become thoroughly reformed, 
even for a brief time, ever gets back to practices quite as bad as 
whose which it once had. The forces that overthrew Tweed 
in New York had a comparatively brief period of success; 
but no body of New York officeholders has ever again dared to 
do the things that Tweed and his friends did, or anything like 
them, The reformers who obtained control of many of our 
cities a year or two ago are inclined to be discouraged at the 
reaction which seems to be taking the fruits of victory out of 
their hands. But that reaction, at its worst, is not likely to 
carry people back to the point where they were when the re- 
form movement started. 
We are in perpetual danger of overestimating the power of a 
great moral uprising to change the face of our politics, and of 
being unduly disappointed because these impossible hopes do 
not turn out realities. It seems to most people as if a great
-P-A-G-E-532
  gio COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
wave of public sentiment, which unites the good and even the 
indifferently good of all classes and parties, ought of itself to 
establish a permanent government too strong to be overthrown 
by politicians. It seems as though the public interests in favor 
of such a movement were so large, and the private interests 
opposed to it so small, that the contest between the two could 
be left to take care of itself. But we all know the comment 
of the man who, when he was told that God was stronger than 
the devil, objected that the devil made up for his inferior 
strength by his superior activity. We can hardly expect the 
leaders of a reform movement, who go into the work at the sacri- 
fice of their regular business, to maintain year after year the 
continued activity which is characteristic of the successful 
politician. Still less can we expect it of their followers. A 
thousand details which an organized party machine would look 
after are left unheeded. Want of attention to these details 
alienates some supporters of the movement, and sets others at 
cross purposes. The underlying principles on which the 
reformers started remain as important as ever; but the mis- 
management of the details distracts attention from these prin- 
ciples until people are willing to sacrifice some of them for the 
sake of having the government more smoothly run. “Will 
he not fail me in a great moral crisis?” asks the heroine in a 
recent story of her married sister, who is urging her to accept 
a match which seems somewhat advantageous. And the reply 
is, “I cannot say; but he has good manners at his meals. I do 
not think we have ever had a great moral crisis in our family; 
and you have to eat meals three times a day.” There always 
will be some idealists in politics to whom the possibility of a 
~ great moral crisis is more important than the meals three times 
a day. These men are to be encouraged. We are never 
likely to-have too many of them. But they will not generally 
get elected to office. Most of the time their work will be that 
of critics. Only in emergencies will they be called upon for 
constructive leadership; but what they can do then makes up 
for all their disappointments and failures at other times. 
There is apt to be a misunderstanding, and a most unwise
-P-A-G-E-533
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 51r 
misunderstanding, between the emergency worker and the man 
regularly connected with politics. The former regards the latter 
as hidebound. The latter regards the former as unpractical. 
But each is necessary in the fight for clean politics; and I may 
add that each is necessary for the usefulness of the other. A 
friend of mine said to me, not so very long ago: “I know 
President Roosevelt so well that I can tell him the truth; and 
I say to him, ‘The trouble with you is that you are narrow- 
minded. You don’t like the New York Evening Post. You 
don’t see that the Evening Post is necessary to make people 
accept you as the less of two evils.’ ” 
And now we come to our fourth group, which after all must 
be the largest influence in the politics of the country—the people 
who do not aspire to leadership, regular or even occasional, 
but whose votes and opinions and moral judgments make the 
country what it is. What obligation should be emphasized 
in their code of political ethics? What can they do for good 
public morals? 
First, they can vote independently. The reasons which 
prevent the politician from always speaking his mind on a 
doubtful issue do not apply in the case of the ordinary citizen. 
He is bound by no set of obligations to the party with which 
he may have been associated. He has no highly organized 
influence, built up through a series of years, which he casts 
aside by breaking over party lines. I do not mean that the 
voter should try to defeat a party with whose aims he is in 
general sympathy, merely because of one man whom he dis- 
likes or one measure which he disapproves. He must consider 
carefully the arguments which can be urged on both sides. 
But having taken those arguments into consideration, he ought 
to be guided by his reason and not by his inertia. Parties are 
likely to be so nearly even in numbers that many elections will 
be decided by two comparatively small groups of men: the 
corrupt and the intelligent. If the intelligent men stand by 
their party instead of voting independently, it will be more 
desirable for the party leaders to appeal to the corrupt vote 
by lowering the standards of their platforms and promises 
 
-P-A-G-E-534
  512. COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
than to appeal to the intelligent vote by raising the standard of 
those platforms and promises. But if the intelligent men are 
also independent, the chances are that it will be more necessary 
to bid for the intelligent vote than for the corrupt vote. The 
leaders will have every incentive to do better instead of doing 
worse. The man who, having sense enough to find out what is 
right, does not take the trouble to do it, or does not have the 
courage to act on his convictions, is throwing away an influence 
which is absolutely necessary for the promotion of good politics. 
But the American citizen has a yet broader duty than this. 
It is not enough to vote rightly on certain specific issues, or to 
enforce right ideas on certain specific questions of politics and 
morals. We must get our minds themselves into a judicial 
attitude. Under the American Constitution the people of our 
country are encouraged to judge of facts, to take charge of the 
enforcement of the law, and to select leaders of the kind that they 
admire. The final test of our ability as a nation rests on the 
power of our people to judge of evidence quietly; to accept the 
operations of law, even when it works to their own hurt; to get 
ideals of success of the kind that will preserve the nation in- 
stead of those which will destroy it. Every man who publishes 
a newspaper which appeals to the emotions rather than to the 
intelligence of its readers, and to a less extent every man who 
lightly believes the statements that he finds in such a news- 
paper, attacks our political life at a most vulnerable point. 
Every man, whether a member of the majority or of the minor- 
ity, who regards the law as an enactment to promote one set 
of private institutions at the expense of another, or who coéper- 
ates in the passage and administration of laws in this spirit, 
makes himself responsible for the dangers of growing contempt 
of law. Every man who admires a public officer for success 
in serving himself rather than for success in serving others— 
who respects the man for getting the office rather than for 
deserving the office—shows himself to that extent unfit to be 
a member of a self-governing nation, and by influence and ex- 
ample diminishes the capacity of the nation as a whole for self- 
government. These are the fundamental points of political  
-P-A-G-E-535
  THE COLLEGE MAN IN THE WORLD’S WORK 513 
ethics—these the fundamental issues in all questions of public 
morals.. 
For the great political question before us is not whether 
this or that party shall be kept in power, or whether one law 
or another shall be passed. The question is rather whether our 
present system of government shall stand. The history of the 
world shows that freedom is a very precarious possession, which 
a nation cannot continue to enjoy for many centuries unless 
it uses it with exceptional wisdom. If people will employ 
liberty as a means of substituting self-control for external con- 
trol, they can continue to have it. If they try to make it a 
pretext for getting rid of all control except that which is fur- 
nished by their own desires and whims and wishes, it is taken 
away by force of circumstances. The Athenian democracy, 
when it was composed of men trained in the habits of self-com- 
mand, furnished a magnificent instance of what freedom can do 
in government and in morals, in art and in literature. But the 
children and grandchildren of the. men who made Athens 
great could not endure the discipline which their fathers volun- 
tarily accepted. By defiance of the law and by the pursuit of 
individual selfishness they brought the state to its fall. The 
Roman freedom lasted longer than the Athenian, because the 
Romans had been trained in a sterner discipline, and had a 
respect for law which stood them in good stead for generations. 
But when freedom became a pretext for selfishness, Rome in its 
turn fell, first under the tyranny of the emperors, and later 
under the yoke of the barbarian. 
I am no pessimist. I do not see anything which warrants 
the fear that we shall repeat in the near future the experience 
of Athens or Rome—unless it be the mistaken complacency of 
those optimists who think that we can repeat the mistakes of 
Athens and Rome without incurring the penalties. But the 
danger is great enough to make it worth while to impress upon 
every citizen the duty of inculcating respect for law, even when 
that law hurts him. It is the underlying spirit of philosophical 
selfishness which is the chief element of danger—the theory 
that if each man does what he really wants to do, things will
-P-A-G-E-536
  514 COLLEGE LIFE, ITS CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS 
all go well. Every nation that has accepted this philosophy 
has begun to ride to its own destruction. I do not know what 
is the solution of the divorce problem. IwishI did. But I do 
know that the worst thing about divorce at present is that so 
many people regard marriage as a thing to be made and unmade 
for purely selfish reasons; and when this conception fully takes 
root, the days of a nation are numbered. I do not know what 
is the means of doing away with lynch law. IwishI did. But 
I do know that the most serious aspect of all the lynchings of 
which we hear, North or South, is the evidence of weakened 
authority of legal procedure, when brought face to face with the 
preconceptions and passions of the crowd. When any nation 
looks upon law as a thing which the individual may use when 
it suits him and evade or defy when it Poe suit him, that 
nation is losing the main bulwarks of social order. To any man, 
whatever his position in the state, it has become the paramount 
political duty to defend the sacredness of law, not only against 
the active assaults which threaten to overthrow it, but against 
the more subtle and dangerous attacks of a selfish philosophy 
which works to undermine it. He must regard, and must 
persuade others to regard, liberty and the privileges which 
go with it as trusts to be used only in the public interest, and 
in behalf of the nation as a whole.

far as possible, application of a topic should be made to the student’s 
personal experience or to the individual college. 
Some instructors might prefer to have all the selections of a divi-

this case, this list will afford a convenient means of finding subjects. 
Instructors who prefer to have the writing follow each selection will 
find that the groupings of subjects indicated by the Roman numerals 
will afford a ready guide to their connection with the selections, in a

  REFERENCE BOOKS 
The list of reference books given below makes no pretension tu being 
a complete bibliography to the problems of college life, but is simply 
a list of books, useful as aids in various ways in a course in this field, 
which ‘the average college library will have, or can easily obtain. 
No account has been taken of the many important articles in this 
field which are.to be found in the magazines, as these can easily be 
found through The Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature and Poole’s 
Index to Periodical Literature. Much valuable material is also to be 
had from histories and books descriptive of individual colleges, from 
annual reports of college presidents and deans, and from published 
proceedings of educational associations.

Expository Writing 
Materials for a College Course in Exposition by Analysis and 
Imitation 
Compiled and Edited, with Questions and Exercises, by 
MAURICE GARLAND FULTON 
Professor of English in Davidson College 
Cloth, 12mo, 555 pages, $1.40 
EXTRACTS FROM PREFACE 
In preparing this book of selections illustrative of some of the various 
phases of expository writing, for use either in the general Fresaman course 
in English composition or in a special course in exposition to be taken in 
the Sophomore or Junior year, I have had in mind certain definite aims, 
the principal of which are the following: First, to make definite and sys- 
tematic application of the method of learning to write through the exami- 
nation and imitation of good models. Second, to center attention upon 
exposition, since it is the kind of writing that is most directly serviceable in 
practical life and that most readily exemplifies the essential qualities of 
effective composition—accuracy, logicalness, and economy of presentation. 
Third, to draw the selections chiefly from the field of scientific writing, 
because of the intrinsic interest of such subject-matter to young persons. 
Fourth, to have the selections of such length that the analysis of them will 
afford a “severe logical setting-up exercise.” 
This book aims to give material for conducting a course in composition 
by the method of analysis and imitation. No attempt has been made to 
teach systematic rhetoric. The purpose has been the simple one of opening 
in a practical way the student’s eye to some of the major problems of writing. 
The selections presented are complete articles, chapters, or other large 
component parts of books, rather than excerpts of a few paragraphs, in 
order that the study of them may afford training in the power to think 
straight, which is so little a part of the rising generation. In few ways can 
the strengthening and developing of the thinking power be more readily 
secured than by the careful analysis of expository selections. Hence, the 
selections in this book are of greater length than is usual in similar volumes.

  The Theory and Practice of Argumentation and 
Peoee 
VICTOR ALVIN KETCHAM, B.A., LL.B. Assistant Professor of English in the Ohio State University

FROM THE. PREFACE 
The object of this book is to furnish practical directions for the prepara- 
tion and presentation of oral and written arguments. 
The order in which the subjects are discussed is that dictated by actual 
practice. The object has been to lead the student step by step, to point 
out all the difficulties along the way, and to show by precept and example 
how they may be overcome. After the essential definitions are given and 
the importance of the subject upon which he is entering is set forth, the stu- 
dent is shown where to find, and how to choose and express, a proposition 
for argument. He is then directed how to analyze that proposition 
for the purpose of finding out what he must do in order to establish its truth 
or falsity. Next, he is informed of the sources of evidence bearing upon the 
proposition, and how such evidence is to be collected and used. Directions 
for constructing a brief out of this evidence are then presented and the way 
in which the finished argument is to be developed is set forth. The psycho- 
logical development of an argument is here for the first time given full 
consideration. Following this the student is shown how to defend his own 
argument and overthrow that of his opponent. Finally, instructions are 
given for delivering the argument in the most effective manner. Even with- 
out the aid of an instructor the student could follow the argumentative 
process through to the end. 
The exercises given are intended to be practical and to assure a thorough 
working knowledge of the discussion.

.. After a brief introductory chapter dealing with exposition in general, 
there are discussed the several types of exposition, such as définition, 
analysis, expository description, the familiar essay and criticism, in such a 
manner that the student may acquire by induction a broad comprehension 
of the subject as a whole. Each chapter consists of a brief body of doctrine 
on the special expository form there treated, followed by a specimen of 
illustrative and of intrinsic value. The book may be used as a text in 
Freshman courses, but it is more particularly designed for use in a course on 
exposition which follows the general Freshman course.

  Great American Universities By 
EDWIN S. SLOSSON 
Illustrated, Cloth, 8v0, $2.50 postage extra 
This is no ordinary book of preconceived opinions and theoretical state- 
ments of what our American universities are or should be, but is instead a 
frank and entirely unprejudiced presentation of practical information 
gained at first hand. Information which was gathered from personal ob- 
servation and investigation by an exceedingly keen-sighted and clear- 
thinking man, during actual visits at fourteen of the United States largest 
universities. 
There is a freshness and vivacity about Mr. Slosson’s writing which 
one cannot fail to appreciate, even when perchance he is criticising the pet 
hobby of one’s own Alma Mater. For the author is absolutely free and 
fearless in expressing his opinion, though in the main his estimations are 
singularly just and true. He seems to possess an almost unerring instinct 
for seizing upon the most distinctive and significant features of each of the 
universities visited, whether the distinction be that of policy, of architecture 
or of the student body. 
The book abounds in epigrammatic sentences, so clear-cut and incisive 
that they persistently linger in the memory, even of those who have little 
or no interest in educational institutions. 
The wealth of information and up-to-date statistics contained in the 
volume makes it invaluable as a work of reference. The vivid descriptions 
of the buildings and grounds, supplemented by innumerable excellent illus- 
trations, will make the book desired by all who have even a remote interest 
‘in any of the universities included.

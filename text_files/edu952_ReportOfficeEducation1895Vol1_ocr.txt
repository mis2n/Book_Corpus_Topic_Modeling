  XIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
AVERAGE AMOUNT OF SCHOOLING PER INHABITANT. 
It is useful to state the above results in another form to answer the 
questions, How much’ schooling is each inhabitant receiving on the 
basis of present attendance? If the conditions existing the past year 
were continued indefinitely, what would be the average amount of 
schooling per individual, counting it in school years of 200 days each? 
In answer to this inquiry, the average for the nation and its five census 
divisions is given, estimated in Table 2 for the common schools alone, 
and in Table 1, including also the higher education and the private 
schools. The results are shown in comparative form, beginning with 
1870: 
Average total amount of schooling (including all grades of both public and private schools) 
each individual of the population would receive under the conditions actually existing at 
the different dates given below.

GRAPHIC EXHIBIT OF SCHOOL STATISTICS. 
The following nine graphic views have been prepared! to show at a 
glance the trend of the chief items of educational statistics. Especial 
attention is called to diagrams 6 and 7, and to the note (a) explaining the 
change in methods of counting the secondary enrollment after 1889. 
Also see note (b), which explains the sudden increase in public high- 
school enrollment by counting not merely those in cities, but all others. 
In diagrams 8 and 9 the rapid increase after 1888is in part due to the 
adoption of coeducation in the colleges for men and the establishment 
of women’s colleges.

CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
According to the Eleventh Census, between 1880 and 1890 there was 
an annual increase of 2.2 per cent in the population of the United 
States as a whole, while the cities grew more rapidly, attaining the 
rate of 4.8 per cent perannum. ‘This gain on the part of the cities has 
asignificance in educational affairs; the problems of city school organ- 
ization and management are the most important with which we have 
to deal. 
The statistics of enrollment presented in this report (Chapter 
XXXVI) show that there has been no change in the tendency of urban. 
growth since 1890, for while the school enroll- 
ment in the country at large shows an average 
annual growth of 2.1 per cent, the city schools 
have grown at the rate of 5.8 per cent; 24.2 
per cent of the entire enrollment is in cities of 
over 8,000 inhabitants, as against 20.1 per cent PX 1870-71

Naturally during such rapid expansion the 
question of organization becomes of prime im- 1s   
portance. The actual instruction given is the 
ultimate objective point toward which all ques- 
tions of organization must look. All discussion ye 
that relates to school boards, supervision, equip- 
ment, cost, and such items must have as its final 
object the efficiency of the teacher and of his 
work. But the question of maintaining and   
SCENTS.   
        improving the quality of the teaching has become } 
exceedingly complex as cities have grown in size, —_ Dracram 5.—Showing the 
and many subsidiary questions are involved that amount expended on

no longer of secondary consideration, but mat- personal property. 
ters of prime importance in themselves. The 
selection of members of the school board, the raising of school revenue, 
the appointment of the superintendent, the choice of teachers, the 
construction of buildings, all these involve vital questions, the success- 
ful solution of which is the condition precedent upon which effective 
work in the school depends. 
The size of schoolrooms as affecting discipline—One of the items of 
school management which came under the notice of the earliest super- 
visors of city schools was the size of the room and number of pupils 
assigned to the charge of the teacher. The Bell and Lancaster system 
of monitorial education had brought into use in the cities of the North 
Atlantic States the plan of school building that furnished a large assem- 
bly room in which the pupils sat while engaged in their studies. The 
head master presided over this room and “kept order.” The general
-P-A-G-E-20
    xX REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
exercises also were held in this room, but for the majority of recitations 
the pupils passed into small adjoining rooms, presided over by assist- 
ant teachers. In the Lancasterian or monitorial system these assist- 
ants were pupil teachers. 
The first departure from this style of building seems to have been 
the Quincy School in Boston, completed in 1847 and placed under the 
charge of John D. Philbrick, who became afterwards distinguished as 
the superintendent of the Boston schools and an eminent authority in 
American education. 
The best building for the graded school, officered by professionally 
trained teachers, was then and there discovered. It furnished the 
model for the school buildings in the cities of the Northwestern States. 
Primary pupils and grammar pupils were collected in one building.'! 
Instead of a large study room, with small recitation rooms opening out 
from it, in the Quincy School there were twelve separate rooms intended 
to be occupied each by a single teacher, who was to have charge of the 
discipline of the pupils while studying, as well as of the classes when 
reciting. 
This point in regard to architecture is by all means the most important 
item in the whole plan of organization. Instead of a small room, 28 by 
32 feet and holding 56 pupils, make a large room holding 150 pupils 
and the entire morale of the school will be changed. While a humane, 
self-controlled teacher can easily manage the small room and secure 
excellent discipline with very little or no corporal punishment, it requires 
a person of strong gifts in the direction of discipline—so strong, indeed, 
as to overbalance his other qualities—to control and discipline the large 
room. The tendency of the school system with the large room is con- 
stantly toward the employment of bullies and tyrants as head masters. 
The influence of the whole school then goes toward military discipline 
sustained by brute force. In the St. Louis schools in 1858, where the 
large-room plan prevailed, it was not uncommon for over 100 cases of 
corporal punishment to take place in one day in a school building con- 
taining less than 500 pupils. 
The pupils in the small rooms remain under the discipline of the 
same teacher, both in recitation and in study, and teacher and pupil 
come to know each other and to feel an intimate sympathy, whereas 
in the large-room system the number of pupils prevents intimate 
acquaintance on the part of the head master, who is responsible for the 
discipline. The constant danger of demoralization renders summary 
measures indispensable. Every case of misbehavior attracts the atten- 
tion of 150 pupils. The teacher can have very little power to hold so 
many pupils in subordination by the influence of his eye and voice. In 
the small room a case of misbehavior disturbs only 50 pupils, and the   
  
1I quote here a discussion of the meaning of this departure in school architecture 
from my contribution to the volume, A Memorial of the Life and Services of John D. 
Philbrick, Boston. New England Publishing Company, 1887.
-P-A-G-E-21
          CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS XxI 
teacher easily holds the room under control by a mere look or a mere 
word. 
In the system of schools of St. Louis, after the adoption of the Boston 
style of building, corporal punishment decreased in ten years from an 
average of 500 cases per week for 700 pupils to 3 cases for that number. 
The benefit to the schools of the central plain of the United States from 
this architectural innovation of Boston may be estimated by this. But 
another benefit of almost equal magnitude arose from the close grading 
of classes which the new system produced. I think that Mr. Philbrick 
alone deserves the eredit for most of this latter improvement.. The 
large school was graded into classes from the lowest to the highest, so 
as to bring together in each room only those of the same grade of 
advancement in their studies. According to the ungraded system, such 
as exists in small country schools now, each teacher had pupils of all 
grades, from those just beginning to read up to those studying algebra 
and perhaps Latin. Twenty-five pupils in the country school admit of 
classification into divisions of 2 or 3 pupils at most, and the result is 
forty recitations for the day’s work and five or ten minutes to each 
recitation. It is obvious that. no thorough work can be done on this 
plan; no searching analysis of the recitation, no discussion of the 
thought, no experiments to illustrate it—nothing but mere committing 
to memory and repeating the words by rote—no explanation of the 
process of an arithmetical problem, but only a memorizing of the rule 
and an inspection of the figures in which the answer is stated. The 
ungraded school in which this method of procedure did not prevail was 
a rare phenomenon. 
In the graded school eaeh teacher has two classes. One recites while 
the other learns its lesson. The recitation is as long as the attention 
of the pupil can be held without overstrain—twenty to twenty-five min- 
utes in the lower grades and thirty to forty minutes in the highest classes 
of the grammar school. Time is given for review of the previous lesson, 
for investigation of the lesson for the day, for discussion of authorities, 
for illustrations, for hints as to methods of study. Each pupil prepares 
himself by study of the text-book, and in the recitation sees the subject 
through the perspective of the minds of his fellow-pupils and teacher, 
thus widening his own narrow views of the subject by seeing what 
different aspects it takes on in the minds of his fellow-pupils. He 
acquires critical alertness by this process and goes to his next lesson 
with his mind full of new inquiry and reflection, thus reenforcing his 
own power of attention by what he has learned from the whole class 
and the teacher. A good teacher can and does use the recitation as an 
instrumentality for reenforcing each individual mind by all the minds 
of the whole class. ; 
The constant influence, therefore, of the graded school system of Bos- 
ton has been to change the memoriter system of recitation into a system 
of critical investigation. Such asystem is not possible in an ungraded

with poor teachers, even in a graded system, yet they are no longer 
necessary, and experience tends to eradicate them altogether. 
CITY SCHOOL SUPERVISION. 
   The functions of the office of the superintendent of public schools 
have become better defined from year to year. They included at first 
functions as widely diverse as janitor work and the formulation of a 
course of study. One after another have been eliminated—the mechan- 
ical elements of curatorship, purchasing supplies, keeping records, 
supervising the construction of buildings. Finally the superintendent 
has arrived at the work of the educational expert and confines himself 
more and more to directing the course of study, teaching methods of 
instruction, inspiring the teachers with the spirit of selfculture, acting 
as counselor and advisor of the school board or school committee, and 
fashioning or shaping the educational thought of the community. But 
still the work of the superintendent must include at least a directive 
oversight in those mechanical spheres, and a mere theoretic superin- 
tendent who confines himself exclusively to examining pupils and dis- 
cussing methods of instruction and discipline would prove a failure. 
He may reasonably be relieved of the mechanical drudgery, but he 
should retain the supervisory control over its performance. Heating, 
ventilating, sewerage, lighting, cleaning—all these things must be under 
his control in the last resort, although their routine may be managed 
by an independent officer of the board. The construction of school 
buildings requires at every step the advice of an expert in educational 
methods. 
The superintendent, too, must prescribe what statistics are to be 
kept, for he is the one to know what is essential to indicate the charac- 
ter of the management and the needs and necessities of reform or 
change. Of course, too, the financial concerns of the schools, the grades 
of salaries, the cost of apparatus and incidental supplies should have 
the superintendent’s consideration, no matter how efficient the school 
board committee may be; for the excellence of the school is condi- 
tioned largely by teacher’s wages and by the apparatus of the school- 
room. 
These inechanical and financial essentials being once provided for, 
the superintendent in the capacity of educational expert has to do with 
teachers, pupils, parents, the school board, and with the community at 
large. 
The average school board (or “school committee,” as called in some 
of the Atlantic States) may be said to have three classes of men repre- 
sented in its composition: First, the business man, chosen from the 
class of merchants, teachers, manufacturers, or professionals who have 
no personal ends to serve and no special cause to foster or protect other 
than the general efficiency and business management of the schools.
-P-A-G-E-23
   CITY SCHOOL SUPERVISION. XXIII      
      Second, there are the men representing the element of reform or change, 
and who have some pet scheme that they wish to introduce. These 
men are honest and well-meaning, but their enthusiasm is prone to 
unbalance their judgment regarding educational values. They become 
so much impressed with the importance of their pet schemes that they 
can not see the true significance of the studies already in the course. 
A third class of men that gets represented on a school board is the self- 
seeking or ambitious men who have political ends to accomplish, for 
which they are willing to sacrifice to some degree the efficiency of the 
schools. This element usually enters the board as a result of partisan 
politics and varies in its amount according to the influence of polities 
in the government of the schools. There may be in this third quota of 
the board some who seek higher political offices, a seat in the town 
council, the State legislature or Congress, and who will aim at noto- 
riety by their actions in the school board; others, a few, will perhaps seek 
profitable contracts for their friends. 
Now the superintendent will find the first class, the conservative 
business men, his best support in his administration. He will find the 
third element untrustworthy for his support in any measure for the 
public good. It is the second element of the board, composed of 
honest but unbalanced men, that he must study carefully and endeavor 
by all upright means to educate into broader views. He must labor to 
unite the first and second quotas of his board, the business men with 
the men of reform. There. is in every board a natural antipathy 
between the honest business man and the honest reformer. The busi- 
ness man is apt to regard the latter as a visionary. But the balance 
of power in the board is quite often in the hands of the latter class. 
it is sure to be the case sooner or later in the vicissitudes of municipal 
politics. 
The discontented, the critical, the opinionated in matters of school 
management have to be approached often by the superintendent and 
their statements heard with patience, their arguments turned over and 
over with faimnindedness. If there is to be any progress in the school 
system it is to come in by their proposed reforms. The superintendent 
therefore must learn to see what elements of the proposed measures he 
can adopt after freeing them from all features of danger to the schools’ 
best interest. He must study to make a. synthesis of many of these 
points severally proposed by the reformers on the board. He must 
above all endeavor to make the members of the second quota of the 
board conscious of the educational value and bearing of what already 
belongs to the course of study. He can in some cases show that the 
main object sought by the proposed reform is already met by the course 
of study as it is. 
The superintendent in his endeavor to educate the one-sided school 
directors will educate himself into all-sidedness if he is always careful 
to be true and honest in his dealings with these men. If he yields to

   the temptation to play the demagogue with them, his course will prove 
fatal to himself and disastrous to his cause, no matter how good it is 
nor how great his temporary victory. 
Hence in this dangerous and difficult part of his duties the superin- 
tendent must go no faster than he can see his way with perfect frank- 
ness and honesty. He must espouse sincerely so much of the proposed 
reform as he finds salutary to the school system under his charge. This 
policy will lead to a slow and beneficial change in the educational sys- 
tem and to thé addition of features which will prove permanent ele- 
ments of strength and perfection. 
itis difficult to lift this policy of the superintendent on to a plane so 
high as to exclude all taint of demagoguery, and it should not be 
attempted by one who can not hospitably entertain ideas radically dif 
ferent from his own, and turn them over and over earnestly seeking 
their good sides. 
The superintendent who is not disposed to make any further progress, 
nor to admit any changes into the school system under his charge, will 
side with the conservative business men on his board and allow the 
reformers and discontented members to go without his sympathy or 
attention. The ultimate consequence of this will be a combination of 
the second and third quotas of the board—the reformers and the self- 
seekers. If the well-balanced conservative members do not keep in 
their party the honest but discontented members, the latter will get 
under the power of the less scrupulous members, and the consequence 
will be revolution instead of reform, for the third quota of members 
of the board are willing to yield to the reformers anything in the line 
of theoretical doctrine or educational practice provided they can get 
for themselves political consequence. 
The highest type of superintendent is therefore the one who has gen- 
uine political skill—the skill to correct and persuade mistaken men 
and combine them harmoniously with the honest business men in 
behalf of good and wise measures. If his skill is not sufficient to per- 
form this without deceit and demagoguery, it is not genuine political 
skill but a piece of political corruption not to be justified by any tem- 
porary success in defending a good cause. 
The superintendent of the most advanced type, in his relations with 
his teachers, aims to organize them into a body of investigators of the 
history and practice of education.. He should do one kind of work with 
his principals and another kind of work with the teachers at large, 
meeting them in classes or in assemblies for this purpose. He should 
discuss with the principals such questions as those relating to the 
proper selection of the branches of the course of study; exactly what 
each branch contributes to the intellectual development; how each 
should be taught; what should be the manner, form, and spirit of the 
discipline; what new experiments in teaching have been recently pro- 
posed in the city or elsewhere, and what their merits.
-P-A-G-E-25
     CITY SCHOOL SUPERVISION. XXV 
          he superintendent will perhaps do a still more valuable work by 
inspiring his teachers to form literary societies for the study of the 
great world poets—Dante, Shakespeare, Homer, Goethe, and the lesser 
lights. There is no field more important for the teacher to enter than 
the field of esthetic culture—the study of the great works of art in 
sculpture, architecture, painting, and music, as well as in poesy. 
The teacher is exposed to a certain paralyzing influence arising from 
the necessity of his vocation which places him in a position wherein he 
must keep a constant pull against the arbitrariness and caprice of the 
child. This produces what has somewhere been called the “‘ pedagogical 
cramp.” There is no cure for this equal to the study of literature and 
art. Hence the importance which the good superintendent will give to 
the encouragement, by precept and example, of such studies on the 
part of his teachers. The superintendent should be fertile in devices 
which work silently and gradually toward improving the iethod of 
instruction or the method of discipline. Take for example a device 
having the twofold effect of rendering the discipline in the schoolroom 
mild and free from petulance while at the same time correcting the 
pupil’s waywardness or negligence, and, besides these good effects, 
superadding a wholesome influence on the parent. This device is the 
suspension of the pupil for repeated and inexcusable absence or tardi- 
ness, or for persistent and willful violation of the order of the school. 
The suspended pupil can not return without a permit from the superin- 
tendent, and to obtain this the parent must visit him at his office hour. 
This affords occasion for a friendly comparison of views between the 
superintendent and the parent regarding the whole case. If the parent 
cherishes ill-feeling toward the teacher, the superintendent suggests a 
transfer of the pupil to another teacher out of the district. A transfer 
usually works a complete cure of these cases of brittle temper or blame- 
worthy negligence. About two in a hundred will need another transfer 
to complete the cure. The teacher, it was quite possible, had not shown 
sufficient patience and had done something to justify the parent’s ill- 
feeling. The transfer contains in it sometimes a gentle suggestion to 
the teacher to correct his or her own petulance; frequent transfers are 
sure to be understood clearly in this light. 
There collect in many school districts discontented critics of the 
school management who object strongly to the rigid district system; 
but this system of transfers is the best means of removing the cause of 
this unpopularity of the schools. 
Another device very effectual in strengthening the novitiate teacher 
in her power of governing a school is the practice of placing teachers 
weak in discipline on the “substitute” list and letting them fill vacan- 
cies here and there as they occur through the temporary absence of 
the regular teacher. “Teachers who had become chronic failures in dis- 
cipline have been entirely reformed by a few weeks of such experience. 
The first-class superintendent is a sort of pilot for the whole system,

   and must watch the rocks and breakers and the winds and clouds of 
public opinion and ascertain the drift of his course. The educational 
journals give him the trend of education elsewhere. He has to direct 
his own labors and the labors of all his teachers toward making their 
schools strong in the community. First, the teachers must do good 
work, and second they must make the community feel that it is good 
work. To neglect public opinion in a representative government is to 
rebel against it and court defeat and discomfiture. The teachers must 
not do anything except what they conscientiously believe to be right. 
But it is their duty to show to their clients, the people, the grounds of 
their convictions and the efficiency of their work. 
The efficient superintendent therefore sets into working order these 
educative influences to support the one great work of education in 
the school system, namely, an educative influence for the members of the 
school board leading toward correct insight and the adoption of wise 
measures; second, an educative influence resulting in the acquisition 
of good methods, a growth in personal self-control, aud, besides these, 
progressive studies in literature, art, and science; third, for the com- 
munity an enlightened public opinion, which knows what the schools 
are actually doing and can intelligently explain their merits and defects, 
and tell what changes are desirable for onward progress.      
                     
            
                
               
   
                       
   
   
           CONSTITUTION. AND POWERS OF CITY SCHOOL BOARDS. 
The plans that have been devised for the treatment of matters of 
organization have not all been equally successful in meeting the con- 
ditions incident to rapid urban growth, and there is a general inquiry 
for means of betterment and a demand for data concerning the organ-— 
ization of other systems. 
The structure of the city school system is determined as a rule by 
the respective State legislatures, though in some cases that power has 
been delegated to the general government of the city. 
In Chapter I, pp. 3-78, are set forth the legal provisions concerning 
the systems of 23 cities selected to show the principal types of organi- 
zation that exist in this country. A discussion of these types precedes 
the detailed description, and at the end of the chapter is a convenient 
epitome, in tabular form, of the laws mentioned. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
In diagram No. 6 and the accompanying table (p. XXTx) a condensed 
statement of the progress of secondary instruetion for twenty-five years 
is given and illustrated graphically. Up to 1887 the number of second- 
x ary pupils (in ninth to twelfth years of course of study) in private 
academies and preparatory schools exceeded those in the public high 
schools. In 1895 the public high schools enrolled 350,099, while the 
private academies and preparatory schools enrolled only 118,347. But
-P-A-G-E-27
SECONDARY SCHOOLS, XXVIL 
these were all pupils in the secondary course of study. In 1871, and 
for nearly twenty years thereafter, such schools reported their entire 
enrollment as secondary pupils, although the larger proportion were 
really pursuing elementary studies. In 1887 the Bureau of Education 
began to collect information as to the actual numbers in each of the 
several branches of secondary study, such as algebra, Latin, physical 
geography, geometry, general history, natural philosophy (or physics), 
chemistry, French, Greek, etc. By 1890 it became possible to separate 
completely the secondary from the elementary pupils. The statistician 
has accordingly revised the returns of enrollment for the years 1871 
to 1889 on the basis of the data furnished since 1890. 
Before 1890 the public high schools outside of cities were not tabu- 
lated. Since that date those in rural districts have been included, and, 
as will be seen in the diagram and table, the increase for that year 
appears to be 77,000 instead of a normal increase of 10,000 or 20,000. 
The number of pupils in secondary studies now amounts to about 7 
persons in each 1,000 inhabitants, not counting the secondary pupils 
that are enrolled in elementary schools, which may amount to one-tenth 
of the entire number. It is important to observe that more than one- 
sixth of these students are preparing for college. One-half are study- 
ing Latin and one-twentieth are studying Greek.

a From 1871 to 1887 this Bureau did not ask principals of private high schools and academies to 
report the number of students pursuing each secondary study. Prior to 1890 the number of stu. dents reported by a large number of these private schools included the total number in attendance, the elementary pupils as well as the secondary students. For the past six years the two classes of students have been reported separately. Taking the reports from 1890 to 180) as a basis, the number of secondary students in private high schools from 1871 to 1889 has been carefully estimated for each year.

NORMAL SCHOOLS. XXXxI 
NORMAL SCHOOLS, 
   There was an increase of 3,862 in the number of students pursuing 
nornial or teachers’ training courses, as will be seen from an inspection 
of the tabular summaries in Chapter XX XVIII, the total number 
reported for the year ended June, 1896, being 84,400. The number of 
students in public normal schools was 40,421, an increase of 4,145 over 
the previous year; the number in private normal schools was 20,777, a 
decrease of 1,150, There were 7,026 normal students in universities and 
colleges, an increase of 624, The number of students pursuing teach- 
ers’ training courses in public high schools was 8,246, an increase of 
1,437; the number in private high schools and academies was 7,930, a 
decrease of 1,194. 
There was an increase in the attendance in public normal schools in 
each geographical division except the North Central, where there was 
a decrease of 43. The decrease in the number of students in private 
normal schools was in the North Atlantic and North Central divisions; 
in the other divisions the number was in excess of the attendance of 
the previous year. The increase in the number of normal students in 
universities and colleges was in the Northern and Western divisions; 
There wasa very small decrease in the Southern divisions. Theincrease 
in the number of students in teachers’ training courses in public high 
schools was in all the divisions except the North Atlantic, where there 
was a small decrease. The decrease in the private secondary schools 
was in all the divisions except the South Atlantic, where there was a 
smallincrease. It is gratifying to note the increased support extended 
to public normal schools by States, counties, and cities. The amount 
appropriated for the support of these institutions for the year ending 
June, 1896, was $2,187,875, an increase of $270,500 over the previous 
year. 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
Universities and colleges.—The total number of universities and col- 
leges for men and for both sexes (Chapter XX XIX) reporting during 
the year was 484, of which number 345 admit women to undergradu- 
ate courses of study. There are 188 institutions which have not as yet 
any endowment, 54 have endowment funds less than $25,000, and only 
4 institutions have endowments exceeding $5,000,000. In a large 
number of the institutions a comparatively small part of the work is 
collegiate. There are at present 278 institutions having less than 100 
students in undergraduate collegiate courses. The number of instruct- 
ors reported by the 484 institutions was 12,277, while the number of 
students of all classes, secondary and higher, was 159,372. Of the lat- 
ter number 47,014 were in preparatory departments, 68,629 in collegiate 
departments, 4,673 in graduate departments, and 25,438 in professional 
departments. The property reported was as follows: Volumes in libra- 
ries, 6,453,677; value of material equipment, $134,093,435; endowment

funds, $109,562,433. The benefactions for the year, so far as reported, 
amounted to $8,342,728, and the income, excluding benefactions, was 
$17,918,174. 
Colleges for women.—The 162 colleges for women had, in 1894-95, 2,552 
instructors and 24,663 students. The material equipment was valued 
at $15,568,508 and the endowment funds amounted to $5,308,558, The 
income was $3,456,983 and the benefactions received ee the year 
amounted to 8611, 245, 
Schools of technology—The number of schools of technology, exclud- 
ing technological departments of universities and colleges, was 48, 
having 1,118 instructors and 12,816 students. The. total value of all 
property was reported at $24,105,242, of which amount $10,384,293 
was reported as endowment funds. The income of these institutions 
was $3,526,018, of which amount $2,402,332 was appropriated by the 
General and State governments. The gifts and bequests received by 
the schools of technology amounted to but $96,133.

  ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL. XXXV 
Professional schools—There are 155 schools of medicine in the United. 
States, 144 of theology, 73 schools of law, 46 of dentistry, and 44 of 
pharmacy. The number of students in schools of theology shows but 
little variation from year to year, but in schools of law, dentistry, and 
medicine there is a rapid increase. 
Of the 144 schools of theology 57 are in the North Central Division, 
45 in the North Atlantic, 19 in the South Atlantic, 17 in the South Cen- 
tral, and 6 in the Western Division. 
Of the 155 medical schools, 116 are regular, 20 homeopathic, 8 eclec- 
tic, 2 physiomedical, and 9 graduate. The whole number of medical 
students of all classes was 24,437, and the number graduating was 
4,947, The number of law students was 9,780, dental 6,399, and phar- 
maceutical 3,873. 
ACCORDING TO THE EUROPEAN STANDARD. 
The question is often asked, How many students are there in higher 
education in the United States, measured by the European standard? 
It is well known that the gymnasium and realschule of Germany, the 
lycée and communal college of France, and the “public school” or 
college of England include in their course of study not only what is 
included in the curriculum of the secondary schools in the United 
States, but also some portion of the course in the colleges. 
I have caused a table to be prepared for the United States, showing 
the number of students in higher education on the European standard. 
For this purpose it was necessary to omit the freshman year, and in 
most cases even the sophomore year in colleges, and make a corre- 
sponding reduction in the professional schools. The result for the 
United States and each of its census divisions is given in the following 
tables: es

ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL. 
Chapter II presents a detailed account of the most important event 
in the recent history of education in England, namely, the attempt in 
the current year to secure the passage of a new education bill. The 
need of legislation in the interests both of elementary schools and of 
secondary education has long been recognized and was urged by the 
royal commission on elementary education of 1886 and the more recent 
commission on secondary education. The fact that the bill dealt with
-P-A-G-E-36
XXXVI REPORT OF. THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
both phases of the problem, and was the measure of a party the 
strongest in point of numbers that has controlled the Government in 
recent years, gives peculiar significance to its postponement. This 
occurred early in the committee stage, after the bill had passed its 
‘second reading by a majority of 267. 
Although the measure was the outcome of causes that had long been 
operating, it was precipitated by promises of further aid to parochial 
(voluntary) schools made during the campaign of 1895 by the leaders 
of the Conservative party. The necessity of increasing the efficiency 
of these schools that are educating more than one-half (56 per cent) of 
the children was unquestioned, and the Government was bound not 
less by considerations of the public welfare than by party demands to 
redeem the pledges that had been made. Unfortunately, as the sequel 
shows, the measure was weighted with proposals that seemed at least 
to favor sectarian ascendancy in the schools. It was further compli- 
cated by proposals as to local authorities, which, although they were 
on the lines of recent reforms in local government, seemed to threaten 
the independence of the boroughs. These two vulnerable features 
roused intense and determined opposition. 
The bill proposed to make every county and county borough a district 
of educational administration or altogether 126 new local authorities. 
It is interesting to note in this connection the immense increase in 
the urban population in recent years. In 1891 it comprised 71.7 per 
cent of the entire population, or an increase of 15.3 per cent in ten years 
as against an increase of 3.4 per cent for the total population. If only 
towns of 10,000 inhabitants are considered, the ratios of their popula- 
tion to the total are found to be 56.3 per cent in 1881 and 61.5 per cent 
in 1891. The balance of power, it will be seen, has gone over to the 
towns. 
A vigorous review of the bill is presented from an article by Sir 
- Lyulph Stanley, a leader of the progressive school party. 
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 
CURRENT STATISTICS.   Chapter III deals with the current statistics of education in Great 
Britain, and more particularly with those pertaining to England. The 
Government grant for elementary education amounted in 1895 to 
$31,324,170, which was 65 per cent of the entire expenditure. 
In day schools, board and voluntary, the average expenditure per 
scholar was $10; in board schools only, it rose to $12.50 per capita, of 
which the Government contributed 58 per cent and local taxes (rates) 
39 per cent. The voluntary day schools in which the per capita cost 
was $9.50 derived 50 per cent from the Government. 
In the debate on the education bill it was shown that the difference 
between the average expenditure in board and voluntary schools 
amounted to nearly $3 ($2.80) per capita of attendance, which was but
-P-A-G-E-37
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. XXXVII 
a trifle greater than the difference in the amounts paid for teaching in 
the two classes of school. 
This amount was $2.33 less per capita of attendance in voluntary 
than in board schools. In other words teachers in voluntary schools 
bore nearly the whole strain arising from the smaller income of voiun- 
tary schools, an injustice that would work disaster in the long run It 
was shown in the debate that while the Government was spending 
upon the army and navy at the rate of 30 shillings ($7.50) per capita 
‘of population, it was expending upon education only 7 shillings ($1.60) 
per capita. It was urged also that the expenditure per capita of pupils 
was less than in Scotland, Germany, France, Belgium, and Switzer- 
land, and that the rates of expenditure in the United States per capita 
(of pupils) were far in excess of those in England. 
The necessities of rural schools were particularly urged upon the 
House by Mr. Yoxall, who declared that the rural schools of England 
and Wales, taken as a whole, ‘were the worst supported, the worst 
staffed, and the worst managed of the public elementary schools in 
Europe.” 
The effects of the law providing for the remission of school fees are 
seen in the rapid increase in the number of free pupils, comprising 85 
per cent of the total in 1895, in the increase of school attendance, and 
particularly in the increased attendance of pupils over 10 years of age. 
Among additional statistics presented in Chapter IIT should be noted 
a table showing that the voluntary subscriptions to denominational 
schools have declined with the increase of Government liberality to the 
same, and a series of tables indicating the status of teachers with respect 
to qualification, position, and salaries. 
It is interesting to observe that in five years the average salary of 
head mistresses has increased by $25, as against an average increase 
of $15 for head masters. At the same time complaint is made that 
teachers are poorly paid, not adequately protected in their positions, 
and subject to unjust discrimination as compared with other public 
servants, from the lack of a general pension allowance. 
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 
Chapter IV, on Education in Central Europe, contains discussions of 
some of the peculiar features of the educational systems of Germany, 
Austria, and Switzerland. The first sets forth in the words of Coun- 
cilor Dr. Bertram, superintendent of public instruction in Berlin, 
the present status of industrial education in the capital of Germany, 
showing not only the various kinds of schools in existence for the ben- 
efit of trades and industries, but giving in detail their history and 
sources of support. The fact is revealed that the city of Berlin paid 
alone for trade schools and industrial evening and Sunday schools the 
large sum of $209,441 in the year 1894-95. These schools are all ele- 
mentary and secondary, for the royal polytechnic is not counted among 
those enumerated.
-P-A-G-E-38
    XXXVIIJ REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The compensation of elementary school teachers in Germany is dis- 
cussed in the same chapter with the view to finding the minimum 
averages in the various States of the Empire. The tables accompany- 
ing the article were first submitted to the German educational press by 
Professor Tews, of Berlin. They show that the teachers in Germany 
are paid less than in this country, but it must be remembered that 
they live rent free, or receive indemnity for rent. A similar minute 
statement regarding teachers’ salaries in Austria is presented in this 
volume. The following is the result of the inquiry for Austria: 48.8 
per cent of the men and 62.9 per cent of the women receive less than 
600 florins (or $300); 42.5 per cent of the men and 32.5 per cent of the 
women receive between 600 and 1,000 florins ($300 to $500), and 8.7 
per cent of the men and 4.5 per cent of the women receive more than 
1,000 florins (or $500). 
The work of reform schools in the Duchy of Baden is the subject of 
the next article. The imperial criminal code of 1876 decrees that no 
persons can be punished for crime before they are 12 years of age, but 
may be kept in custody for the purpose of reforming them according to 
the special Statelaw. Such children may be placed under reform train- 
ing, if both the criminal and orphan courts so decree. The special law 
in Baden (one of the 25 States of the Empire) fixes the maximum time 
limit at 16 years of age, and for certain specified cases even at 18 years. 
The Baden system of reform education recognizes two methods: De- 
praved and neglected children are taken from their homes and are 
either placed in other homes where they receive proper treatment and 
discipline, or they are sent to reform schools or reform farms. The 
account states the results of the two methods and other items of inter- 
est regarding sex, age, religion, cause of detention, and the per capita 
cost of maintaining reform schools. 
The statistics of higher education in the German-speaking part of 
Europe (Germany, Austria proper, and Switzerland), which are pre- 
sented in extensive tables, are complete, except in one point, i. e., the 
expenditure and income; this point can not be stated with accuracy, 
owing to the fact that the fees paid to private “docents” and extraor- 
dinary professors for lecture courses are not stated in official reports. 
A summary of the statistics of attendance is here given for 1894-95.

The following chapter (V) contains an account of music in the schools 
in Germany. It gives an historical review of that study and the pres- 
ent status of method. 
The Annual Report of 1894-95, vol. 1, pages 449-471, contained a 
symposium on.the question “Mental fatigue in school,” a subject inti- 
mately connected with child study. In this report (Chapter XXIII) 
the subject is continued in an article compiled from the statements of 
leading physiologists and psychologists of Germany, England, and 
America. 
A list of all the foreign universities, polytechnica, and higher agri- 
cultural, forestry, and mining schools has been compiled from the Jahr- 
puch of Prof. K. Trubner, of Strassburg (see Chapter XXXII). The 
institutions are arranged according to (1) date of founding, (2) number 
of students, (3) countries, and (4) alphabetically. 
PUBLIC, SOCIETY, AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES, 
In Chapter VIII is published the Bureaw’s quinquennial compilation 
of the statistics of public, society, and school libraries. The list 
embraces 4,026 libraries of 1,000 volumes and over, having in the 
agregate 33,051,872 volumes and 5,444,788 unbound pamphlets. The 
increase in number of libraries since 1891 has been only 523, but the 
increase in number of volumes was 7,074,229, or more than 27 per cent. 
For the year ending April 1, 1896, 2,851 libraries reported the addition 
of 1,591,861 volumes, and 2,233 of these libraries expended $1,574,410 
for new books during the year. The aggregate income of 2,437 libra-

ries reporting was $5,911,636; 600 libraries received $1,679,210 from 
direct taxation; 773 received $1,513,352 from State, county, or city 
appropriations; 594 derived $1,035,052 from endowment funds; 883 
received $386,441 from membership fees and dues; 303 collected $38,684 
from book rents ; 625 received $529,350 from donations, and 1,017 reported 
the receipt of $729,547 from sources not named. Only 605 libraries re- 
ported permanent endowments, which aggregate $17,570,673. The value 
of buildings owned by 567 libraries amounted to $33,291,259. In 1891 
the average number of people per library was 17,877, while in 1896 the 
number was 17,376; in 1891 the number of books per 100 of population 
was 41, while in 1896 the number was 47. The statistician has prepared 
a chart showing the relative number of volumes to each 100 of popula- 
tion by States. The chapter contains a separate list of the 627 libra- 
ries entirely free to the public having 3,000 volumes and over. These 627 
free libraries contain 9,062,363 volumes, and for the year ending April 
1, 1896, they had issued 27,015,234 volumes for home use. The statis- 
tician also collected statistics from 3,158 libraries having 300 volumes 
and over and less than 1,000 volumes. For want of space the list is 
not published, but the returns are summarized by States, showing 
that the 3,158 libraries contained 1,544,386 volumes. A comparison of 
the statistics of libraries reporting 300 volumes and over in 1875, 1885, 
and 1896 will indicate the growth of libraries in the past twenty years: 
= | Libraries | : Year. lreporting.| Volumes. 
  
  
  Library legislation.—The library, in many of the States, is already 
considered an essential part of the educational system. Public senti- 
ment, the forerunner of all real progress, seems to be making urgent 
demands for the library as a necessary adjunct to the public school. 
Cities and towns are agitating the question. The State legislatures, 
too, are yielding to public opinion and discussing the feasibility of 
appropriating money for the maintenance of public libraries. 
In recognition of this growing interest in the subject, a chapter has 
been prepared (Chapter IX) containing a compilation of the library 
laws of the several States and Territories. 
In Chapter X, Mons. E. Levasseur, a member of the Institute of France 
and a distinguished writer and statistician, has narrated the growth and 
expounded the doctrine of the education of the common people during 
the nineteenth century by the several States of Christendom. While 
not blind to the social unrest the education of the masses produces, he 
sees in the uncontrollable movement for their enlightenment the most 
distinguished claim that the present century will have upon the grati- 
tude of posterity.

  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. XLI 
FRANCE. 
The survey of public education in France (Chapter XI) emphasizes 
the effort made by the Republic to infuse into the centralized system 
the spirit of professional freedom. 
The most important departure that has been made from the policy that. 
prevailed under the Empire is the transformation of the State faculties 
into independent universities. This change, which was advocated in 
the earliest days of the Republic, and especially by Jules Ferry during 
his ministry (1879-1882), began to take practical shape in 1885. 
The successive measures tending to the desired result are noted. 
Finally (1890) a bill was introduced for organizing the faculties as 
universities. After varying fortunes the bill passed during the present 
year, although in a modified form. In fact it adds little more to the 
changes already effected than the title of minister. This, however, is 
not an empty name, for, as expressed by M. Rambaud, minister of 
public instruction, “The institution which is a university in all but the 
name, lacks legal existence in its true character.” 
The criticism, that the measure is opposed to the development of 
specialties, was met by the minister with particulars showing the 
impulse given to this very feature as the university idea has grown. 
This portion of the minister’s speech, which is cited in full (pp. 624-625), 
affords an interesting view of the efforts made by the faculties to bring 
their scientific instruction and researches into fruitful relation with 
local industries. <A similar tendency to specialization is noted in the 
faculty of letters, especially in the creation of chairs of local history 
and literature. 
There are indications that under the new order the financial resources: 
of the universities will be increased by private benefactions and by 
larger municipal subventions. - The need of improvement both in the 
amount and management of the finances is shown by the director of 
superior instruction, M. Liard, who draws very suggestive comparisons 
between the budgets of German and French universities (cited, pp. 
628-629). 
The question of the correlation of secondary and superior courses is 
agitated in France, but in a form quite different from that which it 
assumes in our own country. The typical secondary schools of France, 
the lycées, comprise a complete course of liberal education leading to 
the baccalaureate degree; the superior courses have been heretofore 
purely special in their nature. Even the faculties of letters and arts, 
at least outside of Paris, have been engaged almost exchusively in pre- 
paring intending professors for the licentiate or the examination for 
special positions (agrégation). The endeavor has been for some time 
to attract other classes of students to these faculties—to make them, 
in short, centers of general study and thus prolong the period of liberal 
culture. This it is difficult to do without radical changes in the lycée, 
ED 96. 11*  
-P-A-G-E-42
XLII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  the oldest and most tenacious feature of the French educational: sys- 
tem. At present, discussion centers in the baccalaureate. So long as 
this remains the goal of the lycée it is difficult to extend the course of 
liberal training over into the faculties. Hence the proposition to 
abandon the baccalaureate or to substitute a leaving examination at 
the end of the lycée as discussed in Chapter XI. 
The statistics of primary schools presented in the same chapter show 
a continuance of the decline in enrollment that has been noticed in pre- 
vious years. From 1891 to 1895 the decrease was three-tenths of 1 per 
cent. This condition excites some attention because (1) the ratio of 
decline is greater for boys than for girls, and (2) because it takes place 
only in public schools and secular private schools, chiefly in the former. 
The opinion is expressed by M. F. Buisson that some error lurks in the 
figures respecting the enrollment of boys which, it is believed, will be 
discovered by further investigation. 
It is interesting to note that of the teachers in public primary schools 
less than three-tenths of 1 per cent of the men and only 5 per cent of 
the women were without diplomas. 
The current obligatory expenditure for public primary schools in- 
creased by very nearly $3,000,000 from 1892 to 1894, reaching in the 
latter year $37,048,012, or $8.78 per capita of enrollment and 97 cents 
per capita of the population. If the State expenditure for primary nor- 
mal schools and the optional expenditure for primary schools borne by 
the communes be included, these per capita are raised to $10.24 and 
$1.13, respectively. The chapter contains a detailed statement of the 
requirements for admission to the French faculties (now universities), 
for which the.office is indebted to M. Paul Melon, of Paris, general sec- 
retary of the committee of patronage of foreign students. Following 
this is a statement as to the status of foreign students of medicine in 
France, prepared by Mr. Henry Vignaud, chargé d’affaires of the 
United States at Paris. 
Dr. Alcée Fortier, of Tulane University, Louisiana, has contributed 
an account of his personal observation of the annual competitive exer- 
cises of the lycée at the Sorbonne, and his subsequent visit to the lycée 
“Janson de Sailly,” which gives a very lively conception of the methods 
and policies of secondary education in France. 
Chapter XII deals with education in Mexico and Central America. 
A résumé of the history of education in Mexico is followed by an 
account of the educational convention of 1890 and of the work of the 
various institutions devoted to engineering and mining, medicine, agri- 
culture, commerce and industry, fine arts, military and normal schools. 
To this is appended an examination of the educational status of the 
various Central American States. 
Chapter XIII contains a report of the fifth International Prison 
Congress.

  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. XLII 
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 
One of the most valuable chapters in this report is Chapter XV, 
“Commercial education in Europe.” ‘To gather material for this 
report Professor James, its author, visited Europe, and on his return 
prepared this exceedingly valuable analysis of commercial education in 
Europe, particularly in Austria, France, and Germany. His object 
was not to present complete statistical tables as to number of schools, 
teachers, and students, but to give full information concerning a few 
typical institutions. The report places all the important information 
concerning these schools, including their curricula, into a form available 
for the use of teachers, principals, superintendents, and others who 
may contemplate the establishment of such schools in this country. 
Professor James advocates the commercial high school, which should 
run parallel with the present high school, and also the commercial school 
of higher grade, which should rank with the college or be organized in 
connection with existing colleges and universities. 
SCANDINAVIA. 
Chapter XX contains the latest educational information from Swe- 
den, whose school system has been treated in full in previous reports 
(Report 1888-89, pp. 196-221; 1891-92, pp. 423-449), as well as the first 
presentation of the conditions of edueation in Iceland, the governor- 
general, Magnus Stephensen, having courteously furnished interesting 
details. 
A movement to establish a university in Iceland is fostered by many 
learned men, natives of Iceland, who have received degrees from for- 
eign universities. At the close of the sessions of the Althing in 1893 
a committee of thirty members was formed to promote this object. 
While in Denmark women are excluded from taking part in the 
affairs of local government, in Iceland, its dependency, widows and 
spinsters are privileged to vote in all church and parish matters. 
In Sweden, as is the case in Norway and Denmark, church and state 
unite to educate the people; modern educational movements are dis- 
cussed by the leading men of the country; commissions have investi- 
gated the subject of the health and eyesight of school children, the 
results of such investigation being to lessen the overpressure in the 
matter of school studies. The ambulatory schools, moved from house to 
house in the district, are agencies of rural education. Schools for the 
training of both sexes together are gradually being introduced; the 
universities of the three countries admit women to full university privi- 
leges. Manual training, which had its birth in these northern countries, 
is taught more especially from the practical side. 
In Sweden the secondary schools do not form a continuation of the 
elementary grades, as in America, but reform movements are contem- 
plated which may do away with one or more of the lower classes of the 
secondary schools, thus making the elementary schools directly prepar- 
atory to the secondary.

XLIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE, 
Chapter XLII contains the statistics in detail of the 178 schools for 
the secondary and higher education of the colored race, These schools 
are distributed over 22 States, North Carolina having 27, Georgia 23, 
Tennessee 15, Virginia 13, South Carolina 12, Texas and Alabama 11 
each. For the year ending June, 1896, these 178 schools had 40,127 
students enrolled, an increase of 3,025 over the previous year. There 
had been an increase of 16 in the number of schools, most of these 
being public high schools. There were 25,092 pupils in the elementary 
grades, 13,563 students in the secondary grades, and 1,455 in the col- 
legiate departments. A prominent feature in nearly all these schools 
except the public high schools is industrial training, the number 
reported as receiving industrial training in some branch being 12,341. 
There were 4,672 colored students studying to become teachers. 
Chapter X XII comprises a study of superior and secondary education 
in the United States by Dr. Gabriel Compayré, rector of the University 
of Lyons, France. Dr, Compayré represented the ministry of publie 
instruction, France, at the Columbian Exposition (Chicago, 1893), and 
took a leading part in the educational congresses. The survey of our 
superior and secondary education is translated from the official reports 
of his mission presented to the minister. The study derives special 
interest from the fact that Dr. Compayré writes as an expert, making 
the French system his point of departure for the criticism and com- 
mendation of our own. Hence we have here an international study in 
which salient features of systems wrought out by two distinct peoples 
are brought into comparison. 
Chapter XXVIII deals with a subject indirectly yet particuiarly in- 
teresting to education. It contains an account of the Bertillon system 
of repressing crime by affording (it is claimed) an infallible means of 
identifying the habitual criminal, thus making operative the law which 
increases the punishment for a second offense. The merits of the Ber- 
tillon system have been proved by ten years of trial in France, and are 
attracting considerable attention elsewhere. In America it has many 
stanch and distinguished supporters. During the year 1896 New York 
adopted the system in its entirety, and a number of cities employ it. 
But its efficacy here is almost wholly dependent upon its universal 
adoption throughout the United States and Canada. 
In Chapter XX VII the reports made to this Bureau by the presidents 
of all the colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts are given. The 
chapter also contains a statement giving the money value of the-pro- 
ceeds of the 9,600,000 acres of land granted by the Federal act of 1862, 
of the organization of farmers’ institutes in the several States, and of 
the character of the new institution in Germany known as the Mechan- 
ical Engineering Experiment Institute. 
All of which is respectfully submitted.

The SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR. Commissioner.

  STATE COMMON-SCHOOL SYSTEMS. LXv 
Observations on Table 8.—The ‘‘ aggregate number of days’ schooling given” to all 
pupils (see column 6), which is the same thing as the aggregate number of days 
attended by all the pupils, has been computed for those States which do not make an 
explicit report of this item by multiplying the average daily attendance of pupils 
by the average length of school term in days. 
Conversely, the average length of school term (column 5) for the United States as a 
whole and for each of its geographical divisions has been obtained by dividing the 
aggregate number of days attended by the average daily attendance. 
By this method the school term of each State, in taking the average, is in fact given 
a weight proportioned to the school attendance of the State, as should be done under 
a correct interpretation of the expression, ‘‘ Average length of school term.” The 
result might more properly be called “Average length of attendance,” which is essen- 
tially what it is desired to know. 
A method which has been in use in some States for finding the average school term, 
of a county, for instance, is to weight the different school terms of the towns or dis- 
tricts the county is composed of by the number of schools in each. In other words, 
the total number of days (or months) all the schools of a county were kept is divided 
by the total number of schools to get the average time each one was kept. So, in 
finding the average term for the State, the school is taken as the unit instead of the 
pupil, the Bureau’s method. When the schools differ much in size (number of 
pupils), as they do in all mixed urban and rural systems, varying from some half a 
dozen to 500 or more pupils each, the average term obtained by this method varies 
considerably from that obtained by the foregoing. The long terms of the large city 
schools not being given their proper weight, the resulting average is too small. The 
same objection applies still more forcibly to weighting the school terms of the dif- 
ferent counties or towns by the number of school districts in each. 
Still another method is to add together the school terms of the different counties 
or towns and divide by the number of such counties or towns; i. e., the simple arith- 
metical mean is taken. An example of this occurs in the Indiana School Report of 
1894 (p. 572) in the return from Marion County, where it is stated that 14,193 pupils 
in Indianapolis attended 185 days, and 856 pupils in West Indianapolis attended 160 
days, while the average time the whole 15,049 pupils attended is computed at 172} 
: days, although nearly all (16 out of every 17) attended 185 days. This method, if it 
can be so called, gives altogether too short an average term, and nothing can be said 
in defense of it. It is as if, wishing to get the population per square mile of Minne- 
sota and Dakota combined, we said, Minnesota, 9.86; Dakota, 0.92; average num- 
ber of persons per square mile in the combined territory (0.92+9.86) —2—5.39, 
instead of dividing the total population of the two States by the combined area in 
square miles. 
The “aggregate number of days’ attendance” is a statistical item of the utmost 
simplicity and of great value, about the meaning of which there can be little or no 
difference of opinion. Every teacher’s register that records the number of pupils 
present each day in any school, as they all presumably do, contains the data for 
ascertaining it for that school for the school year by the simple process of addition 
or summing up.

LAWS RELATING TO CITY SCHOOL BOARDS. 
1. General Remarks.—The typical city system; Selection of members of school boards; 
Some notable systems; Control of revenues; The superintendent; Selection of teachers. 
2. Detailed descriptions of the school systems of New York City; Chicago, Ill.; Philadel- 
phia, Pa.; Brooklyn, N. Y.; St. Louis, Mo.; Boston, Mass.; Baltimore, Md.; San 
Francisco, Cal.; Cincinnati, Ohio; Cleveland, Ohio; Buffalo, N. Y.; New Orleans, 
La.; Pitisburg, Pa.; Washington, D. C.; Detroit, Mich.; Milwaukee, Wis.; Minne- 
apolis, Minn.; St. Paul, Minn.; Denver, Colo.; Indianapolis, Ind.; Charleston, 8. C.; 
Hartford, Conn.; Savannah; Ga. 
8. Tabular summary of school laws relating to the foregoing cities. 
If it were required to describe the typical organization of an Ameri- 
ean city school system, the following might be given: A board of edu- 
cation is created by law whose members are elected by the people, serve 
without pay, and have full legal power to establish, maintain, and con- 
trol free public schools for all children of school age in the limits of the 
city. 
Each year they make estimates in detail of the amounts of money 
required for the schools during the next coming year, which estimates 
ave submitted to the city council. That body appropriates money 
for those purposes named in the estimates which they think neces- 
sary and proper in view of all other needs of the city’s government, 
and of the expected revenue from the taxes which they consider it 
expedient to levy. The money once appropriated is controlled by the 
board of education who buy sites, build and repair schoolhouses, pur- 
chase supplies, hire and pay the necessary officers and teachers. 
They make regulations for the management of the system and employ 
as their principal executive officers a secretary and a superintendent, 
the former to look after the details of their business affairs and the 
latter to have especial care of all matters relating to instruction. The 
superintendent is presumably an experienced educator, well versed in 
all that pertains to school management, and a thorough student of

4 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
pedagogy on its philosophical side; he is selected, moreover, with 
reference to his administrative ability. The course of study is largely 
» the handiwork of the superintendent and embodies his ideas. 
The teachers are appointed by a committee of the board, acting with 
the superintendent. New teachers must be graduates of the city nor- 
mal school or of an institution of equal or higher grade. If the latter, 
they must pass an examination before the committee. 
The schools themselves are, (1) elementary, with a course of study 
covering eight years; (2) high, with a four-year course, and (3) a nor- 
mal school with a year of professional study for intending teachers, A 
child is supposed to begin the course at six years of age and to com- 
plete it at eighteen, but in practice the average is about a year greater 
than this. z 
Evening schools are maintained during the winter months, and there 
may be kindergartens and a separate manual-training high school, but 
these, though growing in popular favor, are not yet sufficiently numer- 
ous to have a place in the type system. 
It may be that the system described has not a single example in the 
United States which combines all the details mentioned exactly as 
they are set forth. The number of possible variations are as great as 
the combinations on the chess board, and in regard to every feature 
there are instances of radical divergence from the type described; but 
in a general way it may be taken as representative of the systems of 
the majority of American cities. 
  MEMBERS OF SCHOOL BOARDS. 
In regard to the number of members of the board there is not nor can 
there be any uniform rule. It is sometimes held that there should be 
some relation between the size of the city and size of the board, but 
whether this is necessary depends wholly on the extent to which execu- 
tive powers are confided to paid subordinates, who are supposed to be 
trained experts in their particular lines. The New York board con- 
trols the schools of over a million and a half of people, yet it numbers 
only 21 members, while Pittsburg, with a population of about a quarter 
of a million, has 37 members in a central board and 222 in local boards. 
There are 7 members of the Minneapolis board, while Hartford, with 
only a third as many inhabitants, has 39 school visitors and committee- 
men. Such contrasts are numerous. 
The methods of selecting the members of the governing boards are 
exceedingly varied. 
Ward politics is a matter constantly before the mind of school law- 
makers, and any amount of inventive genius has been exercised to 
devise a way of choosing school boards that would make it impossible 
for the ward boss to interfere. Incompetent principals and teachers 
chosen to “encourage” political henchmen; contracts corruptly given 
to fatten the treasuries of partisan organizations; assessments of
-P-A-G-E-81
  LAWS RELATING TO CITY SCHOOL BOARDS. a 
teachers for campaign funds; unseemly intrigues, strifes, and bicker- 
ing within the schools themselves by adherents of different parties; the 
son of some local heeler allowed to be habitually unruly, to the detri- 
ment of general school discipline, because the teacher fears for his 
position if he attempts to assert his authority—all these evils and more 
are feared by those who have seen the results when local politics has 
had undue influence. 
Where there is a school board clothed with due authority, whose 
members are not influenced by political considerations, these things can 
not be. Hence the solicitation for a board “above politics.” 
The first boards were chosen at popular elections and the members 
were ward representatives. This has not always worked well. The 
local feeling in members has sometimes prevented them from appreci- 
ating any interests other than those of their own districts; local poli- 
ticians of small caliber have crept in from out-of-the-way wards, and. 
have made things very unpleasant in various ways. To avoid these 
things, in many cities the board is élected from the city at large and 
not as representatives of any particular locality. In other places the 
mayor of the city appoints the board, often with the advice and con- 
sent of the council. But, alas for human devices, instances have often 
occurred in which both these methods of election have proved to be as 
objectionable as ward elections, for there are big politicians as well 
as little politicians, and the big ones are no more disinterested than 
the little ones; the city machine may dictate the board members at 
large just as the ward machine may elect the board members from the 
wards. And mayors are not always above appointing their personal 
and political friends, even if they are not the most desirable men for 
the places; so these plans also have been discarded in some places, 
as in Philadelphia, where the board is appointed by the judges of the 
superior court, and in New Orleans, where they are in part appointed 
by the governor of the State and in part elected by the city council. 
All of these schemes come from efforts to take the schools ‘ out of 
politics.” But after all there is but one way to do that, and that way 
is by the creation of a general sentiment demanding clean and honest 
administration of the schools, without regard for any consideration save 
their best good. With such a sentiment the worst law, apparently, 
may be satisfactory; without it the best law may fail. Examples to 
prove this are not hard to find. The law that relates to Savannah, 
Ga., would probably be the very last to be copied by a modern city 
school lawmaker. There we have a unique instance of a board thatis 
a self-perpetuating close corporation, handling public funds, holding 
public property in their own corporate name, and managing public 
schools. This would be considered nowadays a very dangerous power 
to put in the hands of what is practically a private corporation; but 
the Savannah board was established in 1866, and during the entire 
thirty years that have passed no change has been made in the law
-P-A-G-E-82
6 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
governing them save to extend the field of their operations. The mem- 
bers have usually been professional and business men, and have always: 
been of high standing in the community. The list has embraced Jews, 
Protestants, Catholics, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, but 
it appears that no action of the board has ever been tainted with a rea- 
sonable suspicion of improper motives. 
Washington, D. C., is often described as the best governed city in the 
United States, yet there is probably no place on the face of the earth 
where men are governed by written laws in which the laws themselves 
are in a more chaotic condition than in the District of Columbia, The 
laws that regulate the school trustees are past finding out, as the por- 
tion of this chapter which relates to the details of the Washington 
system shows. Nevortheless the schools are harmoniously and success- 
fully conducted, and deservedly stand high among the systems of the 
country. Incidentally I might mention that the force of an adverse 
public sentiment has been sufficient to utterly overthrow two entirely 
different systems of government in the District within the last thirty 
years. 
On the other hand, another city might be mentioned in which a half 
dozen reasonably good laws have been in force in the last thirty years 
and not one of them has succeeded in giving the city a system free 
from the evil eye of the politician. But until recently evidences of any 
general interest in the management of the schools were hard to find. 
A gentleman prominent during the last year or two in the agitation for 
school reform, according to his own account, had practiced law in the. 
same city for twenty-six years before he had ever been conscious of see- 
ing a public school building. His explanation of the unsatisfactory 
condition of the schools was that the indifference which he himself had 
felt was general among a very large proportion of the best class of citi- 
zens. If good citizens turn the administration of the laws over to 
schemers and self-seekers, how can even the best of statutes accomplish 
good results? 
But while it is true that the publie opinion behind a law is the prin- 
cipal factor in the success of its operation, the importance can not be 
overestimated of so constructing the statutes as to provide for those 
times which may come to any city when the public shall become less 
watchful through long security, or when the chosen officers shall be 
beguiled by influences not of the best. 
  SOME NOTABLE SYSTEMS, 
In some cities that relic of rural school organization, the local trustee 
system, is still retained. In Hartford, Conn., the organization is noth- 
ing more nor less than that of every country township in the State, 
and a very complicated organization itis. The ward trustees are even 
more powerful in some respects in Pittsburg, Pa., than in Hartford, for 
there they may levy taxes for the purposes which they control, while
-P-A-G-E-83
  LAWS RELATING TO CITY SCHOOL BOARDS. 7 
in Hartford the district taxes are laid in district meetings. The cen- 
tral board in Pittsburg have more complete control over the high school 
than do the school visitors of Hartford, but on the other hand the super- 
intendent is appointed by the school visitors of the latter city, while all 
the trustees vote for the corresponding officer in the former. Phila- 
delphia also retains its ward trustees, though their powers are some- 
what less extensive than in Pittsburg. 
In all three of these cities the central authorities examine and license 
teachers, while the local boards select and appoint them. 
It has been only within the last few months that the local trustees 
were overthrown in New York City, and this year is the first in their 
history in which all the common schools have been controlled by a 
single board. 
There are comparatively few plans of organization now in operation 
which are not the products of evolution, but in a few notable instances 
schemes have been brought into being and enaeted into law which had 
little or no local precedent on which to build. The most conspicuous of 
these in late years has been the so-called “federal system” of Cleveland, 
Ohio. The provision of a legislative body without executive functions, 
and of a single executive officer who is directly and solely responsible to 
the people for the administration of the schools, are novelties in Ameri- 
ean city school organization, and up to this time the example of Cleye- 
land remains unique. The plan has met with considerable favor. It 
received the indorsement of the subcommittee of five of the National 
Educational Association’s famous committee of fifteen, and will undoubt- 
edly influence school legislation in the future. Unquestionably as long 
as the director is a paragon and his principal appointee, the super- 
intendent, is above criticism, such a system as this will be conspicu- 
ously successful, But time, and time alone, will show the results of 
one-man power in school management during revulsions of popular 
favor causing sudden radical changes, or relaxations of public wateh- 
fulness resulting in the election of men of doubtful fitness. These 
things sometimes occur and such possibilities must always be taken 
into consideration. 
School district No. 1, Arapahoe County, Colo., which embraces the 
greater part of Denver, is another Minerva among school organiza- 
tions, and its system has been widely copied, especially in the West, 
with modifications to suit loeal conditions. The school board is supreme 
in school matters and owns no allegiance to any other local authority. 
There are but six members, and two are elected each year for three years 
at a special election. In the twenty years that the system has been in 
operation it has been unusually successful. The policies of the board 
have been subjected to no sudden deleterious changes, and the progress 
of the schools have been uniform and consistent. But as Cleveland 
has had only one director under its present system, so this district of 
Denver has had but one superintendent, and that a strong man who
-P-A-G-E-84

exercises great influence in shaping the course of the schools’ affairs. 
In neither case, therefore, can the excellence of the schools be neces- 
sarily ascribed to the system as such. To say that it was the system 
of organization that made it possible for these good men to retain their 
positions so long, and that therefore the system itself is responsible for 
the good schools, would be erroneous. Other superintendents now in 
office have held on for just as many years or more under systems that 
are conceded to be bad. 
The present laws that relate to the school committee of Boston con- 
tain nothing especially remarkable, but their history is full of things 
which it would be well to avoid. The primary schools were managed 
prior to 1855 by a committee which had grown from 36 to 190 members. 
They filled their own vacancies and were generally a law unto them- 
selves. At the same time there was a general school committee of 24 
members, 2 elected by the people of each of the twelve wards, and when 
the primary school committee was abolished the general committee was 
increased to 72, or 6 members from each ward. With the annexation 
of more territory to the city the school committee grew to 116 members. 
It was so unwieldy as to interfere with the proper prosecution of busi- 
ness, and in 1875 the number was cut down to 24, elected from the city 
at large. They had formerly no authority to determine the location or 
character of the schoolhouses, that power being exercised by the city 
council until 1875. Then the school committee were given a voice in 
the matter, but the division of authority was equally unsatisfactory in 
practice, and in 1889 the entire control of the erection of buildings was 
turned over to the school committee, though the money must first be 
appropriated by the council. 
The mayor is ex officio a member of the board of education in some 
places, as in Atlanta, Ga., and in others he is ex officio its president. 
The latter was formerly the case in Washingtonand in Boston. A rather 
unusual provision is made in a few cities, of which Rochester, N. Y., 
and Detroit, Mich., are examples, by which the approval of the mayor 
is necessary to acts of the board of education. In cases of this kind the 
board may generally override the mayor’s veto by a two-thirds vote. 
In one city in the United States there is a school system in which 
there is no school board, namely, Buffalo, N. Y. All school legislation 
there is done in the city council, and the city superintendent, an officer 
elected by the people, is the head of the city department of education. 
Though there is no exact parallel to the Buffalo plan of organization, 
there are other cities in which the school board is the creature of the 
city council and is so subordinate as to have no authority whatever 
save that which the council choose to delegate. Precisely this is the 
case in Atlanta, Ga. The mayor and council have legal authority to 
maintain a system of public schools and to “provid, for appropriate 
agencies to regulate, improvise, and carry on said system of schools 
and render the same efficient.” All the rest is in their discretion, To 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  LAWS RELATING TO CITY SCHOOL BOARDS. 9 
their credit be it said, however, the mayor and council haye provided 
a board of education with very full powers, practically the only power 
retained being the appropriation of money. It is a matter of pride to 
the city that the board of education has always been composed of men 
of high character, that they have the hearty support of the rest of the 
city government, and that they are permitted to perform their duties 
without vexatious interference. 
Substantially the same power over the schools is given to the coun- 
cil of Baltimore, Md., though the city school board is provided for by 
State law. The board of St. Paul, Minn., has been since 1891 consti- 
tuted somewhat similarly, though their functions are more minutely 
specified by law. The St. Paul board have full power to appoint teach- 
ers and to divide between them the money appropriated for salaries, but 
in Baltimore nearly every act of the board may apparently be reviewed, 
altered, or annulled by the council. 
The contrast between the Minneapolis and the St. Paul boards is 
striking. Though the two cities are practically one, on one side of the 
river that divides them the board has very large powers, even to the 
right to levy its own taxes, while on the other side the board is not 
even a corporation, and can not hold property. : 
CONTROL OF REVENUES. 
The best criterion of the power of a school board is the degree of 
their independence in money matters. If they must prepare detailed 
estimates that may be refused as a whole or in any item by some other 
body, their functions are so restricted as to be almost entirely minis. 
terial, They can notintroduce any novelty or provide for any extension 
without the concurrence of the authority which holds the purse strings. 
This is usually the state of affairs, and as tending to conservatism and 
economy it has its advantages when a board develops an inclination to 
foster expensive fads. But that can seldom be charged; it more often 
happens that the board is deprived of funds urgently required to pro- 
vide for the actual needs of the children in the way of buildings and 
teachers. 
The powers of the Western cities in this respect are usually much 
more extensive than those of the East. St. Louis, Denver, and Minne- 
apolis are types of cities whose school boards enjoy the right to levy 
whatever tax they require without submitting their estimates to any 
other body. The maximum that may be levied is, however, always 
limited by State law. 
In Milwaukee, Wis., a variation is introduced by which the school 
board determines the amount of the levy unless the city council decide 
otherwise by a two-thirds vote. In Detroit all money asked by the 
board for current expenses must be granted if it does not exceed a cer- 
tain fixed sum per pupil, but if that is not sufficient the council decides 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
whether the desired funds shall be appropriated. Estimates for build- 
ings and sites must run the gauntlet of both the council and the city 
board of estimates. 
  THE SUPERINTENDENT. 
The selection of the city superintendent is another point upon which 
there are interesting differences of practice. He is usually elected by 
the school board, but in San Francisco, Buffalo, and some other cities 
he is a city officer and is elected at a popular election. A man must be 
a good politician as well asa good educator to succeed in obtaining 
office under these conditions, and the field of choice is necessarily nar- 
rowed to men well known and popular in the city. Such a thing as 
securing as superintendent a man who had made his reputation in 
another city would be out of the question. Philadelphia secured both 
Mae Alister and Brooks from other places; Cleveland, Ohio, brought 
Draper from New York and Jones from Indianapolis, and so many 
others of the most successful superintendents have found their widest 
fields in places far distant from the scene of the beginning of their 
eareers; but this style of selection is not for San Francisco or Buffalo. 
Nevertheless the list of superintendents of those cities embraces several 
names prominent in educational circles. 
In some of the New Jersey cities the same plan of the popular elec- 
tion of superintendents prevails, and the result has been in many cases 
the choice of men without even the pretense of an expert knowledge of 
school matters. The law undoubtedly contemplated that the superin- 
tendent elected should perform the usual duties of the office, but this 
has not proved advisable in some instances. In one city the board of 
education has appointed a supervising principal, who is to all intents 
and purposes the superintendent in the ordinary sense of the term, 
while the superintendent, officially so called and elected as such by the 
people, is but little more than the treasurer and maker of reports. 
The most powerful city superintendent in the country, so far as the 
Jaw can make him so, is Mr. L. H. Jones, of Cleveland, Ohio. With 
absolute control over all that relates to instruction, he has the full 
power of examination, appointment, and removal of teachers. He him- 
self is the appointee of one man, the school director, though he must be 
confirmed by the school council. It remains to be seen whether time 
will prove this plan to be wise. It may or may not lead to more fre- 
quent and sweeping, and therefore harmful, changes in policies and 
personnel than does the usual practice of making the superintendent 
amenable to the government of a continuous board. The same man has 
been director since the beginning of the present system four years ago, 
and both the superintendents whom he has appointed have been not 
only men of marked ability, faithfulness, and probity, but have been 
believers in the same general educational policies; so that “the Cleye- 
land plan” has not yet been put to any real test.
-P-A-G-E-87
  LAWS RELATING TO CITY SCHOOL BOARDS. TE 
In Washington, D. ©., the same authority which appoints the mem- 
bers of the school board also appoints the superintendent, and the latter 
does not depend for his official pesition upon the former. The relations 
between the board and the superintendent have been in the main cor- 
dial and harmonious, but at one time a bitter controversy arose between 
the first superintendent and the board, which was very demoralizing to 
the schools.i The board earnestly sought to change the method of 
choosing the superintendent, urging that if he were their own appointee 
such disputes would be impossible. They failed in this, but secured 
the removal of their antagenist. 
SELECTION OF TEACHERS. 
Next to the actual instruction of pupils, the selection of teachers is 
the most important duty connected with the schools. <A certificate of 
fitness of some description is always required before appointment, and 
that certificate is, or should be, good evidence that the holder will 
perform reasonably satisfactory service. Selection from certificate 
holders would therefore seem to be attended with but little risk. But 
the examination for the certificate is at best only a partial test,-and 
many pass it who could searcely be rated as mediocre teachers, and 
occasionally some may fail who are capable of doing good work in the 
schoolroom. The examination is a help in the work of selection, but 
no more. It narrows the field, but does not designate the individual. 
Commonly the examination and choice of teachers are given to the 
school boards, and the details are matters of local regulation. No 
matter what the rules might be, the judgment of the superintendent is, 
under normal conditions, treated with a deference that practically 
amounts to putting the choice in his hands. It has been said of one 
superintendent that he has planned every schoolhouse built and has 
selected every teacher appointed in his city for the last twenty years. 
And nominally his duties include neither. This, if literally true, is 
exceptional, but it is natural and proper that the man who directs the 
work of the teachers and is to a great extent responsible for its char- 
acter should have a voice in their selection. In many cases the choice 
rests wholly with the superintendent. The absolute control exercised 
over examination and appointment by the superintendent at Cleveland 
has already been mentioned. The same power as to appointment rests 
with the superintendent at Buffalo, but there is an examining board 
appointed by the mayor, whose tests candidates must meet before they 
aro eligible for appointment. In some places, as in New York and Cin- 
cinnati, the superintendents nominate the teachers and boards make 
the appointments. The superintendent is nearly always one of the 
examining board or committee. ! 
If the reports of the central beards of the cities concerned be true, 
and there is no reason to think they are not, the appointments made

by local trustees in cities in which there are such officers are not always 
of the best. District committees at Hartford have often employed 
persons as teachers and then sent them to the school visitors to be 
examined; and one case is mentioned in a recent report of a person 
who was found teaching in the schools without a license, and was 
directed by the visitors to present herself for examination. It was 
only after repeated attempts and by the exercise of great leniency 
because of a desire for harmony that she was able to pass at all. 
This merely illustrates the difficulties that are liable to arise when 
separate boards have concurrent jurisdiction over the same subject. 
CONCERNING THE DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS. 
In the following pages I have presented the details of the systems 
of 23 cities so far as they are set forth in the school laws. I have shown 
the historical development of the systems of New York and Wash- 
ington, in the first case because of the interest which has been aroused 
by the recent reorganization of the schools, and in the second because 
that was the only way in which a just comprehension of the system 
could be obtained. 
The arrangement of the cities is in order of their size. All those 
having over 200,000 inhabitants are included, and some smaller cities 
are given because of especial features in each case that make them 
interesting specimens of school organization. 
The epitome in tabular form at the end of the chapter will be con- 
venient for comparison. 
New Yor«k City. 
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT, 
The constant tendency of legislation relating to the control of the 
schools of New York City has been in the direction of centralization of 
authority. 
In the infancy of the system, fifty years or more ago, each ward or 
district was practically supreme in the administration of its own 
schools. The local trustees selected their own teachers, subject to the 
approval of the inspectors, who were also ward officers, chose their own 
course of study, and decided upon the methods of school organization.! 
They purchased their own supplies and sent the bills to the board of 
education, who exercised no control over their expenditures, but simply 
divided the school moneys between the several wards in proportion to 
the number of children in school. 
At this period, that is, under the law of 1844, which was the first 
under which the system was effectively organized, each ward elected 
at a special election two commissioners, two inspectors, and five trus- 
tees. One commissioner and one inspector were elected each year to 
serve two years, and one trustee was elected each year to serve five

-P-A-G-E-89
  LAWS RELATING TO CITY SCHOOL BOARDS. rs 
years. All the commissioners in the city composed the board of educa- 
tion, but the inspectors and the trustees were purely local officers, the 
latter having practically all the power in relation to the management 
of the schools, and the former auditing the bills and performing certain 
visitorial functions.!_ The commissioners were ex officio members of the 
boards of trustees of their respective wards, and largely controlled the 
expenditure of the money allotted by the board of education to the 
ward schools. In feeling and in practice they, too, were more local than 
general officers, so that there was nobody who made it his especial busi- 
ness to look after the school system of the city as a whole.?, There was 
a “county superintendent,” it is true, who was appointed by the county 
board of supervisors and who was amenable to the rules and regula- 
tions of the State superintendent. But his powers and duties were not 
such as to give him any authority over the schools,’ and his influence in 
unifying the schools was not appreciable, even if any attempt was made 
to accomplish such a result. 
The special election feature failed to be successful in practice. The 
interest of the people could not be sufliciently aroused to “ bring out 
the vote,” and in 1851 special elections were discontinued, and since 
that time all popular voting for school officers has been done at general 
city elections. 
A city superintendent was provided for by the same law, to be 
appointed by the board of education, to whom the power was given to 
fix and pay his salary. Among his duties were the licensing of teach- 
ers in conjunction with the inspectors, and for cause he had the power 
to annul licenses. But this was of little account, for there was nothing 
to prevent the trustees from employing a teacher without a license, if 
they chose, until the board of education in 1854 passed a regulation 
preventing such employment. 
Serious defects in time became apparent in the system. The shifting 
of population produced great inequalities in the population of the sev- 
eral wards and gave the more southerly wards undue predominance in 
the board. Great differences became manifest in the efficiency of the 
schools of the various wards. Some trustees were negligent and others 
were even unduly ambitious in advanciug the interests under their 
charge. Irregularities of various kinds were brought to the surface,” 
and, since the laws did not clearly define the functions of the several 
classes of officers, conflicts of authority inevitably followed. 
The revision of 1864.—There could be but one outcome to-such an 
unsatisfactory state of affairs, and in 1864 a law was passed greatly 
strengthening the board of education and enlarging the powers of the 
inspectors. 
The division of the city into wards, then 22, was still recognized in   
1 Act of May 7, 1844, in Manual of the Board of Education of 1850.

the new law in the election of trustees, five of whom were to be elected 
for and by each ward, one each year, for a term of five years. 
But for commissioners and inspectors the city was divided into seven 
school districts, in each of which one commissioner was elected every 
year for a three-year term. The number of members of the board of 
education was, therefore, fixed at 21 instead of 44,as before. The elec- 
tion of inspectors by the people was discontinued, and they were to be 
appointed by the mayor with the confirmation of the board of educa- 
tion. There were three for each district, and their term of service was 
fixed at three years, one being appointed each year. The commis- 
sioners were no longer to be ex officio members of the board of trustees, 
the expectation being that if they were separated from the administra- 
tion of local affairs they would better realize their duties to the whole 
city. : 
The appointment of principals and vice-principals was made subject 
to the confirmation of the board of education, but the appointment of 
other teachers and of janitors remained in the control of the trustees 
as fully as before. Power was given to the board of education to 
remoye any school officer for immoral or disgraceful conduct in any 
manner connected with his official duties, and this power was utilized 
on several occasions. 
The source of support of the schools remained as before, namely, taxes 
laid by the county board of supervisors at the demand of the board, 
within specified limits. Nor was there any change in the method of the 
distribution of money between the wards on the basis of the number of 
pupils in school, though the limits of age were extended. 
Aitacks on the board.—Great hopes were entertained of the effects of 
the new scheme of organization, but dissatisfaction soon appeared, 
and a vigorous attempt was made in 1867 to procure the passage of a 
law entirely changing the management of the schools. A Dill was 
introduced in the legislature which contemplated the abolishment 
of the board of education, the inspectors, and the trustees in toto, and 
the substitution in their stead of a commission of seven persons to 
be appointed by the governor with the confirmation of the senate, to be 
called the metropolitan board of instruction. This board was to exer- 
cise the powers of all the school officers whom it was expected that it 
would supplant, and its members were to hold office for eight years and 
receive salaries of $5,000 each per annum. 
In support of this bill it was charged that the existing system had 
failed to accomplish the objects for which it was established; that the 
teachers appointed by the trustees were incompetent and inefficient; 
that the rules and regulations of the existing board had failed to secure 
proper discipline and an economical and judicious expenditure of the 
public money; and that the entire administration of the systems impera- 
tively demanded a change in the officers and agents to whom it was 
confided.
-P-A-G-E-91
  LAWS RELATING TO CITY SCHOOL BOARDS. aS 
The charges were denied, and were disproved to the satisfaction of 
he legislative committee in charge of the matter, and the bill failed.t 
he taking away of all semblance to local control was the strongest 
bjection to the proposed scheme and should of itself have been suffi- 
ient to defeat it. 
But charges against the board continued to be frequently reiterated. 
t was said that the board did not practice due economy; that they 
eglected to provide means for primary education while spending large 
ums upon a course of instruction carried. far beyond what was neces- 
ary or proper in a common school; that they fostered a system of 
ramming, and that they neglected or excluded the poor; that they did 
ot pay sufficient attention to the sanitary surroundings of the pupils. 
he board met all these charges with elaborate statistics and argu- 
ents, justifying their expenditures and explainmg their official 
ctions.? 
District representation abolished.—The opponents of the existing sys- 
em prevailed, however, and on April 30, 1869, an act passed the legis- 
ature which effected a complete revolution in the constitution of the 
oard. The principle of district representation was renounced, and the 
ayor was directed to appoint 12 commissioners of common schools to 
orm a board of education with all the powers and duties of the former 
oard. The principle of minority representation was to be observed in 
aking these appointments. 
These commissioners were to hold office until December 31, 1871, 
and after that time the 12 commissioners were to be elected by the 
people. No voter was to have the privilege of voting for more than 
7 commissioners, and the 12 who received the highest number of votes 
nvere to be declared elected. The term of office specified was three 
years.’ 
A city department of education.—But before the time set for holding 
the election thus provided for, the law was repealed by the act of April 
18, 1871, which established an additional department of the city, called 
the department of public instruction. To this department were trans- 
ferred all the powers and duties of the board of education, and at. its 
head was a board of 12 commissioners appointed by the mayor, who 
was directed to recognize the principle of minority representation in 
his appointments. Their term of office was five years. 
All laws providing for the election of local trustees were repealed by 
the same act and they were to be appointed by the mayor. The pro- 
vision requiring confirmation of inspectors by the school commissioners 
was also repealed. An equally important change was in reference to 
finances, for the power of the board of education to fix the amount of

  school tax to be levied by the county board of supervisors was taken 
away and the newly created department was prohibited from incurring 
any expense unless an appropriation therefor had previously been made 
by the city council. The duty of making the estimates of sums neces- 
sary for conducting the several boards and departments of the city was 
given to the mayor, the comptroller, the commissioner of public works, 
and the president of the department of public parks. The aggregate 
amount fixed by these officers was required to be levied and collected 
~ asa tax by the county board of supervisors. 
As will be seen, the whole administration of the law was practically 
put in the hands of one man—the mayor of the city—for the appoint- 
ment of all school officers was put into his hands. The effect of this 
was to make the school system a part and parcel of local politics, and 
the schools were in danger of becoming ‘‘an instrument of partisan 
aggrandizement and power.”! 
The board of education revived.—This was plainly seen by the legis- 
lature, and the act of 1871 was repealed within two years of its passage. 
The department of publicinstruction was abolished by the act of March 
30, 1873, and the board of education was again brought into being. 
The number of school commissioners was once more fixed at 21, but 
there was no requirement this time for district representation. They 
were to be appointed by the mayor for three-year terms, one-third of 
the number being appointed annually. 
The inspectors then in were all legislated out of office, and the mayor 
was required to appoint 3 for each school district, their terms of 
office to be so arranged by lot that one-third should expire each year. 
Appointments after the first year were to be made for three years. 
The appointment of the ward trustees was taken from the mayor and 
for the first time given to the board of education. ‘Their power in rela- 
tion to teachers received an important restriction, for the appointment 
of principals and vice-principals was given practically without reserve 
to the board of education. The right to make a nomination, indeed, 
still rested with the trustees, but if the board did not appoint the per- 
son so nominated within twenty days, the sole power of appointment 
lay with the board. 
The board of estimate and apportionment was also created in 1873, 
and the present method of determining the amount of money to he 
allotted to the several city boards was then inaugurated. 
The duties and relations of the several classes of school officers as 
then constituted were thus summarized by the president of the board, 
Mr. William Wood, in the report of the board for 1878: 
The immediate supervision of the schools in the respective wards is given to the 
trustees, who appoint teachers, nominate principals to the board of education for 
approval, and, subject to general rules prescribed by that board, provide books, fuel, 
and all other supplies, select and recommend school sites, and, under the authority

of the central board, secure proposals, award contracts, and audit and certify bills 
for the payment of the cost of repairs, etc., as provided hy law. Their power of 
expenditure of money, although limited, gives them a fund for the incidental expenses 
of the wards, beyond which an appeal to the board almost invariably insures an 
appropriation for every reasonable demand. Cases of embarrassment have some- 
times arisen where trustees have exceeded their proper limits, but they have been 
infrequent. 
The inspectors have the general oversight of the schools in their districts. They 
must approve the removal of teachers before the same can take effect, and counter- 
sign all bills and pay rolls. They serve as an advisory branch of the local boards. 
The board of education is the legislative body which regulates and supervises the 
whole. 
The “ revolution” of 1896.—This remained the system of organization 
for twenty-three years, for after 1873 no important change was made 
until 1896, when another “ revolution” took place. 
For years there had been a growing conviction that the ward trustee 
system was not compatible with the best interests of the schools. The 
difficulty of securing for so many offices men with sufficient knowledge 
of the proper conditions of school work who would be uninfluenced by 
the clamors of local politics was held to be insurmountable under the 
conditions that prevailed in New York City. 
In 1893 a commission was appointed by the mayor, with legislative 
sanction, to draft a scheme of reorganization. After an exhaustive 
investigation, the commission proposed a plan by which the inspectors 
were to be abolished, the trustees deprived of all but visitorial fune- 
tions, and the board of education clothed with enlarged powers. The 
board was to be composed of 2L members appointed by the mayor as 
before, but their duties were to be performed very largely through a 
board of 20 division superintendents acting under a city superintendent 
who was to have full control of the educational administration of the 
schools. 
In the meantime the “reform movement” directed against the entire 
municipal régime then in power arose, flourished, and succeeded in 
obtaining possession of the city government. Reform in the schools 
was one of the planks in its platform, and after consideration of the bill 
prepared by the commission it was adopted and introduced in the leg- 
islature by Mr. Pavey, whence it became known as the “ Pavey bill.” 
Its passage was never accomplished, the strenuous opposition of the 
teachers of New York City having much to do with its defeat, which 
occurred in the spring of 1895, 
The board of education then took their turn at bill making, and a 
measure bearing the prestige of their approval was introduced at the 
legislative session of 1896. It was known as the “Straus bill,” from 
the name of him whose ideas entered most largely into its composition. 
In it the local trustees still shone resplendently, and their numbers 
were even increased, though in some respects the bill was admitted by 
all to be an improvement over the old system. 
But against the trustees war to the knife had been declared in other 
ED 96——13 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
18 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
quarters, and in February, 1896, a “citizens’ committee of one hun- 
dred” was organized, with an imposing hst of prominent names, to fight 
the Straus bill and to secure, if possible, the passage of one along the 
lines of the defeated Pavey bill. 
Senator Pavey about the same time introduced a new bill, which in 
brief terms abolished the local trustees and transferred their duties to 
the board of education, without changing the composition of the board 
in any way. 
The entire matter was finally referred to a small subcommittee of 
the senate, whose investigations and deliberations resulted in the bill 
which finally passed. Its provisions are sketched in the succeeding 
paragraphs. 
The old board of education remains unchanged and they have re- 
elected the superintendent, Mr. John Jasper, who has held the office 
for seventeen years. The district inspectors and the ward trustees as 
formerly constituted have been abolished entirely, and the administra- 
tion of the schools has been given wholly to the board of education 
and the superintendents appointed by them. The inspectors provided 
for are without real authority and possess functions that are visitorial 
and, to use the word in a new sense, reportorial only. 
The pendulum has swung from complete decentralization in 1846 to 
complete centralization in 1896. 
LAWS NOW IN FORCE.! 
The board of education consists of 21 commissioners of common 
schools, appointed by the mayor of the city. Their term of office is 
three years, and one-third the number are appointed annually. Vacan- 
cies are filled by the mayor by appointment for the unexpired term. 
The commissioners may hold no office of emolument under the city, 
county, State, or National Government, except the offices of notary 
public, commissioner of deeds, or in the National Guard. 
Organization.—The board must organize annually by the election of 
one of its members as president, to hold the office for one year. 
They may appoint a city superintendent of schools and a superin- 
tendent of school buildings, each to hold office for six years; as many 
assistant superintendents of schools as they may deem necessary, for 
terms of six years each, one-sixth, as nearly as may be, to be elected 
each year; and a clerk of the board of education, a deputy clerk, a 
deputy superintendent of buildings, such supervisors of special branches 
and as many assistant clerks and other officers as may be necessary, all 
of whom serve during the pleasure of the board and perform such duties 
as the board might specify. The compensation of all these officers is 
determined by the board. The superintendent of schools and assistant 
superintendents may be removed for cause by a vote of two-thirds of 
all the members of the board.

Revenues.—The amount of tax levied and the sum appropriated to 
the use of the schools, as well as to the other departments of the city 
government, are determined by the city board of estimate and appor- 
tionment, consisting of the mayor, comptroller, president of the board 
of aldermen, and the president of the department of taxes. Each of 
the several city boards, including the board of education, send annually 
to the board of estimate and apportionment a detailed estimate in 
writing of the amount of expenditure required in their respective 
departments, Duplicates of these departmental estimates are also sub- 
mitted to the board of aldermen. The board of estimate and appor- 
tionment prepare in detail such a provisional estimate as they deem 
advisable as to the aggregate amount to be allowed to each department, 
and this provisional estimate is submitted to the board of aldermen, 
who make such objections or rectifications as they see fit. The board 
of estimate and apportionment then consider the suggestions of the 
board of aldermen and after such consideration prepare the final esti- 
mates. Time is given to allow the taxpayers of the city to be heard, 
and then the final estimate is duly signed and the amounts therein are 
thereby appropriated to the several purposes named therein.!

ing, the property is sold by the proper municipal authorities and the 
proceeds are at once appropriated to the board of education for the 
purpose of purchasing other property or erecting other buildings.

third being elected each year. The thirteenth member is the member 
of the board of education representing that ward, who is ex officio a 
member of the sectional board and is entitled to all the privileges of 
such membership. School directors must reside in the ward for which

The board of education must make returns annually to the common 
council of its receipts and expenditures, specifying those on account of 
the general and special funds, respectively, with such other details as the

same manner and at the same time as the taxes for other city purposes.

All free white persons residing in the limits of the city of St. Louis 
are constituted a body politic and corporate, under the name of “The 
Board of President and Directors of the St, Louis Public Schools,” and 
by that name may sue and be sued; purchase, receive, and hold prop- 
erty, real and personal; may sell or lease the same, and may have a 
common seal. 
The powers of the corporation are vested in a president and direc- 
tors, who must be free white males, at least 21 years of age, and resi- 
dents and taxpayers in the city for the two years preceding their 
election. No person holding any other position under the city of St. 
Louis, elective or appointive, and no person interested in any lease 
from the board, may be a member of the beard of school directors. 
The number of members of the board of directors is 21, 7 of whom 
are elected on general ticket at large by the qualified voters of the 
city, and 14 are elected by districts by the qualified voters of those 
districts, and must be residents of the districts which they severally 
represent. 
The 14 districts are defined by the city circuit court, and must be 
composed of contiguous wards and of as nearly equal population as 
practicable. 
The term of office is four years, and the election biennial. Four of 
the members at large are elected at one election and three at the next, 
and seven of the district representatives on the board are elected at 
each biennial election. 
If a vacaney occurs among the district representatives by reason of 
death, resignation, expulsion, or removal from the city, the vacancy is 
filled for the unexpired term by an election by the voters of that dis- 
trict, to be held in such manner as may be provided by the board; but

if the vacancy is among the members at large, it is filled by an election 
held by the school board itself till the next general school election, 
when the remainder of the unexpired term, if there be any, is filled 
by election in the city at large. Whenever any election for school 
directors has failed to be held by reason of the neglect of the board of 
directors, the circuit court must, upon petition of five citizens, order 
the said election, appoint judges of election, and issue certificates of 
election to the persons elected. 
The board of directors must elect one of their number to be presi- 
dent, and must appoint a secretary, a treasurer, and such other officers 
as they deem necessary, and prescribe their duties and compensation. 
No director may receive any compensation for his services. 
There must be four stated meetings of the board every year, the 
times and places to be prescribed by the board, and the president or 
any three members may call special meetings. A majority of all the 
members elected constitute a quorum. Members of the board, the 
secretary, and the treasurer must, before entering upon the discharge 
of their duties, take an oath to well and faithfully perform the same. 
There must be levied and collected annually on all taxable real and 
personal property of the city a tax of not more than one-half of 1 per 
cent, which tax must be paid to the corporation and used and applied 
by the corporation to the purposes of its creation. 
The officers of the city of St. Louis charged with duties in connection 
with the assessment and collection of taxes perform the same duties in 
regard to taxes levied by the board of president and directors of St. 
Louis public schools. The collector of the city must collect all taxes 
levied by the board, must give bond to them for the faithful perform- 
ance of said duty, and must account for and pay over to the board all 
school taxes collected by him. His compensation for his duties in this 
connection is at the same rate as for similar service in behalf of the 
general city taxes. If he fail to make the bond required the board 
must proceed to elect his successor in the same manner as if he had 
resigned. The board determines the rate of taxation for each year by 
resolution, a copy of which, duly certified, is delivered to the collector 
and to the register of the city on or before August 1 each year. 
The title to all school lands and public school property in the city is 
vested in the board of president and directors. It is their duty to con- 
trol and manage all lands granted by the Congress of the United States 
to the inhabitants of St. Louis for school purposes, or the funds arising 
from the same. They may lend money arising from the sale or lease of 
such lands upon good security, either real or personal, until it becomes 
proper, in their opinion, to invest such money otherwise for the purpose 
of education. No director may borrow money or purchase or lease land 
from the board. 
The board of president and directors have power to judge of the 
qualifications and elections of members; to prescribe the time, place,

The school committee is composed of 24 members, 8 of whom are 
elected each year by the qualified voters of the city to serve three years. 
It is the duty of the clerks of the several wards to make returns to 
the city clerk of the votes cast for members of the school committee, 
and after the entry by the city clerk of said returns in an official book 
kept for the purpose it is the duty of the board of aldermen to examine 
and compare them and to cause certificates of election to be issued to 
such members of the school committee as appear to have been chosen; 
but the school committee is the final judge of the qualifications and 
elections of its own members. 
The school committee must meet and organize on the second Monday 
in January in each year. A majority of all the members chosen consti- 
tute a quorum. They must choose a secretary, not of their number, an 
auditing clerk, and such other subordinate officers as may be expedient, 
define their duties, fix their compensation, and may remove them at 
pleasure. Vacancies in the school committee caused by refusal of a 
member elect to accept, by resignation, change of residence, or other- 
wise, are filled by the board of aldermen and the remaining members 
of the school committee in convention assembled. A majority of the 
ballots of persons entitled to vote are necessary to election. The term 
of office of a member so elected is only for the remainder of the munici- 
pal year, and the remainder of the unexpired term, if such there be, is 
then filled by election of the people.

grant certificates of graduation from the Baltimore City College and 
from the high schools. 
The school commissioners must organize and maintain separate

beshown by examination to posses the necessary moral and intellectual 
qualifications. But in no case may white teachers be employed in the 
same school with colored teachers.

their own number. 
The superintendent, who is elected by the people, is ex officio a mem- 
ber of the board, but may not vote.

The board of education annually reports to the city and county board 
of supervisors an estimate of the amount of money required for all pur- 
poses in the conduct of the schools during the coming year; but the 
ageregate amount must not exceed $35 per pupil in average daily 
attendance. The board of supervisors are authorized and empowered 
to levy and collect the amount of the tax determined by the board of 
education. But the whole amount of tax that may be levied for all 
municipal purposes is limited to $2.35 on each $100 of assessed valua- 
tion, and the estimate of the board of education therefore appears to 
be subject to reduction by the supervisors. 
If the money received and collected in any year be insufficient for the 
necessary current expenditures of the schools, the board of education 
must certify the fact of such deficiency to the board of supervisors of 
the city and county, and the latter must supply the necessary funds, 
being authorized to raise the money by loan or otherwise in anticipa- 
tion of the annual tax. Money for building or repairing schoolhouses 
may not beso raised except in case of fire or other unforeseen calamity. 
All moneys received or collected on account of public education in 
the city and county of San Francisco are deposited in the city treasury, 
and payments are made upon drafts signed by the president of the 
board of education and the superintendent, and countersigned by the 
auditor of the city and county.

former being a member of the council and the latter not a member. 
Legislation is by resolution, each resolution being submitted to the 
school director. His signature to the resolution, or his failure to return 
it to the council with his objections at their next meeting, makes it 
operative. But if he return it to the council at their next meeting with 
objections, the resolution fails, unless it is approved by two-thirds of 
all the members of the council, in which case it takes effect without the 
signature of the director. The approval of the director may be with-

There is no board of education in Buffalo, but the department of 
public instruction is one of the ten city departments, and the city super- 
intendent is its head. 
The city has legal power to establish, maintain, and regulate public 
schools. 
The city is from time to time divided by ordinance into school dis- 
tricts, in each of which there must be maintained one or more primary 
or grammar schools. Such schools are open and free to all persons 
between 5 and 20 years of age residing in their respective districts. 
The city may also maintain and regulate one or more high schools and 
schools for manual and technical training. 
The schools share in the apportionment of the school moneys of the 
State, and the amounts which fall to the share of Buffalo are paid to 
the proper city officers. All expenses of the school department are 
included in and paid out of the general fund. 
The city comptroller is authorized to embrace in his estimates a sum 
not exceeding $150,000 annually to be used solely for the purchase of 
school lots and the erection, enlargement, repair, and furnishing of 
school buildings. An additional amount not exceeding $300,000 may be

must hire all teachers for the period of time and at the compensation 
and upon the conditions provided by ordinance. He must see that the 
courses of study and systems of education established by ordinance are 
observed. If none be so established he must direct the courses of study 
and systems of education to be pursued. The teachers are subject to 
his orders and direction. He may suspend, and for cause and after a 
hearing, with the concurrence of the mayor, dismiss any teacher. He 
must annually make a comprehensive report to the common council of 
the condition of the schools. He must appoint a citizen well versed in 
the German as well as the English language to superintend the teaching 
of the German language in the schools, and who must also act, when 
not otherwise employed, as secretary to the superintendent. 
The board of examiners consists of five citizens of Buffalo appointed 
by the mayor for five years each, their terms of office being so arranged 
that one is appointed each year. The mayor may at any time suspend 
any member, and for cause and after a hearing may remove him. Vacan- 
cies are filled for the unexpired term by the mayor. The examiners 
must meet monthly, and their officers are a chairman and a secretary. 
It is their duty to visit and inspect all the schools at least once in each 
term. 
The teachers are divided into three: grades, namely, high-school, 
grammar-school, and primary-school grades. The superintendent must 
designate the subjects and the scope of the examination for teachers in 
each grade, and the examinations are conducted by the board of exam- 
iners. Those applicants who pass the examination are certified to the 
superintendent as eligible for appointment, and from that list the super- 
intendent selects new teachers. The board of examiners must make 
annual report to the common council in regard to the condition. of the 
schools as ascertained by their inspection, the operation of the system 
of examinations, and any suggestions they deem proper for the more 
efficient accomplishment of the purposes of their appointment,

ex officio members of the board, and are entitled to participate in its 
deliberations, but may not vote. No school director may receive com- 
pensation for his services as director. 
The board must organize within ten days after its appointment, with 
the election of a president and a vice-president, chosen from its mem- 
bers, and a secretary, who may not be a member. The treasurer of the ° 
city is ex officio treasurer of the board, and the city attorney acts as its 
attorney. The board of directors is a body corporate, with power to 
sue and be sued. Eleven members constitute a quorum. 
The secretary may receive a salary to be fixed by the board. Inaddi- 
tion to the duties of his office which the board may prescribe, he must 
make quarterly reports to the State superintendent, keep the accounts 
of the board, and report to the board at each monthly meeting the cur- 
rent expenses for that month. 
The treasurer of the board holds office for four years, or during his 
term as city treasurer. He may be removed after due trial before the 
board for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, and in case of removal 
by the board they must elect a treasurer, who may not be a member of 
the board. 
All public schools of the city, and the property and appurtenances 
thereof, are under the direction and control of the board of directors. 
They fix the salaries of the teachers, porters, and porteresses, of the 
secretary and employees, and of such assistant superintendents as they 
may deem necessary. 
They must limit their annual expenses to their annualrevenue. They 
must prescribe rules for the examination of candidates for teacherships, 
and no teacher may be employed who has not a certificate of qualification; 
must elect teachers in order of their merit as shown by examination; 
hold regular monthly meetings; declare vacant the seat of any member 
guilty of neglect or of conduct unbecoming a member, and must report 
each vacancy to the authority by which the expelled member was 
appointed. 
They may establish normal and evening schools. They may appoint 
a competent and experienced educator as superintendent, at a salary of * 
$2,500 a year, and for a term of four years, unless removed for cause 
after an impartial hearing. 
It is the duty of the superintendent to aid the directors in organiz- 
ing the schools and improving the methods of instruction therein, in 
examining candidates for teacherships, in conducting periodical exami- 
nations of pupils for promotion, and in maintaining general uniformity 
and discipline in the management of all the schools. He must make 
reports to the board of directors and to the State board of education, 
and whenever notified to be present he must attend the meetings of the 
State board of education. 
The board of directors must present to the common council of the 
city each year a full report of the condition and operations of the schools

and a detailed exhibit of their receipts and expenditures, and their 
report must be accompanied by a certified statement of the average 
daily attendance of pupils during the year, and of the average expense 
per capita of their instruction. It is the duty of the common council 
in making up the budget of their annual expenses to include therein 
the amount necessary to meet the expenses of the schools, as shown by 
the statement of the board of actual attendance and cost of instruction, 
with such additional allowance for probable increased attendance and 
contingent expenses as may seem just and reasonable to the city coun- 
cil, and a sum sufficient to keep in repair all schoolhouses and school 
grounds belonging to the city. But the aggregate amount appropriated 
must not exceed the estimate of the board of directors, nor may the 
amount appropriated by the city be less than $250,000 per annum. 
A tax of 1 per cent has been imposed by State authority on all tax- 
able property in the city for the purpose of liquidating the debt of the 
city. By an act passed in 1894 the board of liquidation, in charge of 
this matter, were directed to pay to the board of school directors from 
this tax each year such a sum as will, with the amounts appropriated 
by the city council, reach a total of $337,500. 
PITTSBURG, PA.! 
CENTRAL BOARD OF EDUCATION. 
The city of Pittsburg constitutes an independent school district. 
‘Whenever it becomes necessary under the law, each of the school 
boards of the respective subdistricts” of the city elect one person to 
servo as a member of the central board of education of the city, which 
person so elected must be at the time of his election a citizen of the 
subdistrict for which he is chosen, but he is not disqualified by reason 
of membership in the local board. 
Annually, within twenty days of February 1, the members of the cen- 
tral board meet and organize by choosing a president, a secretary, and a 
treasurer. The first named must be of their own number, but the other 
two officers may or may not be, at the discretion of the members thereof. 
Members of the central board hold their offices for the term of three 
years, and the terms are so arranged that one-third expire annually, 
Vacancies caused by death, resignation, removal from the subdistrict, 
or otherwise are filled for the unexpired term by election by the proper 
local board of directors. Seats of members who neglect or refuse to 
perform their duties may be declared vacant by the board. 
The president presides at the meetings of the board, authorizes the 
secretary to call special meetings whenever he deems them necessary,

  issues the duplicates and warrants for the collection of school taxes, 
takes the bond of the treasurer, signs all warrants on the treasurer, as 
well as the reports of the State superintendent, and does all other acts 
lawfully pertaining to his office. 
The secretary keeps minutes of the meetings of the board, prepares 
duplicates of school taxes, keeps account of all abatements and exon- 
erations, prepares reports, prepares and attests all warrants on the 
treasurer, and performs all other duties pertaining to the office. He 
receives a salary fixed by the board. 
The treasurer gives bond for the faithful performance of his duties, 
receives all State appropriations, district taxes, and other school funds 
of the district, and pays therefrom all warrants drawn on him by the 
board, signed by the president and attested by the secretary. Heis 
allowed to retain for his services a sum not over 1 per cent on the 
money received and paid out by him. 
In the absence or refusal to serve of the president or secretary, the 
board may appoint a president or secretary pro tempore. The board 
must hold at least one stated meeting per month, and a majority of the 
members elected constitute a quorum. 
The central board of education must ascertain the amount necessary 
for conducting the schools and certify the same to the councils on or 
before the second Monday in January in each year, and the councils 
must add the amount so certified to the aggregate of taxes required for 
the city, and they must appropriate the same for the schools. 
All warrants drawn upon the city treasurer upon such appropriation 
must be signed by the president and the secretary of the central board 
of education, and must be submitted to the city comptroller, whose only 
duty in connection therewith is to countersign the warrant and to enter 
it in the proper account. 
The central board are entitled to reseive that part of the State com- 
mon-school fund which is annually apportioned to the city of Pittsburg. 
They may borrow money, not to exceed $50,000, to erect schoolhouses 
or purchase sites, and may borrow an additional $50,000 and issue bonds 
for the same. 
If the central board neglect or refuse to levy the proper taxes or fail 
to perform their legal duties, the court of quarter sessions of the county, 
upon complaint of six taxable citizens and upon due proof, may declare 
vacant the seats of the delinquent members or member, and may appoint 
others in their stead to serve till the next annual election of the cen- 
tral board of education. 
The board as a body corporate have power to sue and be sued; to pur- 
chase and hold such real and personal property as may be necessary for 
the establishment and support of the mechanical art schools, high 
school, and schools for colored pupils, and may sell and dispose of the 
same when no longer necessary; to have a common seal; to make by- 
laws, rules, and regulations.
-P-A-G-E-119
  LAWS RELATING TO CITY SCHOOL BOARDS. 43 
The central board have power to purchase ground, erect or repair 
buildings, to purchase furniture, apparatus, books, and other personal 
property for the high school and schools for colored pupils; to deter- 
mine the number of teachers in all schools, and to fix and pay their 
salaries; to determine the books used, and the course of study pursued 
in all schools. Text-books may not be changed oftener than once in six 
years. Physiology and hygiene, with special reference to the effects of 
stimulants and narcotics, must be taught. 
The central board must purchase text-books and loan the same free 
to all pupils. They must continue and maintain one high school for 
pupils of both sexes, and one or more separate schools for colored pu- 
pils; no distinction may be made on account of the race or color of any 
pupil. They may maintain a normal department in connection with 
the high school, and may establish and maintain one or more schools 
for instruction in mechanic arts and kindred subjects, and instruction 
may be given in the evening as well as in the day. — 
The central board must exercise a general supervision over the high 
school, the mechanical art schools, and the schools for colored pupils, 
and must, by one or more of the members, visit said schools at least 
once a week. They may at any time examine, or cause to be examined, 
any or all of the teachers in the high school and the schools for colered 
pupils, and may issue certificates setting forth the branches which said. 
teachers are qualified to teach. They have the appointment of all 
teachers in the high school and schools for colored pupils and of teach- . 
ers of all special branches in the ward schools, and may dismiss them 
for cause at any time. 
The central board must make an annual report through the city 
superintendent to the State superintendent. 
BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF SUBDISTRICTS. 
Each of the wards of the city constitutes a subschool district, but a 
subdistrict may be subdivided, or two of them may be consolidated by 
the central board of education, upon the petition of the proper boards 
of directors, provided the city councils by an ordinance declare the 
subdistrict so made to be a separate election district. 
In each subdistrict there is a board of directors of six members, 
elected by the people of the several subdistricts. ‘The term of office is 
three years, and two directors are elected each year. 
The several subdistrict boards have power to fill any vacancy caused 
in their number by removal, death, resignation, or otherwise until the 
next organization of the board. ‘They may declare vacant the seat of 
any member who neglects or refuses to attend to his duties as member. 
Tf all or a majority of the membersof any board of directors refuse 
or neglect to perform their lawful duties, the county court of quarter 
sessions, upon complaint of six taxpayers, and upon due proof, may 
declare their seats vacant and appoint others in their stead, to serve 
until the next annual organization of the board.
-P-A-G-E-120
  44 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Each board of directors must organize annually by the election of a 
president and a secretary, who must be members of the board, and a 
treasurer, who may or may not bea member. The duties of these offi- 
cers are those usually performed by such officers. The treasurer must 
give sufficient bond, and is allowed to retain for his services a sum not 
over 2 per cent of all money received and paid out by him. 
Each board of subdistrict directors must hold at least one stated 
meeting a month; a majority of the members constitute a quorum. 
The several boards of the subdistricts may levy annually a special 
tax upon the assessed property of their respective wards not exceeding 
the amount of the regular annual school tax for the year, to be applied to 
the purchase of ground, the erection or repair of buildings, furniture, 
apparatus, books, stationery, fuel, and janitors. The central board of 
education must be notified of the amount of tax so levied, and the said 
amount is levied and collected in the same manner as the regular school 
tax. i 
Any one of the subdistrict boards may borrow money to the amount 
of $50,000. 
The several boards of directors of subdistricts have the power to 
purchase ground, to erect, enlarge, and repair school buildings, to pur- 
chase furniture, apparatus, books, stationery, and fuel, to pay janitors 
in their respective districts, to borrow money and to provide for the 
payment thereof with its interest, and to levy taxes for such purposes. 
The title of all real and personal property of the subdistrict schools 
is vested in the several boards of directors, and they may sell or dis- 
pose of the same whenever they deem advisable. 
_ The boards of directors may obtain by condemnation land required 
for school purposes when the same can not be secured by agreement 
with the owners. They appoint the teachers and exercise a general 
supervision over the schools of their respective subdistricts, and must 
by one or more of their members visit each of said schools at least once 
a month. 
In order to enable the central board of education to make the required 
reports to the State superintendent, the subdistrict boards of directors 
must make annual reports to the central board. 
Free evening schools must be maintained by the subdistrict boards 
for not less than four months a year when requested to do so by 20 or 
more pupils. 
No member of any school board may hold any office of emolument 
under said board.? 
The city superintendent is elected for a term of three years by a con- 
vention of all the school directors in the city, called for the purpose by 
the president of the board of education. 
The president and the secretary certify to the State superintendent 
the name and address of the person elected city superintendent,

together with the amount of compensation fixed upon. If no valid 
objection is received by the State superintendent within thirty days, he 
commissions the superintendent for the term for which he was elected. 
The salary of the superintendent is paid by the central board of 
education in the same manner as the salaries of teachers are paid. 
The superintendent must either by himself or by such person or per- 
sons as he may appoint examine all persons who may apply for appoint- 
ment as teachers, and must give to each one found qualified a proper 
certificate. No teacher may be employed without such certificate. 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. (WASHINGTON CITY.) 
The organization of the District of Columbia is unique, and the 
school system presents so many peculiarities that its features can not 
be satisfactorily shown without a brief statement of the circumstances 
that led up to the present conditions. 
Prior to 1871 the District was composed of three distinct corporations, 
indegendent of each other but all amenable to the control of the Con- 
gress of the United States. These corporations were the city of Wash- 
ington, the city of Georgetown, and the levy court, which governed the 
county, or that part of the District which lay outside the limits of the 
two cities. The city of Washington was the most populous and most 
important of the three corporations, 
SCHOOLS IN THE CITY OF WASHINGTON. 
  The first act of the city of Washington relative to schools was passed 
in 1804 by the city council, and established “a permanent institution 
‘for the education of the youth of the city of Washington.” Superin- 
tendence of the schools was placed under the direction of 13 trustees, 
7 of whom were elected annually by the councils and 6 were chosen by 
those who contributed $10 for the promotion of schools, each contrib- 
utor having as many votes as he had contributed sums of $10, 
In 1816 the city was divided into two districts with separate boards 
of trustees, who were elected in part by the city councils and in part 
by contributors as before. 
The first real attempt to inaugurate a public-school system in the 
modern sense was that of 1844, the schools having been previously in 
the nature of charity schools. The schools were then put in charge of 
a board of trustees of 12 members elected by the city councils, 3 from 
each of the 4 school districts, the members from each district consti- 
tuting a subboard for that district. The method of appointing the 
trustees was changed in 1858, the mayor receiving authority to appoint 
with the advice and consent of the board of aldermen. By the same 
act of the city council the mayor was made ex officio president of the 
board of trustees, and the appointment of the secretary and the treasurer 
of the board was also given to him. 
In all this time the real control of the schools was in the hands of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
46 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
  city government, to whom Congress had given power ‘“‘to provide for 
the superintendence of the public schools and to endow and collect 
taxes for the same.” 
The trustees of the schools received limited powers from the city 
councils, but the latter reserved the right to suspend or revoke any of 
those powers and to exercise supervision over all the acts of the board, 
even to the minutie of school discipline. The power of making all 
appropriations, of electing the officers of the board and of altering its 
organization, of determining the grade and number of schools, and of 
fixing the salaries of the teachers was retained by the city councils.! 
The superintendent.—Provision for a superintendent of public schools 
was made in 1869, and his salary was fixed at $2,500 a year. He was 
appointed by the mayor, with the advice and consent of the board 
of aldermen, was directed to preside at the meetings of the board in 
the absence of the mayor, and was entitled to vote on all questions 
before the board. Later in the same year the power and importance 
of the office were curtailed, and the superintendent was made practi- 
cally the executive officer of the board. It was then made his duty to 
carry into execution the rules and regulations of the board of trus- 
tees; to visit tle schools, that he might obtain, as far as practicable, 
a personal knowledge of the condition of all the schools and be able to 
suggest improvements and remedy defects; to pay particular atten- 
tion to the classification of pupils, and assist the board of trustees in 
establishing a uniform system of instruction; to advise teachers as to 
the best method of instruction and discipline, and to carefully observe 
the manner in which they conducted their schools. Whenever he found 
any teacher incompetent, he was required to report the same to the 
subboard of that district. To him was given, under rules established 
by the trustees, the general superintendence of all the schools of the 
corporation. He was required to devote his whole time to the duties 
of his office and keep himself acquainted with the progress of the 
public-school system in other places, that he might be able to suggest 
appropriate means for the advancement of the public schools of the 
city. He might attend any of the meetings of the board and speak on 
all questions. 
No enumeration of the duties of the superintendent has since been 
made, and presumably these requirements are still in force. 
The relations between the first superintendent appointed and the 
board were neither amicable nor harmonious, and the board in 1870 
requested the council to change the method of appointing the super- 
intendent by giving that duty to the board. The request was not 
granted in the terms in which it was preferred, but a change was soon 
afterwards made in the office of superintendent. The new appointee 
was acceptable to the board and the question of a change in the man- 
ner of appointment was not agitated further.

_ Colored schools.—In 1862 the colored schools of Washington and 
Georgetown were organized by act of Congress under a separate board 
of trustees of three members, one appointed each year for three years 
by the Secretary of the Interior. These trustees were to receive a 
share of all moneys appropriated for schools in proportion to the num- 
ber of colored children to the whole number of children. 
The number of trustees was increased from three to nine in 1873 and 
_ their appointment was given to the governor of the District. 
The superintendeney of colored schools was established in 1887, 
TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT. 
The three distinct corporations, namely, the city of Washington, the 
city of Georgetown, and the levy court for the county of Washington, 
were abolished in 1871, and in their stead was substituted a single Ter- 
titorial government, having a governor and a legislative assembly. 
Congress made it the duty of that assembly to maintain a system of 
free schools in the District, but provided that all the acts of the old 
corporations should remain in force till repealed. 
In August, 1871, the legislative assembly enacted that there should 
be three boards of school trustees in the District, one for Washington, 
one for Georgetown, and one for the county. 
The board of trustees for the city of Washington was to be composed 
of 20 members, 5 from each of the 4 school districts of the city. That 
of Georgetown was to have “2 members from each of the council 
districts of the city” [it had 5 members in 1873], and the board of 
the county was to have 7 members.’ These were all to be appointed 
by the governor for a term of two years each. 
This act, with another act passed two days later, provided for as pee 
intendent of schools, a secretary and treasurer for each of the three 
school organizations, who were also to be appointed by the governor. 
All these trustees and officers were directed to perform the duties of 
their respective offices, and all laws and ordinances of the three old 
corporations were declared to be in force in the respective localities 
except so far as they might have been affected by the acts of the legis- 
lative assembly. 
The act of Congress of 1862 establishing a board of trustees for col- 
ored schools of course remained in force, so that there were still four 
school boards in existence, each independent of the others, 
The Territorial government was fruitful in schemes for the physical 
improvement of the city. The board of public works dominated all 
the other branches of the government, and their vigorous measures 
and unusual expenditures necessitated heavy taxation and produced 
wide-spread dissatisfaction. Congress was forced to apply a heroie 
remedy, and once more made a radical change in the for of govern- 
ment.!

SCHOOLS UNDER THE COMMISSIONERS. 
  The Territorial government was abolished in 1874 and in its stead 
there was inaugurated a government by a commission of three persons, 
appointed by the President, in whom all the powers and duties of the 
former governor were vested. Since that time all legislation for the 
District of Columbia has been done in the Congress of the United 
States, the executive power being given to the three Commissioners of 
the District. This arrangement was only provisional at first, but in 1878 
apermanent government was established along the main lines of the 
act of 1874. ; 
In the original act of 1874 establishing the commission they were 
authorized to abolish any office, to consolidate two or more offices, 
reduce the number of employees, remove from office, and make appoint- 
ments to any office authorized by law. 
Under the authority thus given the Commissioners abolished the 
offices of secretary and treasurer of all the four school boards in the 
District, transferring all their duties, so far as they related to the dis- 
bursement of money to the comptroller of the District. They also 
ordered that the purchase of supplies be made by the comptroller and 
auditor of the District, subject to the approval of the Commissioners. 
On August 8, 1874, the same authority consolidated the four school 
boards into one board of 15 members, 9 of whom were to be residents 
of Washington, 3 of Georgetown, and 3 of the county. A month later 
the number was increased to 19, 2 additional members being appointed 
from Washington and 2 more from the county. 
the laws defining the powers and duties of the four former boards 
continued to apply to the new board in the performance of their func- 
tions for the four classes of schools. More specific reference to the dif- 
ferences in these will be mentioned in subsequent paragraphs. 
The new board made no radical changes in the school affairs. The 
same person had already been made superintendent of the white schools 
of Washington, of Georgetown, and of the county; there was another 
superintendent for the colored schools of Washington and Georgetown, 
and these men continued their former duties. The colored schools of 
the two cities were continued as a practically separate organization. 
In the act of Congress of 1878 providing a permanent government 
for the District the board of school trustees was abolished and all 
powers and duties formerly exercised by the old board of trustees 
were transferred to the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, to 
whom were given authority to employ such officers and agents and to 
adop{ such provisions as might be necessary to carry into execution 
the powers and duties imposed. 
The Commissioners were directed to appoint from time to time 19 
persons, actual residents of the District of Columbia, to constitute the 
trustees of the public schools of the District and to serve without
-P-A-G-E-125
  LAWS RELATING TO CITY SCHOOL BOARDS. 49 
compensation for such terms as the Commissioners might fix. These 
trustees were to have the powers and perform the duties in relation to 
the care and management of the public schools which were then author- 
ized by law." 
In 1882 the number of trustees was reduced to 9, and in 1895 it was 
increased to 11, its present number, that the Commissioners might 
appoint women on the board, as they were given authority to do. 
The trustees are now appointed for varying terms, fixed by the Com- 
missioners at the time of appointment. Their terms have ordinarily 
been fixed at three years, but of late the Commissioners have been mak- 
ing appointments for one year only. They may be removed at any time 
by the appointing power. ‘ 
The superintendents are appointees of the Commissioners, and may 
be removed at any time, that power having been given by law to the 
mayor and having descended through the governor to the present 
Board of Commissioners. 
The arrangement made by the board of trustees in respect to colored 
schools in 1874 continues to the present day, and there are two separate 
and distinct school systems in the same territory, having the ‘same 
board of trustees, but with different officers and separate organization 
in every respect that relates to instruction. 
The powers and duties of the present board of trustees are not 
clearly defined. The law of 1878 was peculiarly constructed. It gave 
to the District Commissioners all the powers of the old board of trus- 
tees, and in the very next paragraph gave to the new board of trustees 
the powers and duties relating to the care and management of the 
schools then authorized by law. 
This apparent contradiction has at different times given rise to diffi- 
culty and misunderstanding. In 1885-86 the then Commissioners 
advanced the theory that the trustees were merely their agents, and as 
such were responsible to them. They claimed and exercised the right 
to control even such minutiz as the assignment of teachers and their 
transfer from school to school. In this they were, supported by an 
opinion by the attorney for the District, who held that “whatever is 
necessary in the way of classification of pupils, grading schools, num- 
bers to each teacher, hours of assembling and length of session, the 
whole matter of discipline of schools, examination, promotion, criticism 
of teachers and methods of teaching, the courses of study, the books 
to be used, and perhaps other matters pertaining to the welfare of the 
schools are among the powers and duties of the trustees.” But, he 
said, their duties pertain “exclusively to the working power of the edu- 
cational machinery, which they neither supply, maintain, nor repair. 
Upon these important matters, supply and repair, their action is advi- 
sory only.” The Commissioners proposed to issue regulations of their 
  
1Act of June 11, 1878, in Supplement to Revised Statutes of the United States, 
1874-1891, pages 178, 179.
-P-A-G-E-126
  50 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
own in regard to the schools, which would definitely fix the status of 
the trustees, but never proceeded further than to make a few “sugges- 
tions.” Both the Commissioners and the trustees desired nothing more 
than the good of the schools, and their correspondence on the subject 
was without acrimony. A conference brought about an understanding, 
and no definite or final conclusion was reached as to the respective 
powers of the two bodies. 
But it is very certain that “the powers and duties relating to the 
care and management of the schools” possessed by the former boards 
were continued in the new one by the law of 1878, and it remains to 
discover the laws that defined those powers and duties. But even 
when they are discovered it would require a judicial decision to deter- 
mine which of them belong to the trustees under the “care and manage- 
ment” clause. 
The consolidated board of trustees of 1874 were governed by the 
laws covering the several boards which they succeeded. There is no 
doubt about that. But the search for the laws of the ancient boards 
is by no means easy in the present condition of affairs. It appears 
from a careful search, however, that the board of 1874 were governed in 
their relations to the white schools of Washington by the laws of the 
corporation of Washington passed in 1858, reenacted with two additions 
in 1869; in their relations with the white schools of Georgetown by an 
ordinance of the corporation of Georgetown passed in 1842; in their 
relations with the white and colored schools of the county by an act of 
Jongress passed in 1864, and in their relations with the colored schools 
of Washington and Georgetown by an act of Congress passed in 1862, 
The Georgetown ordinances of 1842 gave to the then “board of 
guardians” full power “to ‘provide for the keeping of schools and to 
manage the same for the public interest, to make such by-laws and 
regulations as they may deem best for the government of the schools, 
to elect and appoint the respective and necessary teachers from time 
to time, and fix their compensation.” ! 
Teachers were required to report.quarterly to the board of guardians 
and annually to the corporation through the board of guardians. It 
was made the duty of teachers to receive all children that might be 
sent to them by any member of the board of guardians, or by the trus- 
tees of the poor, any of whom were authorized to grant certificates of 
admission? 
The Washington board of 1858 received power to appoint all teachers 
authorized by law, and to change them at pleasure; to prescribe the 
course of studies and the books to be used, no book to be changed 
except by a vote of two-thirds of the whole board, and the books in all 
schools to be uniform; to make and execute by-laws, rules, and regula- 
tions for the management of the schools as they may deem necessary

and proper, a copy of which must occupy a conspicuous place in each 
schoolroom, and to alter, amend, and abrogate them at pleasure; to 
transact all business relating to the schools, subject to the laws of the 
corporation. They were required to cause an annual examination of 
all public schools to be made each July; to make an annual report to 
the common council; to divide themselves into as many subboards as 
there were school districts, for the exercise of a practical supervision 
over the schools, subject to the control of the board of trustees. The 
subboards were required to meet regularly once a month at least and to 
_ cause records to be kept by the principal teachers. All white children 
between 6 and 17 years old were to be admitted into the schools, pro- 
vided their parents or guardians were bona fide residents of the city. 
The male and female pupils were required to be kept separate, as far as 
practicable, during school hours and to have different places assigned 
to them for recreation.' ‘ 
The act of the city councils of September 7, 1869, made it the duty of 
the board of trustees to fix upon the time and manner of school exam- 
-inations and promotions, to select annually one of their number from 
each school district to be a committee for the examination of teachers, 
assisted by the superintendent, and to hold semiannually, in conjune- 
tion with the superintendent, a teachers’ institute.’ 
The duties of the school board of the county were written at a much 
later date than were those of the city boards, and have a more modern 
flavor. They were: to regulate the number of children to be taught 
in each school; to select, upon a thorough examination, such teachers 
as are competent, giving to each a certificate of qualification, without 
which no teacher is entitled to receive pay; to fix their salaries and 
terms of service; to-suspend or expel incorrigible pupils; to preseribe 
the course of study and the text-books to be used * * * and gen- 
erally to prescribe rules and regulations for the management, good 
government, and well-ordering of the schools, and to make an annual 
report. Any white resident was privileged to place his child or ward 
in any of the schools, with the consent of the board; and any colored 
resident had the same privilege with respect to cclored schools.’ : 
The trustees of the colored schools of the cities were directed to 
exercise the same functions and have the same supervision over the 
schools under their charge as were exercised over the public schools of 
the two cities by the trustees thereof by virtue of the laws and ordi- 
nances in foree in the two cities, respectively.* 
These, then, are presumably the laws which still govern the board 
of trustees. If there are any of later date I have not succeeded in 
finding them. It is very probable that even some of the present

  trustees themselves are not aware of the differences in their powers in 
relation to the schools of the several localities, for time has so welded 
together the various elements of the system that it is now one homo- 
geneous whole. Expediency first and custom afterwards prescribed 
that all schools should be treated alike, and the restrictions that 
relate to one section were and still are voluntarily applied by the 
board to all sections by means of regulations; for example, all teachers 
in the elementary schools not graduates of the city normal schools 
must have passed an examination and have received a certificate of 
fitness, though this is not required by law except for the teachers of 
the county; the legal provision requiring a two-thirds vote of the 
board to change a text-book applies only to Washington, but it is 
applied by regulation to the whole District, and text-books are uniform 
in all schools of like grade; the division of the board into subboards, 
. too, is required for Washington only, but it is applied in practice to 
the entire District. But there are now ten ‘“ divisions ” and only eleven 
trustees, so that but one division has more than one trustee, and the 
legal requirement for monthly meetings of the subboards has neces- 
sarily become a dead letter. 
Neither law nor custom requires that a trustee shall be a resident of 
the division for which he acts, but in a general way it is recognized as 
desirable that it should be so, and assignments are usually made with 
that in view. ; 
The peculiar relations of the District of Columbia to Congress has 
brought about the custom of legislation by appropriations. Congress 
has exclusive control of the District and is its only legislative body. 
When any extension of the school system is desired, therefore, the 
request for it is ordinarily in the form of an application for an appro- 
priation, which, if granted, carries with it the authority for the exten- 
sion. Itwas thus that the free text-book system was inaugurated, that 
the.fourth year was added to the high-school course, and, in fact, that 
all important extensions have been secured. 
The board of trustees annually submit estimates covering all their 
needs to the District Commissioners, who are in turn required by law 
to submit to the Secretary of the Treasury annually an itemized state- 
ment and estimate of the amount necessary to defray the expenses of 
the government of the District of Columbia for the next fiscal year. 
The Secretary of the Treasury must carefully consider all the estimates 
and must approve or disapprove, or suggest such changes as he may 
think the public interest demands. He must cause a statement to be 
made of the amount approved by him and the fund to which each item 
belongs, which statement must be certified by him and delivered, 
together with the original estimates, to the Commissioners of the Dis- 
trict of Columbia, who must transmit the same to Congress. To the 
extent to which Congress approves such estimates Congress appropri- 
ates the amount of 50 per cent thereof, and the remaining 50 per cent

of such approved estimates are levied and assessed upon the taxable 
property and privileges of the District other than the property of the 
United States and of the District of Columbia. 
The rate of taxation for all purposes for any one year may not exceed 
$1.50 on every $100. All taxes collected are paid into the Treasury 
of the United States, and the same, as well as the appropriations made 
by Congress as aforesaid, are disbursed for the expenses of the District 
on itemized vouchers, which must have been audited and approved by 
the auditor of the District of Columbia and certified by the Commis- 
sioners, or a majority of them.!

paid, but may not raise it, nor may they fix the salary of any teacher. 
The board of inspectors report annually upon the need of new buildings, 
specifying as nearly as possible the cost of the sites required as well as 
the probable cost of suitable buildings to be erected. If the condition 
of the school fund justifies it, the council, by a three-fourths vote, may 
order the mayor and the president of the board of school inspectors ° 
to proceed to obtain such site and erect a suitable building thereon, in 
accordance with plans and estimates to be provided by the board of 
inspectors. 
In erecting buildings the mayor and the president of the board of 
inspectors must advertise for proposals for furnishing material and 
labor, and contracts are let to the lowest bidder, said contracts being 
between the contractor and the city of St. Paul; all payments are made 
from the city treasury. Whenever any school building is ordered to be 
erected by the common council a building inspector is appointed by the 
mayor and confirmed by the council, whose duty it is to inspect the 
work upon the building, and who must report that the work has been 
done according to the plans and specifications before any requisition 
may be drawn for payment. When the building is completed he must 
make a final report to the council, specifying fully the kind and amount 
of material that has been used and the manner in which the building 
has been erected. 
The board of school inspectors do not purchase their own supplies, 
but each year they make a statement of what is desired for the ensuing 
year, and a committee, consisting of the mayor of the city, the president 
of the common council, and the city treasurer, advertise for and pur- 
chase them. 
The board of inspectors may make no debts except for the monthly 
salaries of teachers and for current expenses in the case of school 
buildings, and then only to the extent and in the manner herein speci- 
fied. They have the care, custody, and control of schoolhouses, and 
appoint janitors and watchmen for the same. The police department 
of the city is especially charged with the protection of school property 
in every respect. The title to all property pertaining to the public 
schools of the city is vested in the city of St. Paul in trust for the uses 
and purposes of education solely. 
The board of inspectors have full power to employ and dismiss 
teachers, and the city council have no control over them in that respect. 
Teachers serve during the pleasure of the board of inspectors, and 
after one year of successful service are not subject to annual elections.

  District No.1, ARAPAHOE CouNTY (DENVER), CoLo.1 
There are three separate school organizations in the limits of the city 
of Denver, known, respectively, as Districts No. 1, No. 2, and No. 17,

and disburses the same on the order of the president of the board, 
eountersigned by the secretary. He must keep account of all receipts 
and expenditures, render such statements as the board may require, 
and give bond for the faithful discharge of his duties.

the purpose of building schoolhouses in the district. Such tax must be 
made by a two-thirds vote of the members of the board, and must 
be collected by the county collector at the same time and in the same 
manner as county taxes, and, when collected, it must be paid to the 
treasurer of the board. 
The beard of education must also annually determine what sums of 
money will be required in addition to their quota of the State school 
fund for the current expenses of the schools for the ensuing year, and 
they report the sum so required to the board of county commissioners, 
who must levy and collect the same as a tax upon all taxable property 
of the district. But such tax must not exceed 3 mills on the dollar of 
assessed valuation. The money, when collected, is paid to the treasurer 
of the board of education. 
The title to all lands, houses, and other property used for school pur- 
poses in the district is vested in the board of education, and they. have 
full power to sell, lease, and convey any such Jands and tenements if

and apparatus; to Select and purchase sites; to hire or erect buildings 
and keep them in repair; to employ teachers; to fix the salaries of 
superintendent, secretary, and: teachers; to determine what branches 
of instruction shall be taught; and to determine on what terms pupils 
living outside the district shall be admitted to the schools. 
The board of education must annually elect a superintendent of 
schools to serve one year from the time of his appointment. It is his 
duty to have oversight of all public schools in the district; to examine 
applicants for teacherships, and grant certificates to those found quali- 
fied; to visit the schools, observe the discipline, mode of teaching, 
progress of pupils, and such other matters as he may deem of interest, 
and to report thereon to the board of education, and to perform such

INDIANAPOLIs, IND,! 
The city is divided into eleven school districts by the board of school 
commissioners, and the qualified electors of each district elect one 
school commissioner to serve for three years, the terms being so 
arranged that one-third of the whole number of commissioners are 
elected each year. 
The number and boundaries of the districts may be changed by the 
board of school commissioners at any time, and if the number is increased

  each additional district is entitled to elect one school commissioner. 
Vacancies occurring at any time prior to the annual election are filled 
by the board till the next annual election. 
The election takes place annually on the second Saturday in June, 
and on the first Monday in July following the school commissioners 
assemble and organize by the election of a president, a treasurer, and 
a secretary, all of whom must be of their own number. Meetings are 
held at such times as the board may determine, and a record must be 
kept of all their proceedings. The members serve without compensa- 
tion. The board of school commissioners are authorized— 
(1) To district the city for the purpose of electing school commis- 
sioners and for general school purposes. 
(2) To levy all taxes for the support of the schools in the city, in 
addition to the State taxes; but no such tax may exceed 25 cents on 
each $100 of taxable property for purchasing grounds, building school- 
houses, and furnishing supplies therefor, or 25 cents on each $100 for 
the payment of teachers. 
(3) To levy a tax of not over 2 cents on $100 for the support of free

CHARLESTON, 8. C.! 
The city is divided into six school districts, each embracing two wards, 
and at every municipal election (i. e., every four years) there is elected 
by the legal voters of eavh district one school commissioner. The six 
school commissioners so elected, with two appointed by the governor? for 
the same term upon the recommendation of the board of trustees of the 
High School of Charleston and two others similarly appointed upon the 
recommendation of the board of trustees of the College of Charleston,? 
constitute the school board of the city of Charleston. 
The commissioners so elected and appointed may assemble at any 
time and elect a chairman, a clerk, and a superintendent of city schools, 
whose terms of office, duties, and compensation are prescribed by the 
board; but their terms of office may not exceed that of the board elect- 
ing them. i 
Vacancies in the board caused by death, resignation, departure from 
the State, or refusal to qualify are filled by the board from the same 
wards in which they occur. 
The city treasurer must annually levy and collect, at the same time as 
the city taxes, a tax of 1 mill on the dollar on all taxable property in the 
city; and the county treasurer must pay over to the city treasurer 
the portion of the State school taxes to which the Charleston school 
district is entitled, and all of said taxes are deposited in the treasury as 
public money, to be paid out on the warrant of the city board of school 
commissioners. The said moneys are to be applied to the support of 
the city schools and to the repairs of the city school buildings.® 
The city treasurer is entitled to receive out of the school moneys 
$500 a year for receiving and disbursing the school fund. 
The school board are empowered, and it is their duty, to determine the 
studies and books to be used in the city schools; to cause examina- 
tions to be made of teachers; to elect and dismiss teachers, prescribe 
their duties and terms of office, and to make rules for the government 
of the schools; to fill vacancies among their own number; to grant 
diplomas in the normal school department, which entitle holders to 
become teachers; to make an annual report to the State superintend- 
ent; to take charge of all school property belonging to or used by the 
city and to keep the same in order; to select by competitive examina-

4The tax of 1 mill on the dollar specified by law can not be increased or reduced 
either by the city council or the school commissioners. It can be changed only by 
the legislature. 
5New school buildings are erected by the commissioners with funds raised by spe- 
eial tax, which must be authorized by the legislature in each case.

unable to pay for the same, to recommend them to be received into the 
High School of Charleston, and to pay their tuition fees if admitted. 
Such pupils are entitled upon graduation to free honorary scholarships| 
in the College of Charleston. 
HARTFORD, Conn.} 
The schools of Hartford are still conducted under genéral laws de- 
signed primarily for rural communities. They have no connection with 
the city of Hartford as such, but are affairs of the town (or township) 
of Hartford and of the districts into which the town is divided. There 
are 10 of these school districts, varying greatly in size, population, and 
wealth, and consequently in the efficiency and relative cost of their 
schools. 
The town has the power to form, unite, alter, and dissolve school 
districts within its limits, and may abolish all school districts and itself| 
assume control of all the schools, constituting one school district; but 
this consolidation may be accomplished only by the majority of the votes 
cast at an election duly held to decide the question. Consolidation has 
several times been submitted to a vote of the people and has each time 
been voted down by large majorities. At the last election, held in 1874, 
out of about 7,000 votes cast the majority against consolidation was 
over 2,500. The stronger districts are opposed to giving their money 
to aid in the support of schools in the weaker districts, and the weaker 
districts seem to desire to retain the direct management of their own 
affairs, for in only 1 out of the 10 districts did consolidation receive a 
majority of the votes. 
The direction of the affairs of the schools is divided between (1) the 
legal voters of the town in town meeting assembled, (2) the selectmen 
of the town, who are officers with general duties, (3) the town board of 
school visitors, (4) the joint board of selectmen and school visitors, (5) 
the high-school committee, (6) the legal voters of the respective districts 
in district meeting, and (7) the district committees. 
The powers and duties of theseseveral bodies are not defined with suffi- 
cient precision to prevent misunderstandings and conflict of authority, 
as an examination of the school reports shows; but such difficulties do 
not appear to have been serious enough to interfere with the harmonious 
conduct of the schools, and have not been greater than in some other 
places having less complicated arrangements. They have certainly not 
been sufficient to cause a popular demand for a change strong enough 
to alter the system. 
Public schools must be maintained for thirty-six weeks in each year 
in every school district in which the number of persons between 4 and

16 years of age is 50 or more, and at least thirty weeks in other dis- 
tricts. In said schools there shall be taught, by teachers found duly 
qualified by the school visitors, reading, spelling, writing, English 
grammar, geography, physiology, and hygiene with special reference 
to stimulants and narcotics, and such other studies, including training 
in manual arts, as may be prescribed by the board of visitors. 
The schools must be open. to all children over 4 years old in the 
respective districts without discrimination on account of race or color; 
but children under 5 may be excluded whenever the board of school 
visitors so determine. In practice, children residing in one district and 
attending school in another pay tuition. 
THE TOWN. 
  High schools—The town may [and does] maintain schools of high 
grade, and for such purpose may purchase, hold, and convey property, 
build schoolhouses, lay taxes, and adopt regulations for the manage- 
ment of such schools. The town may choose by ballot a committee of 
five residents of the town who have all the powers and duties in rela- 
tion to such schools-that district committees have in relation to district 
schools. No voter may vote for more than three members of the high- 
school committee, and the five persons receiving the highest number of 
votes are elected. If the town fail to elect a high-school cominittee, 
the school visitors must appoint such committee. 
The board of school visitors must prescribe rules for admission of 
pupils to the high school, for their studies, books, and classification; 
examine and certificate teachers for the same; revoke certificates of 
incompetent teachers, and visit the school at least twice each term. 
Evening schools.—The town must establish and maintain public even- 
ing schools; the board of school visitors have supervision over them. 
The board of visitors must annually certify to the comptroller of the 
State the average number of pupils attending evening schools within 
the current school year and the comptroller thereupon draws his order 
on the State treasurer in favor of the board of visitors, for the use of 
schools, in the sum of $2.25 for each pupil so certified, and the State 
treasurer must pay the same on presentation. Evening schools to be 
entitled to this distribution must have been open for at least seventy- 
five evenings during the school year. The school visitors must report 
annually to the State board of education concerning evening schools. 
Kindergartens.—The town or any district may maintain kindergarten 
schools for pupils over 3 and under 7 years of age. In Hartford the 
kindergartens are supported by the respective districts. 
Miscellaneous provisions.—The town at its annual meeting may direct 
the board of school visitors to employ special teachers of music for all 
districts, their salaries to be paid by the town, and it may direct the 
school visitors to provide at the expense of the town the text-books 
and supplies for the use of pupils.

68 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Women are entitled to vote at school elections and are not debarred. 
by their sex from membership in the board of school visitors or the dis- 
trict committees. Separate ballot boxes must be provided for women’s 
ballots at all elections in which they may vote. 
Other business transacted by the town at town meeting is mentioned 
in different connections in succeeding paragraphs, especially in relation 
to finances. 
THE SELECTMEN. 
The selectmen have the management of any property pertaining to 
the schools and belonging to the town, and must lodge with the treas- 
urer all bonds and securities not intrusted to others by the grantor, 
and all moneys which they may receive for the use of the schools. 
It is the duty of the selectmen to cause the boundary lines of school 
districts to be entered on the records of the town; to designate the 
time, place, and object of holding the first meeting in any new dis- 
trict; to provide each schoolhouse in the town with a United States 
flag, to be displayed every school day when the weather will permit. 
The name, number, and limits of every school district must be entered 
on its records and on the records of the town. 
The selectmen of the town define boundaries -of districts when not 
clearly settled and define boundaries of new districts. When the 
selectmen can not agree, the town may appoint three indifferent per- 
sons for that purpose. 
At least fifteen days’ notice ae be given when it is proposed to 
alter the boundary of any district. Appeal may be had to the superior 
court by any district aggrieved by any action of the town in this con- 
nection. 
  JOINT BOARD OF SELECTMEN AND SCHOOL VISITORS—FINANCES. 
The selectmen and the school visitors must meet annually as a joint 
board and prepare estimates of the cost of each and all the schools for 
the next school year, and they must at once notify the several district 
committees of the amounts so fixed. These estimates must be pre- 
sented to the town at the next annual town meeting, together with a 
report of the expenses of the last year. 
The rate of taxation and the sum of money to be appropriated for 
schools are determined by the town in town meeting. The joint board 
of selectmen and school visitors must divide between the several dis- 
tricts each year the moneys appropriated by the town for wages of 
teachers, fuel, and incidental expenses, and must notify each district 
committee of the amounts apportioned to them. 
If the amount spent in any district exceed the amount fixed upon 
for that district by the joint board, the said board must meet to decide 
whether the expense was necessary. If they decide that it was neces- 
sary, the selectmen must draw an order on the town treasurer to pay the
-P-A-G-E-145
LAWS RELATING TO CITY SCHOOL BOARDS. 69 
  same; if not, the amount must be paid by the district unless the town 
order otherwise. 
The town is not required to expend more for school purposes than is 
produced by a tax of 1 mill on the dollar. But the full sum must be 
paid to the several school districts in proportion to the number of 
school children in the several districts. 
When the cost of the schools in any district is greater than the 
sum received from the town, the excess must be met by a tax laid by 
the district. 
Tie joint board of selectmen and school visitors have power to appro- 
priate money for the purchase of books and apparatus for the public 
school of the town. The money is expended by a committee of the 
school visitors; the State contributes annually $5 for each 100 pupils 
in the schools, to be used for the same purpose. 
The moneys apportioned to Connecticut in the distribution by the 
United States of the surplus in 1837 was divided between the towns of 
the State, and forms what is known as the “town deposit fund.” The- 
principal of this fund must be kept intact and the income used solely 
for the support of schools. 
Each district committee, or their clerk, must annually make an enu- 
meration of all children belonging to the district, and must make return 
of the same to the school visitors. If the district committee fail to do 
this, one of the school visitors must make the enumeration. 
The school visitors must examine and correct the returns and for- 
ward them to the State comptroller. 
The State school moneys are divided between the districts on the 
basis of the enumeration, but no district may receive State money 
unless the school visitors certify that schools have been kept therein 
in accordance with law. No district may receive money from the State 
or town unless it has a schoolhouse satisfactory to the school visitors. 
No schoolhouse may be built except according to a plan approved 
by the school visitors and by the building committee of the district, 
nor at an expense greater than the sum appropriated therefor by the 
district. 
School districts have the right of condemning land required for school 
purposes. 
THE BOARD OF SCHOOL VISITORS. 
There is for the town a board of school visitors of nine members, 
three of whom are elected each year in town meeting by the legal 
voters of the town for a term of three years. The election is by ballot, 
each voter being allowed to vote for two members only, the three per- 
sons receiving the highest number of votes being declared elected. In 
case of a tie, that person whose name is first on the greatest number of 
ballots is elected. 
Should any vacancy occur, the remaining members of the board may 
fill it till the next annual election, when the ballots must distinctly 
specify the vacaney to be filled.
-P-A-G-E-146
  70 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The board of school visitors must annually choose from themselves a 
chairman and a secretary. The chairman of the board of school visit- 
ors, or, in ease of his absence or inability to act, the secretary, must call 
a meeting of the board at least once in six months, and whenever the 
chairman deems necessary, or is requested in writing to do so by three 
members. If no meeting is called -within fourteen days after such 
request, one may be called by three members, by giving written notice 
to the others. 
The secretary must keep a record of the proceedings of the board 
and make to the town and to the State board of education annual 
written. reports. 
The board of school visitors must prescribe rules for the manage- 
ment, studies, classification, and discipline of the public schools, and, 
subject to the control of the State board of education, the text-books 
to be used. The board of school visitors may not change any text- 
book used in the schools except by a two-thirds vote and after one 
week’s notice. They must, as a board, or by a committee appointed by 
them, examine all persons desiring to teach in the public schools and 
give to each person found qualified a certificate, authorizing the holder 
to teach in any of the schools of the town, or only in the district. speci- 
fied, for such time as may be stated in the certificate. They must 
revoke the certificate of any teacher found incompetent to teach or to. 
manage a school. No teacher may be employed who has not received 
@ certificate of approbation of the school visitors, and no teacher is 
entitled to receive pay who does not properly keep a school register. 
If the town so direct, the board of visitors must employ the teachers 
for all its publie schools, after consulting the several district commit-- 
tees; but the town has not so directed, and the employment of teachers: 
is still in the hands of the district committees. 
The board have authority to require that every child shall be vae- 
einated before entering school, and if the parents of any child are not 
able to pay for the same the town must bear the expense, on the recom- 
mendation of the board. 
»+ It is the duty of the board of school visitors to make rules for the 
school libraries provided in part by the State and to approve the books 
selected therefor; to fill vacancies in district offices, fix sites, and 
approve plans for schoolhouses, and superintend the high school; to 
enforce the laws relating to the employment of children and to com- 
pulsory education; to receive reports fron: school district officers; to 
inspect school buildings and to approve sites and plans for new build- 
ings; to examine the returns of enumeration of persons 4 to 16 years of 
age made by district committees and forward the same: to the State 
eomptroller, certifying at the same time what schools have been kept 
according to law; to meet with the selectmen of the town each year as 
a joint board to prepare estimates to be subnyitted to the town meeting,

to pass upon expense of districts in excess of amount appropriated by 
the town; to give certificates to the selectmen as to whether the dis- 
trict schools have been kept according to law; to regulate, in connection 
with district committees, the admission of nonresident pupils; to pass 
upon the union of small schools; to investigate the sanitary condition 
of schoolhouses. The board of school visitors must make returns 
annually to the State comptroller of the number of persons 4 to 16 years 
of age in the town, and the president and secretary must draw on the 
comptroller for the amount of State school money due the town. 
At the close of each term the school visitors must certify to the town 
selectmen whether each school has been kept according to law. 
The board annually assign the duty of visiting the schools of the fown 
to one of their number, who is called superintendent of public schools. 
He must visit the schools, examine the schoolhouses and outbuildings, 
school register, and library, and investigate the studies, discipline, 
mode of teaching, and general condition of the schools, He must sub- 
mit annually to the board a written report of the several schools, with 
plans and suggestions for their improvement. The compensation of 
the superintendent is fixed by the town. 
The board of school visitors have authority to appoint a person not of 
their own number to be superintendent of schools, his salary to be fixed 
by the town; but up to this time the superintendent has been a mem- 
ber of the board of visitors. 
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. 
Each school district is a body corporate and has the power to sue and 
be sued, to purchase, hold, and convey real and personal property for 
school purposes; to build, hire, and repair schoolhouses, and supply 
them with fuel, furniture, etc.; to establish schools; to purchase appa- 
ratus; to maintain a school library; to employ teachers, except when 
the town may direct the school visitors to employ the teachers, and 
must pay the wages of teachers employed by the district committee;

regulations for establishing and conducting schools not inconsistent 
with the regulations of the town. 
Each school district must hold an annual meeting each June for the 
choice of officers and for the transaction of any other business relating 
to schools. Special meetings may be held whenever duly called. 
District meetings must be held in the district, preferably in the dis- 
trict schoolhouse, and due notice must be given of each meeting. 
Every meeting may choose its own moderator. 
In districts in which there are four hundred or more children enu-

call one at the request of ten voters of the district. It is their duty to 
appoint teachers unless the town otherwise directs; to provide suitable

pupils unable to buy them; to suspend or expel pupils guilty of incor- 
rigibly bad conduct; to give such information and assistance to the 
school visitors as they may require; to report annually to the school 
visitors; to cause an enumeration to be made annually of all the chil- 
dren in the district between 4 and 16 years of age. 
  THE City oF SAVANNAH AND THE CouUNTY oF CHATHAM, GA.) 
The board of education is a self-perpetuating close corporation. In 
the acts establishing the public-school system, nine persons were des- 
ignated by name who, with the ‘commissioners of the Massie school” 
appointed under the ordinances of the city, constituted the board of 
public education of the city of Savannah and the county of Chatham, 
and under that name they were created a body politic and corporate 
with perpetual succession of members. They received full power to 
establish and modify from time to time a plan and system of education 
for all children in the city and county between the ages of 6 and 18 
years, and to superintend the same; to appoint, suspend, and remove 
teachers, and provide schoolhouses; to make by-laws, rules, and regu- 
lations for their own government and for the government of the teachers 
and schools; to designate and elect officers of the board, and to fill 
vacancies (except among the commissioners of the Massie school) in any

  manner whatever caused, either among officers or members of the board; 
to acquire, hold, or sell real or personal property, and to have the usual 
powers and privileges of corporations necessary for carrying out the 
purposes of their creation, They receive all money allotted to the 
county of Chatham from the State school fund, all the county educa- 
tional funds, and such sums as may be appropriated by the city council 
of Savannah for schools, and expend the same at their discretion; but 
the money appropriated by the city council may not be used for the 
county schools. 
The Massie school referred to in the acts mentioned was established 
in 1855, as the result of a legacy of $5,000 to the city council in trust 
for the maintenance of common schools of the city. 
The city ordinances provide that there shall be three commissioners 
of the Massie school, to be appointed annually by the mayor, subject 
to the confirmation of the council. The mayor himself must be one of 
the three unless he is already a member of the board of education. 
The other two may be selected either from the board of aldermen or 
from the citizens at large, or from both. They unite with and form a 
part of the board of education, and are subject to its by-laws, rules, 
and regulations.

Development of local government since 1832 and bearings upon the dill; The vill a

The most important event of the year as regards education in Eng- 
land is the endeavor to secure the passage of a new education bill 
which was introduced into the House of Commons early in April by 
its author, Sir John Gorst, vice-president of the education department. 
The bill was the immediate outcome of promises of further aid to 
parochial (voluntary) schools made during the campaign of 1895 by 
the leaders of the Conservative party. It had, however, other and 
deeper purposes, as avowed by its author and supporters. It was an 
ambitious endeavor to reorganize the local administration of educa- 
tion on the lines of recent reforms in local government in general, and. 
with a view to the more efficient control and coordination of elementary, 
secondary, and technical instruction. However desirable these ends 
may be in themselves, the measures proposed for their accomplishment 
were apparently not drawn with due regard to existing conditions, and 
they were the more obnoxious because weighted with proposals favor- 
ing sectarian ascendancy in the schools. Although supported at the 
outset by an immense majority, the bill met with united and uncompro- — 
mising opposition from the Liberals and Nonconformists, who regarded 
it as a covert attack upon borough rights and religious freedom. At 
the same time the amount and the character of the relief provided for 
parochial schools failed to satisfy the demands of the Conservatives. 
In spite, however, of conflicting councils and vehement opposition, the 
pill was carried to its second reading, May 5, by the very large majority 
of 267, hence its sudden collapse in the second week of the committee 
debate was an event entirely unexpected. 
In withdrawing the bill Mr. Balfour? intimated that its consideration 
would be resumed in January (1897), but it is generally understood that

    80 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
the bill is dead and that the Government has lost the opportunity ot 
expanding its educational policy as required by present exigencies. 
Although it failed as a legislative measure, the bill has a lasting his- 
toric importance. In the light of its provisions and of the discussions 
that it provoked, the actual state of popular education in England and 
the changes that have taken place in public sentiment and in the con- 
stitution of local authorities since the system of elementary education 
was established are distinctly shown. The main purposes of the bill, 
namely, the reform of educational administration and the further relief 
of voluntary schools, were not suddenly conceived. They were the 
slowly developing and natural outcome of causes that had long been 
gathering force. To understand the historical bearings of the defeated 
measure we must look for a moment, first, to the educational system as 
constituted in 1870, and second, to the progress of local government 
during the past fifty years. 
Since it became a matter of Government concern, the development of 
popular education has been closely related to political reforms. The 
passage of the reform bill of 1832 was followed the next year by the 
first grant ($100,000) from the public treasury in aid of elementary 
instruction, the second reform bill, that of 1867, which greatly extended 
the franchise among the working classes, was a direct cause of the 
education law of 1870, while, as we shall presently see, the more recent 
laws affecting local government are intimately related to the educa- 
tion bill under consideration. 
_ The existing system of elementary education dates from the law of 
1870, but prior to the passage of that law the Government had devel- 
oped a very definite policy in respect to this great interest. 
It began with the money grant of 1833. The organized efforts for 
public education.at the time were in charge of two societies, the 
“British and Foreign School Society” and the “‘ National Society for 
Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Chureh 
of England.” These two societies had succeeded in arousing deep and 
widespread conviction of the necessity of public education; they had 
established many schools and received annually large sums in volun- 
tary subscriptions for their support. Through these two societies the 
annual Government appropriations for education were at first distrib- 
uted. In 1839 a committee of the Privy Council was established to 
administer the grants, which were raised at the time to $150,000 per 
annum. Aid from the grants was confined to schools in relation with 
one or the other of the societies named until 1847. In that year the 
Roman Catholics and Wesleyan Methodists were admitted to share in 
the appropriation upon specified conditions. The committee made the 
daily reading of Scripture obligatory in assisted schools and required: 
further that they should be open to the inspection of Government 
officers. 
The growing interest of the Government was manifested, not by
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 81 
increased grants alone, but equally by the increased scope of its action. 
In 1843 Parliamentary aid to education was extended by grants for 
teachers’ residences, the erection of training colleges which the societies 
and denominations were ready to maintain, and at the same time by 
special grants to aid poor and populous districts in their efforts to 
maintain schools. In 1846 the policy of Government aid in respect to the 
training of teachers was developed on the lines maintained to the present 
time, additional grants were offered to teachers who passed examina- 
tion before’ Government inspectors, grants were allowed for pupil 
teachers, and ‘Queen’s scholarships” were founded for those who 
entered training colleges. 
As the work extended, the need of more formal organization became 
urgent, and in 1860 the central committee began a movement in this 
direction by collecting and systematizing the minutes that had been 
issued from time to time for the guidance of those who sought to share 
in the Parliamentary grant. This body of regulations was called the 
“code.” The following year these regulations were extensively altered 
and developed into what is known as the “revised code,” associated 
with the name of the Right Hon. Robert Lowe, who introduced the 
famous policy of ‘payment upon results.” By this provision the greater 
part of the grant to any school was made upon the average attendance 
and the results of the examination of individual pupils in the three 
elementary branches. The effect that this policy would have in reduc- 
ing instruction to a narrrow mechanical grind was certainly not 
foreseen by its author. His purpose was undoubtedly to allay denom- 
inational jealousies by provisions that would limit the Government 
aid to purely secular branches and further to insure a positive appre- 
ciable result from the outlay of public money. 
Codes are still issued annually by the education department, and as 
they must be sanctioned by Parliament they have the binding force 
of law. 
From this brief survey it appears that the Government began its 
active work in behalf of popular education by fostering denominational 
schools, although its efforts were wholly directed to securing the essen- 
tial conditions of effective secular instruction. The system had free 
course for nearly forty years, but failed to meet the ever-growing 
demands for universal education. Illiteracy increased, while the 
extension of popular suffrage and the conditions of modern industry 
increased its evil effects. The Christian conscience of England and 
the civic apprehension were aroused; the opportune moment was seized 
by Mr. Forster and his colleagues for establishing a national system of 
education. In the debate on the first reading of the education bill 
of 1870 Mr. Forster stated that about 1,500,000 children were educated 
more or less imperfectly by the existing agencies; that is, they were 
“on the registers.” His estimates showed particularly that ‘only 
two-fifths of the children of the working classes between the ages of
-P-A-G-E-158
  82 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
6 and 10 years were on the registers of the Government schools, and 
only one-third of those between the ages of 10 and 12. Consequently, ~ 
of those between 6 and 10 about 700,000, more or less, were helped, 
and 1,000,000 were left without help, while of those between 10 and 12 
250,000 were helped and at least 500,000 were left unhelped ”—that is, 
about 1,500,000 of the children of the working classes were neglected. 
Not only had private initiative failed to secure the instruction of all 
children, but it appeared further “that where State help had been 
most wanted State help had been least given, and that where it was 
desirable that State power should be most felt it was not felt at all.” 
Even in view of these conditions it was not proposed to antagonize 
the work in progress. ‘Our object,” said Mr. Forster, ‘‘is to complete 
the present voluntary system, to fill up gaps.” 
The main principles insisted upon in the new measure were “ legal 
enactment that there shall be efficient schools everywhere throughout 
the Kingdom” and “compulsory provision of such schools if, and where, 
needed, but not unless proved to be needed.” 
Following long-established precedents in England, it was proposed 
that the Government should accomplish this purpose through local 
agencies, and following the tendency of the time, it was determined that 
the new agencies should be elected by the legal voters; hence the new 
machinery which the law of 1870 called into being consisted of school 
boards elected in their respective districts. 5 
The school boards, once constituted, became the media for the distri- 
bution of the public grant to board schools on the same terms as the 
managers of voluntary schools. The boards had, however, one privi- 
lege in which their rivals did not share—they were empowered to claim 
or to levy rates (local property taxes) for the maintenance of elementary 
schools; in other words, a system of what are called in America public 
schools was set up side by side with the voluntary or parochial system. 
The board schools were also subject to one restriction that did not apply 
to “‘voluntary” schools. In addition to the restraining influence of a 
“conscience clause,” which was applicable to all schools, they were for- 
bidden to teach any “‘religious catechism or religious formulary which 
is distinctive of any particular denomination.” 
Furthermore, the school boards were empowered to borrow money on 
the security of the school fund for the purpose of building, enlarging, 
or furnishing schoolhouses. In each case the consent of the education 
department was necessary. Payment might be spread over a period 
of fifty years, and the public works loan commission was authorized, 
on recommendation of the education department, to loan the money 
required. 
Beyond these three provisions, the two classes of schools were on 
the same footing and were classed together as State-aided elementary 
schools. 
The development of this dual system has been in some respects phe- 
nomenal. In 1870, when the board schools had just begun operations,  
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 83 
the Government inspection showed that provision had been made in 
State-aided schools for 1,878,584 pupils, or 8.75 per cent of the popula- 
tion. In 1894 there was accommodation for 5,832,944 pupils, or 19.44 
per cent of the population. Of the additional accommodation provided 
since 1870, voluntary schools furnished 1,755,249 places, an increase of 
93 per cent, and board schools 2,199,111 places. The enrollment in 
the schools the same year (1894) was 5,198,741 pupils and the average 
attendance 4,225,834, a gain in the latter item of 268 per cent since 
1870. 
The increase in the number of teachers is still greater, reaching 276 
per cent. The increase in these particulars has been accompanied by 
an expansion of the ideal of popular education. 
Progress in this respect has been forced by the ever-increasing 
demand for skilled labor, and has naturally been most marked in the 
great manufacturing centers. Mr. Mundella, for many years the active 
head of the education department, well understood the intimate rela- 
tion between education and industrial advance, and succeeded in 
making a break through the narrow lines of the “revised code.” The 
merit grant determined by the general conditions of the schools was 
introduced by him in 1882, and at the same time more liberal grants 
were allowed for the higher subjects. The result was a rapid exten 
sion of the curricula of board schools (especially on the science side) 
in all the chief cities, and a corresponding improvement in the teach- 
ing force and in teaching appliances. The pride and self-interest of 
citizens were stimulated, and the boards were supported in the large 
expenditures, whose burden fell necessarily upon the local taxes. 
The voluntary schools found themselves distanced in the race, cries 
of “Extravagance!” were raised against the boards by their rivals, 
and demands made for additional aid to parochial schools. 
The final abandonment in 1890 of the principle of “payment upon 
resuits,” and the law of 1891 providing. a grant in lieu of fees for all 
schools remitting the same, increased the tension. The former policy 
gaye distinct advantages to schools having the largest resources, and 
the latter stimulated efforts in behalf of a universal system of board 
schools. e 
The law of 1870, as it finally passed, bore every mark of compromise, 
but it was this in no mean sense; extreme views had simply given way 
to considerations of the public welfare. It was foreseen that the two 
classes of school managers and of schools recognized under the law, i. e., 
the voluntary and the public, were likely to clash at some future time, 
but the outcome was wisely left to circumstances; no endeavor was 
made to hamper the development of either class. As we have already 
noted, the friction between the two classes of schools and the inequality 
of their resources were principal causes of the late futile effort to recast 
the system. Another not less important and yastly more intricate 
cause of the endeavor is found in the constitution of school districts,
-P-A-G-E-160
  84 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The disturbances that were likely to arise from this source were also 
foreseen by the advocates of the original law (1870). That law made 
every borough subject to the municipal corporations act of 1835, a school 
district, and in the country every civil parish! (i. e., district for which 
a separate poor rate is or may be levied), but its author was careful to 
state both the reasons for and the objections to this choice.2 The 
adjustment of school districts is part of the great problem of local 
administration whose solution has been one of the chief ends of legis- 
lative action for more than half a century. To understand the principal 
1The 40 English and 12 Welsh counties are divided into 14,946 poor-law or civil 
parishes, i.e., districts in each of which a separate poor rate may be levied; but the 
same ground is covered by about 13,000 ecclesiastical parishes, and again by 14,777 
highway parishes; nor is this enumeration exhaustive. These divisions have been 
_ made at different times and for various purposes, without any regard to previous 
boundaries. Moreover, the units of a division may be combined; thus, for purposes 
of poor-law administration the civil parishes are formed into 649 unions, 25 of which 
are single parish unions. It is desirable to have this fact in mind on account of the 
relation of parishes and unions to school boards. 
2With respect to the area Mr. Forster said: ‘For this we take present known 
divisions and declare them to be school districts, so that upon the passing of this 
bill there will be no portion of England or Wales not included in one school district 
oranother. * * * We have taken the boundaries of boroughs as regards towns 
and parishes as regards the country, and when I say parish I mean the civil parish, 
and not the ecclesiastical district. * * * As regards towns, I think there can bo 
but little doubt. Almost every one will jump to the conclusion that in boroughs we 
should take the municipal boundaries, but there may be a difference of opinion as to 
the rural districts. The education bills hitherto brought forward have taken the 
union; we take the parish, with the power, of course, to unite parishes together. 
There are several reasons why we prefer the parish to the union, though it is a very 
difficult matter to decide upon, and there is much to be said on both sides. In the first 
place, there is a vast difference between the condition of town and country with 
respect to education. Any bill to be successful must be elastic to meet that differ- 
ence. Take the parish in the country, and we at once admit the possibility of that 
difference and make the bill elastic, being in this way able to treat town and coun- 
try in a different manner. Again, in a country district, the principle of our billis 
better fitted to a small unit of area, because we do not intend to meddle with a dis- 
trict that can safely be left to itself. Another reason is that many unions through- 
out the Kingdom are composed of a town surrounded by outlying country parishes. 
Well, if we had to take the town out of the union it would be like taking the kernel 
out of the nut, and making our organization almost impossible. It would be neces- 
sary either to have a school board to meet these conflicting or at least entirely differ- 
ent conditions, or you would be obliged to contend with the disadvantage of taking 
out the central and more populous district and of trying to join together by them- 
selves the outlying parishes. * * * I cannot leave this point without just alluding 
to the reason why we have this difficulty at all, which is almost a disgrace to this 
country. Weare behind almost every other civilized country, whether in America 
or on the continent of Europe, in respect to rural municipal organization, and this 
drawback meets us not only in connection with education, but when many other 
social questions affecting the people come before us. The same difficulty applies to 
London. With respect to London, as I have already said, we have taken the best 
divisions we could find—the school districts as already established, which, I believe, 
are working well, and cover nearly the whole metropolis. Where these districts do 
not exist we take the boundaries of the vestries.”   
 
-P-A-G-E-161
THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 85 
‘proposition of the defeated school law it is necessary to refer to a 
series of acts dealing with this problem. 
The reform law of 1832, as summed up by Green, “took away the 
right of representation from 56 decayed or rotten boroughs, gave the 
143 members they returned to counties or large towns which as yet 
sent no members to Parliament, established a £10 householder qualifi- 
cation for voters in boroughs, and extended the county franchise to 
leaseholders and copyholders.” The new privileges accelerated the 
growth of the civic spirit in large towns and led directly to the munici- 
pal corporations act of 1835, which, to quote again from Mr. Green, 
“yvestored to the inhabitants of towns those rights of self-government 
of which they had been deprived since the fourteenth century.” The 
towns, or, as they are technically termed, municipal boroughs,! became, 
as we have seen, school districts under the law of 1870. Subsequent 
laws, especially that of 1882, have amended and extended the powers 
conferred upon the boroughs by the act of 1835. These laws, however, 
only reached a single factor of the problem of local government. There 
remained to be dealt with a bewildering maze of areas, authorities, 
privileges, and responsibilities. The situation is indicated—to describe. 
it would be impossible—by the following passages in an article by Mr. 
Thring: “Local government,” he says, “is perhaps the most difficult 
problem which presents itself for solution to the English statesman. 
Take one county alone for an example. The county of Somerset con- 
tains 497 parishes, 11 boroughs, 22 unions, 10 local government districts, 
17 rural sanitary districts, 66 school-board districts, besides numerous 
highway districts. Each of these divisions is governed by a separate 
body with distinct powers, and elected, with but few exceptions, by 
separate constituencies, separate modes of voting, and at different 
times of year. Multiply these authorities by 52, the number of counties 
in England—and bear in mind that a scheme of local government 
involves a knowledge of the particulars of each of the above-mentioned 
authorities, and in many cases an alteration in their status—and some 
idea may be formed of the difficulties to be overcome.” 
After enumerating in a summary form 18 local authorities, the same 
article continues: ‘Such is a bird’s-eye view of the whole field of 
local government. If depicted in a map, the areas form an entangled 
mass of interlacing boundaries, and when it is remembered that each 
area is a separate little kingdom with its governing body, its adminis- 
trative officers, its taxation, overlapping and conflicting with each 
other, requiring separate elections with different franchises and expen- 
sive registration, the reform of such a system would seem to require 
from its complexity the genius of a local government Moltke.”?   
‘Boroughs are of two kinds: (1) A corporate town possessing a regularly organized 
municipal government and special privileges conferred by royal charter, usually 
called a municipal borough. A town having the right to send one or more rep- 
resentatives to Parliament, usually called a parliamentary borough. (Century 
Dictionary.) 
*Nineteenth Century, March, 1888.
-P-A-G-E-162
  86 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
In 1888 a local-government act was passed dealing with the whole 
subject. It has been reenforced by subsequent laws, especially that of 
1894, but it concerns us here to note only that it made the county the 
unit of local administration, and included in that term a certain num- 
ber of boroughs, denominated county boroughs. Altogether 126 admin- 
istrative areas (65 counties, 61 county boroughs) were constituted. 
The boroughs included, practically, all the cities of England with popu- 
lations of 100,000 and upward, and a few whose populations were less 
than 100,000, the limit being 50,000. London was treated separately 
as a county. 
Intense opposition to the law of 1888 was manifested at the time by 
boroughs whose population fell below 50,000, and it was the renewal of 
opposition from this quarter that wrecked the late education bill. 
Following the precedent established in municipal boroughs, the goy- 
erning authority in the counties and county boroughs was made an 
elected council. 
These councils were brought into the category of educational authori- 
ties by legislation of 1889, authorizing them to levy a tax, not exceed- 
ing a penny in the pound, for the support of technical schools, and 
that of 1890, placing at the disposal of the councils the surplus from the 
duties on liquors, with the privilege of applying the same to technical 
education. This interest lies outside the province of elementary edu- 
cation, but it brought the councils into direct contact with the boards 
that had developed higher grade or secondary departments, and 
increased the complications between educational affairs and local 
administration. 
Since 1870 several laws have been passed dealing with elementary 
education, but none of these have departed from the principles of action 
established by the Forster law. Their purpose has been to extend and 
strengthen the operations of that law; thus the law of 1876 provided a 
machinery, viz, “‘school-attendance committees,” to enforce school 
attendance where there were no school boards.! The law of 1891, pro- 
viding for the remission of fees, was intended to increase school attend- 
ance and to prolong the average period, and such in fact has been its 
effect. The characteristic principles of the policy established in 1870, 
namely, the free expansion of local effort, the uniform and impartial 
exercise of central supervision, the prohibition of sectarian instruction 
in board or public schools, were attacked for the first time by the recent 
bill. Its proposals, tendencies, and fate will be best understood from 
speeches and articles which it evoked. These also afford an intimate, 
view of the present status of popular education in England and of those : 
complicated relations to local administration which have been indicated 
in this introductory survey. 
  
1 At the present time school boards have jurisdiction over nearly 20,000,000 of the 
population of England and Wales, leaving 10,000,000 to the oversight of school- 
attendance committees. ‘  
-P-A-G-E-163
  THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 87 
The provisions of the bill as summarized below will suffice for an 
understanding of the references in the speeches and articles cited. 
With respect to the provision as to religious instruction (clause 27 of 
the bill proper), it may be premised that the impossibility of carrying 
it in the original form was made evident from the first. The following 
is a summary of the proposed bill: 
(1) The setting up in each county and county borough of “‘a paramount educa- 
tional authority,” to be drawn mainly from the town and county councils. 5 
(2) The devolving upon this authority of the general control, right of inspection, 
and grant-dispensing powers, already possessed by the educational department. 
(3) The creation of a new “special aid grant” of 4 shillings per child in attend- 
ance at all voluntary schools and in attendance at school-board schools now receiving 
the special assistance provided under section 97 of the act of 1870 (number of ee 
board schools about 125). 
(4) The abolition of the seventeen-and-six penny limit. (See p. 104.) 
(5) The exemption of elementary schools from rating (property tax). 
(6) The provision of a public audit of accounts in all schools receiving the “spe- 
cial-aid grant.” 
(7) The granting of powers to the educational authorities to lend money to volun- 
tary schools upon the security of the school buildings. 
(8) The absolute application of the surplus from the duties on spirits to educa- 
tional purposes. 
(9) The power of veto upon any additional school-board expenditure caused by 
increases in the cost of ‘‘maintenance”’ to rest with town, county, or district coun- 
cils, as the case may be, and the fixing of a limit to the amount per capita which 
schools should be allowed to spend. 
(10) The removal of the work of carrying out the compulsory clauses of the act 
of 1870 in nonschool board districts from the hands of the present school-attendance 
committees into the hands of the new education authorities. (See footnote p. 86.) 
(11) The guardianship of industrial-school and poor-law-school children to be in 
the hands of*the new education authorities. 
(12) Opportunity for the federation of schools by districts or denominations for 
the conduct of the schools and the administration of the grant. 
(13) Permissive powers to school boards to transfer their organized science or 
higher grade schools to the care of the new educational authority. 
(14) The age for juvenile labor to be raised to 12 (present age 11 years); and 
(15) The extension of the Cowper-Temple clause of the act of 1870, so as to give 
the parent not only the right to withdraw his child from religious instruction, but 
to have facilities offered him for the teaching of his child during the hour of reli- 
gious instruction in the specific denominational tenets en his own faith. [Cited from

  88 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
THE DISABILITY UNDER WHICH THE VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS WORK. 
There is first the difficulty of voluntary schools, Last year the voluntary schools 
educated 2,445,812 children, as against 1,879,218 educated in the board schools; or, 
to put the matter in a more popular form, of every seven children educated by 
the State, three were educated in board schools and four in the voluntary schools. 
Whether or not the existence of the voluntary schools is an advantage to the State 
is a matter of controversy. I am one of those who believe that it is of advantage, 
because they tend to infuse independence, originality, and variety into our national 
education, and, to some extent, counteract that tendency to uniformity and rigid- 
ness which is the usual characteristic of a State system of education. But whatever 
view may be taken, it is not of great importance for practical statesmen, because the 
voluntary schools are there, and there seems very little prospect of their disappearing 
within any definite time. The Roman Catholics boast—and with truth—that they 
have never surrendered a single one of their schools to a board, and that those schools 
which have heen discontinued since 1870 haye been discontinued in consequence of 
the fluctuations of population. In 1870 the Church of England had 844,334 children 
in its schools; in 1895 it had 1,850,545. The subscriptions, which were in 1870 
£329,846, were in 1895 £640,496. The little comfort which some people derive from 
the reflection that, though these subscriptions have enormously increased, they have 
not increased proportionately to the number of children educated has been dispelled 
by the results of the last year, for, whereas in 1894 the subscriptions to Church of 
England schools amounted to 6s. 83d. per child, in 1895 they amounted to 6s. 104d. 
Besides this, the Church of England boast of having spent in buildings between 1870 
and 1895 a sum of £7,375,402. The Roman Catholics and a very large part of the 
members of the Church of England make it a point of conscience that their children 
should be educated by teachers of their own denomination; and it would be impos- 
sible to force those children out of their own schools into the board schools without 
being guilty of a piece of religious intolerance which the people of England in these 
enlightened days would never consent to. 
THE COST OF REPLACING THEM. 
But there is another lower, but very solid, obstacle to the disappearance of the 
voluntary schools, and that is the cost of replacing them. I have asked our profes- 
sional advisers to make some estimate of what this cost would be. Iam advised 
that there are 3,620,805 places in voluntary schools which would have to be reprovided. 
As far as the best experience goes, the cost to the country for every place provided 
in board schools is £13 8s, 8d. That includes London, where the cost is very high. 
In London the cost is £20 9s. 4d. per child; and, if you exclude London, the cost in’ 
the provinces of England and Wales is £11 5s. 10d. per child. My advisers say that 
it would be much cheaper to provide for those 3,000,000 children than it has been for 
those who have been provided for already. There would be, presumably, a number 
of voluntary schools which could be had extremely cheap, and I am advised that 
the sum of £7 per head would be a fair and not excessive estimate of the cost. At 
that rate it would cost the people of this country £25,345,635 to provide schools for 
the children now being educated in the voluntary schools. Now, how much does it 
"cost to maintain these schools? In the first place the subscriptions would have to 
be replaced by the rates, and that would cost £836,000. It is notorious that the 
expenditure in the voluntary schools is very much below that in the board schools,” 
and that difference would have to be made up out of the rates. That would amount 
to £1,373,351. Further, you would have to provide for the correspondence of the 
different schools, which is now done gratis by the managers; and it is not excessive 
to say that this administration would cost £5 a school all round, which would add 
another £72,420 to the cost. That makes altogether for the annual maintenance 
of these children a sum of £2,282,199, and that allows nothing for repairs and 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 89 
improvements. It seems to me that this capital expenditure of £25,000,000 and this 
annual expenditure of £2,225,000 is a very solid obstacle to the abolition of the volun- 
tary schools. I think, therefore, as far as practical statesmanship is concerned, that 
the question which this House has to consider is not whether it will abolish the volun- 
tary schools, but whether they are efficient for the education of the people; and, if not 
efficient, how they can be best made so. There is no doubt that some of the volun- 
tary schools are as good as any schools in the country. I have made inquiries from 
the inspectors, and the advice which they give me is this—that most of the voluntary 
schools in the poorest part of the great cities labor under financial dfficulties, and 
especially is that so with respect to the Roman Catholic schools. Those schools are 
supported some by religious orders, frequently by begging appeals, by sales of work, 
by concerts, and by subscriptions of the very poorest people. And the provision per 
head of the scholars in these schools which the managers are able to make is far 
below that which is provided in the board schools in the same great cities. They 
are further oppressed by the great rise of salaries which has taken place of recent 
years. I have before me the case of a large school at Westminster, with the same 
average attendance, where the cost of salaries has risen in six years from £605 to 
£974. Ihave the case of another school at Salford in which, in the same six years 
and with the same average attendance, the salaries have risen from £981 to £1,282. 
THE ‘‘INTOLERABLE STRAIN” AND WHO BEARS IT. 
If you take a survey of the whole country you will find that the sum devoted to 
the maintenance of children in voluntary schools amounts to £1 18s. 11}4. per child, 
as against £2 10s. 12d. per child in the board schools. That makes a difference of 
11s. 24d. per child. And this difference is almost entirely represented by a lower 
payment to the teaching staff, for the difference in the cost of the teaching staff in 
the voluntary schools and the board schools is 9s. 44d. per child. This difference, 
which is so great over the whole extent of the Kingdom, is greater still in the great 
cities. In London the difference is no less than 19s. 93d., in Liverpool 13s. 7d., in 
Manchester 11s. 7d., and in Leeds 12s.1%d. The result of this difference in the teach- 
ing staff in the schools is this: In the first place all teachers in voluntary schools are 
lower paid than the corresponding teachers in the board schools. Take them man 
for man and with the same number of children, and you will find all round that 
the head teachers in the voluntary schools are far lower paid than the head teachers 
in the board schools. Then for assistant teachers they have cheaper and less-qualified 
teachers. As everyone knows, a concession was made several years ago which 
allowed schools to have a young woman of upward of 18, and approved by the 
inspector, without any specific qualification at all, as an assistant in schools, and 
that kind of assistant has increased with most marvelous and extraordinary rapidity. 
There is also this very year a concession made*in the Code allowing the head teacher 
in small country schools to be a person possessed of less qualifications. It is a very 
bad arrangement, in my opinion. My poverty, and not my will, consented to it. And 
then the voluntary schools have to use to a very great extent that most extravagant 
form of economy, child labor. Besides having less-qualified teachers, voluntary 
schools are, as compared with board schools, understaffed, that is to say, they have 
fewer teachers to the same number of children. They only just comply with the 
minimum recommendations of the committee of council. I have said enough to 
show the House that the question really is, How is the teaching staff in voluntary 
schools to be improved, and what arethe means which we should resort to for that 
purpose? 
BUT BOARD SCHOOLS BEAR A STRAIN ALSO. 
But it is not the voluntary schools only that are oppressed by the great weight of 
their duties. There are necessitous board schools as well. This was foreseen at the 
time when the act of 1870-was passed. There is a section of that aet—section 9T—
-P-A-G-E-166
  90 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
which provides that if a school board can not, by levying a 3-penny rate, provide a 
sum of 7s. 6d. per child for the children that it has to educate, then the State will 
make a contribution from the exchequer to make up the difference. It was supposed 
at that time that that was a sufficient and adequate provision. Experience has 
proyed that it is wholly inadequate. There is near London the school district of 
Walthamstow, where the school board has been established for the last fifteen years, 
and where the rates during that period have risen from 4d. to 1s. 6d. in the pound. 
It has a population of tradesmen and artisans which has doubled in ten years and 
which is now 61,000. There are 31 schools, and £20,000 a year is being spent on their 
maintenance. There are new schools now being built, and further schools are 
urgently required. There are no factories or valuable rating property on which the 
‘school board can operate, and a 1-penny rate only raises £800. Under section 97 the 
grant which this district obtains is only £956. That is not a solitary instance. 
Thero is West Ham, where in 1895-96 the school rate is 2s. 4d. in the pound. There 
is the case of Ormesby, near Middlesbrough, where for the last three years the rate 
has ayeraged Is. 54d.; and there is the case of the Forest of Dean, where the rate is 
2s. 5d. in the pound. In rural districts also there are many school boards established 
in small parishes where the rate which has to be levied for the purpose of maintain- 
ing the school is of enormous amount. 
THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF RURAL EDUCATION. 
That brings me to say a few words to the House on the whole subject of rural edu- 
eation. On education in the rural districts there are two diametrically opposite 
opinions. There are some people who say—though they say it more in private than 
in public—that education is thrown away on boys who are destined to spend their 
youth in scaring crows, their manhood in field labor, and their old age in the work- 
house. There are other people who say that knowledge and intelligence are among 
the commodities most needed in the country districts, and that if all classes engaged 
in the cultivating of the soil, from the top to the bottom, were better informed we 
should grow more of the food of the people at home and import less. But, which- 
ever opinion may be correct, there is nothing to be said in favor of halting between 
them as we do. Wespend subscriptions, rates, and time in the education of the rural 
population, but we do not carry the operation far enough to raise up an instructed 
peasantry like that which in Normandy or in Demark is capable of receiving tech- 
nical education and able to undersell us with its produce. There is no official infor- 
mation as to the results, but such glimpses of rural education as we get are extremely 
discouraging. An honorable member a week or two ago called my attention to the 
amount of illiteracy in the voting for Parliament, and he seemed to be surprised 
that there were large numbers of the rural voters who could not read or write. 
There is in Ipswich a labor bureau, which has been carried on for some years under 
the management of Mr. Wyckham Tozer. Some years ago, finding that a large num: 
ber of applications came from youths in the country districts around Ipswich, Mr. 
Tozer formed the idea of making a little educational investigation. He had a form 
which he required applicants to fill up in their own handwriting, giving their age, 
place of birth, school attended, and standard reached. On the back was set a little 
arithmetical examination—an addition of simple money, a multiplication of asum of 
money by 8, and a problem such as, “If 10 pounds of flour cost so much, what would 
be the cost of 2 hundredweight.” The result of this investigation was that, of the 
boys between 16 and 18 years of age who applied for employment, one-fourth could 
write fairly, one-quarter could write moderattly, and quite one-half could only writo 
in the most disgraceful manner, both as to penmanship and spelling. As to the arith- 
metic, 10 per cent answered the questions, 15 per cent were able to do one of the sums 
set, and 75. per cent could not answer a single one of the questions. And yet many 
of these boys had a few years before been in village schools, and some of them had 
attained as high as the sixth standard.  
-P-A-G-E-167
  THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. ei 
THE PETTIFOGGING RURAL SCHOOL BOARD. 
As things are, the only salvation of rural education, such as it is,is the parson’s 
. Village school. He has many advantages as the manager of a school. He is an edu- 
cated man, and knows something of the necessities of education. Ido not say that 
all school boards in the country are ill-managed. There are some which are not 
generally, because the clergyman of the parish, or the minister of some other denomi- 
nation, or some gentleman interested in education, takes up the school board and 
manages it. But,as a general rule, while the board schools in the great cities have 
proved themselves extremely efficient in education, the board schools in the country 
have proved themselves totally inefficient. If you were to replace the voluntary 
schools in the country by board schools you would degrade national education, I 
think this is proved very often by the efforts which the people themselves make in the 
country districts to avert what they regard as the calamity of school boards, There 
are numberless places, both country parishes and small towns, in which for years past 
a voluntary rate has been levied and a committee of the inhabitants have been 
appointed who have applied this voluntary rate to subsidize the church and dis- 
senting schools, and have in. this way kept off what they considered to be the 
calamity of a school board. The records of the education office are full of examples 
of the absurdities and incapacities of country school boards. The House will remem- 
ber that not many weeks ago I was questioned by the honorable member for Cock- 
ermouth, who called attention to the fact that a school board was educating its 
infants in a room in the “New Buck Inn.” In the educational report for 1894-95 
there is a quotation from Mr. Wilson, an inspector in the eastern division of England, 
who says that the school attendance is far from satisfactory, and that some of the 
smaller boards do not even pretend to enforce the law. Indeed, they can not, as it is 
part of their election pledges not to prosecute for irregular attendance. The fol- 
lowing passage, however, in the general report for 1894, drawn up by Mr. Brodie, 
till recently Her Majesty’s chief inspector for the southwestern division of England, 
and published in the report of the education department for 1895, contains the most 
outspoken criticism of the proceedings of somo small country boards: 
“The climax is reached inthe country board school. True, indeed, it is that a few 
of these are well managed, but in by far the most there is no management at all 
worthy of the name; there is no pride in progress—nay, the very reverse. Additional 
subjects mean additional staff, additional apparatus; the rates must be kept down, 
the school starved, the teacher underpaid, and sometimes, if the inspector does not 
sternly forbid it, some young, raw, untrained, and even stupid relative of one of the 
members of the school board is to be foisted onto the teaching staff, to produce such 
rotten fruit as may be expected when a sickly graft is added to an already unhealthy 
tree. Isubjoin two facts which have come tomy knowledge. In one country board 
school, which, by the great vigor and ability of the master, aided by a clever wife, 
had obtained great success, the master was rewarded by having his salary cut down 
by £20. Why? I answer (not without indignation), because he had earned that 
amount by his able conduct of the night school. In another country board school 
an active and zealous young mistress was dismissed because she wished to teach 
geography and was otherwise ardent for progress. She was replaced by a middle- 
aged and worn-out woman, who at no time could have had much capacity for teach- 
ing, and who could neither keep order nor get the children on. Thus do the ‘rude 
forefathers of the hamlet’ nip the budding intellect of ingenuous youth. What a 
penny wise, pound foolish system!” 
THE CONDITION OF THE RURAL TEACHER. 
Then I should like the Houso to note the condition of the rural teachers. What 
arrangement have we in country places for the supply of rural teachers? Our pupil 
eachers area sortof child drudge. He or she walks to school, often at some distance; 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
92 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
lessons are taken either before school, in the dinner hour when the children are 
playing, or after school when the others have gone home; they are teaching all day 
long in the school, and they have to walk home when the work is over. This is not 
the way to bring up teachers. If any one would contrast the treatment of our coun- 
try teachers with the treatment of teachers in France or Germany, I think they will 
not be surprised that the general level of country education in France and Germany 
is greatly superior to our own. There are no centers for teaching pupil teachers as 
in great towns, and the consequence is that when the Queen’s scholarship examina- 
tion comes on the places are filled by town-bred pupil teachers, and only one or two 
country-bred teachers are squcezed in at the bottom of the list. Heads of training 
colleges will tell you that such country teachers as do squeeze in steadily rise in 
their ability and training, showing that their deficiencies are not in natural capacity, 
put only in the way in which they have been trained. I hope that I have said enough 
to convince the House that there is some valuable work before them in reference to 
elementary education. 
Tne PROBLEM oF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
THE VARIETY OF CENTRAL AUTHORITIES. 
  Now I will say a few words upon secondary education. It is not a question 
whether we should now proceed to interfere with secondary education. We are 
interfering with secondary education—have been interfering with it for years; but 
the question is whether we interfere in a foolish or in a wise manner. At the 
presenttime secondary education is being supervised by ten:separate authorities, 
four central and six local. The central authorities are, first, the charity commis- 
sioners, who frame schemes for the use of educational endowments, and who 
generally supervise the administration of those educational endowments in par- 
ticular places, not doing this entirely by themselves, but consulting, to some 
extent, the education department; secondly, there is a science and art depart- 
ment, which makes grants of public money to schools and classes, thereby exercis- 
ing a most powerful influence on the secondary education of the country. They 
lay down the conditions on which they give their grants: First, schools must 
be either under the local authority or school board, under the governing body of 
endowed schools, or a local committee which is appointed, and under whose approval 
encouragement is given to make organized science schools, that is to say, to havea 
curriculum which is to be pursued for three years in accordance with plans pre- 
scribed by the science and art department. They pay grants according to results, 
and in that way they have exercised a notable influence on secondary education. 
Among other things, they have greatly depressed the literary side of education, and, 
though that is now modified, the payment is half by results and half by attendance. 
The result indicated, however, has been produced, and it will take many years to 
undo it. Then there is the education department, which influences the secondary 
education, first of all, through its higher grade schools, which supply many great 
cities with excellent secondary education, and often the only secondary education 
attainable. Then there are evening schools, which, again, supply secondary edu- 
cation; and, finally, there are the training colleges, which, though confined to a 
particular class, namely, those who are country teachers, are secondary schools in 
every sense of the word; and the last central authority is the board of agriculture. 
The board of agriculture may inspect and report on any school in which technical 
instruction on any subject connected with agriculture is given. The subjects include 
chemistry, physics, biology, geology, mensuration, surveying, leveling, and book- 
keeping, and schools may be aided out of a parliamentary grant. 
THE GREATER VARIETY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES. 
Now I come to the local authorities. The first and most important local authority 
is the county council. The county council, under the technical instruction acts of
-P-A-G-E-169
’ 
THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 93 
1889-1891, may impose a penny rate for the purpose of giving aid to technical instruc- 
tion, and they have also the power to apply to technical instruction the residue of 
the local taxation money under the act of 1890, after reserves have been made for 
police and valuation. I have been inquiring how many counties in England and 
Wales apply this local taxation grant money of 1890 to the purpose of education. I 
find that in Wales the whole of the Welsh counties, including Monmouth and the 
three county boroughs in Wales, all apply the whole of their money to education. 
In England, out of 49 counties, 41 apply the whole of their money to education and 
8 apply a portion of it. Out of 61 county boroughs in England 55 devote the whole 
and 5 a part, and 1 only applies the whole of the money in relief of these rates. 
Besides that, there are 11 county boroughs, 51 other boroughs, and 86 urban districts 
which impose rates under the powers of the technical-instruction act for the purposes 
of education; and one county (Wilts) has made a rate on a small area round Calne 
for the erection of an institute inthe town. For the building purposes of education 
the counties have spent £339,135, and the county boroughs have sunk £662,836. 
Altogether, of all the moneys which were received under the local-taxation (1890) 
act, the whole of it is applied to education with the exception of £151,643, of which 
£115,758 is in London, so that only £35,885 is reserved in the towns and counties 
of England and Wales for that purpose. Then come the local governing bodies, 
such as the governing bodies of endowed schools, the managing committees of pro- 
prietary schools and institutes, the local committees of the science and art depart- 
ment, school boards giving secondary education, and managers of yoluntary schools, 
who also in many places give secondary education. In the appendix to the report 
of the Secondary Education Commission the House will find a very interesting table 
which shows what each county authority and county borough receives in the shape 
of endowment for science and art grants, local taxation grants, and rates applied 
for the purpose of education. It appears from it that there was actually spent in 
1894 in England and Wales for secondary education by these various authorities 
£1,424,404, and if those authorities were to exercise all the powers which they pos- 
sess under the various acts then there would be at the disposal of secondary educa- 
tion £2,381,184. Many public secondary schools draw their income from a number 
of different sources. It is drawn from their fees, endowments, science and art 
grants, county council grants, the education department, the board of agriculture, 
and the school board. They are inspected and examined by a variety of those dif- 
ferent authorities. There is a piece of evidence from one of the witnesses before the 
Royal Commission on Secondary Education which I should like to read. It is from 
Mr. Easterbrook, headmaster of Owen’s school, Islington, a member of the Head- 
masters’ Association. He says: 
“The multiplicity of examinations is such a pressing evil that we really feel that 
there should be some relief offered us. I will give you a list of the examinations 
which one particular school has to keep its eye on during the year—the drawing 
examination of the science and art department in April, the science examination 
in May, the matriculation of the London University in January and June, the Lon- 
don county council intermediate scholarships in June. That is the case of London. 
Then there is the intermediate science and art examination in July, the Lon- 
don Chamber of Commerce examination in July. Then comes the annual examina- 
tion required by the charity commissioners’ scheme, the Cambridge local examination 
in December, and during the year, at different times, civil service examinations, 
professional examinations, and open scholarships at the universities. I am not 
overstating it in any case. I am giving the case of a particular school.” 
Itis not surprising after what I have said that the secondary education commis- 
sioners report upon this subject in the following terms. This is the justification of 
the Government for bringing in the measure which they are going to ask the House 
to adopt. The commissioners, speaking of the want of coherence and correlation of 
secondary education, viz: 
“Of the loss now incurred through the want of such coherence and correlation it
-P-A-G-E-170
  
  94 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
isimpossible to speak too strongly. * * * Unfortunately, so far from tending to 
eure itself, it is an evil which every day strikes its roots deeper. The existing 
authorities and agencies, whose want of cooperation we lament, are each of them 
getting more accustomed to the exercise of their present powers and less disposed 
to surrender them. Vested interests are being created which will stand in the way 
-of the needed reforms. Thus, the difficulty of introducing the needful coherence 
and correlation becomes constantly greater, and will be more serious a year or two 
hence than it is at the present moment. We feel bound, therefore, to state the 
opinion, which has grown stronger in us since we entered upon this inquiry, that 
the matter is one of urgency and ought to engage the very early attention of Your 
Majesty’s advisers and of Parliament.” v2 
THE WORK OF THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT. 
I have now come to my last point, and that is the education department itself. 
As long ago as 1859 the present Bishop of London and Lord Lingen, before the 
Duke of Newcastle’s commission, declared that the complication in the education 
office was enormous, owing to the central system. In 1883, Mr. Patrick Cumming, 
so long the secretary of the education department, said that the tremendous detail 
of looking into every school of the country was too cumbrous. It was all very well 
when education was. a small affair, but now that it has become national, it seemed 
to him that the system was too detailed. Last year the education department 
inspected 19,789 day schools and 3,421 evening schools. From each of these schools 
they received two direct communications, one from the managers and one from the 
inspector. As eachpair of these documents contains 1,659 blank spaces which have 
to be filled up, it follows that the department had last year to deal with 52,829,951 
blank spaces. Of course, as the claim of the schools depends upon the accurate 
scrutiny of these blank spaces, it follows that they have to be carefully looked at, 
and each document has to go through fifty-four different stages. Besides this, there 
are 32,476 pupil-teachers under the immediate supervision of the department, and ~ 
. each of them has a separate report upon him or her examined in the office. I donot 
think that the House has any idea where the education department is. They fancy 
‘that it is in Whitehall, but in Whitehall there are only the secretarial staff and cer- 
tain heads of departments whose presence is indispensable. A great part of the 
department is in Cannon buildings, King street; another part is in the old Census 
Office; another is in Northumberland avenue, while the whole staff of the education 
library and of the new directors of special inquiries is now wandering about looking 
for some home. 
THE PROPOSALS OF THE GOVERNMENT. 
THE NEW COUNTY AND BOROUGH AUTHORITY. 
Having tried to give the House some idea of the existing state of things, I now 
come to the bill itself. The principle of the measure is the establishment in every 
county and county borough of a paramount education authority. It is to be one 
channel through which public money is to reach the schools; it is to supplement and 
not to supersede existing educational effort, and it is to be a sort of separate educa- 
tional department for each county and for each county borough. The proposal is 
not novel. It was recommended by the Duke of Newcastle’s committee in 1861, as 
regards elementary education; by the school-inquiry commission of 1868, as regards. 
secondary education; by the technical-instruction commission of 1884, as regards 
technical and secondary education; in a memorandum issued by Lord Cross’s com- 
mission in 1888; and finally by the secondary-education commission which has just 
reported. Itis proposed in the bill that the education authority shall be the county 
council acting through astatutory educational committee, and it is proposed to leave 
the number and composition of this committee entirely in the discretion of the county 
council. There are some admirable suggestions in the report of the secondary- 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 95 
education commission as to the constitution of these bodies. These suggestions ~ 
relate to the question of the presence of women on these committees, to the question 
of the election of experts and of teachers’ representatives, etc. The only restric- 
tion that will be placed on the composition of a committee is that a majority of its 
members must be members of the county council. Power is given to counties to 
combine for the purposes of the bill. In counties where the circumstances are special, 
as in the county of London, the county council may itself propose a scheme for the 
special constitution of 2 committee which, when approved by the education depart- 
ment, will become the committee for the county ; and in the case of Wales the govern- 
ing bodies under the Welsh intermediate-education act will become the committees. 
It is proposed to decentralize entirely the administration of school grants by the 
education department, and to throw upon these bodies the duties of administering 
the parliamentary grant. The general inspection of schools will, of course, be under- 
taken also. by the county authority, and the committee of council, the central goy- 
ernment, will only have inspectors who will visit the schools from time to time to 
see that the county education authority is properly fulfilling its duties and that the 
education is up to the proper standard. It is hoped that this arrangement will lead 
to a decentralization of the Code, and that instead of our attempting to impose one 
rigid system of education from the Land’s End to Berwick-upon-Tweed, each county 
and county borough shall be able to make such modifications in the Code as may be 
suitable to its particular local circumstances. Then itis proposed to hand over to 
this committee the powers of the county council under the technical-instruction act, 
1889. The money received under the local-taxation act, 1890, will be specially appli- 
cable to secondary education and will be administered by the education authority and 
may be accumulated. This authority will also be the school-attendance committee 
in all places which have not a school board. Lastly, this authority will constitute 
a body to which may be intrusted hereafter those unhappy children of the State who 
are to be found in industrial and poor-law schools, and this body may deliver them 
from the prison taint on the one hand and the workhoutise taint on the other. This 
authority will exercise all the powers given to the county council with regard to. 
industrial and reformatory schools, and may make contracts with boards of guardians 
to take charge of poor-law children, so that they may be brought up in a humane 
fashion and may have a chance of becoming honest, self-supporting men. 
THE NEW ‘‘SPECIAL-AID GRANT,” “TO BE APPROPRIATED, IN THE FIRST PLACE, TO 
THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE TEACHING STAFF.” 
Then this authority is to distribute a special-aid grant to necessitous schools. 
The committee will receive from the exchequer a sum of 4s, for every child in 
voluntary schools or in the schools of those school boards which come under section 
97 of the act of 1870.. This special-aid grant will be divided among the voluntary 
schools, with a deduction for any endowments which they may possess, and, as 
regards the board schools, it will, in the first place, be used for making good any 
grants which they are entitled to, and the residue will be used for the general 
assistance of board schools which stand in need of further help from public sources. 
But in both cases the amounts received are appropriated, in the first place, to the 
improvement of the teaching staff, and it is only in cases where the teaching staff 
does not require improying that the sums may be applied to other definite purposes 
which are specified in the bill, There is a power given to schools to federate them- 
selves either by districts or denominations, and in case a federation of schools is 
formed the education authority of the county may pay over the whole grant to 
which the group of schools is entitled in a lump sum, leaving it to be distributed 
according to a scheme to be approved by the education department. Any surplus 
left in their hands will be applied to local purposes of elementary education as the 
education department may sanction. 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
PUBLIC AUDIT OF ACCOUNTS. 
  Thero are also provisions for examination and inspection, and for the auditing of 
accounts by district auditors in order to insure that the money is applied to the pur- 
poses for which it is given. In case the voluntary schools in any district which has 
not at present a school board break down and other provision for education becomes 
necessary, in a county borough the education authority becomes the school board. 
In any other district, parish, urban district, or noncounty borough the district is to 
have the option of having a school board as at present. There is no compulsion, 
with the exception that if it isa borough the school board is not to be an elected 
school board; but there is to be a committee of the municipal council formed on the 
analogy of the education department. If the district does not choose to have a school 
board, then the educational authority of the county becomes the school board for the 
parish, district, or borough, and after an opportunity has been given for establish- 
ing a school board they may take over the elementary schools of any district and 
become in that way virtually the school board for the district. Then in the case of 
a defaulting school board, if a school board becomes a defaulter, the education 
authority becomes the school board for the district; but in performing their duties 
as a school board in reference to the control and management of schools they must 
delegate their authority to manage to local managers. They are not directly to man- 
age schools themselves. In the case of county boroughs the local managers are to 
be appointed by the education authority themselves, and in the case of other boroughs 
by the municipal council; and in the case of parishes, half by the parish and half 
by the education authority. Then these schools are to be paid for either by arate 
upon the district or by a county rate charged on all those districts for which the 
education authority acts as a school board. This will tend to—and I hope it will 
grow into—a system under which all those parts of the county in which there are 
public schools will all be connected with and under the authority of the county 
education authority, and will be maintained out of the general county rate. As 
regards secondary education, the new authority will be able to aid schools out of 
the money at their disposal, to aid schools for secondary education, and to estab- 
lish them; and with the consent of the education department they may take a trans- 
fer from the school boards of their higher grade schools and so become managers of 
higher grade schools. Then they may apply their money to scholarships and the 
supply of teachers. They may inquire into the sanitary condition of all schools, 
and they may also inquire into the education given in all schools except those which 
are decided to be nonlocal. In the case of local schools they may publish any 
information they may think proper as to the efficiency of those schools. 
THE ‘SEVENTEEN AND SIXPENNY Limit.” 
EXEMPTION FROM RATING—TWELVE YEARS OF AGE FOR JUVENILE LABOR—VETOING 
SCHOOL BOARD EXPENDITURES, 
Besides all this, the bill contains also a number of miscellaneous amendments of 
the education acts, which I will very shortly enumerate. There is the abolition 
of the 17s. 6d. limit. There is a clause exempting elementary schools from all rates. 
Then I am happy to say that the age of school attendance is raised to 12 years. 
There is no attempt to deal with the question of half time, and the clause is one similar 
to that passed by the right honorable gentleman, the late vice-president of the coun- 
cil, two years ago, except that the age of 11 is turned into 12. Then powers are given 
to the county authorities to lend money, to the managers of voluntary schools on the 
security of the school buildings; and there are limits put to the school-board rate, 
requiring any increase in the rate in consequence of the maintenance of children to 
be sanctioned by the public authority before it is levied. 
Mr. ACLAND. What is the authority? ’
-P-A-G-E-173
  THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. SE 
Sir J. Gorst. If the district is a borough, it must be the council of the borough; 
if it is an urban district, it must be the district council, and in any other case the 
county council of the county in which the district is situated. Finally, the Govern- 
ment have put a clause in the bill in the hope of laying the very last objection which 
could be made to elementary education on religious grounds. 
THE EXTENSION OF THE COWPER-TEMPLE CLAUSE. 
I did not enumerate the religious difficulty as one of the difficulties which had to 
be surmounted by Parliament, because the religious difficulty is no difficulty at all 
in the schools. It is never heard of there. It is a difficulty which flourishes in Par- 
liament and on the platform. Since I have held the office I now have the honor to 
hold I have asked in many schools whether there was any religious difficulty, and I 
have never yet found that there was any. I have never found a school-teacher to 
tell me at first hand that they have ever had any difficulty with the parents, children, 
or anyone else on the teaching of religion to the children. This clause is a kind of 
supplement to the conscience clause. It not only enables a parent to withdraw his 
child from religious instruction of which he does not approve, but it also helps him 
to secure that religious instruction which ho requires. The provision is that in every 
elementary school one of the conditions of receiving a Government grant is that if a 
reasonable number of parents of children require to have separate religious instruc- 
tion given to them, then it is the duty of the managers of the school to permit of 
reasonable arrangements being made for allowing that religious instruction to be 
given. It is hoped that in that way if there are any parents who conscientiously 
.desire that their children should be instructed separately from the other children in 
the schools it is the duty of the managers of the schools to give every possible 
facility for the teaching of that form of religion which they require. I do hope that 
this may be accepted by the’ House of Commons as a sincere attempt on the part of the 
Government to introduce a system of perfect religious toleration. Iam very much 
obliged to the House for allowing me to make this very long statement, and I hope. 
the bill will be approached by the House of Commons in a really businesslike spirit. 
I can not, of course, expect that every clause will be generally accepted on both sides 
of the House, but I hope that the principle of the bill will be, and that we shall alk 
cooperate together to make this a real step in advance in the education of the 
country. (Schoolmaster, April 4, 1896, pages 617-619.) 
The keenest analysis of the bill made in the House on the side of the 
opposition was by Mr. Asquith! in his speech on the resolution for the 
second reading. At the outset he noted the provisions which, even 
from his standpoint, were recognized as valuable and beneficent. 
These were, first, the proposition to raise the age for compulsory at- 
tendance from 11 to 12, and, second, the proposals as to secondary 
education. He then proceeded with the objectionable features, con- 
sidering chiefly the question of local authority. Under this head Mr. 
Asquith said: 
* * * Now, I will ask the House to come to close quarters with the actual pro- 
visions of the measure. As the right honorable gentleman has told us, the pivot upon 
which the whole of this scheme hinges and turns is the creation in every county and. 
in every county borough in England and Wales of a new education authority which 
is at once to discharge some, and which in the course of time is intended to perform 
all, the functions as to inspection, as to examination, as to control, and as to pay- 
ment which are at present vested in the education department. The decentralization 
of the control of education was represented by the right honorable gentleman, and. 
  
1 Secretary of state home department in Mr. Gladstone’s fourth ministry. 
ED 96——4    
-P-A-G-E-174
  98 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
I think properly represented, as being the very foundation and the mainspring of 
thescheme. When the bill comes into full operation—although I understand from the 
speech which we have just heard in its initial stages its provisions are to be tem- 
pered by a very invidious process of selection—you will have in England and Wales 
no less than 126 education departments. This is the number of the counties and of 
the county boroughs. In the county of Lancaster alone you will have no less than 
15 education departments. | 
I am quite aware that there are provisions in the bill which enable these authori- 
ties by agreement to combine with one another. ButI donot think that anyone who 
is acquainted with the facts of our local life and adequately appreciates the tenacity | 
and exclusiveness of what I may call our municipal patriotism, its rivalries and jeal- | 
ousics, which are often founded, I agree, upon real diversities of local sentimentand 
of local interest—I do not believe that anybody who is acquainted with the facts will 
believe that that power is likely to be very frequently resorted to. Many of these 
new departments—I will not say all of them--will have or may have educational 
codes of theirown. The right honorable gentleman has told us that the education 
department will scrutinize with jealousy any proposals of the kind thatmay be made, 
but, as I shall point out presently, the education department, when you have regard 
to the terms and spirit of the bill, will do so with maimed powers and with fettered 
hands. It is true that the education department in name and in theory remains, but 
it remains in the background, a spectral and disembodied authority—an authority 
of which you might say with truth that it reigns, but it can not govern; for the very 
essence of your scheme is, in the future, as regards the discharge of these very func- 
tions which now for more than a generation have been exercised by the education, 
department upon uniform principles over the country as a whole, to make local opin- 
ion and local feeling predominant and supreme. 
This ingenious plan for the production of what I can not help thinking will be an 
educational patchwork and an administrative chaos is presented to us under the 
specious name of decentralization. Those of us, of whom I certainly am one, who 
are strongly in favor of the principle of devolution, who wish to see transferred 
to local bodies a very large number of the powers and prerogatives which are at 
present exercised both at Westminster and at Whitehall, are challenged to'reconcile 
our faith in that principle with our opposition to this measure. I never hada chal- 
lenge which I could contemplate with more equanimity or take up with greater 
confidence. What is the essence of devolution in any intelligible and rational 
sense of the term? Devolution means the taking away from the central authority 
of powers which experience has shown that that authority exercises ignorantly or 
inefficiently, and it means the granting to local authorities, competent by their com- 
position to discharge the task, and with time and energy to spare for it, of powers 
which can be more fitly and more properly exercised by them. I do not stand here 
this evening in any sense as an uncompromising or uncritical advocate of the educa- 
tion department. Ihave no doubt, as the right honorable gentleman told us when 
he introduced this bill, there is, under the existing system, an excess of routine, and 
even of red tape, a multiplication of gratuitous forms, an accumulation of unneces- 
sary details. I will go further, and I agree that in our large urban communities— 
in places like London itself; like Birmingham, like Leeds, and like many other 
towns—there is in existence what I may call an indigenous enthusiasm for education 
so keen and so well organized that it stands in very little need of extraneous super- 
vision and control, and that it might very well be trusted with a wider latitude of 
action and a larger freedom of making experiments. 
But the House can not fallinto a greater or more fatal delusion than to measure 
the educational climate of the country as a whole by the temperature of these great 
towns. I certainly am not exaggerating—and I should have thought I was here 
upon what the right honorable gentleman calls common ground—when I say that 
over large parts of England at any rate there is not—we may regret it, we may 
acquiesce in it, but we are bound to admit it—there is not that local interest in  
-P-A-G-E-175

. ‘ 
[THe ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. Sou 
educational progress which, if matters of this kind are to be left entirely to local 
initiative, is the only security for the maintenance of a high standard of education, 
Ido not think the right honorable gentleman himself, with his knowledge of the 
work of his department, will question the truth of that statement. I do,not hesi- 
tate to say that if throughout the length and breadth of England and Wales during 
the last thirty years we have succeeded in constantly raising what I may call the 
minimum standard of educational efficiency, the main credit for the accomplishment 
of that most beneficent work is to be put down to the impartial, unsleeping, and the 
ubiquitous activity of the education department. 
You are proposing by this bill to transfer the work of examination and of inspec- 
tion from that department, in the first instance, at any rate, to the local authorities. 
Now, may I give the House an illustration drawn from another branch of admin- 
istration with which I happened myself to be personally familiar—I mean the fac- 
tory department of the home office? That is a highly centralized system of admin- 
istration, and there are many people who think—I confess I myself used to think— 
that it might very well, in some of its parts, at any rate, be delegated to local 
authorities. In the year 1891 Parliament did transfer the inspection of workshops, 
so far as their sanitation was concerned, from the home office to the local authorities. 
When I went to the home office and during the time I was there, I found that that 
part of their duties—though of course there were exceptions again in the case of 
large towns—was being systematically neglected over all parts of the country. I 
do not hesitate to say—and I speak from a certain amount of practical acquaintance 
with the matter—that if you were to do with reference to factory inspection that 
which it is proposed by this bill to do in reference to school inspection, there are 
many parts of England in which, after the expiration of five years, these laws which 
were passed for the protection of the lives and limbs of our working population 
would be a dead letter. If that is the case in relation to such a matter as factories, 
it is still more likely to be the case in relation to schools; for remember that, as 
regards schools, the work of inspection does not merely mean that you are to see 
that the law is being complied with, but upon that work depends the grant and the 
receipt of large sums of public money which are not locally raised but voted by 
Parliament. I am satisfied—and I speak in no partisan spirit, but merely in the 
interests of good administration, so far as this subject is concerned—that it is the 
presence, or at any rate the liability of tho presence, of an inspector who is totally 
detached from local prepossessions and local influences, who speaks with the authority 
of a great department and even of Parliament itself, who is not sypject to appoint- 
ment or dismissal, to raise of salary or promotion in rank according as he makes 
himself agreeable or disagreeable to the locality concerned—it is the presence of a 
body of impartial, detached, dispassionate officials of that kind which, both as regards 
the inspection of schools and of factories, is the most effective security for the uni- 
form observance of the law, 
Isay I speak in this matter as a strong disciple and advocate of tho principle of 
devolution. Localize management as much as you like. I will go with the right 
honorable gentleman any length in that direction. If he were doing what from his 
speech we should have inferred he was going to do—to give the management of 
schools, the appointment and dismissal of the teachers, the everyday control of the 
education of the place to a representative popular authority—we should be with 
him toaman. But thatis just what he is not going to do. As regards these all- 
important questions, the great bulk of the schools, nearly 15,000 out of the 20,000, are 
to remain as they are at present, in irresponsible hands. The thing which you are 
going to devolve upon the local authority is the very thing which local authorities, 
so far as our administrative experience in the past goes, are least fitted to perform. 
Who are these local authorities? They are committees nominated by the county 
councils and by the town councils of the county boroughs. Do these authorities 
wish for the task which you are going to intrust to them? Have any of them asked 
for it? I know some that have not, and not only not asked for it, but have already
-P-A-G-E-176

  100 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
evidenced the greatest disinclination to undertake these alien and incongruous ‘ 
duties. Have they time for it? So far as I know, the great bulk of the work of 
these bodies is done, not at the meetings of the council, but in numerous committees 
constantly sitting, and whose time and energy are at present amply occupied by the 
discharge of the oncrous and delicate duties cast upon them, Further, are the rate- 
payers of the counties—the very persons who are in such distress, according to the 
Government, that large subventions are at this moment being made to them out of 
the imperial exchequer—prepared to undertake the additional pecuniary burdens 
which this scheme casts upon them? 
Quite independently of the agreement which may ultimately be come to between 
the education department and the local authorities for the purposes of the distribu- 
tion of the special aid grant, which is a function they can not cast off, they will be 
obliged to equip themselves with offices, a staff of inspectors and examiners capable 
of seeing that the schools between which this grant is to be allocated are in a fit 
condition to receive it, and to determine the exact degree of efficiency they possess. 
That means an enormous addition to the permanent administrative cost of every 
county and county borough in England and Wales. If you are going to get any 
adequate result from it, if you can show that it is likely in any proportionate degree 
to raise the standard of education, I would not oppose it; but you are going to 
duplicate inspection. You are going to keep inspectors at Whitehall, while in every 
county there has to be provided at the expense of the local ratepayers a second set 
of inspectors, who are to perform the same functions which are performed by the 
others. Let the House consider how this scheme will work out in ono large county, 
where the population is scattered; where the means of communication are imper- 
fect; where, even for the ordinary purposes of the county council, the work of 
administration at present is burdensome to the last degree. 
You will need in a county like Devonshire, Dorset, or Wiltshire, in permanent 
session, at some place or other—or, I suppose, constantly perambulating about it— 
this county committee; and if, as will be the case, as experience shows—no body of 
men, however zealous, and however public-spirited, can keep abreast of the routine 
work which is to be taken away from the education department—you will throw 
more and more in all those counties the actual daily control of the work of inspee- 
tion and examination, not on the committee, but on the permanent staff of officials 
supported in equipment and character by those engaged at present in performing 
the work. But the right honorable gentleman tells us that tho education depart- 
ment will still remain; the work is to be done locally, but the education department 
will set things right. I can hardly imagine a system more calculated to engender 
unnecessary friction than this proposal of the bill. Suppose that the inspectors 
of the department differ from the local inspectors as to the efficiency of a particular 
set of schools, a school, or the whole of the schools of a county. Who is to decide? 
The right honorable gentleman says the education department; but the local author- 
ity will have a tremendous weapon in its hands when it is able to point out that Par- 
liament, after fifty years’ experience, has come to the conclusion that, prima facie, 
local opinion ought in these matters to prevail; and the education department in 
this House, or elsewhere, will find that it is a very different position—a position 
of impaired and discredited authority, for the purpose of making its voice heard and 
decision predominant—as compared with what itis to-day. * * * 
What is going to be the effect of the bill on the school boards? The right honor- 
able gentleman in his speech said, in language which seemed to be very carefully 
chosen, that no attack was made “directly.” I must ask the House to examine this 
matter a little in detail. We ought, perhaps, I admit, to have been better prepared 
than we were for the animosity—I can use no other word—displayed in this bill to 
the school-board system. Lord Salisbury’s hostility to that system has been long 
known, and to do him justice, has never been concealed, and has frequently been 
expressed. In this view, apparently, the school-board system does at once too 
much and too little. On the one hand it wastes the ratepayers’ money in cramming   
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 101 
children’s minds with unnecessary and indigestible knowledge; and, on the other 
hand, it starves their characters by withholding from them instruction in the dog- 
mas of a particular sect. It is just a year ago since Lord Salisbury, at the meeting 
of the National Society, told his clerical supporters that it was their business to 
capture the board schools—to capture them, in the first instance, under the existing 
law, and then to capture them under a betterlaw. They have tried to capture them 
under the existing law, and up to the present moment the attempt has resulted in 
a disastrous failure. I believe I am accurate in saying that, since that challenge 
was thrown down, in if not all, at any rate in a vast majority, of the school-board 
elections that have taken place the ratepayers, on behalf of whose consciences 
and pockets this campaign was to be initiated, have declared in the most unequiv- 
ocal manner their attachment to the existing system and their indisposition to 
changeit. * * * 
The vice-president of the council, both on the first reading and again to-day, has 
dwelt exclusively upon the imperfections of the small rural schools. He has not 
said one word—nay, he disclaimed the intention—he has not said one word reflect. 
ing upon the majority of the great mass of the school boards of the country. But, 
because there happen to be in some scattered rural districts school boards which 
inadequately perform the duties cast upon them, they are to be made the founda- 
tion of an attack upon the mass of the school boards in the country. But the right 
honorable gentleman does not, even by his Dill, take steps to remedy the evils of 
which he complains. It surely would not pass the wit of man to devise a scheme by 
which, under'a system of grouping and enlargement of the area as regards ratabil- 
ity, there might be substituted for these small inadequate school boards an efficient 
educational authority. Under this bill the efficient school boards are to be sacri- 
ficed; they are to be hampered and mutilated, and the inefficient school boards aro 
not going to be improved. I have here figures showing how great has been the 
growing appreciation of the school-board system during the last ten years. In 1886 
there were in the Anglican schools connected with the National Society and tho 
Church of England 1,640,000 children, and in the school-board schools 1,296,000 
children, showing a majority in favor of the Anglican schools. But in 1895 thero 
were in the Anglican schools 1,880,000 children, and in the board schools 1,975,000 
children, so that not only has the relative position of the two classes of schools as 
regards children in attendance been reversed, but the rate of growth, which in the 
Anglican schools has been less than a quarter, has been more than half in the board 
schools. You may say in answer that this gives some claim to denominational 
schools for additional assistance; but the question I am dealing with is this, Does 
it constitute any ground for trying to depress the school-board system? « 
Iam all for leveling up, but the provisions of this bill in relation to school boards 
are, in my opinion, provisions for leveling down. As the right honorable gentle- 
man has acknowledged in his speech to-day, it is the competition with the school 
boards which has forced up the standard of teaching in voluntary schools, and which 
has created that strain of which the supporters of the voluntary schools complain. 
LIask those who are interested in education, and not merely in the rival claims of 
this or that sect, in the interests of education I ask the House to pause before it 
takes any step which would impair the efficiency of the board schools. I will say 
this of our school boards, they have attracted to their service in our municipal 
centers a large number of men who would have stood aloof altogether if they had 
not existed. If ever an experiment has been justified by its results it was the experi- 
ment of intrusting the management of primary education, not to town councils or 
county councils—bodies having a number of other duties to perform—but to a special 
body. In that way you secured in the service of education a set of men who, by their 
training and special qualifications, are peculiarly fitted to discharge the duties of 
their position. 
It is quite true, as the secretary for the colonies has pointed out, that twenty-five 
years ago, when Mr. Forster’s act was brought in, the first proposal was to intrust the
-P-A-G-E-178
102 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
work of education in our towns to town councils or committees appointed by them. 
Whatever might have been said for that proposal, prima facie it appears to me that the 
experience we haye had ought to convince us that we have adopted a more excellent 
plan. The proposal made twenty-five years ago, however, is not the proposal of this 
bill, and I believe that it would be far better to abolish the school boards altogether 
than to continue them in existence, as this bill proposes to do, with impaired powers, 
with fettered hands, and with discredited authority. 
Mr. Asquith then passed to the consideration of the financial bear- 
ings of the bill: 
Let me point out [he said] what those proposals are. As regards the special-aid 
grant, every board school which is entitled to it comes at once under the control of 
the education department, the committee of the privy council. If and when tho proc- 
ess of devolution from the education department to the local authorities proceeds, 
these school boards will become subject to those authorities. The local authorities 
will become their paymasters; they will be charged with the duties of inspection 
and examination, and they will have the power of giving or withholding the parlia- 
mentary grant. As regards expenditure by other school boards, it is limited for all 
time either to its present standard or to a maximum of 20s. per child. But at pres- 
ent the average expenditure per child, which is raised by rates, is 18s. 5d., and in 
many of our large towns it is vastly above 20s. The effect of the proposal in the bill 
will be that those large towns will be subject for all time to another authority inde- 
pendent of themselves. Look at the effect of the bill in the noncounty boroughs, of 
which there are 220. In the schools of these boroughs there are in attendance 
440,000 children, and in every one of these boroughs that has a school board the 
state of things will be this—the school board elected by the ratepayers will be sub- 
ject, as regards inspection and control, to a committee of the county council. For 
example, the school board of Dewsbury, or Scarborough, will for some purposes 
“be subject to a committee of the county council sitting at Northallerton, while as 
regards the rating for its expenditure it will be subject to its own town council. 
Thus the authority elected for education purposes will be hampered by two other. 
authorities, neither of whom is specially qualified to deal with educational matters. 
I say deliberately that I believe it would have been impossible for statesmanship to 
devise a scheme more calculated to engender friction and misunderstanding, and yet 
we are told that this bill contains no direct attack upon the school boards. * * * 
As regards existing expenditure, the object of the bill is to stereotype for all time 
the scale at present prevailing. You propose to prescribe three distinct limits to 
educational expenditure in this country. By the third clause the rate to be paid per 
scholar, including the fee grant to the education authority, is never to exceed the 
existing rate, or 29s. per head, whichever may be the highest. I believe I am right 
in saying that the rate at the present moment in voluntary schools averages 28s. 3d., 
and in board schools 29s. 4d. Thus, the voluntary schools have a small margin and 
the board schools have no margin at all; and let the House remember this provision 
is applied not only to present existing schools but to all new schools. However 
much the educational conditions of the country may change, and however great may 
be the rise in the stress of foreign competition, for all time to come, so long as this 
act of Parliament remains unrepealed, both school boards and voluntary schools are 
to be limited to the existing scale. Then, under the nineteenth clause, the ordinary 
grant, exclusive of the fee grant, is not to exceed the grant for this year, which is, 
as far as I can make out, to average 19s. a head. In the case of voluntary schools 
the average is 18s. 2d., and in the case of board schools, 19s. 2d.; so that there again 
the voluntary schools have a margin of 10d. and the board schools no margin at all. 
See how it will work out. In Birmingham and in London at the present moment tho 
ordinary grant is 19s. 5d. and 19s.8d. In Bolton it is 21s.2d.; so that Birmingham 
and London are never to be able, however much they may improve their educational | 
advantages, to rise to the standard of Bolton. 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 103 
Then, lastly, on this point, the school boards themselves aro not to raise a higher 
rate than 20s. per child without the consent of the local authority. Now, I ask, 
with reference to all these provisions, what is their purpose and object? Why aro 
you going to limit, of all forms of expenditure, the expenditure on education, and 
at a moment when you are spending upon naval defense out of the accumulated 
funds of last year and out of the mortgage of the funds of future years vast sums 
of money; at 2 moment when you are dipping into the surplus of this year and next 
year to provide special relief for the owners and occupiers of agricultural land? _ 
That is the moment selected for placing a limit for all time to come on that which 
should be the most elastic, the most fruitful, and the most beneficent of all forms 
of expenditure. I say that this proposal is equally objectionable from a consti- 
tutional and from an educational point of view. You are taking advantage ofa 
transient parliamentary situation to bind the hands of future Houses of Commons 
in a matter which, under our constitution, falls peculiarly under the prerogative 
of this House, namely, the fixing of the amount and distribution of our national 
expenditure. Majorities in this House come and go, but there is a place where thero 
is a majority irrevocably devoted to your own party, and once this act of Parlia- 
ment is put on the statute book it will deprive the House of Commons of that which 
I conceive to be the most fundamental and invaluable of all its constitutional func- 
tions, namely, its absolute freedom to decide how the money raised by taxation 
shall be spent, And the matter is equally serious from the point of view of educa- 
tion. Hitherto the great leverage toward a high standard in education has been 
the competition between the different classes of schools. By this bill you are put- 
ting them, as it were, in water-tight compartments. You are preventing that possi- 
bility of rivalry between them which has been the most potent factor in educational 
progression in the past. 
Well, sir, I come next to’ the provisions with reference to the special-aid grant 
which the right honorable gentleman has exhorted us to appreach in a calm and 
philosophic spirit. Ishall endeavor to doso. The question has been asked moro 
than once if we are prepared to abolish voluntary schools and to substitute a uni- 
versal system of school boards and board schools. That question has not been raised 
by us. We have been quite content to acquiesce, and we have acquiesced, in the 
compromise arrived at in 1870, which, be it remembered, was resented—and I think 
legitimately resented—not only by the Nonconformists, but by education reformers 
at the time, like my right honorable friend the secretary for the colonies, as giving 
a very undue amount of favor to voluntary schools as compared with board schools. 
I will not suppose that my right honorable friend has changed his opinions. No; 
I do not see why he should doso. We havo been referred to the example of Scot- 
land, and I think the first lord of the treasury taunted my right honorable friend 
the member for Montrose and myself with ignorance of the educational system of 
the country we have the honor to represent. It is perfectly true in one sense that 
the schools of Scotland are denominational schools—that is to say, in the ordinary 
schools of Scotland the elements of the Presbyterian doctrine are taught, Presby- 
terianism being the religion of the vast majority of the population of the country, — 
and special provision being made for giving facilities for separate schools fer the 
minorities. But there is another element in the Scottish system to which the right 
honorable gentleman has not paid equal attention, and that is that in Scotland there 
is a school board in every parish. You might search Scotland from one end to the 
other without finding a single parish in which the parish school is supported by 
public funds and to which the children of the ratepayers are compelled by law to 
resort, where the appointment and dismissal of teachers are in the hands of the 
parish minister or elders. If you will give us the Scottish system the denomina- 
tional question will rapidly solve itself. 
What is the position of voluntary schools? As I say, so far as I am aware no 
one proposes to abolish them or to incur the enormous expenditure, estimated at 
£25,000,000 by the right honorable gentlemen, or even half that sum, that would be
-P-A-G-E-180
    104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
involved in taking over the voluntary schools. I am perfectly ready to reckon the 
‘yoluntary schools as an integral part of our educational system; but when these 
special claims are put forward by the supporters of voluntary schools to exceptional 
treatment it is necessary to closely scrutinize the facts. We are told by the right 
honorable gentleman opposite, and the phrase has become classical, that the volun- 
tary schools and their supporters are “subjected to an intolerable strain.” But 
what are the facts? Since 1839, when the system of national education was ini- 
tiated, no less than £58,000,000 sterling of public money has been granted to the 
voluntary schools. At the present moment, including the fee grant, very nearly, if 
not quite, three-fourths of the maintenance is borne by the State. At the outside 
one-sixth of the cost of maintenance is found by voluntary subscription. It is quite 
true that although subscriptions have not increased per head they have increased in 
the aggregate since 1870; but that increase, if you have regard to the contempora- 
neous growth of the wealth and population of the country and in the zeal of men of 
all parties and faiths in the cause of education, is not very remarkable. 
Nor is it easy to estimate how much of these so-called voluntary subscriptions is 
really what is known as a voluntary rate, which persons impose upon themselves in 
the hope that they will thereby avoid the increased expenditure which would result 
from the establishment of a school board and more efficient teaching. I do not care 
to dwell on the precise number of parish schools to which there is no subscription; 
but it is a remarkable fact that the places where this so-called strain is most felt are 
some of the large towns in the north of England, whero the fees used to be high and 
the subscriptions have always been low, and where a deficiency has been produced 
by the abolition of fees and the substitution of a fee grant of 10s. per head, I find, 
for instance, in Manchester the average subscription per child is 8s. 6d., and in Liy- 
erpool it is as low as 3s, These facts, when dispassionately considered, go far to 
show that there is no very excessive strain. 
But I am perfectly prepared to agree—-and I believe that everybody on this side of 
the House will agree—that if you can show us that, either in the voluntary or in the 
board schools, there are cases where, from lack of resources, education is being starved 
or inefficiently provided—if you can show that the only means of making up the 
deficiency and of raising the level of the education given to the proper standard is by 
further grants from the public funds, then, subject to two or three very simple con- 
* ditions, there will be no opposition on our part. What are those conditions? They 
are very intelligible and very rational; and they are certainly supported by the most 
weighty authorities. The first is that whatever money is given should be impar- 
tially distributed—impartially not only as between voluntary schools themselves, 
but as between voluntary and board schools. On that point I found myself on the 
authority of the lord president of the council, who, as late as November last, when 
we supposed that this bill was in the initial stage of preparation, said: ‘‘I do not 
conceive that it is proposed by any legislation to depart from the principle of statu- 
tory equality as regards state aid to voluntary and board schools.” In the second 
place, whatever is given ought to be given under conditions which will secure that it 
shall be spent on the improvement of education and not in the relief of subscribers 
and ratepayers. 
It is for that reason that we say that a local contribution in one fori or another 
shall be an essential condition of every grant. Unless you have that you have no 
guarantee, except such as the central authority’s inspection affords against waste 
and extravagant expenditures. The act of 1870 required that the voluntary contri- 
bution or the contribution from local sources should be equivalent to the Parlia- 
mentary grant. That was modified in 1876 by the fixing of the 17s. 6d. limit. But 
on this point I am content to rely on authority. I will take two authorities, the 
weight and value of which can not be disputed by honorable gentlemen opposite. 
The first is the Bishop of London. In 1888, when he was a member of the commis- 
sion on education then sitting, the Bishop of London moved an amendment to the 
majority report which was thus expressed: ‘We can not recommend that in any case
-P-A-G-E-181
  ! 
THE ENGLISH ee BILL OF 1896. 105 
the grant from the department shall exceed the amount provided on the spot; nor - 
is it, in our judgment, a sufficient plea for overriding this principle that the people 
on the spot are unwilling to contribute enough.” There is another authority, even 
higher in rank, the Archbishop of Canterbury himself, who, on November 21 last, at 
a deputation to Lord Salisbury, said: “‘ We are willing to have a certain proportion 
of subscriptions insisted on as a condition of the grant.” A 
Thirdly, it ought to be made essential, as a condition of these schools receiving 
further money from the State, that you should introduce into their management some 
public representative element. There are in this country at the present moment 
8,000 parishes in which the enly school is a Church of England school. In those 
parishes the Nonconformists are compelled by law to send their children to school, 
and there is no other place to send them than the church school. And yet the abso- 
lute control, subject to the conscience clause, of the teaching and management of 
those schools, and of the all-important question, the appointment of the teachers, 
the determination of what duties those teachers are to perform and subject to what 
tenure they shall hold their offices—the absolute control is in the hands of irrespon- 
sible managers. I do not proposethat we should destroy the denominational schools, 
and, if we are not to destroy them, I agree that they must continue to be denomina- 
tional in character. But Iam perfectly satisfied that if you can introduce into the 
management of these schools an element—and I use the word advisedly—of repre- 
sentative management; if, for instance, the provision of this bill which allowsa 
reasonable number of parents to demand separate religious instruction could be | 
applied to this case, so that a reasonable number of parents might demand repre- 
sentation on the board of managers, then a vast number of the abuses which at 
present prevail and the grievances under which the rural ratepayers suffer would, 
from the mere fact of the infusion of this popular element, almost immediately dis- 
appear. 
As regards the religious instruction clause Mr. Asquith said: 
The principle which has governed us hitherto in this matter has been this. We 
have two sets of schools. First, the board schools, entirely supported out of public 
resources, imperial and local. In those schools the teaching of any religious for- 
mulary or catechism is absolutely prohibited. We have another class of schools— 
denomination schools—which are largely supported out of the public funds. Yet, 
as in the view of the framers of the act of 1870, they were to continue to make sub- 
stantial contributions of their own, they have given to them the power, while sub- 
ject to a conscience clause, to teach any religious formulary they please. That is 
the compromise which has worked for twenty-five years. What occasion is there to 
disturb it? This new clause, which professes to be framed in the interests of Non- 
conformist parents in our villages, will, so far as those villages are concerned, be an 
absolute dead letter. I have never heard any demand put forward on the part of 
those who are entitled to speak for these bodies for any such privilege as the bill 
proposes to give them. And when we know that in a large number of these villages 
the conscience clause itself is a dead letter, for reasons very intelligible, but on 
which I need not dwell, will it be supposed. that the parents of those children, who 
do not now claim for their children even the exemption allowed by the conscience 
clause, are going to incur—and there is no disguising the fact that they would incur— 
a considerable amount of odium and disfavor from those who control to a large 
extent the fortunes of their daily lives, by claiming for their children their distine- 
tive religious teaching in church schools? 
If this clause is to be taken advantage of at all it will be taken advantage of to 
get rid of the Cowper-Temple clause in towns. As to that I will only say one word. 
The religious teaching which is being given in our board schools is teaching which 
to a large extent has been molded and approved by churchmen. The highest pos- 
sible testimony has been borne to its value by not a few bishops of the church. 
ED 96——4*  
-P-A-G-E-182
    106 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
+ Iread a remarkable passage in the speech of one of the most respected bishops, the 
bishop of Durham, at Darlington, a day or twoago. He said he did not believe that 
the power which was given by this clause would be largely exercised. If the reli- 
gious instruction given in the board schools was not all that was required, what 
was wanting, he said, would be supplied elsewhere. He believed that the greater 
completeness would be dearly purchased by the interference with the regular course 
of the school instruction. 
What evidence is there, I ask, that the parents of the children for whom this 
religious instruction is provided are dissatisfied? This agitation is a clerical agita- 
tion. Itis carried on for the most part by the most extreme members of the clergy 
and by a body of laymen who are more clerically minded than the clergy themselves. 
Ido not believe myself that the parents will be found to avail themselves of this 
clause; but I can conceive that, under the stimulus of a more or less fanatical propa- 
ganda, it may be possible to get together in some of our towns a sufficient number 
of parents to make the demand. I ask the House to consider, if the demand were 
granted, whatits effect would be? What would be its effect upon our local elections? 
It will introduce into them, with a vastly increased amount of bitterness than we 
have before experienced, the element of sectarian strife. What will be its effect 
upon religious life itself? It will destroy, or at any rate impair, its charities and 
amenities. What will be its effect upon the children themselves? At present in 
these board schools they are taught a form of religious teaching which has this 
peculiarity, no doubt, that it consists mainly, if not entirely, of those facts and 
principles upon which all the churchesagree. If this clause were carried into effect 
and worked upon a large scale, you would have those children herded—if I may use 
the word—into: separate theological pens, branded and labeled with the names of 
their particular sects, and taught under conditions which must compel them, if they 
have fairly receptive minds, to attach more importance, not to those truths which 
unite, but to those things that divide. This is, I suppose, the legislative embodi- 
ment of the inalienable right of the parent to have his child taught in any religion 
at the public expense. But where does this right come from? What is its origin? 
Where are its sanctions? In what line of any act of Parliament is. any trace of it 
to be found? Itis a metaphysical figment of the newest and crudest character. 
Iam convinced that, as regards this clause, the good sense of the country and the 
parents of the children will repudiate it. But, if it is adopted, it will be found to 
have a most deleterious and damaging effect upon the whole of our educational 
work and of our civic life. I have endeavored to demonstrate step by step every 
branch of the general condemnatory proposition with which I started, and of which 
the amendment I am about to-move is the only adequate parliamentary expression. 
We are well aware of the fate which awaits that amendment in the division lebby. 
Tt will be rejected, I have no doubt, by an overwhelming majority. But this is only 
the preliminary stage in what is destined to be astubborn and protracted campaign. 
You can succeed, if you are ill advised enough to try the experiment, by the use of 
your overbearing parliamentary majority, in placing this measure, with its absurdi- 
ties and injustices, upon the statute book. But be assured that if you do so you 
are not settling, but you are opening, the controversy. Holding as we do, with as 
great a strength of conviction as it is possible for men to possess, that this bill if 
carried into law would create invidious inequalities; would embitter sectarian strife ; 
would introduce friction and confusion over the whole area of our local government; 
and would permanently degrade the level of our system of national education, we 
are bound to give ‘to it every opposition in our power, and, as the first step in the 
performance of that duty, I now beg to move that this bill be read a second time 
this day six months. (Schoolmaster, April 9, 1896, pp. 873-875.) ‘ 
Tn reply to a letter from Mr. W. Ansell, member of the Birmingham 
school board, who wrote to Mr. Chamberlain pointing out what he  
-P-A-G-E-183
  THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 107 
regarded as blemishes in the Government education bill, Mr. Cham- 
berlain replied as follows: 
40 PRIncrs Garvens, 8. W., April 19, 1896. \_ 
Dear Sir: I am extremely obliged to you for your letter of the 16th instant, with 
the information as to your views on the education bill of the Government. I am 
desirous of learning what were the special objections which your experience of edu- 
cational matters led you to entertain to the Government proposals, and I now pro- 
ceed to offer some explanations which I hope may serve to, at all events, reduce the 
number of points at issue. 
In the first place I must frankly express my entire and absolute disagreement with 
your general accusation that the whole tendency of the bill is to remove the direct 
control of education from the people and place it in the hands of irresponsible bodies. 
On the contrary, I believe that the main result of this measure will be to give much 
greater control to the people and to their direct representatives over primary educa- 
tion, and especially to extend the local influence and interest in the subject. This 
result will be secured by the decentralization, of whichI am glad to see you approve 
as a principle, and I anticipate that when the bill becomes law there will be much 
greater freedom than at present, and the tendency to stereotype all education accord- 
ing to an official standard will be checked in favor of local initiative and local 
experience. 
Coming now to the special objections taken by you, I find myself unable to agree 
with your first point in regard to the constitution of the new educational authority. 
This authority will be a statutory committee elected by the town or county councils, 
which are at present the most representative and popular local bodies in the bor- 
oughs and counties. A majority of the new committee will be members of the coun- 
cil directly elected by the people; the minority will be selected, as in the case of the 
free libraries committee, for special reasons, and because they are exceptionally qual- 
ified to deal with educational matters. They will be subject to the general instruc- 
tions of the council, and will, no doubt, report to it like other committees, so that 
their proceedings will be public and subject to popular criticism and control. This 
provision of the bill is in accordance with the principles advocated by the Birming- 
ham league in 1870. We then contended strenuously that the town councils should 
be the controlling authority in regard to primary education, and we protested against 
the creation of a new local authority, elected under the exceptional provision of the 
cumulative vote, and therefore not likely to be in any true sense of the word repre- 
sentative of the ratepayers. I think our predictions have been amply verified, and 
that the school boards have, as arule, under this exceptional arrangement, been com- 
posed of members who have represented sectarian differences and special views on 
many subjects, but who have not in the true sense of the word been representative 
of the general opinion of the constituency. Besides this, the interest taken in the 
election has always been less than that shown in parliamentary or municipal con- 
tests, and the board has generally been elected by the votes of a small proportion of 
the electors. As a Liberal, therefore, I hold now, as I did in 1870, that the town 
councils and county councils in agricultural districts are much better qualified to 
represent public opinion than the present school board authorities. 
As regards your second and third objections, namely, the differentiation between 
board and voluntary schools in the special aid grant and absence of any proviso that 
voluntary subscriptions shall at least retain their present level, I feel that there is 
prima facie much to be said, and I have no doubt that these questions will receive 
the fullest consideration in the committee on the bill. 
Your fourth objection, namely, the subordination of existing school boards to 
county councils, must stand or fall with your criticism as to the constitution of the 
new education authority. If, as I hold, the new education authority is much more 
representative than the existing school board, there can be no possible objection to 
, giving it the slight control which is provided for in the bill. I do not hesitate to
-P-A-G-E-184
  108 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
say for myself that I should be glad to extend the principle further—even to the 
extent of the full adoption of the policy of the old Birmingham league. 
In regard to your last three objections, which concern the appointment of teach- 
ers, the requirement of extraneous duties as a condition of engagement in denom- 
inational schools, and the absence of a conscience clause in denominational training 
colleges, I feel that they are subjects for discussion in committee. At the same time 
I ought to point out to you that the raison d’étre of a denominational school is that 
the religious teaching given should be, as far as permitted by the educational act, 
under the control of the managers and subscribers of the school, and it would be 
evidently inconsistent with the continued existence of denominational schools at 
all that their rights in this respect should be materially diminished. For reasons 
which I publicly stated to my constituents five years ago in distributing prizes at 
the Brookfields board school, I have been forced to the conclusion that it is neither 
practicable nor desirable to throw upon the ratepayers the whole expense of educa- 
tion now given in the voluntary schools of the country, and if this be granted it 
would be improper to attempt to secure by a side wind what can not and ought not 
to be attempted by direct action. (Schoolmaster, April 25, 1896.) 
The bill as already stated passed the second reading four weeks from 
the date of its presentation and entered upon committee stage. It soon 
became apparent that the chief point of attack was not to be either the 
limit of expenditure or the religious instruction clause, but the new local 
authority. In fact, the hostile forces with whom no compromise was 
possible were the 220 noncounty boroughs of the country. In the 
second week of the committee stage the debate was still waging over 
the first clause. At that time an amendment was moved by Sir A. K. 
Rollit (Conservative) providing that ‘“ municipal boroughs as well as 
county boroughs should be local educational authorities.” Though Sir 
John Gorst rejected the amendment it was accepted by Mr. Balfour as 
regards boroughs having a population of over 20,000. This added at 
least 45 educational centers to the 126 proposed in the bill as originally 
drawn. 
Mr. Balfour was immediately confronted with the case of urban dis- 
tricts of over 20,000 inhabitants, but the amendment in their interest 
was defeated. It developed at once that the Government majority had 
dwindled from 267 to 74, and in the midst of inextricable confusion 
Mr. Balfour announced first a limit of time for the further debate of the 
bill and subsequently its postponement to January next. This action, 
as already stated, was tantamount to abandoning the measure. The 
bearing of Mr. Rollit’s amendment was clearly exposed by Sir W. Vernon- 
Harcourt! in a speech on the withdrawal of the bill. After reviewing 
its proposals and the course of the debate Mr. Harcourt continued: 
At the commencement of this measure, was it the opposition alone who were 
opposed to this bill? County council after county council throughout the country 
had condemned the bill, and had declared that they would take no part in carrying 
it out. Devonshire, the West Riding, and many other counties condemned the bill; 
but when that amendment was introduced, at the instance or by the consent of the 
right honorable gentleman, there was a meeting held upon Friday last by the execu- 
tive of the united county councils of the whole of England. There wero present 
there, representing the county councils association, the Duke of Bedford, the Earl 
  
1Chancellor of the exchequer in Mr. Gladstone’s third and fourth ministries.  
-P-A-G-E-185
  THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 109 
of Morley, Lord Herries, Sir John Dorrington, Sir Richard Paget, Mr. Bill, Mr. Hob- 
house, Colonel Williams, and many others distinguished in the Tory party, and added 
to these were the clerks of the East Riding of Yorkshire, Leicestershire, Monmouth- 
shire, Lancashire, Bedfordshire, East and West Sussex, Middlesex, and Shropshire. 
They met together, and, with ono exception, unanimously condemned this bill. The 
vice-president of the council the other day prided himself upon the support which 
he had received from Lancashire and from Sir John Hibbert. Sir John Hibbert, who 
ought to have taken the chair at that meeting, was judiciously absent, and the clerk 
to the Lancashire county council said: ‘‘The result of Mr. Balfour’s concession would 
be that in Lancashire alone there would be as many as 46 educational authorities. 
Only yesterday the technical instruction committee resolved that the change would 
strike a serious blow at the administration of the technical instruction acts, and that 
under those circumstances they considered that the county council could not with 
advantage undertake the additional duties proposed to be conferred upon them in 
regard to public clementary education.” That was the repentance of the Lanca- 
shire county council, and that was their withdrawal of the support which they had 
previously given to the bill. And then the right honorable gentleman says it is we 
who, by our factious opposition, have defeated this bill. What are the real facts of 
the origin and disappearance of this bill I do not know whether we shall ever really 
learn. But things will leak out on these occasions, and I observe that at this meet- 
ing of the executive of the county councils of England a gentleman who seems to 
have known something about it—the honorable member for Somerset (Mr. Hob- 
house)—is reported to haye said: ‘The parliamentary committee of the association 
of county councils drew up a list of reasons why noncounty boroughs should not be 
constituted separate educational authorities. These reasons were duly handed to 
Sir John Gorst, and apparently met with his approval, for his speech on Thursday 
last ran exactly on the lines of those reasons. It was therefore greatly to his sur- 
prise that within half an hour of Sir John Gorst having made his speech, and without 
any opportunity having been given to any representative of the county councils in 
the House of Commons to speak against the amendment, the first lord of the treasury 
got up and made the concession which was so much deplored. There was no doubt 
that the amendment was moved on other than purely educational grounds. Sir 
Albert Rollit had stated publicly that the boroughs would nover rest content until 
they had broken down the line which was fixed at a population of 50,000 by the act 
of 1888, not only for educational but for all administrative purposes.!| That was what 
made the concession of such vital importance to nearly all county councils.” * * * 
  
1The following analysis and classification of English boroughs, with a pointed 
statement as to the effect of Mr. Rollit’s amendment, is taken from the Schoolmaster 
of June 20, 1896: 
“Under the bill there are 126 counties and county boroughs which would be com- 
pelled to form education authorities. In our issue of 16th of May we gave a list of 
the 64 county boroughs so affected. These we now reproduce: 
“ Barrow-in-Furness, Bath, Birkenhead, Birmingham, Blackburn, Bolton, Bootle, 
Bradford, Brighton, Bristol, Burnley, Bury, Canterbury, Cardiff, Chester, Coventry,

110 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
We were determined to oppose what you called the vital principles of your bill, 
because we saw in it, as explained by members of your own cabinet, a deliberate 
intention to wreck the school boards of England; because we have been told in 
violent terms by the prime minister and his bishops, and in violent terms by the 
right honorable gentleman, that they hoped and ee that the result of the bill 
would be that school esa would disappear. * * 
You thought that the school boards were unpopular with the nation and that you 
could trample upon them.. That was the spirit of the conferences at the foreign 
office, That was the language which was held throughout the winter, and it was 
upon that miscalculation that the bill was founded. You have discovered your mis- 
take. You have discovered that not alone on this side of the House but upon your 
own side of the House your attempts on the life of the school boards of the country 
haye met with repugnance and with opposition. Now, those, in my opinion, are 
the main grounds which have destroyed this bill. We have nothing to regret in the 
part we have taken in making clear to the country and the House what has been 
the true object and what has been the true character of this bill, This bill has 
education authority. Of course, if 1896 census returns should be used (as we pre- 
sume will be the case, seeing that the bill is now apparently to be hung up till next 
year), the list will have to be considerably augmented. We have, in a few cases 
only, included school districts, and these only because in some cases some of the 
constituent boroughs probably contain over 20,000 inhabitants. 
  “Municipal boroughs of over 20,000 which possess school boards. 
“Ashton-under-Lyne, Bacup, Barnsley, Batley, Brighouse, Burslem, Burton-on-

“But besides the above 43 municipal boroughs there are 7 whose population in 
1891 was very nearly 20,000, and which by this time will be able to claim to come . 
under this clause of the bill and form their own education authorities; and no doubt 
this number will have to be considerably augmented when the 1896 census is con- 
sidered as the basis of calculation. Sir J. Gorst, on Thursday week, in reply to Mr. 
J. Samuel, said that between the present time and the report stage he would consider 
the question whether boroughs under 20,000 on subsequently reaching that figure 
would automatically become independent educational authorities.

  failed because it was introduced without due consideration of the operation of the 
change which you proposed to effect. It has failed because oven your own party was 
not united upon it. It has failed because it has been conducted under a mandate 
from the House of Lords. It has been conducted under the instructions of those who 
knew nothing of the real feeling of the nation and who knew nothing of the real 
sentiments of its representatives. That is one of the main causes of the failure of 
this bill. It has failed because it was conceived in the interests of a party and for 
the promotion of the objects of a sect. If you will abandon these sources of weak- 
ness in the coming year; if you will come forward with a measure for the education 
of the people which is framed not in the interests of a party, not to fulfill the 
objects of a sect, then you will find from us no obstructive opposition. We have 
declared, and we are willing to show, that in any fair bill, not conceived in the 
spirit I have described, elementary cducation may be made a nonparty measure. If 
it is brought forward not with the object of destroying the school boards of Eng- 
land, but of assisting upon fair terms those schools which might be assisted—if it is 
a fair bill for the promotion of the education of the people—then it will be a bill 
Tess than 20,000. Some of them must by this time far exceed 20,000 in population, 
as the 1896 census will doubtless show.

«With regard to urban districts, Mr. Balfour last Thursday week, in reply to some 
remarks by Mr. Asquith, said that with regard to the question as to whether urban 
districts of over 20,000 inhabitants should have the power of forming their own edu- 
cation authorities, he would like to consider the question and give his decision at a 
later stage of the bill. This question was, however, reached on Monday night on an 
amendment by Mr. S. Evans to the effect that ‘the education authority which under 
clause 1 was to be given to boroughs of 20,000 inhabitants should be extended to 
urban districts.’ This was defeated by 265 to 143. 
“The result, then, of the acceptance of Sir A. K. Rollit’s amendment will be that 
to the 126 counties and county boroughs which have under the Dill to form educa- 
tion authorities must be added 43 municipal boroughs with school boards and 32 
municipal boroughs with attendance committees. To these will most likely have to 
be put 7 and 15 other municipal boroughs as soon as they reach 20,000 (and many of 
them have probably done that by this time); so that the number goes up almost at 
once from 126 to 222. 
“ This means an enormous increase in costly and duplicated machinery, possibly 
in new inspectors, in new codes of instruction, and certainly in elaborate official 
staffing and establishment charges.” 
The growth of urban populations in England must be taken into account in any con- 
sideration of the political influence of towns, The total urban population in 1891 was 
20,802,770, or 71.7 per cent of the entire population, Tho ratio of increase in urban 
population in the decade 1881-1891 was 15.3 per cent, as against an increase of 3.4 per 
cent for the rural population. From an analysis of the detfiled statistics it appears 
that 22 per cent of the population of England and Wales live in 6 towns of upward of 
250,000 inhabitants; 31.6 per cent (in 1881 29.6 per cent) in 24 (in 1881, 20) towns of over 
100,000 inhabitants; 40.6 per cent in 62 towns of over 50,000 inhabitants, 53.2 per cent 
in 182 towns of over 20,000 inhabitants, and 17,826,347, or 61.5 per cent, in 358 towns 
of over 10,000 inhabitants. In 1881 14,626,131, or 56.3 per cent, of the whole popula- 
tion, lived in 303 towns of over 10,000 inhabitants. (Statesmen’s Yearbook, 1896.) 
It should be added that the word ‘‘town” is here used in rather a loose sense, com- 
prising districts of concentrated population rather than having regard to a particular 
form of local government,

which will not disappear as this bill has disappeared under the force of public dis- 
cussion, but will be a bill which may make a permanent settlement of the greatest 
aim to which the House of Commons can direct its attention— namely, the education 
of the people. [Schoolmaster, June 27, 1896, pages 1163-1165.] 
Outside of Parliament the discussion of the measure was vigorously 
maintained. Among many articles in the leading English periodicals 
none carried greater weight than that from the pen of Sir Lyulph Stan- 
ley, one of the notable leaders of the public-school movement, and long 
identified with the progressive party of the London school board. His 
review of the bill is here reproduced, with slight omissions: 
The proposals now before the country in the education bill of the Government do 
not err in the direction of moderation. Not content with propounding a scheme for 
the organization on a public basis of secondary education, the Government invites 
us to revolutionize our elementary system and to reverse the whole policy of the 
act of 1870. Hitherto we have been accustomed to suppose that when important 
institutions had been established, and had built up round them an elaborate and 
working system, changes proposed would only affect details, and that conservatism 
in this country would respect past legislation and not assume the reactionary aspect 
of the continental counter reyolution. It is unfortunate that the present Govern- 
ment, although it is supposed to represent the alliance of moderate Liberalism with 
Conservative defense of the constitution, has utterly disregarded more prudent coun- 
sels, and has propounded a scheme which may be satisfactory to those clerical forces 
which can not bear to see popular education slipping out of their grasp, and which 
will also please those who resent the expansion of popular instruction, and who 
would far rather see public money spent on military preparations and relief to land- 
owners than in the improved education of the people. 
It may be difficult to explain how the present bill will work if it should become 
law. But there can be no doubt that it will severely hamper the growth of public 
education and place its development under the control of the absolutely noneduca- 
tional forces of local self-government. It establishes differential taxation in favor of 
private sectarian management, and discourages local effort by withholding public 
aid where local contribution is largest. It subsidizes voluntary schools out of the 
rates without giving the ratepayers a voice in their management, and, under the pre- 
tense of doing away with a too minute system of public aid, it does much to super- 
sede all central direction and organization, which for years to come must be one of 
the guaranties of progress. 
So far as it introduces a local controlling financial power, that power is to be used 
not for the purpose of compelling remote and ignorant local bodies to improve their 
teaching, but for the purpose of hampering progressive local bodies. 
It exposes the body which is to direct secondary education to all the drawbacks 
that must result from associating it with the controversies and feuds which charac- 
terize the politics pertaining to elementary schools, and it fails to evolve any order 
from the present chaos by omitting to organize throughout the country local authori- 
ties of suitable area which shall at once be invested with the necessary power to do 
in all cases what can now be done by school boards where they exist. 
While recognizing the unsatisfactory character of the parochial school board area, 
it does not in reality supersede it, but, so far as it provides a new area, rushes into 
the opposite extreme and gives us an authority which while suitable as to area for 
secondary education, is far too large for the purposes of elementary education. In 
short, it is a bill so bad in its principles and essential details that no recognition of 
it should be admitted, and its faults do not admit of being corrected in committee 
after conceding a second reading.  
-P-A-G-E-189
THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 113 
Let us first examine the bill as it bears upon elementary education. 
- It creates a new authority, the county council. This county council becomes, out- 
side of municipal boroughs, through its education committee, the school board of 
the future, wherever school boards do not now exist. In municipal boroughs, other 
than county boroughs, the town council will in future become the school board. But 
existing school boards will lead a precarious life. They will apparently pass rapidly 
through a transition such as Madagascar has experienced, passing through depend- 
ence under a protectorate to extinction and absorption in the direct domain of the 
new authority. 
The county council is to act through a committee. But apparently, except in the 
case of Wales and London, the county council has a free hand; it may or may not 
appoint outsiders, but probably the education committee must be a portion and not 
the whole of the county council. 
‘Thus we pass at once from a body elected for educational purposes to a body elected 
for noneducational purposes. Everyone knows that municipal contests, and still 
more clections to rural county councils, do not turn at all on eaucational questions, 
and it is very unlikely that the addition of educational functions to the existing 
duties of a county council will materially modify the considerations which will lead 
candidates to present themselves as electors to vote. If the election of school 
boards required modification by the abolition of the cumulative vote, the periodic 
replacement of the members and the enlargement of the area, these changes could 
have been brought about without the abolition of school boards in principle, which 
is really the purpose and effect of this bill. 
Again, the area for elementary school government should certainly not be so 
large as the county. The parish is undoubtedly too small, though the commune is the 
usual unit on the Continent, where public education has been organized long before 
England. Still it must be admitted that the parochial area, both for administration 
and for the incidence of taxation, is on many grounds insufficient for producing the 
best educational results. The area, however, of the district council would have been 
sufficient, and would have enabled us to secure (1) a sufficient number of competent 
representatives; (2) an area not too large for the members of the board to have some 
personal knowledge of the whole of their district; (3) a sufficient number of schools 
to educate the board by a comparison of their respective cfficiency—and this is a 
most important consideration; (4) an area of taxation which would correct the 
undue pressure in any particular part, and would enable the board to deal fairly 
with the needs of the whole of the district. 
The present bill, however, proposes an organization which can only be described 
as ludicrous. The county council, say of Devonshire or Norfolk, becomes, through 
its education committee, the potential school board for Devonshire or Norfolk. If 
hereafter any new parochial school board is needed, the county council committee 
will almost inevitably become the school board; it may also, and probably will, 
take over the functions of many existing school boards, and becomes the school 
attendance committee for all parts of the county not included in municipal boroughs 
or school board areas. Nevertheless, the charge of enforcing school attendance is 
not to be defrayed by a general charge over the portions of the county under the 
administration of the county committee, but is apparently to be met by special 
rates levied in the respective poor-law unions or portions of poor-law unions. 
So, too, the school board rate levied by the new county authority will be separate for 
each parochial school board area, and separate accounts will have to be kept, and 
the county authority will have to sit for a quarter of an hour as the school board for 
Black Acre, then as the school board for White Acre, for Bishop’s Stoke, for King’s 
Stoke, and Earl’s Stoke, and all the successive parishes it will have to administer. 
There is apparently power for the county authority, if it pleases, to convert these 
special rates into one general rate leviable in the parishes for which it acts as a 
school board (section 11), but prima facie the rates are to be separate.
-P-A-G-E-190
114 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The importance of this question of the rate is apparent when we remember another — 
important new provision of the bill, that the county council is to restrain the spend- 
ing power of the school boards. { 
If the maintenance rate in a district exceeds £1 a head, where it has not already 
done so, the school board must get the leave of the county council to spend more. 
Let it be noted that, so anxious is the bill to cripple education, this supervising 
power is not given to the new county education authority, which will be, in time, 
more or less familiar with the needs of education; it is given to the county council 
itself, in which all the members, who care nothing for education, and who have 
not wished to join the education committee, will vote. - 
Nay, more. So anxious are the authors of the bill to keep down education that 
it is actually provided in the case of an urban sanitary district, not a borough, and 
conterminous with a parish, that whereas the education committee of the county 
council will be the school board for the district, the authority whose leave must be 
obtained before the cost of maintenance from the rates exceeds £1 a head will be the 
local board and not the county council. Anyone who knows the type of specula- 
tive builder and others who frequently form a local board will know what readiness 
they will show to consent to taxation for education. Moreover, their instincts of 
local patriotism will be enlisted against their new school board. Fancy a populous 
urban parish in Lancashire of some 20,000 inhabitants whose schools are adminis- 
tered by the county education committee of Lancashire. That county education 
committee will plan the schools, determine their site, fix the number and scale of 
salaries of teachers, and generally make all the rules for the administration of the 
schools, On that education board probably not one resident from the town in ques- 
tion willhave a seat, and yet, subject to the £1 limit for expenditure from the rates 
in maintenance, this external body will have the whole government of the schools. 
Is this local government? Is it not rather a caricature of local government? 
‘Where is to be found the natural correlation of taxation and representation? 
Another hardship is that the governing body will be largely, even preponderatingly, 
elected by those who contribute nothing to this or any school board. In many 
counties of England the bulk of the rural population who elect the county council 
are not in school board areas, Let the area of existing school boards be extended 
by all means, but let the new area which furnishes the new governing body be an 
area sharing the burdens, and therefore equally responsible in feeling with the old 
restricted area. 
No doubt some element of local management is preserved by elause 10, which enacts 
that in a rural parish half the managers shall be nominated by the parish council 
and half by the county education authority. But this clause itself is full of absurd- 
ities. It says that the county council shall delegate their powers of control and 
management; but who shall say how much this means? Does it mean the appoint- 
ment and dismissal of teachers? This seems hardly consistent with the act of 1873. 
Moreover, section 15 of the act of 1870 is incorporated, which gives the school board 
power to dismiss the managers. Is one body to appoint and another to dismiss? At 
any rate, management can not include settling the salaries and numbers of the staff 
or any general rules as to qualifications which the county school board may draw 
up. The clause would open the door to endless opportunities of friction and conflict. 
Again, in a county borough the education committee is to nominate the managers; 
but in any other borough, while an education committee must be appointed to act 
for the borough council, yet the borough council and not the education committee 
is to nominate the managers, and in an urban district which is also a school district 
the local board will nominate the managers, Can anyone fancy the confusion and 
conflicts that would arise from such a state of things? 
The fact is that the moment you give local administration to a body not chosen by 
those whose money they are to spend you introduce a principle absolutely opposed 
to the history and principles of our local self-government; and all this is done to 
propitiate clerical opposition and to call into existence anew body which will super- 
sede the hated school board.
-P-A-G-E-191
THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 115 
Let us pass for a moment from the county council education committee as an admin- 
istrative body charged with the local supply of elementary education to its functions 
as a superintending body over local elementary education, intrusted by the Govern- 
ment with the administration of the parliamentary grant and the inspection of 
schools. Here everything is vague, but in this vagueness all kinds of serious possi- 
pilities are latent. Surely in the first place it is unsatisfactory that the spending 
and the supervising authorities should be the same. In the North, Riding of York- 
shire the educational committee of the county council may be inspecting the school 
boards. of Scarborough, Whitby, Thornaby, and other popular centers, and at the 
same time they may themselves be the school beard for little towns like Thirsk, 
Malton, Northallerton, Pickering. Is it desirable that a body which is itself admin- 
istering, and probably on asmaller scale and with less experience, should superintend 
and ultimately control the education of substantial towns? 
Again, take the county boroughs. Is there any reason to suppose that the town 
council of Middlesbrough or of York is more fit to make rules under whieh the science 
and art and other grants of those towns shall be administered than the school boards 
of the same towns? Take Hull, a town where the school board has worked at the 
lowest cost possible, and yet has done much in its higher grade schools for improving 
popular education. What has the town council of Hull done that it should be thought 
more fit to represent the interests of the ratepayers and the interests of education 
than the school board of Hull, equally elected by the people? 
Those coneerned in education locally will be glad to see more intellectual light 
introduced in high places at Whitehall and South Kensington, but they may be 
excused if they doubt whether the twilight of the education department is not better 
than the outer darkness of such county boroughs as Wigan, or Stockport, or Birken- 
head, or Canterbury. The zeal of a convert is proverbial; but the vice-president 
had better pause before he adores that which he used to burn and burns that which 
he used to worship. 
Sir John Gorst, in his panic at the overminute supervision of the education 
department, makes a calculation that there are 32,000,000 blank spaces which haye 
to be looked into by his officials. In their enumeration they have omitted one blank 
space so vast that it figures as a Sahara in the map of their intelligence—the blank 
failure to understand that it has for years been in the power of the department to 
simplify without abdicating; to rely more, as they are beginning now to do, on 
inspection rather than detailed examination in determining the goodness of a school; 
to develop real local responsible educational authorities instead of relying on irre- 
sponsible volunteers, whose object, avowed by themselves, is not educational but 
denominational, whose first wish is not to create capable citizens, but devout and 
submissive Anglicans and Romanists; not to secure a schoolmaster who shall per- 
form an honorable, though humble, function for the whole community, but to obtain 
the unpaid services of an organist, Sunday-school teacher, and general ecclesiastical 
and parochial factotum. It is the pampering and preserving of a State-aided system 
under private, irresponsible management which has naturally led to the mechanical 
methods of the education department. 
It may be necessary to point to one or two provisions of the bill in order to justify 
the statement that it not only aims at the subordination, but at the extinction, of 
school boards. 
(1) Henceforward there can hardly be any rural school boards. Section 6 makes 
it almost certain that in future the county council will become the school board in 
rural areas. But section 6 seemingly makes it more difficult at once to call a school 
board into existence. Hitherto, where the school of a village was closed, the educa- 
tion department could, without notice, at once order the formation of a board. 
Section 6 seems in all cases to require the long routine of preliminary notices. The 
object of this, of course, is to do all that can be done to perpetuate clerical manage- 
ment and to prevent the people from managing their own schools. 
Section 7 makes it impossible hereafter in any borough to have an independent 
school board.
-P-A-G-E-192
  116 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Section 8 is to facilitate the extinction of school boards by the transfer of their 
schools to the new authority. But that there may bo no mistake as to the real 
object of the bill, which is to prevent the extension of public management and to 
maintain and extend if possible private clerical management, these new county 
authorities are not made at once school boards for the purpose of taking over exist- 
ing schools. Under subsection 2 of section 8 it is only after the necessary steps 
have been taken for the formation of a school board in any district that the now 
county authority can take over a public elementary school under section 23 of the 
education act of 1870. If there had been a real wish to simplify and to secure what 
the framers of the bill must be supposed to wish—the establishment everywhere of 
a proper local educational authority—the new county authority would have been 
declared to be the school Doard for all those portions of the county not already 
under school boards. Subsection 3 of section 8 does not make the county education 
authority the school board for its district—that is, for the county as a whole—but 
only for the district; that is, the district in which the school proposed to be trans- 
ferred is situated. 
Again, section 9 provides that where the education department declares a school 
board in default, or declares that any school board has not properly performed any 
of its duties under the education acts, the education department may constitute 
the county education authority the school board. Was ever such arbitrary power 
bestowed on a department of state; practically on a vice-president of the council? 
If the school board for London is at variance with the department; if, to take an 
extreme instance, the school board for London in any one of its 400 schools, in any 
one of its 1,200 departments, has not, in the opinion of the department, properly per- 
formed its duties, which include minute observance of any one article of the code, 
the education department may, by mere administrative edict, put an end to the 
school board. If this were law, the school boards of the country would live with 
the sword of Damocles suspended over their heads. Since James II arbitrarily used 
corrupt and subservient judges to crush municipal liberty there has never been so 
sweeping a proposal. And even James’s subservient judges were obliged to use the 
forms of law; but Sir John Gorst, armed with a little brief authority, proposes to 
hold the school boards of the country in the hollow of his hand. Such a régime is 
fitter for the meridian of Moscow than that of London; and can it be believed that 
Parliament will so treat recognized legal representative bodies, the chief complaint 
against whom is that they have done their work so well that denominational zeal 
can not compete with them? 
Again, as evidence of the hostile attitude toward school boards, consider sub- 
section 3 of section 12: 
“The education department, on the application of the education authority, or of 
aschool board, may, if they think fit, make an order transferring to the education 
authority for any county any school or department of a school within the county, 
maintained by a school board, and providing education which, in the opinion of the 
education department, is other than elementary.” 
Here, too, schools the property of a school board may be taken away from the 
existing owners against their will. The words are not ‘‘on the application of the 
education authority and of the school board,” but either body may apply. There 
does not appear to bein the bill any clause compelling the new authority to continue 
to maintain such a school after it has been transferred. Not only may the education 
department rob the school board of a school, it may even rob it of a department of 
-aschool, There is no legal protection of a school board in any definition of what is 
elementary. 
Tho existing education acts define an elementary school as one in which the main 
part of the instruction is elementary, thus recognizing that a part of the instruction 
may be more than elementary. If all the work in the standards be considered ele- 
mentary, yet the code provides that scholars up to 14 years of age who have passed
-P-A-G-E-193
  THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 117 
the standards are still recognized, and the school receives the Parliamentary grant 
for them. : 
The free education act extended the age up to which the Parliamentary feo grant © 
was to be paid to 15. This limit was granted at the instance, among others, of Mr. 
Chamberlain, who pleaded for the encouragement of the advanced instruction given 
in some schools. No doubt a technicality of tho act, resulting from an amendment 
put in in the House of Lords, has prevented the full benefit being reaped from this 
enactment, but the hindrance was not intended or seen by the Government when 
they accepted the amendment, and they are honorably bound, and certainly Mr. 
Chamberlain is honorably bound, not to permit new legislation to recede from the 
principles recognized in the 1891. It can not be too much insisted on that classes 
beyond the standards which enable parents who are willing to keep their children 
at school up to 14 or 15 are not in any proper sense a part of secondary education, 
but merely a continuation and completion of primary education. The Biirger 
Schulen of Germany, which are elementary schools, give in their upper classes an 
education fully equal to what would be giyen in the best English elementary schools 
to tho ex-VII scholars. In France, besides the Ecoles primaries supérieures there 
are the ‘classes supplémentaires” in many ordinary primary schools. In England 
the growth of higher grade or upper standard schools has been recognized as sup- 
plying a want. These schools were approved by the majority of Lord Cross’s com- 
mission. Sir W. Hart Dyke spoke warmly in their favor before the commission on 
secondary education, and warned Sir John Gorst against withdrawing them from 
the school boards in the debate on the first reading of the bill under consideration. 
These schools are year by year furnishing a better preparation for our pupil teachers, 
whom Sir John Gorst professes his wish to improve, and whose apprenticeship the 
new code proposes to shorten. If an attempt were made to dissociate these classes 
from the elementary schools, out of which they have sprung, the result would be 
that the great mass of the scholars who now prolong their schooling would cut short 
their education. They would not go to secondary schools, where they would 
encounter higher fees, in some cases social inconveniences, and in all cases the incon- 
venience of a break in the course of their studies. Leaving, as most of them do, at 
14 or 14}, they would be presented with a truncated fragment of anew course of 
studies. Their ignorance of foreign languages would lead to their being placed in 
a class lower than they might be fit for on other accounts, and we should see a seri- 
ous injury done to our elementary schools by their decapitation. Some of the 
teachers of the less good secondary schools are especially jealous of these upper 
standard board schools, and are anxious to keep down the elementary school lest its 
superior teaching efficiency should outweigh the social prestige on which these sec- 
ondary teachers now rely for recruiting their scholars. ‘ 
But the figures of the education department show that there has been no material 
increase in the age of scholars in the elementary schools; the proportion between 13 
and 14 and over 14 to the whole of the population is almost constant. The improve- 
ment has come in the numbers between 11 and 12, These formerly were slipping 
away from school, owing to lax by-laws and low standards of exemption; but now 
the schools are stronger, not in the scholars who. have passed all the standards and 
who are over 13, butin the scholars in the V, VI, and VII standards and those between

Where such an animus against school boards and in fayor of private management 
and of denominational schools is manifest throughout the bill, it is natural that we 
should view with great suspicion the extreme vagueness with which the Dill is 
drawn. 
Section 2 is absolutely unmeaning as a definite operative enactment, but it suggests 
a bias to those who are to administer the act if it becomes law. ‘‘It shall be the 
duty of the education authority to supplement and not to supplant such existing 
organizations for educational purposes as for the time being supply efficient instruc- 
tion.” Weare all familiar with this passage, quoted from the debates of 1870. We- 
   
-P-A-G-E-194
  118 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
know that the great powers conferred upon school boards were thought by Mr. 
. Forster consistent with that statement. We know that he looked forward to the 
peaceful extension of school boards and the ultimate substitution of public for private ; 
management throughout the country. We know, too, how, though voluntary schools 
have doubled their accommodation and attendance since 1870, though they have 
been relieved of one obligation after another, though their contributions represent | 
an insignificant part of the cost and in many cases have entirely disappeared, yet 
they go on repeating this phrase as if the practical working of the act of 1870 had 
been a violation of this pledge; and now, with every private interest fortified by ; 
this platitude, encouraged to go to the education department to oppose all progres- 
sive education, we can but consider the insertion of these words thoroughly mis- 
chievous. * * * 
It is a singular mark of the spirit in which this bill has been drawn that none of 
the securities of the education act or of the technical education act are introduced 
into these proposals for the organization and public pecuniary support of secondary 
schools. And the absence of these securities makes the enactment of section 13 (1) 
the more dangerous, for by that section a local education authority may be forced to 
aid any school, however extreme in character, however unsuited to the locality; and 
under section 2 that school so aided may claim to keep out a more suitable school, 
even though the community desires it. 
Tt should be remembered that in this bill for the first time there is a discrimina-_ 
ion in publie grants avowedly hostile to school boards. All voluntary schools are, 
to receive an additional 4 shillings a head; a very small number of board schools are 
to receive a similar aid, and from that is to be deducted the aid they now receive. 
About 125 school boards would be eligible to receive the special grant, and it is evi-) 
dent that the total grant intended to be given to school boards is trifling, since the 
_ voluntary schools would receive about £470,000, and the total new grant is caleu-’ 
lated at £500,000. A few considerations will show how unjust and wasteful this new 
” grant is. { 
s First of all, it is supposed to relieve local necessity. The words of the bill are, 
.,for schools requiring special aid.” Yet all voluntary schools are to receive it, no 
‘matter what their circumstances. There aro more than a thousand voluntary schools 
with no voluntary subscriptions, and yet no obligation of any local effort is imposed | 
before making this new contribution. In school-board districts there is a distinet . 
security. There the new grant can only be paid in one of two cases: (1) Where a 
rate of 3 pence in the pound yields less than 7 shillings and 6 pence a head on the 
average attendance; (2) in small parishes, where a rate of 3-pence yields less than 
£20. If it is desirable to help poor districts still further, let the same rule be 
applied to voluntary schools—let them be required to show that they have raised 7 
shillings and 6 pence a head by voluntary subscriptions, or that they have raised 
such a.sum by voluntary subscription as a 3-penny rate would yield. If this were 
done it would at any rate be shown that the intention of the bill is to aid local 
effort. Again, this grant is to be paid to schools levying fees on the scholars. Itis 
clear that the managers are not entitled to get further public aid where they con- 
tribute little or nothing, and continue to exact fees from the parents. The way in 
which difficulties are thrown in the way of parents desiring free education, both by 
the department and by local managers, shows that the free education act has by no 
means been mado as effective as it should be. 
The department reckons accommodation as available in Roman Catholic schools 
and in schools where buildings, equipment, and teaching are most unsuitable, and 
unless parents are willing to have their children forced into these schools, and pos- 
sibly send them some distance from home, it is said that they must continue to pay 
fees, for they have no right to demand free schooling in the school most convenient 
‘te them." **.: * 
The bill does not enable the new county authority to call on rural boards to do 
more where their efforts and expenditure are insufficient. Its power is one only for 
restraint on expenditure, not for compelling further efficiency.
-P-A-G-E-195
‘THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. gS 
Why should the school board for London or Leeds or Liverpool be called on to 
satisfy the town council or county council that the requirements of education require 
inereased expenditure? The school board is elected by the same persons; but at the 
election of the school board the electors had definitely before them the fact that they 
were choosing those who should manage their schools. 
It is extremely probable that in the extreme desire to profess economy which char- 
acterizes most municipal bodies, and having regard to the prominent place that the 
rate of expenditure occupies in the diseussions at municipal elections, a town council 
will always seek to get forgiveness and oblivion for any sins it may have committed 
by parading the fact that it has refused permission to the school board to spend 
beyond its limit. Suppose it were the other way, and any special expenditure on 
parks, recreation grounds, public baths, electric lighting, or any of the various forms 
of expenditure which arise in municipal life were submitted to the school board for 
approval! The proposal would be ridiculous, but not more ridiculous than to let 
these local authorities, engrossed in sewage and paving, judge of the propriety of an 
expenditure which sets pupil teachers free from teaching during half their time in 
order that they may have more time for study. 
If reason and precedent were to determine political questions, this enslavement of 
mind to matter would not move our apprehension; but the danger’is serious, in the 
face of the large majority which the country, to save its political unity, gave to Lord 
Salisbury, and which he and the Duke of Devonshire seem about to use as fraudulent 
trustees for an alien purpose; in face also of the certain action of the mass of the Irish 
members, who have already destroyed the Liberal party, who have gone near to 
destroying the Parliamentary constitution of our country, and who now, in alliance 
with clerical Anglicans and all who hate the growth of education, bid fair to destroy 
the system of public school management which was slowly making its way in the 
country and was fatal to their exclusive claims. So dangerous a conspiracy against 
freedom and light may win, but not, it is hoped, till every true Liberal has fought 
his utmost in opposition, and not without leaving an earnest and intense determina- 
tion to keep on rousing the nation till they shall realize what it means to leave to 
private and irresponsible hands the education of their children, which should be 
their first duty and under their direct control. 
There are some other points that need noticing in the bill, equally bad in principle, 
equally impractical in application, 
As to the rating of schools. Henceforward the rates on all schools are to be paid 
by the overseers in rural nonschool-board districts out of the union rate; in school- 
board districts from the school-board area. Thus, the inhabitants of a school-board 
parish will pay the rates for the benefit of the whole union. Tho nonschool-board 
parishes will have their school directly subsidized from the rates of the union, to 
which parishes having a board school will pay in addition to the rate on their own 
schools. At present voluntary schools are generally rated at nominal sums, but they 
will now get substantial aid from the ratepayers. This will certainly be an addi- 
tional reason why the ratepayers should be represented on the management. 
In London rates will continue to be paid on board schools and levied over the 
whole area of London; and similarly the whole area of London will pay the local 
rates on the church schools. No precaution is even taken that the schools whose 
rates are paid are held in trust for public education, or that rent is not received for 
bb = Ma 
There is another equally wild and wasteful proposal in section 26—that guardians 
may contribute to the expense of providing, enlarging, or maintaining a school if 
the expense has been iacurred wholly or partly on account of children sent froma 
workhouse or boarded out. If there is need of further school accommodation ina 
district where the workhouse is situate, whether from the closing of a workhouse 
school or from any other cause, a school board can be, and by law should be, formed, 
and the workhouse will be rated and the property in the parish will be rated. No 
doubt it might be well to make the poor-law union the area for school-board purposes, 
in which case the whole area benefiting would contribute.
-P-A-G-E-196
120 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
But this cause would enable guardians in a large town to pay for enlarging or 
building a school in some parish where they board out children. But a year after- 
wards the local committee may break up, the boarded-out children may be trans- 
ferred elsewhere, and yet the guardians may have permanently contributed to the 
enlargement of this school which they will no longer use. Or Dr. Barnado may 
swoop down and outbid the guardians and capture all the houses which they used 
to use; and so, too, they may lose the benefit of the-school to which they will have 
contributed. The further power for guardians to subscribe to the maintenance of 
such a school is also most objectionable, and raises at once the question of rate aid 
for the maintenance of privately managed schools. This clause, like nearly every 
clause in the Dill, is full of reckless legislation, drawn apparently by those who had 
one aim, and one only, in view—how to subsidize and prop up private schools, how 
to stop any further school boards, and suppress those that exist. 
In reference to the audit of yoluntary school accounts clause 5 provides at last for 
what has been long required. Security should also be taken, in accordance with the 
act of 1870, for full publicity of all school reports and aroun: The recent restric- 
tion on publicity introduced by the new code shows that the education department 
is ready to take away the right of access to these reports which now exists. More- 
over, in dealing with voluntary schools greater care will have to be taken to put 
down the yarious forms of fraud now practiced, and which, when the education 
department detects, it does not take any adequate steps to punish. Thus, receipts 
are sometimes given for more salary than has been received; to balance this a ficti- 
tious subscription is entered, and so the school gets credit for a larger subscription 
and so has defeated the restrictions of the 17s. 6d. limit. * * * 
The new county authority is to have the power to aid training colleges. Nothing 
is more deplorable than the way in which the education department ever since 1870 
has shirked the important duty of seeing that there was provided an adequate sup- 
ply of properly trained teachers to meet the enormous growth of our elementary 
schools. But the jealousy of denominational training colleges still stopped the way, 
and it is only quite recently that some slight addition has been made by means of 
day colleges associated with local university colleges. We want at least twice as 
much training college provision as we have now to get back even to the proportion 
of trained teachers that existed before 1870. But, in addition to certificated teach- 
ers, our schools are flooded with ex-pupil teachers and women over 18, of whom a 
very experienced inspector said that the only educational qualification which they 
certainly possessed was that of being over 18. 
What is needed is that the new authorities for higher education should be enabled 
not only to aid but to establish training colleges. Probably two or three county 
authorities should combine for this purpose, as a good college requires a sufficient 
number of students. Itis to be hoped that, when there are more opportunities of 
training, the course may be lengthened to threo years. 
Section 19 fixes the maximum national contribution in each school to elementary 
education in future. 
It may be noticed that this is slightly below what a good school should receive 
now, apart from any grant for specific subjects or for pupil teachers. 
Thus, no school started hereafter can get more than 20 shillings for senior scholars 
and 17 shillings for infant scholars. At present a good senior department easily gets 
from 21 to 22 or 23 shillings in the case of a department limited to upper standards, 
and many girls’ schools earn an additional shilling for needlework. No doubt it has 
been a bad thing to stimulate the teaching of a large number of subjects for the sake 
of special grants. Yet itis to be feared that this new limitation of the grant, espe- 
cially coupled with the new limit in school maintenance, will induce many school 
boards to set before them a lower type of teacher and of teaching as all that they 
can afford to secure. Anyone who has followed the policy of several even among 
the larger boards (it were invidious to name them in this article) could point to 
school boards where this regulation will distinctly lower the teaching. It will—to 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
THE ENGLISH EDUCATION BILL OF 1896. 121 
use the exulting phrase of a leading Roman Catholic—clip the wings and claws of 
the school boards; and the bill is meant todoso. * * * 
It is obvious that the working of section 3 along with section 19 must tend to put 
all schools, good or bad alike, on a dead level as far as regards Government grant, 
with this important reservation, that whereas the board schools from their superior 
efficiency have hitherto received more than the voluntary schools, henceforward the 
voluntary schools are to receive 4 shillings a head more than the board schools. 
The effect of the two clauses together will be that in a town like Birmingham the 
superior efficiency of the board schools hitherto will have obtained a credit for the 
town with the education department, whereby, while the grants to the board schools 
will be cut down, the grants to the voluntary schools will be largely augmented. 
As to the repeal of the 17 shillings and 6 pence limit, it need only be repeated that 
if no new obligation to find some definite proportion of the cost from bona fide vol- 
untary contributions be introduced, we shall rapidly pass to a state of things where, 
in many parishes the community will find all the money, parents of all opinion 
will be forced to send their children, and the clergy of one denomination will have 
the whole management. 
Section 27: This section introduces a serious innovation. School boards must make 
reasonable arrangements for any kind of dogmatic teashing in their schools and so 
must other managers. The education department is sole judge of what is reason- 
able. May that department rule that the appointment of teachers of the religious 
opinion to be taught and the requiring them to give the instruction is reasonable, 
or must the teaching necessarily be given by outsiders? If the latter, there might 
not be much objection to the arrangement if it were part of a scheme that provided 
universally for schools under public local management, but what is wanted is not 
to break up the school into a group of conventicles, but to secure that the local 
majority of parents shall obtain teachers and management which have their confi- 
dence. There are many rural parishes where the majority of the children attending 
the church school are Dissenters, and yet in such a school the clergyman may adyver- 
tise for and require a strong churchman, a fasting communicant, one who will attend 
the daily service. 
The advertisements that appear in the Church scholastic newspaper are most exact- 
ing in their requirements, and often the reticence of the advertisement is supple- 
mented by searching private inquiries. The Roman Catholic says that in his school 
he requires the whole atmosphere throughout the school time to be penetrated with 
Catholicism. Schools for minorities such as the Roman Catholics are nearly always 
in populous centers and supplement the general schools of the nation. But what 
should be demanded is that the nation should come first and the sects should take 
the second place. Let us enfranchise the schoolmaster and the school by making 
them the public servants of a wide local community, not the dependents of the 
clergy of any one denomination, with ecclesiastical duties first in the estimation 
of their clerical employer, while their public and lay usefulness takes the second 
ACOs ce ee 
The writer is well assured that never have proposals been made more thoroughly 
reactionary, more hostile to education and to public self-government, more favorable 
to private, autocratic, and clerical domination than those which pervade this bill. 
The trifling proposal to raise the age of half-time exemption from 11 to 12 was one 
which all parties were agreed to last year, and which can not be taken as a conces- 
sion to bribe us to agree to the body of the Dill. 
As to what concerns secondary education, the proposals are obscure, indefinite 
and imperfect. The great question of secondary education should be treated ina 
separate act, and not mixed up with the intensely polemical matters which form the 
bulk of the bill now under consideration. 
If the English working people allow themselves to be robbed of the national 
system which was slowly establishing itself among them, and was doing so much 
for their children, they will put back for years the date of their full intellectual and 
social enfranchisement.

24 endowed schools, and 19 private schools) have submitted to the 
scheme of Government inspection. The number presenting candidates

land, a public examining body, reports 7,682 students (5,816 boys and 
1,866 girls) as coming up for examination in 1894. 
THE ENGLISH SYSTEM. 
At the present time the educational system of England may be thus 
briefly outlined: 
(1) School boards haye jurisdiction over nearly 20,000,000 of the population of 
England and Wales, and school attendance committees over 10,000,000. The former 
bodies have power to provide school accommodation where there is a deficiency of 
seats in their district, while the powers of the latter are limited entirely to the 
administration of the law as to children’s labor and school attendance. 
(2) The voluntary managers have provided and maintained three-fifths of the 
elementary school accommodation of the country. 
(3) While the school boards have power to build and maintain their schools on 
the security of their local rates, the voluntary schools rely on their endowments and 
subscriptions for such building and maintenance. 
(4) While in the voluntary schools religious teaching in accordance with the dis- 
tinctive doctrines of the denominations which established them may be given, at 
regulated times and subject to the right of withdrawal of all children whose parents 
do not desire it for them, in a school board school no religious teaching or religious 
formulary which is distinctive of a particular denomination may be given. 
(5) The grants last year amounted in day schools to £4,137,713 ($20,688,565). The 
average expenditure per scholar is slightly over £2 ($10); in board schools it is 
£2 10s. ($12.50), and the average rate of grant per head toward this expenditure is 
18s. 6d. ($4,625). 
The following detailed tables, relating to England and Wales, are 
reproduced, with explanatory comments, from the Schoolmaster of

In connection with class subjects, it will be seen from the next table that while 
English is gradually being discarded, elementary science and history are increasing 
in favor. Geography, too, shows slight signs of a growing popularity. Needle- 
work as a class subject does not vary much. Probably in a few years’ time, when

TABLE 4.—Comparative view of free vs. paying pupils. 
The figures for this year show that although the rate of increase is not so rapid as 
in the years immediately following the passage of the law for the remission of fees 
(1891), still the time is not distant when few children in primary schools will pay 
fees, and where fees are paid it is noticeable that the majority pay a penny per week 
orless. Not one child in one hundred and fifty pays more than 1 penny per week, 
But this growth of free education can easily be seen from the table.

  TABLE 5.—Effects of the law for the remission of fees. 
In looking at the increase in our school population, it is well to examine how far 
the almost entire abolition of fees has affected the attendance. We notice, as the 
next table will indicate, that there has been an increase in the percentage of attend- 
ance, and also in number of children who attend school after reaching the age of 
10. This year, however, does not show any very great strides in either direction, 
It must not be overlooked, though, that an increase in percentage of attendance of 
one-tenth means an additional 5,000 children.

Prior to 1876 the amount of the Government grant to a school could not exceed the 
amount raised locally. The law passed that year provided that the grant might exceed 
the local income but should not be more than 17s. 6d. per capita without correspond- 
ing increase in the local funds. In view of the proposal to abolish this limit it has 
been declared that voluntary subscriptions declined as a consequence of the liberal 
Government provisions of 1876. The following table shows in fact that a reduction 
in the per capita of voluntary subscriptions did follow that change:

On the vote for £4,162,232 ($20,811,160) to complete the sum of 
£7,122,213 ($35,611,065) necessary for public elementary education in 
England and Wales, including the expenses of the education office in 
London, Sir J. Gorst (Cambridge University) said: 
THE INCREASED ESTIMATE AND THE REASONS FOR IT.   
The expenditure during the past year exceeded the expenditure of the year before 
by £275,000. It was greater than had been expected, and a supplementary estimate 
had to be taken to meet the excess. The increased expenditure was well spread over 
all the principal items. I do not know that there is anything in the increased 
expenditure to call for special mention, except that it indicates the continued 
progress of education in the country. There is an increase in the numbers on the 
books, an increase in the average attendance of those on the books, and an increase 
in the grants that the children earn. In the coming year we have only estimated 
for an increase of £186,000. That is partly due to the fact that the stimulus given 
to education by the act of 1891 is gradually becoming exhausted, and the progress 
in all parts of education, which still goes on, is the normal increase due to the 
increase in the population and the wealth of the country. This increase of £186,000 
is again spread over every item of expenditure. The cost of inspection has increased 
chiefly because the evening schools are just now making great progress, and because 
the new system of making two surprise visits a year, instead of the regular inspection 
ED 96 5  
-P-A-G-E-206
  130 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
formerly made. once a year, has increased the inspectors’ traveling expenses. The 
decrease of £3,645 in the charges for pensions which appears on the estimates is 
_ apparent and not real. In previous years £6,710 had to be provided in order to 
defray the temporary cost of the exchange from half-yearly to quarterly payments, 
and, so far from there being a diminution in the charge for pensions, there is really 
an increase of £3,065, and an increase in the number of pensions given of 129. 
Another cause of the increase in the expenditure is the increased payments which 
will have to be mado to school boards under the ninety-seventh section of the act of 
1870,! a section which was very much discussed in our education debates. The 
effect of that discussion was to reveal to some school boards rights to grants out of 
the consolidated fund, which they had previously overlooked. The consequence 
will be that every school board which is entitled to such a grant will make a demand 
for it, which we calculate will take £8,850, and even that may prove too smalla sum. 
INCREASE IN SCHOOL ATTENDANCE IN DAY AND NIGHT SCHOOLS. 
But the great increase in expenditure this year, as in other years, is due to the 
increase in the grants made to day scholars. The increase we anticipate this year is 
70,000 in average attendance, a penny increase in the rate of the grant earned, and 
an increase in the amount which has been charged on the consolidated fund for that 
purpose of £86,000. Since 1891, when the last education act was passed, the increase 
in average attendance is as follows: In 1891 the increase was only 0.86 per cent, the 
normal increase; in 1892 it sprang up to 3.22; in 1893, to 5.92; in 1894 it sank to 3.47: 
in 1895, to 2.3; and this year, we anticipate, to 2.2; so that, although the increase 
has become less rapid, it has not yet gone down to the normal rate of 1890. Then 
there is an increase in the fee grant of £48,500. There is also a satisfactory in- 
crease in the charges for evening schools. In 1893, when the evening school code 
was first introduced, there were 1,977 evening schools and 115,000 scholars. Now 
there are 3,421 evening schools and 270,000 scholars; so that, while the evening 
schools have doubled, the scholars have more than doubled. 
SCHOOLS FOR THE BLIND AND DEAF. 
The schools for the blind and deaf also show an increase. In 1895 there were 79 
schools certified with accommodations for 4,130 children, and there was an actual 
grant made that year out of the consolidated fund in respect of 3,148 children, 
This grant is 3 guineas a year for every deaf and dumb child receiving an elementary 
education, and an additional 2 guineas for every child who receives manual instruc- 
tion or industrial training. The whole of the 3,148 children in 1895 received the 
grant for elementary instruction, but only 1,934 obtained the grant for industrial 
training, so that the average grant per child that year was £3 8s. For the current 
year we estimate that the grant will be for 3,148 children, being an average of £3 
10s. 9d. per child. 
CONCERNING COOKERY AND LAUNDRY ‘WORK. 
Cooking and laundry instruction in the elementary schools is, on the whole, mak- 
ing satisfactory progress. The number of girls taught cookery in the past year was 
135,000, an increase of nearly 13,000 during the year. Looking to the fact that thero 
are more than half a million of girls attending elementary schools in England and 
Wales who are qualified to be taught cookery, it is evident that there is considerable 
room for expansion in the teaching of that subject, and it is to be hoped that the 
progress will go on with accelerated rapidity in the years to come. The teaching of . 
laundry work in the elementary schools has only gone on for four or five years. In 
the last year the advance in the number of girls to whom grants were made was very 
extraordinary. It was 62 per cent over the number in the year before. In 1891, 
1 Providing for special aid in exceptional cases.
-P-A-G-E-207
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 131 
when the grant for laundry work was first made, the number of girls was 632; in 
1892 it was 2,766; in 1893 it was 5,640; in 1894 it was 7,388, and in 1895 it was 11,720; 
so that the teaching of laundry work is only beginning. It has already made such 
progress that we may anticipate a great increase in the number of girls taught in 
the course of the next few years. 
THE SUPPLY AND TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
I do not think that, in regard to the supply of teachers, we are making that prog- 
ress we all desire. There will be in the present year an increase of £36,000 for 
training colleges. But this increase is really only an apparent increase. Thereisa 
temporary reduction in the estimate for 1895-96 owing to the change in the academical 
year from December 31 to June 30, and therefore the increase in the grant to training 
colleges is apparent only, and not real. I wish we could see our way to a very great 
increase in the expenditure upon the training of teachers. At present there are 43 
residential colleges, and these are attended by 1,384 men and 2,100 women. Besides 
these, there are 14 day training colleges, attended by 385 men and 426 women. Tak- 
ing these colleges together, the whole number of teachers they had in training was 
4,296, and they turned out annually teachers who are qualified to take charge of 
schools to the number of about 2,100. This number is quite insufficient to meet the 
requirements of the existing schools, and if the wishes of the Government were car- 
ried out, and the education in all the voluntary schools of the country and the poor 
board schools made more efficient, the number of teachers turned out would be 
lamentably deficient. 
THE INTRODUCTION OF THE UNQUALIFIED PRACTITIONER. 
L have no doubt that in the course of the discussion upon this vote I shall be taken 
to task by honorable members, perhaps on both sides of the House, for the failure 
of the provisions of the code to secure that every teacher is a properly qualified 
teacher. I will not anticipate my answer to those objections further than to say 
that we could not get properly certificated and qualified teachers, and that we had to 
take those we could get. It is most desirable that some provision should be made 
early to secure a very much greater increase in the number of efficient teachers for 
our schools, especially if we are to make some progress in the efficiency of our ele- 
mentary education. I may be told that the account I have given to the committee 
is a very sanguine one, but the committee must recollect that I have been talking 
only of the averages, of the result of the summing up of the educational proceedings 
of all the schools in England and Wales. And when you look at it in the aggregate 
it is a very satisfactory progress, and one for which we have reason to be thankful. 
But this does not in the least contradict what I stated to the House in the early 
days of the session, and it would be avery great mistake if the committee were to 
Tun away with the idea that because things in the gross are very satisfactory there 
is therefore no room for any reform in large classes of schools in this country. 
  INEFFICIENT BOARDS OF MANAGEMENT. 
Notwithstanding this excellent total, there are many schools in the country, both 
board and voluntary schools, in which it is impossible to say that the education is 
efficient or satisfactory. There are voluntary school managers who have not got the 
means to provide that standard of teaching which it is desirable should be secured for 
the children of the people; there are managers of voluntary schools in many of our 
great cities who are quite unable, from lack of means, to bring up the standard of 
~ teaching in their schools to the same leyel which is attained in the board schools in their 
immediate neighborhood, and which haye the advantage of support out of the rates. 
And there are many school boards, some in country districts, where they care very lit- 
tle for education, and whero the conduct of their small village schools is exceedingly 
unsatisfactory and leaves very much to be desired. There are also many school boards

in large and populous centers who have efficient schools and who do their utmost to 
keep their schools efficient, but who, owing to the small ratable value of their areas 
as compared with the enormous number of children they have to educate, have a strain 
put upon them which is almost intolerable, and under which there is every proba- 
bility that, unless Parliament does something to relieve it, they will be entirely 
broken down. 
TIMELY WARNING—‘‘OUR RIVALS IN FRANCE AND GERMANY AND THE STATES.” 
Therefore I hope the committee will not go away with any idea that in what Ihave 
now said J intend to unsay what I said in the earlier part of the session as to the 
urgent necessity which we are under if we intend our education to advance and if 
we wish to give to the children an education anything like that which is being given 
by our rivals in France and Germany and the States. If we mean to keep to the 
general level and not to fall behind the general level of education which is now 
given in the civilized world, I solemnly warn the committee that there is a great 
deal to be done, and a great deal that administration alone can not do. The wis- 
dom of Parliament must be applied to this problem, and I wish I could think it 
could be applied not in a party spirit, but with a sincere desire, in all quarters of 
the House, to promote education. 
THE STATE AND RURAL EDUCATION. 
Mr. YOXALL congratulated the vice-president upon the tone of his remarks, and 
echoed his aspiration that this question of education would be treated in future 
not as a party, but as a national, question. He quite agreed that there were many 
schools in the country, both voluntary and board schools, which sadly required the 
provision of further funds. But he wanted to say a few words more, especially upon. 
the position of rural schools. He did not care very much whether they were rural 
board or rural voluntary schools—they were much in the same class—and he would 
point out that the rural schools of England and Wales were, taken as a whole, the 
worst supported, the worst staffed, and the worst managed of the public elementary 
schools in Europe. They lacked means, they lacked teachers, and they lacked 
proper government and proper supervision. It was quite a common thing—and this 
was probably true of 6,000 or 7,000 schools in the villages of this country—to find in 
aschool one adult teacher only with the éharge of six and sometimes seven different 
classes, and teaching in something like sixteen or seventeen different subjects. 
That was a system which was bad educationally, bad nationally, and bad econom- 
ically. The great need of the country schools was more staff; but he warned the 
committee, and he would warn the vice-president if he thought he needed the warn- 
ing, that they could not expect these schools to have more staff and better support 
upon a maximum income in the case of voluntary schools of 33 shillings per scholar 
per year and in the case of board schools of 49 shillings. If the education depart- 
ment were to realize the wishes of the vice-president, if the committee were to 
assent to continued, to real progress in their educational affairs, the committee 
would have to vote a very much larger outlay upon education than had been the case 
hitherto, 
EXPENDITURES ON EDUCATION. 
The demand for further expenditure upon education was not a popular idea to put 
forward, but he would point out that this year they were spending upon the army 
and navy at the rate of 30 shillings per head of the population, while upon educa- 
tion they were only spending at the rate of 7 shillings per head. ‘Thirty shil- 
lings on ships and sailors; 7 shillings on schools and scholars! He submitted that 
Tshillings per head of the population upon public education was not an extravagant 
outlay. In other countries they did not consider that outlay at all sufficient. The 
average expenditure upon maintenance of board schools in England and Wales last 
year was 48s. 9d, per child. In the case of yoluntary schools it was 36s. 1d, per child,”
-P-A-G-E-209
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 133 
Tn Scotland they spent more than that, while in Germany, France, Belgium, and 
Switzerland their rates of expenditure were also higher. In the United States, too, 
they found that after allowing for all differences between the cost of maintenance 
in the two countries, the sums expended on education were far in excess of what 
they spent here. Whereas the expenditure in London per child for public educa- 
tion might go up as far as 50 shillings, in New York it went up as high as £5 per 
child, and in Boston it went up even higher. He did not suggest that they should 
at one leap go so far as that; but he did suggest it was the duty of the House and 
of the education department not to stint the expenditure year by year. The expen- 
diture of money on public elementary and secondary education, but especially ele- 
mentary education, was a good national investment. The effect of the working of 
the education acts in the last twenty-five years had been to decrease pauperism, and 
to deplete the gaols, and to raze prisons to the ground, and to reduce the amount of 
drunkenness. A board school scholar cost the country 48 shillings a year, a pauper 
cost £15 a year, an ordinary prisoner cost £25 a year, and a convict cost £40 a year. 
So the money spent on education was well spent. 
THE FOOTNOTE TO ARTICLE 73. 
He wished to thank the vice-president of the council for giving effect to several 
promises made last year. He referred especially to the questions of teachers not 
trained in the colleges and the system of teaching and inspecting drawing. But he 
was sorry that the department had acceded to the suggestion to suspend article 73 
of the code until March 31 next. That article provided that after August 31 in the 
present year the size of the classes in the elementary schools should be reduced in 
number, Even in the largest and best board schools it was no uncommon thing 
to find classes of 80, 90, and 100 children, and no teacher could efficiently teach - 
so large a class. It was possible to have larger classes than the code permitted, 
because the classes were not examined in detail, but the number of children in the 
school was divided by the number of teachers. The right honorable member for 
Rotherham had given two years’ notice of the requirement in respect of smaller 
classes, and it was greatly to be regretted that the operation of the requirement 
had been postponed. When the class was too large the scholars lacked individual 
attention, and consequently their school life was wasted. In the grammar schools 
the average number in the class was from 15 to 20, and in a girls’ high school the 
average was from 15 to 30. There was, besides, no need for the suspension of the 
requirement. The Bishop of London had declared that 90 out of 100 voluntary 
schools in the country could meet the increased requirements without difficulty, 
THE UNQUALIFIED PRACTITIONER. 
As to the failure of the supply of fully qualified teachers, every year there were 
four times as many applications for admission to the training colleges as there were 
vacancies. The fault was that there were not enough properly established training 
colleges. The supply of teachers depended on local enterprise and denominational 
initiative. If there was a failure in the supply of pupil teachers, it was because the 
education department did not make the career sufficiently attractive. Something 
could be done under article 68 of the code which enabled a young woman without 
qualification, but with the inspector’s approval, to teach in the school. These girls 
belong to two categories—those who had failed to pass the pupil teachers’ examina- 
tion and those who had not eyen had that training. At first their employment was 
narrowly restricted, but now they were to be allowed to teach even in boys’ schools. 
Out of 92,570 adult teachers in schools, 66,310 were women, and out of 34,000 pupil 
teachers 26,000 were girls. It looked as though the men were to be thrust out of 
the profession altogether, and no doubt in many circumstances petticoat govern- 
ment was not a bad thing for children. But there came a time in a boy’s school life 
when he wanted something more, and therefore he hoped that the department would
-P-A-G-E-210
  134 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
not assist further the tendency to replace men teachers by women. The department 
was so anxious to get graduates of Oxford and Cambridge into the elementary schools 
that now they were permitted to accept head masterships without any previous train- 
ing. Against this policy of introducing untrained and unqualified men into the 
most responsible positions he must protest. However high a man’s academic attain- 
ments, he might be a complete failure when put in charge of large classes and when 
required to teach them. 
THE RELATIONS BETW: 
  BN THE STATE AND THE TEACHER. 
He wished to say a few words as to the whole attitude of the department toward 
its teachers. The treatment of the teachers by the department, not in detail but in 
principle, was wholly wrong; it was shortsighted, out of harmony with the usual 
practice of Government departments, and rather cruel. Down to 1862 the depart- 
ment took direct responsibility with regard to teachers; it recognized them and 
treated them as civil servants. Since 1862 the department had disclaimed all 
responsibility; it had said that it was no party to the engagement of a teacher; it 
refused to be a court of appeal or even a moderator in regard to dismissals; it 
shuffled off all responsibility. It tested the teacher and certificated him; it dis- 
missed him from a post for which he was not qualified; it took a great deal of care 
that he performed the functions assigned to him, but it declined, though it had 
‘often been asked to do it, to see that the salary paid to him was sufficient. It 
shuffled off the responsibility for that onto a board or committee, which was in the 
position of a contractor with the State. In other cases the Government took care 
that contractors did their work well, paid their employees properly, and treated them 
in a proper way; it secured fair play to the workers; it repudiated this responsibil- 
ity only in the case of teachers in their relations with school managers and school 
boards. It insisted on certain conditions as to fair wages, proper hours, and suit- 
able management in shipbuilding yards, in army clothing factories, in printing 
works, and as to their carpenters employed at South Kensington. The local gov- 
ernment board took interest in the officials and employees of the boards of guardians, 
THE TEACHER’S PAY. 
If a board of guardians appointed a medical officer at an insufficient salary, the 
local government board said, ‘‘ You must pay him more.” The education department 
never did that kind of thing. Why should it not do so? If it did, the present 
lamentable state of things as to teachers would not exist. There are 50,836 certifi- 
cated teachers. There were 435 who had salaries of under £40 a year, or less than 16 
shillings a week; 1,342 at under £45 a year, or less than 18 shillings a week; 2,666 
at under £50 a year, or less than 20 shillings a week; 18,395 at salaries under £75 a 
year, or less than 29 shillings a week, and only 2,397 who got salaries of £200 a year 
and over. This state of things could not exist if the Government dealt with school 
managers as it dealt with other contractors and saw that they fulfilled their con- 
tracts; and he had a right to ask that the attitude of the education department 
toward school managers and teachers should be radically changed. 
TENURE AND EXTRANEOUS TASKS. 
These contractors exacted from teachers tasks which did not properly belong to 
them—the performance of extraneous duties in connection with church and parochial 
work; and it was the duty of the department to secure teachers against these exac- 
tions and impositions. Then managers could dismiss teachers without just cause, 
and for the teacher there was no remedy. If a question was asked in that House 
about a wrongful dismissal the vice-president would reply, ‘‘We have no power to 
interfere.” Well, it was high timo they had power to interfere. The teachers were 
as much entitled to protection as carpenters at South Kensington or tailors in army  
-P-A-G-E-211

clothing works. Why should the education department decline to take steps to 
safeguard the interests of teachers when the House had determined that it would 
secure the payment of fair wages under Government contracts? They could do it 
by simply inserting in the code conditions as to the payment of grants. They could 
Jay down that grants should be withheld where salaries were not suitable and 
sufficient, where extraneous tasks were compulsory, and where unreasonable and 
capricious dismissals had taken place. This view might seem to be new at present, 
but as time went on it would cease to be new. The education department would 
have to yield on these points as other departments had yielded on the labor question. 
THE SUPERANNUATION QUESTION. 
In other departments public servants who were in direct relation with the Goverr- 
ment received superannuation allowances or pensions, but in the case of the teachers 
there was only the most meager provision for a limited number. Eleven months had 
passed since the last debate, when a favorable statement was made, but nothing had 
been done to realize it. Still the bulk. of aged and infirm teachers had nothing to 
look forward to but charity or the workhouse. That meant a waste of educational 
resources. The teacher past work still “lags superfluous on the stage,” and that 
involved a waste of money and of the time of the scholars. The State did not get 
what it supposed it was paying for, and thus the question became an economical one 
as well as a sentimental one. But even the sentiment ought to have some weight, 
for here you had men and women who had worked out their lives for a mere pittance; 
they had done valuable work, contributing to diminish pauperism and drunkenness 
and to empty prisons, and their reward was that some of them got pensions of £25 
a year, and the bulk of them had not even that prospect. The teachers had inti- 
mated their willingness to accept the minimum scale of allowances proposed by the 
department; less than was proposed by the select committee, less than was given in 
tho civil service, less than the police scale, and less than the county council scale; 
but this minimum, so accepted, was still withheld. Why, he did not know. The 
sum required was from £30,000 to £35,000 a year, and in the first five years it would 
not be over £100,000. Hedid hope the right honorable gentleman would be able to 
hold out a hope that something would be done. Ho believed that money ought to be 
given to voluntary schools, but when it was given it ought to be on condition that 
the full benefit of the extra grant should go to the underpaid teachers. [School- 
master, July 18, 1896.]

138 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
PuBLIC INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN BERLIN. 
When the old Trade Institute of the city of Berlin was changed into 
an industrial academy, and later was transformed: into what is now 
known as the Polytechnicum of Charlottenburg, there became apparent 
a gap between the public elementary school work and the technological 
education, as well as a gap between school and practical life. It has 
always been well understood in Germany, that the education supported 
by the State and general taxation must not be special education, but 
-aim at general culture. In other words, public education can not pre- 
pare for any particular profession, vocation, or occupation; it is intended 
to lay the foundation for a general culture desirable for all citizens of 
the State. While thus any special preparation for the trades, or for 
commerce, or for the higher professions is excluded from institutions 
that offer education gratuitously, on the other hand there has arisen a 
difficulty which makes the establishment of trade and industrial schools 
a necessity. The labor unions, prompted by self-interest, frequently 
prohibit their members from engaging apprentices; naturally then their 
number is very small, hence very few chances are offered for the learn- 
ing of trades. The great extension of mechanical contrivances and 
machines of all kinds has liberated much human power that was for- 
merly engaged in mere mechanical performances. Hence the labor of 
the hand has become much more complicated, much more difficult to 
learn, and, therefore, also needs much more careful study and exercise. 
All these causes combine to necessitate the establishment of a number 
of special schools, and the city government of Berlin, fully aware of the 
changed conditions of labor, liberally provided for them. But it must 
be well understood that all the trade schools and institutions for the 
preparation of skilled laborers in Germany have this one characteristic 
feature, to wit, that they bestow less attention upon manual labor and 
more to the underlying principles and the knowledge skilled labor pre- 
supposes. This is the reason why drawing, mathematics, the sciences 
of physics and chemistry, and the like are taught in trade schools. 
The shop work, so often spoken of, and held up as models of imitation 
in this country, is comparatively very limited and confines itself to 
mere application of principles-learned during lessons. It seems as 
though these German trade schools carefully abstain from coming into 
competition with the labor market. 
A recent report of the superintendent of public schools in Berlin, 
privy councillor, Dr. Bertram, states that the sum of 542,445 marks was 
spent in the year 1895. Of this sum 86,159 marks were contributed by 
the State of Prussia; 325,401 marks by the community; 16,565 marks 
by trade unions, societies, mercantile firms, etc., and the board of trade 
contributed 4,000 marks; while 110,320 marks, or about one-fifth of the 
sum total, were paid in the form of tuition fees. To this sum total of 
542,445 marks ($129,102) must be added various donations in form of  
-P-A-G-E-215
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. . 139 
tools and other things, such as material, for which no correct estimate 
can be made. While this-money is spent entirely in the interest of 
schools preparing for skilled labor, there must be mentioned also the 
fact that 337,560 marks ($80,339) is expended by the city for so-called 
“eontinuation or supplementary schools,” in which industrial education 
is a very essential feature. These latter-named schools offer post- 
graduate instruction to boys and girls who have gone through the 
eight years’ course of the elementary school. Most of these supple- 
mentary. schools offer gratuitous instruction, but not all... Though 
Berlin is a metropolis of large size, it seems remarkable that it should 
pay about $200,000 per year for purely industrial education. 
How this sum is distributed, and for what purposes it is used, can 
be seen from the following statements taken from Dr. Bertram’s report. 
The great variety of trade institutions and their scope appear to cover 
up the fundamental idea, but careful observation reveals it. It is this: 
The city authorities desire to give young men of aspiration who are 
desirous of gaining knowledge, as well as persons of more advanced 
age, opportunities for the development of their special talents and 
skill that can not, in the nature of the case, be found in the workshop 
or the factory. 
It is the desire of all concerned in this department of education that 
the student should not engage in actual practical work for pay, and to 
put the instruction in close contact with the circumstances or occupa- 
tions of the learners. Moreover, and this appears to us here in Amer- 
ica the more important and nobler object of the schools, the entire 
range of instruction in these trade and industrial schools tends to 
unify several branches of labor and te prevent too much specialization. 
Apprentices and young beginners are very apt in our modern time of 
application of machines to learn to work mechanically. Specialization 
is going so far that the workman is often degraded to an assistant of 
the machine, instead of the machine being his assistant. A few grips, 
a few touches, a few motions, are all the man has to do, and he loses 
his respect for the dignity of labor and can not see all the bearings of 
a single trade. These industrial schools lift the young man to a higher _ 
standpoint, from which he can view all the bearings of his trade and its 
organic combination with other trades, 
In accordance with this central idea the choice of courses of instruc- ~ 
tion is left free to the student, and a systematic, rigid course of study is : 
introduced only in eases where experience has proven incontestably in 
certain trades that such a course is profitable. The authorities also 
desire to interest and solicit the active sympathy ef trades unions, 
societies, and experts, by offering for every trade that kind of instrue- 
tion which is apt to supplement its practical application by theory. The 
eminent success of the royal art schools and industrial museums is ~ 
utilized by employing the graduates of these institutions as teachers in 
1 Compare article on such schools in last year’s annual report.
-P-A-G-E-216
  140 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
the trade schools, for it is argued that a teacher should know very much 
more than he is to teach. Hence mere artisans can not be teachers in 
Berlin trade schools. The authorities insist upon their being graduates 
of schools of design and other art schools. The system of industrial 
education of Berlin, it is admitted, is not entirely developed, and some 
of the schools belonging to the system are still in their infancy; but in 
the main features the course of education for young tradesmen and 
skilled artisans is designed to be as follows: 
First, it must be remarked that the course of education sketched in 
the following lines is designed for boys, because trades and industrial 
fields in Germany ave, as a rule, not crowded with women. Every boy, 
then, may attend a public elementary school, the so-called people’s 
school, which offers instruction gratuitously. If he and his parents 
conclude to aim at a higher education than the elementary schools offer, 
he may enter one of the twelve higher burger schools in Berlin, called 
Realschulen, which are so organized that a boy coming from the elemen- 
tary schools at the age of 12 years may at once enter the fourth grade, 
above which instruction in foreign languages begins. These schools 
admit pupils at 10 years of age, butin the first two years the chief 
work consists of language (mother tongue), history, a little of the science 
of physics, and geometry. These high schools are of course without 
Latin. The graduates of these institutions receive the privilege of only 
one year’s army service. 
Boys of the elementary school who enter these higher schools at the 
age of 12, and cannot’ pay for their tuition, receive their instruction 
gratuitously. Boys who at the age of 14 leave the elementary school 
or are dropped out of the Realschulen owing to poverty, find oppor- 
tunity for continuing their studies in the evening or on Sundays in so- 
ealled supplementary or continuation schools. Here the mother tongue, 
arithmetic, geometry, physics, and some other branches are taught 
gratuitously. Some of these continuation schools also teach higher 
branches, such as foreign languages and double-entry bookkeeping; for 
these higher branches a small tuition fee is to be paid. 
And now we come to the purely industrial institutions: (1) The two 
* trade schools of the city. The older of the two began in October, 1880. 
It was called into existence by the city authorities with the active 
cooperation of the State. From the moment that the new principal, 
‘Professor Jessen, was called from Hamburg to take charge of this first 
trade school in Berlin the latter has increased in extent and importance 
beyond everything that even the most extravagant expectations could 
have imagined—enrolling 2,193 students in 1894-95, The other schoolis 
almost a copy of the first, following in all essentials the plan evolved 
by experience in the first trade school. Professor Bertram describes it 
as follows: 
The original plan intended to give persons beyond the age of compulsory educa- 
tion, and who have completed the work of the elementary school, instruction in 
industrial drawing and modeling, in arithmetic, mechanics and physics, and, lastly,
-P-A-G-E-217
  / 
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 141 
in bookkeeping and arithmetic. The school was intended to accommodate 600 stu- 
dents; the expenditure, aside from the tuition fee charged, was estimated at 30,000 
marks per annum, of which the State intended to pay one-half. At present (in 1895) 
the State pays 20,000 marks and the city 100,000 marks. The school fully lives up 
to the original plan, but it has extended its field of usefulness so much that it isa 
source of pride to the industrial world of the German Empire. To prove this it may 
be mentioned that in the courses for mechanical drawing it prepares its students for 
the work of a great number of trades, such as watchmakers, stone masons, and the 
like. In day classes it prepares fresco painters. Students of these classes come 
only in winter, and they come to Berlin for this particular purpose from all over 
the Empire. Similar classes prepare cabinetmakers, wood engravers, etc. The 
school has lately opened day classes for mechanical engineers, and likewise for 
electro-technical work, Among the students there are found masters, journeymen, 
laborers, drawing teachers, side by side with students who are just beginning to 
prepare themselves for a trade, 
This Berlin Trade School is a nursery of special schools, the first beginnings of 
which are found within its walls; thus, for instance, we find the typographical school 
started here; but, above all, it is a nursery of modern methods of teaching. This, 
indeed, is its most characteristic feature, and we may describe it by stating it to be 
an experimental station for teaching trades. 
     
In order to relieve the school of its overcrowded classes a second 
trade school was established in October, 1892, This second school had 
already in 1895 a total of 850 students. This school follows the first 
in all essentials except in physics, which science is excluded owing to 
want of suitable rooms; instead of that it has a day class for painters, 
and has lately opened also a class for artistic metal and. brazier work. 
Drawing of metal and conventionalized floral designs is a peculiar fea- 
ture of this school. 
The builders’ school, representing all the trades engaged in the erec- 
tion of buildings, is formed according to the model prescribed by the 
Prussian State authorities, and it is, like the two trade schools, sup- 
ported by the State and the community jointly. It has 381 students 
in four succeeding yearly classes. 
The weaving school in Berlin was formerly intended only as a special 
school for apprentices and journeymen in the textile industry, in order 
to give them an opportunity to go from one department to another 
without going through the otherwise necessary period of apprentice- 
ship. But the school has greatly extended its usefulness by attempting 
to represent, and, as it were, foreshadow, the frequently changing fash- 
ions in the branch of textile industry. This school, like all other trade 
and industrial schools in Berlin, constantly keeps this leading idea in 
mind, namely, every workman should know more, and should be able 
to do more, than one thing. It is not only desirable but in the nature 
of the case necessary for him to know many branches of his trade. If 
he be a weaver in silk he should know the tricks of the trade of the 
linen weaver, or the cotton weaver, or the woolen weaver; and thesame 
holds good in other cases. The instruction extends over hand looms, 
mechanical looms, and work in passementerie. The possibility of offer- 
ing to Sunday and evening school students so fine an equipment in

apparatus and means of instruction dates from the year 1889, when, 
in addition to these courses, day classes were opened which, according 
to the present terminology, are called the higher weaving school. The 
two divisions are supplemented by an evening school for merchants of 
the textile branch; and lately the beginning of a school for dyers has 
been made. The organization of all Prussian weaving schools is oceu- 
pying the secretary of the department of commerce and industry, and 
his object is to make them more uniform than they are at present. 
Tuition fees are not required of apprentices and workmen in the textile 
industry. Two other institutions must be mentioned which are prob- 
ably characteristic of the city of Berlin. They are the cabinetmaker’s 
school and what is known as the Industrial Hall. 
In the continuation of supplementary schools it was noticed that 
mechanical drawing engaged the attention of a large number of young 
. people in preparation for certain branches of instruction closely allied 
with and forming the basis of trade and industrial education. Indeed, 
this special kind of drawing, the so-called drawing of working models, 
seems to be the backbone of instruction offered in the continuation 
schools. The further this system of schools developed, and the more 
the number of pupils increased, the more desirable became professional 
supervision and technical instruction in the industrial features of draw- 
ing; and to meet this demand it was deemed appropriate to establish 
what is known as the Industrial Hall. The courses of technical draw- 
ing arranged for locksmiths and artistic metal workers, machine build- 
ers, tinsmiths, instrument makers, etc., remained where they had been 
given, but in the Central Industrial Hall all branches of industry were 
united in one and taught by a specially and well-qualified group of 
teachers. At the head of this institution was placed a very skillful 
man who had, through long years of experience in the trades school, 
proved to be particularly well fitted for this position. He is the super- 
visor of technical mechanical drawing courses; he selects proper teach- 
ers and determines the method and means of instruction, so that now 
the city authority has some guaranty that the various industrial courses 
are appropriately prepared for by the instruction given in drawing. 
The Industrial Hall has ten subdepartments distributed over the vari- 
ous parts of the city. This is to enable the students in all parts of the 
city to participate in the instruction, so that everyone finds instruc- 
tion near his home. These courses are offered in the evening and on 
Sundays. The drawing does not confine itself to technical and pro- 
fessional drawing only, but includes projective drawing and mechanics. 
The authorities entertain the hope that this instruction in drawing 
which centers in the Industrial Hall, and which was participated in 
during the winter of 1895 by 1,400 students, may in future time change 
into a day school for machine builders. 
A similar development has been noticed in the school of cabinet- 
makers. Cabinetmakers have great need for technical drawing, and
-P-A-G-E-219
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 143 
especially in designing new models; hence it was desirable to establish 
proper supervisors, so that the various courses offered in the city might 
be fostered and cared for uniformly. The city of Berlin has now a 
large number of drawing courses for cabinetmakers, altogether seven 
different departments in various parts of the city. The next step con- 
templated is to combine a school for turners with the cabinetmakers’ 
school. The Turners’ Union has expressed the desire that such a school 
be established, and it is the intention to connect it with an established 
school, especially since the two trades of cabinetmaking and turning 
are so closely allied. Woodcarving is carefully attended to in the 
cabinetmakers’ school, and not having the desired space, some of the 
apprentices of this school have occupied the upper halls of common 
schools, which, of course, in the nature of the case, can be utilized only 
in the evening. It may be of interest to remark that a successful trial 
has been made to change this cabinetmakers’ school into a day school, 
for many of the apprentices and sons of masters in that trade have 
been able to secure a release from work in their shops in order to attend 
the school for a certain number of days a week. But in all parts of 
the school, whether in the central school for cabinetmakers or in the 
various branch schools, it is drawing which forms the chief branch and 
mainstay of the course of instruction. 
Aside from the schools thus far mentioned, Berlin has 15 other special 
schools for trades, namely, for masons and carpenters, for painters, 
chimney sweeps, barbers, wheelwrights, glaziers, shoemakers, black- 
smiths, paper hangers and decorators, basket braiders, bookbinders, 
gardeners, printers, and tailors. The potters also have a school, but 
that is supported by the city only in so far as the city allows the use 
of certain available schoolrooms for its use. It is confidently hoped 
that this school will soon enter into closer relations with the city 
government, 
Most of these schools have originated in trades unions, or, if not that, 
they have been suggested and aided by the unions. In most of them 
drawing is greatly fostered, although some of them represent trades in 
which drawing is not essential, but which require only mannal dex- 
terity; thus, for instance, the barbers and hairdressers, whose trade 
is very extensive in the city of Berlin, and whose school is very numer- 
ously attended. Wheelwrights began with a small workshop for pupils. 
The bookbinders have gone much further, using rooms which were 
specially designed and erected for them, The same may be said of the 
basket braiders’ school. For such trades as bookbinding, basket braid- 
ing, and the like the necessity of maintaining a practice workshop is 
very urgent. In the bookbinders’ trade the division of labor has pro- 
gressed to such an extent that a number of apprentices can practice 
through their apprenticeship without ever having completely seen how 
a book is bound. This school shows all the various branches of the 
trade and enables the student to try his hand at all of them, so that 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  144 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
when he changes from one workshop to another in after life he may be 
able to change his occupation as necessity or the vicissitudes of life 
demand. There is scarcely a specialty in the trade that is not carefully 
and judiciously represented in the bookbinders’ school. 
Similar things may be said regarding the basket braiders. They 
have so-called common beaten work as well as fine artistic work; they 
also manufacture wicker and rattan-furniture. Hach master of a shop 
usually has a specialty, and hence apprentices in his shop would learn 
only that-specialty; but in a braiders’ school he learns all the many 
features of the trade. Other schools, like those of paper hangers and 
decorators, shoemakers, and tailors, show certain features of the trade 
and certain devices not commonly taught to apprentices in workshops- 
Thus, for instance, the students of tailoring and shoemaking are taught 
to use the cutting machine and to calculate mathematically the size 
of every part of the garment, one part being given. The authorities of 
Berlin noticed with satisfaction that the courses in garment cutting 
were attended by masters as well as by apprentices and journeymen. 
The house decorators’ school in Berlin is in a very prosperous con- 
dition, partly owing to the flourishing trade of paper hangers and fresco 
painters. Berlin since 1870 has grown more rapidly than many Ameri- 
can cities. Much building and remodeling of houses is going on, and 
the refined taste of the inhabitants of the capital seems to require the 
art of decorators more generally. Other trade schools need not be 
described; a mere mention will suffice. The gardeners’ school draws 
into its influence young gardeners from far and near. They chiefly 
study botany and drawing, make excursions with their teachers, and 
practice surveying and leveling, drainage, and other practical parts of 
landscape. gardening. 
Dr. Bertram, being asked, ‘‘What is the result of these various trade 
schools?” says: 
_ Ican not as yet give utterance to a definite opinion concerning the results, because 
this extensive system of industrial education has not existed long enough to have 
developed fruit; but I may confidently state, without apprehension of saying too 
much, that with the opportunities that were offered the eagerness to learn increased 
extraordinarily, which is a most hopeful indication of wholesome influence. I 
observe, secondly, that the opposition against trade schools, which used to be very 
strong among the masters, has almost died out, and that, thirdly, the usefulness of 
apprentices in workshops and factories is being recognized all over the city, because 
they can apply in actual work that which they learn theoretically in school. ; 
The real value of asystem of schools can not be estimated until its 
graduates have had time to prove to the world what they have learned, 
and how successfully they can apply their knowledge. That requires 
more time than many impatient people will concede. 
The authorities in Berlin entertain the hope that the further devel- 
opment of this system of trade schools. will aid the trades in one 
particular, to wit: The school teaches the construction and use of 
machines used in trades, and acquaints the student with various
-P-A-G-E-221
  
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 145 
motors, which will gradually lead to an extension of the tradesman’s 
business. The present extensive system of electrical motors enables 
a poor man to use mechanical power in his shop, and thus to compete 
with his wealthy rival. A connection between workshop and factory 
is established or made possible, since the factory owner will, it is 
evident, prefer men who have learned in actual contact with machines 
how to perform skillful manipulations. And whenever new inventions 
change the aspect of any trade, the men skilled in numerous phases of 
their work are apt to find occasion for their talents, while those who 
only understand the mechanical part are easily stranded.

In connection with the foregoing statement of what is done for indus- 
trial education in the city of Berlin, it is interesting to note an Ameri- 
ean opinion of industrial education in Germany, and its effect upon the 
success of that Empire in commerce and various domains of industry. 
The following quotation is an editorial article in the Scientific Ameri- 
can (September 26, 1896), which deserves great credit for shrewd obser- 
vation and candid statement. The article is headed “The secrets of 
Germany’s industrial success.” 
Perhaps the most notable fact in the industrial world just now is the commanding 
position which is being won by the German manufacturers and the rapid encroach- 
ments which they are making upon the foreign trade of other nations, and particu- 
larly upon that of Great Britain. In taking note of this development we must 
remember that it is nothing new—that it is not the result of a sudden outburst of
-P-A-G-E-222
146 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
energy. It is merely the larger development, the coming of age, of a system which 
has been steadily at work in Germany for many ycars. Her industrial triumph, 
which has come as a surprise to the world at large, and with a rude awakening 
shock to Great Britain in particular, is no surprise to the German people themselves. 
In school and college, in workshop and factory, by carefully planned organizations 
at home and abroad, they have set in motion a'system of industrial forces which are 
now working out the desired results with mechanical regularity and precision. 
The German mind is essentially scientific and methodical. It was these qualities 
that contributed largely to the signal triumph of the German arms in the memora- 
ble war of 1870. During the quarter of a century that has intervened since the close 
of the struggle and the consolidation of the Empire, Germany has been applying the 
same scientific methods to the arts of peace; and with such success that it begins to 
look as though her industrial armies were going to occupy the broad fields of inter- 
national commerce with the same resistless energy with which her battalions 
marched from Saarbriick to Sedan a quarter of a century ago. 
Germany owes her industrial success to her system of scientific training in schools 
and colleges, to the close fellowship which exists between her factories and her 
schools, and to her elaborate organizations for the control and development of com- 
merce. 
That the scientific course in German schools was thorough and effective has always 
been well understood; but it has been reserved for a private letter written by Pro- 
fessor Ostwald, the distinguished German chemist, to his English friend, Professor . 
Ramsay, to open the cyes of the world, and particularly of the English people, who 
are most nearly affected, to the practical use to which the scientific researches of 
their specialists are put by the German people. It appears from this letter that 
there is a close alliance between the German manufacturers and the universities and 
high-grade technical schools. In the chemical industry, for instance, it seems that 
splendid inducements are offered to the graduates of technical colleges to enter the 
laboratories which form part of the equipment of the factories. These young men 
are engaged, not for the executive work of the establishment, but for purely experi- 
- mental work in the laboratory. They form a brigade of skilled inventors, who 
devote themselves to the discovery of improved processes and methods of manu- 
facture 
Speaking of this system, Professor Ostwald says: 
“The research laboratory in such a work is only different from one in a university 
by its being more splendidly and sumptuously fitted than the latter. I have heard 
from the business managers of such works that they have not unfrequently men who 
have worked for four years without practical success; but if they know them to 
possess ability, they keep them notwithstanding, and in most cases w ith ultimate 
success sufficient to pay the expenses of the former resultless years.” 
When we bearin mind that “there are often more than one hundred Ph. D.’s in a 
single manufactory,” and that this little army of qualified scientists is occupied 
solely in “making inventions,” we begin to understand why it is that Germany is 
already preeminent in certain markets of the world, and is likely to become so in 
others before long. Invention is no longer left to the unaided efforts of the well- 
meaning but often uninstructed individual. In the special laboratory there will be 
no long hours of fruitless search for an object whose supposed existence is based 
upon ignorance of the first principles of physics or mechanics. In this admirable 
combination of the skilled theorist and the trained mechanic there is little left to 
chance, and the development of an art is carried on by the sure and logical process 
of experiment, invention, and design. 
Of scarcely less importance in German industrial economy is her elaborate system 
for the fostering and extension of trade. This includes the founding, in certain 
industrial centers, of chambers of commerce. These institutions are intended to deal 
with questions of home and foreign trade in the broadest possible manner.
-P-A-G-E-223
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 147 
“There is no question connected with the development of trade interests, of manu- 
factures, credit capacity of foreign countries, advantages to be obtained by treaty 
stipulations, injuries resulting from measures adopted by other nations in restraint 
of trade, which is not thoroughly discussed and carefully considered by the many 
German chambers of commerce scattered over the country. These bodies report to 
the minister of commerce with regard to the influence and bearing of allsuch matters, 
as they are connected with,the commercial interests of the various localities; and by 
petition or otherwise they often secure action through their minister and the minis- 
ter of foreign affairs which is of great advantage to them.” i 
As the necessary counterpart of this organization at home, the Germans are about 
to establish a system of commercial attachés, whoso agents shall be specially trained 
for the service and shall form a recognized part of tho national representation in 
foreign countries. The work of the attaché will be similar to that which is now 
embodied by our own consuls in their ‘‘consular reports,” many of which, be it said, 
are admirable documents and worthy of a wider circulation. He will furnish to the 
home government a statement in detail of the particular commodities which are 
required in his district, and will keep it informed of the volume and nature of the 
trade done there by competitors; and, indeed, he will report any facts which might 
bo of service for dissemination among the various local boards of trade above men- 
tioned, 
Visitors to the Columbian Exposition at Chicago will remember the truly magnifi- 
cent display that was made by Germany, and particularly the collection which 
figured so prominently in the Liberal Arts Building. It was a special effort, care- 
fully planned and effectively carried out, and German foreign trade is feeling the 
stimulus of that costly display at the present moment. 
Our brief consideration of this subject suggests that, while it more immediately 
concerns the commercial supremacy of Great Britain, it has also a practical interest 
for the United States. In our future commercial development and expansion we 
shall certainly enter into a most active competition with the two nations above 
mentioned. It is a question which we shall do well to ask ourselves, whether our 
native inventiveness and mechanical skill should not be stimulated and rendered 
more efficient by such a triple alliance of science, industry, and organization as is 
now carrying Germany to the front by leaps and bounds. 
  
SALARIES or TEACHERS IN THE PEOPLE’S SCHOOLS IN GERMANY, 
The question of raising the salaries of teachers has of late been a 
subject of discussion in legislative bodies of the various German 
States, especially in Prussia. A bill laid before the Prussian Diet 
during its session in 1896 regulates the salaries, but in every case it 
refers to the minimum beginner’s salary, and leaves the adjustment of 
the maximum sum to the communities. The following tables, with 
explanations, are gathered from an article by Rector J. Tews, of Berlin, 
who carefully compiles and critically analyzes the educational statis- 
ties of his native country from official and private sources. He says: 
In order to present the situation as it now actually exists in Germany, it is neces- 
sary to bring together as many statements as possible. There are varied opinions 
as to what constitutes the proper pay for elementary school teachers. Vrom some 
States it was impossible to obtain the statistics, namely, from Alsace-Lorraine, Meck- 
lenburg, Schaumburg-Lippe, and Waldeck. Little irregularities could not be  
-P-A-G-E-224
  148° EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
avoided; they are explained in the text accompanying the tables. It is quite aston- 
ishing to see how many teachers are paid minimum salaries. According to the tables 
from Wiirtemberg that refer to the year 1891-92, there were 3,406 teachers, of whom 
511 were marked as belonging to the eleventh year of service, yet these 511 were still 
drawing the minimum salary. Besides, Wiirtemberg had in the same year 1,280 
teachers not definitely employed who had been teaching between one and ten years. 
_ - In Saxony, during the year 1894, Mr. Rocke prepared a statement from which it is 
seen that among 8,239 teachers there were 1,902 definitely engaged and 336 assistants 
who were still drawing the lowest salary, which is equal to 28.3 per cent of the 
whole number of teachers in Saxony and 26 per cent of the assistants. The tables 
following on pages 153 to 155 are arranged according to the annual increases pre- 
scribed by law or governmental regulation. 
1, Only the minimum salaries, with regular increases owing to the age a and length 
of service which are required by law, are recorded in this table. No voluntary 
addition to the salary voted for by communities has been considered. Though 
these cases are quite numerous, it did not seem to be correct to consider them, inas- 
much as it is the object to state the legal requirements only. 
2. Wherever in any State, as for instance in Hessia, Gotha, and Weimar, higher 
salaries are fixed by law for the cities and lower salaries for rural schools, the lower 
salaries have been inserted in the table in preference to the higher, the latter being 
in the minority. 
3. Where professional teachers, such as assistants, adjuncts, substitutes, etc., , 
receive a salary fixed by law, these salaries have been recorded in the proper col- 
umn. Where promotion to a definite appointment is not regulated by law, the 
ayerage provisional period is assumed. 
4, Where free fuel is granted in addition to the salary of teachers, 100 marks is 
added in the salary in the table, and 50 marks to that of assistants. This has been 
_ done with statements from Sondershausen and Liibeck, and also Saxony. For 
Hamburg a different figure had to be taken, namely, 150 marks for teachers and 50 
marks for assistants, since these are the actual sums paid. 
5. Wherever the teacher acts as organist or sexton and receives extra pay for such 
work, the pay is not mentioned in the tables, because, practically, it has nothing to 
do with the actual school work and its remuneration. 
Special notes are made with reference to each separate State: 
Bavaria: This Kingdom has no maximum salary fixed by law. The law prescribes: 
increases of 90 marks at intervals of five years. After forty years service the Bava- 
rian teachers draw 1,720 marks; after forty-five years, 1,810; after fifty years, 1,900 
marks; while the teachers in the Palatinate draw only 1,620, 1,710, and 1,800 marks, 
respectively. ‘This necessitated a double entry in the table foe Bavaria. 
In Wiirtemberg the beginners in the profession draw 620 marks per annum dur- 
ing the first five years, and 790 marks until they reach the tenth year, Aside from 
he salary, they are provided with a furnished room, fuel, and light. The.compiler 
has estimated the cost of this at 70 marks, hence the figures in the column will be 
found to be 690 and 860, respectively. Definitely appointed teachers are allowed. 
by law supplies to the amount of 70 marks. 
In Saxony the assistants are granted free fuel or a sum of 50 marks. Very few 
communities in Saxony have gone beyond the minimum salaries prescribed by law. 
In Baden the candidates, that is, the beginners, receive 800 marks, and after having 
passed their State examination the salary is increased to 900 marks. For older 
assistant teachers many communities pay as much as 1,100 marks, which is the begi 
ning salaries of rectors or principals. Rentis calculated at 150 marks for such tea 
ers. Principals in schools with four teachers receive 100 marks, and where the 
school has more than four teachers 200 marks, additional. If the teachers serve in 
supplementary schools and evening classes the work is paid for by the year, namely, 
100 marks. If he teaches gymnastics an additional 25 marks is paid. Since most 
        nS

EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 149 
teachers in small communities act as organists, and some as sextons, their income is 
increased to a much greater sum than is stated in the table. 
In Hessia a new law has been passed which will come into force April 1, 1897. 
Definite appointment of the teacher is calculated from the date of passing the second 
State examination, while in other States if is the first examination. This examina- 
tion is usually passed at the expiration of two years after graduating from the normal 
schools. In larger communities much higher salaries are paid, but since it is the 
cbject to show the minimum salaries they are omitted from the table. 
Oldenburg: The teachers in Oldenburg are classed as head teachers and assistants, 
Head teachers are the principals of graded schools and the teachers of ungraded 
schools in the country; all other teachers are called assistants. The minimum salary 
‘of a head teacher is 900 marks, but in the cities 180 to 300 marks are added. To the 
minimum (or ‘‘stock”) salary are also added six increases at 75 marks each after 
five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, and thirty years of service, counted from the 
definite appointment. The teachers are employed temporarily for nearly four years. 
There is a further classification of the assistants into those of the first and second 
class. This makes it difficult to calculate the salaries for insertion in the table. 
The increases are not in most cases regulated by law but depend upon the good will 
of the authorities in office. Hence the table contains statements for Oldenburg, 
with reference to the first ten years of service, that may not in every case be correct, 
but they are the result of careful computation. The higher salaries could not be 
stated with exactness either, since in most cases a local increase is voted which is 
rarely less than 300 marks. In graded schools the second teacher draws the salary 
of ahead teacher. The principal receives an indemnity of 90 to 120 marks if his 
school, or rather his residence, is not provided with an extensive garden in which to 
raise vegetables and fruit. This indemnity for land is invariably inserted in the 
table and quoted at 90 marks. The Government of Oldenburg is at present engaged 
in preparing a bill to regulate the salaries of teachers. 
In Weimar there is a distinction made between rural districts and towns of the 
third, second, and first class. The minimum salary fixed for towns of the third class 
ranges between 860 and 1,710 marks, in towns of the second class between 890 and 
1,860 marks, and in towns of the first class between 920 and 2,010 marks; obtainable 
after twenty-seven years of service, counted from the day of graduation in the nor- 
mal school. There is a moyement on foot in the duchy to do away with the differ- 
ences and place the teachers all on the same level with those of towns of the first 
class. The teachers also claim remuneration for service in church, either as organist 
or sexton, or whatever other service the church insists upon. 
In Brunswick the city teachers have between 750 and 2,100 marks; besides that 
they enjoy free rent, which in the country is paid “‘in natura” and is estimated at 150 
marks, or an indemnity of 90 marks for the first five years, 120 marks for the second 
five years, 150 marks for the third five years, and 180 marks after the eighteenth 
year of service. 
In Anhalt the teachers are not paid extra for rent. Where there is a residence for 
the teacher connected with the schoolhouse, rent is deducted from his stock salary. 
If lie draws less than 1,500 marks, the sum of 60 marks is deducted; if he draws more 
than 1,500 marks, 90 marks is deducted for the use of the residence. In the table 
these sums are already deducted. There is a slight difference between the salaries 
paid in small cities and in larger cities, but the teachers are endeavoring to equalize 
the salaries and the Government is willing to meet the teachers in this. 
In Gotha there is a higher scale of salaries for the three cities, Gotha, Ohrdruf, 
and Waltershausen, than the table contains. In Coburg the scales for city teachers 
are considerably higher than those mentioned in the table. In Meiningen the Goy- 
ernment gives the teachers un additional salary of from 100 to 200 marks and 200 
marks indemnity for rent. 
In Altenburg the rural teachers are classed with the teachers of towns of the third
-P-A-G-E-226
    150 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
class, and it is this minimum that is contained in the table. In Reuss (senior line) 
_ the head teachers receive an additional salary of 60 marks for supervision of their 
schools, but the cities pay the salaries. 
In Schwarzburg-Sondershausen rent is not paid, but fuel and light are allowed. 
These differences have been adjusted in the tables. 
Schaumburg-Lippe has not been inserted in the table because there was found no 
basis of comparison between the teachers called head teachers and assistants and 
between teachers of the various classes of towns. It may be stated, however, that 
the salaries range between 850 and 1,200 marks, and increase at intervals of five years 
100 marks each time. Increases are calculated from the day of definite appointment, 
and chureh service is calculated at 300 marks per year. 
The salaries of rural teachers of the State of Hamburg are as follows: Assistants — 
from six to eight years receive between 800 and 1,000 marks, a furnished room, and 
50 marks for fuel. Among the definitely appointed teachers, the following categories 
are to be distinguished:

To these sums must be added a fixed sum for rent for unmarried teachers, or a free 
dwelling, with garden and fuel, for married teachers. Where these can not be fur- 
nished in close proximity to the schoolhouse, an adequate sum of money is paid as 
an indemnity. At present the school council of the State of Hamburg is consid- 
ering a new scale of salaries, in which the minimum salaries are greatly increased. 
The so-called free city of Hamburg consists of the city proper, with about 500,000 
inhabitants, and a surrounding territory called Hamburg land; both together form 
one of the constituent States of the German Empire. 
Bremen: The figures quoted in the table for Bremen contain the sums paid for 
rent; hence they appear greater in comparison than they ought to be. It is reason- 
able to deduct 20 per cent to arrive at the actual salary and thus make them com- 
parable with the other salaries granted. 
Liibeck: The rural teachers of the country districts of the free city of Liibeck 
haye free dwelling, fuel, and not less than 25 acres of garden and field. This is very 
much more than is comprised in the provisions for Prussian teachers, since Prussian 
teachers are provided with the kitchen garden, but certainly not with 25 acres of 
field. Fuel for the teachers in Liibeck has been calculated at 100 marks, hence the 
scale quoted should read 1,000 to 1,500 marks, beginning with the fifth year of 
service. 
Though all these various calculations, which were unavoidable in the attempt 
to equalize the figures so as to enable comparison, may not in every case be abso- 
lutely correct, they are certainly as near the truth and the actual facts as possible. 
Essential errors are excluded and the figures submitted in the following tables, 
therefore, with the possible exception of Oldenburg and Bremen, offer a safe basis 
for comparison, 
The first of the two tables following makes possible the reply to a number of 
important questions, for instance: What salary is offered a teacher at an age when 
marriage seems proper and advisable? Let us take a completed twenty-eighth year
-P-A-G-E-227
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. aE 
of life, which would be about the ninth year of service as a teacher, and we shall 
see that (excluding Bremen) Hessia stands at the head with 1,200 marks, while 
Prussia falls short of that by 220 marks. After twenty-five years of service the 
teachers in Anhalt are at the head with 1,860 marks, while those of Prussia fall 
short by 420 marks. The figures in full-face type indicate the date at which the 
maximum salary is reached. Here we notico enormous differences. Hamburg (land) 
stands atthe head with from seventeen to twenty years of service; Wiirtemberg a 
the foot of the scale with thirty-six years of service. Bavaria has no maximum 
salary fixed at all. 
‘The second table contains the total sums paid for salary as well as average sums. 
These figures appear to be of greater value than those of the first table, inasmuch as 
they exemplify the actual value of certain orders or classes. In both grand totals, 
namely, in that of twenty-five years and that of fifty years of service, the little 
State of Anhalt is at the head, while Prussia remains behind with 227 and 323 marks, 
respectively. 
If the numerical relation of the Prussian teachers is taken into consideration, a 
greater emphasis must be laid upon the salaries up to the twenty-fifth years of sery- _ 
ice; greater, certainly, than upon the increases offered after that time. For this rea- 
son in the year 1891 there were engaged of every 100 teachers—

The salary reached after the thirtieth year of service is drawn only by one-seventh 
of the total number of teachers, while two-thirds of them reach the salary offered 
at fifteen years of service. 
The figures in the tables must not be mistaken to mean minimum income, but they 
are to represent the salaries only. There are other sources of income for teachers, 
and their normal school training prepares them for that purpose. The professional 
preparation of a teacher includes instrumental and vocal music, particularly the 
playing of the organ. Wo quote a few figures showing what income teachers in 
Germany derive from this church service; but it must be understood that the figures 
are all minimum not maximum salaries, since it is the intention to show the mini- 
mum incomo of German teachers. 
In Bavaria service as organist or sexton is paid for only in a few communities, 
and the compiler is unable to state the salary with any degree of accuracy. In 
Wiirtemberg the teacher is expected to serve in church without any special pay 
whatever. In Saxony the income from church service is calculated only when it 
amounts to more than 900 marks. In Baden all church service on the part of the 
teacher is prohibited except that as organist, and the least salary paid for that is 
100 marks a year; but in most cases it is much more. In Hessiathe same conditions 
prevail. In Oldenburg the highest salary for service in church is paid in the Prot- 
estant communities, namely, 300 marks. In Catholic communities the payment of 
salary is not regulated, and varies considerably. In Weimar the teachers’ pay for 
serving in church is not regulated either. In Brunswick 200 marks, in Anhalt 
between 100 and 150 marks are paid, while in Gotha the rural districts pay only 99 
marks. In Coburg the salaries for church service vary and are not regulated. In 
Meiningen the salaries for church service in rural districts amount to 175 to 250 
marks, In Altenburg no salary is paid, and in Reuss (senior line) 240 marks while 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  
  152 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
in Reuss (junior line) 200 marks are paid. Schwarzburg-Rodolstadt pays from 100 
to 150 marks. In Schwarzburg-Sondershausen 200 marks; in Lippe, according to 
the size of the congregation, from 70 to 250 marks; in Schaumberg-lippe, 300 marks; 
in Bremen (rural districts) between 200 and 600 marks. These sums must be divided 
by four to express them in American money, but that procedure would not approx- 
imately come near the real state of affairs, because the purchasing power of money 
is very much greater in Germany than it is in America; however, while the neces- 
sities of life, such as bread, fruit, and meat, are only a little cheaper than in this 
country, everything that bears the character of luxury or contributes to comfort is 
vastly cheaper than in this country. ‘ 
One more point may be stated, and that is the number of years after which a 
definite appointment can take place That period is counted from the date of grad- 
uation from the normal school. Bavaria, after seven years; Wiirtemberg, after nine 
to ten years; Saxony, after three years; Baden, after eight years; Hessia, after 
fourtofive years; Oldenburg, after four years; Weimar, after two years; Brunswick, 
after five years; Anhalt, after two years; Gotha, after two years; Coburg, after two 
years; Meiningen, after two years; Altenburg, after two years; Reuss (senior line), 
_ after two years; Reuss (junior line), after two years; Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, after 
two years; Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, after two years; Lippe, after four years; 
Hamburg (land), after five to eight years; Bremen (land), after five years; Liibeck 
(land), after four years. 
We add a list of German cities with the statement of average salaries paid to 
teachers in elementary schools. This list has been compiled from a work entitled 
“Die Gehaltsverhiiltnisse der Volksschullehrer,” by H. Henck and H. Ischerland. 
A eursory glance at this table will show that the teachers in cities are not as well 
provided for as they deserve.     
  
AVERAGE SALARIES IN GERMAN CITIES IN 1889. 
As a basis of calculation it is assumed that the average length of service of teach- 
ers in Germany is thirty years. Calculations made in this Bureau from official 
tables published by the minister of education in Berlin make this appear correct, 
for the result arrived at was twenty-nine years and five months. The following list 
states the amount of salary only, and does not include any indemnity for rent, which 
is almost invariably paid, in addition to the salary, at the rate of 20 per cent of the 
latter. For the convenience of American readers the amounts are expressed in 
dollars and cents: 5

  156 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
SALARIES OF TEACHERS IN THE PEOPLE’S SCHOOLS OF AUSTRIA. 
The Yearbook of Political Economy and Statistics, edited in Jena, 
Germany, by four eminent university professors of Halle, Breslau, and 
Gottingen, contains in the second number of the volume for 1896 an 
article on the income of persons engaged in elementary and burgher 
schools. The author refers in this to the forty-second volume of 
“Austrian Statistics, Official Organ of the Government”, which gives 
minute information concerning the expenditures for public education 
in Austria. This publication is especially welcome, since information 
on this subject has been very difficult to obtain. The position of 
Austrian teachers is a new factor in the social life of the Empire. This 
is plainly seen from the rapid increase both in the number of teachers 
~ and the amount of salaries paid.

1891 25, 738, 000 
        
During the last twenty-five years about 20,000 teachers have been 
added to the number engaged in 1865, and the great change in their 
social position is seen from the fact that their entire income to-day is 
five times greater than it was twenty-five years ago. But if we con- 
sider that the number has doubled, we may take it that the same social 
stratum of 1865, placed on an equal footing with 1890, may be said to 
have an income two and one-half times as great as twenty-five years ago. | 
Many of the 40,000 teachers (the annual statisties published by the 
Government shows the number of teachers to be in the neighborhood 
of 70,000 instead of 40,000, but this includes all teachers of religion and 
special branches, such as music, drawing, gymnastics, etc., which special 
teachers are not included in the number of regular class teachers; the 
40,133 includes only class teachers, such as head teachers and princi- 
pals, teachers and assistants) are engaged in city schools; hence the 
profession of teaching begins to exercise a political influence in munici- 
pal public life. That the teachers in Austria are considered a new 
factor with which it is well to reckon is seen from the action taken by 
the legislative bodies of the Empire as well as of the Crown land. As 
is well known, the citizens of Austria and Germany are divided into 
electoral classes, and the teachers are included in the class of officers 
of the State. These classes vote separately on election day, and the 
intelligence of the teachers in political affairs is not without influence, 
as is plainly seen in large cities, such as Vienna. 
The constantly increasing number of women teachers also is an impor- + 
tant social factor. At present the number of women teachers is a little 
less than one-fifth of the total number. The numerical relation of the

female sex in the various grades of the profession may be seen from the 
following table: 
  
| Men. Women. | Total. 
  
       
    Principals and head teachers | 8,284 Teachers ....-- 15, 318 Assistants, defi 5, 276 5, 121   
  This table shows that the position of women among the head teachers 
is a subordinate one, since in the highest grade, in that of principals 
and head teachers, the women are represented only by one-twentieth 
of the number; in the next lower grade, in that of teachers, they are 
represented by only one-fifth of the number; but in the next lower 
grade, in that of assistants, they are represented by one-fourth of the 
number. The cause is, partly, that the women in Austria have only 
recently turned to the profession of teaching; hence those engaged in 
it are not experienced—that is to say, not old enough to have been 
promoted to the highest grades of the profession. But the cause may 
also lie in the fact that the governmental authorities do not consider 
women adapted for executive duties. 
A better insight into the social position of the teachers in Austria, 
and partly into the difference existing between the social position of 
the two sexes, is gained by a study of the following table, based upon 
official data of 1890: 
Salaries of teachers in elementary and burgher schools in Austria, 1890.

If the foregoing data are grouped we obtain the following represen- 
tation: 
  
Salaries. | Men. | Women. 
| ‘Par want: libby cont Less than 600 florins ake 48.8 62.9 
600 to 1,000 florins. | 
| More than 1,000 florins. 
            
This shows that nearly one-half of the men and two-thirds of the 
women teachers receive the “minimum of existence,” which statisticians 
have estimated at 630 florins ($303.66); 425 per cent of the men and 
32.6 per cent of the women receive salaries ranging from 600 to 1,000 
florins. This again shows a very disadvantageous position of the female 
sex, which is particularly noticeable in the highest group, where only 44 
per cent of the women are ranged, while 8.7 per cent of the men are 
found there. : 
The foregoing tables plainly exhibit the fact that the income of | 
teachers, be they men or women, is low, about 650 florins at an average. 
Although the sum total paid to the teachers amounts to nearly 
26,000,000 florins, and although this social class has become an impor- 
tant political factor, it must still be admitted that the pecuniary condi- 
tion of many teachers in Austria is very modest indeed. This is the 
more striking as the school laws passed in 1868 lifted the profession 
of teaching to a new social footing. The appropriations and taxes 
voted for and paid by communities, districts, and Crown lands for school 
purposes, and which have during the last thirty years added new 
burdens to the taxpayers, are constantly increasing. Modern life lays 
claims upon the exchequer of the modern State which were unknown 
in former times. The new school buildings, furniture, and equipment 
require enormous sums; so that interest-bearing debts increase the 
annual appropriations for school purposes and even frustrate the best 
intentions of raising the salaries of the teachers. Austria has just 
cause to be proud of its enormous expenditures for school purposes in 
recent years, and particularly for its magnificent school buildings. The 
teachers of Austria stand foremost in the profession and command 
the respect of the world for their heroic efforts in behalf of public 
education. 
REFORM SCHOOLS IN THE GRAND DucHY OF BADEN, GERMANY. 
The system of reform schools! in the Grand Duchy of Baden in Ger- 
many is regulated by law of May, 1886, which began to operate January, 
1887. The secretaries of the departments of justice and the interior 
  1These data are translated from a Germa agazine of recognized authority in 
statistics, Jahrbiicher fiir National Oeckonomie und Statistik, Volume XIII, Heft 3, 
page 446.   
-P-A-G-E-235
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 189 
prepared the rules and regulations necessitated by the new law. The 
law is similar to paragraph 55 of the Imperial Criminal Code, adopted 
February 26,1876. According to this code, persons who commit a crime 
before they are 12 years of age can not be tried for crime, but may be 
kept in custody for the purpose of reforming them, according to the 
special law of the separate State. Such children may be placed under 
reform training, if both the criminal and the orphan court have so 
decreed. 
The Baden law goes two steps farther than the general imperial code: 
(1) It fixes the maximum time limit at 16 years of age; that is to say, 
juvenile criminals are not prosecuted. or tried for crime in Baden if less 
than 16 years of age, but are retained in reform schools. (2) The law 
does not confine its operations to criminal acts, but requires that youths 
up to 16 years of age be assigned to reform schools for moral misde- 
/meanors, provided (a) that parents or guardians endanger the moral 
life of the children by misuse of their authority or by neglect; or (b) 
that the conduct of the children proves that neither the good efforts of 
parents and guardians nor the means of discipline in schcol are adequate 
to prevent their moral depravity. 
The Baden law (section 12) further decrees that if a person accused 
of crime between 12 and 18 years of age! is acquitted owing to his 
tender age and want of good judgment, the court shall state whether 
he is to be returned to his family, or placed in custody of another family, 
or be detained in a reform school. 
The execution of the law is left in the hands of the county courts 
(criminal and probate “Bezirks-Aemter”). The courts are charged 
with the careful investigation of the conditions of the child’s home 
environments, in order to decide whether the home gives proper assur- 
ance of wholesome influence in the future. In aggravated cases of 
moral depravity, which require constant supervision and strict disei- 
pline, the culprit is to be sent to a reform school without further delay. 
Concerning the age of reform school pupils, only the maximum (16 or 
18 years, respectively) is clearly defined, while with regard to the mini- 
mum the law is silent; but the ministerial regulations state that chil- 
dren under 6 years should be sent to reform schools only in specially 
urgent cases. The law specifically states that poorhouses, hospitals, 
and asylums for persons of defective senses are not to be regarded or 
used as reform schools in the sense of the law; but it admits to legal 
recognition as reform schools all institutions established by corpora 
tions and private persons or through endowment which have the pur- 
pose of saving morally depraved children and training them to be useful 
citizens and members of society. This recognition is granted by the 
seeretary of the interior; courts are not permitted to designate any 
institution as a reform school so long as the secretary of the interior 
withholds his recognition. 
1In exceptional cases the time limit is extended to 19 years.

    160 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The State’s right to educate “by force” (that is, in reform schools) 
ends with the completed eighteenth year of the juvenile offender. 
Pupils may be dismissed from reform schools before they are 18, if the 
purpose of their reform training has been accomplished, or if it is rea- 
sonably secured by other means. ‘This release is revocable at first, for 
if inquiry reveals that the guardians fail to follow up the good work of 
the school, a pupil may be brought back by the police. 
One-third of the costs of this compulsory training is borne by the 
poor fund of the town or district from which the pupil comes. In case 
the parents can afford to defray the expense, the town may collect from 
them, and the State bears two-thirds of the expenses, except the cost 
of traveling, which must be borne by the town or district. 3 
So much concerning the legal requirements. Now Ict us see what the 
results of this compulsory training are. According to official state- 
ments (year 1893) the number of pupils in the various institutions for 
that. purpose and under the charge of families, was:

From this table it is seen that more boys than girls were subjected) 
to'compulsory training. In 1893 the number of boys amounted to 67.2 
per cent of the total number, hence more than two-thirds. Itis of inter- 
est to note, also, that the percentage of illegitimate children decreased 
from 18 to 14 per cent within six years. It is evident that family life 
‘in Baden has improved even in the strata from which refractory and 
depraved children are taken to reform schools. The official statement 
from which the contents of this article are drawn gives no information 
concerning the occupation or profession of the fathers. 
With reference to the kind of provision made for the children in need 
of compulsory training, it is stated that 440 (36.5 per cent) of the total 
number in 1893 were assigned to private families and 763 (63.4 per 
cent) to institutions, so-called reform farms or reform schools. Of 
the whole number (1,038), the majority (namely, 888) were less than 14 
years old, and of these 336 (37.8 per cent) were placed in private 
families, while 552 (62.2 per cent) were assigned to institutions. Of the 
315 who had passed the fourteenth year of life, 104 (33 per cent) were 
placed in families, and 211 (67 per cent) in institutions. Year after year, 
as the operation of the law became more effective, and the number 
of children assigned to compulsory training increased, the number of

those assigned to reformatory institutions remained in the majority. 
The latter proportion amounted to 57.3, 61, 60.8, 68.4, 65.7, 68.2, and 
61.3 per cent in the successive years from 1887 till 1893. At the close 
of the year 1893, 19 pupils (1.9 per cent) of reform schools or given into 
eustody of private families had escaped from supervision. 
Of the 290 boys over 14 years of age assigned to families, 224 were 
apprentices learning trades; 114 in cities, 110 in the country. Of 
these apprentices 144 were between 14 and 16 years of age, while 68 
were 17 years, 6 were 18 years, and 6 were 19 years of age. 
The causes which induced the authorities to assign these boys to 
reformatory training were (a) degrading influence on the part of the 
parents in 71 cases, (b) depravity of the children despite good home 
influence in 153 cases. The conduct of 186 apprentices out of 224 (83 
per cent) was réported to be good or satisfactory. Forty trades or 
oceupations were represented by the apprentices; 33 were employed as 
stable boys, 23 as farm hands, 19 learned the cobbler’s trade, 18 were 
in joiner’s shops, 17 were bakers, 17 tailors, 11 saddlers, ete. 
Of the 82 girls over 14 years of age assigned to families, 46 were 
employed as house servants, 3 as factory hands, 6 as dressmakers and 
seamstresses. Of these 55 pupils, 42 were between 14 and 16 years of 
age, 9 were 17, 3 were 18, and 1 was 19 years of age. 
The causes for which they had been placed under compulsory train- 
ing were (a) degrading influence on the part of the parents in 33 cases, 
(b) depravity of the children despite good home influence or neglect in 
22 cases. The conduct of 45 (81.8 per cent) proved very satisfactory. 
The official data give no information concerning the occupation of 
children under.14 years of age, but it is presumed that they attend 
school. 
Considerable differences are noticeable in the ages of the pupils. 
They are here tabulated in percentages for each year that the law has 
been in operation:

While the annual number of children between 10 and 14 years of age 
remained at about one-half of the sum total, the numbers of those under 
10 and over 14 show an almost uniform change, the former of descend- 
ing the latter of ascending tendency. From this it is seen that the 
authorities commit young children to compulsory training much more

rarely of late years than seemed desirable at the beginning. It is 
possible that the cost of maintenance of these children induces the 
authorities not to resort to reform training. 
German governmental authorities recognize in their statistical tabu- 
lations only three religious denominations: Catholic, Protestant, and 
Jews, to which sometimes they add a column for Dissenters “ or others.” 
The proportion of Catholics and Protestants among the children under 
discussion was as follows: 
  
    Year. | Catholics. | Protestants. 
= ; 4 
Per cent. Per cent. 
58.1 41.9

72.4 27.6 
65.7 34.3 
64.7 35.3 
64.7 35.3 
      
This proportion is very nearly analogousto the proportion of Catholics 
and Protestants in the population which was in 1890, 36 per cent 
Protestants and 62 per cent Catholics. 
It is interesting to observe how many of the children under reforma- 
tory training had parents. At the time when the courts decided upon 
their fate there had—

Of the total number 46,3 per cent had both parents living, 18.6 per 
cent had only father left, 30.9 per cent only a mother, and 4.2 per cent 
were orphans. The remarkably greater representation of children who 
had no father is explained by the relatively large proportion of illegiti- 
mate children, partly owing to the relatively larger number of widows. 
The census of 1890 showed that Baden had 29,521 widowers and 70,236 
widows. Another cause of the apparent disproportion may be found 
in the fact that woman’s labor is poorly paid, hence that lone mothers 
are not always able to properly train and look after their children. 
Likewise interesting is the fact that among the 224 children who had 
only a father 29 per cent were girls, and that among the 372 who had 
only a mother 35.5 per cent were girls.

The following table gives information concerning the causes that 
made reformatory training necessary : 
| Parents endan- Depravity or | | gering children’s inadequate Criminal acts. Year. character. home training. 
| 
The length of reformatory training in 26 cases was less than one 
year; in 44 cases, one to two years; in 65 cases, two to three years; in 
51 cases, three to four years; in 41 cases, four to five years; in 17 cases, 
five to six years, and in 5 cases, over six years. Children released were 
returned to their parents in 63 cases; given over to relatives or guard- 
ians in 16 cases; 121 entered some sort of service; of the remaining 32 
eases, 5 “went to America;” 9 having learned a trade, became travel- 
ing journeymen; 3 remained in the institutions to learn housekeeping; 
3 were sent to asylums for idiots or insane; 7 escaped; 4 were taken to 
prison, and 1 girl was “lost in bad company.” 
Of all those who since 1888 had been released, 125 (among whom 
were 13 girls) entered upon some kind of industrial pursuit; 23 (only 
boys) chose farm labor; 41 (of 70) girls entered upon domestic service. 
These facts give hints as to the strata of society from which the chil- 
dren came. 
The results or effects of reformatory training depend essentially upon 
the causes which necessitate it, that is to say, whether the children are 
subjected to dangerous parental influence, or whether their home influ- 
ence, though not vicious, is nevertheless injurious, because inadequate, 
or whether their own depravity is so great that society is endangered 
by them. It depends, furthermore, upon the sex, age, and method of 
training of the pupils, and, lastly, upon their being assigned to an 
institution or to a private family. With regard to these various influ- 
ences, the statistical data at hand state results which may be tabulated. 
To facilitate comparison ratios are employed. Of every 100 pupils the 
effect was—

The data show that the effect of compulsory training is not the same 
for both sexes, nor the same with regard to institute and family train- 
ing. Generally speaking, the results are less favorable with the boys 
than with the girls; much more favorable with children under 14 years 
of age than with those over 14, and less favorable among those who were 
admitted owing to inadequate home influence or their own depravity. 
In viewing the effects of family and institute training it must be borne 
in mind that (1) the worst characters are assigned to institutions—chil- 
dren who could not well be put in families, and\(2) that the opinion 
concerning what is satisfactory conduct in institutions and families is 
not in all cases equally well based. 
The expenditures for the support of pupils under compulsory training 
amounted to—

  $9,857 | $22.71

5, 083 5, 20, 697 21.74 
3, 549 19, 826 19.10 
The decrease in expenditures is explained by the more frequent assign- 
ment of children to families who desire to take them free of cost, a 
practice which does not recommend itself, since experience shows that 
the children thus assigned are unduly burdened with work and merely 
used as drudges, and that the families who petition that pupils be 
assigned to them do not always exercise the most wholesome educa- 
tional influence upon their charges. 
It is a matter of self-evidence that the cities furnish a larger propor- 
tion of pupils who need reformatory training than the rural districts. 
Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Freiburg, and Heidelberg are represented with
-P-A-G-E-241
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 165° 
87 per cent of the sum total of pupils, though these cities have only 23 
per cent of the population of the Grand Duchy. 
The population of the United States is about thirty-six times greater 
than that of Baden; hencé we ought to have 39,368 children under 
reformatory training, taking the number Baden represents as a cri- 
terion, while actually we have only 20,201, according to the statistics 
offered in the Annual Report of the Commissioner of Education for 
1893-94. These 20,201 children cost the States (in 1893) $2,562,411, 
which is $126.85 per capita, cost of permanent improvements for grounds’ 
and buildings not counted. The per capita in Baden was $19.10 in 1893, 
This enormous difference is explained by the foregoing facts. 
STATISTICS OF GERMAN, AUSTRIAN, AND Swiss UNIVERSITIES, POLY- 
TECHNICA, AGRICULTURAL, VETERINARY, FORESTRY, AND MIN- 
ING ACADEMIES. 
The statistical data concerning German universities offered in the. 
following tables are based upon official publications for the two semes- 
ters quoted, namely, the winter semester of 1894-95 and the summer 
semester of 1895. The Lyceum Hosianum in Braunsberg has not been 
included, inasmuch as the characteristics of a university are wanting 
there; it comprises only a theological faculty. The data concerning 
the agricultural school in organic connection with the university of 
Bonn do not reveal a separate number of students; this, however, is a 
mere trifle. 
The data concerning the polytechnical and other professional schools 
are based upon direct information furnished by the officials of these 
institutions. It was somewhat difficult to state the totals correctly, 
since the course of study in these institutions varies considerably, some 
leaning more toward mechanical engineering, others toward other 
branches of technology. The statements concerning the number of 
foreigners among the students of technological universities are not 
complete, although it would be particularly interesting to compare the 
attendance of foreign students in these institutions with that in uni- 
versities. Irregularities and peculiarities in the employment of pro- 
fessors and the attendance of students are stated in footnotes to each 
table. 
The tables are compiled by the editor of the Academische Revue, 
published in Munich. (No. 16,-vol. 2, pp. 200-212.)

  180 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
FOREIGNERS IN UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER HIGHER INSTITUTIONS 
or LEARNING IN GERMANY, AUSTRIA, AND SWITZERLAND, SUMMER 
oF 1895, 
The statistics offered in the following tables are taken from official 
statements furnished by the rectors of the various institutious men- 
tioned. They are here reproduced from the Academische Revue of 
March, 1896. A glance at the totals shows that the nuinber of foreign- 
ers studying in Germany is not inconsiderable. It must be borne in 
mind, however, that the numbers given represent only those of matric- 
ulated students, for those are the only ones who can be considered in 
official reports. The number of those who visit German institutions as 
hearers for some length of time, and without being matriculated attend 
clinics, work in laboratories, and listen to private lectures, is very large, 
but can not be stated with accuracy. It is estimated that that number 
exceeds those of matriculated foreigners. In the summer of 1895 the 
universities and other institutions of learning in Germany had upon 
their rolls the names of 3,362 foreigners. That is, in comparison to the 
total number of matriculated students, equal to 8.48 per cent. Of these 
3,362 foreigners the universities proper had 2,015 (7 per cent), the 
polytechnica 1,041 (15.1 per cent), the veterinary schools 15 (1.53 per 
cent), the agricultural academies 101 (9.37 per cent), the forestry acade- 
inies 58 (138.6 per cent), and the mining academies 152 (32.4 per cent). 
Of the 3,362 foreigners there were 966 Russians, 514 Americans, 467 
Austrians and Hungarians, 346 Swiss, 180 Englishmen, 158 Hollanders, 
142 Bulgarians, 116 Swedes and Norwegians, 82 Roumanians, 69 Ital- 
ians, 57 Asiatics, 53 Frenchmen, 37 Servians, 36 Belgians, 36 Turks, 
27 Greeks, 26 Danes, 22 Africans, 14 Australians, 8 Spaniards, 4 Por- 
tuguese, and 2 Montenegrians. 
In the Austrian universities and other institutions there were matric- 
“ulated 1,106 foreigners in the summer of 1895 among a total of 18,031 
students, or 6.14 per cent. Of these 1,106 foreigners there were 987 
(6.58 per cent) students of universities, the polytechnica had 84 (3.1 
per cent), the mining academies 16 (7 per cent), and the agricultural 
academy in Vienna had 19 (7.66 per cent). The 1,106 foreigners con- 
sisted of 239 Germans, 236 Russians, 115 Servians, 111 Italians, 106 
Americans, 76 Roumanians, 71 Bulgarians, 33 Turks, 31 Englishmen, 
25 Swiss, 11 Greeks, 10 Frenchmen, 9 Hollanders, 9 Swedes and 
Norwegians, 8 Africans, 6 Belgians, 6 Asiatics, 3 Spaniards, and 
1 Montenegrian. 
The Swiss higher seats of learning matriculated no less than 1,667 
foreigners among a total of 3,908 students. The percentage of foreign- 
ers here was 42.6. The universities alone enrolled 1,341, or 42.2 per 
cent, and the polytechnical school in Ziirich 326, or 43 per cent, of a 
total number of the matriculated students. Of the 1,667 foreigners 
Germany had sent 549, Russia 399, Austria-Hungary 143, Bulgaria 137,

Roumania 86, Italy 68, America 65, France 63, Asia 26, Holland 25, 
Turkey 22, England 20, Greece 19, Servia 17, Sweden and Norway 15, 
Denmark 5, Belgium 3, Portugal 2, Africa 2, Spain 1. 
From these summaries it is seen that as far as attendance of foreign- 
ers is concerned, Switzerland ranks first with 42.6 per cent of the total 
number, then follows Germany with 8.48 per cent, and lastly Austria 
with 6.14 per cent. This does not, as has been said before, include the 
so-called free lances who attend these higher seats of learning only for 
a time and who, being without proper preparation, can not matriculate, 
hence can not be counted as students by the officers of the institutions. 
They have, as a matter of self-evidence, most of the privileges of the 
students by becoming the private students of renowned professors, 
have access to the libraries, laboratories, experimental stations, and 
other accessories which are open to those who can pay the fees. In 
Germany it is the mining academies which are, comparatively, attended. 
most frequently by foreigners (32.4 per cent), and the veterinary schools 
are attended least by foreigners (1.53 per cent). The proportion of for- 
eiguers in German universities has risen from 5.16 per cent in the year 
1880 to 8.48 per cent-in 1895. In Austria the school of agriculture in 
Vienna has the greatest proportion of foreigners, namely, 7.66 per cent, 
while the polytechnica have only 3.1 per cent. In Switzerland univer- 
sities and the polytechnical school are attended by foreigners at about 
an equal ratio. 
We give the tables in full as found in the Academische Revue.

INTRODUCTION, 
The study of music in the schools of this country is attracting special 
attention among teachers, especially since the department of music of 
the National Education Association has been making inquiries into the 
history and methods of this branch of study. The situation is rather 
emphatically stated in an article in The Citizen (June, 1896) by Prof. 
T. W. Surette. The author asks: 
WHAT PART SHOULD MUSIC HAVE IN EDUCATION? 
Looking at the present condition of music in America—taking the country as a 
whole—one is struck by the fact that in spite of our great progress there does not 
yet exist any real relation between music and life. By this I mean that we have 
not yet apprehended what music really is; it appeals to most of us only as an inno- 
cent sort of amusement, and the idea of giving it any place in education and think- 
ing of it as a potent factor in civilization, is only in its infancy. 
It seems timely, therefore, to say a word as to what may be done in the way of 
bringing music more closely to people, so that a better use may be made of its great 
power as an educational factor, and to show wherein that power lies; to explain, as 
far as may be, just what the relation is between music and life, and how it may 
reach us and help us. 
It is not difficult to understand why music is universal. It antedates language. 
It is the ery, in its infancy nothing but a wild chant of joy or sorrow, analogous 
to the cry of animals; afterward the rude song of victory or the wail of death; 
then the fisherman’s song, the reaper’s, the soldier’s—each giving expression to those 
feelings for which speech is inadequate; without art, hut true to nature. Through 
all these stages of civilization it has been increasing its power of expression, keep- 
ing pace with the widening range of human activity, with the spread of knowledge, 
growing as naturally as a tree grows, having a form as beautiful and well ordered 
as any form nature has molded. Where once it expressed the emotions of rude 
peoples, it now has come to be the voice of our highest aspirations, to picture for us 
what we should, without it, never see. As Carlyle puts it, “It takes us to the edge 
of the infinite and lets us for moments gaze into that.” 
187
-P-A-G-E-264
  188 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Tt is the language of the emotions; in its highest expression it gives you the 
very essence of beauty. Take the Heroic Symphony, for example. If you under- 
stand it, you get from hearing it a picture more vivid and real than any verbal 
description could be of that turbid, fitful, solitary, and tragic thing which is the life 
of a great man. No words can convey to you as this music does the heroism, 
beauty, and love which are there. The inevitable and onward marching fate, the 
very ideal of it all—its essence—is perfectly expressed by the music. Words are 
but symbols through which the ideas and emotions try to find vent; music is.their 
natural and real voice. Every other medium gives them to you at secondhand. 
But of what practical use is all this? you say. What relation between music and 
life have you established by this statement of what music is? How does it affect 
morals or conduct? 
It al] depends on your point of view. If you think education consists in knowing 
facts; if your idea of a thorough preparation for life is a knowledge of geometry, 
history, and the other things usually learned in school and college, then you will 
not agree with me that music should find a place in our scheme of education. Music 
will not make two cabbages grow where there was only one before; it will not sat- 
isfy you as a good dinner will; it will not give you the consolation to be derived 
from a spring bonnet. 
But if education is that sweetening of life which comes from happy surroundings, 
from a home where only the most refined influences gather; if it is the broadening 
of your mind and heart from love of nature, from observation, from experience; if 
it is the growth in your soul of the love of beauty; in short, if it is all those things 
which tend to make you a better man and a better citizen, then music is a serious, 
a logical, and a powerful factor in it. 
I don’t suppose any argument is necessary to prove the influence on character of 
great poetry, painting, or sculpture. What I desire to show is how much more active 
the influence of music is; how thoroughly wholesome, and how easily obtained. 
There is a whole side of our nature which is left untouched by the ordinary affairs 
of life, and you find men who have devoted themselves to business exclusively, or 
to the pursuit of knowledge in one form or another, in whom the perception of 
beauty, with all the inspiration which comes from it, is almost totally inactive. It 
is perhaps a rather extreme case, but an interesting one, which Darwin’s life pre- 
sents. He says in his autobiography that up to the time he was 30 he derived great 
pleasure from Milton, Byron, Wordsworth, and Shelley; that Shakespeare gave 
him intense delight, and that he was fond of music; but in later life he couid not 
endure to read a line of poetry; Shakespeare nauseated him, and he had entirely 
lost his taste for music. 
“My mind,” he says, ‘‘seems to have become a kind of machine for grinding general 
laws out of large collections of facts. If I had to live my life over again I would 
have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once a week; 
for perhaps the part of my brain now atrophied would thus have been kept active 
through use. The loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may possibly be 
injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral character, by enfeebling 
the emotional part of our nature.” 
This is, perhaps, too negative an illustration to carry conviction with it; but a 
positive expression of what the effect would be if one were to hear music continually 
is a little difficult. You can not measure such things by the rule of three. A tape 
measure is not of much use in estimating the beauty of the Venus of Milo, but there 
is no doubt that we are moved to the depths of our natures by the visions which we 
are youchsafed by great music. When we are educated to listen to it, it touches us 
as nothing else can. For this reason, as well as because it is a so much more common 
factor in life than painting or sculpture—so much more easily obtained—I believe it 
“should be an active influence in education. 
For you may reasonably hope to do more with an art which appeals to the mass of 
the people than with one in which only a few are interested. In addition, there is 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
MUSIC IN GERMAN SCHOOLS. 189 
this further point: The influence of music is without taint; it does not give you 
immorality under the guise of art. 
But you may say that music is fast becoming all that it is claimed it should be, 
We have our seasons of opera, our great orchestras;.we crowd to the recitals of a 
famous pianist, and from one end of the country to the other thousands of people 
are engaged in teaching music; every country village has its half dozen professors, 
and altogether it seems as if we were really making music a factor in education. 
And there is no doubt whatever that we have advanced very much in the last twenty- 
five years; we have passed through the stage when Monastery Bells was a classic. 
But there is one fundamental difficulty with it all; we are on the wrong track. We 
are not making music a logical factor in education; we do not study it, nor under- 
stand it in a logical way; we do not even look on it as possessing the quality of 
logic, and we take it, or tolerate it, as a harmless kind of amusement. There is no 
doubt, for example, that in our church services, where it plays so important a part, 
it is simply tolerated by many people, even by some of the clergy. The names of 
the men who have written great church musie are, in many cases, entirely unknown. 
As a consequence of this ignorance, a great part of our church music is vapid, not 
to say irreligious, and it rarely appeals to you as an integral part of the worship. 
Of course, if it is to be the factor in education which we have here proclaimed it, 
it must possess the qualities of greatness. To be great an art must be capable of 
quickening the imagination; it must present beauty which compels you in spite of 
yourself; it must give you a consistent, logical, and satisfying picture; it must have 
a physiognomy, a plan, a consistent purpose throughout. Everything great has 
these qualities, this organic nature. Without it nothing can exist, neither an insti- 
tution, nor an art, nor the human body. 
Furthermore, it will be conceded that some understanding of this organic nature 
is necessary if we are to derive great good from the thing which possesses it, and, in 
the case of music, the conditions which surround it as an art are so peculiar that an 
understanding of its organism is absolutely necessary. A symphony possesses to an 
eminent degree the qualities I have enumerated as essential to a great piece of art, 
and, to a less degree, the same thing may be said of all music. 
A moment’s thought about the manner in which our impressions from music are 
received, however, will convince anyone that order and balance are absolutely essen- 
tial to it. A piece of music which lasted ten or fifteen minutes, in which those 
qualities were absent, would be meaningless to everyone. The very nature of a 
musical phrase demands its repetition in some form or another in order to have con- 
tinuity; otherwise it would not remain in the memory. In a symphony or sonata 
the themes are changed, thrown into new lights, dismembered, enlarged, treated in 
adozen different ways, not unlike the manner in which ideas are developed in a 
sermon, or characters in a book or play. But it is all done in the ten or fifteen min- 
utes, and when it is over you have only a faint notion of a tune here and there and 
of a hopeless noise which has seemed confusing and meaningless. 
Most persons who have never studied music-in a systematic way are incapable of 
recognizing a theme when it is changed, however slightly. Consequently, when they 
listen to a piece of music, they are like a person who enters a theater in the middle 
of a play and who has no programme and does not know what it is all about. 
These qualities, then, which distinguish great music, which are essential to its 
greatness, must be apprehended by us—we must be instructed in its form and manner 
of speech; then it will educate us. 
We must take it out of the place it now occupies as a parlor accomplishment, or 
as the pleasure of the passing hour, and study it understandingly. Our chief aim 
should be appreciation of the masterpieces of the art. 
* * * * ie" * *   
University extension suggests a right method of dealing with this music question. 
If we can get our audiences to see the value of a musical education, and how much

190 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
that is good and wholesome may be brought into their liyesand the lives of their 
children by cultivating the musical faculty with which they are endowed, we shall 
have carried out the legitimate function of university extension. 
If our colleges, besides teaching harmony and counterpoint to a few students, 
would have courses in analysis in which the form and structure of music is explained, 
and the pieces performed so that an intelligent understanding of them wero possible, 
the amount of real education to be derived from the music courses would be incal- 
eulably increased. As they now stand, they occupy no vital relation to the college 
life and work. 
If wo can convince the people that there is more in music than mere pleasure; if 
we can make them see that their children may all have something of its blessings in 
their lives; if we can substitute for or join with the conventional music lesson a 
study of musical form, an understanding of the way musical ideas are presented, we 
shall be in a fair way to make music a factor in education. 
Music having been raised to the highest degree of perfection by the 
Germans, it would seem proper to inquire into the methods of teaching 
employed in the schools of that country. This inquiry will naturally 
first turn to the history of musical education. The best statement on 
this point is found to have been published by Dr. Johannes Plew, pro- 
fessor in the lyceum in Strasburg, Alsace, Germany. Some results 
of his profound historical researches, as well as those of Prof. J. Helm, 
of Schwabach, are translated here in introducing a sketch of matter 
and method of musical instruction. 
HISTORY OF SINGING IN GERMAN SCHOOLS. 
In the school of the Middle Ages singing was, next to Latin, the most 
important branch. The reason of this is found in the fact that teachers 
and scholars were servants of the church. The church demanded of 
its servant, the school, that it prepare its pupils for singing during 
religious services. How generally this was regarded one of the chief 
objects of the entire instruction may be seen from the fact that Pope 
Gregory I, who is considered the founder of church music, is also revered 
as the patron saint of the school in Catholic countries. But since the 
services of teachers and pupils were required several times a day, and 
also occasionally in civil life, it was not always possible to let the whole 
school participate; and since not all voices were suited for figurate 
counterpoint, differentiation and selection took place, which resulted in 
the establishment of permanent choirs, variously called “chancery 
eurrende” or “symphoniaci.” These choirs were recruited chiefly from 
indigent but highly talented students. In payment of their services as 
choristers they received free tuition and board. <A source of private 
income was offered to singers by performing at all kinds of festive occa- 
sions in private houses. Instrumental music was not known. People 
even danced to the accompaniment of songs. 
The importance given to the instruction in singing in school had, 
however, another reason—one that is often overlooked nowadays. It 
is that music belonged to the liberal arts, and that no student could 
acquire the degree Artium Magister (A. M.) unless he had mastered the
-P-A-G-E-267

art of vocal music. It was the general opinion that no one could bea 
good theologian or a teacher without being a trained musician. Hence 
musical knowledge and skill became a “conditio sine qua non” for 
appointment. All through the sixteenth century this opinion prevailed. 
The great division in the church during that century affected music 
least of all the liberal arts, and if it be remembered that two of the 
greatest musical compositions known, namely, Bach’s High Mass and 
Grell’s Mass in sixteen part music,' that is, two masses for Catholic 
church service, were composed by Protestants during the eighteenth 
and nineteenth centuries, it may be claimed that the great schisnr never 
actually affected the musical domain. Luther, as is well known, desired 
that Catholic church music be retained in the Protestant churches, and 
hence we see that the compositions of the old masters kept their promi- 
nent place in school till far into the nineteenth century. According to 
school regulations in force in 1559, the pupils sang in church “The 
‘Magnificat,’ a hymn corresponding to the pure divine scriptures, a 
‘responsorium;’ on Sundays and minor festivals a ‘Kyrie eleison,’ and 
on high festivals a Christian ‘sequence’ (sic) or ‘ gradual.’” 
Luther also utilized school singing as an essential agency in intro- 
ducing chorus singing of church congregations. School singing was 
not only intended to prepare for participation in congregational sing- 
ing, but also to prepare the choirs for figurate counterpoint, and for 
leading the chorus, for the organ as an accompanying instrument came 
into use much later. 
Musie was not only required for Protestant church service, but for 
the religious instruction of children it was found indispensable, since 
/ hymns and other church music awakened veneration of God in the 
hearts of the young. Luther, making the school the most important 
place, next to the church, for the teaching of the Gospel, considered 
school-singing the highest and most elevating expression of filial piety. 
“School,” he said, “shall be the means to promote the art of music 
and through it the true recognition of God, the Creator and Saviour.” 
Hence, because music had an effect similar to that of theology, as he 
thought, he gave to musical exercises a place next to religious instruc- 
tion. If thus it would appear that Luther valued music only for its 
religious effect, we have evidence of his valuing it as important for 
education in general, and in this he was quite in harmony with the 
views of former times. Numerous expressions of his in confirmation 
of this might be quoted. Two will suffice: 
To keep music in school is a necessity and youth should be kept practicing this 
art, for it makes skillful, genteel people of them. A schoolmaster must be able to 
sing, or I would not recognize him, 
Music is a disciplining mistress that makes people gener: tender-hearted, sweet- 
mannered, and rational.

192 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96, 
The methods of teaching thus far had tended more toward stunting 
than developing the mind. Not a trace in tie schools of that time can 
be found where instruction conformed to the laws of growth. During 
the century marked by the thirty years’ war all promising germs of 
popular education and good tendencies toward the cultivation of the 
people declined. With the close of the war (1648) the desire to live 
and to attend to education and culture returned. According to the 
school regulations of this period, the teaching of singing was compul- 
sory. The most important pedagogical theorist of the seventeenth 
century, Johann Amos Comenius, includes singing in his course of 
study. Inthe eighteenth century, the Pietists made school instruction 
in music successful. Their laying stress upon individual feeling led 
to individualism in all teaching. They had a singular abhorrence to 
wholesale or class instruction, and hence studied and influenced each 
individual pupil. This had its effect upon music in their schools; 
songs adapted for individual feeling, arias, and melodies received the 
most attention. ; 
Methods of teaching greatly improved in the eighteenth century. 
The dull, mechanical singing by rote was set aside in a regular system 
of instruction. Normal schools, though inefficient and imperfect as 
they were at the time, included singing among their studies, and en- 
deavored to make excellent singing masters of their students. In the 
appointment of teachers musical ability was taken into consideration. 
The relatively best standard was attained by the institute of August 
Hermann Francke (1633 to 1727). Boys and girls received two hours’ 
. instruction a week in vocal music. That for the girls was limited to 
the practice of common hymns, while the principles of figurate counter- 
point were taught in the boys’ schools. Instruction in counterpoint 
began with the singing of the diatonic scale represented by letters 
on the lines, and followed by the chromatic scale and exercises in 
intervals. The technical exercises were connected with the singing of 
familiar melodies from notes which were followed by such new melodies 
as required similar notes for their expression in writing. Pupils were 
also taught pauses, tempo, and the different values of notes. The more 
» advanced classes rendered religious airs of two parts in } and 3 time. 
Increased attention was given to singing also in other parts of Ger- 
many during the eighteenth century. The school regulations of Hesse- 
Darmstadt (1733), Brunswick (1753), and Prussia (1794) are explicit on 
this subject. Singing was also advocated by Rochow (1734-1805), who 
urged special attention to church music. Rousseau makes his “Emile” 
cultivate a “pure, even, flexible, pleasing voice,” and an ear for harmony 
and time. A systematic course of musical instruction was likewise 
pursued in the schools of the Philanthropinists, followers and apostles 
of Rousseau in Germany, as in the schools of the Austrian reformer, 
Ignatius von Felbiger (1724-1788). That these well-intended attempts 
‘toward improving instruction in singing brought about few results (for
-P-A-G-E-269

it must be candidly admitted that at the close of the eighteenth cen- 
tury vocal music generally was below par) only proves how difficult it 
is to carry thought and honest efforts into effect, even when they are 
accredited true and just. 
The most important epoch in the history of the development of instruc- 
tion in singing dates from the time of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi 
(1746-1827). Pestalozzi maintained that elementary education “should 
develop and perfect the inborn talents and powers of the human being— 
that is to say, the talents and powers of the mind, the heart, and the 
hand.” For elementary education to attain this end, “observation 
(Anschauung) must be considered the absolute foundation of knowl- 
edge.” By ‘“Anschauung” Pestalozzi understands “the cognizance of 
external objects directly by means of the senses, and the consequent 
action of consciousness through the impressions received.” As a mat- 
ter of course, instances of the visible occur oftenest. Still the ‘simple 
presentation of sounds to the ear and the action of consciousness result- 
ing from the impression received through the sense of hearing is just 
as much perception for the child as the perception of objects through 
the eyes.” 
Likewise, in advancing and originating the proposition, “from per- 
ception to idea,” Pestalozzi maintained induction to be the only method 
conformable to the natural laws of development of a child’s mind, and 
turned the course of instruction into exactly the opposite direction 
from that hitherto pursued. With the inductive method a new and 
broad field was opened to the teaching of singing. The increased 
interest awakened by Pestalozzi for enabling and educating the young 
in Germany benefited instruction in vocal music, too. School authori- 
ties paid greater attention to singing and how it was taught, and pro- 
vided for a better musical education of elementary teachers. The best 
and most prominent men of the nation commended the art of singing 
as one of the most effective means for cultivation and education. That 
precious pearl of German life, the “folks’ song,” which had been forced. 
into the background by church music, gained in importance and was 
looked upon as a valuable object of study. School authorities devoted 
more minute attention to vocal music in their plans of organization; 
the most important, however, was the development of a literature on 
the art of singing and its methods of instruction, which in a compara- 
tively short time made such progress as to promise a rational system 
of instruction for even the most insignificant village school. 
The earliest production of this literature is the Art of Teaching 
Singing, by Pfeiffer and Naegeli. Pestalozzi himself thus commented 
on this work: ‘There is promise in this work of excellent and welcome 
results for the educator and musician alike.” These expectations were 
not realized, principally because Pfeiffer and Naegeli, as well as 
Pestalozzi, saw in music only an accomplishment easily acquired, if 
one had learned a little arithmetic and to measure. This narrow view

of the essence of music led to an overvaluation of thythm and a 
depreciation of melody and harmony. 
The Art of Teaching Singing, by Naegeli, is synthetic throughout. 
The first part, ‘Elementary work,” isin two divisions, general and spe- 
cial theory of music. The first division treats of the duration, pitch, 
and strength of tones, the combination of these three elements, and 
the written characters for tones. Each new chapter is preceded by a 
thorough review of the preceding one. The second division, the spe- 
cial theory, treats of the methodical combination of text and melody. 
Single vowels, then syllables, words, and finally connected sentences, 
are set to tones and combinations of tones. Meter, breathing, analysis 
of text, etc., are taught in connection with the foregoing exercises. 
Written especially for people’s schools, it was just in these schools 
that it could not be used. As excellent as are its details—the chapter 
in notation, for instance, is valuable for all times—as a whole it is too 
comprehensive. Its methodic arrangement, moreover, contradicts Pes- 
talozzi’s “principle of sense-perception,” particularly in that the beauti- 
ful in art in its perfection is withheld from the pupil until he has learned 
all its forms. Rhythm, dynamics, and melodics are, as the words 
betray, not objects perceived directly through the senses, but results 
of thought; in other words, abstracts derived from the production of 
music. A sufficient number of examples of melody and harmony should 
be presented for direct sense-perception before the discussion of scales, 
keys, strength, pitch, and the like is admissible. 
Thus the merits of Naegeli narrowed down to the deep reflections 
which he aroused on the methods to be employed in teaching. 
The demand for a method of instruction in singing which retained 
what had been approved in the works of Naegeli, and which covered 
their deficiencies by better and more practical suggestions, was met by 
B.C. L. Natorp in his instructions for the teaching of singing. Natorp 
also presents his exercises in rhythm, melody, and dynamics separately ; 
and his exercises in rhythm and dynamics are, on the whole, similar to 
‘Naegeli’s; in everything else he and Naegeli differ essentially. The 
latter begins at once with theoretical instruction, whereas Natorp pref: 
aces every lesson with introductory exercises, confined wholly to sing- 
ing by ear. Beginning with single vowels, and proceeding to syllables 
and words, these preparatory exercises were always to be used with 
accompanying text, so as to insure a pure, distinct enunciation, and a 
natural and easy intonation. Texts and combinations of tones should 
betaken from what comes within the compass of a child’s life. Children, 
in this way, acquire an amount of musical material by experience that 
forms the foundation for a later knowledge of the elements of music. 
They have sung and heard many “thirds,” before they are required to 
form the idea of a “third;” and often perceived two and three part 
music through the senses, before they are expected to distinguish the 
difference clearly and distinctly.
-P-A-G-E-271
MUSIC IN GERMAN SCHOOLS. ~ 195 
Another advantage is that Natorp, unlike Naegeli, does not conclude 
the subject of rhythm before proceeding to melody, andsoon. He grades 
the different exercises proceeding from the first grade of rhythm to the 
first grade of melody, and from this to the first grade of dynamics. 
With melody, Natorp for the first time introduces the tones of the 
major chord for understanding and practice, first without, then with 
regard to rhythmic order. The other tones of the diatonic major scale 
follow the tones of the major chord. From here on the instruction con- 
sists altogether of practice. Nothing is offered but songs which con- 
tain elements that have been explained and practiced during the 
preceding lessons. Natorp uses dynamic exercises in combination 
with other elements, or in special lessons combined with melody. He 
uses ciphers as written characters instead of the customary notes. 
Natorp’s book is obscure on the psychological relation between the 
systematic or technical exercises and the songs and melodies learned. 
Nevertheless, the work met with general approval. For several decades 
it, together with Naegeli’s “Art of Teaching,” was considered authori- 
tative on the teaching of singing; it molded the literature on the sub- 
ject. The many text-books that appeared in the second and third 
decades incline either to Natorp or Naegeli. All deal with their sub- 
ject synthetically; none proceeded from songs to study by way of 
analysis, in order to arrive at the elements of melody, rhythm, and 
dynamics. 
Educators in Germany continued to interest themselves in methods 
of singing during the years from 1840 to 1850. Ernst Hentschel 
(musical director and teacher of the normal school in Weissenfels) 
brought about the next and most effectual measures for further improve- 
ment. He found fault that “in some schools pupils scarcely get as far 
as singing songs and hymns, being constantly kept at exercises in 
pitch, tempo, and note reading, ete. In many other schools singing of 
cheerful melodies was persisted in to the utter neglect of the formal 
end to be gained.” Hentschel maintained that “the elementary course 
should combine technical exercises with singing of melodies, for both 
are important. Both should be taught during the entire school course. 
During the first two years, however, the pupils should sing by rote 
only; after that they should be taught altogether from notes.” He 
urged that young children had enough difficulties in mastering the 
symbols of reading (letters) and arithmetic (ciphers). An 8-year old 
child might begin another set of symbols, the musical notes. 
Hentschel’s claims were soon admitted, and received full considera- 
tion in the ‘“ Course of study in singing for people’s schools” by Fried- 
rich Wilhelm Schuetze. He proceeded from the fundamental thought 
that ‘a child first receives the impression of an object in its entirety; 
after which it analyzes its individuality and examines the different 
parts severally.” “Musical education, therefore, progresses conform- 
ably to natural law, if, as soon as sound becomes perceptible to a child,
-P-A-G-E-272
196 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
repeated single tones, a succession of tones, sounds in rhythmic form, 
or, aS Should oftenest be the case, real musical compositions are pre- 
sented to it, and it is thus first of all brought into contact with the 
world of sound.” Consequently, ‘‘ children must first become familiar 
with musical language in learning to sing by ear,” and “ subsequently 
in singing from written characters.” 
The valuation set by Hentschel upon songs as essential material for 
instruction in the theory, which valuation has remained unchanged to 
the present day, created the demand for suitable collections of songs. 
This demand was speedily supplied, and continues to act as a stimulus 
to composers. Though it is a lasting honor for Hentschel to have 
assigned the proper place for songs in the course for people’s or ele- 
mentary schools, and to have pointed out their educational value, it is 
still claimed that the complete banishment of the technical exercises 
from the primary school is a mistake, because it breaks the uniform 
connection of instruction. During the last ten years authorities in the 
method of singing, almost without exception, have decided upon the 
union of both. Hentschel himself modified his first opinion. As a 
rule songs are so combined with the elementary exercises that a greater 
or smaller number of exercises are directly supplemented by songs and 
hymns, the melodic and rhythmic construction of which embodies the 
elements of the preceding exercises, The only difference is that some 
lay the greater stress on the exercises, while others attach greater 
importance to the songs, to which the technical exercises are consid- 
ered secondary. This naturally depends upon the musical education 
of the individual teacher. 
To the text-books which make songs the living center of instruction 
belongs among others the “Theoretical and practical singing school,” 
by Johann Rudolph Weber. This book advocates that the teaching of 
singing should be nothing more than “instruction which helps pupils 
on to songs.” ‘The singing of songs and technical instruction in sing- 
ing should be combined and support each other.” ‘In every grade, the 
essential material of the organic (elementary) exercises consists of the 
elements of songs to be practiced and learned by heart, because to these 
as an entity in art the exercises are most easily applied.” “Instruction 
must show the pupil how to perceive and recognize sounds severally in 
regard to time, tone, and volume.” All the material for singing must 
be made “elementary.” The simplest element, rhythm, forms the begin- 
ning. In connection with melodies the pupil becomes acquainted with 
major and minor chords, the chord of the dominant seventh, as well as 
with the foundation of all melodies, the major scales. 
Departing from custom, J. G. F. Pflueger has adopted an analytic- 
synthetic method in his “Introduction to the teaching of singing in 
schools.” After several introductory exercises, consisting of children’s 
songs, the text and melody of which must be learned by ear, he develops 
the theory for the holding of tones, for pitch and volume, and the ideas
-P-A-G-E-273
MUSIC IN GERMAN SCHOOLS. 197 
of scales, time, chords, and pauses; his lessons on notes, intervals, and 
the most familiar major and minor scales are directly connected with 
the preceding songs and hymns. 
Pflueger advocates the method of induction, proceeding from simple 
tones and combinations of tones to the chief elements of music. , 
A warm interest is being shown at present in singing and in the 
instruction of vocal music. A number of practical educators are 
assiduous in their efforts so to plan instruction in singing in people’s 
schools that it must lead to favorable results. Psychology and peda- 
gogy suggest the principles for the perfection of methods. 
(1) Instruction in singing must not be isolated; by means of song texts it must 
be kept in touch with other subjects. 
(2) The concrete material for instruction in singing in sacred and national hymns 
and those peculiarly popular songs which in Germany for a long period of years 
have proved to be a real production of art. 
(3) All technical exercises should proceed from songs and lead back to them; the 
elements for comparison in the process of abstraction should be taken from the melo- 
dies practiced. 
(4) Symbols of tones, be they notes, ciphers, or letters, should be nothing more to 
the pupil than visible signs and forms for the special sensations of sounds. The eye 
should only support the ear. 
PRESENT STATE OF METHOD IN GERMANY. 
Dr. G. A. Lindner, in his Cyclopedia of Education, sketches the 
present state of method in teaching school singing in Germany. His 
sketch is here presented in translation: 
In modern times instruction in singing has become an integral part of the course 
of study in common schools, because it is generally recognized that it forms the taste, 
ennobles the emotions, and proves to be also a good means of discipline, since it 
concentrates the attention and forms a means which will unite many into a com- 
munity. The object of this instruction is to awaken a sense of melody, to promote 
the «xsthetic and emotional training of children, and to stimulate patriotism. 
In singingwe recognize three elements: (1) the melodic, which refers to the pitch of 
tone; (2) the rhythmic, which refers to the duration of tone; (3) the dynamic, which 
refers to the strength and volume of tone and also to correct expression. Melody 
gives life to the song, rhythm gives regularity, and expression causes impression. 
These three elements must be considered by the singing teacher. It will not do, of 
course, to treat the one element exclusively until all necessary information is given 
and then take up the next, but the essentials of each of the three elements are to be 
given, which are then followed by more difficult work; but whatever song is taken 
up, it is first the melodic, then the rhythmic, and, lastly, the dynamic element which 
must be considered. In other words, first the melody is taught, then the proper 
time, and, lastly, the expression by means of variations in the volume of tone. For 
the common school the melody is not only the most essential, but almost the exclus- 
ive element, for tempo and expression are subject to individual preferences and 
emotional conditions. 
Concerning the method and the course of study for lessons in singing in the public 
schools, the following points may be considered to have found general approbation 
inGermany. During the first two years of school, singing is practiced by rote. The 
chief object here is the development of the voice and the musical ear; later on 
instruction is based upon the foundation of reading music. It is generally conceded
-P-A-G-E-274
  198 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
best to confine the children’s knowledge to one key, making the Do movable as occa- 
sion requires. In German schools a number of popular songs of interest to children, 
both with reference to text and melody, are firmly memorized and frequently prac- 
ticed. Above all, it has been found necessary to begin the singing of pleasant, catchy 
airs quite early, so that the musical ear be trained, and since Germans, as a rule, are 
very musical, it is found that mothers and nurse girls work hand in hand with the 
school teacher. 
A second and higher step in the singing lessons is singing from notes. The pupil 
is introduced into the laws and symbols of the art of music. A song which he has 
learned by rote is analyzed into its elements, and the elements thus obtained are 
reduced to the scale, sharps and flats are introduced, and the various keys developed. 
Instruction in singing from notes should not be neglected, because the subsequent 
musical training of the pupil makes it very desirable that he have knowledge of 
music. Methodical instruction in singing by means of which the pupil obtains a 
clear consciousness of the intervals, time, etc., is not possible without the ability to 
read music. Moreover, in practicing songs of two, three, and four parts, it would 
be exceedingly tedious to learn the several parts by ear only, since the accompany- 
ing parts rarely carry melody, and thus will allure those who cannot read music to 
sing the treble “‘unisono.” The success of any instruction in singing, however, lies 
not in the skillful reading of music, but in the production of melody ; in other words, 
not in the notes, but in the tones. It is therefore very essential that the teacher 
should sing, or that he play a musical instrument, and thus make his pupils hear the 
tones which they are to sing. 
In the lower grades of the school the greatest simplicity is the 5 pistes art. In 
the selection of songs much care, taste, and tact are required. Cheerful, joyous 
songs are to be preferred, especially when they have somo reference to nature and 
the seasons; also patriotic songs, and airs which express general human sentiments, 
such as popular airs. In the selection of these songs the scope of the voices of 
children must be considered. In schools where music is read, the various symbols 
or signatures are to be considered in class before the melody of the song is taken 
up. In order to secure firmness and skill in singing, songs that have been learned 
should be frequently practiced in class, especially if they are sung in two or threo 
parts, because the musical ear, while very faithful to melody, is less efficient in 
retaining accompaniments. 
The National Teachers’ Association of Germany, in its meeting of 
1879, passed a number of resolutions, a declaration of principles, as 
it were, concerning the instruction in music in the elementary schools. 
These theses deserve to be translated and reproduced here, since they 
express the theory and method followed generally in German schools. 
(1) School should educate and instruct for life; hence for the instruction in music 
the same principle should prevail. 
(2) School instruction in singing should, first of all, nurse German popular songs 
(Volkslieder). 
(3) Artistic results can not be expected and must not be demanded, but an aspira- 
tion for musical perfection should be awakened in the pupils. 
(4) No songs should be taught and practiced which are not of undoubted poetic 
~ and musical value. 
(5) In the teaching of even the simplest popular song the object must be to express 
that which poet and composer intended. The technique is not to be an aim but a 
means. 
© (6) Music is not only to create pleasure in melody and harmony, but must have an 
ennobling effect upon the heart. 
he (7) Pedagogical treatment in music lessons presupposes a teacher who is profes- 
sionally prepared and skilled in the art of music. 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
MUSIC IN GERMAN SCHOOLS. s 199 
(8) The education of the German nation by means of music and through music 
has a national significance. 
(9) Singing should be taught in every school, not in lessons after school hours, 
but during school sessions. 
(10) Instruction in singing should be given with the aid of a musical instrument, 
be that the violin, piano, or organ, and such instruction can be successful only when 
the teacher is well trained in the use of his instrument. 
(11) Every normal school should have an experienced singing teacher, who has 
been well trained both in music and pedagogy, is acquainted with the methods of 
composition, and understands the value of popular airs and hymns. 
(12) It is the duty of school authorities to see to it that in every schoolhouse at 
least one teacher be engaged who is trained in music. 
(13) No pupil shall be excused from taking part in singing lessons. 
(14) Exercises in reading music should be a part of every singing lesson all 
through the course. 
(15) As to the matter of instruction, popular airs (Volkslieder) and hymns should 
be preferred in elementary schools. 
(16) Only such songs should be practiced whose texts express noble, refining sen- 
timents. The texts must be brought to the comprehension of the pupils before 
they are memorized. 
(17) Punishment should rarely be administered during singing lessons, corporal 
punishment never. 
(18) Lessons in singing are most suitably reserved for the last hour of the forenoon. 
or afternoon, since they serve as recreation after severe mental work. 
SELECTION AND ARRANGEMENT OF MATTER. 
Mr. J. Helm, of Schwabach, Bavaria, Germany, an authority on 
school singing and methods of teaching, says with reference to the 
proper selection of songs that it is defined by the educational signifi- 
cance of singing and also by the position it occupies within the system — 
of education. A translation of his opinion on this subject seems 
desirable, and is here inserted: 
The beautiful is the sister of the good. The contemplation of the beautiful awak- 
ens a feeling of satisfaction similar to the contemplation of the good. Aisthetic 
enjoyments elevate and idealize; they belong to the highest pleasures of life. Though 
moral education is the highest of all human education, the cultivation of taste 
and artistic schooling aro by no means superfluous. Occupation with art refines the 
mind, ennobles the emotions, and makes the individual more sensitive to the highest, 
which is moral beauty. Within the wide compass of art, music, next to poetry, can 
be brought within easy reach of the young, and within the extensive domain of 
music nothing is better adapted for class instruction than singing. The combina- 
tions of tones which instruction in singing presents to the ear excite involuntary 
pleasure in the pupil, and offer him elements for his ideas of the beautiful. 
Singing delights the human heart and enlivens and animates the emotions. It is 
the language of feeling, the expression for pleasure and sorrow. Thero is no purer 
or more productive source of pleasure, and no nobler or more beautiful form of 
expression for the feelings than song. Singing combines melodic, dynamic, rhyth- 
mic, and text elements in such perfect symmetry, and so smooths contradictions and 
restraints by harmonic combinations that nothing else can provoke greater msthetic 
pleasure. If technically correct relations and combinations of tones are often brought 
to bear upon the pupil’s mind, more agreeable feelings will predominate to the prob- 
able development of a bright and cheerful disposition. The latter factor, however, - 
is one of the most important presuppositions for the development of the interest and
-P-A-G-E-276
200 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
the education of the will. Singing and the art of music should therefore not be 
withheld from the young. 
However great the pedagogical value of instruction in singing may be estimated, 
it can not be admitted that it follows musical laws exclusively, or satisfies its own 
demands alone. Consideration for the general aim of educational factors makes it 
necessary for instruction in singing to keep in touch with other studies. Its texts 
make this possible. Instruction can be purely musical only with reference to melody, 
rhythm, and dynamics, while with reference to the text it must consult the sentiments 
expressed as well as the special claims of school life. Where this rule is observed, 
the songs to be practiced are adapted to feelings and moods of the pupils awakened 
by preceding lessons. They are then received with more interest, sung with greater 
feeling, and a deeper meaning is attached to their study. A lasting disposition of 
mind can be awakened by instruction only when the subject treated, to which inter- 
est is attached, is of such a nature that it appears of value not only to the child but 
also to the adult. 
The greatest attention must therefore be paid to the selection of texts. Only such 
songs should be chosen in which text and melody are esthetic, and have been proved 
to be productions of true poetical and musical art. Moreover, texts and melodies 
should be in proportioned relation to individuality of mind and vocal organ; other- 
wise songs can never become flesh and blood, so to speak; or, as the psychologist 
has it, can never be apperceived by children. 
If these claims are justified, the elementary schools must abandon all attempts at 
presenting and studying complicated works, as well as songs of four parts, as they 
are above the capacity of the pupils. They must also set aside all songs specially 
composed and set to music for ‘‘school purposes,” because they are seldom poetic in 
thought or musical in form, and, as a rule, rarely meet the requirements of a noble 
art. Moralizing songs must likewise be omitted, since they never originate in a 
healthy, strong, or vigorous sensibility, and therefore soon become distasteful to 
children. The source upon which instruction for people’s schools should draw, can 
and must be no other than the national song, sacred or profane (secular). 
“National songs are irreproachable music of God’s grace; their author and con- 
tents are everywhere and at all times the same—the nation itself and the spirit of 
national life embodied in song. Whatever events excite national feeling, whatever 
affects the heart of the people, or is treasured in its mind in thoughtful moods, forms 
the inexhaustible contents of its songs and life.”—-(A. B. Marx.) The architecture of 
the national song is so transparent and so simple, the glorified deeds and events cele- 
brated appear so plastic to the eye in their poetic garb, that it seems highly adapted 
to a child’s perception; it is besides an inexhaustible spring of «esthetic and moral 
pleasure, truly classic in form and content, and never losing its magnetic force and 
its vivifying and refreshing charm for the mind. 
Only those national songs (which term includes some of our church hymns) should 
. be accepted as suitable for elementary schools which in the course of time have been 
permanently appropriated by the people, and have entered abidingly into mind and 
heart. 
The sacred church hymn must be sung and studied in its original form, which is 
rhythmic. Melody, rhythm, and text are the essential elements of every song, and 
can not be separated without offending a cultivated ear. They exert a beneficial 
influence on taste and excite «esthetic pleasure only when they cooperate and leave 
the impression of mutuality. The movement and complexity of the rhythmic hymn 
is conformable to musical law, and therefore uniform; the restfulness and sameness 
of the hymn without meter and proper tempo end in a monotony calculated neither 
to thrill nor to animate. The hymn without rhythm dates from the time in which 
the life of the church and religious feeling had degenerated, and therefore can never 
be considered the result of a healthy, historical development. It is the consequence 
of religious indifference, and an idle self-relinquishment. That the rhythmic hymn 
is not above the ability and comprehension of the pupils in elementary schools is 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
MUSIC IN GERMAN SCHOOLS. 201 
sufficiently proved by the fact that many of our national songs, as they are sung in 
schools, display as great a diversity in rhythmic forms and as much interchange of 
accentuated and quantitative rhythm as the rhythmic hymn. The fact that church 
congregations in a large part of the Empire observe the rules of rhythm in their 
singing goes to prove that no insurmountable obstacle prevents its adoption in the 
course of school singing. 
Material for instruction in singing may be divided into the poetical and the musi- 
eal. The poetical half, the texts of songs, should be derived from object and lan- 
guage lessons. These studies should be so arranged that before a child begins to 
learn the singing of a song it has already become acquainted with the form and con- 
tents of the text. Where instruction in singing has not received this consideration, 
it must analyze the text. A systematic acquisition of the text by the mind of the 
pupils—not mere thoughtless memorizing—must under all circumstances be insisted 
upon, Neither in language nor in singing lessons should an incomprehensible jumble 
of mere words be permitted. 
The chief duty of instruction in singing is to give out the melody, and in sucha 
way that the pupils not only understand it, but are capable of repeating it with 
technical correctness. Involuntary pleasure on the part of the pupil created by the 
melody is to be developed gradually to esthetic pleasure based upon comprehension. 
This is possible only when the pupils are made to understand the technique of music¢ 
in an elementary way. Hence it will not suffice to teach by rote songs of one and 
two parts, but the elements of melodics, dynamics, and rhythm must be taught, 
supplemented, perhaps, by the barest elements of harmony. 
DETAILS OF THE AMERICAN METHOD OF TEACHING SINGING. 
Before the very successful mode of teaching singing in German 
schools is presented in detail it may be well to quote an American 
opinion on this subject. Dr. Edward Brooks, superintendent of public 
schools of Philadelphia, in a special report to the board of education 
of that city described the methods in vogue in America. This report, 
by showing how singing is taught in some cities, incidentally bears 
witness to the advanced state of method in this country. The author 
says: 
Two distinct systems of reading vocal music have been current among musicians 
and have divided the judgment of the musical world. These twosystems have each 
intelligent and earnest advocates, and it is therefore necessary to compare their 
merits and reach a conclusion as to which one is best suited to the work of the 
elementary schools. 
The method of staff intervals —The old system, which may be called the Italian 
system, taught singers to read music by the intervals of the staff, somewhat as in 
playing an instrument. The intervals between the lines and spaces in the natural 
key were learned and readily applied to music written in this key. In the different 
keys the intervals were determined by the flats and sharps of the signature, and 
these intervals were sung without regard to the key in which the music was written. 
Music was conceived as made up, not of scale intervals, but of a succession of tones 
without any relation to the tonic of the scale in which the music was written. That 
the method presented great difficulties is shown by the fact that comparatively few 
persons taught by this method ever became ready readers of music by sight. Most 
of them required the use of an instrument to learn new pieces, and many singers 
read music through the instrument which they played, imagining how it would 
sound upon the instrument. In this system, when the syllables do, re, mi, ete., 
were used, these syllables were fixed for the natural key and remained stationary 
throughout all the different keys, the system being known as that of the ‘fixed do,” 
ED 96——7* 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  202 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
This system has been advocated by many of the leading musicians of this country 
and of Europe. This advocacy is not unnatural or surprising, as most of these musi- 
cians are instrumentalists, and the instrumentalist does not necessarily think of bis 
seale or key note; he sees the note and touches the key or string which corresponds 
to it on his instrument, sharping or flatting in accordance with the signature of the 
key. He plays, or may play, entirely unconscious of scale relations, thinking only 
of the note on the staff or upon his instrument. It is entirely natural, therefore, 
that he should regard a method of singing by means of a movable scale as unneces- 
sary and inconvenient. Especially if the syllables do, re, mi, etc., are used, does it 
seem to him not only inconvenient but absurd to change the position of these sylla- 
bles for the different keys in which the music may bo written. 
This system of singing by staff or tone intervals is the one that has been generally 
used by those who train to artistic singing. The object in this instruction is not 
“sight singing,” but vocal culture and the artistic use of the voice. Such singers 
are seldom ready readers of music; they depend on the instrument to give them the 
tune, their aim being the beautiful and artistic rendering of the music. Even the 
great singers like Patti are said to be very poor or indifferent readers of music, their 
dependence being upon the instrument in learning anew score. These facts demand 
our attention, so that the popularity of this method among so many eminent musi- 
cians may be clearly understood and properly estimated. The advocates of the 
_method are largely instrumentalists and have not been interested in sight reading 
of a vocal score; or, when they were teachers of singing, the object was not to make 
independent readers of music, but artistic performers. ‘Their views upon the subject 
are thus not only natural, but, under the circumstances, entirely reasonable. 
The method of scale intervals.—The second method of reading music is that of scale 
intervals and the movable scale, This method does not think of musical sounds as 
intervals upon the staff or as abstract tone intervals, but as degrees of the scale in 
their relation to one another and to the tonic. The scale is regarded as a musical 
unit of thought, and each tone is considered or conceived in relation to this unit. 
The mind thus thinks music through scale relations, conceiving a tone as the second, 
third, fourth, ete., of the scale. The course of instruction begins with drilling the 
pupil upon the major scale of cight notes until he has mastered it and its intervals. 
These intervals are learned in relation to the fundamental note of the scale as well 
as in relation to one another. Having mastered this scale, which is purely a vocal 
exercise, the pupil is taught how to represent it on the staff in what is called the 
natural key. He is then drilled in reading by the degrees of the scale until he can 
tell at a glance the position in the scale which any note upon the staff indicates. 
Knowing the sound of the different tones of the scale, he can then readily read any 
score of the major scale in the natural key set before him. 
He is then taught the use of flats and sharps and drilled upon the simpler inter- 
vals of the chromatic scale. The next step is to show how these flats and sharps, 
placed upon certain degrees of the staff, give a scale beginning on some other degree 
of the staff than C. For example, he learns that with the signature of F sharp the 
scale starts on G, with the signature of F' sharp and C sharp the scale begins on D, ete. 
He is then drilled upon reading in the different keys, naming successively the degree 
of the scale indicated by the notes, reckoning from the location of the tonic, precisely 
as he did in the natural key of C. 
In all this work ho reads and sings not by staff intervals or tonic relations, but by 
scale intervals. In looking at a new score he looks at the signature, determines the 
place of the keynote or tonic, and counts the degree of the scale from that place of 
the keynote. He does not think of J’sharp or B flat, etc., but of the degree of the 
scale which the note represents. Thus in the first two or three measures of ‘Home, 
sweet home,” no matter in what key it may be written, his thought would be one, 
three, four, six, five, three, five, four, three, four, two, three; or if he uses the syllables 
which are often employed to designate the degrees of the scale, he thinks do, mi, fa, 
la, sol, mi, sol, fa, mi, fa, re, mi.

This method, it will be seen, is entirely different from that of tone or staff rela- 
tions; it is based upon the musical scale and conceives of the different notes of the 
melody in their relations to the scale, If the syllables do, re, mi, etc., are used, do 
is always the first of the scale, mi the third, sol the fifth, etc. If the scale begins on 
C, then a note on C is called do; if the scale begins on J’, as in the key of one flat, 
then a note on F is called do, a note on A is called mi, etc. The do thus naming the 
first degree of tho scale is moved with the movable scale, from which the system has 
been called that of the “movable do.” 
The difference between the two methods may be illustrated by the reading of the 
following exercise: 
[Aor Sales PSS tet eal S| ee   
  
  
    
    
  
    
By the method of scale relations and the moyable scale this would be read as 
follows: One-three | five-three | four-six | five || five-six |.four-seven | two-one | 
five || five-one | seven-four | three-two | one || . 
By the method of tonic or staff relations one would think and read as follows: E)-G, 
a major 3d | By, a minor 3d-G, a minor 3d | Ap, a minor 2d-C, a major 3d | B, a major 
2d | By-C, a major 2d | Ay, a minor 3d-D,, an extended 4th | F, a minor3d-E), a major 
2d | By, 2 4th || By-E,, a 5th | D, a minor 2d-A;, « diminished 5th | G, a minor 2d-F, 
a major 2d | Ep, a major 2d ||. 
Ihave merely named the intervals between successive notes, without indicating 
whether they are ascending or descending. It will be noticed that in reading by 
the method of tonic intervals one must distinguish between major and minor sec- 
onds, major and minor thirds, perfect, augmented, and diminished fourths; perfect, . 
augmented, and diminished fifths, etc.,a thing not difficult for the accomplished 
musician who is familiar with an instrument, but exceedingly difficult for the ordi- 
nary reader of vocal scores. By the method of scale relations these intervals pre- 
sent no difficulties to the singer. 
‘The method of the movable scale, as stated above, is usually known as that of the 
“movable do.” This name does not characterize it fully, however, as the method of 
scale relations may be employed without the use of the syllables do, re, mi, in which 
case of course there is no do to be moved. While it is believed that there are advan- 
tages in using these syllables with beginners to indicate the different degrees of the 
scale, yet many good teachers of the method of scale relations use other syllables, as 
la or ta, for all the degrees of the scale. Tho essential nature of the method is not 
indicated by the use of the syllables; it consists in the conception of sounds in 
respect to their relations to the scale, this scale being moved on the staff as indi- 
cated by the signature of the key in which the music is written. 
These two methods have been and to a limited extent are still competitive for 
public favor. While both have strong and intelligent advocates, the tide of opin- 
ion is now setting strongly in favor of the “movable scale” system. This is the 
method that is generally used in the elementary schools of Switzerland and Ger- 
many. ‘In France the same system is gaining ground under the name of the Cheve 
method, which is so well represented in this city by Professor Zobanaky. In England 
the old system was found so difficult that in order to simplify the work of popular 
musical instruction they dropped not only the staff relations but tho staff itself, 
giving rise to Mr. Curwen’s method, known as the ‘‘tonic sol-fa system.” The 
method of the movable scale was introduced into the United States largely through 
the influence of Dr. Lowell Mason, one of the most accomplished Pestalozzian 
instructors that this country hes produced. The widespread introduction of musical 
instruction in the public schools of the United States is largely an inheritance from 
and an outgrowth of the labors of Dr. Lowell Mason. 
The tonic sol-fa method.—In this discussion a passing word should be said in respect   
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  204 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
to the tonic sol-fa system. This method originated with a Miss Glover, of Norwich, 
England, but is generally credited to Rey. John Curwen, through whose influence it 
has been so widely introduced. The method is based on scale relations, and there- 
fore in pure musical conception agrees with the method of scale relations already 
described. It differs in the representation of music to the eye, introducing an 
entirely different notation from the one in general use. This notation is simple and 
readily learned by the pupil; and it is this simplicity, especially as contrasted with 
the method of intervals, which has given it so large a degree of popularity. The 
objection to the method is that it does not present a universal musical language or 
one that can ever become universal. Modern instrumental music would be impossible 
by this system. A person when taught to sing by this method must afterwards learn 
the generally accepted notation, or be restricted to a very limited number of musical 
compositions. The present mode of writing music has been accepted by the musi- 
cians of every country; and a person taught only by the tonic sol-fa method would 
be unable to read the simplest score written in the common notation. The method 
is, however, extensively used in England and Canada, and is widely recommended 
and strongly indorsed ‘by some of the leading musicians and educators of both 
Europe and America. It is especially commended as an introduction to the staff 
notation. This reference to the method is not designed as a recommendation of its 
introduction into the elementary schools, but is merely given because in the discus- 
sion of systems this is too conspicuous not to receive a passing notice. Even if it 
were thought best to use it in teaching the elements of music to little children, it 
should be regarded merely as a stepping-stone to the generally accepted system of 
musical notation. 
In the introduction of music into the public schools of the city it is necessary to 
decide upon the merits of the two principal systems described and to determine 
which one should be adopted. My own judgment, based on a wide observation and 
the experience of several years in early life in teaching music, is strongly biased in 
favor of the method of scale relations and the movable scale. Children, even those 
who have not much natural ability for music, can be readily taught by this method 
to read music by sight. The other method presents far greater difficulties to the 
learner, and is entirely unsatisfactory for use in the elementary schools. The argu- 
ments in favor of the method of scale relations and the movable scale seem to me to be 
conclusive. The method is simple and logical and in accordance with the essential 
principles of the art of music. The unit of the system is the scale, which is the 
foundation of all musical compositions, Each tone of the scale has its relation to 
the tonic and should be so conceived. When the key is changed, and thus the posi- 
tion of the scale upon the staff is changed, the relations of the tones to the keynote 
are always the same; the scale is simply started from another pitch indicated by 
another degree of the staff. Furthermore, all work in harmony is based on the scale 
rather than the staff relations; the chord of the tonic, the dominant, the subdomi- 
nant, etc., are all conceived in scale relations as these expressions indicate. Indeed, 
it seems almost impossible for anyone to have an intelligent idea of cither melody or 
harmony without thinking of them in their relations to the musical scale. 
The foregoing description of Dr. Brooks is inserted because it will 
aid us in understanding the subsequent statement by Prof. J. Helm of 
the details of the method in vogue in elementary schools in Germany, 
which is offered in translation: 
DETAILS OF THE GERMAN METHOD OF TEACHING SINGING. 
It will be generally conceded that teaching singing in school has a double purpose 
in view, the acquisition of a number of songs and knowledge of the elements of 
music. In regard to the place songs are to occupy in the method, opinions differ as 
much as they do in regard to the understanding and presentation of the relation 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
MUSIC IN GERMAN SCHOOLS. 205 
which elementary technical exercises are to maintain to the songs. However, one 
thing seems to be decided. For the purpose of imparting knowledge of the musical 
system, authorities on the method of singing have during the last ten years decided 
upon the organic combiaation of exercises with songs. As a rule this combination 
is effected by connecting a number of elementary exercises from the beginning with 
songs and hymns in the melodie and rhythmic construction of which the elements 
of the preceding exercises are applied. A difference of opinion exists in that some 
lay the greater stress on the elementary exercises to precede the song, while others 
give the preference to songs as a starting point. Pflueger and Reissmann propose a 
different method. They suggest that the technical exercises depend entirely upon 
the elements of music found in the-songs. Anything of musical notation, ete., not 
found in the songs presented to the children should not be taught. ‘Climb the hill 
when you get toit.” Dornstedt maintains that as botanical knowledge is gained. 
by the observation of single plants and parts of plants, geographical knowledge by 
the observation of the earth, by the study of relief maps and flat-surfaced maps and 
apparatus, and a knowledge of language by the study of classic extracts in prose 
and verse, so all musical knowledge should be gained from the study of songs and 
their notation. All technical exercises should be derived from simple songs and their 
analysis into the melodic and rhythmic elements. Regard for the pupils’ interest 
alone can decide the method. 
A tone in itself is no more calculated to arouse a child’s interest than a separate 
letter or single sound. Pleasure is involuntarily excited by a natural, and, at the 
same time, technical combination of tones only. The compass of musical thought, 
too, is enlarged only by combinations of tones. The musical judgment of the pupil, 
in other words, his comprehension of the musical system, should be developed by 
the study of combinations of tones sthetical in every sense. Interest is aroused 
by the concrete; the abstract in itself is not interesting. Consequently, the ele- 
ments of melody, dynamics, rhythm, and probably musical notation are of direct 
interest to the pupil only when they rest upon a concrete foundation of songs. For 
this reason the technical course should depend upon songs, and with,a few incidental 
exceptions, the systematic instruction of singing should ever proceed from songs 
and lead back to them. 
Though detached from the melody the technical exercise may reduce the elements 
of songs to single tones and intervals, they yet appear to the pupil as parts of a 
whole which it has learned to like. It is this which assures the interest and atten- 
tion of children, The objection can not be made that an “‘analytic consideration” . 
of a song robs it of poetic form and artistic character, as the song itself is not the 
object of systematic instruction, but is only used as a starting point and to furnish 
rhythmic and tonic elements. Truly systematic instruction can only be given after 
the pupil has learned a number of songs; singing in elementary schools should there- 
fore begin with songs. The only question is whether 6 and 7 year old children are 
capable of comprehending and reproducing easy songs without having practiced 
preparatory exercises. I believe that experience has found it to be so. Children2 
and 3 years of age are able to repeat short songs, which they hear at home, quite 
- correctly with reference to tone andrhythm. And what the family and kindergarten 
can accomplish is certainly possible in the lower classes of elementary schools. It 
stands to reason that great versatility and thoroughness can not be required of 
children. The very name of the “elementary” school precludes that. 
A child knows the difference among a hundred trees and shrubs before it is 
expected to distinguish typical leaf forms. The first is in reality easier, although a 
tree is far more complex than a leaf. It is much more difficult for the uncultivated 
ear of a child to detect intervals when they are isolated than when they occur in 
the phrases of asong. The clearness of any idea, and hence that of a distinct idea 
of sound, depends not only upon the light and distinctness which the idea itself pos- 
sesses, but also upon that which it receives from combinations with and relations to 
other ideas that throw light on it from many sides. Thus a pupil is more easily 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  
  206 ' EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
impressed with the methodic succession of tones in a chord when it is studied asa 
part of a phrase in song than when it is presented as a separate chord. It would 
not be impossible to begin the teaching of singing in elementary schools, and con- 
tinue it correlatively with the subsequent technical course in sucha way that 
the separate exercises may prepare for the reading and singing of new songs, and 
these again apply to thoso exercises from which the technical work of musical 
instruction must be abstracted or derived. 
Hearing is the scnse of music. The deaf are incapable of musical education. 
Ideas of music can not be gained through any other sense than that of hearing; but 
as the idea of an object becomes clearer and livelier in the mind it can be more 
_ easily retained if the object has been presented to the mind simultaneously, or in 
direct sequence, through move than one sense; thus other organs of sense are a help 
to the ear;. in other words, impressions of sound are clearer and more easily repro- 
duced when combined with other impressions. This is the psychological reason for 
“using characters to represent sound in the teaching of singing, motions of the hand 
and other gestures to indicate height or depth of tone, intervals, ete. It necessarily 
follows that the symbols used, be they figures, letters, or notes, can be no more than 
visible signs for definite sensations of sound. The eye can only support the ear, 
never take its place. 
As with all objects of ideation, so with music. We distinguish between ideas 
belonging to immediate knowledge and originated by perception through the senso 
of hearing and ideas that form a part of mediate knowledge and are originated by 
reason. Symbols are required for both kinds of musical ideas. . The ideas gained 
by immediate perception and apprehension are defined in the genesis of sensations 
of sound, 
The matter for hearing is sound, in the same sense that color is a matter for sight. 
Every sound is produced by the impulse and vibrations of elastic bodies. These 
impulses and vibrations are communicated first to the air surrounding the oscillating 
bodies; their motion to and fro displaces the particles of air, thus causing conden- 
sation on the one side and rarefaction or expansion on the other. Thus the stratum 
of air surrounding the vibrating body alternately condenses and expands, producing 
a wave-like motion which extends to all sides.. If these waves reach the tympanum 
of the ear they impart to it, to the air confined in the drum, and to the four small 
bones their vibrating motion, which continues to the labyrinth and the nerve fibers 
of the cortical organ. This causes an excitement of the nerves which, as soon as it 
is perceived by the mind, is recognized as a sensation of sound. If the vibrations 
of the elastic body and the air waves have been regular—that is, repeated in equal 
periods of time and in the same manner—we call the sensation a musical sound. 
Every impression of sound bears an adequate relation to the air waves by which if 
was produced. Consequently, there are just as many kinds of sensations of sound as 
there are kinds of air waves. According to present investigations, the nervo fibers 
of the ear seem to possess in groups a limited specific sensibility for similarly limited 
groups of sound waves. The differing in groups of this sensibility of the nerve 
fibers of the ear has, as a consequence, that every tone quality is actually represented 
to us simultaneously by a sum of quantitively similar sensations which collectively 
are apprehended only as a more forcible single concept. But if two kinds of sound 
or air waves strike the ear, they produce two sensations of different quality, which at 
first, like other sensations simultaneously presented, leave a single impression; 
‘subsequently, however, when the mind has developed sufficiently for discerning 
between them, the distinction affords a criterion for further judgment. If we try 
to reduce the qualities of sound, like those of color, in a comprehensive scheme, all 
noises, namely, those sensations of sound which are produced by irregular vibrations 
and are capable of no qualitative fixation and comparison, must be omitted. 
Every sound sensation, called musical tone, progresses in two opposite directions. 
If we continue this progression for any great length, we have a straight line that 
extends infinitely in both directions, but in which every sensation of sound, by 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
  MUSIC. IN GERMAN SCHOOLS. 207 
reason of its quality, has a distinct place; that is to say, is assigned to a definite 
height or depth. This line should really be conceived as a continuity without break 
or demarcation of single points. Still, in the scale empirically presented, we find 
single points separated and defined by specialnames. These points—absolute tones— 
form the elements of our inusical system. They are likewise the foundation of all 
empiric musical knowledge. 
‘Though we are not able so to perceive and retain all of the sensations of sound 
unlimited in both directions of the line as to recognize in them a part of immediate 
knowledge, it certainly is possible to make clear to our consciousness the aboye- , 
mentioned points of the line, when they are presented again and again at the same 
height. After alittle practice, we can easily perceive them, and do not confuse 
them with other sensations. We easily succeed in ihis, if we call upon the eye 
to help the ear, and if we fix the marked points of the series of sensations of sound 
in the scales in writing. A definite sensation of sound and a definite sensation of 
sight are, then, associated; but itis always presupposed, as a most essential condi- 
tion, that the tone which is fixed by a special name and symbol must invariably be 
presented at the same height. If this is the case, these tones, in which we see the 
elements of the musical system and the perceivable material for practical music, 
gradually become more clearly distinct from the combinations and series of sound 
sensations. If this were not the case, sound sensations would not be qualified to 
form esthetic relations. The firmly established and finely articulated contrasts of 
tone qualities specially adapt sensations of sound for such relations. 
If several sensations of sound are produced simultaneously by dissimilar sound 
waves or in such quick succession that we are still conscious of the preceding sensa- 
tion when the next one is perceived, there arises a complex idea of sound, which is 
presented to consciousness as a concrete relation as soon as the mind has been suffi- 
ciently exercised in making distinctions to be able to recognize single tones as 
members of a relation. Every concrete relation is an object of perception, a unit of 
its kind, strikingly individual, and can only be represented by symbols in fixation 
of its members. In the apprehension of the elements of our musical system and all 
concrete sound relations, the mind can be supported by written characters only, i.e., 
by musical script. 
The presentation of absolute tones and concrete relations of tones and exercise in 
their apprehension sharpen the hearing and acquaint the pupil with the diversity of 
musical material. An insight into the inner connection of this material and musical 
ideas, laws, and rules can only be gained by comparing absolute tones and concrete 
relations, and by abstracting what is common to include it in higher unities. To 
these higher unities belong the ideas of scales and keys, and particularly the ideas of 
intervals, as seconds, thirds, fourths, fifths,.etc. As the ideas of scales and keys are 
formed by comparing single phrases with regard to their material and accompanying 
concrete tone relations, we gain the ideas of different intervals as they oceur in any 
scale, and by comparing the intervals of different scales we retain what is common 
to them, namely, the uniform distance of tones (intervals) among all scales. Like 
any other material of thought, these higher unities can be retained by fixation in 
language only. They are named, and thus a common understanding is established 
concerning them. We then get names for both the tones and their symbols. 
Absolute tones and concrete relations are best represented by notes, because they 
are used exclusively in practical music; but intervals and abstract relations by fig- 
ures, because figures are familiar to the pupil and express the rise and fall peculiar 
to tone relations. The fact that it is difficult to comprehend absolute tones, because 
of their limited individuality, so as to reproduce them exactly, is no sufficient reason 
to omit symbols of tones from instruction in singing, and to use only the symbols of 
intervals. 
The ability to comprehend a combination of tones does not imply the ability to 
reproduce it. It is easily possible to understand a series of tones perfectly without 
being able to reproduce them. We are able to recognize them again, however, and 
     
-P-A-G-E-284

208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
can tell with certainty whether they have been heard in the same or another key. 
How else could we speak of character in reference to keys, or be differently affected 
" by hearing an adagio played in A (natural) which is familiar to us in A flat? 
The ability to reproduce presupposes more than the correct understanding of what 
has been heard. It is, moreover, dependent upon the anatomical and physiological 
construction of the voice, which is not at all essential for musical comprehension. 
The gift of understanding combinations of tone is much more frequent, and is gen- 
erally found in a higher degree than the ability of musical reproduction. It isin 
the nature of instruction in singing to require both accomplishments of the pupil. 
There will be greater and more pleasing success if the ear be supported by the eye, 
sensations of sound by their symbols, and if the ear be continuously exercised in 
perceiving not only what is general, but what is distinctive in tone relations, i. e., 
the height and depth of their members. 
Any writing of symbols of intervals represents what is distinctive in concrete 
relations of the same kind, and therefore does not exercise the car in the apprehen- 
sion and distinction of different keys. Ideas of intervals can only be gained by 
hearing absolute tones. They fix only what is general to concrete combinations, 
namely, abstract ideas of sound. The characters receive sense and meaning by the 
ear’s perceiving a succession of absolute tones; that is to say, of any one of the dia- 
tonic scales to the parts of which the letters or figures refer. A system of instruc- 
tion which fixes in writing musical ideas, wholly notional, acquaints the pupil with 
the unity of the musical system before he has learned its concrete elements. ‘‘The 
psychological medium that should lead to the heights of perception is overleaped,” 
and this results at last in a weakening if not in a complete stunting of musical sen- 
sibility. For this reason no symbols of intervals can replace notes, though they may 
contribute to the advancement and thoroughness of musical education if they follow 
the learning of the customary notation, or supplement it. 
The matter of which instruction in singing treats belongs to mediate and partly 
to immediate knowledge. With the latter the inductive method should be followed; 
hence the elements of mediate knowledge must be derived from the immediate. If 
the combinations and relations of tones belonging to immediate knowledge include 
what is abstract thought (definition, law, or theory), then the development and fixa- 
tion in the memory of this abstract element must directly follow upon the presenta- 
tion and fixation of the knowledge gained concretely. The presentation and learn- 
ing of concrete relations and combinations, and the development and learning of 
musical ideas and laws, become in this way a series of school occupations which 
are in harmony with the inherently connected psychological processes of perception 
and conception, apperception, abstraction, and secure retention of what is general. 
From this it follows that the laws of intellectual growth require instruction in sing- 
ing to adhere to the formal steps of analysis and synthesis, association, system, and 
application. 
Analysis is divided into the analysis of text and musical analysis. Analysis of 
text must precede musical analysis, so that the pupil may imbibe the poetic spirit of 
the song at the very beginning of the lesson. If the text be familiar to the pupils, a 
short review will suffice. If not, the form and contents must be studied. In this 
case, analysis consists in the reproduction of those concepts and ideas which are 
related to the song text, so that when the new text is given out correlative thoughts 
are fresh in the mind of the pupil, and it need not be feared that its apperception is 
hampered by distractions and contradictions. 
Musical analysis aims at enabling the pupil to comprehend and reproduce the new 
melody; to reproduce the rhythmic and melodic elements already familiar, in so far 
as they are found to exist in the new melody, and may be freshened in the pupil’s 
mind. Musical analysis does not consist-in a reproduction of previously studied 
matter, but it refers in a special manner to that knowledge already acquired which 
is suggested by the new subject. As soon as the pupils are acquainted with scales 
and the chord of three, analytic exercises should commence. The tones of the
-P-A-G-E-285
  MUSIC IN GERMAN SCHOOLS 209 
diatonic scale and of the tonic triad (in the same key, of course, as the new song) must 
be so combined that the melodic turns and phrases which the song contains are 
heard in the analytic exercises. The chief tactic motive of the song to be learned 
must be the foundation for the rhythming of scales and triads. Musical analysis 
necessarily presupposes a certain development of musical thought. During the first 
year of the school course it is therefore impossible to any desirable extent. Under- 
standing of and feeling for what is novel are only conceivable when there is a resi- 
due of apperception material in the mind. But as most newly entered pupils have 
very few or no musical ideas new concepts must be developed from correct percep- 
tions and sensations, although aids to apperception can not be readily supplied, 
because relative as well as opposing concepts are wanting. 
So long as instruction in singing has not developed the most important elements of 
musical knowledge—the ideas of scales, keys, measure, time, ete.—musical analysis 
must be confined to reviewing previously practiced songs of similar tempo, which 
begin and end with the same tone and include similar series of tones. A recapitula- 
tion of all that the pupil knows of the laws of tones, of musical construction, enun- 
ciation, accentuation, and notation belongs to analysis, in so far as it is important 
in connection with what is to be learned, and only for so long as the pupil is not sure 
of applying his knowledge. 
Synthetic instruction is modified and ruled by the pupil’s advancement and the 
subject to be considered. If the text is new, form and contents must be studied and 
learned by heart. The melody must be then practiced, and the other stanzas of the 
text learned. It is of great importance that the new melody be presented pure, 
namely, without the mixture of alien elements. The teacher must render it correctly 
and as finished as possible, either by voice or on an instrument. Pupils are then 
involuntarily pleased, the new melody enters their minds, and is appreciated with 
proper sentiments. The more beautiful and perfect the song at first appears, tho 
more earnestly will the pupil strive to learn it. If the new melody is short and 
simple, so that the children are still conscious of the first tones while the last are 
perceived, then, for a deeper esthetic effect, the whole should be at once presented 
tothe ear. Practice, however, must always follow the law of successive clearness, 
line by line. The presentation and practice of new melodies must continue in the 
prescribed manner until the pupils are familiar with the written music. After that, 
new means of imparting-must be resorted to out of consideration for the pupil’s 
self-activity. The melody is then presented to the eye in writing, and the pupils, 
under their teacher’s direction, must convey the meaning of the notes, line by line, 
in corresponding tones and successions of tones or phrases. 
After having learned the melody, the pupil’s attention is directed to the time or 
rhythmie construction. While the teacher or different pupils sing the others observe 
whether an accented be followed by one or two unaccented tones, or whether the 
different tones of a phrase have the same value or not. After some thoroughness in 
this has been attained, the pupils may begin to reproduce the melody in writing, 
under the teacher's direction. 
Synthesis concludes with the writing of the melody and the study of the text. 
In the first, probably in the second, school year, during which periods the foundation 
of musical knowledge is laid, the study of melodics can not successfully be carried 
beyond synthesis. But from the moment in which the eye supports the ear, or nota- 
tion is made use of, the teacher may go beyond synthesis. Is it necessary, however? 
Tt has been said that involuntary pleasure can only develop into esthetic, rational 
pleasure after the pupil has an insight into the musical system, and that therefore 
instruction can not rest with the practice of a number of songs, but must acquaint 
the pupil with the elements of melody, rhythm and dynamics, etc. These elements 
are the foundation; they have the force of musical laws of general value and neces- 
sity in the world of sound. The concrete includes this pleasure; but it is clearly 
and distinctly defined by consciousness only when separated from the concrete, or 
what is accidental and individual. It receives a “general value” only after it has 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
    210 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
proved to be the same always in concrete combinations of tones, or after it is found 
to be a common attribute of relations of tone. 
The next step in instruction is to compare the concrete tones hitherto practiced, or 
the phrases of the songs learned (step of association). The combinations of tones 
submitted for comparison can be taken either from the last or earlier synthetic 
~ exercises or from airs learned at home. In any case, only such series of tones should 
be compared with which the pupils are familiar. Comparisons may follow in differ- 
ent directions and may extend to melodic succession, rhythmic form, strength, 
tempo quality, etc. The results of these comparisons are fixed in proper technical 
language. 
Whatever has proved to be common or general value in the step of association 
must be isolated and learned in the shortest and most concise form—be it an idea, as 
key or time, or a law, such as ‘‘every measure has the same value,” or “fa word must 
not be torn asunder by taking breath.” This work forms the next step, that of 
systematizing or generalizing. 
Although, in general, it must be maintained that musical ideas and rules, like all 
-that is abstract, can only be derived from the concrete, now and then, for the pur- 
pose of rounding off knowledge, a1 new idea may be presented, when ideas of 
similar origin are discussed, which may ‘‘absorb or apperceive” a new but relative 
idea. Thus, for instance, the idea of A major may be suggested if the pupils have 
in the course of their exercises met with those of C, G, F, D, and B majorand abstracted 
the general law. 
What the pupil has found common to all lessons he may note in a separate book. 
In this way he writes a kind of “singing school” for himself. 
As the different parts of synthesis can be treated with a regular insertion of correl- 
ative analytic material, so a definite part of the step of systematizing can be directly 
anticipated by concrete associate material; in other words, every lesson in singing 
and technical exercise can be followed by an abstraction of its salient points and 
general facts. 
Thus, if, by way of example, the newly learned song be compared with one pre- 
viously studied in regard to quality of tone, what is found to be common may at 
once be defined in a statement, as, ‘Both songs are in the key of G;” or “Both 
songs have # measure;” or “Both are to be sung allegro,” etc. Several songs 
being compared, this statement may follow: ‘All these songs begin and end with 
C, hence are written in the key of C.” The comparison is continued, and inter- 
rupted by a process of abstraction. Thus, by induction, and according to the laws 
of intellectual development, the pupils become possessed of many fundamental 
musical ideas, laws, and rules. This knowledge would be worth little if the ele- 
ments of music could only be applied to that concrete material from which they 
were derived. If, for instance, the key, kind of key, measure, and time could only 
be applied to those melodies which formed the stock of the pupil’s knowledge of 
songs, the musical education would be sadly deficient. The pupils must, therefore, 
be directed and practiced in observing and reading other combinations and melodies, 
and applying the rules and laws to new phrases and songs. Reading casy melodies 
and “second parts” must be aimed at. This work forms the last of the formal steps— 
that of application. If these exercises are extensively practiced during the last 
year of school, the pupil will be able to tell with tolerable certainty the signature 
of a new piece, whether it be major or minor, the kind of meter or tempo, etc., and 
he will, slowly perhaps, but correctly, read the series of tones, i. e., read the notes 
while singing; he will also observe the rules of breathing, voice culture, and enun- 
ciation in songs on which he has received no special instruction. The exercises in 
application also include the transposition of a melody from one ‘key to another; 
transcription of a phrase in the different symbols for notes and intervals; the sing- 
ing of different texts to the same melody; the reproduction of scales, ascending and 
descending, and using tones as the tonic; the singing of the tones of the triad and
-P-A-G-E-287

its inversion, etc. This is a comprehensive programme of work, but German teach- 
ers succeed in carrying it on in elementary schools. 
The matter gone over in the music lessons is, comparatively speaking, very insig- 
nificant. The children learn a far greater number of facts in arithmetic, geography, 
and grammar. The only difference is that the application of the facts learned is 
more difficult, owing to the frequent undeveloped musical ear; but as the sense of 
hearing is developed the difficulties disappear. 
THE VALUE OF FOLKSONGS (VOLKSLIEDER). 
From the foregoing exposé of the German method of teaching sing- 
ing in schools, and from other authoritative sources, it is seen that the 
Germans pay much attention to their national airs in school, both to 
sacred and secular songs. It is done upon the ‘principle that in 
elementary schools it is not the chief object to increase the store of 
knowledge of the children, but to train their minds to correct modes of 
thinking, to build up their characters and will power for correct action, 
to ennoble the emotions to perceive refining sentiments and guide the 
will, and to generally educate the young rather than instruct them, to 
use these terms as the Germans do in implying a differentiation which 
we in this country do not usually accept. In literature, and even in 
simple language lessons, we naturally use the best selections from the 
works of classic native writers; in geography we direct the child’s 
attention, first of all, to his home surrounding and the topographical 
conditions of his own country; in history it is the events and memorable 
deeds of his own forefathers and countrymen which he studies, and so 
on through the course of study. We always bear in mind that the 
civilization and culture of his own nation are the sources from which 
his own culture derives its strength. Precisely so the Germans proceed 
in the teaching of music in elementary schools. Of course, music may 
be severed from its national influence and taught purely as a science 
and an art, but if taught in that way it does not serve the purpose of a 
school study which purposes to aid in the child’s mental and moral 
development. Every study in elementary school must do that, The 
reasons for using the musical treasures of the nation are pedagogical 
and ethical and eminently sound. 
The national airs of every nation reflect, more than anything else, its 
peculiar traits of character, both in text and music. The Slavic songs, 
mostly written in minor keys, reflect the melancholy mood of these 
peoples; the wild, weird ditties of Hungary reflect the fierce character 
of the Magyars; the placid temper of the Scandinavians is seen in 
their sweet hymns; the Scotch Highlander’s sturdiness is noticeable in 
his songs; the gaiety of the southern Frenchman, the cheerfulness of 
the Tyrolean and the Swiss—all these peculiarities are plainly discern- 
ible in the native songs and lays of these peoples. 
The vast treasures of mind, soul, and heart of the German nation have 
from time inmemorial been reflected in its folksongs, or popular melo- 
dies and rhymes, most of which were composed no one knows by whom,  
-P-A-G-E-288
  *212 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
but which were sung by all. From the fourteenth century to the pres- 
ent day the treasures of German popular airs have been increasing. 
The German “Volkslied” runs through the entire scale of internal and 
external life of the nation; it courses through feeling and thinking of 
all layers of society, and it is always true to nature, always grown on 
home soil, alvays genuinely German. The popular airs of Germany, 
both text and melody, are the most fragrant blossoms of the civilization 
of that country. In these songs, the sources of which never clog, the 
sounds of joy and merriment are as genuine and sincere as those of 
sorrow and grief; the tones of mockery and defiance as true as those 
of wrath and complaint. The heart of the German people pulsates in 
these songs, and he who studies them will find revealed in them the 
German nation in all its strength and weakness, in its virtues and 
faults. A collection of German “ Volkslieder” may be considered the 
secret history of the people. He who knows history can see in these 
songs that long chain of remarkable historical deeds that have made 
Germany famous, from the ‘ Nibelungen Saga” down to the “Wacht 
am Rhein.” Everywhere along the line traces are found of events and 
deeds which alternately raised and degraded the nation. 
The period in which the sources of popular airs and popular poetry 
were most prolific was the second half of the fifteenth century and the 
_ beginning of the sixteenth century (the era of Reformation). The 
dried-up court poetry of chivalry in the castles of knights and princes 
was superseded by the people’s poetry; the middle ages were sung to 
their grave and a new era was welcomed. But like the ancient stories 
of classic Hellas and mythical Germany, so have the songs and airs 
changed by adapting themselves to many new moods, conditions, and 
sentiments. Most of the airs now in use were composed or remodeled 
during the second half of the eighteenth and the first half of the nine- 
teenth centuries. Of most of these we are able to state definitely both 
poet and composer. A list of these is here added.

List oF COMPOSERS OF GERMAN FOLKSONGS. 
Notre.—Many German “ Volkslieder” are adaptations, both in text and music, of 
songs in vogue during the Middle Ages and the time of the “ Minnesiinger,” hence 
some modern composers are credited with having composed the music and some poets 
of having written the words to songs that bear evidences of a much older age; but 
there is no way of arriving at definite conclusions concerning their origin, hence the 
names of poets and composers to whom the songs are credited nowadays are men- 
tioned in this list. There are numerous songs of which neither poet nor composer 
are known; they have been collected by noted musicians, such as the brothers Ludwig

CHAPTER VI. 
THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL IN NEW YORK, NEW 
JERSEY, AND PENNSYLVANIA DURING THE FIRST HALF 
CENTURY OF THE REPUBLIC. 
By Rey. A. D. Mayo, M. A., LL. D. 
NEW YORK. 
We have already gone over the educational history of New York from its earliest 
settlement by the Dutch on Manhattan Island to the establishment of the first State 
constitution and the beginning of the career of what in population, wealth, and 
power is still the ‘“‘“Empire State” of the Union. We have seen why it was a prac- 
tical impossibility that in a State settled by a cosmopolitan immigration, from the 
first distracted by sharp ecclesiastical differences, through long years before the Rey- 
olutionary epoch divided by antagonistic social and political tendencies, and during 
the seven years of conflict for national independence its only seaport in the posses- 
sion of the enemy, could not be expected to inaugurate at once any effective system 
of education for the masses resembling the common district school of New England. 
Indeed, at the close of the great Revolutionary struggle the present State of New 
York west of the Hudson River and north of Saratoga could hardly be said to exist. 
The region that then constituted the Commonwealth, the islands surrounding the 
harbor of New York, the two banks of the Hudson through its lower 150 miles, and 
the eastern meadows of the Mohawk were the seat of the old aristocratic organiza- 
tion of society, and this portien of the State remained until recently the least pro- 
gressive in all matters relating to the education of the whole people. 
It is not, therefore, a matter of surprise that the first constitution of the State of 
New York containel no mention of the subject of education. But New York, like 
Virginia, can look back to the earliest years of its life as an American State with 
gratitude for the labors of a noble band of its most eminent statesmen in the cause 
of popular education. Contemporaneous with Jefferson, Washington, Madison, 
Marshall, and Cabell, in the Old Dominion, was found the cntire body of the fore- 
most statesmen of New York, who through the twenty years of its early history as 
a Commonwealth returned again and again to the almost hopeless task of waking 
the people to the fundamental obligation of uniting on the one common interest of a 
State, destined ero long to the political and industrial leadership of the Republic. 
At the first meeting of the general assembly after the adoption of the constitu- 
tion Governor George Clinton struck the keynote of the future of New York in 
these memorable words: ‘‘ Neglect of the education of youth is ono of the evils con- 
sequent upon war. Perhaps there is scarcely anything more worthy your attention 
than the revival and encouragement of seminaries of learning, and nothing by which 
we can more satisfactorily express our gratitude to the Supreme Being for His past 
favors, since piety and virtue are generally the offspring of an enlightened under- 
standing.” The response to this appeal was the act establishing the body known as 
“the Regents of the University of the State of New York.”

220 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Yet this was doubtless all that could be accomplished at the time. Tho people of 
New York in 1788 by no means proposed to surrender their prejudices of nationality, 
sect, class, and the furious antagonisms of partisan politics even to the sacred cause 
of the education of their own children together for the imperious claims of the new 
American citizenship. The board,of regents was at first essentially a body formed 
to do all that was possible to improve and unify the loose system of private and 
denominational academies and colleges which had hitherto been the chief depend- 
ence of the people for education. It was doubtfulif much could be done in that 
direction. The original King’s College, at New York, after a troubled history of less 
than half a century, had collapsed in the earlier years of the war from the Toryism 
of its president, and from the first had been tied up as the representative of the Church 
of England. After its suspension, during the war, an attempt was made to reorgan- 
ize it as a university, and on the failure of this scheme it became the Columbia Col- 
lege of the first seventy-five years of the present century—a respectable institution 
of learning, with limited patronage, but a reputation for large unavailable funds in 
unimproved lands on Manhattan Island. Besides this, there was no college in the 
State at the close of the war, and the academies and private schools were mostly in 
a demoralized condition from the strain of those terrible eight years. It did not yet 
appear that the legislature had in view, except in a vague and general way, the 
education of the whole people under the direction of the State. 
It was not till five years subsequent to this that the board of regents responded, in 
1793, in an indefinite and guarded way to the urgent representations of Governor 
Clinton concerning “‘the advantages which we conceive would accrue to the citi- 
zens in general from the establishment of schools in various parts of the State for 
the purpose of instructing children in the lower branches of education, such as read- 
ing their native language with propriety, and so much of writing and arithmetic as 
to enable them when they come forward into active life to transact with accuracy 
and dispatch the business necessary for the daily intercourse with each other.” The 
Governor had already suggested the setting apart some of the unappropriated lands 
of the State for the ‘‘promotion of literature.” This side light, thrown thus upon 
the condition of widespread illiteracy in certain portions of the Commonwealth, 
and the indifference: of the influential classes of the people to this condition, is 
suggestive. There are no statistics that reveal the extent of the popular ignor- 
ance, especially in the region first settled under the dominion of the patroons, on 
the shores of the two chief rivers; but the energy of the successive governors of the 
State in pushing the cause of general education is in itself a revelation of what was 
needed and the difficulties in the way of establishing an effective scheme for the 
remedy of the evil. 
A year later, 1795, Governor Clinton returned to the charge and pointed out the 
central difficulty of the situation in the following impressive words: ‘ While itis 
evident that the general establishment and endowment of academies are highly to 
be commended and axe attended with the most beneficial consequences, yet it can 
not be denied that they are principally confined to the children of the opulent, and 
that a great portion of the community is excluded from their immediate advantages. 
The establishment of common schools through the State is happily calculated to 
remedy this inconvenience and will therefore engage your early and decided con- 
sideration.” The legislature had already moved, in 1789, by requiring ‘the sur- 
veyor-general to set apart the lots in cach township of the public lands thereby 
to be surveyed for gospel and school purposes.” Under this original provision, 
reaffirmed in subsequent acts, many of the towns in New York have public-school 
lands of more or less extent at the present time. 
The legislature of 1795 responded to the public appeal of the governor by the first 
act for the education. of the people of New York. It provided that the sum of 
$50,000 should be appropriated for five years for the purpose of “encouraging and 
maintaining schools in the several cities and towns of this State for instruction of 
the branches necessary to complete a good English education.” The money was to
-P-A-G-E-297
EARLY COMMON SCHOOLS. 221 
be distributed according to the taxable population of the towns. The supervisors 
of the county were required to raise, by tax upon each town, a sum equal to one- 
half that appropriated by the State for similar purposes. A mischievous permissive 
clause, at first voted down, was afterwards reenacted, and emasculated the law of 
much of its vigor, since the communities most in need of education could be relied 
on to shirk the burden of local taxation which entitled them to their pertion of the 
State bounty, This bad amendment was afterwards repealed and the public school 
set upon its travels through the State. Each town was expected to choose a board 
of commissioners, from three to seven in number, to whom was committed the gen- 
eral supervision of the schools and the distribution of the moneys to the several 
districts. Each district of a town was authorized to elect two or more trustees, to 
whom should be intrusted the practical inauguration and management of the schools, 
under some oversight of the township commissioners. 
Here, at the outset, was introduced the habit of locating the responsibility for 
education with the individual districts, so productive of mischief and so difficult to 
abolish in New England. As each district was to receive its portion of the State 
fund under conditions, it can readily be seen how little aid could be expected at 
best and how slow must be the progress of a school of this sort. In 1798, 16 of the 
23 counties of the State reported 1,352 schools, in which 56,000 children were taught. 
The extreme sum available for all purposes under the law would be less than $2 per 
capita per pupil; all beyond was to be supplied by rate bills, if even these were, at 
that time, a substantial addition. In the record of sums appropriated for popular 
education no estimate seems to appear for this very unreliable element of support. 
In 1799 the first practical effort to establish a school fund for the State was made, 
under the legislative leadership of two men of Connecticut antecedents, Jedediah 
Peck, of Otsego, and Adam Comstock, of Saratoga. The recent action of Connecticut, 
in dedicating the avails of her great landed estate in the Western Reserve of Ohio 
to the children, appears to have been the suggestion of this movement. The act 
authorized the attempt to raise $100,000 by four lotteries; $12,500 was to be at the 
disposal of the board of regents for distribution among the academies of the State, 
with $87,500 for the common schools. Whether this plan, which was not then 
regarded an inappropriate method of raising money for any laudable purpose, was 
a success may be doubted from the record of subsequent attempts to hold the State 
to its payment of the original $50,000 annually. A new act was passed in 1801 
authorizing a new lottery of $100,000, the avails to be invested in real estate to be 
at the disposal of the legislature. 
Governor Clinton again appears in 1802, twelve years after his first appeal, with 
the declaration: ‘‘ The system of common schools having been discontinued, and the 
advantage to morals, religion, liberty, and good government arising from the general 
diffusion of knowledge being universally admitted, permit me to recommend this 
subject to your deliberate attention. The failure of one experiment for the attain- 
ment of an important object ought not to discourage other attempts.” The legisla- 
ture did not respond; and the good governor makes another demonstration in 1803, 
even more forcible in its appeal. The indefatigable Jedediah Peck, as chairman of 
the educational committee, reported a bill which died without attention. Again, 
in 1804, the governor prodded his legislature and Jedediah reported a new bill, with 
similar result. In 1804 a new governor, Lewis, seconded the efforts of his earnest 
predecessor in even more vigorous language: ‘Common schools, under the guidance 
of respectable teachers, should be established in every village, and the indigent 
should be educated at public expense. The higher seminaries also should receive 
every patronage and support within the means of enlightened legislation. Learn- 
ing would then flourish and vice be more effectually restrained than by means of 
penal statutes.” 
In a special message Governor Lewis, in 1805, urged on the legislature the plan of 
placing the entire educational affairs of the State under the absolute control of the 
board of regents, who should be authorized to use the State lands as an educational
-P-A-G-E-298

+ 
fund, appoint trustees for school districts, who should be empowered to raise money 
by taxation and generally administer educational affairs. But the people of no 
American State have, so far, looked with favor on the Continental European system 
of placing the entire control of popular education in the hands of the Government, 
and this system was not considered at the State house. 
But the earnest appeal of the governor had this result, the passago by the legis- 
lature of the act that laid the foundation of the school fund of the State of New 
York. The entire proceeds of 500,000 acres of vacant and unappropriated lands were 
to be invested and, when the interest should amount to $50,000, an annual distribu- 
tion was to be made to the school districts. In the same year the right to subscribe 
for 3,000 shares of a now bank in the city of New York was granted to the State and 
its avails added to the State school fund. In 1808 further provisions were made for 
the purchase of bank stock for the same purpose. But until 1810 no available system 
for the public schooling of the children of New York had been evolved from the 
efforts of the twenty previous years. Obstinato resistance continued as before, and 
the people were in no mood to be taxed for the cause of universal education. 
But the result of this twenty years of public discussion was not lost. In 1811 
Governor Tompkins again brought forward the whole subject of popular educa- 
tion, and was authorized by the legislature to appoint a board of five commissioners, 
to report on tho organization of a system of common schools. The chairman of this 
important committee was our old friend Jedediah Peck. A report was soon forth- 
coming which deserves an honorable place in the national literature of education. 
Incontrast with the past two centuries of the educational history of New York, it 
marked a great forward step. The committee heartily acknowledge the benefit 
derived from their careful examination of the common-school systems of the leading 
New England States, and the plan recommended by them was, in some respects, 
superior, first, in the provision for a larger responsibility assumed by the Common- 
wealth for education, and, second, the establishment of a State superintendency of 
schools. New York was the first State to strike this keynote of effective adminis- 
tration. For the next forty years, until 1851, the office of State superintendent of 
education, although for thirty years combined with that of secretary of state, was 
held by perhaps the ablest set of public men that ever stood in this relation to the 
pecple of any American Commonwealth. 
When we consider the almost insuperable obstacles that prevented the establish- 
ment of a good working system of common schools in the Empire State eighty years 
ago, we can easily understand what a prodigious advantage to the good cause was 
its almost unanimous support by the series of wise, far-seeing, and persistent New 
York statesmen who filled the position of governor, and, after 1812, held the office 
of secretary of state and commissioner of public education. The administrations 
of Governors George Clinton, Jay, Lewis, Tompkins, De Witt Clinton, and Marcy 
cover the fifty years from 1790 to 1840. No American Commonwealth has been 
favored by a series of abler and more patriotic statesmen than filled the office of 
chief magistrate of New York during this period of its history. And, beginning 
with the close of the first superintendency of Gideon Hawley, the State was even 
more blessed, until the year 1851, by the administration of a series of eminent 
public men in the double office of secretary of state and commissioner of education. 
John Van Ness Yates, Azariah C. Flagg, John A. Dix, and John C. Spencer occupied 
this position for thirty years, until 1840, at which time, under the leadership of 
Governor William H. Seward and Superintendent Samuel Young, a positive advance 
movement was inaugurated along the whole line. 
In their report to the legislature the five commissioners discussed at length a 
variety of topics connected with public education—its vital connection with the 
welfare of a republican State, the inability of any system of colleges and acade- 
mies to satisfy the great need of common schooling for the masses of the people, the 
intimate relation of moral to mental training in schools, the necessity of a great 
uplift of the qualifications of teachers, and the improvement of school books, the
-P-A-G-E-299

report closing with a fervent hope that ‘God would smile on the efforts of the 
people in a cause peculiarly His own.” 
The outlines of the plan submitted by the commissioners, and with some alterations 
afterwards adopted in the act of 1812 under which the State went on, with few changes 
of legislation, until 1838, were mainly these: (1) That every town should be divided 
into school districts by three commissioners elected by the citizens, who should have 
control of the distribution of all funds appropriated by the State or raised by local 
taxation according to the school population between the ages of 5 and 15, (2) That 
the voters of each district elect three trustees, to whom was to be intrusted the detailed 
management of a local school, under the general supervision of the three town commis- 
sioners. (3) That each town should raise by taxation as much money as it received 
from the State, the entire amount of State and town moneys being used for the support 
of teachers; and that a further power of taxation for building and furnishing school- 
houses and similar expenses should be vested in the district. (4) That the head of 
the whole system should be a State superintendent of education, chosen by the 
“council of appointments,” to whom should be intrusted a general supervision of 
common-school affairs. The board of regents, as before, retained its vague and semi- 
advisory power of supervising the colleges and academies, the chief practical result 
being the distribution of $10,000 annually from the literary fund among an increas- 
ing number of secondary schools. At this timo there were 45 counties and 449 towns 
in the State. The commissioners urged the point that the sum of $100,000, raised 
by local taxation and contributed by the Government, would not educate the people. 
But they pressed the absolute obligation of local effort to supplement the State and 
public aid, and relied on the rate bill, then in New York considered indispensable to 
any system of free schools, for the permanent support of education. The State fund 
then amounted to $115,000. The policy of the Commonwealth is outlined in this 
statement: “‘The object of the legislature is to arouse the public attention to the 
important subject of education, and, by adopting a system of common schools in 
the expense of which the State would largely arora to bring instruction 
within the reach of the humblest citizen.” 
It will be observed that in this scheme there is no provision for public education 
beyond the ordinary elementary schools. The extension of the common-school sys- 
tem of New York, through the secondary up in touch with the higher education, 
was not then in the mind of any but its most radical friends. In fact, the State 
waited during a full generation for the advent of the village and city system of 
“union schools,” which brought this opportunity to the children and youth residing 
therein. The original idea of public education in New York seems to have been a 
moderate subsidizing of the collegiate and academic institutions, without regard to 
their organization, requiring only the assurance that these schools maintain a cer- 
tain grade of instruction, with some other conditions. But the early suggestion of 
the board of regents that the bounty of the State might be extended to the masses 
of the people was at once taken up by the foremost statesmen of the period, and 
after twenty years a legislature was found that gave to the people of New York a 
working system of popular instructi But from that time on the State suffered 
in its educational interests by its division of responsibility in educational adminis- 
“tration. Until a recent date the subsidizing of the academies had little effect, save 
to postpone the time when the common-school system should include the high and 
normal school and the State university. The subsidy was too small to be of any 
practical benefit to the numerous academic schools that received it, while it kept 
alive their jealousy of the enlargement of the sphere of common-school instruction. 
But especially was the mischievous result of this policy apparent in the abortive 
plans by which the academies were subsidized with a view to obtaining from them 
the proper work of normal schools. While of course every good school in its way 
is a nursery of teachers, there was never a reasonable probability that the large 
number of academic and denominational schools receiving a pittance from the State 
would be able or willing to reconstruct their methods of instruction on a professional 
   
-P-A-G-E-300
  224 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
basis and become, in any way, efficient training schools of common-school teachers. 
Yet for forty years did the State remain under the delusion that any class of non- 
professional schools, especially any class of seminaries free from public control, could 
be relied on to do the most important work of professional training—the preparation 
of competent teachers for the common schools of the State. It was only after the 
failure of this experiment had been demonstrated beyond question to every compe- 
tent observer of public education that the first State normal school was established 
at Albany in 1851, and another long interval elapsed before the people finally swept 
away the persistent academical influence at the state house and put forward the pres- 
ent splendid organization of State and city normal schools and teachers’ institutes. 
Even as late as fourteen years ago this hostile interest made its last demonstration 
in the opposition of Governor Robinson to the entire scheme of support of normal 
schools by the State. But the decided response of the people seems to have finally 
put this contention out of court. The later policy of the board of regents in cooper- 
ating with the public-school system by elevating the standard of the secondary edu- 
cation has been, perhaps, the most effective service ever rendered to the people of 
New York by that respectable body. 
It was a great blessing tothe children that the first State superintendent of schools 
in New York, Gideon Hawley, was a New England man with New England ideas of 
popular education and a graduate of Union College under Dr. Nott. At the time 
of his appointment he was a young lawyer in Albany and a warm friend of the com- 
mon schools. His administration of eight years, from 1813 to 1821, was the genuine 
beginning of what is now the common-school system of the Empire State. He faced 
the difficulties and embarrassments of his trying position with a cheerful courage 
and persistent energy. At first, in 1814, he reported that the efficiency of the system 
was greatly hindered by the refusal of many towns to avail themselves of their permis- 
sion to tax, and, by his suggestion, the permissive clause, that enabled a town to 
shirk its obligation to educate by refusing to receive its portion of State money was, 
changed and the power given to the supervisors of counties to impose a local town 
tax corresponding to the sum donated by the State. Inhis second report, in 1815, he 
was obliged to announce that because the returns from the several counties were so 
few and so defective he must still postpone a statement of the statistics of educa- 
tion. But in 1816, three years from his appointment, he was able to say that 338 
towns in 33 of the 46 counties had sent in their reports. In 2,631 districts the num- 
ber of children between 5 and 15 years of age was 176,449, of whom 140,106 “have 
been under instruction during a portion of the year,” while, by estimate, there were 
5,000 districts in the State, with 250,000 children, of whom 200,000 were “‘ under instruc- 
tion.” The cities of New York and Albany were not included in this enumeration. 
Each school district received some $20 from the State, but the distribution of this 
small sum was regarded by the superintendent as a matter of great importance, 
especially in securing the organization of a general system which the State was 
pledged to keep alive, even by moderate subsidies. 
In the year 1821 the office of State superintendent of schools was abolished and 
the duties of that office combined with those of secretary of state. During the 
eight years of his occupancy Superintendent Hawley had rendered good proof of 
his stewardship. Under his faithful supervision the number of school districts and 
the school attendance had doubled; a three-months term of common schooling was 
secured by State and local taxation, often supplemented by the rate bill and the 
private contributions of the people, and twenty-four twenty-fifths of the children of 
the State had been brought under the influence of the system. The American com- 
mon school ‘‘had come to stay ” in the Empire State. 
The constitution of the State of New York, revised in 1822, contains the following 
provision for the permanent establishment of a State fund for the support of com- 
mon schools: 
“ARTICLE VII—Section 9.—The proceeds of all lands belonging to this State, except 
such parts thereof as may be reserved or appropriated to public use, or ceded to the
-P-A-G-E-301
EARLY COMMON SCHOOLS. 225 
United States, which shall hereafter be sold or disposed of, shall remain a perpetual 
fund, the interest of which shall be inviolably appropriated and applied to the sup- 
port of common schools.” 
The long and brilliant administration of De Witt Clinton as governor of New York 
dates from the year 1822. The governor, in his message to the legislature, called 
attention to the distribution of the United States public lands to the new States of 
the Union; that in eleven of these States and Territories there had already been dis- 
tributed one thirty-sixth of the public domain in their limits for common schools, 
and a fifth of that thirty-sixth part for colleges and academies. He urged the equal 
claim of the original thirteen States to a participation in the national bounty. 
According to his estimate, the share of New York in this distribution would be not 
less than 800,000 acres for common schools and 160,000 acres for colleges and acade- 
mies, a patrimony which “ would answer all the requirements of education.” 
In common with many of the leading educators and a majority of public men of 
that day, Governor Clinton was smitten with a great and persistent admiration of 
the Lancasterian system of instruction, and urged its merits upon the legislature. 
This method, which was a natural outcome of the crude provision then made in 
England for public instruction, gives the most important part of teaching, the 
elementary, to the older pupils. It had its long day of trial in the city of New York 
and elsewhere in this country, and is now cast away with other broken furniture and 
lumber in the educational attic. The ‘‘pupil-teacher” arrangement that followed it 
in Great Britain is now going the same way. 
The legislature haying conferred the duties of the State superintendency of 
schools upon the secretary of state, Thomas Van Ness Yates succeeded Gideon 
Hawley and administered the functions of the position from 1821 to 1826. He was 
succeeded from 1826 to 1833 by Azariah C, Flagg, who was followed by John A. Dix 
from 1833 to 1839. This period covers the administration of Governors De Witt 
Clinton, Throop, and Marcy, until the advent of William H. Seward, in 1840. It is 
doubtful if, by any different system of appointment, a body of men so eminent for 
statesmanlike ability and more earnest in the cause of the common school could 
have been placed at the head of its administration. Each of them endeavored to 
signalize his term of office by the introduction of some improvement, and none hesi- 
tated to keep before the people not only the substantial advantages of the new sys- 
tem, but the serious defects in its working, which, even more than they realized, 
impaired its efficiency and prevented it from securing the respect and confidence of 
the superior class in the education of their own children. 
It is not necessary to follow in detail the history of the very gradual progress of 
the common school in New York during the period of twenty years from the law of 
1820. The points gained were not unimportant, and the growing support of the sys- 
tem by the people was the best testimony that the State was working in the right 
direction. First and foremost should be mentioned the increasing attendance and 
support. From 6,332 districts with 305,000 children under instruction in 1820, there 
were 10,769 districts with 573,000 children instructed in 1840, From a State and local 
taxation of $200,000 in 1820, the expenditure in 1840 amounted to $1,386,000, of which 
$476,000 was in the form of rate bills or tuition fees, paid to secure a longer term of 
schooling. Superintendent Yates labored to inaugurate a system of school celebra- 
tions, to popularize the common schools and inspire interest in the children and 
parents, and puts the significant question, ‘‘Why should not our common schools be 
placed on a footing as respectable as any other seminaries of learning?” Governor 
Clinton opens up a most important discussion, in his message of 1826, on the subject 
of the curriculum of the common schools. Of the years spent in school he believes 
that two would be sufficient to acquire the elements of instruction, while the remain- 
ing eight are too often spent in “mere repetition, idleness, or neglect of the oppor- 
tunity for further culture.” He lays out a programme of instruction that includes 
our present grammar and high school course of study. 
ED 96. 8   
 
-P-A-G-E-302
  226 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
But the painful fact stared the educational reformer in the face that the mass of 
teachers were incompetent for this advanced movement. He therefore urged the 
establishment of ‘‘a seminary for the education of teachers.” The governor also 
urged the increase of the State appropriation and the appointment of a board of 
supervisors between the State superintendent and the town commissioners. At this 
juncture Mr. John C. Spencer appeared as the chairman of the legislative committee 
on education, with a most suggestive report, the beginning of the long and fruitful 
service rendered by him, fifteen ycars later, as State superintendent of schools. He 
called attention to an abuse by which the academies were subsidized by the beardof 
regents according to their number of classical students, and urged that the students 
in English should be included in the rule for distribution of these funds. He 
recommended the selection of academies for the preparation of teachers, and the 
printing, at public expense, of large editions of elementary school books, to be sold 
at cost. 
Governor De Witt Clinton returned, year after year, to the task of stirring up the 
legislature to the importance of the schools, In 1827 an addition was made to the 
common school fund, and the regents were instructed to distribute alarger sum than 
before to the academies on the basis of the number of their students in the higher 
branches of an English education. In 1828 appeared the first suggestion for securing 
the schooling of children engaged in manufacturing establishments. In 1830 came 
the suggestion of the establishment of district school libraries, which later became 
an important factor in the common school policy of the State. Theschool fund had 
increased to $1,700,000, and now first appeared at the capitol the rising spirit of 
western New York in an important memorial to the legislature from the city of 
Rochester concerning the education of teachers, urging the establishment of three 
State normal schools and one proper grammar school in each town. 
The administration of John A. Dix as superintendent of schools was signalized by 
a growing determination of the people to provide better agencies for the training of 
teachers. A sum of $12,000 per annum was to be distributed among such academies 
as would undertake the work of normal instruction, Superintendent Dix had still 
abundant confidence in the ability and disposition of these seminaries to do the great 
work for the uplifting of the common school teacher’s profession, an experiment of 
cooperation never yet realized between the people’s schools and the denominational 
colleges and academies. Several academies were selected, and the sum of $400 given 
to each for this purpose. In 1835 the policy of the State of New York concerning 
the district school library was inaugurated by authorizing the districts to impose a 
tax of $10 a year. By the whole-hearted cooperation of Hon. James Wadsworth, of 
Geneseo, this act was so administered as to become a great blessing to the people of 
the State. In 1838 the large amount of $160,000 from the income of the United States 
deposit fand was added to the general appropriation for education, $55,000 of which 
was to be appropriated for the building up of the district school libraries. The 
Hon. Daniel D. Barnard, one of the ablest and most worthy of the public men of 
New York, in 1838 put forth an admirable report, in which the whole subject of 
popular education was discussed with remarkable boldness and breadth of view. 
All things were tending to a decided forward movement for the advancement of this 
great common interest. The history of this movement, beginning under the auspices. 
of Governor William H. Seward, with John C. Spencer as secretary of state and 
superintendent of public instruction, will be told in another place. 
It is evident that, with the undeniable progress of the State in public school mat- 
ters during the fifty years now under consideration, there were grievous defects both 
in the system itself and in its administration, which impaired its usefulness to a 
large extent. 
First was the inability of the school authorities to ascertain the actual attendance 
of the children. All the State superintendents reported the number of children 
“receiving instruction” during any period of the year, without regard to the vital 
distinction between the enrollment and the average daily attendance of pupils. In

this way the people remained under the mistaken impression that nearly the entire 
body of children in the State were actually at school; indeed, that there were some- 
times ‘under instruction ” a larger number than the entire school population between 
the ages of 5 and 15. In the majority of the States the gap between the enrollment 
and the number in average daily attendance is formidable. In the whole country 
only 9,000,000 of 14,000,000 are reported in ‘‘average daily attendance.” At that 
early day there was no system of school statistics of practical value in any State 
of the Union. There is no proof that New York was an exception to the habit of 
irregular attendance, which in itself is one of the most serious defects of a.public 
school system. It was not until later that the county supervision of schools was 
adopted. The town commissioners were in many cases grossly negligent of their 
duty, and the local trustees bore the real burdens of administering the public edu- 
cation of the State. 
This repeated exposure of the serious imperfection of the district schools by sue- 
cessive governors and State superintendents seems to leave little doubt that up to 
1840 there were, with few exceptions, only clementary district schools in the State, 
and that the academies and private schools of higher grade were regarded sufiicient 
for the demand of the secondary education. Of course this was a serious defect in 
tho system, estranging from its support the entire class of wealthy and more culti- 
vated families, and building up a great body of academical and private institutions. 
It was not until after 1840 that the scheme of ‘union schools” in villages and neigh- 
borhoods supplied this deficiency. E 
Under this lurked the real weakness of the public school system of New York up 
to this period of reform—the multitude of incompetent teachers, Governors and 
legislative committees do not go on year after year exposing imaginary defects in a 
great public institution they are naturally inclined to estimate at its best. The 
lamentable inefficiency of the common school teaching force as a body must have 
been understood by all competent observers as revealing a state of affairs that 
deprived the system of much ofits value. The fight made by the academic and sec- 
tarian institutions against the establishment of normal schools and the failure of the 
attempt to utilize them for the purpose of normal instruction were great hindrances 
to the proper working of the system. 
While in this respect New York suffered in common with the New England States 
and was decidedly in advance of them all in the organization of a system of State 
supervision, surpassing Massachusetts in her school fund and the increasing contri- 
bution of tho State, and Connecticut in the habit of local taxation, yet there was a 
characteristic difference between the two portions of the country in respect to this 
as to all matters of public interest. The tendency of public affairs in New York from 
the first has been toward the concentration of power and vigor of public administra- 
tion. In its larger aspects this feature of the public life of the State has manifested 
asplendid efficiency and breadth not to be denied, and has greatly increased its 
influence among the States and in school affairs. But in local affairs it was long 
since recognized as a growing evil by the reign of the municipal and neighborhood 
“boss,” who rules the public with a rod of iron, and turns government itself into a 
dismal farce. Tho result is that in a New England community of the older type the 
people, ‘jointly and severally” wero a far more efficient power than elsewhere. To 
this fact must be attributed largely the vigor and intelligence of the government of 
the New England towns, the care of the schools, and the general prosperity and 
competency of tho people. Without State supervision, with only the reliance of the 
people on local yearly taxation, there can be no doubt that, with all its serious defects, 
public education in Massachusetts was practically in a more advanced condition dur- 
ing this period than in New York. To this fact must be attributed the earlier moye- 
ment for educational reform of tle system of popular instruction in New England, 
the reliance of New York on New England men in every period of educational advance- 
ment, and the decided leadership from 1840 to 1860 of the New England States in all
-P-A-G-E-304

matters of public school administration. But, in turn, New England and the West 
haye derived from New York most important lessons in the matter of school supervision 
and the organization of educational forees. At a later period the normal schools of 
that State struck out on the ‘‘new departure” of the natural methods of instruction, 
in which has been developed the most characteristic growth of the American common 
school since the close of the great civil war. 
But whatever may have been the reasons for disappointment in respect to the effi- 
ciency of the common school system, it seems already to have arrested the develop- 
ment of the private and academic seminaries in the State and to have inclined the 
thoughtful educational public to insist more strongly every year on the enlargement 
of the district into the graded school and the transfer of the important business of 
training teachers from the subsidized academies to an institution wholly under the 
control of the common school authorities of the Commonwealth. The report of the 
board of regents, Simeon De Witt, chancellor, and Gideon Hawley, secretary, for 1834, 
shows that there were 5 literary and 2 medical colleges in the State, the former having 
under instruction but 760 and the latter 375 students. The 5 colleges report only 100 
graduates for the year. Columbia, Union, Hamilton, Genesee, and the University 
of the City of New York, with the two divisions of the College of Physicians and 
Surgeons, complete the roll of institutions devoted to the higher education, 
Of these, Union College, Schenectady, then under the powerful and popular presi- 
dency of Dr. Eliphalet Nott, led all others as a representative of reformed methods 
of discipline and a peculiar faculty in character training. Columbia, New York, with 
a large reserve of unsalable property, had but 100 students in the literary depart- 
ment, although its legal and medical branches were of larger extent, and its academ- 
ical annex reports 217 pupils. Hamilton, in Oncida County, reports itself in an 
impecunious condition, with 103 students, and Genesee reports but 58 students and 
a meager income of $3,568, chiefly divided among its president, 4 professors, and 2 
lecturers. The University of the City of New York, with 10 professors and 274 stu- 
dents, leads in numbers. No college in the State appears to have had an available 
fund. Probably as many New York students were educated at Yale, Williams, and 
Princeton at this time as at home, and Union College had a large contingent of stu- 
dents from beyond the limits of the State. 
The board alsoreports that79 “academies and other seminaries of education” arenow 
under their supervision, several female academies having recently been admitted to 
this privilege. Of these, 49 owe their organization to the action of the board and 
28 were incorporated by the State legislature. The sum of $10,000 from the income 
of the literary fund has been distributed among them in gifts ranging from $25 to 
$400. These institutions altogether contained 5,506 students, 3,390 of whom were 
engaged in classical studies. Since 1827 the number of these institutions had more 
than doubled (there were then 33 schools and 2,440 pupils), the large increase being 
due partly to the addition to the literary fund placed at the disposal of the board in 
that year. The value of all these academic foundations was $381,000, with $24,170 
invested in philosophical apparatus and libraries. The permanent funds of the 
entire group amounted to less than $200,000 ($194,222). Their united income for 
the year was $70,000 from tuition fees, $10,000 from other sources, and $10,000 from the 
literary fund, $90,000 in all. Two hundred and ninety-five towns were represented 
in the 5,000 pupils of these seminaries. Of these the Albany academies for boys and 
girls report an attendance of 250 and 280, and the Rochester high school reports 325 
pupils. Only 3 of the 79 had an attendance of 200, 17 of 100, and the board reports 
that ‘10 had ceased to exist.” 
When we reflect on the meager income of these institutions; on the small amount 
of their property and invested funds, in all amounting to little more than $500,000; 
that only $25,000 was invested in libraries and apparatus; that the annual receipts 
of the 79 amounted to less than $100,000, and that probably many of them were 
dependent on the pittance doled out from the literary fund; and also this other fact 
that the board of regents seems to have had little power to enforce any marked
-P-A-G-E-305
EARLY COMMON SCHOOLS. 229 
improvement in their methods of organization and instruction, the outlook certainly 
was not brilliant for the secondary and higher education. 
The board of regents at last seems to have become satisfied that the experiment of 
relying on these seminaries of education to educate the teachers of common schools 
was a failure. They say, “A considerable number of common-school teachers have 
been educated in some of these schools,” and give ‘‘special commendation” to the 
St. Lawrence and Oxford academies. The board “had hoped that the opinion, so 
often expressed by them, in favor of establishing in many academies a department 
for the education of common-school teachers would have succeeded in attracting 
from both the trustees and teachers of academies much more attention than has been 
bestowed upon it,” and express the opinion that a larger distribution of funds would 
have secured better results. The reports of meteorological observations made by 
these institutions bear testimony to a greater interest in the changes of the weather 
in New York than in the improvement of the quality of the 10,000 common-school 
teachers of the Commonwealth. At asubsequent period these subsidies were largely 
increased, but with no more satisfactory result. It was plainly unreasonable and 
unjust to expect that such a class of academies and ‘‘other seminaries of education” 
as appear in this report, generally ‘‘living from hand to mouth,” chiefly occupied in 
the proper grammar school and elementary educational work of a limited neighbor- 
hood, with teachers laboring on starvation wages, could be induced to concern them- 
selyes in such an experiment, even by a subsidy of $400 a year, insufficient to pay the 
salary of one competent teacher of pedagogics, for they were all the time feeling a 
natural jealousy of the common schools, which were already reaching upward to 
undertake the management of the secondary education. The only circumstances 
under which a subsidized group of academies could be relied on to do satisfactory 
work in this direction, as in the State of Pennsylvania, is where a small number of 
strongly supported and endowed seminaries are selected largely under the controlof 
the State authorities. Buta comparison between the normal-school work at present 
done by the neighboring States of New York and Pennsylvania, working under oppo- 
site systems, is suggestive of the inevitable result of attempting to subsidize private 
and denominational institutions in our American order of affairs to work for a great 
common interest of education, which, in proportion to its importance, must inevi- 
tably become a rival to their own prosperity. 
Of course there were in New York at this time other schools, private, corporate, 
professional, and denominational, not included in this report of the regents of 
the university. But it is certain that this group of 79 seminaries and 5 colleges 
fairly represents the condition of the secondary and higher education previous to 
the great national revival of education from 1835 to 1860. The city of New York 
was still working under the leadership of the Public School Society, of which 
we have already given an account. Born in 1805 as a relief from the state of educa- 
tional destitution in which the old-time system of parochial church schools had left 
even the New York of that early day, enlisting the best efforts of the most eminent 
men in the State—De Witt Clinton, Theodore Sedgwick, G. C. Verplanck, and others 
only less eminent—subsidized for many years by the city and State, it failed at last 
to accomplish the ends of a public-school system by the prolonged ecclesiastical 
contest into which it was forced. Although not really a sectarian body, buta Protes- — 
tant organization with Presbyterian affinities, and in its policy, as far as was pos- 
sible, acting with the best intentions for the common good, it was finally wrecked 
on the rock of ecclesiastical jealousy. 
In the prolonged controversy in which it was involved during the latter years of 
its existence, which turned upon the general subject of religious and moral instruc- 
tion in common schools, the ablest ever held in this country, excepting possibly 
the similar discussion in Cincinnati, Ohio, thirty years later, the representatives of the 
Public School Society, though triumphant in the general argument, were driven to the 
wall by their own logic. Under the educational policy that the State had pursued 
from the first, which by its board of regents assumed a modified supervision over the
-P-A-G-E-306
230 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
colleges and academies of the State, with a yearly subsidy to all secondary and 
collegiate schools that would conform to its conditions of acceptance, the Catholic 
parochial schools of New York had a strong argument for public support. By this 
policy the State admitted to the full extent the present policy of England, whereby 
all classes of schools, private, corporate, and denominational, may be included in 
the distribution of public funds on the condition of submitting to literary examina- 
tions and accepting certain limitations offered by the representatives of the Govern- 
ment. The increasing moral and educational destitution of the children of the 
poorer classes of the Commonwealth at a later period so wrought on the mind and 
heart of Governor William H. Seward that he was forced into the position of recom- 
mending the support of church parochial schools by the State. But the people of 
New York saw further than their great philosophical statesmen, and in 1851 the Pub- 
lic School Society dissolved itself, and all its educational functions and properties 
were turned over to the common school authorities of the metropolis. 
The city of Albany was also from the first the headquarters of the conservative 
idea of education. Its academies for boys and girls were always superior institu- 
tions and, with the neighboring schools of the city of Troy, furnished a sufficient 
opportunity for the secondary, as did the colleges of Union and Williams for the 
higher, education. But in 1840 Mr. Francis Dwight, the accomplished educational 
journalist, at that time superintendent of schools for Albany County, makes the fol- 
lowing significant report: In Albany [city] there were 3 academies, with 503 pupils, 
conducted at an expense of $12,500; 83 private schools, with 2,866 pupils, costing 
$25,463, and 10 district schools, with 2,562 pupils, costing $9,081. Thus the 3,300 
children were educated in the private schools at a cost to the people of the city of 
$37,900, more than fourfold the sum ($9,000) expended on the 2,500 children in the 10 
district schools. Mr. Dwight affirms that in nine-tenths, probably in all but one or 
two of these private schools, the teaching was inferior to that of the public schools. 
Fifteen hundred children in the city, which then had a population less than 50,000, 
“were growing up in idleness, many of them in vagrancy and crime, all candidates 
for the almshouse or the jail.” The mayor of the city informed him that not a dis- 
turbance in the city has occurred for ten years that has not been traced to boys under 
16. Even twenty years later, 1862, the public schools of Albany were probably 
inferior to almost every city of 75,000 people in the Northern States, with no free 
high school and but one schoolhouse which the people cared to show. The colored 
children of the cities of New York State were, at this period, schooled by themselves, 
1,200 being then provided for in the city of New York alone, although in the country 
districts they often attended school with the white children, 
The great result of the thirty years’ work at the public school problem, from 1810 
to 1840, appears in the State reports of the latter date, from which we learn that 
there were 10,769 school districts in the State, with 573,000 children ‘‘ under instruc- 
tion,” and $1,415,129 expended on the system, $275,000 donated by the State, $663,686 
raised by local taxation, and $478,129 paid by the people in the form of rate bills. 
This implies an expenditure somewhat in excess of $2 for each child under instruc- 
tion. But as the number of pupils in ‘average daily attendance” was by no means 
equal to this aggregate, the sum expended on those continuously instructed was 
somewhat larger. : 
Insufficient as may have been this appropriation according to the later estimates, 
even less than that of any of the States of the South that have adopted the common 
school system only within the past twenty years, it was a most hopeful showing 
compared with the record of 1815, when only $105,000 was raised by public taxa- 
tion for 140,000 children in 2,600 school districts. In the establishment of State and 
for a time city supervision, in the founding of school libraries, the increase of the 
State school fund, and the growing demand for the professional training of teachers, 
the State was not behind, in some respects was in advance of the New England States 
at the same date. But in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut tho great 
revival of common schools was already under full headway, and the time was near
-P-A-G-E-307
EARLY COMMON SCHOOLS. 231 
when the Empire State would look toward the sunrise and join hands with New 
England, and, toward the sunset, join with the new Northwest, not failing to act 
even with more direct influence upon the neighboring States, New Jersey and Penn- 
sylvania, on the southern border. 
DR, ELIPHALET NOTT. 
We have already called attention to the peculiar genius for executive capacity in 
public affairs displayed from the earliest time in the State of New York. In no 
instance was this fact more clearly illustrated, and the dependence of the people of 
that State on a commanding leadership in a good cause more triumphantly demon- 
strated than in the building of Union College at Schenectady under the remarkable 
presidency of Dr. Eliphalet Nott. It may well be questioned whether during the 
critical period in American education, from the establishment of the National Gov- 
erment to 1840, any single man contributed so largely to set in motion the most vital 
currents of popular education in all its varied relations to the new Republic in one — 
State as this great man. Born in 1773 and dying in 1866, his long life of 93 years 
spanned the generations from the opening guns of the Revolution at Lexington, 
Mass., to. the surrender of the Confederate army at Appomattox Court-House, Va. 
At the close of the first half century of the Republic, 1840, he said: 
«When I entered on life there was no provision for common schools, and next to 
none for academies and colleges. To produce a change in public opinion in favor 
of these interests, to lay their foundations, required activities of a certain kind, and 
it has been my steady purpose not to live for the present, but to apply whatever 
influence I had so as to secure as far as possible remote and permanent results. 
What the end of my labors will be I leave with God, but I believe the whole process 
now going forward for cheapening education and providing tuition and books for 
the indigent will be found on inquiry to have emanated from Union College.” 
This declaration, of course, applied to the State of New York, for Dr. Nott himself 
was educated in and taught the common schools and academies of Connecticut, and 
graduated, as an outside student, from Brown University, Rhode Island, before the 
age of manhood. But the more we understand all the peculiar conditions of society 
in the Empire State, and the difficulties which, up to the comparatively late period 
of 1812, prevented the establishment of anything like a fair beginning of universal 
education, the more evident does it become that here was the right man, sent at first 
into the wilderness beyond the Hudson River as a minister of the gospel, who, in 
obedience to the unmistakable call of Providence, in ten years found himself at the 
central point of educational influence, on the verge of the new and in striking dis- 
tance of the old New York, in the most favorable position to deal with the legisla- 
ture and call to himself the powerful aid of the remarkable succession of public men 
who for half a century adorned the annals of the Commonwealth. No better illus 
tration of the peculiar way by which great things are done in our American order 
of affairs and the experiences by which decisive men are educated for conspicuous 
leadership can be found than may be seen in the career of this great college presi- 
dent and most influential leader in the developing life of the higher education in our 
country. It is a significant fact that, as in the other case of Washington, the ablest 
men that knew Dr. Nott best always gave the highest estimate of his general ability 
as an educational statesman, and had the most implicit faith in his character as a 
man. 
Eliphalet Nott was born in the town of Ashford, Conn., in 1773, of very poor but 
superior parents. His father was one of the well-known class of men who are all 
their lives held on the verge of poverty by some defect in business capacity, the only 
serious defect in his pronounced manliness. His mother was fitly declared by her 
distinguished son ‘‘a great and good woman.” The family had drifted “ from pillar 
to post” for several years before little Eliphalet saw the light and was taken to his 
mother’s perfect confidence by that divine instinct whereby the mother of Jesus 
     
-P-A-G-E-308
  232 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
“kept all these things in her heart.” To her he owed his first instruction, for at 
3 years of age he could read, and at 4 he had read the Bible through. The Bible, 
a spelling book, a primer, and a volume of old sermons constituted the family library. 
Eliphalet tells his own story of occasional attendance at the district school of his 
neighborhood at different ages, ‘‘always happy if he was not thrashed more than 
three timesa week.” The unfortunate master may not have been all ‘‘to blame,” for 
the boy had a brooding hurricane shut up in his feeble frame. It is told that, coming 
home from the Baptist Church where a powerful sermon had been preached against 
a prevailing style of female headdress, he proceeded to tear into shreds his sister’s 
ornament of this description, whereupon his “‘ great and good mother” displayed at 
once her greatness and goodness by giving the young family apostle of dress reform 
a sound “basting.” Between his mother’s love and the severity of his school 
thrashings, he early came to the full resolve that “if he lived to be a man, he would 
never try to rule children at home or in school by this old-fashioned way.” He was 
sent to live with his elder brother, Samuel, a young minister at Franklin, Conn., as 
a relicf to his overburdened father, but revolted from the iron rule of that household 
and came home to abide with his beloved mother until her death, when he was 16. 
“The light of my young life went out when my mother died,” said her great son, 
years afterwards, declaring like so many others of the world’s most famous men that 
the best of what he was he owed to his mother. 
He had already attempted to be a doctor, at the age of 14 beginning the study of 
medicine with the town physician. But the first surgical operation at which he 
was called in as the assistant of the old doctor found the poor woman on the 
operator’s table serene and brave and ‘Dr. Eliphalet” sprawling in a fainting fit on 
the floor. That experience ended his career in medicine. .It is interesting to see 
how, with a nervous organization so delicate and a bodily habit for many years | 
singularly feeble, was joined the will with which he not only accomplished the 
mighty work given him to do, but by lifelong temperance and watchful care, built 
up a state of reliable health that held out through eighty years of continuous labor. 
For sixteen years in his early manhood he studied fourteen hours a day and slept 
but four hours at night, and in an age of indulgence in coarse luxury and drunken- 
ness became a conspicuous object lesson of the wisdom of temperance and self-control. 
His introduction to educational work was in one of those old Yankee school dis- 
tricts where the bad boys had conquered a series of “masters” and held the town 
itself at bay. In a month, without striking a blow, by the influence of his charm- 
ing and powerful personality alone, he had reformed the habit of years and become 
a marked young man in “all the region ’round about.” Another experiment only 
more thoroughly established his reputation as a manager of children and youth, 
and, before he was 20 years old, he was found in Plainfield, Conn., at the head of the 
most important academy in that part of the State. He took his degree at Brown 
University, by advice of the faculty, without residence, studied theology with his 
brother Samuel, and was admitted to the Christian ministry at 22. He was greatly 
indebted to the friendship of Rey. Dr. Benedict, and at 23 heard the call to go forth 
into the wilderness of western New York as a missionary to Cherry Valley, near 
Otsego Lake. 
Even then his remarkable foresight was displayed by his determination to escape 
the impending war of theological controversy he saw brooding like a thundercloud 
over the ecclesiastical horizon. While in Connecticut he was brought ‘“ under dis- 
cipline” in a chureh trial for plain speaking in matters theological and personal, 
and his victory over his persecutors served as the lesson of a lifetime. Later, after 
he was invited to the presidency of Union College, he declined a pressing ‘‘ call” to 
Park Street Church, Boston, although we find him preaching in the “ broad church” 
pulpit of Dr, Buckminster, of the Brattle Street Church in that city. He then 
predicted the long and bitter period of theological controversy about to come upon 
New England, and felt instinctively that while preaching the gospel in the broad 
sense was the great privilege of any man it was not assigned to him to spend a

EARLY COMMON SCHOOLS. 233: 
lifetime wandering amid the boundless maze of theological and ecclesiastical conten- 
tion. He went cheerfully with his young wife to his new home at Cherry Valley, 
only sleeping one night on the way in Albany, then a Dutch town thoroughly and 
just made the capital of the State. The region about Albany was still but sparsely 
settled, and the journey of 75 miles to Cherry Valley, in the southwest, was largely 
by a rough highway through the primitive forest. 
This outpost of civilization had been settled in 1740 chiefly by Germans from the 
Palatinate, with a corps of Scotch Presbyterians at the little village of Cherry Valley. 
During the Revolutionary war the settlement was desolated by a raid of savages, 
and not till the return of peace was the permanent occupation of the place secured. 
A Rey. Mr. Dunlap, a graduate of Dublin University, Ireland, had established a 
church and set up the first school west of Albany. It was to this people, Presby- 
terian in church affiliations, that the young Connecticut minister went with his 
accomplished wife and at once began his public life work. In two years he had 
reestablished the church and built up an academy that for many years remained one 
of the most successful and useful of the secondary schools of the State. At once he 
became the real church and educational center of the region, as he always was to 
the day of his death the man of all good work in a new country. He never seems to 
have made any very serious objection to the old-time Calvinistic theology he brought 
with him from the land of stiff creeds and “steady habits,” and remained nominally 
a consistent Presbyterian divine to the end. But he was a great, good, broad- 
minded, deep-souled, magnetic, all-compelling man, beyond any limitations of sec- 
tarian creed and church. His policy was all comprehended in the law of the love of 
God and love of man, His wide charity and comprehensive fellowship included all 
good people of all churches and of no church. ‘Let alone parties, let alone contro- 
versy, let alone heresy,” he wrote to his son-in-law, the rector of an Episcopal church 
and the future bishop of Pennsylvania, Not that parties and controversies and the 
confutation of heresy were not well enough for those who had a ‘‘call” that way. 
But to the mind of Pastor Nott, called to the leadership of the education of the 
people of a leading American State in the most critical years of the new Republic, 
its first half century, the one thing needful seemed a dispensation of fundamental 
religion. And, for the time being, he believed that the most effective dispensation 
of practical fundamental religion would be through a policy by which the popula- 
tions of New York and Pennsylvania could be united to walk the common highway 
of a Christian civilization, universal education for American manhood and woman- 
hood, and good American citizenship. 
It is not often that even a man so born to distinction as Dr. Nott graduates from 
his elementary professional school so early. In two years he had outgrown Cherry 
Valley, the outpost of New York civilization toward the southwest, and, at the ear- 
nest persuasion of John Blair Smith, first president of Union College, in 1796, removed. 
to Albany, as pastor of the First Presbyterian Church. Here, at once, in the heart of 
the conservatism of the original settlers, alongside the largest domain of the Patroons, 
he became the recognized leader of the New England ideas and people. There were 
then only four churches in the little capital city of 8,000 people—Dutch Reformed, 
Presbyterian, Lutheran, and Churchof England. It was well that, appearing as the 
representative of New England ideas and institutions, he adopted the favorite middle- 
state ecclesiastical polity of Presbyterianism, under which the colonial reformers in 
the higher education had so far made headway. In1763 Albany had but 3,000 people 
and only five New England families. Until 1782 the preaching in the popular churches 
had been in the language of Holland, Dr. Westerloo having begun to preach 
in English only fifteen years before the arrival of the Presbyterian parson from 
Connecticut. 
Only a man like Eliphalet Nott, with his varied gifts as a nafural orator and most 
attractive presence, a statesman of consummate tact, and a born controller and leader 
of men, could have made his way to the head of the Albany pulpit in the face of the

eternal feud between the Dutch and Yankee, whose echoes still linger in the spacious 
halls of the new’ statehouse, in the present splendid capital of the Empire State, 
His congregation was composed not only of his own people, but included men like 
Hamilton, Clinton, the best portion of the legislature, and the throng of distin- 
guished strangers that haunted the lobbies of the capitol, crowded the hotels and 
boarding houses, and swarmed on the steep slopes of State street. Atonce his natural 
tendency to educational activity was called into play by a movement in behalf of the 
establishment of the Albany Boys’ Academy. This school, projected in 1804, was 
actually set up in 1813, at an expense of $100,000. According to the plan projected 
by Dr. Nott, this was to have been the proper high school of the city, with branches 
in all sections of the town for elementary instruction. To what extent this was to 
have been a sufficient public school system for the city, or an imitation of the Public 
School Society movement in the city of New York, projected at the same time, dees 
notappear. It failed in this form, although the academy which was finally cstab- 
lished, with the Albany Female Academy, a later foundation, became tho real head of 
the secondary education for the leading class of the town for half a century to come. 
The young preacher soon became noted for his “ occasional sermons” preached in 
behalf of the local charities and memorial discourses for distinguished people, and 
generally for a free and bold dealing with the moral and religious status of public 
affairs. He early set his face against the luxurious and drinking habits of the fore- 
most society of the town, refused to attend the dinner parties of his rich parish- 
ioners, broke down the old-time custom of closing a funeral ceremony in the upper 
circles by an adjournment to the house of the deceased, with a mighty feast and all 
that belonged thereto, a high-toned imitation of a ‘ wake,” and in more ways than 
one became a noted “man of all work;” above all catholic and conciliatory, but 
below the surface of his public ministry all the time working at the uplift of society 
by the lever of universal education. 
His large reputation as a preacher of ‘occasional sermons” culminated in a power- 
ful discourse on the melancholy death of Alexander Hamilton. When we read this 
sermon, than which few discourses preached in the American pulpit have exerted a 
wider and more wholesome influence, we may be somewhat at a loss to account for its 
great reputation, tested by the more exacting pulpit standards of to-day. Although 
rated among the foremost of American preachers during his entire life, Dr. Nott 
always used the sermon as he used all agencies of influence—to accomplish a definite 
purpose. He wrote his discourses carefully, with a special intent, and the present 
effect was greatly due to his impressive extempore delivery. His memory was a 
miracle. He could repeat with accuracy the entire proceedings of the day before of 
an important legislative committee, and only required the short interval between 
the morning and afternoon church service to commit to memory his later discourse 
so completely that he was never at aloss for a word, and could bring into play all 
the forces of an attractive personal presence, a wonderful voice, with the facial 
expression and gestures of a born actor. In this special discourse we admire the 
boldness with which he assails the barbarous custom of duclling, the magnificent 
courage of his attitude in the face of public opinion, his prophetic handling of the 
great themes of public life with nothing of the apologetic manner so often assumed. 
by the great lights of the pulpit before the leaders of public affairs. This address, 
the occasion, and the man, combined to make the young preacher, not yet 30 years 
of age, anational character. 
His ministry at Albany was now approaching its natural conclusion. Hereafter 
he was to be known of all men as the ablest and most progressive reformer of the 
higher education in the country; the proper head of the new educational movement 
in his adopted State, and, beyond this limit, the most prominent experimenter in 
radical methods of college instruction and discipline which, ridiculed and denounced 
at first, have now become the commonplace of university administration and train- 
ing through the land. 
Meanwhile his home life had come to an end by the death of his accomplished and

devoted wife, who died in Albany, leaving six children in his charge. He gaye up 
his home, placed his little ones in care of judicious friends, and in the silence of his 
great sorrow awaited the call of the Lord. He had lived at the capital city six 
years, on a salary of $1,000 and $1,200; from an unknown missionary in a wilderness 
had become tho best known of the younger clergymen of the State, already noted by 
the few whose appreciation is the final test of permanent distinction, as onc of the 
most remarkable men in the Commonwealth. He had served as a trustee of the new 
Union College at Schenectady, and, on the retirement of its third president in nine 
years—Smith, Edwards, and Maxcy—was unanimously elected to the presidency of 
that institution. 
To the ordinary observer of educational movements in New York the acceptance 
by Rey. Eliphalet Nott, at the age of 31, in 1804, of the presidency of Union College 
would appear either an act of youthful presumption or the venture of an ambitious 
young man ignorant of the conditions of success in an undertaking so perilous. It 
was now ten years since a little academy, ornamented with a college “‘sign,” had 
been set up in the frontier village of Schenectady, a town of 3,000 people, including 
300 negro slaves, the negro graveyard a separate inclosure off on a windy hill in the 
suburbs. The location of the school had been sharply contested with Albany. But 
it can now be understood that the placing of the new institution only 17 miles west- 
ward from the capital involved the future character of Union College. Governor 
George Clinton and General Schuyler, with others, saw clearly that what was 
needed in the new State was a seminary of the higher secondary and collegiate edu- 
cation, planted in the frontier western town whose population and situation would 
be favorablo to such an enterprise, and whose aim would be to educate the young 
men to whom the State must look for its progressive and executive leadership in a 
near future, rather than in a city already old, fixed in obstinate socia] prejudices, 
hitherto displaying little interest in popular education, and in close contact with 
all the demoralizing influences of public life. It is doubtful if Mr. Nott himself 4 
would have consented to assume the presidency of a new college established at the 
capital. But Schenectady, even in the parlance of many of the older people in 
Albany in 1860, was ‘out west,” and in 1804, in all essential respects, 20 miles west 
of Albany was a “new country.” 
The final location of the school at Schenectady was probably due to the vigorous 
work of some of its own citizens, including General Schuyler, with the Rey. Breck 
Romeyn, although aided by influential public men. It was expected that it would 
represent the denominational interest of the Presbyterian Church as differentiated , 
~ from the Dutch Reformed and Church of England bodies that divided the population Pe 
of that portion of the State. At first the venture was an academy of little more 
than local importance. But a building erected at the cost of $60,000, afterwards 
turned over to the use of the public schools, was an announcement that the child 
was born to live. J 
A-succession of presidents, all men of mark, Rev. John Blair Smith, of Pennsylvania, 
a distinguished Presbyterian clergyman called from his Philadelphia pastorate; Jona- 
than Edwards, son of the great New England philosopher and theologian, and Rey. 
Mr. Maxcy, coming from the presidency of Brown University, Rhode Island, and after- 
wards president of South Carolina College at Columbia, were ail men above the 
average of college presidenis in the colonial or earliest national era. But neither of 
them seems to have apprehended why the new college had a call to exist. Their 
united administrations were included in nine years, during which a large majority 
of tho graduates were candidates for the Christian ministry. The school was in dire 
financial straits and literally ‘‘starved out” its presidents and professors. In 1804, 
when Mr. Nott assumed the presidency, there were but 40 students and 17 graduates. 
In 1820, sixteen years afterwards, the attendance had risen to 300, with 65 graduates, 
and Union College of New York was already becoming a name of national import. 
The explanation of this sudden rally in what was regarded a doomed experiment 
is now plain to every student of education in New York at the beginning of the

  236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
present century. It is found in the fact that a man was seated in the plain presi- 
dential chair who ‘took in tho situation” at a glance.- Two problems were pre- 
sented to his mind at the outset, one negative, the other decidedly positive. The 
negative problem was the fact that there were in New England and the Eastern 
Central States already colleges of the ordinary type more than sufficient for the 
needs of the people. Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Williams, and Brown in New 
England, Columbia in New York City, Princeton in New Jersey, and the University 
of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia—all respectable, well manned, and, according to the 
prevalent ideas, moving on proper scholastic lines. The University of Maryland, 
William and Mary and Randolph Macon in Virginia, the universities of North and 
South Carolina, and other seminaries aspiring to college work were amply suflicient 
for the Southern Atlantic Slope. With the single exception of the University of 
Pennsylvania, which, under the guiding minds of Dr. Franklin, Dr. Rush, and others, 
had been planted with a broad outlook toward a future system of public instruction— 
all these in the Eastern and Central States were essentially ecclesiastical foundations, 
devoted to the classics and the few studies that were but an annex to an exclu- 
sively classical culture, looking to the increase of the Christian ministry for their 
reputation and opportunity for usefulness. It was doubtless a great advantage dur- 
ing the long colonial period that these older institutions should thus concentrate on 
the training of a cultivated class (the clerical body), in order to resist the tendency 
to sheer materialism which was the ‘‘terrible temptation” of a new country in that 
day, and in order to lift the moral standard of private and public life in an age of 
rough license and growing prosperity. There is no evidence that Union College was 
founded originally with any essentially different idea than the establishment of a 
Presbyterian seminary of education and a headquarters of denominational propa- 
gandism in the new country. At any rate nothing happened in its administration 
until the advent of the young president from Connecticut, fresh from his laurels on 
the frontier and at the capital, to disturb this ideal, under which the school had 
been brought to the verge of practical failure and ultimate ruin. 
If Dr. Nott had been born thirty years later he might have become one of the 
foremost railroad builders or presidents that New England has sent forth during the 
past half century to draw the iron highways of civilization from the Atlantic to the 
Pacific, and from the northern boundary to the Gulf. He had the marvelous “busi- 
ness faculty” that was an instinct in the original New England character. With 
unerring sagacity he applied his mind at once to the financial situation. The entire 
annual income of the school in 1804 was $4,000, on which the president and teachers 
were working at starvation rates in the narrow limits of a frontier village schoolhouse. 
With the decisive energy and tact which characterized his entire career he utilized 
the large professional fame and personal confidence gained by his six years’ ministry 
in Albany for an attack on the legislature. Well knowing the impossibility of 
obtaining from that body any decent appropriation as “ State aid,” he availed him- 
self of a common expedient by which so many benevolent church and educational 
projects were founded a century ago, a lottery. Heasked from the State permission 
for the formation of two schemes of this sort, one for the immediate relief of the 
institution in 1805, another, of larger scope, including several institutions besides 
his own, the former for $80,000, the latter for $200,000. The lottery, like the college, 
would becomo a success or a failure according as the right man was at the helm. 
The result was that President Nott himself assumed the direction of the enterprise, 
and, by a masterly feat of financiering, not only obtained the face value of the origi- 
nal sums but laid up in store a fund of $600,000, turned over to Union College as a 
personal donation at the close of his sixty-two years’ presidency. 
Of course this experiment, so original a departure from the habit of the regulation 
college president of the day, drew upon the first great educational financier of the 
period the charges of selfish and corrupt administration that always beset the upward 
path of any able man on his appearance upon the perilous road to success. But 
Dr. Nott departed this life at the age of 93 with no stain upon his personal honor, 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
  EARLY COMMON SCHOOLS. 237 
absolutely cleared from all imputation of self-seeking, an eminent object lesson of what 
the successful president of a great American university is now expected to be. By 
obtaining this income he was able to lift the college buildings out of the everglade 
of petty village gossip and local intermeddling in which so many institutions of 
learning have been smothered in their infancy, and began to build upon a broad 
plateau overlooking the lovely meadows of the Mohawk, one of the most attractive 
sites of any American university. 
The next point in order was to switch the college train from the narrow clerical 
and denominational track out upon the broad “through route” of a collegiate school, 
which, not unmindful of the cause of good learning and in no way indifferent to the 
idea of a broad religious and moral preparation for all coming life and work, should 
give itself to that type of the higher education of which the new Republic was most 
in want, the graduation of a body of efficient young men, strong in self-reliant char- 
acter, broad intelligence, trained executive capacity, and popularsympathy, especially 
with the great problem before the life of New York and the new West—universal 
education for American civilization. All this was introduced with the firm hand 
and consummate tact that are an augury of success. 
The experience of Dr. Nott from fifteen years as a teacher in common and aca- 
demical schools had only confirmed his youthful idea of school discipline. Fora 
while he sat by and watched the regular habit of the faculty of Union Collego 
sitting in solemn state to try every offender against college law and order, censur- 
ing, imposing fines, expelling, and loading with penal humiliations the unfortunate 
boy whose animal spirits or crude manners were often a large element in his disobe- 
dience. As he expected, there soon came up a case of unusual difficulty, when he 
announced that hereafter that special high court ‘‘ was adjourned without day.” 
He inaugurated in its place the assumption of a personal responsibility by the 
president and professors, especially by the president, in dealing with every individ- 
ual case of discipline on its own merits. As in the case of President Timothy 
Dwight, of Yale, and Francis Wayland, of Brown, at a subsequent period, this sys- 
tem, in the hands of a wise manager of men and an expert in human nature, was a 
triumphant success. He removed, with his own family, and insisted on the removal 
of his entire faculty, to the boarding house of his students, where for years they 
lived together like one great household. Every boy was knowr personally, and 
after the first observation was never for a day out of range of the manly affection 
of the father of them all. He had the wisdom—so rare even among the best teach- 
ers—to fully understand that the secret of good school government is to bring the 
more influential students into cheerful cooperation with the faculty as an indispen- 
sable element in the making of the true community which every American school 
should be. He conquered organized opposition by dealing with individual students, 
thus destroying the mischievous habit of class and society combination. If a pupil 
was incorrigible he was quietly retired, with the hope of restoration on fit evidence — 
of repentance. He did not unload his own failures on other institutions or encour- 
age rejected students to come to Union, although accused of both these offenses by 
rivals, who gave to Union College the nickname ‘‘ Botany Bay.” But, as the origi- 
nal Botany Bay of the British Government has now become Australia, the wonder 
of modern civilization, so did Union College outlive this slander and in the end set 
the college clock of discipline half a cetttury ahead. President Wayland, of Brown 
University, carried the same idea to Rhode Island, and more to him and the example 
of Union than to any one influence does the American college and university of 
to-day owe its exemption from the old monastic rule of assuming that every boy 
entering college is a child of the devil and a college faculty a detective police and 
an infallible judge rolled into one to preserve the very existence of the institution 
itself. 
A distinguished public man, relating his experience as a student at Union College, 
said: ‘It was but a few weeks after I reached Union College, a stranger to every- 
body, from a New England State, that one day on the campus I saw Dr. Nott making 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
  238 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
haste to come up with me. He came up, out of breath, and threw his arm around 
me, saying: ‘My son, I want to saya word to you. We-have in your class a student 
of fine abilities who is getting into trouble by disobedience to college rules. Now, 
will you take hold with me and try to savo that boy? We need your influence with 
the class to do your best, that this boy shall be saved to be an ornament ard a pride 
tous all.’” Said my informant: ‘ That speech lifted me up from a boy to a man. 
From that day I first realized that I had the power to influence anybody but myself.” 
What was true of this man was true of every susceptible student of Union during 
the administration of Dr. Nott. Said the old president, many years later: ‘‘I love 
to learn of one who formerly sat at my feet asa pupil.” Under this administration, 
in the hands of a natural administrator of large affairs and a wise manager of men, 
if was not remarkable that Union College, in fifty years from the accession of Dr. 
Nott to the presidency, had received more than 4,000 and graduated more than 3,000 
students from every portion of the country. As we shall sec, many of the most influ- 
ential men in all the departments of active life, with a notable roll of eminent 
clergymen of all the Protestant churches, went forth from its halls. 
Of equal importance was it that the medieval spell of an almost exclusively clas- 
sical curriculum which, even until the Revolutionary epoch had held the American 
college,should be broken, Wisely avoiding a sharp controversy with the college 
faculty in this direction, he quietly solved the question by striking at the chief defect 
in tho reigning system—its ignoring of the English language and literature. He 
assumed the direction of the chair of belles-lettres and made himself as eminent by 
his method of instruction as President Mark Hopkins in philosophy at Williams. 
Under his leadership of a class the hour of recitation, so often dull and dispiriting, 
was lifted to a delightfal exercise by a free talk from the professor and discussions 
with thelearners, Every boy who was nota dullard ora ‘‘miserable offender” went 
forth from such an exercise filled with enthusiasm, with an ambition to be the kind 
of orator that Dr. Nott was, a man talking with and dealing with the head and heart 
of every individual hearer, and longing to bring mind and soul in contact with his 
finger ends insome act of decisive importance. He built up the scientific department 
of the college, not only by precept but by his own lifelong interest in scientific 
studies and his faculty as an inventor, having taken out thirty different patents and 
made his name a household word through all eastern America by the invention of the 
first stove for burning anthracite coal. 
Meanwhile the interests of classic and philosophic learning were not neglected in 
the persons of Prof. Tayler Lewis, Prof. Alonzo Potter, and Dr. Hickock, who all 
became men of national reputation in their respective departments. 
Dr. Nott appreciated the fact that many promising youth were unable to come to 
college or to remain during the complete course, and appropriated $50,000 of the 
earliest income to student aid, while he arranged his course of study for the con- 
venience of those who needed an extra time for graduation. 
At Union was laid the broad foundation of the elective system of study which, 
carried to Brown University by one of its early graduates and professors, Dr. Way- 
land, has finally reconstructed the entire university and college curriculum of the 
country. 
But it was perhaps as a great reconciler in religion and a master of conciliation 
between the rival sects and groups of discontented clergy, whose contentions dis- 
tracted the early American life, that Dr. Nott achieved his most signal success. 
Both within and without college walls known as a conservative Connecticut parson, 
he brought Union College into speedy accord with the foremost representatives of 
the Dutch, English, Scotch, and German populations in the valleys of the Hudson 
and Mohawk, made Schenectady the receipt of a steady patronage of students from 
the South, and reached over to New England for more than one boy, who went on 
“ont West” to become a man of mark. In the highest sense he was the instructor 
of New York politicians and statesmen in that aptitude for general administration 
which is the most evident note of superiority in public life of the Empire State. For
-P-A-G-E-315
  EARLY COMMON SCHOOLS. 239 
fifty years he was one of the most important public men in the Commonwealth, and 
all-powerful before the legislature; bearing himself in a judicial attitude before 
people of all classes, parties, and forms of faith. He refused a pressing invitation 
to go to Boston as arepresentative of the prevailing evangelical creed in the ministry 
at Park Street Church, one of the head centers of the controversy which rent New 
England, and from whose results these States have not yet recovered. But whilo 
retaining his high standing as onc of the foremost preachers and executive-forces 
of the Presbyterian Church, he absolutely refused to be dragged into any position 
of hostility or theological antagonism with any of the great religious bodies, includ- 
ing the Hebrews, Catholics, Unitarians and other denominations, in his broad Christ- 
ian fellowship. 
Thus, while Union College must have been regarded, in a sense, a denominational 
establishment, it was in reality one of the first in the Néw West to deserve the name 
of an American unsectarian Christian university. And after the experiments of 
a century in the art of eliminating religion from the life of an institution of 
higher learning in a republican State, it still remains true that the only reliable 
and permanently successful universities of the country are those resting on the solid 
basis of loyalty to a broad and practical Christian religion as the inspiring spirit of 
a high and generous culture, President Nott became, as the years went on, one of 
the most notable builders of the new American civilization. He said of the offend- 
ing student: ‘‘ Let the boy have a chance to try again.” He sent forth the leaders 
of the three great religious bodies from Union: Dr. Wayland, Baptist; Dr. Robert 
Breckinridge, of Kentucky, Presbyterian; Bishop Alonzo Potter, of Pennsylvania, 
Episcopalian, to say nothing of eminent preachers and ecclesiastics in the Dutch 
Reformed and other leading Protestant sects. He laid down his own law of execu- 
tive service: ‘We may take all the comfort God gives us, but we must defend the 
post at which he places us, though it should cost us wearisome days and sleepless 
nights.” His opinion of the controversies and bigotries that disgrace the sacred 
cause of Christianity is given in full: ‘If the Christianity of to-day should bring 
in a millennium, it would take two or three more millenniums to make this world fit 
to live in.” Princeton and Brown bestowed upon him the college honors of D. D. 
and LL. D. 
Tho roll of trustees of Union College from first to last leaves out few of the most 
eminent men of the State. No educational man in America has more widely gained 
the admiration and high estimation of its foremost statesmen than Dr. Nott. Many 
of the ablest of the public men of New York and other States—Spencer, Root, and, 
above all, William H. Seward, of New York, Bayard of Delaware, Rice of Massa- 
chusetts, were not only graduates of Union but largely molded by the influence of 
the great president. He became ono of the most powerful advocates of the temper- 
ance reformation, though always doubtful of the political policy of State prohibi- 
tion. He was on record, in opposition to his local interest, against slavery in the 
abstract and the policy of slavery extensicn. 
But in no direction was the influence of Dr. Nott felt—especially during the early 
years of his administration—more decisively than in the movement for universal 
education in his adopted State. Coming from Connecticut, where the common 
school had existed from the foundation of the colony, he saw clearly the difiiculties 
and dangers that beset any movement for the introduction of a common system of 
public instruction. It was significant that the first twenty years of his presidency 
fell in tho years of the earliest experiment at organizing the people’s school in New 
York—1812 to 1832. The first State superintendent of education in New York, Gid- 
eon Hawley, was a graduate of Union College, as was also the ablest of his suc- 
cessors, John ©, Spencer. From Union College went forth Dr. Wayland, who threw 
the powerful influence of Brown University on the side of the final movement in 
Rhode Island in favor of popular education. Bishop Alonzo Potter, one of the ablest 
advocates of state education in Pennsylvania, was a professor in Union and son-in- 
law to Dr. Nott. Dr. Robert Breckinridge, who saved the common school of Ken-
-P-A-G-E-316
  240 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96, 
tucky, was also one of the graduates of Union. President Tappan, the creator of 
the University of Michigan; President Hager, of the State Normal School at Salem, 
Mass.; William H. McGuffey, eminent as an educator and compiler of common- 
school books in Virginia and Ohio; Dr. Griffin, president of Williams College, Mas- 
sachusetts, and Jeremiah Day, president of Yale College, were also Union men. 
Of the 4,850 students of Union College up to 1854, 885 were clergymen, 1,070 law- 
yers, 265 physicians, 225 teachers and professors, and 95 farmers. Two Presidents of 
the United States, Martin Van Buren and Chester A. Arthur, and scores of men in the 
higher public and industrial life were the pupils of this great school. Roger B. 
Taney, William L. Marcy, Governor Rice of Massachusetts, John V. L. Pryne, John 
H. Reynolds, Erastus Root, William Cassidy, Preston King, Amos Dean, John Van 
Buren, N. P. Tallmadge, Peter Gansevoort, T. Romyen Beck of New York, and Albert 
Barnes and Theodore Clapp, both clergymen of great public influence in the Middlo 
and Southern States, were of the number. It is douhtful if any American college ever 
sent forth a larger number of influential men in public and professional life than 
Union during the sixty-two years’ presidency of Dr. Nott. In Governor William H, 
Seward and in John C. Spencer, secretary of state and superintendent of schools, 
he gave to New York the most important agents in the organization of the present 
common school system of the Commonwealth. 
EMMA WILLARD. 
While the great work of Dr. Nott was going on at Union College, Schenectady, 
another enterprise, fraught with equally decisive results in the State of New York 
and the nation, was inaugurated at the new city of Troy, 20 miles to the east, on the 
opposite side of the Hudson from Albany. ‘This was the establishment, in 1820, of the 
Troy Female Seminary, under the lead of Mrs. Emma Willard, with the cooperation 
of her husband, Dr. John Willard. Although but 5 milés from the capital, Troy was, 
in more than one respect, half a century away from its neighboring city of Albany. 
The latter was the center of the solid conservatism of the ancient Dutch régime; a 
rural capital city, where the active end of society revolved about the yearly meeting 
of the legislature and the residence of the State officials; a city that, until the 
advent of Dr. Nott’and his new Presbyterian Church, had failed even to provide 
sufficiently for the schooling of the children of its superior families, to say nothing 
of its neglect, until 1850, of any substantial arrangement for the education of the 
masses of its people. It would have been impossible for Union College or the school 
of Mrs, Willard to have become the characteristic institutions they were if located 
at Albany, even as late as 1820. Dr. Nott wisely planted himself on the frontier of 
civilization, at Schenectady, as a point ‘out West.” Mrs. Willard, after the usual 
discouraging experience with New York legislators of that period, left the little 
village of Waterford, where for two years she had supported a school, and accepted 
the offer of Troy to furnish a $5,000 schoolhouse with a public gift of $4,000 and 
private subscriptions, that in this new city, practically a New England colony 
on the Hudson, her great experiment might be tried for the higher education of 
American girls. 
As in the case of Dr. Nott and so many of the educational agitators and actors of 
this period of educational transition in New York, Emma Hart was a New England 
girl, straight out of the center of Yankeedom. She was born at Berlin, Conn., in 
1787, the year when Manassah Cutler, of Connecticut and Massachusetts, was 
manipulating the congress of the confederation in behalf of the magnificent gift 
of the national public lands to the New Northwest, which gave this empire beyond 
the Alleghanies the first great lift toward its proud elevation of public education, 
to-day its best claim to the admiration of the world. She was the sixteenth of her 
father’s seventeen children, the youngest being Almira, afterwards Mrs. Lincoln 
Phelps, who, in her day and place, was the true ‘other half” of this pair of great

Connecticut girls. She came of good stock. Her mother, a second wife and the 
parent of ten of the seventeen children, was one of those devoted, thoughtful, per- 
sistent women who seem born to refresh the generations by the gift of great daugh- 
ters and sons. While yet little children, Emma and an older sister were sent out 
every year, at the time of carding and sorting the wool of which the family clothing 
was made, to scatter the remnants for which there was no home use on the bushes 
that the birds might gather them up to build their nests—a beautiful prophecy of 
the big nest for the shelter and training of American girls built by Emma forty 
years later at Troy. Her father was one of that class of religionists who, even at 
that early day, revolted with all his heart and soul and strength from the terrible 
theology and ironclad bigotry of the old Puritan creed and social order. Being 
compelled, as an official act by his position in the church, to prosecute two men who 
refused to pay the regulation parish tax to support a church in which they did not 
believe, he did his duty—paid the tax himself, took the men out of jail, and ‘freed 
his conscience” by leaving the church, into which he could not be coaxed again until 
the day of his death. It was out of such a combination of deep religious mother faith 
and love for all God’s creatures and the father’s defiant courage in “ forcing the fight” 
of dissent that the character of this most womanly of women, most courageous and 
capable of educational reformers, was all compact. 
Her education until the age of 15 was obtained from her parents, with the aid of 
the ordinary district school of the day. After 15 she spent two years with Dr. 
Miner, where she studied hard to keep ahead of her examinations, even wrapping 
herself in a big overcoat and sitting on a horse block in her father’s woodshed to 
study her lessons while the home resounded with the racket and roof-splitting fun 
of a young people’s party within. At the age of 17 she was urged to open a school 
for young children in her native village. The forenoon of the first day was spent 
in the vain attempt to bring her crowd of incorrigible youngsters into any condi- 
tion of obedience or attention to the orders of the young schoolmistress. At the 
noon recess she supplied herself with a bundle of stout rods and spent the whole 
afternoon in administering asound thrashing to every member of the school. After- 
wards that particular school understood that ‘order is Heaven’s first law.” At the 
close of the term her reputation as a teacher was established at home and ‘through 
the region ’round about.” 
From this experience she turned again to her own schooling, and spent two years at 
Hartford, Conn., in two of the best schools of the town, with tuition at “two and six- 
pence and board at 12 shillings a week.” This was the end of her sghool life, although 
she remained a persistent student until the end of her life at the age of 83. She 
returned to teach the academy at Berlin, from which she was soon invited to attract- 
ive positions in three States. She lingered at the old academy at Westfield, Mass., 
a few months on her way to her final New England work at Middlebury, Vt. Here 
she established a school for girls which soon made itself felt in such fashion that the 
great dons of Middlebury College condescended to attend itsexaminations and com- 
mencements and warmly praised the young schoolmistress, with the qualification 
that ‘it would be altogether irregular for her and her girls to be seen on similar 
occasions at the college.” But already this bright young maiden had “taken the 
measure” of the college itself, and asked herself the decisive question that nobody 
but a wise and brave woman can answer, Why can not the girls of America be 
admittted inside the iron gate through which their brothers pass intothe enchanted 
land of the higher education? 
Happily for her and the cause she so magnificently represented for half a century, 
she was now turned aside into the ‘‘ green pastures and still waters” of a happy 
marriage, and for five years, until the age of 30, lived as the wife of Dr. John 
Willard, a physician by profession, then a high official of the State and an enthusi- 
astic political follower of Thomas Jefferson, whose educational ideas he had also 
accepted. The loss of his political office and financial reverses were the guiding 
hand of Providence to lead the young wife back to her own great vocation as the

pioneer of a superior education for young women, especially of the great world 
beyond the Berkshire Hills. It would be an untold advantage if the ‘‘lady prin- 
cipal” of the American female seminary could always, like Emma Willard, come to 
her work with a personal knowledge of the common schools of the people and a 
teacher’s experience in every grade of elementary and secondary school, crowned by 
a few years of a successful and happy marriage. The launching of thousands of 
young American girls, with only the experience of a few years spent as pupils in an 
exclusive female seminary, even ignorant of the common routine of home life, doubly 
oblivious of the nature and habits of children, not even aware there is such a 
science and art as pedagogics, into the most responsible posts of instruction, often 
the principalship of a large school for young women, is one of the least hopeful edu- 
cational signs of the times. When, in 1814, at the age of 27, furnished with that 
experience of life which to such a woman includes the best in the highest schooling, 
Emma Willard stepped forward in the reestablishment of her model school at Mid- 
dlebury, Vt., she knew just what she wanted to do. With the hearty cooperation of 
her husband, who managed the practical details of the enterprise, she succeeded in 
bringing 70 girls about her, and up in the highlands of Vermont began to draw to 
herself the daughters of the most influential people of the neighboring State of New 
York. 
She early recognized the absolute importance, in every enterprise of education, 
of keeping herself and her cause before the people. She had no respect for the 
absurd attitude of exclusiveness and overstrained public reserve by which a class 
of schools for American girls seeks the patronage of the peculiar type of families 
whose ambition seems to be to educate their daughters ‘under glass.” Emma Wil- 
lard was a woman of the people, not in the vulgar sense of being an educational dema- 
gogue, appealing to the false pride and cheap ambition of the great crowd whose desire 
is to clutch the prize of high position and eminent success without the labor by 
which no. real place m American society can be secured and retained. But she 
stepped forth at once as a superior woman, sure of her own position, knowing what 
she would do, claiming by her right as the representative of thousands of young 
American women to demand the approval and cooperation of the most influential 
men and women of the time. While yet at Middlebury she began that habit of cor- 
respondence with the most distinguished public men of the time which was so large 
an element in her future success. She wrote to President Monroe, Chancellor Kent, 
and other less celebrated but influential gentlemen in New York; unfolding her 
plans through her Jetters and a prospectus of a college for girls, carefully prepared 
by herself, and such as had not until that time been addressed to the educational 
public of the nation. 
It may be remarked that this was seven years before the city of Boston had attempted. 
to establish its free high school for girls, which after a brief existence was abolished 
and waited a generation for its resurrection. Thero were already a few schools for 
girls in New England, and fewer still in the Middle and Southern States, where the 
claims of 2 thorough and extended system of education were acknowledged. But 
these were generally of an exclusive type, accessible chiefly to the daughters of the 
educated and well-to-do families of the leading cities. Mary Lyon had not yet gone 
forth in Massachusetts on her great work of making the secondary education so cheap 
that the girls of the poorer class of farmers and mechanics could “ work their way” 
up toan educational outfit for good service in the school and church. Mrs. Willard’s 
eye was upon the whole country. She realized that New England could safely bo 
left to make its own way to the best results, while the great new world opening 
beyond the Hudson and the old States extending down the Atlantic Coast was the 
most inviting field in which to plant an institution of national proportions. 
Sho first made a lodgment in Waterford, a suburban village of Albany and Troy, 
invited by a few families whose daughters had attended her Vermont school. She 
at once attracted the attention of Governor De Witt Clinton, the foremost public 
man that had yet appeared in the State government of New York, the obstinate and
-P-A-G-E-319

intelligent friend of education in all its relations to a superior Commonwealth. By 
his approval, through his messages to the legislature and the assistance of a group 
of the foremost men then gathered about the capital, she obtained a charter for her 
school in Waterford, under the patronage, such as it was, of the board of regents, 
with the expectation of being admitted to the distribution of tho small annual 
income of the literary fund. Her application for an appropriation and endowment 
by the State, similar to that by which Union College had been lifted from the obseur- * 
ity of a small village academy to a position among the great colleges of the country, 
after two years of alternate hope and disappointment, fell to the ground, although 
backed by the great influence of the governor and other powerful friends. 
Already the persistent opposition of the denominational academy and college, 
which has always been one of the serious drawbacks of popular education in the 
States beyond the Hudson, was felt in the influence that defeated the movement 
which would have made the Mary Willard Seminary the Vassar College of New York 
half a century before its establishment at Poughkeepsie. Convinced that she had 
mistaken the source of patronage and material aid in dealing with tho legisiature, 
and with a decided sense of disillusion in her enthusiastic and reverent estimate of 
the “fathers of the State,” she turned in 1820 to the offer of the young and progress- 
ive city of Troy, then and for many years after one of the most energetic and intel- 
ligent of the new American towns. The city corporation raised $4,000 by tax. 
Another fund was raised by subscription. A brick building 60 by 40 feet, three 
stories above the basement, was erected in the very heart of the town. The building 
was rented to Dr, Willard by the city government, and in 1821 the beginning was 
made of the most celebrated school for girls that had been hitherto known in the 
New World, and according to eminent authorities no school of equal influence was ~ 
then known in Europe. . 
Her model school was now a fact, housed in a spacious building in the heart of a 
progressive and friendly community, in the best possible situation to cover the 
entiro space of the old Atlantic and new Western school public. But this was only 
the material beginning of the new education that was to be the living soul of the 
institution. She showed her wisdom by discarding the name “ college,” under which 
so many inferior schools were already masquerading before a credulous public, and 
then and always was the ‘principal of the Troy Female Seminary.” Her leading 
teachers were largely from the class of young women she had already educated, and 
her younger sister, now a young widow and an accomplished woman, for nine years 
was her alter ego in the practical work of the seminary. -She decided at once that 
while the general education in a way more exhaustive and thorough than had hith- 
erto been known was an important need of American girls as an outfit for home 
and social life, this could never be achieved until a superior race of women teachers 
was educated to take the places of the class of broken-down females, second-rate 
“masters,” and inferior instructors who were established as the principals and man- 
agers of the regulation ‘female college.” Her seminary at once became the great 
normal school for the training of young women for the office of teaching their own 
sex; the first great school that began and continued through its long and splendid 
career with this intention at its heart. 3 
To accomplish this it was necessary that a system of student aid should be inau- 
gurated, whereby a large class of superior young women, unable to incur the expense 
of $500 a year, could enjoy the opportunities of the institution, This she took in 
hand as her own vocation, and by a system of loans to her pupils, not half of which 
could ever be repaid, she expended $75,000 during the years of her principalship, one 
of the most reliable contributions to the education of woman that had been made a: 
this period of American history. 
Then came up the great necessity of the improvement of text-books suitable for 
the education of young women. She at once determined on a class of manuals higher 
than those used in the ordinary public schools, to make science, philosophy, and the 
structure and literature of the language a prominent feature in the curriculum. This  
-P-A-G-E-320
244 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
necessitated the making of suitable books of instruction. Her attention was first 
called to the study of geography, which had been only recently admitted into the 
course of study in any class of schools. Beginning with the fundamental proposi- 
tion, ‘‘However well it may be for a man to have a good knowledge of geography, 
yet it is better for him to have a sound judgment and a well-established intellect,” 
she called to her aid Mr, William C. Woodbridge, of Connecticut, the foremost prac- 
tical American geographer of his day, and in 1821 published the first American 
geography that proposed the instruction of that science by appeal to the eye through 
maps and charts and the accumulation of material in portable shape to be carried in 
the memory. In this career, as the author of a series of schoolbooks, with several 
volumes of history and science, including the famous Temple of Fame, a valuable 
chart of universal history, she persisted during her life. Her text-books at the time 
were a great step in advance, had a circulation of 1,000,000 copies, and were only 
superseded by others made in the light of past experience in the expanding move- 
ments of instruction. She was also a prolific author of articles and public addresses, 
often of great value, especially to the home and social life of American society. Her 
habit of correspondence with distinguished people in all departments of activity was 
continued till her death. She wrote a model hand, and was in the best sense a woman 
of the world—beautiful, accomplished, high principled, and tactful; but with all 
her womanly and social attainments concentrated on onc supreme interest—the eleva- 
tion of American young womanhood by the lever of an improved system of education 
of a genuine American type. 
Another and most important step was taken in her refusal to organize her school 
on the regulation denominational religious platform. Her father’s experience had 
long since made of the daughter at once a most devout and loyal member of a Chris- 
tian church, a thorough hater of bigotry, and a dissenter from the ordinary ideas of 
denominational partisanship. Her letter to Rev. Dr. Beaman, then the head of the 
Albany Protestant pulpit, declining his offer to assume the office of religious instructor 
and pastoral guide to her seminary, and outlining her own ideal of religious instruc- 
tion in a girl’s college, is still excellent reading, and at that day must have exerted 
a great influence in high educational quarters. Her plan was to leave her girls free 
to attend the church of their own choice and derive from their pastors such spiritual 
aid and comfort as might be desired. But she assumed the responsibility of giving 
a “course of instruction in the fundamentals of natural and revealed religion, being 
careful to stop at the point where the different Christian sects divide.” In a letter to 
Catherine E. Beecher, of Hartford, Conn., in 1829, she outlined her idea on the rising 
question of the generation, ‘‘ woman’s rights,” but conservative in thought, she was 
ever mindful of the fact that her own seminary was a nursery of the great idea of 
the progress of American womanhood toward the goal of equal influence in Ameri- 
can life, which is now the note of the higher society of the Republic. 
It is not remarkable that a school organized on this principle at once assumed a 
leadership in American education. Her pupils were largely drawn from the most 
influential families of the whole country and from the remarkable class of able and 
accomplished girls who sought their outfit for a career of usefulness, The pecuniary 
outcome of the institution and the liberality of her patrons placed her above the 
necessity of that demoralizing yearly hunt for pupils that so degrades, especially a 
seminary for girls. In 1825 her husband died, and, with the help of her younger 
sister, already a distinguished teacher and author of text-books and afterwards the 
principal of excellent schools in Pennsylvania and Maryland, sho assumed the entire 
control of the ctterprise with eminent success, until she delivered it into the hands 
of her son and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. John Willard, in 1838, at the end of a career of 
unexampled prosperity. After the unhappy experience of an unfortunate marriage, 
from which she disentangled herself with the resolution and common sense conspicu- 
ous in all her undertakings, she established herself as a resident in the school grounds 
of her beloved seminary at Troy and gave herself to a life of beneficent activity. She 
was greatly interested in the establishment of a school for girls in Greece. She was
-P-A-G-E-321
EARLY COMMON SCHOOLS. 245 
active in the usual charitable and missionary enterprises of the day. On several 
visits to Europe she made the acquaintance of many eminent people, and was heartily 
appreciated in the highest educational circles, being the especial friend of Maria 
Edgeworth and the Marquis de Lafayette. 
But she did not leave this world until she had crowned her long and admirable 
success by several years of valuable labor in the cause of common school education. 
The closing years of her seminary life, from 1820 to 1854, covered the central period 
in the development of the people’s common school, which is the subject of this portion 
of ouressay. Under circumstances so painful that many a noble-hearted woman would 
have fallen into despair, she found in Dr. Henry Barnard a friend and comforter. At50 
years of age she returned to her native town, and for a year, under the instruction 
and oversight of this great apostle of the new education, the superintendent of public 
schools in Connecticut, labored as a model superintendent of common schools in Ken- 
sington, a district of Berlin, with such eminentsuccess that these four country schools 
became a model for the State, and nothing but the popular reaction that threw Dr. 
Barnard out of his position and the State back for a brief time upon the failure of 
the past generation prevented her from leading in the establishment of the first 
normal school of the State. Returning to Troy, she became at once interested in the 
important movement in public instruction in the State by which the system of county 
superintendents had taken the place of the inefficient management of the boards of 
township commissioners complicated with district trusteeship. She began a series 
of extended journeys through the rural districts of the State, in which she visited 
several of the more important counties, addressed great bodies of teachers and peo- 
ple, attended large educational conventions, and in all ways illustrated what may be 
done at a critical period of the school life of a community by a ministry of education 
which includes all the elements of a Christian civilization in its comprehensive scope. 
Her last years were signalized by a patriotic and most Christian effort to stay the 
rising tide of civil war in 1860. Relying greatly on her personal influence, not real- 
izing fully that the country had come to the parting of the ways, where the final des- 
tiny of the people, in the language of Abraham Lincoln, was to be “all free or all 
slave,” she went to Washington with a memorial signed by 4,000 American women 
in her hands, which was presented to the Senate by the distinguished Senator Crit- 
tenden, of Kentucky, and by Governor Graham, of North Carolina, to the House of 
Representatives. But while this patriotic plea for peace and brotherhood failed 
of effect and was subjected to the natural misapprehension of some of the most dis- 
tinguished statesmen of both sections, it was in itself an indirect testimony to the 
peril of the neglect of universal education through vast regions of the country, 
which it has been our duty to record as a part of the educational history of the colo- 
nial and early national period. Had the wise and earnest warnings of all the great 
fathers of the Republic—Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Adams, Marshall, and 
Cutler—been followed by the early establishment of an efficient system of education, 
reaching from the country district school to the State university, and had the higher 
education of the old thirteen States been developed on the broad and practical lines 
of advance of which Union College was the most successful experiment, this dire 
calamity of the greatest civil war of modern times would have been averted and the 
national curse of negro slavery would have been abolished through the peaceful 
methods of public life, to the satisfaction of all reasonable people in all portions of 
the Union. 
But, repelled in her effort for the arrest of hostilities, Mrs. Willard fell at once into 
her own place as a most intense and patriotic supporter of the Union cause, as far as 
her advanced age and afflictions would permit. She died in 1870, at the age of 83, 
her life haying been consecrated for sixty-six years, from the age of 17, to the grand 
ministry of education. It is doubtful whether any woman in American life has lived 
out her career in a way more womanly, with such profit to so many young women, 
with such an amplitude of influence ranging through all departments of society. 
Her pupils had beer. nux>exad by the thousand. Her text-books had been used by
-P-A-G-E-322
  246 EDUCATION REPORT, 1395-96. 
multitudes of the most influential teachers in the country. Her labors for common 
schools were appreciated not only in two States but known all over the land. Her 
seminary became the model for many schools, and her teachers carried her plans and 
the spirit of her instruction to every State in the Union. 
Emma Willard doubtless had her limitations and weaknesses, like all who live on 
the high plane of human estimation. But when we met her for the first time, in 1860, 
still as enthusiastic as a young schoolmistress, in attendance on the annual examina- 
tion of the Troy Female Seminary, we felt that it would be many a year before the 
country “would look upon her like again.” At the death of her son and his wife 
the school was suspended. But its site has been adorned by a memorial statue and 
building in the city she served so faithfully, erected by the children and descendants 
of the mothers who sat under her powerful and inspiring administration of the educa- 
tion that educates, in the noble foundation that has just been laid for the Emma 
Willard College on the site of the famous Troy Seminary. 
Meanwhile, as the period of the great national revival of the common school 
approached its inauguration in 1830-1840, the half-conscious premonition of the people 
for great impending events, always evident to the careful observer of American life, 
was more than evident in New York. The settlement of western New York, prac- 
tically the first ‘‘Great West” to the people of New England, was being rapidly stim- 
ulated by the coming of steam navigation and the building of the Erie Canal. It 
was a prophetic instinct of his future that sent young William H. Seward from his 
home in Florida, Orange County, on the Hudson, first to Union College and after- 
wards to Auburn, then a new village on the extreme frontier, as his place of abode. 
The new population of the State west of Schenectady -was largely of New England 
origin, who brought to their beautiful new homes the peculiar habit of “spreading 
themselves” and ‘stirring up things”—chief among all things the opportunity for 
the education of the whole people. We have seen that a memorial from the new city 
of Rochester had already made a stir in the legislature. The educational journal of 
Francis Dwight, printed first in one of the western towns of the State, had awakened 
an interest. The great influence of James Wadsworth in the establishment of dis- 
trict schoel libraries and generally in the advocacy of popular schools was a power-~ 
ful addition to the movement. The interesting experiment of the ‘‘public school 
society” in the chief gity of New York had demonstrated two things: (1) That the 
people of that metropolis would demand a system of popular education free from 
ecclesiastical direction; (2) That it was becoming apparent that no private organ- 
ization, however respectable and above suspicion of sinister motive, could con- 
tinue to handle the educational affairs of a great city. The association metits death- 
blow in the great debate on ‘Religion in the common schools,” precipitated by 
Archbishop Hughes in the interest of subsidizing the parochial schools of his church. 
The outcome of this able discussion was that, while the vast majority of the people 
indorsed the conclusions of the opponents of this scheme, their own argument would 
upset any private organization in its attempt to make the State tributary to its 
plan of the education of the masses. The way was thus paved for the dissolution of 
the public school society and its absorption into the common school board of the 
city. In the vote in 1851 on the acceptance of a free-school system by the State, the 
favorable majorities in the cities of New York and Albany were the most decisive in 
the Commonwealth; indeed, with a few smaller cities, constituted the entire majority. 
The endeavor to subsidize the academies for the training of teachers for the com- 
mon schools, although a disappointment to the friends of public education, kept 
alive the conviction that the teaching force of the State must be improved and that 
only the people in their primary function of founder, supporter, and supervisor of 
public education was competent for its success. 
In 1836 could be seen a group of important schools that were making the capital 
city, Albany, the most important center of education for a generation to come. 
Among the admirable public men whose careers make it easy to believe all that may 
- be affirmed of the influence of the original emigration from Holland in the making

of the Empire State was Stephen Van Rensselaer, of the great family whose posses- 
sions included a good part of the three counties of Albany, Rensselaer, and Columbia. 
Born in affluence and connected by marriage with the most conservative, social, and 
political class in the Commonwealth, he was in fact one of the most liberal and far- 
seeing of the statesmen of his day. He was a member of the legislature and Con- 
gress; lieutenant-governor and candidate for governor of the State; one of the 
original commissioners of the Erie Canal, and an associate with De Witt Clinton in 
that important enterprise. He was the foremost and most important member of the 
State Agricultural Society and the promoter of the first geological survey of the 
eastern portion of the State. At the opening of the Erie Canal he sent an eminent 
popular lecturer on a tour of its entire extent to wake up an interest in natural 
science by free addresses, illustrated with apparatus and instructions for the collec- 
tion of cabinets. In 1826 ho projected the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy, 
with the hope of support from the legislature. Defeated in this, like Mrs. Willard, 
he supported this important school of the high industrial scientific type largely at 
his own expense for fourteen years. 
This concentration of schools of the secondary and agher education around the 
capital city, Union College, tho Rensselaer School of Technology, and Mrs. Willard’s 
seminary at Troy, with the Albany male and female academies, was making Albany 
the most important educational centet of the State. The growing interest in his- 
torical literature shown by the increasing importance of the State library, under 
the directorship of Dr. Homes, one of the most valuable collections for the use of a 
public man in the country, tho establishment of the medical and law departments of 
the projected State university, the foundation of the geological and other scientific 
surveys of the State illustrated by the fine collections in Geological Hall, the annual 
gathering in the city of the most accomplished and influential body of people around 
the legislature, the appearance on the field of politics of a younger generation of 
public men, Thurlow Weed, and the famous group that followed the fortunes of 
William H. Seward, reinforced later by Horace Greeley and Henry J. Raymond, 
representing the rising power of the new metropolitan journalism, itself almost a 
department of the common school, the rise of the corresponding agency, the popu~ 
lar lecture that culminated in the period of the great civil war, the appearance in 
Albany of a remarkable group of young artists, Page, the Harts, Palmer, Boughton, 
Thompson, and others, the great influence of the largo body of capable political 
speakers in which New York then surpassed all States and sections of the Union— 
all these developments of a broad culture were prophetic of a revival of ihe people’s 
common school as the corner stone on which the fabric of the secondary, higher, and 
all true education must rely for its permanent foundation. 
The board of regents still held on at the capital city a respectable, almost vener- 
able, testimonial in behalf of what should be attempted by the Commonwealth, 
And, finally, the great uprising in the East in favor of popular education, responded 
to by the Corresponding revival in the new Northwest, was calling as with a 
thousand voices to the Empire State to add to allits previous honors the crowning 
» distinction of the leadership of the American people in a new organization and 
administration of the American common school. 
NEW JERSEY. 
A popular historian of New Jersey prefaces the first chapter of his elaborate 
account of the schools of the State by the flattering announcement: “From the 
first, New Jersey was in advance of every American State in education.” The 
record of the educational achievement of this colony previous to the Revolutionary 
epoch already made in a previous essay will explain the significance of this remark 
and illustrate the patriotic intention of the average local American historian to mag- 
nify his own beloved Commonwealth at the expense of its neighbors. In one 
respect it may possibly be said that New Jersey, from the first, was in advance of 
   
-P-A-G-E-324
  248° EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
all other of the American States. This wasin the persistence with which the ecele- 
siastical idea of the sectarian parochial schools was kept before the people by the 
leading clergy and the churches of every religious body for more than two hundred 
years. £ 
The history of education in New Jersey, among the older colonies, in one respect 
is almost an anticipation of the record of the State of Indiana in the new Northwest. 
In both these important States the American common school fought its way up to 
its complete establishment against the intense and persistent opposition of a hostile 
party composed of the most influential classes of the Commonwealth. In Indiana 
the conflict was greatly complicated for a term of years by the efforts to establish 
negro slavery as a permanent institution, although the jealousy of the Southern 
religious leaders was an important feature in the contest. But in New Jersey there 
was a long delay of two hundred and fifty years in securing the possession of a 
system of free common schools for the masses of the people, which brings us down 
to the year 1871. 
We have already seen how at once on the settlement of the colony in 1638 the 
Dutch, Swedish, and afterwards the Quaker settlers established, in connection with 
each of the churches, a school of the sect, though in many of the communities the 
people relied on the clergy for the secular schooling of their children. We have 
also seen how absolutely inefficient was this method of overcoming the illiteracy 
which, in the early period of colonization, was the most dangerous foe of civilization, 
and how abortive were the efforts of the people, up to the era of the Revolution, to 
obtain a good working system of instruction outside the limits of sectarian domi- 
nation. We have also borne testimony to the praiseworthy efforts of the Presbyte- 
rian people in the establishment of the College of New Jersey and the building up 
of several important academic schools, as well as the extended influence through the 
Southern colonies of eminent educators sent from Princeton to the headquarters of 
the Southern higher education. The statement that the appropriation of an island 
opposite the present city of Burlington, N. J., for educational purposes in 1683 was 
the first school fund in America, is disposed of by the fact that in every American 
colony from the first similar appropriations for local purposes were constantly being 
made. The permissive law passed by the colonial legislature in 1693 has also been 
shown to have been practically of no avail. The same influence that persisted until 
1838 against the founding of a public school system and, even until 1850, left the 
common school in a state that exposed it to the contempt of its friends, could be 
trusted to nullify the success of any permissive scheme of public schooling. Indeed, 
until 1838 the entire school legislation of the State was retarded by the provision 
which required that the State moneys distributed to the towns should be expended 
only for the elementary schooling of children of paupers and the poorer class of the 
people. 
The first constitution of the State, established in 1787, when the new Common- 
wealth had a population of 184,000, made no mention of education. The first step to 
establish a permanent State school fund was made in 1816, when the sum of $15,000 was 
appropriated for that purpose. In 1817 this was raised to $114,000. In 1820 ‘‘the 
first general act to authorize towns to raise money for the support of schools” was 
passed in the form of a statute that remained in force till 1838, to tax the public to 
educate the children of paupers and poor people. 
In 1824 the legislature provided that one-tenth of all State taxes should go to the 
increase of the school fund. In 1828 the people of the towns were authorized to 
raise money in town meeting for the building of schoolhouses. In the same year, 
1828, the friends of an efficient school system seem to have made their first impor- 
tant demonstration. A committee of education appointed a ‘‘ central committee” 
to work in connection with local committees to canvas the State and collect statis- 
tics of general educational import. The result was another demonstration, if such 
were needed, of the inability of any system of parochial schools either to furnish 
the means of education or to persuade the people to avail themselves of what was on

the ground. It was found that more than one-third the children of the State were 
in no school. Some of the counties in their reports showed an advanced spirit. 
Essex advised the establishment of a State normal school. 
The same result of the sectarian system had been reached in New York and 
Pennsylvania, After a two hundred years’ experiment in the city of New York it 
was found in 1805 that a large proportion of the children of the city were not in the 
denominational schools, and the famous Public School Society was established by 
an association of the most distinguished men of the city to meet this crying need. 
This association, the most important and unselfish of all the private combinations to 
support public education ever formed in our country, went to its destruction on the 
same reef of denominational jealousy. The same contention of sects delayed the 
coming of the common school in the great and wealthy State of Pennsylvania until 
a period later than the educational revival in New England in 1830-1840. 
The fact, always ignored or contradicted in the plan of the advocates of this 
method of supporting universal education in this Republic, is that, like many other 
things passably good in their day and generation, this is a method that can only be 
used effectively under the union of state and church. Allits proposed modifications 
in our country lead the community to the oid notion that the State shall take cogni- 
zance of the different religious sects and either stand behind one exclusively, as in 
the medival days, or, as in Great Britain at the present time, divide its bounty 
among a large number, or, as now proposed here, extend a subsidizing charity to all. 
But when ‘the people of the United States” in the organization of their General 
Government distinctly ignored and rejected all connection with ecclesiastical affairs, 
and when the people of almost every State placed a similar clause in their constitu- 
tion, the deathblow was given to this system of public education. All attempts to 
introduce it during the past one hundred years by indirection, as in Connecticut and 
New Jersey, and in local and city systems of schools, have been in open defiance of 
the fundamental American idea that no distinctions of religious creed or polity shall 
be recognized by the State ornation. It was not remarkable that a body of colonists, 
trained in the imitation of the ideas of the Europe of three centuries ago, should use 
all the machinery of their powerful church systems to influence State and city gov- 
ernments to evade or override the express will of the people; but although the con- 
test may be prolonged, as it was till 1838 in New Jersey, the final result will always 
be thesame. In this State, once relieved from this system, the people took the field, 
and since the civil war have placed New Jersey among the foremost of all States in 
the most ample provisions for the schooling of the masses, while her colleges, acad- 
emies, professional and scientific schools, rank high in the general record of the whole 
country. 
The startling revelations of the ‘central committee” of 1828 resulted in the inang- 
uration of what has been styled ‘the first comprehensive and practical school legis- 
lation” in the State. The school law of 1829 contained some important provisions, 
though still clinging to the mischievous idea that free education is only to be offered 
as a public charity to pauperism and poverty. It included: (1) A provision for an 
annual State appropriation of $20,000, to be divided among the towns in proportion 
to their tax valuation; (2) a body of town school commissioners, empowered to dis- 
trict the town for such purpose, examine teachers, inspect the schools, and report 
annually on their quality; (8) an election of school trustees in each district, who 
were authorized to provide schoolhouses and take the full control of schools; (4) the 
school age was fixed at 4 to 16, as a guide in the local distribution of State school 
funds. za 
But as in all similar contentions between the mass of the people and the powerful 
organized party of its opponents, the inevitable results came. In 1831 the ecclesi- 
astical forces captured the legislature and swept from the statute book every pro- 
vision for a practical common school system. By this law the State funds were to 
be paid not to the trustees of school districts, but directly to all sorts of schools in 
session in the town, including, of course, private and church institutions. The
-P-A-G-E-326

school district lines were abolished, and teachers were no longer required to submit 
to examination by any public board. 
Here was proposed the most complete surrender of a State government to the 
demands of the ecclesiastical power on record by any American Commonwealth since 
the inauguration of the National Government. And it is important to note the fact 
that this demand was not confined to one church, but represented practically a com- 
bination of all church organizations. In fact, the Catholic Church in our country 
has suffered the unjust imputation of being the sole opponent of the American com- 
mon school. Untila period not forty years ago the same attitude toward the system 
of public instruction was taken by a powerful section of the clergy and leading 
laity of every influential church. It is noticeable how, through the free and seem- 
ingly helpless effort of the masses of the American people during a period of almost 
three centuries, our favored land has been fully delivered from this system. This 
fact should be a significant warning to all—that, whatever temporary success may 
attend such efforts as these, the movement will go the way of all previous efforts of 
similar character, and the end will come more speedily with every advancing decade 
of the educational life of the nation. 
A seven years’ endurance of this law seems to have been the final test of the 
patience of the people of New Jersey. On July 16, 1838, the most notable conven- 
tion of the common school public ever held in the State assembled at Trenton. 
Chief Justice Hornblower presided, and Bishop Doane, of the Protestant Episcopal 
Church, presented an address to the people that remains one of the most emphatic 
and convincing arguments heard during the first section of the present century. We 
ask no apology for presenting this memorable document in full. 
THe STATE AND EpucatTIon. 
[An address to the people of New Jersey in 1838.1] 
“FELLOW-CiTIZENS: We were appointed by the convention of your own delegates 
to address you on the subject of common schools. We approach you with solicitude, 
as deeply sensible of the great importance of the interest intrusted to ug, yet, as 
freemen speaking to freemen, with prevailing confidence. 
“The points which we propose for your attention, and, if we might, would press 
into every heart, are few, simple, and practical; the necessary consequences, it 
seems to us, from principles which all admit. We say that knowledge is the uni- 
versal right of man, and we need bring no clearer demonstration than that intellee- 
‘tual nature, capable of it, thirsting for it, expanding and aspiring with it, which is 
God’s own argument in every living soul; we say that the assertion for himself of 
this inherent right, to the full measure of his abilities and opportunities, is the uni- 
versal duty of man, and that whoever fails of it thwarts the design of his Creator, 
and, in proportion as he neglects the gift of God, dwarfs and enslaves and brutifies 
the high capacity for truth and liberty which he inherits. And all experience and 
every page of history confirm the assertion, in the close kindred which has every- 
where been proved of ignorance and vice with wretchedness and slavery. And we 
say, further, that the security of this inherent right to every individual, and its 
extension, in the fullest measure, to the greatest number, is the universal interest of 
man; so that they who deny or abridge it to their fellows, or who encourage, or, 
from want of proper influence, permit them to neglect it, are undermining the foun- 
dations of government, weakening the hold of society, and preparing the way for 
that unsettling and dissolving of all human institutions which must result in 
anarchy and ruin and in which they who have the greatest stake must be the 
greatest sufferers. A lesson, clearly taught by that divine philosophy, in which the

Maker of mankind becomes their teacher, reveals the world as but one neighborhood 
and men as brethren of one family, and writes upon all social institutions these 
golden truths, the fundamentals and essentials of the true political economy, which 
neither individuals nor nations have ever disregarded with impunity: ‘All things 
whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them,’ ‘None of 
us liveth to himself,’ ‘Whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it, 
or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it;’ ‘Bear ye one another’s 
burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.’ 
“Tf the truth of these positions be established their application is self-evident, 
and there never was a nation since the world was made in which their obligation 
was so clear or its application so important. In the theory of our Constitution the 
people are the governors. In practice they ought tobe. And is ignorance the qual- 
ification for good government? Would you select aman to make your laws who can 
not read, or one who can not write to execute them? Yet the authority which 
they exercise and the abuses of which they are capable are nothing in comparison 
with theirs from whom all power proceeds, and without whose permission no wrong 
can be done. Fellow-citizens, we are republicans. Our country is our Common- 
wealth. We have all an equal share in her. Her laws are alike for the protection 
of all. Her institutions are alike for the advantage of all. Her blessings are our 
common privilege. Her glory is our common pride. But common privileges impose 
a common responsibility, and equal rights can never be disjoined from equal duties. 
The Constitution, which under God secures our liberties, is in the keeping of us all, 
It is a sacred trust which no man can delegate. He holds it for himself not only, ~ 
but for his children, for posterity, and for the world, and he who can not read it, 
who does not understand its provisions, who could not on a just occasion assert its 
principles, no more sustains the character of an American citizen than the man who 
would not seal it with his blood. 
“Tt is in vain to say that education is a private matter and that it is the duty of 
every parent to provide for the instruction of his own children. In theory it is so. 
But there are some who can not and there are more who will not make provision. 
And the question, then, is, Shall the State suffer from individual inability or from indi- 
vidual neglect? When the child who has not been trained up in the way in which 
he ought to go commits a crime against the State, the law, with iron hand, comes in 
between the parent and his offspring and takes charge of the offender. And shall 
there be provision to punish only and none to prevent? Shall the only offices in 
which the State is known be those of jailer and of executioner? Shall she content 
herself with the stern attribute of justice and discard the gentler ministries of 
mercy? It was said of Draco’s laws that they were writ with blood. Is it less true 
of any State which makes provision for the whipping post, the penitentiary, the 
scaffold, and leaves the education of her children to individual effort or precarious 
charity? It was well said by the distinguished head of our judiciary,! even more 
distinguished as the president of the late convention for common schools, ‘ The State 
has an interest in every child within her limits.’ May not still more than this with 
equal truth be said—the welfare, nay, the being, of the State is bound upin the 
character of every child? Think of the blessings which Washington, and Franklin, 
and Fulton, and Marshall have brought down upon our land. Think of the scorn 
and execration which the name of Arnold brings with it, the single name in our 
whole history at which the nation needs to blush. 
“Tf the positions be maintained that the education of the people is indispensable 
to the preservation of free institutions, and that it is therefore the duty of every free 
State to provide for the education of her children, we are prepared, fellow-citizens, 
for the inquiry, How far has provision been made for the discharge of this duty in the 
State with which we are most intimately connected—the State of New Jersey? That 
the duty of making some provision for this end has long been recognized, the twenty- 
| 1Chief Justice Hornblower, by his deportment as the presiding officer of the convention, added 
new dignity to his office and to himself.

  252 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96, 
one years which have elapsed since the passage of the first act ‘to create a fund for 
the support of free schools’ sufficiently attest. That what has been done is insufti- 
cient, you have yourselves borne witness in the general impulse which, in December 
and January last, originated so many of those primary assemblies—in our Republic 
the true sources of power and influence—for the consideration of this subject; and 
in that large, intelligent, and most respectable convention, composed of delegates 
chosen by yourselves to express your own views on the provisions for the public 
instruction, by which it was resolved with singular unanimity that ‘the general laws 
of this State on the subject of common schools are essentially defective and ought to 
be repealed.’ Into the question, ‘What shall be substituted for the present law?’ the 
convention did not enter. It was for them to declare the wishes of the people for a 
more effective system of instruction. The plan and its provisions they left. with 
perfect. confidence to the wisdom of the legislature. The course which the conven- 
tion pursued is even more becoming for us—the rather as the matter is at this very 
moment in the course of legislative action. And after all, fellow-citizens, the ques- 
tion what the law is, is by no means so important as the question, What is public 
sentiment? ‘If the people are but right the legislature never will be greatly wrong; 
or if they should, the remedy is easy and the cure infallible. 
“Omitting all considerations, then, of what has been or of what may be legislative 
enactments on the subject, we address you as the sovereign people, and we say that 
it is your duty and your highest interest to provide and to maintain, within the reach 
of every child, the means of such an education as will qualify him to discharge the 
duties of a citizen of the Republic, and will enable him, by subsequent exertion, in 
the free exercise of the unconquerable will, to attain the highest eminence in knowl- 
edge and in power which God may place within his reach. We utterly repudiate as 
unworthy, not of freemen only, but of men, the narrow notion that there is to be an 
education for the poor as such. Has God provided for the poor a coarser earth, a 
thinner air, a palersky? Does not the glorious sun pour down his golden flood as 
cheerily upon the poor man’s hovel as upon the rich man’s palace? Have not the 
cotter’s children as keen a sense of all the freshness, verdure, fragrance, melody, and 
beauty of luxuriant nature as the pale sons of kings? Oris it on the mind that God 
has stamped the imprint of a baser birth, so that the poor man’s child knows with an 
inborn certainty that his lot is to crawl, not climb? Itis not so. God has not done 
it. Man can not doit. Mind isimmortal. Mind is imperial. It bears no mark of 
high or low, of rich or poor. It needs no bound of time or place, of rank or cireum- 
stance. It asks butfreedom. Itrequires but light. Itis heaven born, and it aspires 
to heaven. Weakness doos not enfeeble it. Poverty can not repress it. Difficulties 
do but stimulate its vigor. And the poor tallow chandler’s son that sits up all the 
night to read the book which an apprentice lends him, lest the master’s eye should 
miss it in the morning, shall stand and treat with kings, shall add new provinces to 
the domain of science, shall bind the lightning with a hempen cord and bring it 
harmless from the skies.’ The common school is common, not as inferior, not as the 
school for poor men’s children, but as the light and air are common. It ought to be 
the best school because it is the first school; and in all good works the beginning is 
one-half. Who does not know the value to a community of a plentiful supply of the 
pure element of water? And infinitely more than this is the instruction of the com- 
mon school; for it is the fountain at which the mind drinks and is refreshed and 
strengthened for its career of usefulness and glory. 
“Fellow-citizens, it is the wise ordinance of God that man shall work for what 
he values. In all the dealings of your ordinary life you act upon the principle. 
You plow your fields. You urge your spindles. You ply your fisheries. You tend 
your shops. With sweat of brow or sweat of brain each precious thing that man 
possesses must be gained and kept. Atno less price can liberty and its attendant 
blessings be enjoyed. ‘That which makes a good constitution,’ said wise and pru-

dent William Penn,! ‘must also keep it, men of wisdom and virtue; qualities which, 
because they descend not with inheritance, must be carefully propagated by a virtu- 
ous education of youth.’ Ask not, then, when we enjoin on you the duty of pro- 
viding for the public instruction, where the cost shall come from? Were your house 
beset with robbers, would you stop to ask the cost of its defense? If an invading 
army were to land to-morrow on our shores, must we stop to count the cost before 
we march to meet and to repel them? The common schools are in the place to us of 
arms and troops and fleets. They are our nurseries of men. They are indeed ‘the 
cheap defense of nations.’ 
What constitutes a State? Not high-raised battlements or labored mound, 
Thick wall, or moated gate; 
Not cities proud, with spires and turrets crowned, 
Not bays and broad-armed ports, 
Where, laughing at the storm, rich navies ride; 
Not starred and spangled courts, 
Where low-browed baseness wafts perfume to pride. 
No—Men, high-minded Men. 
‘Men who their duties know, 
But know their rights, and, knowing, dare maintain; 
Prevent the long-aimed blow, 
And crush the tyrant, while they rend the chain: 
These constitute a State.? 
  ‘«Fellow-citizens, it is for you to say what shall be the present character, what 
shall be the future destiny of New Jersey. We have indeed a goodly heritage, but 
it has been long and shamefully neglected. We have undervalued our privileges. 
We have overlooked our duties. We have been eontent to be a pendent merely, 
when we ought to be an independent State. There is now, thank God, the sound as 
of a trumpet in the land that stirs the old heroic blood. We feel the remnant sparks 
of the forgotten fire which warmed our fathers’ hearts. The spirit of the elder day 
is breathing on us with its quickening and invigorating power. Let us accept the 
omen. Let us obey the noble impulse. Let us arise to duty and to glory. Men 
of New Jersey, it is you that are to rise. You are the State. You create and you 
control the legislature. You enact and you sustain the laws. Yours are the means. 
Yours is the influence, Yours is the work. You make, you are the State. Goon as 
you have now begun. The system of common schools which shall be adopted by the 
present legislature, take into your own hands. If it is not what it should be, see 
that the next legislature make it such. Act together. Act with system. Act like 
men. The organization for the purpose is complete. The general committee, the 
committees of correspondence for the counties, the committees of the townships— 
there is not an inch of ground that is not reached; there is not a citizen of New Jer- 
sey whose heart may not be roused by this electric chain. Lay to your hands, then, 
and employ it well. The work is great, and great must be the effort, and great the 
confidence. You must trust yourselves. You must trust your fellow-citizens. You 
must trust the legislature. A system of public instruction is a great and arduous 
enterprise. You must repose such confidence in those who are to frame it as shall 
enable them to do it well. When it is framed you will do wisely to commit its over- 
sight, subject to legislative supervision, to a judicious board,® selected carefully from 
your most tried and faithful men, with wisdom to direct and with devotion to exert

8 It is said that there are prejudices against a board of education and a superintendent. We can 
hardly think that they are general. “If so, our appeal is to the good, sterling, common sense of the 
people of New Jersey. Is there a turnpike road, or a steamboat, or a bank, or a cotton factory, whose 
affairs are not intrusted to a board of managers? Is there a mill in all the State without a miller, or 
a locomotive in the land without an engineer? Is the education of the people less important than 
all these? Oris the system of public education to be the only case of a machine that goes alone?

its powers. Above all, give the direction of the engine, with a large and liberal 
discretion, to a skillful engineer. And when it is made and manned, and set in 
operation, you must still support it; you must watch over it; you must be yourselves 
apart of it. The school fund is not equal to the work. And if it were, it would 
not be so well for you. Tax yourselves for the support of common schools and you 
will never be in danger of taxation from a foreign power—you will need less taxa- 
tion for the support of pauperism and the punishment of crime. Look to your 
schoolhouses. Seo that they are convenient of access, that they are comfortable, 
that they are neat and tasteful. Look to the teachers. See that they are taught 
themselves and apt to teach; men that fear God and love their country. Sec that 
they are well accommodated, well treated, wellremunerated. Respect them and they 
will respect themselves, and your children will respect them. Look to the scholars. 
Have them much in your eye, and always in your heart. Remember you are to grow 
old among them. Remember you are to die and leave your country in their hands. 
“Good common schools,’ says Goyernor Everett, of Massachusetts, ‘are the basis 
of every wise system of popular education.’ This is precisely what they are, tho 
basis of a system; but the basis only. Let us now lay their broad foundations deep 
and strong—foundations that will stand themselves and bear the noble structure 
which our children and our children’s children, as wo trust, will rear upon them. 
Wo are the citizens of a small State. We can not, by our votes, control tho 
electoral college. We can not, by our political influence, aspire to be the Empire 
State of the confederacy. But there is a nobler empire, whose dominion does not 
come by numbers or by physical power. We may aspire, if we are just to ourselves 
and to our opportunities, to wield the suffrage of mind. The men of Athens were 
but few, their territory small, their soil indifferent, yet did Athenian arms prevail 
against tho myriads of the East; and to Athenian letters and Athenian arts admir- 
ing nations still award the palm. In the same noble lists let us engage; and make ~ 
the mastery of intellect the prize of our ambition. Let us devote ourselves and con- 
secrate the State to the great work of education. Let us lay hold in earnest of the 
remarkable advantages which we possess in this respect, in our accessible position, 
our temperate climate, our freedom from absorbing interests, the moderate habits, 
and the simple manners of our people. Let us sustain our present seats of learning; 
and let kindred institutions in every varied form be multiplied about us. Let us 
collect the children of the land, and on their minds make the mark which shall go 
down to latest generations. Let other States excel in commerce, or in agricul- 
ture, or in manufactures. But let the staple of our State be mind; the products of 
our soil, with God to bless the culture, knowledge, and patriotism, and virtue; our 
highest object and our noblest aim to be the State of common schools, academics, 
and colleges—the educating State, the nursery of freemen.” 
      
The event proved that the convention had not mistaken the purpose of the influ- 
ential and progressive majority of the people. The legislature of the following win- 
ter repealed the law of 1831, and reenacted substantially the act of 1829, revised and 
improved. In this act the limitation of the State educational bounty to the children 
of paupers and the poor disappeared forever. The State appropriation was raised 
to $30,000 annually, the money to be given exclusively to public schools—the town- 
ships required to raise $2 for every $1 received from the State, the moneys to be dis- 
tributed to all, a board of examiners for each county authorized to examine teachers, 
the minimum of the school age fixed at 5 years, and district lines restored. A sup- 
plementary act in 1845 established a general superintendency of schools over the 
two most advanced counties, with the power to accept the same privilege by the 
other counties at their own choice. This took place in 1846, and from this first rec- 
ognition of the common school idea dates the real progress of popular education in 
New Jersey. 
But the actual condition of the common schools in the country may be gathered 
from the report of Mr. H. F. King, first State superintendent in 1848. His plan for

‘increased appropriations, new legislation to aid in building and furnishing school- 
houses, to enforce general attendance on school, and for the establishment of school’ 
libraries, with an eloquent plea to the friends of education, is enforced by the most 
graphic picture of the actual condition of affairs. 
In 1844-1846 the following articles were placed in the revised constitution of New 
Jersey: 
“ARTICLE IVY.—Section 7.—The fund for the support of free schools, and all money, 
stock, and other property, which may hereafter be appropriated for that purpose, or 
receiyed into the treasury under the provision of any law heretofore passed to aug- 
ment the said fund, shall be securely invested and remain a perpetual fund; and the 
income thereof, except so much as it may be judged expedient to apply to an increase 
of the capital, shall be annually appropriated to the support of public schools for 
the equal benefit of all the people of the State; andit shall not be,competent for the 
legislature to borrow, appropriate, or use the said fund, or any part thereof, for any 
other purpose under any pretense whatever.”   
PENNSYLVANIA. 
It is the privilege of the Christian patriot to belicve that to every American State 
in its most vital and sacred interest, the education of its children for American 
citizenship, there comes once in its history a leader who is not only an educator of 
unquestioned ability but an apostle of universal education. Such an one was James 
Pyle Wickersham, superintendent of common schools of the State of Pennsylvania 
from 1866 to 1881. Born in the State, of good English stock, a country schoolmaster 
at the age of 16, and from that age on until his honorable public career termi- 
nated in an appointment as minister of the United States to Denmark, holding" 
almost every office of importance, local and State, in educational affairs; creator 
and principal of the first State normal school at Millersburg, State superintendent 
during the fifteen most important years of the development of the present system 
of public instruction, with a hand in every good movement for educational reform; 
president of State and national teachers’ associations, chief architect of the famous 
system of teachers’ institutes of the State, and author widely read and of extended 
influence, universally respected by the foremost educators of the country, he would 
seem to have been to his native Commonwealth what Benjamin Franklin became to 
the entire colonial life, the representative of good schooling and good training for 
the new type of American civilization that emerged from the clouds and thunders of 
the great civil war. 
It will be a grateful task to give a fit record of his administration as State super- 
intendent of schools at the proper place in asubsequent work. But here it may well 
be said that in no way has he better served the educational public of the country 
than by the closing work of his life, the admirable History of Education in Penn- 
sylyania, published in 1886. As a careful and judicial record of the evolution of the 
American common scheol out of a most complex tangle of hostile elements and 
environments, it is invaluable to the student of our national educational history. 
As a conclusive argument for all that has yet been achieved by the American common 
school, clothed in the garb of a charming historical narrative and glowing with the 
patriotic appreciation of the radical significance of universal education to a repub- 
lican state, it will attract and inspire while it instructs. Had many States of the 
Union been so fortunate in the attempt to narrate their educational history, a work 
like the present would have been almost an impertinence. His book stands alone, 
yet a model for the coming race of enthusiastic young scholars who will discover a 
new field of historical investigation in the story of the American system of universal 
education, without which the history of academies, universities, and all private 
ecclesiastical and corporate schools of the secondary and higher culture must be 
fragmentary and often misleading. No apology is needed for making this record of 
the educational history of Pennsylvania from 1785 to 1840 practically an abstract

256 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
of the copious narrative of this author, with our own comment on what seems to 
be the occasional bias of citizenship of his own great Commonwealth. 
The reader who comes from our account of the educational status of the province 
of Pennsylvania to the story of the first half century of its history as one of the most 
important States of the new Republic, will not be surprised at the statement that 
at the beginning and the close of the Revolutionary war were the most unprom- 
ising periods of its educational condition at any time in its history. The State then 
had a population of 350,000, outside a few important centers thinly sprinkled over a 
vast area of 45,215 square miles. The old-time interest inspired by William Penn, 
Franklin, Rush, and other laborers in education, was largely local and municipal, 
and offered few opportunies for the rural districts. The main achievement so far had 
been the establishment of several reliable schools in Philadelphia, including the 
University and the Friends’ public school. The different religious denominations 
were, as usual, at their work of establishing education on sectarian lines, although 
sonie of them, like the Presbyterians, had a broader outlook beyond their own house- 
hold of faith than others. But then, as for an entire generation afterwards, the 
children of the common people were sacrificed on the altars of nationality, sec- 
tarianism, and social discrimination. ‘In 1775 not only was the number of scholarly 
men in the province small, but comparatively few grown persons could do more than 
read, write, and calculate according to the elementary rules of arithmetic, and many 
remained wholly illiterate.” ‘‘ The college, the Friends’ public school, the academy 
at Germantown, and scarcely a half dozen private classical schools in the older 
settled counties, with in allan attendance of 300 or 400 students, absolutely exhaust 
the advantages of this character enjoyed at home by our Revolutionary fathers.” 
In 1776 the first provisional constitution was formed for the State, and in it we find 
the following provisions concerning education: ‘A school or schools shall be estab- 
lished in each county by the legislature for the correct instruction of youth, with 
such salaries to the masters paid by the public as may enable them to instruct youth 
at low prices, and all useful learning shall be duly encouraged and promoted in one 
or more universities.” In 1789-90 the subject of education came before the conven- 
tion on constitutional revision, and here was the first great ‘‘ general engagement” 
of the opposing forces of universal education in the new Commonwealth. Under the 
lead of Timothy Pickering, a native of Massachusetts and a resident of the portion 
of Pennsylvania settled from New England, a proposition was made for a constitu- 
tional recognition of the New England system of general education. Defeated in 
this, Mr. Pickering substituted a compromise measure, under which the battle for 
the free education of the whole people was fought with varied success until 1874. 
This clause in the revised constitution of 1790 reads as follows: 
“ArticLe VII.—Section 1.—The legislature shall, as soon as conveniently may be, 
provide by law for the establishment of schools throughout the State in such manner 
that the poor may be taught gratis. 
“2, The arts and sciences shall be promoted in one or more seminaries of learning.” 
Meanwhile the legislature had made provision for an indiscriminate appropriation 
of public lands to seminaries of all sorts and conditions. For years it seemed chiefly 
to concern the fathers of the State to “aid the church and neighborhood schools in 
carrying forward the work in which they had been engaged for a hundred years.” 
Between 1790 and 1834, the period now under consideration, “there were contributed 
funds to one university, five colleges, and about sixty academies, one in nearly every 
county of the State, a sum amounting to $400,000 or $500,000.” In this way did the 
antipublic school sentiment of the State interpret the provision of the constitution, 
“for the establishment of schools.” None of these ‘‘seminaries” were under State 
control, although some of them seem to have been under the direction of officials 
elected by the people of the county, and most of them were required to educate a cer- 
tain number of ‘poor, gratis.” The only provision of the legislature appropriating 
60,000 acres of land for public schools failed of effect, the land having been appro- 
priated to themselves by the academies, which were practically the only efficient

educational power in the field. It was twenty-five years from the founding of the 
State and the first constitutional provision for education before the Commonwealth, 
in 1802, provided by general statute for the free instruction of the poor, 
A rally was made by the friends of a common school system in 1794, and a bill con- 
taining the elements of such a scheme was drawn by the educational committee, and 
passed by both houses, but lost in conference. This was the last distinctive effort 
for a general system of public instruction until the law of 1834, forty years later; the 
educational Gettysburg of Pennsylvania, which permanently crippled the forces of 
the opposition. But, as in the great civil war, the hostile force, though grievously 
wounded, held on for an obstinate resistance through another period, including the 
passing of several generations of the children of the State. 
In 1802 an act was passed to ‘‘provide for the education of the poor class, gratis.” 
This act, renewed in 1804, and somewhat improved in 1809, remained in operation 
until the radical change in the policy of the State occurred in 1834. It is said that 
“this act did not provide for the establishment of a single school, nor did it attempt 
to regulate in any way the existing schools it proposed to patronize.” ‘It compelled 
parents to make a public record of their poverty, to ~pauperize themselves, and to 
send their children to school with this invidious mark upon them.” Here did Penn- 
sylvania, for the first half century of the National Union, cast in her lot with Vir- 
ginia and the South rather than with New England and New York, in her policy for 
the noneducation of the masses of the people. The meager endowments of acade- 
mies and colleges were good in their way. This was probably the only way then 
available in the state of public opinion by which the State could grant material aid 
to education. It not only discriminated in favor of the more prosperous classes, 
but, what was more harmful, built up a great educational interest that for more 
than half a century fought the common school idea at every point, and to this day 
remains victorious at the most vital department in the school system of a State—the 
organization and administration of the normal seminaries in which are trained the 
teachers for the common schools of the people. 
But, as in Virginia and the South, this policy from the first was obliged to contend 
against an able, zealous, and persistent minority. The common school public was 
always a force not to be despised in Pennsylvania, and here, as in the State of New 
York, the truth ‘‘hid from the-wise and prudent” fathers in the church and great 
schools was ‘‘revealed unto the babes” who, during all these years, pleaded the 
cause of the people. From the first, without a notable exception, the governors of 
Pennsylvania persisted in calling the attention of the legislature to its economical 
policy in educational matters, and in every instance a report was laid before that 
body in which the advantages of universal education under the patronage of the 
State were pictured clearly and often with extraordinary power. A stout volume 
could be gathered even of extracts from these messages and reports which would 
not only present the fundamental principles of public education, but furnish a series 
of admirable themes for public declamation by the school children of to-day. There 
is no want in the literature of public education so pressing as a series of works of this 
character in every State, containing the whole or copious extracts from these utter- 
ances of distinguished public men on the subject of general education. And no refu- 
tation so complete for every educational heresy now afloat could be furnished as these 
classics, the high-water mark of American statesmanship, with an accompaniment of 
comment showing “with what a price” has this people of the United States bought 
this bounteous provision of the American common school. 
In 1812 a supplementary law to the statute of 1809 was passed for the special bene- 
fit of the city of Philadelphia, authorizing the county commissioners to establish © 
public schools in such manner as the council of the city of Philadelphia and adjacent 
municipal districts should approve. Six years later Philadelphia was declared ‘‘the 
first school district of Pennsylvania,” with the power to provide a system of educa- 
tion on the Lancasterian plan, at public expense. This included the provision for 
ED 96. 9

  258 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
“ta model school,” in which the older children and youth were supposed to be pre- 
pared to teach under this the most imperfect and wasteful method of public educa- 
tion that ever deluded the American people. Under this loose-jointed arrangement 
one master was placed in charge of a great school of several hundred children, his 
only assistants being such of the older pupils as could be intrusted with the teach- 
ing and discipline of the younger classes. Here was sown the seeds of the disease 
that so Jong, like a malaria in the vitals, has cursed the common school systems of 
all the English-speaking peoples; the belief that anybedy and everybedy, from an 
impecunious dame to a green school boy or girl, is good enough to be placed in the 
most responsible educational position—the elementary training of thechild. To call 
this ‘‘model school” of Philadelphia the ‘‘oldest normal school in the United States” 
is a misrepresentation of the true idea of a State or city training school for teachers, 
Its claim to this high compliment is less than that of any respectable academy or 
college that in giving a youth a competent general education does lay the founda- 
tions of success in the work of instruction aceording to the maxim “You can teach 
only what you know and as you know it.” Under the ineubus of this theory the 
city of Philadelphia and several of the larger towns in Pennsylvania established 
schools, all of which died a natural death.as soon as the people of the State woke up 
to their duty of placing on the ground a genuine system of common instruction, free 
from the old discrimination in favor of poverty, in 1834. 
Dr. Wickersham gives a copious list of the various local, church, and charity 
schools by which the people of Philadelphia for almost half a century attempted in 
good faith to educate the children. As carly as 1800 there were more than 200 pri- 
yate schools taught by women in the city. Chief among them was the benevolent 
system of the Quakers, who supported, in connection with the Friends’ Public 
School, 14 charity schools in 1824. The University of Pennsylvania until a later 
date also supported a system of elementary schools. Dr, Benjamin Rush and Bishop 
White labored to build up the original English system of Sunday schools, in which 
elementary instruction in the ‘three r’s” was combined with moral and religious 
eatechising, for the benefit of the children of the poor. The city was long handi- 
capped by, and to-day bears the marks of, these false methods of dealing with the 
illiteracy of the less-favored classes. It was the perpetuation of the “good old 
way,” a superior class bending down to a lower class to dispense such ‘aid and 
comfort,” mental and spiritual, as in its estimation will be adapted to fit and not 
unfit the children of want in preparing for their proper'sphere of life. 
And when, in 1818, the city woke up to the idea of a reconstruction of its scatter- 
ing and wasteful separate, denominational, and privatétfforts, it still looked abroad 
for leadership and invited Lancaster himself to the superintendence of the new sys- 
tem of Lancasterian schools. This famous educator was born in humble circum- 
stances in London, where, in the attempt to breast the great flood of lower class 
ignorance and dependence in the England of the eighteenth century, he openeda 
school in his father’s honse for the poor children of the neighborhood in 1778. As 
the school grew he was forced to call on the assistance of his older pupils for instruc- 
tion. The system caught the fancy of distinguished people; was appreciated by 
King George the Third; and, under the leadership of Laneaster, attracted attention 
among the literati and educators. A great number of schools under what was named 
“The Lancasterian System,” were established in Great Britain. Of course, some 
people were aided by this crude arrangement and, under the name ‘“ Model Schools,” 
a sort of normal school system was established. 
The people of the city of New York, in 1805, discouraged by the failure of the 
. attempt of the different religious sects to educate the children of the city, sent a 
deputation to England to examine the system. The famous ‘Public School Society,” 
that for forty years attempted to deal with the problem of public education in the 
metropolis, adopted this scheme of instruction. It won the approval of several 
eminent statesmen, De Witt Clinton giving it a persistent support. In 1818 the city 
of Philadelphia was moved by the same excitement. Lancaster himself was brought
-P-A-G-E-335
  EARLY COMMON SCHOOLS. 259 
to the city and placed at the head of the new system of schools. He remained several 
years in the State. He was invited to South America, at the suggestion of Presi- 
dent Bolivar, in 1823, But the public interest had greatly declined when he returned. 
He lived in Philadelphia in sickness and poverty, only relieved by death that came 
to him in New York by accident, in 1838. In 1824 a system of infant schools was 
established in Philadelphia which resulted in the support of 30 elementary institu- 
tions at public expense. 
All these schemes for public education, including the Lancasterian scheme of 1818, 
were simply devices for educating the children of the poor. . Neither the State nor 
the city rose out of this old European delusion that common schools were only for 
“tho common people,” even the lower grade of the unlettered class, until half a 
century after the organization of Pennsylvania as a Commonwealth of the highest 
grade, While great good came from this benevolent care of the poor by the moro 
favored portion of the people, like all similar charities, the permanent influence was 
un-American and mischievous. It fixed in the mind of several generations of the 
superior people of that wealthy and cultivated city a pernicious idea that a “ com- 
mon school” is no place for the education of a child of good parentage and comfort- 
able means, a popular notion which, until tke last twenty years, made the second 
city of the Union perhaps the least favorable example of popular education of any 
community of similar importance in the Republic. ‘Philadelphia had no free 
schools open to the children of the rich and poor alike until the law of 1818 had been 
amended in 1836 so as to admit all children without distinction.” 
The able historian of education in Pennsylvania says of the Laneasterian scheme: 
“‘In most respects [it was] a mere show or sham that ought not to have deceived 
anybody, but it required an experiment of twenty years in Philadelphia to expose 
its defects.” One good, result was brought out of the ‘‘model school,” by a bold 
figure of speech called ‘The First Normal School in America.” This institution 
finally became the Philadelphia Public Normal and High School for Girls, similar to 
the Girls’ Normal College in the city of New York. In this arrangement a depart- 
ment for training common school teachers was combined with a public high school 
for girls. At the present time this department of pedagogics is separated from the 
general High School for Girls and has recently been housed in one of the most 
admirable public school buildings in the country. In 1834 the city of Philadelphia 
had 20 public schools, 31 teachers, and 6,767 pupils. The ten years succeeding the 
reorganization in 1834 multiphed the number of schools tenfold, there being in 1843 
214 schools, 499 teachers, and 33,130 pupils. 
But the common school public of Pennsylvania through all these years represented 
aslowly rising tide, every decade encroaching upon the powerful influence which, 
wedded to the older system of subsidizing clementary schools of all grades and 
relying upon private, corporate, and ecclesiastical agencies for secondary education, 
still held back this great Commonwealth from joining the grand army of popular 
education which had already captured the Empire State and was gathering its forces 
for the assault along the whole line in 1830-1840 which established universal educa- 
tion under State supervision as the policy of the North. 
In 1824 this resolute and aggressive minority made another effort in the legislature, 
repealed the law of 1809, and put on the statute books an act that was a positive 
advance on any previous legislation. After making a more thorough provision for 
the free education of the children of the poor this statute contained a permission to 
any community to establish a system of public schools, free to no child for a longer 
period than 3 years, supported by public taxation, school books and stationery free, and 
an examination of teachers by elected authorities. But even this advanced position 
was qualified by a provision that any religious school could be admitted to the bene- 
fit of public support, and provided that no teacher should be appointed in such 
school without the approval of its own authorities. But even this mild administra- 
tion of the public school medicine was too much for the patient at that time. The 
obnoxious act never went into operation, was repealed in 1826, and the old law of  
-P-A-G-E-336

1809 reenacted. It is not to be wondered at that Governor Shulze uttered these 
memorable words of warning in his message to the legislature in 1827-28: ‘‘Knowl- 
edge can not be supplied to all in equal measure, but it is hoped the time will come 
when none shall be left entirely destitute. Then will the legisiature truly be, in 
this respect, what the framers of the constitution desired 1t should be—a parent to 
the children of the poor; and they, in return, will have strong inducements to love, 
honor, and do their utmost to perpetuate the free institutions from which they derive 
so great a benefit, so prolific 2 source of happiness. To devise means for the estab- 
lishment of a fund and. the adaptation of a plan by which the blessings of the more 
-necessary branches of education shall be conferred on every family within our 
borders would be every way worthy the legislature of Pennsylvania.” 
The outcome of the policy of the State for the fifty years from the close of the Revo- 
Jutionary war has been tersely stated by Dr. Wickersham as embracing two objects: 
“(1) The establishment in all parts of the State of endowed academies, in which a 
small number of indigent pupils were to be taught gratuitously, mostly with refer- 
ence to their becoming teachers; and (2) the free instruction of poor children in the 
existing church or neighborhood schools.” The first object is declared by the same 
authority to have been “only a partial success.” Indeed, the policy of educating a 
body of youth in the endowed academies under a system of pauperization as teachers 
in the common schools of the State shows the popular estimate of these schools 
at the end of the first half century of the national life in this great central Com- 
monwealth of the original Union. A series of legislative reports, up to the year 
1830, reveals the more than “‘ partial failure” of the favorite system of educating the 
children of the poor. These reports show the inevitable result of this un-American 
policy in the neglect, abuse, and often absolute ignoring of the laws already in force 
There were then in the State not less than 350,000 children between 5 and 16 years of 
age. Of these, in 1828 less than 5,000 were educated at the expense of the State. The 
secretary of the legislative committee proclaims the fact, borne out by all experience 
in educational affairs, that even then the State of Pennsylvania was expending money 
enough, ‘1f applied under the control of agents familiar with the most approved 
systems of elementary instruction, to extend the benefits of an education to all the 
children within the State.” 
The unfavorable comparison drawn by Dr. Wickersham between the New England 
States and Pennsylvania, on the ground that some of these States kept:a rate bill 
attached to their school system even after Pennsylvania made her schools free, 
ignores the vital difference between Pennsylvania and her sisters of New England 
and New York. In none of these States was the public school system established or 
supported as a refuge for ‘“‘the children of the poor.” From the first, it was ‘‘a 
common school” for the whole people, good enough for all, supported and under the 
management of the whole people for their children. That for many years it exacted 
atuition fee is in accordance with the experience of every State or city in the early 
stages of its proper educational life. It was practically an impossibility for any 
American community before or for many years during the first half century of the 
national life to support an effective system of common instruction by public taxa- 
tionalone. The attempt in Connecticut was a failure and, in New York, to a late 
date, the rate bill was relied on, as now occasionally in the South, to prolong the 
schools and meet other expenses. In this respect these States did not differ from 
Pennsylvania. for all remitted tuition fees in behalf of those unable to pay. But the 
contrast appears in the radical idea of a pubhe school, In this, Pennsylvania, until 
1833, cast in her lot with the South. She did not pretend to do more than establish 
a system of free schools for the children of the poorer classes. Without the excuse 
of these States in their peculiar social and industrial organization and intensely 
aristocratic type of society, Pennsylvania, one of the most prominent, patriotic, and 
wealthy States of the North, the center of the old Union, with a persistence worthy 
of a better cause, legally till 1834, and practically till a later date, cast upon the 
American common school the blight of her public and private disapprobation, as a 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
EARLY COMMON SCHOOLS. 261 
school where only the poor, on satisfactory proof of poverty, might enjoy the meager 
opportunities, at best, found in all sorts and conditions of schools. 
The reason of this policy was found in the heterogenous elements of population in 
this great State, the firmness of its ecclesiastical organizations, the refusal of the 
seminaries of the secondary and higher learning to indorse any general system for 
the common schooling of all children at public expense, and the high aristocratic 
type of society in Philadelphia and the chief cities of the Commonwealth, That in 
due time all these different elements were persuaded or forced to unite in the sacred 
cause of popular education and that to-day Pennsylvania is one of the foremost edu- 
cational States in the Union is another testimony to the irresistible force of the 
American idea which, sooner or later, brings every community into line and will 
finally compel, by the mighty power of republican institutions, every religious 
sect, exclusive class or nationality to forget its prejudices and unite with all for 
the common welfare. The State of Massachusetts led the way about the middle of 
the eighteenth century by the common consent of its towns in making the common 
schools free to all, in this respect not only the pioneer in America but leading the 
world as the first community that, as a permanent policy of the government, sup- 
ported free schools for all its children. 
The governor of an American Commonwealth, if a wise, energetic, and broad- 
minded man, is the moral and mental barometer of the State. By a careful perusal 
of the messages of the successive chief magistrates of all the 44 American States 
from the date of their admission to the Union there could be formed a tolerably 
fair estimate of the condition of public affairs on this important interest. The 
words of Governor Shulze, of Pennsylvania, in 1828, were prophetic of a more 
elaborate utterance by Governor Wolf in 1831. This governor, under whose admin- 
istration the State finally broke out from her old inclosure of caste, creed, and 
nationality, had been a teacher himself and saw the point more clearly than any of 
his predecessors. His message was reenforced by a strong petition from the Penn- 
sylvania Society for the Reform of Public Schools and by numerous petitions from 
other sources. The chairman of the committee on education in the assembly pre- 
sented a report of great force, accompanied by a bill for a complete reconstruction 
of the educational policy of the State on a common-school basis. Although the 
legislature was not yet prepared for a movement so radical, it did pass the first law 
for the collection of a public-school State fund, providing that the proceeds of the 
public lands should be placed at interest, under the charge of a State commission, 
until the annual income should amount to $100,000, when this sum should be dis- 
tributed for the support of common schools through the communities in such a 
manner as should thereafter be provided by law. It was estimated that this fund 
would amount to $2,000,000 in 10 years. 
But now the long-hoped-for day of deliverance was at hand. The eloquent his- 
torian writes: ‘“‘The people were compelled to wander in a wilderness during one 
hundred and fifty years, and to learn wisdom from its hard lessons before they were 
permitted to enter the promised land of universal education. Up to 1830 the great 
free-school idea was either yet unborn in Pennsylvania or concealed by parents 
fearful of dangers that threatened the life of such an infant in those old times.” In 
1828 the Pennsylvania Society for the Promotion of Common Schools put a series of 
memorials before the legislature which largely contributed to bring that conserva- 
tive body to a sense of its duty to the children of the State. This society had 
Robert Vaux for its chairman, and numbered many of the most distinguished citi- 
zens of the State as its members, several hundred in all. Standing on the bed rock, 
it declared: ‘In every school system it should be a fundamental principle that every 
child should have an opportunity of receiving an education which will fit him to 
fulfill his duties.” It exposed without mercy the inevitable failure of the jumble of 
devices that for one hundred and fifty years had been forced upon the State by the 
jealous intrigues and makeshifts of the classes indifferent or intensely hostile to the 
American system of universal education for American eitizenship. In the memorial 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
of 1830 it declared, without contradiction, that of 400,000 children in Pennsylvania 
between 5 and 15 years of age not 150,000 were in all the schools of the State. 
“Many of the children never go to school at all. Multitudes are living and con- 
tinue to live in ignorance, and multitudes now receive at best the most superficial 
instruction.” 
In 1831 Governor Wolf again summoned the legislature to its obligation, but again 
the cause of the common school suffered a defeat by the negative of the senate. In 
two successive years of the legislature bills were introduced by strong reports, but 
failed of enactment. It was not till the session of 1833-34 that the gathering impulse 
acquired a consistency and push which inspired favorable hopes of success. The 
implacable governor became a very “wolf at the door” of both houses of the legis- 
Jature, and his yoice resounded louder and louder to every member of that body. 
And now, as so often in similar emergencies, another leader from ‘‘ Yankee land” 
appeared on the scene in the person of Senator Samuel Breck, of Philadelphia. This 
excellent gentleman, already on the verge of old age, had come to the legislature 
with the one view of promoting the cause of public education. He kept a diary in 
which were written his hopes and fears of the progress of the great, good cause. 
Appointed chairman of a joint committee, with a strong body of free-school mem- 
bers as associates, he made a voluminous report which was a treasure house of infor- 
mation drawn from a wide correspondence with all the more advanced States of the 
Union. The result was that in 1834 was passed, almost by unanimous consent, the 
“Act to establish a general system of education by common schools,” which com- 
mitted this great and prosperous Commonwealth finally to the American policy of 
universal education. While lacking in some of its administrative features, this law 
contained the elements of a working system of free public schools for the whole 
people. 
This law laid off the State into divisions of counties and districts, of wards and 
townships. It took one step in advance of the time in a permissive clause author- 
izing every district to introduce manual training. It also had an elective permission 
for the inspection of schools and made the secretary of state general superintend- 
ent of public instruction. It clinched the nail by appropriating $75,000 from the 
income of the State school fand for general State aid until the interest should reach 
the sum of $100,000. The school fund had now reached the sum of $1,550,000. The 
president of the public school seciety proposed that a volume entitled The Pennsyl- 
vania Youths and Freemen’s Book of Duties should be prepared and introduced into 
every school, a suggestion that has recently been adopted in more than one State of 
the Union, and is rapidly coming into popular favor among university men as a depart- 
ment of ‘‘civics” to be added to the curriculum of the American common school. 
Well may the historian declare: ‘Historically, the passage of this bill was the most 
influential event connected with education in Pennsylvania, the first great victory 
for free schools.” In this law the provision for the official management of the 
divisions and districts was essentially the same as at present, as were also the powers 
and duties of school directors in the location of schools, building schoolhouses, 
visiting schools, and making reports. 
But the conflict was not yet at anend. The passage of this beneficent law, like 
an alarm bell, woke to its full capacity for resistance ali the hostile influences in the 
Commonwealth. The statute was permissive, although declaring that only the 
counties voting to impose a local tax should receive the State aid, thus virtually 
putting into the hands of the majority of voters in any community the power to 
deprive it of the benefits of a common-school system. Then, and for years, the 
majority of citizens in most of the counties and districts were averse to the change. 
At first it was fully accepted by only a few districts and gained strength chiefly by 
the offer of State aid. ‘‘Of 987 districts then in the State, 485 either voted altogether 
against free schools or took no action.” The bitterness of the conflict rose to the 
full height of the most exciting political canvass. The northern counties, settled
-P-A-G-E-339

largely by emigrants from New England and New York, generally favored the law, and 
the new portion of the State west of the Alleghanies, the stronghold of the Scotch 
and North Irish people, also received it with gladness. But in the old Pennsylvania, 
the central, southern, and southeastern region, and, greatest of all, in the German 
counties, the opposition was formidable, The causes of this opposition have already 
been clearly set forth. But it should be said in respect to the ecclesiastical opposi- 
tion that it was chiefly from the evangelical Protestant sects, the Catholic and Epis- 
copal churches not yet being sufficiently numerous to represent an effective opposition. 
The Friends, Lutheran, Reform, and Moravian peoples, with few exceptions, voted 
strongly aga the American common school. All these religious bodies for a hun- 
dred and fifty years had been earnestly engaged in building up their own parochial 
systems by the expenditure of money and the assistance and cooperation of similar 
bodies in the old country. It required more than a quarter of a century yet to modify 
these objections of sect and class and bring the whole people of Pennsylvania into 
hearty accord concerning the education of the children. 
Of course this opposition at once took the form of a furious political campaign to 
repeal the obnoxious law. The statute had been passed by an unprecedented major- 
ity, only 4 negative votes in the senate and a solitary individual lifting his voice in 
opposition in the house. But the result of the campaign inaugurated in opposition 
threw into the statehouse in the sessions of 1834-35 a decisive majority of opponents 
in the senate and a doubtful majority of friends in the house. The governor “stood 
to his guns,” although with premonitions of the defeat which came at the ensuing 
election as the ‘“‘reward of merit” so often served out to the public pioneer of a good 
cause. 
But now appeared on the scene another champion of the children. Thaddeus 
Stevens, the son of a poor farmer, was born in 1792, in humble circumstances, in 
Vermont. By severe labor and the sayings of his mother he obtained an education 
in Dartmouth College, and at the age of 23 appeared as a teacher and law student 
in Gettysburg, Pa. In 1831 he was sent to the legislature, labored in favor of an 
educational grant to a local college, and voted for the school law of 1834, though 
with no hand in its construction. He was then and always remained unmarried, 
but, like many another childless man, became a most conspicuous advocate of the 
children’s cause in its hour of peril. 
Tho legislature was flooded with petitions for the repeal of the new school law, 
32,000 people having signed or caused their names to be signed to documents which, 
if rightly described by a committee of examination, were in themselves the most 
_ convincing proof of the necessity of education, more than 10 in every 100 having 
depended on the ability of somebody to write their names, and not 5 in 100 signing 
in English, with a woeful disregard of the minor proprieties of cleanliness and legi- 
bility. The German clergy of the State had been thoroughly aroused, and a very 
formidable element of opposition was the sect of Quakers, But Governor Wolf and 
his successor, Governor Ritner, were of the superior class of Germans, ‘‘solid” for 
schooling, and with refreshing obstinacy stood by the ship and defied the rage of the 
opposition. : 
The senate at once passed an educational bill which partially repealed the law of 
1834 and sent it to the house, where the friends of repeal challenged the school men 
toa “fight to the finish.” It was the sort of conflict where victory comes only as 
the reward of the fearless, positive, and relentless devotion of a leader fully compe- 
tent and afraid of nobody. Such a champion was found in Thaddeus Stevens, who, 
to the amazement of friend and foe, with small outfit of personal popularity, took 
the floor, routed the enemy by a torrent of mingled argument, sarcasm, and denun- 
ciation, and so confirmed the wavering and inspired the faithful that the law of 
1834 was not only sustained, but sent back to the senate revised and improved by a 
majority that compelled acquiescence. 
This and a subsequent speech in 1838 in behalf of the endowment of colleges and

academies placed Mr. Stevens -at the head of the grand army of educators in his 
State during the remainder of his life. These speeches were printed on silk and pre- 
served as precious relics, and a memorial hall commemorates his name in Pennsyl- 
vania College. When that long-waited-for work, Notable Deliverances in Behalf of 
Universal Education, is compiled, this series of legislative orations by Thaddeus 
Stevens will take an honorable place by the side of the most eminent in the educa- 
tional literature of the Republic. 
The date of this great victory was April 11, 1835. Governor Ritner, who owed his 
election to a split in the Democratic party on the educational question, against a 
strong resistance among his own supporters bravely and wisely stoed by the new 
policy and secured the practical working of the law in 1836 by diverting $500,000 of 
the ‘surplus revenue” received by the State from the nation to a fund for building 
schoolhouses to receive the incoming throng of pupils. It was none too early. The 
new statute had forever abolished the odious distinction between the rich and poor 
-and made the public schools not only open to all, but free from every trace of a rate 
bill, a notable advance in which Pennsylvania placed herself twenty years ahead of 
her neighboring State, New York. In thesmoke and tumult of that great battle one- 
half the ancient policy of the State—that the public school is a pauper’s school—dis- 
appeared forever. The yearly State appropriation, exclusive of the schoolhouse 
fund, had leaped from $75,000 to $400,000 in two years, a dollar for each taxable Baits 
itant of the State. 
The governor was fortunate in his secretary of state, the first efficient superintend- 
ent of schools in the Commonwealth, Thomas H. Burrowes. A young man, educated 
in private schools and abroad, he came to his difficult office not only inexperienced, 
but with confused and inadequate ideas on the whole subject of popular education. 
But the practical experience of administration educated him rapidly into one of the 
most efficient of the early superintendents of education in Pennsylvania, although 
his peculiar notions, especially concerning normal school instruction, aided to fasten 
on the State the present system of subsidizing a group of academies for the training 
of common school teachers. Mr. Burrowes held the office for three years, but during 
a long life was a tireless and influential friend of popular education, and in 1862 at a 
critical time was again called to the State superintendency, did excellent service in 
the establishment of soldiers’ orphans’ schools at the close of the civil war, and died 
president of the State agricultural college in 1871. 
In 1837 Superintendent Burrowes reported 742 of the 987 school districts of the 
State as having accepted the law; 3,384 common schools were in operation, with 
8,394 teachers, one-fourth women, and 150,000 children under instruction, with 
monthly salaries of $18.38 for men and $11.96 for women teachers. The schools 
were open four months and three days in the year. Thus in three short years the 
number of pupils had increased nearly fivefold from 32,000, and the office of superin- 
tendent of schools had been put in good working order, with a vigorous adminis- 
tration of educational affairs well under way. 
Here we leave the consideration of the public school system of Pennsylvania for 
the present. It was still a permissive system, not yet really taken to the heart of 
the Commonwealth, still to encounter a long experience of popular indifference and 
opposition. It was not till 1848 that the permissive feature by which the counties 
could reject or refuse to act under the statute was repealed and the system made man- 
datory over the entire Commonwealth. Still, the battle of popular education had 
been fought and won, and after one hundred and fifty years wandering through the 
desert Pennsylvania was well over Jordan, with a good prospect in due time of 
“ conquering a peace” in the glorious promised land. 
But for ten years more the people of Pennsylvania were persuaded to hold on to 
their original policy of leaving the secondary and higher education in the hands of 
private, corporate, and church academies and colleges, chartered and very moder- 
ately subsidized by the State, but with no public authority respecting their organi-
-P-A-G-E-341

zation or the administration of their affairs. Indeed, this statute clung to the 
common school law like the superfluous tail of an antedeluvian animal on its up- 
ward journey by the highway of evolution—a mischievous provision for secondary 
parochial schools. It required an earnest effort to reduce this primal irregular habit 
of State aid to a regular system through five years from 1838, and then to convince 
the most incredulous of the utter fatuity of this British idea in practical operation 
in the United States. 
William Penn brought from England the prevailing idea of a “public school’’—a 
secondary school, generally of the classical type, endowed and sometimes controlled 
by the government. Such was his meaning in his celebrated document, the “Form 
of government,” in which he declared it the duty of the new government and 
eouncil of Pennsylvania ‘to erect and order all public schools.” The Friends’ pub- 
lic school was established by order of Penn, chartered by the new government, and 
put in operation between 1697 and 1711. This was a grammar school with several 
branches in different portions of the city and county, free to those unable to pay 
and from which no boy of sufficient qualification was excluded. In this Penn in- 
tended to establish a system of education for the province, a close reproduction of 
that which sufficed for the schooling of the well-to-do at home. 
In 1749 Dr. Benjamin Franklin and his coadjutors moved on a similar plan by the 
establishment of an academy with branches open to all male pupils and free to the 
poor. In 1755 the academy became a college, and was reorganized as the University 
of Pennsylvania in 1779. It was endowed to the extent of less than $100,000 by the 
Penn family, the provincial government, and an English subscription. At the reor- 
ganization it received a large sum from the confiscated estates of the Pennsylvania 
loyalists. Up to 1832 it was somewhat aided by exemption from taxation and small 
benefactions from the State. These were the only institutions of learning that 
received aid from the government of the province before the war of the Revolution. 
Between 1783 and 1836 fourteen ‘‘ colleges” were established by the State, and all 
but two received a lift from gifts of money or lands. A list of nearly seventy acad- 
emies is given which during the period from 1783 to 1836 were chartered, receiving 
small gifts of money with land. Superintendent Burrowes reported in 1837 that not 
less than $240,000 had been distributed among these academies alone, adding: ‘‘It is 
believed that no gifts have ever been made by the State with less general good effect 
than those to academies.” In 1834 Samuel Breck, the author of the first free school 
bill, reported to the legislature: ‘‘Most of these academies have fallen to the grade 
of common schools.” It was asserted that only 44 or 45 werein existence. ‘‘Mostof 
these have fallen to the grade of the most ordinary common schools, some of them 
are a burlesque upon the name of ‘‘academy,” others have lost their charter, not afew 
* * * have become entirely extinct.” It is difficult to anticipate any’ different 
result from this indiscriminate chartering of local academies in a new country with 
the meager public gift, in most cases insufficient for a single year’s expenses, at best a 
temptation to any ambitious teacher or group of people to undertake the establish 
ment of an institution of learning. 
In 1838 the State legislature supplemented the common school law, revised and 
improved in 1836, by an act intended to systematize this matter of State aid to these 
seminaries of the secondary and higher education. By this law every college or 
academy with 4 professors and 100 students was to receive $1,000 annually for ten 
years, and institutions of lower grade a smaller sum, ranging downward to $300 for an 
academy or other school containing 15 pupils. One advanced feature of this law was 
the first acknowledgment of the State to aid in the education of girls by including 
female seminaries in the State benefactions. Under this law during the five years 
of its existence the State extended aid to 9 “ colleges,” 75 academies, and 40 female 
seminaries, 124 in all, and expended $217,000 in the costly experiment. Atthe close 
of this final effort, after expending from first to last in land and money $1,000,000, 
the failure was so evident that in 1843 the policy came to an end. It was from the

first in flat contradiction to the American idea of the support of education by the 
government, although it had been adopted in New England and continued until a 
late period in a majority of the old States of the Union. 
The attempt to show that it was an early acknowledgment of the duty of the State 
to cducate teachers is of little weight. Of course some of the graduates and students 
from these academies and colleges became teachers as always and everywhere, even 
in a State well supplied with normal school facilities. But the only class of persons 
educated freely in these Pennsylvania schools were the ‘‘ children of the poor,”’ whose 
school life was weighted by the stigma of pauperism with only the destiny of a posi- 
tion as teacher in “‘pauperschools.” This mode of the secondary education was grad- 
ually supplanted by the extension of the free-school age to 20, which enabled the 
public-school system to establish a free high-school department. Later came the 
organization of the present system of normal academies, subsidized and to a degree 
supervised by the State, flanked by a vast system of county institutes for teachers, 
which is regarded by the educators of this State as superior to all others. 
Thus did the State of Pennsylvania respond to the ‘star in the East,” the notable 
revival of the common-school system in New England, under the leadership of 
Horace Mann and Henry Barnard, from 1830 to 1860. While it was somewhat 
inspired by that movement, it was a wave of the great tide of educational reform 
and reorganization that, during the 30 years from 1830 to 1860, swept the entire 
nation to the most distant precinct of the then new West; including a profound 
stirring of the mind and heart of the educational public in the South, as shown by 
numbers of remarkable demonstrations by eminent statesmen and educators and 
public efforts, more or less successful, to establish a state system of education for 
the poorer white people of that section.

CHAPTER VIL 
THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL IN THE SOUTHERN 
STATES DURING THE FIRST HALF CENTURY OF THE 
REPUBLIC, 1790-1840. 
It is still a favorite theory of a class of the representatives of the higher univer- 
sity and college education to proclaim the invariable legitimate descent of the second- 
ary and even elementary schooling of the people always and everywhere from this 
fountain head. In one sense this assertion is ‘‘founded on fact.” All things in 
organized society descend from the fountain head of civilization, among the high- 
lands of personal genius, culture, and character, to the lowlands occupied by the 
masses of mankind. In ages of darkness; in nationalities still brooded over by the 
shadow of barbarism; in European kingdoms and empires, where the superior class 
is secured in the possession of all the great opportunities of life, with the power to 
transmit them to their children; in all lands where the people have not awakened 
to the consciousness of the most imperative need and saered right of man—the need 
and right to the education that shall develop the nature and faculties of each as a 
vital element of the general good; it is true that, not only does the superior minority 
represent this unconscious need and right of the common people, but, as its agent, is 
intrusted by Providence with the duty of organizing the forces and administering 
the institutions and systems of all that bears the name of education. 
But, in proportion as men are relieved from the involved and obstinate bonds by 
which freedom has been suppressed for ages, have the people asserted their funda- 
imental personal right to the educational training that develops their individual and 
social nature and faculties and prepares them for the experience of self-government. 
With the earliest exercise of this right arises the inevitable conflict of the cultivated 
class with the unschooled but aspiring masses. Thus, in every modern European 
nation the higher and professional, even the effective secondary education, strongly 
intrenched in the union of church and state, has resisted the elementary schooling of 
the masses save in such quality and quantity as seemed good to these rulers “by 
divine right.” It has only been after successive periods of civil and religious revo- | 
lution on the continent of Europe that the governments have heeded the clamor of 
the inferior multitude and finally established, in the majority of these countries, a 
national system of popular education. But still the European continental school 
systems, from foundation to summit, are practically in the hands of the government— 
in several of them still implicated with the state church—and represent the well- 
understood advantages and less commendable defects of this form of administration. 
In Great Britain the opposite idea has atlast prevailed. It is only a quarter of acen- 
tury since the old time method of government control of a university system, tied upin 
the bonds of religious exclusiveness, has given place to the present method of sup- 
porting public schools by the subsidizing of all sorts of private and denominational 
institutions for elementary education, on condition of examination by a government 
supervisor supplemented by local school boards to supply a marked deficiency of 
facilities. But here, as always, the fact is apparent that the inauguration and diree- 
tion of popular education proceeds from the university and representatives of the 
267 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
268 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
cultivated class, which cooperate to respect and further a universal instinct gradually 
realized by the masses. As soon as the ‘common people” begin in earnest to assert 
the need and right to education, these same representatives of the higher culture, 
with eminent exceptions, oftener than otherwise are found in combination with a 
watchful state and church, working at cross purposes with the interést of the people. 
- The original settlers of the first American colonies brought from Europe th» 
notions which, as we have seen in our record of education in the provincial and early 
days of the Republic, were the most obstinate and effectual opponents to the estab- 
lishment of the American common school: (1) The view that the church has the sole 
and divine right to educate, or at least must hold in its hand the initiative and admin- 
istration of all education in the form of the elementary parochial, secondary, and 
higher training in the denominational academy and college. (2) The European idea 
that the government must originate a complete system of education under the form 
of a university scheme that includes all departments of learning, subsidized by the 
state. With this idea the leading colleges and universities, from the settlement of 
the country till the middle of the eighteenth century, were established according to 
the theory that they represented education itself, and from them must proceed the 
movement downward to the humble ranks of society. In a similar spirit several of 
the original thirteen colonies attempted an organization which should include all 
schooling of the people under the form of a state university. 
The original Harvard University was regarded as the center and soul of the edu- 
cational system of New England. It was established and for more than a century 
remained largely under the control of the State. The grammar schools were first 
made compulsory institutions as an arrangement to supply the materials of its stu- 
dent population, while the elementary schooling was in a fluctuating condition 
which, even till 1835, left the colleges and academies of Massachusetts still largely 
in possession of the field. Yale, Williams, Brown, and Dartmouth were, fromthe 
first, denominational colleges, neither asking for continuous State support, nor long 
retained in the enjoyment of its educational benefactions. But Columbia, the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania, and William and Mary at first contemplated such a union 
with the government as should make them the head and front of all else in their 
respective spheres. In every case the intent was antagonized and finally defeated 
by the policy of rival sects, which also resisted the growing desire of the people for 
a definite and effective system of popular education. 
With the organization of the National Government the same idea appeared in the 
original establishment in New York of what was called ‘‘The University,” with a 
“hoard of regents,” and the evident intention that this body should be the great 
ministry of the government in its entire relation to education. The same arrange- 
ment was made in Georgia which, to-day, by statute includes every school aided by 
public funds, under the title ‘‘ The University of Georgia.” In practice the Common- 
wealths of Pennsylvania and New Jersey seem to have agreed in the liberal subsi- 
dizing of colleges and academies and neglect of interest in the education of the masses. 
Inevery Southern State t!e State university came first, with a more or less liberal 
subsidizing of academies, with almost total neglect of the public elementary educa- 
tion, till late in the nineteenth century. The most liberal and far-seeing of all these 
schemes is found in Thomas Jefferson’s plan of education, proposed to Virginia on 
becoming a State of the Union; a plan to which its author adhered with pathetic 
obstinacy for half a century, only tosee it fall in a mass of ruins, out of which emerged 
the University of Virginia in 1820. 
Outside a few local efforts in some of the leading cities, up to the period of the 
great cducational revival of 1830-1840, none of the Southern States had anything 
which would be regarded to-day as a proper system of common-school educa- 
tion. This powerful movement for the education of the children of all the people 
gradually extended through the Northern States until, by 1850, all of them had 
laid the foundation of their present system of popular education. This movement 
was also felt, especially among the foremost educators, statesmen, and progressive
-P-A-G-E-345
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 269 
people in all the Southern States, and led to very interesting and more or less suc-_ 
cessful efforts to establish a system of elementary instruction for the poorer classes 
of the white people. Hence the story of the American common-school in the South- 
ern States before 1830-1840 is soon told and, possibly, would be better treated in 
connection with the movement led by Horace Mann and his associates in 1830-1840, 
and extending to the present year. 
Still, it would be doing great injustice to the masses of the people of our Southern 
States, especially to the record of their great educators, statesmen, and progressive 
class, to drop these links of the historical chain. For in all these communities the 
one determined impulse toward universal education is apparent among large numbers 
even of the humbler sort of the white people. Although the educational movement 
among the superior classes still held fast by the old European form of the denomina- 
tional college and academy, there was from the beginning an attempt among the 
people to educate their children. 
The history of the higher education in the most prominent of these Common- 
wealths has been told in a series of ‘Circulars of Information,” published by the 
National Bureau of Education, in a way that need not in any detail be repeated. 
But still, the universities, colleges, and academies of these States, up to a period 
later than 1830-1840, virtually represented the organized educational life of these 
States, and in a degree attempted to meet the rising demand for the American com- 
mon school. It will therefore be necessary to make a passing record of their opera- 
tions during this half century, with an eye especially to their bearing on the ‘‘origin 
of the American common school,” which is the theme of this essay. Here, as else- 
where, Virginia set the keynote, and in abrief record of the great conflict in behalf of 
the ‘‘holy cause” of general education, never absent from the mind and heart of Jeffer- 
son and his educational colleagues for half a century, shall we find our best guide to a 
fatr judgment of the early educational work of all the original States in this section 
of the country. 
    VIRGINIA. 
We have already recorded the progress of education in Virginia, from the origin 
of the colony in 1608 to the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1776. In this 
period of nearly one hundred and seventy years we find nothing to remind us even 
of the beginnings of the American common schools, save, perhaps, the action of 
neighbors in the support of a ‘field school,” or neighborhood arrangement, tem- 
porary in its character, but the outgrowth of a popular desire for the schooling of 
the children. At the opposite end of society we have traced the history of William 
and Mary College through the days of its greatest influence to the edge of its period 
of declension, accelerated by the removal of the capital from Williamsburg to 
Richmond. William and Mary was in more than one respect a government college, 
according to the pattern of the English universities. It was the creature of the 
home government, named from the two great sovereigns of the new régime, repre- 
sented by a member in the provincial legislature, partly supported by public funds, 
a vital part of the established church of Virginia, situated at the focus of the 
civic, social, and ecclesiastical life of the colony. Until the breaking out of the 
war of independence, it commanded the entire approbation of the foremost society 
of the province and educated such of the promising young men as were not sent 
abroad or to the Northern colleges. But, with these advantages, it was, from the 
first, a fit representative of the old-time high aristocratic side of Virginia, and did 
not attract students from a rising and most important class of the population. 
The first educational protest against this policy came from the Presbyterian emi- 
gration to the State, about the middle of the eighteenth century, As early as 1738 
the Synod of Philadelphia had petitioned Governor Gooch, himself a Scotchman, in 
behalf of the religious toleration of the Presbyterian people, then emigrating to 
Virginia. A favorable response was followed by that remarkable movement of the
-P-A-G-E-346
  270 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Scotch, North-Ivish, and German Protestant people that gave a sort of backbone to 
the original colony of the old Atlantic South. An carly result was the establishment 
of an academy in Prince Edward County in 1776, under the rectorship of Rev. Sam- 
uel Stanhope Smith, an eminent missionary of this faith, a native of Pennsylvania 
and a graduate of the College of New Jersey. In 1777 the name of the academy was 
changed to Hampden-Sydney, compounded of the names of the two great English 
representatives of civil liberty. The academy developed to the college of that name, 
which still remains an honored and moderately prosperous college of the conventional 
type. Until later days, always stinted for the means of support, this institution has 
graduated many influential men, and numbers of the most successful college men of 
the South haye been connected with its faculty. It established the first theological 
and model medical school of the State, both of which are still in existence. But its 
most notable reputation for our purpose is that it was the first declaration of inde- 
pendence from the educational idea of a church and state college under which 
Virginia had lived until well into the second century of her history." Its higher 
educational department dates from the administration of President J. P. Cushing, 
elected to the presidency in 1821. President Cushing was a native of New Hampshire 
and a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy. During his administration of fourteen 
years a proper faculty was organized and the basis of collegiate education laid. 
But while the Presbyterian Church was in the American colonies, as abroad, a 
staunch representative of liberty in civic affairs and religious freedom, as far as 
the emancipation of the polity of the church from the rule of Rome and the great 
British State establishment was concerned, being the first organization of the Chris- 
tian religion in modern days in which the Christian people appear as the foundation 
of ecclesiastical power, its ecclesiasticism was still a bar to a further expansion of 
the colonial educational mind. Almost contemporaneous in point of time came the 
movement by which a Presbyterian academy at Lexington, Va., in the Shenanddah 
Valley, was dedicated as ‘Liberty Hall,” in 1782 receiving the first charter of an 
educational institution made by the new Commonwealth of Virginia. In 1796 
George Washington proposed to devote to an institution of learning the 100 shares 
of stock of the James River Company presented him by his native State. Liberty 
Hall was selected as the recipient of the bounty and its name changed to Washing- 
ton Academy. By aid of this donation, now represented by a fund of $50,000, and 
“another from the bequest of the Association of the Cincinnati of Virginia, amounting 
to $23,000, and a third of $40,000 {rom the estate of John Robinson, the academy blos- 
somed into Washington College, and, as a vigorous and well-supported institution, 
went on 1ts way till the close of the civil war, when it was baptized anew into the name 
“Washington and Lee,” under the presidency of the most distinguished commander 
of the Confederate armies. While this college never contributed to the cause of 
popular education, yet through its president, Dr. Henry Ruffner, it made a most 
remarkable protest against the institution of slavery that defied the unanimity of 
sentiment that prevailed before the civil war. His son, Dr. William H. Ruffner, was 
the first State superintendent of education of Virginia, ‘sh the most notable South- 
     
ern educator of late enlisted in the cause of the people’s school, the Horace Mann of 
the South. | 
A generation later, in 1829-30, the growing Methodist Sere of the South 
established the largest institution of the higher education in another part of the State, 
in Randolph-Macon College. First set up in Mecklenburg County, on the borders of 
North Carolina, it took to itself the names of the two Representatives in Congress 
from the adjoining districts, Randolph and Macon. Aé the close of the civil war, the 
college was removed to Ashland, near Richmond, where it now flourishes, one of the 
most noted and useful of all the great schools of the State. From the first this cols, 
lege has been characterized by a certain progressive Smut and broad catholicity of 
administration. As carly as 1839, long before such a movemens was entertained by 
the older colleges of the nation, it established a department of English under the 
charge of Prof. E. D. Sims, and to the present day has been known as a persistent
-P-A-G-E-347
  EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 271 
representative of that important study. In 1839 it combined with this another new 
departure in a resolution by its trustees, ‘That, as soon as practicable, the trustees 
of Randolph-Macon College will establish a normal school, as a department in the 
college, in which a good and liberal English education can be obtained and which, 
in its organization, shall be especially fitted to educate common-school teachers, and 
that the professor of English literature shall be the rector thereof.” The rapidly 
increasing Methodist body thus, at.a period of thirty years before the establishment ; 
of the present system of common schools in Virginia, recognized the importance of 
lifting the inefficient and unpopular ‘‘free school” of the Old Dominion into respect- 
ability through the influence of superior teaching. The elective system of studies 
was also established on the removal of the college in 1868. It is not remarkable 
that in an educational atmosphere so genial, a group of the most progressive and 
distinguished of the college men of the South has been found in Professor Price, now 
of Columbia College, New York; Dr. Deems, late of the Church of the Strangers, 
New York; Professor Lupton, Chancellor Garland, Bishop McTyeire, and Professor 
Baskerville, of Vanderbilt University ; Superintendent Peay, of Richmond; Profes- 
sor Woodward, of South Carolina College; Professor Sharpe, of Tulane; Professor 
Edwards, now of Michigan Agricultural College, and others, ineluding its present 
able and cnergetie president, Dr. W. W. Smith. 
Emory and Henry College, planted in an ideal situation in southwest. Virginia in 
1833-34 by the untiring zeal of Rey. Creed Fulton, enjoyed an honorable and pros- 
perous career until the civil war. It still needs only the good will of faithful friends 
to make it ono of the most valuable of the higher schools of the great mining, 
manufacturing, and agricultural realm of southwest Virginia, which is not excelled 
by any portion of the United States in its resources and capable, by fair treatment, 
of becoming itself a prosperous State. 
“Emory and Henry shares this opportunity with Roanoke College, established by 
the Lutheran body before the civil war, now in a steady course of development. It 
now shares with the reorganized William and Mary the peculiar merit of sustaining 
a professor of pedagogy and a historian of education in Dr. Painter. 
One of the most prosperous and useful institutions of learning now in Virginia, 
Richmond College, owes its existence to a movement in 1830 by the Virginia Baptist 
Edueation Society, ‘to devise and propose some plan for the improvement of young 
men who, in the judgment of the churches, are called to the work of the ministry.” 
The result of this effort for two years was the placing of thirteen young men in 
private schools. But in 1832 the society bought a tract of land 4 miles from Rich- 
mond and opened a manual-labor sehool, called ‘‘ Virginia Baptist Seminary.” Two 
prominent clergymen of the denomination, Drs. Ryland and Ball, instructed twenty- 
six students in the elements of an English and classical education; the majority 
with a view to the Christian ministry. In 1833 the institution was removed to its 
present site, now in the corporation of Richmond. Land was acquired with a view 
of extending the manual-labor feature, but this impracticable device for ‘working 
ont an education” failed here, as everywhere, and was abandoned in 1841. 
From this humble beginning this institution wrought steadily and honestly at the 
problem of building up a genuine college until 1850, when it may be said to have 
been fairly established on its present foundation. Although greatly disturbed by 
the civil war, it was thoroughly reorganized and liberally endowed on the return of 
peace and is now one of the most reliable of the denominational colleges of the 
State. Besides the extended reputation of its early faculty in chureh circles, Rich- 
mond College has given to the larger educational movement since 1865 two men of 
national distinction—President Charles L. Cocke, for many years and still at the 
head of Hollins Institute, one of the best known and most substantial institutions 
in the South for the superior iustruction of girls, and Dr. J.L.M. Curry, for a time 
professor and now president of the college board of trustees, at present best known 
of all educators in the Southern States as general agent of the George Peabody 
educational fund and of the Slater fund for the industrial and normal training of

colored youth. The history of the gradual growth of Richmond College to its 
present honorable position, is in one important respect characteristic and worthy of 
imitation, namely, the honest and persistent intention of its management from the 
first to avoid exaggeration, work within its means, and make no professions it 
was not prepared to verify. 
All but four of these collegiate schools of Virginia were established previous to 
1830-1840, Itis asignal triumph of the common-school idea that the ancient college 
of William and Mary, finally rejected by Jefferson for obstinate opposition to his 
scheme of education a hundred years ago, is now in its reorganization practically a 
State normal school for young men, with a larger attendance than in the best days 
of its old renown. 
All these institutions, established before the period now considered, doubtless con- 
tributed to keep alive the desire for an effective system of popular education; each 
in its own way, sometimes despite of itself, being made to work toward the coming 
policy of the New Dominion, the system of common schools for both races and all 
classes established in 1870. But the University of Virginia, by its very origin, was 
more closely identified with the original conception of popular education. The 
details of the establishment and subsequent history of this, for half a century the 
leading Southern university, are so thoroughly given in the admirable “ Circular of 
Information” by Prof. Herbert B. Adams, of Johns Hopkins University, ‘Thomas 
Jefferson and the University of Virginia,” including its relations to the general educa- 
tion of the State, that we content ourselves with a reference to this work and a 
passing notice. ‘ 
We have already told the deeply interesting story of the original conception of a 
system of education for the whole people of Virginia, including the emancipation 
and schooling of the colored folk, as outlined in Jefferson’s “‘ Notes on Virginia,” and 
brought forward at the organization of the Commonwealth in 1776. Also, the 
practical failure of the popular side of the scheme in 1796, through that most 
ingenious method of ‘‘ heading off” a plan of universal education, a permissive law, 
placing the initiative of every public school of the State in the hands of the county 
magistrates, the men of all others who would “have none of it.” From that date, 
possibly owing to the preoccupation of Jefferson in national affairs, the movement 
was delayed until 1810, when the literary fund was established from “certain 
endowments, penalties, and forfeitures, to the encouragement of learning.” Five 
years later this was made a substantial reality by the addition of the large sum due 
from the United States to the Commonwealth. 
During all these years, an entire generation from the time when the great project 
of Jefferson was broached, despite the persistent agitation by the great statesman 
and his most influential friends, Washington, Madison, Monroe, Marshall, and Cabell, 
the State had hung back from any practical scheme of popular education, even for 
the majority of the white population. . Baffled at every step in the project nearest 
his heart, the mind and will of Jefferson more and more centered on the only practi- 
cable part of his large plan, the establishment of a university on the broadest 
foundations, combining the most advanced ideas for a great training school of the 
new American civilization, that would become in time the proper head of the educa- 
tional scheme of the State. Jefferson’s extended correspondence with the most 
eminent educators of Europe and America during these forty years, if collected and 
properly edited with fit historical and biographical environment, would be a most 
valuable treatise for the use especially of the educational public of the South. 
In 1816, the literary fund having grown to the sum of $1,000,000, the board of direct- 
ors, a sort of extemporized State board of education, of which Governor Nicholas 
was president, was invited by the legislature to report ‘‘a system of public education, 
including a university, to be called the University of Virginia, and such additional 
colleges, academies, and schools as should diffuse the benefits of education through 
the Commonwealth.” From this sprung up a vigorous correspondence, in which 
large numbers of celebrated educators at home and abroad were called to give their
-P-A-G-E-349
  EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. + 24S 
opinions in regard to an ideal school. As usual, each ‘great educator” addressed 
presented his own ideal, probably not then realized upon earth, and altogether a 
mass of very interesting educational literature was placed before the board of direct- 
ors. But Virginia was not yet to be the leader of the educational column. It was 
no part of the policy of any class, or of any save a select body of the most eminent 
statesmen and educators of the State, to open the gates of knowledge even to the 
masses of their own race. The disappointing outcome of the prayers, toil, and sacri- 
fice of forty years was the law of 1818, appropriating the sum of $45,000, accruing from 
the income of the literary fund for the schooling of ‘poor children,” under the direc- 
tion of commissioners of the local courts of each county. These children were to be 
selected and, with the consent of their parents or guardians, sent to a competent school 
to be taught the elements of knowledge; supplies were to be paid for out of the 
moneys appropriated to the school. Along with this went an appropriation of 
$15,000 for the support of ‘‘The University of Virginia.” 
On this perilous edge of failure did Jefferson and his friends rally for the upbuild- 
ing of the university. A favorable commission of location chose Albemarle County. 
A generous donation of land on an ideal site fixed the destiny of the school. A series 
of loans amounting to $180,000 from the literary fund, afterwards remitted by the 
legislature, placed in the hands of the executive committee the means of putting on 
the ground the most unique and probably the most attractive group of university 
buildings then in the Union. Professors from abroad, including the famous Professor 
Cooper, son-in-law of Dr. Joseph Priestley, then living in Pennsylvania, himself 
deeply interested in education, though under the ban of belief in an advanced 
religious creed, were brought to the new foundation. Jefferson, the head and front 
of the enterprise, proposed with great enthusiasm a scheme of university education, 
at that time undoubtedly the broadest and most practical in the country, which, as 
far as possible, was adopted by the management. From the imposing height of 
Monticello the old statesman through his telescope watched the growth of the school, 
practically directed the organization, and till the day of his death, in 1826, was its 
real president. 
Without doubt the organization of a university on a plan so progressive, especially 
its freedom from sectarian control, though with steadfast adherence to the funda- 
mental faiths of religion and morality, 1ts elective/system of study, its broad and 
benevolent scheme of discipline, its appeal to the pride of a Commonwealth, with 
only one political rival in the growing power of New York, was a pledge given by 
Virginia to the coming generation that in due time the education of the masses of 
her people should be equally considered. But it was also inevitable that, after the 
death of Jefferson, the university should naturally pass under the control of the 
dominant influence of the class which was committed to the policy then uppermost 
in favor. Jefferson could not fail to realize with what a pittance the State was put- 
ting off the majority of her children in the apology for universal education offered 
by the ‘‘ poor school,” treated with undisguised contempt by ‘‘the poor” to whom it 
was offered even to the opening of the civil war. Of course, with the colleges and 
numerous academies, fifty in number, that grew up in all parts of the State, includ- 
ing several valuable female seminaries, and the persistent habit of the wealthy people 
of schooling its children in the North and abroad, the leading favored class built 
itself up to a condition of power and national consideration always possible under 
such conditions. The University of Virginia in time became the most prominent 
institution of the higher education in all the South and one of the most character- 
istic and influential seats of learning in the Union through the years before the civil 
war. This is not the place to discuss or even describe the sources of its greatness 
or its peculiar influence on the rise and development of the educational spirit of the 
section, all of which will be found so ably and even affectionately set forth in the 
documents of the National Bureau of Education already referred to. 
Jefferson died in deep disappointment because of the virtual failure of his grand 
scheme for the education of the people of his beloved Commonwealth. The words  
-P-A-G-E-350
274 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
in which he published his sorrows, in his declining years, are among the most power- 
ful and prophetic in the educational literature of the Republic. But their fulfillment 
can be traced in the illiteracy that so widely prevailed up toa late date in this proud 
old Commonwealth, especially through the interesting country beyond the mountains, 
including the present State of West Virginia and the southwestern section of the 
Old Dominion. The period now under consideration was not the day of educational 
statistics, and only by side glimpses and incidental revelations can it be understood 
how deeply the State of Jefferson suffered for its long delay in accepting his gospel 
of the true democracy—the education of the whole people for republican citizenship. 
In 1820 alterations in the permissive laws were made by which the benefits of free 
primary schooling were extended to all classes of white children. The county could 
be laid off into districts of 6 miles square. As soon as the people of one of these 
districts had raised three-fifths of the sum to build a schoolhouse the remaining two- 
fifths might be appropriated from the State literary fund, provided it did not exceed 
one-tenth the sum due the district from the State. There was the attempt to frame 
something resembling a general system of common schools; but with the small sum 
of $45,000 for a State which in 1831 contained 700,000 white people and not less than 
100,000 children and youth of proper school age, and, with the extreme improba- 
bility that the counties most in need of education would act, or the schools thus 
established would be worth attending, there was very remote prospect of any con- 
siderable result. In fact, in 1840 the number of children in the State in attendance 
on the State schools was only 27,598, one-fifth of all the children between 8 and 15 
years of age. The other four-fifths were being educated by the more popular neigh- 
borhood field, private, and denominational methods, or not schooled at all. 
A picturesque description of one of the better sortof the numerous Virginia ‘field 
schools” of the old time would givea hint that a good deal was going on in this region 
of educational enterprise and even during these years was germinating the seeds of 
a great revival of education. It will be a grateful task to record how, during the 
period 1840-1860, an increasing body of the most eminent men of Virginia called the 
attention of the people to the imperious educational needs of the time in a way, not 
only powerful and patriotic, but prophetic of what was in store in a still far off 
future, when, rising from the awful wreck of war, this grand old Commonwealth, 
dismembered of a noble estate, should turn at last to the counsels of its great educa- 
tional statesman in the establishment of the complete American system of common 
schools for all her people, realizing the idea of Jefferson in 2 way more in harmony 
with the ideals of the present age. And when, in the sunimer of 1879, the University 
of Virginia opened her doors to the first State institute of teachers, it required no 
poetic imagination to fancy the marble statue of the illustrious apostle of freedom 
and education extending his hand in benediction, recalling the prediction that he 
and his aged friend, John Adams, from their abode in Heaven, should look down 
with rapture on what both had so long desired but had “‘ died without the sight.” 
MARYLAND. 
Whatever credit may be accorded to the original government of the province of 
Maryland for the assertion and maintenance of religious liberty under the adminis- 
tration of Lord Baltimore, there is no evidence that, during the long half century 
from 1634 to 1689, the government had done anything noteworthy for education. The 
only attempt to found a school under governmental auspices, in 1671, failed and was 
neyer revived. The failure was doubtless more the result of the semifeudal and 
jntensely aristocratic structure of society than from the lack of zeal in a priesthood 
alwaysready to fortify their church, at least by an establishment of the higher edu- 
cation. It has been well stated that the original Massachusetts law, compelling 
every neighborhood of fifty families to establish a school, would have been of impos- 
Sible enforcement in Maryland from the fact that nowhere, outside a few hamlets, 
were there as many households within sufficient distance of each other for such asso- 
ciation.

EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 275 
Originally a part of the vast territory of Virginia, the one early attempt in Mary- 
Jand to found a school of the higher education was swallowed up by the new enter- 
prise that placed on the soil of the Old Dominion tho college of William and Mary. 
But tho wealthy and ruling families of the new colony dutifully sent back their sons 
to England or France for education, according to their religious connections, and the 
children that were educated at home depended on family instruction or such ‘aid 
and comfort” as might be obtained from the very questionable class of tramping 
schoolmasters; some of them drawn from the crowd of indentured servants ; toomany 
of them of personal ill repute. 
The overthrow of the Lord Baltimore régime and the substitution of a Protestant 
policy at the beginning of the eighteenth century mark the first departure of the 
government in behalf of education. But until the year 1865 the people of Maryland, 
outside one or two localities, were educationally in the hands of a class of leaders 
who seem never to have broadly apprehended the significance of the American com- 
mon school. From an early day, a full century before the organization of the National 
Government, there was a growing, often a vigorous desire, for something that would 
offer the “‘great American chance” to the children who were being trained to face 
the tremendous crisis of the conflict for national independence, 
But the triple-headed rock on which every movement successively foundered was: 
(1) The establishment of a system of county academies of the old English free-school 
pattern, subsidized by the State. These schools were really of the secondary classical 
type, though proposing to deal with the elementary training of children for their 
own preparatory work, But these wero not supported from below by any general 
system of elementary schooling and, after a few abortive attempts to found a college 
or university, had no outlook above. The majority of them were managed by a close 
corporation after its first appointment by the government, shut out from all public 
or private interference. They were all tied to the Church of England, and honored 
the Archbishop of Canterbury as'their head. In all but the small subsidizing by the 
colonial government they were in no sense public schools according to the American 
idea. 
(2) This very organization was the cause of the pecuniary failure into which they 
all sunk at last, as into a common pit-of impecuniosity. There was no public sense 
of obligation to support them by a tolerable dispensation of State aid. The school 
revenue was obtained by a system of taxation on the most important production of 
the colony, with all the vices and none of the virtues of a tariff levied for revenue 
or protection. Thus, with no provision for what was most needed—a system of ele- 
mentary education—the mass of the people during the entire colonial period seem to 
haye been chiefly interested, first, in a successful attempt to destroy the colleges in 
behalf of the academies in which they had somewhat of an interest, and later the 
unsuccessful effort to divert the small annuity from these to the elementary schools. 
Instead of being instructed according to the American common-school way—eyen 
then in full operation in New England—of putting their hands in their pockets for 
the public education of the children, these people were divided over the appropria- 
tion of a meager pittance doled out from funds not collected by taxation, now to 
this and now to that style of educational arrangement. Asa result of the lack of: 
the higher education there was no body of competent teachers to make the academies 
what they should be. It was estimated that in thirty years a sum of money had 
been sent to the city of Philadelphia alone, for the annual superior training of one 
“hundred boys, amounting to $500,000, which, added to the large expense of the 
higher schooling abroad, would with proper economy have made a solid foundation 
for 2 common-school system for the whole people. 
(3) Even more fatal was the common blunder of this group of Southwestern Middle 
States—New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware—of confining the pub- 
lic money spent for education to the support of the children of the poor. Under 
the colonial life, not yet emancipated from European ideas, this expedient was 
neyer grateful to the recipients, and fixed the stigma of ‘pauper school” on the 
     
-P-A-G-E-352
  276 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
whole arrangement. But after the beginning of the national life it was always and 
everywhere an invidious and hateful method, entailing inevitable failure on every 
school entangled with it. 
Complicated as it was in Maryland, even in the somewhat advanced law of 1825, 
with the permissive clause which enabled any community to refuse to adopt the 
system, the fate of public education from the first was doomed to the judgment pro- 
nounced by Governor Lyon in 1855. After more than two hundred years of effort as 
colony and Commonwealth to educate her people, it was declared by the chief execu- 
tive magistrate of the State that ‘our school system, except in Baltimore, isin a 
state of most utter and hopeless prostration. Our plan of public instruction must 
be reconstructed anew; made uniform in its operations through the State; supported 
more liberally by State and county revenues, and, above all, it should be subject 
to some controlling and primary power, through which all operations should be 
annually collected and made publie, or it will fail to meet the exigency of our con- 
dition or be attended with any public benefit.” 
Our review of the pre-Revolutionary educational history of Maryland has suffi- 
ciently illustrated this general statement of the causes of failure of the public-school 
effort, while it has accounted for the wealth of culture and patriotic character developed 
by the first great effort for national life. The history of the higher education has 
already been told in a ‘circular of information,” from the National Bureau of Edu- 
cation. It only remains to briefly indicate the successive attempts of the legisla- 
ture to respond to the growing demand of the people of Maryland during the first 
fifty years of the Republic for the educational opportunities that never came, save as 
asequel to the great war of emancipation from the most formidable obstacle to the 
American common school, the institution of negro slavery. This institution had 
lingered in Maryland for fifty years previous only as a burden on the progress of 
that Commonwealth so favored by nature, and to-day becoming one of the com- 
manding educational centers of the Union. 
In 1790 the population of Maryland was 300,000. The only public provision for 
education was the establishment of the “ free school” or academy, already described, 
in a majority of the counties of the State. Of the fifteen foundations of this sort 
seven were afterwards consolidated with institutions of the secondary grade, four 
were abolished, one became an elementary school, and two were utilized for the support 
of the poor. The cotistitution of 1776 contained no provision for education. In 1805 
the support of the State was withdrawn from colleges, and the nominal ‘ University 
of Maryland,” composed of Washington and St. John’s colleges, collapsed. The funds 
thus diverted from the higher education were now concentrated, for a quarter of a 
century, upon the attempt to develop the academic system of the separate counties. 
Several new academies were chartered, some of which succeeded and are flourishing 
institutions at the present day. In 1802 a medical school was established in Balti- 
more, which in 1807 was chartered as The Medical College of Maryland, with per- 
mission to work a $40,000 lottery for its support. In 1812 this school put forth the 
departments of divinity, letters, and arts, and assumed the title of University of 
Maryland, but the only result was the securing of good medical and literary schools. 
At a later date, in 1825, the Maryland Institute of Mechanic Arts was chartered at 
Baltimore, with provision for fifty free scholarships. The foundation has become one of 
the real schools of the State; has instructed 17,000 students, and to-day is probably in 
its highest condition of usefulness. During all this half century the legislature was 
busy with the chartering of many private and denominational schools, with statutes 
in behalf of education in separate communities, probably all of more or less value; 
but nothing in the direction of the establishment of a practical working system of 
common schools. The disestablishment of the Episcopal Church at the organization 
of the State government in 1776 sent forth more than fifty clergymen of this faith, 
only seven of whom returned to England, many of them becoming teachers, to the 
advantage of that fraternity. The chronic plague of the vagrant schoolmaster seems
-P-A-G-E-353
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 277 
to have been severely felt in Maryland even toa late day. Many of these people 
were little better than tramps—drunkards, ignorant; in all ways contemptible as 
teachers of children. The lack of fit home instruction sent multitudes of the superior 
students to the neighboring States of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, even farther 
north, for university opportunities. . 
Up to the year 1812 ‘‘the elementary education was still a matter of private con- 
cern, except as the academies performed the office of primary schooling.” Each of 
the fifteen chartered academies was governed by a close corporation of trustees. In 
1814 the fortunes of persons dying intestate were appropriated for the schools of 
Baltimore, and provisions for the schooling of needy orphans at public expense were 
made by law. 
In 1812 the first important essay at public aid for primary education was made by 
a tax on bank stock and some other sources of revenue. In 1816, $50,000 a year was 
voted for five years’ instruction of the poor, the funds to be raised by a lottery. 
In 1821 another attempt was made to move the National Government to a plain act 
of justice by including the original thirteen States in the gift of Western Iands for 
universal education. Maryland especially would seem to have had a claim to this 
distribution, as it was the action of her Representatives in the Congress of the Con- 
federation that set in motion the scheme for the magnificent land grant to all of the 
new States admitted to the Union. An elaborate report was made and resolutions 
passed, which were sent to all the States, with no important result. In 1823 it was 
enacted that every academy should educate free one pupil for every $100 received 
from the State. 
In 1825 the popular demand had become so urgent that a decided new departure 
was inaugurated. Mr. Littleton Dennis Teackle was appointed chairman of a legis- 
lative committee to report a system of common-school instruction for the white chil- 
dren of the Commonwealth. After due investigation, the committee came under the 
influence of the Lancasterian system of instruction by monitors which at this time 
was in full operation in New York and Philadelphia and largely dominated the official 
mind of the country. An elaborate plan was offered and adopted. Buta great merit 
seemed to be found in the fact that, by this system, where 300 to 500 children would 
be under the supervision of one master on a salary of $300 per annum, the entire white 
youth of the State could be educated for 62 cents per head. The system included: 
(1) A State superintendency of education; (2) the appointment of nine commission- 
ers in each county by the governor and council; (3) ‘‘suitable” trustees, elected 
for each school district into which the county had been divided by the commissioners, 
and eighteen discreet persons, also appointed by the commissioners, to form with 
them a body of school inspectors. The commissioners were to divide the county into 
districts, examine and approve teachers, distribute the public money, and exercise a - 
general supervision over the working of the system. The public money was to be 
paid only for the support of teachers. 
But this remarkable law bore in its own vitals the fatal disease of ‘local option;” 
for it was only permissive, the public funds being dispensed on a poll of the legal 
voters. It never went into full operation in any county; thirteen only adopted 
and six rejected it. In 1828 the governor reported the law a practical failure. The 
State superintendency, held by Mr. Teackle, was abolished, not to be resumed till 
1856. The accomplished author of Education in Maryland ascribes the failure to 
the lack of training in local affairs by the people and indifference and opposition 
to public taxation for public education. 
Yet the educational policy of the State since the year of its settlement had been 
working toward the schooling of all the children. The city of Baltimore, by this 
law, was empowered to organize a system of public schools, through the appoint- 
ment of commissioners by the city government. In 1825 commissioners were ap- 
pointed who projected a system of elementary education to be put on the ground 
after five years. In 1828 it was ordered that six elementary schools for boys and six
-P-A-G-E-354
  Dee EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
for girls should be established. But the funds were not forthcoming, and, in 1829, 
two schools for males and one for females were opened, on the Lancasterian plan, 
with one paid teacher for 300 children. The system slowly made head, and it was 
not till ten years later, 1839, on the establishment of the boys’ high school (now 
Baltimore City College) and two of similar grade for girls, that the system found 
itself with a head and entered upon that career of snecess which has brought the 
city of Baltimore abreast with the other metropolitan centers of public education. 
Baltimore now enjoys a generous system of education, public and endowed, in its 
common schools, in the State Normal College, the Johns Hopkins University, and 
the Peabody Institute, with several foundations of wide reputation for the superior 
education of girls, industrial and art training, and charitable institutions of the 
educational type, crowned by the admirable free library, the gift of Mr. Enoch Pratt. 
With the inauguration of the elementary school system of 1825 there broke out a 
war upon the chartered academies of the State, with the view of transferring the 
funds dedicated to them to the new common schools. But this made no sensible 
impression on the policy of the State in this respect. Meanwhile, the public-school 
fund had grown from taxes of various descriptions and through a considerable sam 
from tho national ‘‘surplus revenue” donated to all the States in 1836. 
In 1840 there were in Maryland 12 ‘‘ colleges,” with 813 students; 133 academies and 
grammar schools, with 4,289 pupils; 565 primary schools, with 16,851 scholars, 6,624 
of whom were receiving public aid. The number of white adult illiterates in the 
Commonwealth was reported as 11,891. 
This record of public education in Maryland is relieved, as in all the Southern 
States, by eminent examples of the efforts of educational reformers and the gradual 
growth of a popular demand for better things. But, until 1865, at the close of the 
civil war, nothing essentially different was attempted. 
DELAWARE. 
Although, in population among the least, and next to the least in size of the forty- 
four States, Delaware, in her educational history, presents an impressive object 
lesson on the efforts of her people to overcome the vexatious obstacles to the union 
of the divers nationalities, sects, and conditions of people of which her population 
has been made up. Delaware was figst settled and governed by the Swedes and 
Finns, from 1638 to 1655. It was then a Dutch colonial appendage to New York for 
nine years. In 1664 it passed under English rule. In 1682 the Duke of York ceded 
to William Penn the two lower counties of Delaware. After an unsuccessful attempt 
at independence, in 1691, the territory was finally separated from Pennsylvania in 
1702, though still under the nominal governorship of Pennsylvania until the close 
of the Revolutionary war. Asif worried to the last point of public endurance by 
this game of political battledoor and shuttlecock, Delaware fled to the national 
cover, becoming the first State that gave its assent to the Union in 1787. 
The story of the efforts of this original colony of Swedes to perpetuate themselves 
as a Swedish people in a néw country, their obstinate attachment to their own lan- 
guage and the old-country method of combining the church and school during the 
one hundred and fifty years before this little community of at best 1,200 people was 
finally merged in the rising tide of British life, might well be published as an 
instructive lesson to some of our recent European immigrants who incline to the same 
exclusive policy. Enough to say, that while it is probable these people, chiefly of 
the humbler sort, were after a fashion able to keep up the home custom of reading 
their own language, it was fifty years before a school got on its legs and as long 
before a gift of books came from the Swedish Government with schoolmasters to 
teach the children to read them, That a people descended from a population so 
generally intelligent and well-instructed as the Swedes of three centuries ago should 
have thus struggled for one hundred and fifty years against the prevailing tendency 
of the new American life, only at last to be swallowed up beyond future recognition,

is one cf the convincing proofs of the absurdity of seeking to perpetuate on Ameri- 
can soil any state of society antagonistic to republican ideas and the inevitable 
abolition of European distinctions in the national character. 
Even less satisfactory is the record of the brief period of the Dutch oceupation of 
Delaware asa distant suburb of Manhattan Island from 1655 to the conquest of New 
York by the English in 1664. Despite the vigorous effort to deprive New England 
of her well-earned reputation as the mother of the American common school, there 
was little in the original efforts of the Dutch colony, either in New York or the adja- 
cent States, to reveal anything beyond the ordinary parochial school of the day; 
even at that a feeble imitation of what was a vigorous system over the sea. The 
Dutch in Delaware scem to have been even less fortunate in securing educational 
facilities for their children than their brethren in New York, and the little that was 
‘achieved was lost in the opening years of the Revolutionary epoch. 
We have already, in the early history of education in Pennsylvania, given the 
record of the Society of Friends. in regard to universal education. Even the exclu- 
sive-sectarian type of their schools seems not to have benefited the province of Del- 
aware while it was a portion of the vast domain of William Penn. Not until 1784 
was a denominational school established in Wilmington, Del., by this people, who 
probably were not in great force in this province. In the possession of a printing 
press Delaware and Georgia were the least favored of the American colonies, for not 
until 1761 did a printer take up his abode in Delaware, and but one newspaper was 
started before the Revolution. 
Beyond the passing of several acts confirming grants for schools in connection with 
churches, etc., there was no early attempt at State aid for education in Delaware. 
The first constitution of tho State, in 1792, contained no reference to education. The 
revised constitution in 1831 directs the legislature ‘to provide by law for the estab- 
lishment of schools and promoting arts and sciences.” 
By successive laws of 1796-97 and 1806, the latter law enacted to continue in force 
till 1820, an attempt was made to establish a State school fund from various licenses. 
This, with such bequests and gifts as might come from individuals, was to be invested 
in bank stocks in Delaware and Pennsylvania, with a provision that none of it should 
be appropriated for the secondary or higher education. A subsequent law empow- 
ered the government to divert this revenue to the support of the courts, with promise 
of future restitution. It was not till 1817, tfirty years from the foundation of the 
State, that $1,000 was appropriated from this fund “to furnish instruction to the chil- 
dren of poor parents inreading, writing, and arithmetic.” But the protest against the 
Old World discrimination of the ‘‘least favored” of the people came swiftly on the 
heels of the effort, and the widespread discontent engendered by the attempt to enforce 
the law paralyzed the common-school movement for years to come. Here came out, 
in strong relief, the intensely aristocratic spirit of the superior society of Delaware, 
which, although long retained in the school geographies as one of the “ Middle States,” 
was, from the first, most thoroughly Southern and slaveholding till the close of the 
civil war. 
Probably the only American State that has taken the original Sunday School idea 
of Robert Raikes into its educational system is Delaware. In 1821 the State pro- 
vided that every school held on the Sabbath day for the instruction of white children 
should be subsidized at the rate of 20 cents per capita. In 1829 there were nineteen 
schools of this sort, receiving the aggregate sum of $224. This feature is still 
retained in the common-school system of the State, and each of its counties receives 
annually $500 for the maintenance of Sunday schools. Hero is perpetuated the old 
English idea of subsidizing the schools of the different religious sects. 
But no effort at amendment could reconcile the people of Delaware to the stigma 
of pauperism injected into the public-school system by even a benevolent dis- 
crimination in behalf of the poor. In this as in other States the foremost public 
men recognized the fundamental need of the people long before the church or the     
-P-A-G-E-356
  280 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
legislative bodies were prepared to surrender to the inevitable American common- 
school idea. From 1822 till 1829 a succession of governors urged in vain upon the 
legislature the establishment of a genuine system of public instruction. In 1829 the 
State school fand amounted to $151,643, with the meager annual income of $9,255—a 
bare suggestion of the sum required for even the elementary schooling of the white 
children of the State. ‘: 
_ At this crisis, as in so many similar emergencies, New England came to the rescue 
in the person of Hon, Willard Hall, for forty-eight years United States district judge 
for Delaware. Born in Massachusetts in 1780, a student at Harvard College with 
William Ellery Channing, Joseph Story, and Lemuel Shaw, he came to Delaware in 
1803, and, till the day of his death in 1875, was in almost constant receipt of public 
honors. He was appointed secretary of state in 1811, 1814, and 1821, a member of 
the State senate in 1822, and of the constitutional convention in 1831; the compiler 
of “The Laws of Delaware to 1829, Inclusive.” As early as 1822 his attention was 
attracted to the discouraging condition of popular education in the State and he 
became a resolute adyocate of school reform from the first successful legislation in 
behalf of common schools till the establishment of the present public-school system 
in 1875. 
The law of 1829 empowered the levy court to appoint five commissioners for each 
of the three counties, to divide the county into school districts in which no child 
should be more than 2 miles distant from a public elementary school, free to all white 
children and youth between the ages of 5 and 21. The voters of each district might 
- choose a clerk and 2 school commissioners and determine how much money should 
be raised by taxation, subscription, or other contributions to supplement the appor- 
tionment of the State fund. The erecting of school buildings and all matters con- 
nected with the support of the schools were there determined. A significant illus- 
tration of the estimate of woman teachers appears in the provision to supply a 
female teacher, ‘‘ when small children can attend school and others are engaged in 
the common occupations of the country.” No district could receive from the State 
board a larger sum than appropriated by itself. The governor could appoint a 
superintendent of schools for each county for a year, who, without compensation, 
should report the condition of the schools to the State. 
Here, as always, the permissive character of the statute greatly impaired the suc- 
cess of this otherwise progressive law. At first the people seem to have rallied and 
by 1833 133 districts had been organized. But the people had not been instructed 
in the alphabet of popular education, the habit of taxing themselves for a common 
school. The history of this movement for the next forty years, till 1875, is the old 
story of the persistent effort of a few eminent friends of education, under their brave 
and faithful leader, Judge Hall, to stir up legislatures and arouse the people in behalf 
of the most vital interest of the Commonwealth. In 1836 a common-school conven- 
tion was held at Wilmington, with Judge Hall as president, which almost became one 
of the permanent institutions of the State for twenty years. By its suggestion a 
portion of the United States ‘‘surplus revenue” received by the State was divided 
among the counties for educational purposes. In order to encourage the reluctant 
taxpayers, it was enacted in 1837 that the small sum of $25, raised by taxation, should 
enable a district to receive State aid. By 1843 the school fund reached the sum of 
$183,000; there were 182 schools in operation, with 6,148 pupils, supported at an 
expense of $32,000. 
Up to the year 1818 the higher education had no position in Delaware. The sons 
of the superior families were educated in the various colleges of the country, and 
teachers from other States were employed as private tutors in families and to fit 
youth at home for college. In 1818 the Newark Academy was authorized to raise 
$50,000 by lottery to establish a college. In 1821 a tax on steamboat and stage lines 
was added to its emoluments. In 1835 a further permission to raise another $50,000 
by lottery was given. Newark College was established and buildings erected in 1833.
-P-A-G-E-357
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 281 
Among the eminent men appointed as trustees of the institution we come upon the 
familiar name of Willard Hall, whose life for a full half century seems to have been 
bound up in this sacred cause. The college was opened in 1834 with 10 professors, 
aud Dr. Gilbert, a native of New York, was appointed to the presidency. He 
resigned in 1835 from conscientious scruples concerning the support of the college 
by a lottery and general discouragement. His successor remained in office but five 
years, and in 1840 the college had but 42 students, 19 in the preparatory department, 
although in former years the number had reached 71. Dr. Gilbert returned to the 
presidency in 1840. . The continued progress of the institution, thus founded in the 
day of small things, will be noted elsewhere. It appears as a recognized Delaware 
State college in 1869. But from its foundation till 1850 there were but 77 graduates, 
and but 270 till 1892. The roll includes a large proportion of the distinguished men 
of Delaware, with students from some other States. 
In 1829 the public schools of Wilmington, the chief and the only considerable city 
in the State, were brought to the head and front of common-school education in 
Delaware. Beginning with 10 districts, 8 of them in 1834 united in a union school. 
In 1836 there were 716 pupils and instructors. The present excellent system of com- 
mon schools in Wilmington practically dates from the year 1852, when, by special 
act, a complete system of popular instruction was established under the control of a 
school board elected by the citizens with power to act. 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
While the colonies and Commonwealths of Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware 
through the two and a half centuries of their history previous to the great civil war 
of 1860-1865, despitethe teaching of their great educational statesmen, Jefferson and 
his associates, held fast to the aristocratic British ideals of school organization and 
administration, North Carolina, both as a province and a State, from the first was 
moved by a distinct purpose to afford the opportunity of instruction to the masses 
of her white population. The limitations both of the ecclesiastical and civic policy of 
the colonial government repressed every considerable attempt in this direction pre- 
vious to the Revolution. But the elements of a defiant patriotism had already been 
gathering, largely through the incoming of the Presbyterian people moving down 
the slopes and valleys of the Appalachian region and appearing in North Carolina in 
1736. No colony was ahead of the old North province in the disposition to ‘‘show 
fight” for American independence. Baffled in the effort to establish a university of 
the progressive type by the veto of the home government, the people rallied about 
the few academies of the superior sort open to their children and, at an early period 
of the war of independence, their representatives placed in the first constitution of 
1776 the comprehensive declaration, almost a verbal reproduction of a similar clause 
in the new constitution of Pennsylvania: ‘‘A school or schools shall be established 
by, the legislature for the convenient instruction of youth, with such salaries to the 
masters, paid by the public, as may enable them to instruct at low prices; and all 
useful learning shall be duly encouraged and promoted in one or more universities.” 
It has already been sufficiently explained why the original States beyond the 
Hudson River were practically compelled to originate the great enterprise of edu- 
eating their people by the European method of the establishment of a university and 
the very gradual descent, through the development of the denominational religious 
college and various forms of the secondary academy, toward the people’s elementary 
common school. When we consider all the circumstances of the settlement and 
colonial history and condition of the people of North Carolina at the close of the 
Revolutionary war, none of these may claim a more honorable record for a steady 
advance toward the great consummation of the American common school than the 
old North State. Although the institution of negro slavery was, by its very genius 
and practical operation, opposed not only to the schooling of the slave class, but 
also of the important “third estate” that intervened between the planter and the

African laborer, yet in North Carolina from the beginning the so-called “middle 
class” included a larger and more important body of its population, which came to 
the front at an earlier period and in a more decided way than in the adjacent colonies, 
north and south. Had not the restless love of emigration that so early seized upon 
this portion of the Southern people during the first half century of the Republic 
depleted the State of a numerous and reliable class of its most enterprising and pro- 
gressive young men, and had not the samo impulse moved tho State to give away 
_ its splendid endowment of territory west of the mountains, there can be no doubt 
that North Carolina would have led all the Southern States in the early establish- 
ment-of a system of popular education, the nearest approach to the present American 
common school possible under her organization of society. As it was, during tho 
half century now under consideration, 1790-1840, this State did make an educational 
record, if not in some respects so brilliant as Virginia, yet beyond the Old Dominion, 
more decided at first, more steady in the upholding of the secondary education, and, 
at the close, 1835-1840, was able to place on the ground beyond dispute the best sys- 
tem of public instruction in the fourteen Southern States east of the Mississippi 
previous to the outbreak of the civil war. 
In our present essay we can only deal with the preliminary steps of this record, | 
the founding of the State University with a glance at the academic system, leaving 
for future consideration the very interesting story of the establishment of the public- 
school system which closed this era of prosperity. Even in this, as in the account 
of education in all the older Southern States before the war, we only sketch the out- 
lines of the upbuilding of the secondary and higher education, referring our readers 
for detailed information to the excellent library of ‘‘ Circulars of Information” in the 
National Bureau of Education, treating of this department of instruction in all the 
orignal Atlantic States, together with Florida and Alabama, 
It was perhaps fortunate for North Carolina that the decided movement of her 
people for a university was not, as in Virginia at a later period, antagonized by rival 
institutions representing, like William and Mary, the educational and civic ideas of 
the early colonial period, and the presence on the ground of several denominational 
colleges which represented the somewhat limited ideas of their followers. While 
North Carolina came forth from the trials of the war of Independence with her pop-- 
ulation of less than 400,000 of all classes greatly impoverished, scattered over a vast 
realm of 52,250 square miles, yet one of the first acts of the legislature was the charter 
of the University of North Carolina, with the following preamble to the act of incor- 
poration: ‘‘ Whereas in all well-regulated governments it is the indispensable duty 
of every legislature to consult the happiness of a rising generation and endeavor to 
fit them for all honorable discipline of the several duties of life by paying the strictest 
attention to their education; and whereas a university supported by permanent funds 
and well endowed would have the most direct tendency to answer the above purpose: 
“First, be it enacted,” etc. The corporation of the new school included forty of 
the most distinguished men of the State. In 1792 the university was located on*its 
present site, Chapel Hill, in Orange County, 28 miles from the capital of the State. 
The corner stone of the first building was laid October 12, 1793. A conspicuous figure 
in the occasion was Gen, William Richardson Davie, a commanding officer during the 
war, afterwards governor of North Carolina and minister of the United States to 
France. The address was delivered by Rev. Dr. 8. E. McCorkle, a native of Pena- 
sylvania, the president of several institutions, to whom was offered the first professor- 
ship, the chair of moral and political philosophy. The act of 1789 endowed the 
university with “all the property that had heretofore or should thereafter escheat 
to the State.” This fund in due time became valuable and, with several private 
benefactions, important for the time. Two lotteries and money from the legislature 
to the extent of $10,000 made up in 1862 the sum of $148,520.26. The money endow- 
ment went to wreck at the reorganization of the State after the civilwar. At present 
the State legislature subsidizes the university to the extent of $20,000 a year. : 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 283 
During the first half century of the university until 1840, its history is largely 
involved in the biography of Dr. Caldwell, its first and, with a brief interregnum, 
only president till 1835. At the beginning the school was housed in one building 
with 50students. Forty were graduated in the first ten years. Rev. David Kerr, a 
graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland, was chosen “ professor of humanity” 
and became the practical head of the institution with Prof. Charles W. Harris, and 
8. A. Holmes principal of the preparatory department. This arrangement held for 
only five years, as, in 1798, Mr. Holmes, the last of the three, resigned. The reaction 
from the policy of the Church of England establishment, under which the colony 
had remained up to the outbreak of the war, seems to have sunk deeply into the 
minds and hearts of a considerable portion of the leading people of the State and 
produced what was then-called ‘‘an outbreak of French infidelity,” representing in 
religious faith about what may be called ‘the radical wing” of the Unitarian 
Church of to-day in the United States and Great Britain. The entire faculty, includ- 
ing General Davie, were implicated in this so-called ‘‘heresy,” all of them having 
renounced their faith in Christianity as then commonly believed. Professors Kerr 
and Holmes retired to the practice of the law, in which they distinguished them- 
selves. Mr. Kerr was appointed a judge by President Jefferson. But, along with 
these theological heresies, this group of gentlemen seem to have been endowed with 
“a level head” in their ideas of the higher education suitable for the youth of a new 
American State. The curriculum is a refreshing contrast to the high classic preten- 
sions of all the colleges then in operation in the country, and about 1800 the degree 
of bachelor of arts was conferred for proficiency in the English language and the 
sciences. 
The advent of Dr. Joseph Caldwell, D. D., to an important professorship in 1796, 
followed by his chairmanship of the faculty in 1798, and appointment as first presi- 
dent in 1804, was the signal, not only for an important change in the theological tone 
of the university, but the real beginning of the era of solid work in the institution 
through the dangers and trials of its first forty years. Dr. Caldwell was a native of 
New Jersey, of Scotch and French descent, educated at Princeton, for several years 
a teacher in New Jersey and a tutor in his alma mater, and at the age of 22 called to 
the infant university of North Carolina, then the only American college south of Vir- 
ginia. He at once, in good Presbyterian fashion, took up arms against the new 
“French infidelity,” converted Colonel Davie, and stemmed the tide of ‘free 
thought” in the school. 
Dr. Caldwell resigned the presidency in 1812 and was succeeded by Rev. Robert 
H. Chapman, D.D. His influence seems not to have been sufiiciently powerful to 
check the tendency to disorder and rebellion against authority, then characteristic of 
all American colleges, and which seems to have met its first decisive check with the 
advent of Dr. Nott, at Union College in 1820. 
During the four years, 1812 to 1816, Dr. Caldwell was the professor of mathematics. 
He then resumed the presidency and held it till his death, in 1835. He gave a decided 
impulse to the study of the classics. But there was little danger of an undue atten- 
tion to this department in the face of the two great professors called to Chapel Hill 
from the North during his administration. 
The best known of these was Prof. Elisha Mitchell, called from Yale in 1817 to the 
professorship of mathematics. He soon developed the great interest in natural 
science that made him the early explorer of the splendid mountain realm of western 
North Carolina, where he lost his life in 1857 in the ascent of the mountain named 
for himself, the highest peak east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States. In 
1858 his body was removed to the highest point of this noble mountain, which 
remained until 1889 his only and fit monument. He was a prolific author in science, 
meteorology, and the geography of his adopted State. During the eighteen years 
of his professorship the university increased from 4 teachers and 120 students to 16 
professors and 440 students. 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
  284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
  Even more distinguished in national reputation was Prof. Dennison Olmsted, a class- 
mate of Dr. Mitchell at Yale, afterwards a teacher and tutor in his alma mater. He 
came in 1817, at the age of 26, to the professorship of chemistry at Chapel Hill, 
He persuaded the legislature of North Corolina to intrust to him the geological 
survey of the State, the first in the Union. In 1825 he returned to Yale as professor. 
and was widely known as an educator of the first importance, not only in his proper 
sphere of the natural sciences, but as an influential friend of popular education and 
an author of school text-books. A third Connecticut man was brought to the uni- 
versity in the person of Prof. E. A. Andrews, who was called to the chair of the 
ancient languages in 1822. He was called back to an academic school in New Haven 
in 1828, and in that place and Boston became a distinguished principal of young 
ladies’ seminaries and the author of a well-known Latin grammar. 
These fonr men of mark, representing Princeton and Yale, with others, were the 
soul of the university during the critical period of its existenée, and lifted it up to 
a distinction equal to that reached by any American college south of Virginia. The 
successor of President Caldwell in 1835 was Governor David L. Swain, the son of a 
Massachusetts emigrant to Georgia, though educated at the Newton Academy, near 
Asheville, N. C., then the one considerable village in the western part of the State. 
He was also a student in the university, of which he became president in 1835, and 
held this position through the civil war till 1868. Under his vigorous and continuous 
administration the university became famous through the South, at one time with 
461 students. All these men were, beyond their duties as college professors and 
scholars, among the foremost citizens of their adopted State; ardent friends of pop- 
ular education, stirring up the people to the development of the marvelous resources 
of this wonderful country that now, for the first time since its settlement, appears 
to be appreciated as not inferior in possibilities to any State east of the Mississippi. 
For detailed information concerning the university during these years we refer the 
reader to the excellent History of Education in North Carolina, by Charles L. Smith, 
published by the National Bureau of Education. 
So decided was the success of the State University that it postponed for half a 
century the movement toward the establishment of rival denominational colleges in 
North Carolina. Indeed, the original charter of Wake Forest College, established 
_ first in 1832 as a theological institute of the Baptist Church, upon a farm 16 miles 
from Raleigh, on the manual labor system, was obtained only by a majority of one 
in the legislature, although the State was not expected in any way to endow it. Its 
final organization as a college came in 1838. Davidson College, the child of the effort 
to found Queens College at Charlotte, by the Presbyterian body, arose from an attempt 
to found a school in the southwest corner of the State as early as 1820 under the name 
Western College. Theattempt was revived in 1835 under the name Davidson College, 
from the brave General Davidson, who died in the patriot cause. General contribu- 
tions enabled the friends of the movement to erect the buildings, and in 1837 the 
college opened with 66 students. The Methodist Church followed the example of its 
neighbors and established Trinity College, developed out of an academy founded in 
1838, near High Point, receiving its final name in 1859. The famous Moravian Female 
Academy at Salem was perhaps the first school for the superior education of young 
women set up south of Philadelphia. It was founded in 1802 and still remains one 
of the five higher institutions of learning under the control of this fraternity in the 
United States. For many years it was frequented by the daughters of the foremost 
families of all the Southern States, and is still one of the best of the female colleges 
of the Commonwealth. 
The next movement for education following the charter of the university was in 
behalf of the academic system, of which the State of North Carolina, with more 
reason than many of hersister States, has alwaysbeenproud. At different times before 
1840 a large number of these schools for the secondary education of boys and girls 
were chartered, mostly by the zeal of the different religious bodies, or by the efforts 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 285 
and contributions of the communities in which they were placed, butrarely as private 
ventures. Half a dozen of these were in existence at the organization of the State. 
Alist of more than twenty is given as established during the last twenty years of 
the eighteenth century. Several of these, like the Caldwell, McCorkle, and Queen’s 
College schools, had a well-deserved celebrity. The better-off people of the State in- 
clined to this method of schooling their children. Coeducation was a heresy till a later 
date. A full account of these seminaries may be found in the History of Educationin 
North Carolina, before referred to. Of these the most celebrated was the Bingham 
Classical School, originally planted in a log schoolhouse, by Rey. William Bing- 
ham, a native of Ireland, in 1794. It has grown with the growth of the State, always 
holding a distinguished place among Southern schools of its kind, and is now trans- 
ferred to the beautiful little mountain city of Asheville, under the management of the 
grandson of the original founder. The Friends, Lutherans, and Catholics had their 
own seminaries of the secondary education. In 1840 there were in North Carolina 2 
colleges, 141 academies and grammar schools, and 632 primary and common country 
schools; in all, 775 educational institutions with 19,453 students. 
While this development of the higher and secondary education during the first 
half century of the national life in North Carolina was very creditable, beth as to 
the number and quality of the seminaries, the final effort for a proper common-school » 
system came later, and only at the close of these years, between 1835-1840, was the 
system put on the ground.. Previous to this time there was a large amount of illiteracy 
among the humbler classes of the white people, especially in the great pine forest 
country of the coast and the vast mountain world of the west; a State in itself, even 
now but little known outside the Commonwealth. Up to 1800 it is recorded that in ten 
of the foremost counties of the State little more than half the people were instructed 
in the elements of knowledge, and at the close of the civil war North Carolina stood 
lowest of all the States in the illiteracy among its white people. But as early as 
1816, on the suggestion of the governor, the legislature appointed Hon. Archibald 
D. Murphey to prepare a scheme of public education. 
In 1817, Murphey, then a senator from Orange County, presented to the general 
assembly the report of the special committee on education, of which he was chair- 
man. In this report is proposed an elaborate system of public mstruction which 
provides for every requirement of the social system. It was so far in advance of its 
time that all its beneficent propositions have not yet been carried out. Thisscheme, 
wide in scope and large in proposition, is embraced in the report of that committee. 
Its high and lofty plane is shown in the opening paragraphs: 
“That we have much reason to thank Providence for the arrival of a period when 
our country, enjoying peace with foreign nations, and free from domestic inquietude, 
turns her attention to improving her physical resources, and the moral and intel- 
lectual condition of her citizens. The war of party spirit which for twenty years 
has disturbed her tranquillity and perverted her ambition, has terminated; and 
political strife has yielded its place to an honorable zeal for the public welfare. 
Enlightened statesmen will avail themselves of this auspicious period to place the 
fortunes of the State upon a basis not to be shaken; to found and cherish institu- 
tions which shall guarantee to the people the permanence of their government, and 
enable them to appreciate its excellence. The legislature of North Carolina, giving 
to their ambition an honorable direction, have resolved to improve this period for 
the best interests of the State; to adopt and carry into effect liberal plans of internal 
improvements; to give encouragement to literature, and to diffuse the lights of 
knowledge among all classes of the community. Let us foster the spirit which has 
gone abroad; it will lead to the happiest results. If we ourselves should not live to 
witness them, we shall at least have the satisfaction of having contributed to pro- 
duce them, and of seeing our children receive from our hands a country growing rich 
in physical resources, and advancing in moral and intellectual excellence. Thisis 
the true way of giving strength and permanence to the Government; of giving it root 
in the hearts of the people, and nurturing it with their affections. What people will 
not love a Government whose constant solicitude is for their happiness, and whose 
ambition is to elevate their character in the scale of intelligent beings? Having 
commenced this great work of humanity, let us persevere in it with a patience that

shall not die, and with a zeal that shall not abate, praying to the Father of all good 
that He will enlighten and direct our course, and finally crown our labors with 
success, 
“Your committee have entered upon the duties assigned to them with a fall con- 
viction of their importance, and of the difficulties which attend their discharge, 
But believing that let the subject be taken up where it may those difficulties will 
exist, and ay. railing themselves of the light thrown upon the ‘subject by the wisdom 
of others, they have prepared a system of public instruction for North Carolina, 
which with much deference they beg leave to submit to the consideration of the gen- 
eral assembly. In digesting this system they have adhered to the general principles 
of the report on this subject submitted by a committee to the last legislature, and 
have embraced a provision for the poor as well as rich, and a gradation of schools 
from the lowest to the highest. 
“To give effect to any plan of public education, it is essentially necessary that 
ample funds be provided, and that these funds, and also the execution of the general 
plan, be committed to the care and direction of a board composed of intelligent and 
efficient men.” 
The committee considered the subject in eight divisions: 
(1) The creation of a fund for public instruction. 
(2) The constitution of a board to manage the fund and to carry into execution the 
plan of public instruction. 
(8) The organization of schools. e 
(4) The course of studies to be prescribed for each. 
(5) The modes of instruction. 
(6) The discipline and government of the schools. 
(7) The education of poor children at the public expense. 
(8) An asylum for the deaf and dumb. 
In a special report the creation of the fund for public instruction was considered. 
The board of public instruction is the first division treated in this report. 
The report recommended that six directors constitute this “board of public 
instruction,” with the governor as chairman, ex officio; three of these directors to 
be clected by the general assembly from the counties east of Raleigh, and three from 
the western counties; the board is authorized to elect a vice-president and secretary, 
and their compensation is fixed at the same per diem as that of members of the gen- 
eral assembly. They are to have direct supervision over the entire system of publie 
education, being given the power to establish institutions and regulate courses of 
study, ‘‘and in giving effect to this plan,” says the report, ‘“‘the board shall regard 
the primary schools as its foundation.” Members of the board are ex officio trustees 
‘of the university. Section 7 recommends that “all expenses incurred in carrying 
into effect this system of public instruction and supporting the same shall be 
charged upon this fund and paid out of the proceeds thereof.” 
“In arranging the system of schools,” says the report, “your committee has 
endeavored to make the progress of education natural and regular; beginning with 
primary schoois in which the first rudiments of learning are taught, and proceeding 
to academies in which youths are to be instructed in langnages, ancient and modern 
history, mathematics, and other branches of science, preparatory to entering into 
the uniy ersity, in which instruction is to be given in ‘all the higher branches of the 
sciences and in the principles of the useful arts.” 
“Tn making this arrangement the greatest diffienlties have occurred in organizing 
the primary schools,” which, it declares, ave <fof the first importance in any general 
plan of public education.” 
In the plan for the primary schools it is proposed (1) to divide each county in 
the State into townships, to divide each township into wards of one hundred fami- 
lies, and to establish a primary school in each ward; (2) theschools are to be under 
the control and supervision of five trustees in each township, these to be appointed 
by the court of pleas and quarter sessions; these trustees to ‘select such children 
residing within this township whose parents are unable to pay for their schooling, 
who shall be taught at the said schools for three years without charge.” 
“These schools,” avers the committee, would be to the rich a convenience and to 
the poor a blessing.” 
Taking the next step in this ascending scheme of instruction, the establishment of 
academies is recommended, in which institutions the children who have passed the 
primary school may be “ instructed in languages, ancient and modern history, mathe- 
 
-P-A-G-E-363
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 287 
matics, and other branches of science, preparatory to their entering into the univer- 
sity.” The State was to be divided into 10 academical districts, in each of which an 
academy was to be established. 
A strong appeal is made for the University of North Carolina, then twenty years old. 
“At a moment,” says the report, ‘‘ when former prejudices have died away, when 
liberal ideas hegin to prevail, when the pride of the State is awakening, and an hon- 
orable ambition is cherished for her glory, an appeal is made to the patriotism and 
the generous feelings of the legislature in favor of an institution which in all civi- 
lized nations has been regarded as the nursery of moral greatness and the palladium 
of civil liberty.” 
Courses of study are recommended for all these institutions: In the primary schools 
the ‘‘three r’s,” reading, writing, and arithmetic; in the academies, Latin, Greek, 
French, English, elements of geometry, algebra, geography, ancient and modern his- 
tory; in the university, all the higher branches of learning. 
Modes of instruction and methods of discipline and government receive ample 
treatment. ‘‘The great object of education” the report declares to be “ intellectual 
and moral improvement; and that mode of instruction is to be preferred which best 
serves to effect this object. This mode is to be found only ina correct knowledge of 
the human mind, its habits, passions, and manner of operation.” The methods of 
the schools of Scotland, of Pestalozzi in Switzerland, and Joseph Lancaster in 
England are discussed. = 
“Tn a republic the first duty of a citizen is obedience to the law. We acknowledge 
no sovereign but the law, and from infaney to manhood our children should be 
taught to bow with reverence to its majesty. In childhood parental authority 
enforces the first lessons of obedience; in youth this authority is aided by the munic- 
ipal law, which in manhood wields the entire supremacy.” 
There was need of disciplining at the time, for the committee recalls the fact that 
«riot and disorder have dishonored all the colleges and universities of the Union. 
The temples of science have been converted into theaters for acting disgraceful scenes 
of licentiousness and rebellion.” 
“The amusements of youth may also be made auxiliary to the exactness of disci- 
pline,” states the report, and Thomas Jefferson’s utterances regarding ‘‘ manuel ” 
exercise and military discipline are quoted.    
“One of the strongest reasons which we can have for establishing a general plan 
of public instruction is the condition of the poor children of our country. Such 
always has been, and probably always will be, the allotments of human life that 
the poor will form a large portion of every community; and it is the duty of those 
who manage the affairs of State to extend relief to this unfortunate part of our spe- 
cies in every way in their power. Providence, in the impartial distribution of its 
favors, whilst it has denied to the poor many of the comforts of life, has generally 
bestowed upon them the blessing of intelligent children. Poverty is the school of 
genius; itis a school in which the active powers of man are developed and disci- 
plined, and in which that moral courage is acquired which enables him to toil with 
difficulties, privations, and want. From this school generally come forth those men 
who act the principal parts upon the theater of life; men who impress a character 
upon the age in which they live. But it is a school which if left to itself runs wild; 
vice in all its depraved forms grows up under it. The State should take this school 
under her special care, and maturing the genius which there grows in rich luxuri- 
ance, give to it an honorable and profitable direction. Poor children are the pecul- 
jar property of tho State, and by proper cultivation they will constitute a fund of 
- moral and intellectual worth which will greatly subserve the public interest.” 
Thus does this scheme of education rise round upon round until the top rung of 
scholarship is reached. 
It is like some finely proportioned Grecian temple whose marble columns rise in 
stately perfection. 
But the time was not ripe for its realization. And it is laid aside in the same cab- 
inet with the intricate constitution of John Locke. 
The ending comes like a benediction: 
“ When this or some other more judicious plan of public education shall be carried 
into execution, when light and knowledge shall be shed upon all, may we not indulge
-P-A-G-E-364
  288 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
the hope that men will be convinced that wisdom’s ways are ways of pleasantness 
and all her paths are paths of peace; and be induced by such conviction to regulate 
their conduct by the rule of Christian morality, of domg unto others as they wish 
they would do unto them; and that they will learn to do justly, to love mercy, and to 
walk humbly before their God?” 
The question remained in ‘innocuous desuetude” till 1825, when the beginnings 
of a common-school fund were made. This considerable sum was further increased 
by the transfer of the share of the State in the national surplus revenue to the hand- 
some figure of $2,000,000. 
Then first did the Commonwealth move decidedly to give to the mass of its white 
children the opportunity for the education for which the people had pleaded through 
two centuries of its previous history. The plan proposed to divide the State into 1,250 
school districts, each with aschoolhouse, a normal department attached to the State 
university for the training of teachers; and $100,000, the income of the State literary 
fund, distributed at the rate of $2.40 to each scholar; a local tax, the amount to be 
imposed by the county court; all to be supervised by five superintendents for each 
county and three committeemen for each district; the system to be crowned by a 
State superintendency of schools. But the plan as it came forth from the legislature 
was shorn of several of its most useful features. Nearly every county of the State 
voted for the system and in 1840 the first common-school law was enacted and remained 
in operation until 1852, when it passed under the charge of a State superintendency. 
This movement was really a part of that great revival of education which swept 
like a ‘celestial breeze” from a heavenly land through the Republic in the decade 
from 1830 to 1840, and was felt in the Southland most powerfully in the Old North 
State. It may be added that when the civil war broke upon the land it found this 
State in possession of the most hopeful system of public instruction in the South, 
save perhaps Missouri and Kentucky. 
Napoleon said, when preparing to cross the Alps with his army to Italy: ‘‘ Where 
a goat can go a man can go, and where a man can go an army can go.” One of the 
interesting elements in the history of education in North Carolina before the civil 
war, as concerned the education of the negro, was noted in the experience of the 
Rey. John Chavis. This young man, born free, was sent to Princeton College by 
some interested friends, “to see if a negro was capable of receiving a college educa- 
tion.” In 1805, having demonstrated this possibility, he returned to North Carolina 
as a minister of the Presbyterian Church, became the pastor of several churches, 
preaching not only to colored but to white people, was noted for the correctness of 
his speech and the ‘entire orthodoxy” of his teaching. He opened a classical 
school in three counties of the State, which was attended by many students that 
afterwards became distinguished men in the Commonwealth, and it is added that 
‘‘his school was the best at that time to be found in the State” To-day no well- 
informed man in North Carolina doubts the ability of the negro race to receive 
education, and the children of its former slaves are educated, with equal advantages 
with the white students, in the public schools, while a large number of excellent 
seminaries of the secondary and even higher instruction are in operation, supported 
by the bounty of benevolent people and tuition fees, and aided by the missionary 
boards of the great Northern churches of all religious denominations. 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
At the close of the war of independence the State of South Carolina, with an area 
of 30,000 square miles—larger than all New England outside of Maine, and near the 
area of that extreme northeastern State—had a population of 249,000, of whom 107,000 
were negro slaves. In estimating the efforts of the Southern States for education 
previous to 1860 we must not forget that only to the white population was this term 
applied. The educational record of South Carolina for the seventy-five years from
-P-A-G-E-365
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 289 
1790 to 1865 represents the effort at first of only 142,000 white people, with a school 
population of 25,000 from 6 to 15 years of age, not altogether exceeding the number 
of children and youth in a Northern city of 200,000 inhabitants, scattered over an 
extensive territory, which was largely an unsettled wilderness, divided into an upper 
and lower country as jealous of each other as any two sections of the Union; even 
the more favored planter class in sore financial straits and the masses of the white 
people in great poverty, with the social extremes of a highly cultivated superior 
class and a lower estate almost destitute of the elements of instruction in letters to 
educate itself. 
But, as shown in the interesting essay of Mr. McCrady already quoted, the colony 
had not been especially wanting in its provisions for the higher education. With 
several vigorous academies at home and the almost universal habit of sending the 
young men of the superior families to England for university and professional train- 
ing and acertain amount of tutorship in wealthy families, a strong sentiment for 
the higher education had been implanted in the leading minds of the new Common- 
wealth. As early as 1770 a movement was made for a college at Charleston, and in 
1785 a charter was obtained, with gifts from private sources amounting to $50,000, 
and the beginning of alibrary. The legislature responded to the demand of the “up 
country” by chartering two similar institutions—at Winnsboro in the northeast and 
at Cambridge in the southwest. A donation of land fixed the location at Charleston, 
where, in 1785, the Charleston College, still in vigorous existence, was set up, with 
Rev. (afterwards Bishop) Robert Scott as first president. But in 1797 the move- 
ment went into a temporary eclipse after graduating several men afterwards emi- 
nent in State affairs, only to be revived in 1823-24. In 1827 the Rev. Joseph Adams 
was called from Brown University, Rhode Island, and under his able and hopeful 
administration the school rallied and assumed a respectable rank among the smaller 
colleges of the country. 
From this date it encountered the formidable rivalry of the State College at 
Columbia and has always been practically a Charleston seminary. On the departure 
of President Adams, in 1837, the city assumed the control and until recently hag 
aided its funds by a generous subsidy. The college has also at different times been 
the recipient of several considerable gifts, and to-day is perhaps the best endowed 
institution of learning in the State. Its museum of natural history was established 
or greatly aided by the suggestion of Professor Agassiz in 1851. Up to 1885 the 
graduates numbered 368, among whom are the names of many well and honorably 
known in thecity and State. Under the present management of Dr. Henry E. Shepherd, 
the college still remains the proper head of the excellent educational system of the 
city and is especially known for its course in the English language and literature. 
In the future development of Charleston this foundation may be built upon as the 
most important center of the higher education on the Southern Atlantic Coast. The 
Winnsboro ‘Mount Zion” institution is at present incorporated in the graded public 
school system of that city. 
In no Atlantic Southern State did the jealousy between the ruling planter class of 
the low country and the farmers of the ‘‘ Piedmout district” reach a higher point 
than in South Carolina during the period following the Revolutionary war. It was 
with an honest attempt to reconcile this difference and extend the opportunities of 
education to the upland region, at that time in dire need even of elementary school- 
ing, that the famous school of Moses Waddell was established in 1804 in the Abbe- 
ville district, near the Savannah River. As a fine specimen of the old-time classical 
seminary consecrated to ‘‘ lean living” and hard study, with a Spartan discipline, it 
was not surpassed by any school of its day. While in full operation, from 1804 to 
1819, when Dr. Waddell was called to the presidency of the University of Georgia, it 
was, beyond question, the most effective school in the State, numbering among its 
students John C. Calhoun and George McDuffie, with numbers of the promising 
country boys of the upland region. It is probable that from this little rural seat of 
ED 96 10

  290 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
learning came the foremost group of distinguished public men whose influence more 
and more dominated the political destiny of the State, even to the breaking out of 
the civil war. 
Other efforts in this region, especially on the line of manual-labor schools, are on 
record, ending, as did all this class of seminaries, in speedy failure. But in 1801 the 
legislature moved for the establishment of the South Carolina College by a grant of 
$50,000 for buildings and an annual subsidy of $6,000. Fer this movement the State 
seems to have been largely indebted to Paul Hamilton, the most conspicuous figure 
in the educational affairs of the period. Of Scotch descent and limited educational 
opportunities, at the age of 16 he enlisted in the patriot army and fought through 
till the end. His public career began in 1785. He steadily rose through the legisla- 
ture to the office of comptroller of the State, his public hfe closing by a seat in the 
- Cabinet of President James Madison as Secretary ef the Navy. 
In 1801 Governor Dayton called attention to the obligation of the State to estab- 
lish ‘‘free colleges,” and in due time a committee of the foremost members of the 
legislature reported a plan for the organization of the College of South Carolina, 
under thirteen trustees, appointed by the legislaturo for four years, with several 
State officials as ex-officio members. This body seems to have had little authority in 
the management of the college, the real direction being given to the faculty. The 
new seminary was established at Columbia, the State capital, in a location that still 
remains one of the most attractive of all the university grounds of the country. 
Columbia was then a village of 4,000 people, on the Congaree River, and is still 
almost a city in & wilderness, the prospect from the university towers extending in 
one direction over a primitive forest from 30 to 40 miles. 
One of the most powerful motives for the establishment of this seat of learning 
was the laudable desire to ‘unify the State” by mollifying the antagonism between 
the upper and lower sections. This was perpetuated till the outbreak of the civil 
war by the original apportionment of representation in the legislature in which, by 
a property basis of representation, the coast region with its great wealth and over- 
whelming slave population, with a minority of voting citizenship, was able to con- 
trol the public affairs of the Commonwealth. As far as a liberal education could 
develop the natural capacity of the upper portion of the State, the college was a 
great success, and many of the most important men of all professions were among its 
graduates. From the first its affairs took on the generous air of the old South Caro- 
lina gentry in respect to appropriations from the State and the support of its faculty. 
At first, the salary of the president was $2,500 and of each professor $1,500, includ- 
ing a house. Ata later date the president’s salary was $3,500, the professors $2,000, 
and a tutor $1,000. In the six years from 1814 to 1820 the State had given $286,659 
to the college. It was fortunate that, like the University of Virginia at a later and 
of North Carolina at an earlier date, the College of South Carolina planted itself on 
abroad unsectarian religious platform from which it has never deviated, though often 
maintaining it in the face of opposition from the denominational colleges and acad- 
emies of the State. 
While yet in its childhood, with a student population of 46, the college had the 
great good fortune to have as its president Rev. Dr. Maxcy, a native of Massachu- 
setts, a graduate and for a time president of Brown University, Rhode Island, after- 
wards president of Union College, New York, from which he was called, in 1804, to 
the same position in the College of South Carolina. By persistent effort, sometimes 
involving him in conflict with his trustees and faculty, he built up an effective col- 
lege curriculum, although, until 1820, the study of the classical languages closed 
with the freshman year. But after 1829 the Latin language became an important 
feature in the course of instruction. 
At the death of President Maxcy in 1820 the college passed under the presidency 
of Thomas Cooper, at the time professor of mathematics. This remarkable man 
was born in London in 1759 and was educated at Oxford University. He very early

seems to have displayed that fierce radical temperament and furious passion for 
personal liberty, amounting to violent eccentricity, which dominated him through 
life and made him always and everywhere one of the most conspicuous leaders of 
the party of agitation of church, state, and education. A four months’ residence in 
Paris, at the height of the French Revolution, in full communion with the leading 
spirits of that troubled era, exposed him to grave suspicions and even denunciation 
in Parliament on his return to England. He came to America, married the daughter 
of the famous Dr. Joseph Priestly, and settled in Pennsylvania as a lawyer. A 
violent attack on President John Adams, in 1800, brought him in collision with the 
alien and sedition law with a penalty of $400 and six months imprisonment. The 
fine was afterwards refunded with interest, although the six months in jail rankled 
in his memory to the end. John Adams, one of the best haters of a period dis- 
tinguished for good hating, threw in tho additional exasperation of denouncing 
Cooper as “a learned, ingenious, scientific, and talented madman.” Afterwards 
appointed a judge in Pennsylvania, he was impeached and removed from office at the 
end of five years for intolerable self-will and freaks of petty tyranny. He now took 
to tho more peaceable work of education and was appointed a professor of chemistry 
in Dickinson College and afterwards in the University of Pennsylvania. - 
All this was but a recommendation to Thomas Jefferson, who, in sympathy with 
extreme views, was always liable to be what John Adams was not. Cooper was 
named as the first professor of the University of Virginia, but the clergy of the State 
raised a tumult that compelled the withdrawal of his name. This was to the intense 
disgust of Jefferson, who declared that Cooper was the man to whom he especially 
looked as the corner stone of his university—‘‘the greatest man in America in power 
of mind and original information.” 
But for some reason all these things did not militate against his appointment as 
professor, and, on the death of President Maxcy in 1820, as president of the College 
of South Carolina. This position he held till 1834, Of the success of his adminis- 
tration as a vigorous and aggressive teacher there can be no question. He raised a 
tempest in the Dead Sea of the old-time superficiality and woke up the mind of young 
South Carolina as it had never been stirred before. He was especially successful as 
a lecturer on history and political economy, in the latter science indoctrinating his 
pupils with the theory of free trade, which played so important a part in the future 
public life of that State. He did his best to lift the ancient languages to the foremost 
place in the scheme of instruction and was in sympathy with a broad study of math- 
ematics and naturalsciences. His personal eccentricities were fair game for the crowd 
of turbulent boys that made the life of a professor in a Southern college seventy-five 
years ago ‘‘a hard road to travel.” But his one unpardonable offense of what was then 
called ‘‘free thought,” or “infidelity,” kept him in hot water through his entire 
administration and finally brought him to a trial before the college authorities. 
Acquitted by them of serious fault, he still felt compelled to resign his presidency and 
retire to outside work, as the compiler of the laws of the State. He was occupied 
with constant authorship till his death in 1839. 
It is not easy in his case as in that of Jefferson, Franklin, and other eminent 
characters of that day, to decide in just what his ‘‘ infidelity” consisted. With these, 
and Calhoun and Marshall afterwards, he would probably now be received as a mem- 
ber ‘‘in full communion” with a large portion of what is called “ the liberal wing” 
of several Christian denominations of the present day. Certainly, in his views of 
the Old Testament inspiration and authorship, he did not go beyond the opinions 
of the most distinguished representatives of the ‘‘ higher criticism” in Europe and 
America. Could his opinions have been combined with a more courteous manner 
and toleration he, perhaps, would not have fallen by the way. He still remains one 
of the most interesting of the original university men of the country, and his just 
biography would be a decided addition to the educational and civic chronicles of 
the early American history. 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
292 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96, 
From all sources of information we gather the testimony to the turbulent and reck- 
Jess condition of student society in this, as in so many other of the early American 
colleges. In the case of South Carolina this is especially notable. The autobiogra- 
phy of the celebrated Dr. Marion Sims, once a student in the college, is especially 
full in this respect, as of the state of society in the northwestern counties of South 
Carolina and afterwards the newly settled State of Alabama. Still, religious services 
were made a part of the regular college exercises, and on the appointment of Robert 
W. Barnwell as successor to President Cooper, in 1835, a professorship of the evidences 
of Christianity was appointed and strict religious observances established. But the 
college had suffered such diminution from the excitement of the Cooper episode that 
the sympathies of the religious sects were alienated and only twenty students remained. 
It was not till the appointment to the presidency of Hon. William C. Preston, in 1845, 
that the reaction came. This gentleman, celebrated in his day as one of the most 
accomplished orators of the Union, after his retirement from the Senate of the United 
States in 1842, was persuaded to accept this office in 1845. During the five years of 
his administration the number of students reached 237, with an average of 191, the 
largest in its history. The record of the college from the retirement of President 
Cooper in 1834 and during the administrations of Preston, Thornwell, and Lieber, and 
its great influence on the higher life of the State, are not in place here. 
From its foundation the College of South Carolina has been in fact what so many 
similar institutions have been only in name, the proper head of the public scheme of 
education. All the remaining colleges of the State represent the different denomina- 
tional religious bodies, and all were established at a period subsequent to that now 
under consideration. 
In 1811 the legislature, on petition of several counties, moved to establish what 
was evidently intended as a working system of free common schools, open to all 
white children of school age. The law provided: (1) That in every election district 
there should be established as many schools as it had representatives to the lower 
branch of the legislature. (2) The ‘‘three r’s” should be taught with such additional 
studies as the commissioners might direct. (3) While every white child of suitable 
age in the district had the right to this instruction, the preference should be given 
to destitute orphans and the children of the poor, in case of a deficiency of funds. (4) 
Three hundred dollars was appropriated for each school, while the people were 
required to furnish a schoolhouse. (5) The legislature was directed to appoint not 
Jess than three nor more than thirteen commissioners, with power to establish and 
supervise schools, distribute funds, and increase or diminish the number of scholars, 
fix the curriculum, etc. But this was declared a provisional and experimental 
arrangement, until the establishment of a permanent system. The commissioners 
were directed to make an annual report to the legislature. 
Here would certainly appear to be a hopeful beginning. But it has been said by 
one of the most accomplished educators of the State: ‘In no country or Common- 
wealth has there been witnessed so remarkable a spectacle of unanimity of purpose 
among the leaders of public opinion on the subject of popular education, with almost 
utter failure of results, as in South Carolina.” In 1847 a comprehensive and search- 
ing report to the legislature, prepared by Mr. Henry Summer, as chairman of the 
committee on education, declares that ‘‘ nothing was done worthy so sacred a cause 
as education.” The annual appropriations by the State which, for a period of forty 
years, averaged $37,000, was of itself a pittance for the education of at least 50,000 
children and youth in need of elementary schooling. One hundred and thirty-three 
schools were at once established. With the following years this number gradually 
increased. In 1828 there were 840 schools and 9,000 pupils; in 1840, 563 schools and 
12,526 pupils. But in 1847, according to this report, ‘‘it was declared in the legis- 
lature that the free-school system was a failure, and no one contradicted it.” In 
1839-40 legislative reports had attracted little attention and the urgent appeals of 
different governors failed to stir the slumbrous fathers of the State. ‘‘ Resolution
-P-A-G-E-369

after resolution had been passed approving the free-school system and recommend- 
ing that something be done to diffuse a greater amount of knowledge among the 
children of the State, and committees appointed at different times to report on the 
subject. But nothing had been done.” Meanwhile the State was gaining in popu- 
lation and influential position in national affairs. 
Indeed it was during this period that South Carolina came to the front in a most 
conspicuous way as a leader in the movement for free trade, coupled with the 
extreme theory of States rights and including the right of the nullification of national 
laws implying the right of secession from the Union. Her statesmen in Congress 
were the peers of any in eloquence and general ability. But still, in 1840, it was 
reported that 20,000 of her white adult population were illiterate, and of her 50,000 
children and youth of school age not one-fourth were under any form of public 
instruction and probably half were growing to manhood and womanhood with the 
most meager educational opportunities. At the same time it was reported that there 
were in the State one college with 168 students; 117 academies and grammar schools, 
with 4,326 pupils; 566 primary schools, with 12,520 scholars; in all, 17,000 of the 
52,000 between 6 and 16 at school. Of these but 3,524 were ‘‘at public charge.” A 
system of ‘‘combination schools” had grown up, as in other States at a recent date, 
which, private or denominational in their character and removed entirely from 
public supervision, were permitted to appropriate the public funds and give free 
schooling to such “poor children” as should be assigned by the commissioners. 
The causes of this failure can not be found so much in popular opposition to 
education as in a radical condition of society in South Carolina which continued 
until the civil war. This is well expressed in an able article in the Southern Quar- 
terly Review, in this pregnant statement: ‘‘ While the popular habit of the South 
Carolina people is essentially centrifugal, the politicans and statesmen have strong 
centralizing tendencies.” No reader of American history will impute to statesmen 
like Hayne, Calhoun, and McDuffie, a ‘‘strong centralizing tendency” in national 
affairs. The fact seems to be that, while all classes shared alike in the assertion of 
extreme personal and local independency, the ablest public men saw clearly the 
prodigious disadvantage of this political habit in State affairs and endeavored to 
support a real government at the State capital, while the masses insisted on the 
logical application of the favorite theory and lived almost without a sense of public 
responsibility to the government at Columbia. The same writer asserts that “a 
stranger might live among us for years and see no traces of government.” ‘Out of 
the towns no organization exists below that of the State,” save a few commissioners 
for absolutely essential public action. ‘As organized members of a Republic, our 
districts and parishes have absolutely no political existence.” It is curious to note 
how the sensitiveness of the State in its relations to the General Government reap- 
peared in every little district in a jealousy of State legislative action and a practical 
nullification of alllaws not agreeable to the people. The power of great families and 
influential political leaders in their several localities; the jealousies between differ- 
ent portions of the State, which almost divided the Commonwealth into little hostile 
nations, added to the lack of effective organization even for local purposes, were the 
radical causes of the failure of this attempt to school the children. The different 
districts received the funds appropriated by the State, but failed to report to the 
legislature in regard to their use. In 1817, of 45 districts 31 made no report; in the 
most favorable years not one-half appeared in a report to the legislature. Up to 
1821, ten years, $302,490 had been expended by the State. 
It is easy to see how any amount of money could have been practically wasted 
under an administration so inefficient. ‘‘ Combination schools” would absorb a good 
deal; incompetent teachers, appointed by favoritism in useless schools, would make 
way with more, The ‘‘poor people” were always in a state of protest against a 
system that held them up as subjects of public charity, and thousands of children 
were kept out of school by this cause alone. A meager appropriation, incompetent

  294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
teachers, neglect of duty by commissioners, poor school buildings—the whole train 
of evils that follow a lack of effective supervision—were sufficient to account for 
the failure of these schools. Mr. Summer declares in his illuminating report that 
“the commissioners are absolutely independent and irresponsible.” ‘There is no 
central power which can control matters and which could inspire a common spirit 
and life in the whole system.” ‘‘After all our legislation we have not even the ele- 
ments in practical operation of a system of public schools; we have the whole work 
to begin over.” 
A fatal defect in the system was also the apportionment of the school moneys to 
different districts, according to their representation in the legislature. Until the 
civil war tho system of legislative representation in South Carolina was based on 
property. This gave to the low country, where were found the great plantations 
and wealthy slaveholders, a preponderating influence in public affairs, and did much 
to perpetuate the hostility between different sections of the Commonwealth. As 
acase in point, the district of Spartanburg, in the Piedmont country, with a larger 
yoting population than the two parishes of Charleston, had but five members in the 
legislature, while the city had seventeen. The school appropriation for Spartanburg 
was but $1,500, while Charleston received $5,100 for a smaller number of pupils. 
One great district, St. John’s parish, containing 700 square miles, its extremes being 
60 miles apart, its two sections divided by a deep river, had but one school, located 
according to ‘‘pulling and hauling” of patrons or the whim of commissioners. With 
tight Mr. Summer declares at the conclusion of his report: ‘‘If the State does not 
arouse from this torpor she will see men as trees walking.” The prophecy came to 
fulfillment during the memorable era of ‘‘ reconstruction,” 1865-1876, when the 
people saw their beloved State College changed to a normal school for the freedmen 
and the first State superintendent of education appointed from a little mountain 
town in Massachusetts. 
But with allits defects, this experiment, persisted in with pathetic obstinacy for 
morethan fifty years, bears testimony to the great desire of the masses of the people 
of South Carolina for an effective system of schools for the children under the direc- 
tion of the State. Poor as it was, it did lift many thousands above the slough of 
illiteracy and kept alive the ‘‘hope deferred” from generation to generation. The 
great desire of the people for education was manifested by their acceptance of the 
system established in the era of reconstruction, notwithstanding objectionable 
features. And when the first native State superintendent of schools appeared in 
the person of that eminent and admirable public official, Hon. Hugh 8. Thompson, 
in 1877, the people responded in the establishment of a proper school system that 
has survived the storm of recent politics, even as the old time schools of the State 
still went on through all the furious excitements that shook South Carolina from her 
sea islands to Cxsar’s Head, from 1830 to the outbreak of the civil war. 
The city of Charleston was from the first the educational head of South Carolina, 
as it remains to the present day. In fact no city of similar population in the South- 
ern States can boast of better or a greater variety of schools for both races. In 1790 
the city established the Orphan House, an excellent asylum with an elementary 
school attachment, which has been supported from its beginning by the city at an 
“annual expense of $20,000. Its income is derived from private endowments and the 
grant of escheated property to the extent of $50,000. More than 4,000 orphan chil- 
dren have been educated and protected within its walls, and afterwards apprenticed 
to various trades and occupations. 
During the years 1840-1845 the plans were developed for the establishment of the 
South Carolina Military Academy. This institution combines the feature of military 
training with a thorough course in the physical sciences, mathematics, history, Eng- 
lish, and modern languages. It has graduated many of the foremost men of the 
State, and remains to-day in Charleston a State public school, until recently included 
in the corporation of the University of South Carolina.

  EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 295 
The free schools of Charleston date from the passage of the act of 1811, with an 
attendance in 1812 of 200, which increased by 1834 to 534... At a later date, 1849-1854, 
under the suggestions of Dr. Henry Barnard, of Connecticut, who was invited to the 
State by the public authorities, a new departure was made, under which very satis- 
factory results were obtained; the schools in 1860 containing more than 4,000 white 
pupils. 
Notwithstanding the early establishment of negro slavery in South Carolina, the 
population of the State in 1790 being nearly half of that race, there was always a 
good deal of effort for the religious and somewhat for the school education of the 
slave. In 1744 a school was established, probably for free negroes, under the direc- 
tion of the English Society for the Propagation of the Gespel in Foreign Parts. 
Until 1834, when by reason of the increasing excitement of the public mind caused 
by several attempts at slave insurrections the school instruction of the slaves was 
prohibited by law, this movement was an important feature in the development of 
the race in connection with religious and sometimes industrial training. It is prob- 
able that in a quiet way in private this work went on up to the outbreak of the civil 
war. It was found, after emancipation, that all the mechanical trades were repre- 
sented among these people, a portion of whom were free and themselves slaveholders, 
Under the providence of God this institution, so fatal to the peace of the slave 
States and disastrous to the entire social system of which it was the foundation, was 
probably the greatest elevator of a savage race in range of a Christian civilization 
through a period not exceeding two hundred and fifty years, of which there is a 
record in the history of mankind. 
Here we leave the deeply interesting story of popular education in South Carolina, 
especially relating to the public schooling in all grades of institutions found within 
the State. It may be said, in passing, that in no Southern State was so much 
done at public expense previous to the civil war for the schooling of the people in 
proportion to the white population and with due consideration of circumstances 
asin this State. The colleges of Charleston and of South Carolina, the academy of 
Winnsboro, the Orphan House cf Charleston, the State Military Academy—with fre- 
quent gifts to private and denominational seminaries, bear testimony to the persist- 
ent interest of the people in the secondary and higher education. The continuous 
effort to build up a good system of public schools for the white children and youth 
failed rather from the peculiar organization of society itself outside the towns, 
whereby the masses of the people seem to have been left almost powerless to act in 
behalf of any good thing, than from indifference or hostility to the sacred cause. 
Certain it is that no State of the South can point to a larger number of eminent 
friends of universal education among its leading men than this Commonwealth. 
GEORGIA. 
It was a significant coincidence that the first public notice of education in Geor- 
gia after the war of the Revolution should have been made by Governor Lyman 
Hall, a native of Connecticut, who had been sent as a delegate to the first Conti- 
nental Congress by the New England colony in St. John’s Parish, afterwards Liberty 
County, before the province had come to the decision to resist the home government. 
On January 8, 1783, Governor Hall said in his message to the legislature: ‘It will 
be your wisdom to lay an early foundation for enduring seminaries of learning; nor 
can you, I conceive, lay a better than by a grant of a sufficient tract of land that 
may, as in other governments, hereafter, by lease or otherwise, raise a revenue sufii- 
cient to support such valuable institutions.” 
The constitution of Georgia of 1777 had already provided that schools should be 
erected in each county, and supported at the general expense of the State. On July 
31, 1783, in immediate response to the executive message, the governor was empow- 
ered to lay out the reserve land, in the town of Augusta, then the capital of the 
State, into lots for the erection of ‘‘a university or seminary of learning and other  
-P-A-G-E-372
296 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
purposes.” By the same act the governor was authorized to grant 1,000 acres of land 
for a free school in each county. The act also included a provision for the establish- 
ment of an academy in each of three counties, the most important of which, the 
Academy of Richmond County, was opened in 1785. The master, an importation from 
Maryland, taught the classical and English languages, mathematics, and common 
branches. The tuition was $10 per quarter. Beginning with the master and two 
teachers, this school has gone on till the present day, when, in new buildings, it 
forms the highest department of the public-school system of Augusta. 
In 1784-85 this preliminary legislation was supplemented by the act establishing 
the University of Georgia. Two counties “out west,” now near the center of the 
State, Franklin and Washington, were laid out, with a grant of 40,000 acres of wild 
land, for the endowment of ‘a college or seminary of learning.” Trustees were 
appointed, who, with the governor, were empowered to put the act in operation. 
Here again we meet the beneficent influence of New England in the presence of 
Abraham Baldwin, a graduate of Yale College, who originated the plan for the Uni- 
versity of Georgia and obtained the legislative grant of land for its foundation. 
In 1785 this act was expanded into a broader statute, which, for a century past, 
has fixed the status of the relation of the Commonwealth of Georgia to the educa- 
tion of its people. After an elaborate preamble, reciting the advantages of education 
to the State and the “humiliation” of sending the youth of the State to foreign 
countries for the schooling proper to republican institutions, this act empowered the 
trustees aforesaid to establish ‘‘ the University of Georgia.” But, like the action of 
the State of New York about the same time, the university idea was so extended as 
to include all grades of schools supported or subsidized by the State. To-day every 
public school in Georgia is legally a part of the State University. The administering 
of this vast responsibility was placed upon two heads, one a “board of visitors,” 
composed of high State officials, the second a ‘‘ board of thirteen trustees,” elected 
by the legislature. A section of the act declared that ‘all public schools instituted 
or to be supported by funds or public moneys in this State shall be considered as 
parts and members of the university and shall be under the foregoing direction and 
regulation.” By the same statute all officers of the university were required to be 
“of the Christian religion” and to publicly take the oath of allegiance. The reli- 
gious test for the officers of the university was afterwards abolished in consideration 
of the Hebrew connection of one of the professors or trustees. But in the personal 
direction of the university, as in Harvard and Yale, we find the broad provision that 
no person is to be refused education on account of his religious convictions. 
But this effort was too great to be expanded at once into a working system of pub- 
lic education. Thirteen years later, in 1798, although the State constitution of that 
- date required the coming legislature to take measures to establish the university, 
there was found no pecuniary backing of the enterprise save the 40,000 acres of wild 
land in a region infested by hostile Indians, and not worth altogether $1,000. Land 
was too plenty and cheap, every family of settlers being offered by the State 200 
acres, ‘‘ with 50 acres additional for every member, young or old, white or black.” 
The college estate would not have brought three cents an acre. Even of this, 5,000 
acres had been ceded away to South Carolina in a boundary settlement. The finan- 
cial knot was cut by Governor John Millege, by a donation of 600 acres of land in 
the present location of the pleasant little city of Athens. 
With this meager outfit, in 1801, the university began its course under the presi- 
deney of Dr. Josiah Meigs, in a city of two houses, with a framed building of one 
room as its only home, and the great trees of the forest and the broad campus of “all 
out doors” as an annex. Until 1811 this grandfather of Georgia college presidents 
labored, with no aid, conducting recitations under the shadows of a giant oak, and 
graduating fifty students, some of whom were among the future leading men of the 
State. At the close of Dr. Meigs’s presidency the “university” took a breathing 
spell of one year, and then called Rey. John Brown, who held on till 1816, graduat- 
 
-P-A-G-E-373
  EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 297 
ing twenty students. In 1815 the money question was solved by the sale of all the 
college lands, from which $150,000 was realized. The State reimbursed itself from 
the odd $50,000 and placed the $100,000 in an 8 per cent stock as a permanent fund. 
From this foundation the aniversity has received $8,000 annually from the State. 
Thisarrangement was consummated in 1821. Since then the State has made this annual 
grant to the university under the steady disapproval of a majority of the denomi- 
national colleges. These enlarge on the fact that the University of Georgia has, 
during the past one hundred years, with its ‘‘branches,” absorbed $1,200,000 of the © 
people’s money, while the Commonwealth could have expended its means to better 
advantage by giving the opportunities of elementary education to the masses and 
leaving the secondary and higher education to the care of private and church support. 
But certainly, until 1819, the University of Georgia was not dying of the “dry 
rot” of luxury. At that date, fifteen years after its inauguration, ‘‘there were 
neither funds, professors, nor students.” It was a good Providence by which Dr. 
Moses Waddell was brought from the shades of his famous Abbeville Academy, in 
South Carolina, to the succor of the expiring college. He raised it from its bed of 
languishing so that during his presidency of ten years new professors were called, 
and, by the aid of a lottery, the library and the stock of apparatus were enlarged. 
On the retirement of Dr. Waddell, New England was again called on for a president, 
in the person of Rev. Alonzo Church, of Vermont. To replace a building destroyed 
by fire in 1830, the State came again to the aid of the university in an extra annual 
gift of $6,000, continued for ten years. 
This donation was regarded asa late reimbursement by the State of the $50,000 
retained from the purchase money of the original landed property of the institution. 
These several appropriations, $25,000 in gifts and real estate; the. yearly income of 
the $100,000 funded from the proceeds of the original donations of lands, and the 
$60,000 contributed between 1830 and 1840, make up the entire contribution of Georgia 
toits university through all the years from 1802 to 1875. The largest addition of build- 
ings was made between 1830 and 1840. During these years the institution retained 
its original name, “Franklin College.” Dr. Church held the place of president of 
the university for thirty years, retiring in 1859. Since that time the institution has 
expanded through private gifts and the establishment of its several branches, the 
Agricultural and Mechanical College at Athens, School of Technology in Atlanta, 
and the Industrial College for Colored Youth at Savannah. 
Meanwhile, in 1788, the State continued its policy of the endowment of academies 
by grants to Sunbury and Savannah in Liberty and Chatham connties. We have 
already told the interesting story of the famous New England colony in Liberty 
County and the Sunbury Academy. The Chatham Academy in Savannah now occu- 
pies the same place as the original school in Augusta; it is at the head of the public- 
school system of that beautiful and prosperous city. The original grant of 1,000 
acres of wild lands for every county was supplemented in 1802 and 1810 by a provi- 
sion that confiscated property should be turned over to these schools—a just though 
small recompense for the mischief and misery inflicted on the people of Georgia by 
the Tory party of the Revolution. At the opening of the present century some half 
a dozen of these free schools had been established in as many counties of this State. 
When we-remember that the whole population of Georgia at this period was less 
than 90,000, perhaps not two-thirds white, and the white school population not 
exceeding 10,000, we can look with respect on the early efforts of this enterprising 
Commonwealth to raise, on the boundless wilderness of its immense territory, these 
little fortresses of the secondary and higher education. 
But Georgia fell into the same mistaken policy as all the original States beyond 
and south of the Hudson River, in following the British habit of endowing and sub- 
sidizing that department of the public school from which the masses of her people 
could derive the least advantage. In the third constitution of the State, 1798, 
appears the following provision, already quoted: “The arts and sciences shall be 
promoted in one or more seminaries of learning, and the legislature shall, as soon as 
ED 96 10*   
 
-P-A-G-E-374
  298 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96, 
conveniently may be, give such further donations and privileges to those already 
established as may be necessary to secure the enlargement of these institutions; and 
itshall be the duty of the general assembly, at the next session, to provide effectual 
means for the improvement and permanent security of the funds and endowments of 
such institutions.” This provision, of course, was made in view of the fact that the 
University of Georgia included a school system for the whole white people of the 
State. It has been well said that had theso original provisions been carried out, 
“Georgia would have had a system of education equal if not superior to that of any 
State in the Union.” But at first the State moved exclusively in the establishment 
of tho county academies, and by 1829 had chartered 64, and by 1840, 176 of these 
schools of every kind, with an attendance of 8,000 pupils. But these schools, in 
a society even so comparatively democratic as Georgia, ultimately fell into the hands 
of the well-to-do dominant class, and were declared by a late competent authority, 
“inaccessible to the overwhelming majority of the people of the State.” They were 
all tuition schools, in addition to the expense of board and transportation bills, and 
were founded and worked rather as classical and high schools than on common 
- school lines, from the beginning. They became justly the pride of the people of the 
State; the favorite schools in which all families that could afford the cost were desir- 
ous of educating their children. For more than thirty years from the time of their 
first ondowment, or until 1817, they, with the Franklin College, absorbed and, from 
1817 to 1836, divided extensively with the ‘‘ poor schools” the educational resources 
of the State. But in 1840 these 176 seminaries contained but 8,000 pupils, while the 
white school children of the State numbered 85,000. During these years not less 
than $200,000 had been granted to this class of seminaries. 
In 1817 an upward movement from below brought into operation the system of 
“‘noor schools,” or rather appropriations for the free education of poor children. 
Under this system the State languished in the most vital interest of its educational 
life for more than half a century, until the present system of common schools was 
established in 1870. Under this system the interest of $250,000, in 1817, and in 1821 of. 
another $250,000, with some additional endowments, was appropriated to the project 
of teaching indigent children, each for three years. Thus, for fifty years and more, 
was the stigma of ‘‘pauper schools” applied to the most central and vital institution 
of the Republic. 
In 1836 the great educational revival of the nation, in its progress toward the Gulf, 
struck the ‘Empire State of the South.” The sum of $350,000 from the surplus rey- 
enue was set apart as ‘a permanent free-school and educational fund,” and a “plan 
of common-school education” was digested by a joint committee of the legislature, 
which, in 1837, established a general system of common schools, to take effect in 1839. 
By this act the academic and free-school funds were consolidated and the old status 
revived. But in 1840 came the reaction, and the State appropriations for education 
were merged in the free-school fund, and thereafter every pupil outside the Frank- 
lin College, though enjoying the exclusive title of the university and receiving aid 
from the State, was burdened with the badge of pauperism. 
By this time—the close of the first half century of the Republic—the mind of the 
leading class in Georgia had so fallen away from the ideal of the fathers that there 
seemed to be no more intention left of educating the mass of the children at public 
expense. Under the conditions then existing the State was afflicted with a malady 
of white illiteracy. The ‘‘ poor people” rejected. with contempt the pittance doled out 
totheirchildren. In 1845 only 53 of the 93 counties applied for their share of the fund. 
From 1817 to 1860 an annual distribution of $30,000 was the extent of the contribu- 
tion of the State to the education of the people, in all $1,290,000. With the addition 
of the $8,700,000 appropriated since 1870, the State, during seventy-two years, 
expended $10,000,000. During the years from 1817 to 1845, the school population of 
the State was 20,000, 30,000, and 50,000 for the successive decades.

EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 299 
From this point of view, we can well understand the criticism of the common 
school public so freely made by President W. A. Candler, of Emory College, that up 
to the present time considerably more than $1,000,000 has been applied by the State to 
the higher education, while up to 1870 the mass of the children had been put off 
with a sum not larger. Meanwhile it is stated that no alumnus of the University of 
Georgia has given it an endowment, and no one has been elected to its presidency. 
Tn 1838"Mercer College was established at Macon by the Baptist, in 1835 Oglethorpe 
University by the Presbyterian, and in 1836 Emory College by the Methodist denom- 
ination. These, with other similar institutions founded previous to 1840, have 
now become important features in the educational life of the Stato, but their chief 
importance has been realized subsequent to the date assigned to this essay. 
‘Of course along with this record of the common school we must carry in mind the 
work of a corresponding system of private and local schools. Indeed, under the 
“poor school,” and too much under a loose construction of the commor-school law, 
at present the private and academic schools have been utilized to a large extent by 
their subsidizing for common-school work. Georgia is probably the only State in 
the Union to-day which subsidizes all varieties of private and denominational schools. 
FLORIDA. 
With the educational record of the State of Georgia, the story of the beginnings 
of the American common school from the establishment of the Union to the decade 
1830-1840 practically comes to a close. The vast territory of Florida, 367,820 square 
miles in extent, was purchased of Spain in 1819 for $5,000,000, The portion of this 
purchase included in the present State of Florida, 58,680 square miles, settled in 
1565, had been for two hundred and fifty years a land of contention between France, 
Spain, and England, each making little headway. Until the beginning of the 
present century there is no record of educational activity even in Alabama, and 
probably all schooling was in the hands of the Catholic clergy, as the resident popu- 
lation was largely of this denomination. In 1831 amovement came up at Tallahassee 
which, under the title, ‘‘The Florida Education Society,” proposed an extended 
investigation preliminary to an attempt at the establishment of a system of general 
instruction, and the governor of the Territory was requested to appoint three com- 
missioners in the interest of this inquiry. About the same time the manual-labor 
“boom” seems to have struck Tallahassee. The educational commission reported 
“an alarming neglect of education in the Territory,” and that the general indifference 
and sparseness of the population were unfavorable to any general system of pop- 
ular instruction. Both these attempts seem to have been spasmodic and without 
special result. 
The first movement of the Territorial government for the preservation of the 
school lands assigned to the Territory was made in 1835. In 1839 three school trus- 
tees were ordered to be chosen in each district and intrusted with the duty of organ- 
izing and supervising schools. In 1843 this duty was transferred to the sheriffs of 
the counties. The act of 1839, amended in 1840, 1844, and 1845, like the present 
school law of Texas, directed the judge of probate of each county to officiate as 
superintendent of schools, with the additional duty of reporting to the central 
State authorities. But it is doubtful if any considerable success attended the efforts 
to establish education in a Territory so peculiarly constituted and distracted by obsti- 
nate differences of population before 1845, when Florida was admitted as a State of 
the Union with 58,680 inhabitants, including its slave contingent. At first the 
attempt was made to leave the common-school lands to the management of the dif- 
ferent localities, but as only one township organized under that act the State assumed 
the responsibility of establishing a common-school fund from their sale.

ALABAMA, 
The present State of Alabama was first settled by the French, at Mobile, in 1702. 
For a hundred years later all outside the coast was a wilderness overrun by Indians. 
The only educational record is the repeated applications of Bienville, the French 
governor of the province of Louisiana, to the home government for ‘‘a lege,” 
which was refused by the Jesuit fraternity, who at this time were at the head of such 
affairs in the vast undefined region of the New World. The population of the colony 
did not exceed 300, 
In 1763 the territory known as West Florida passed under the control of the Brit- 
ish, and in 1783 was transferred to the Spanish. But nothing seemed to have been 
initiated in education, and beyond the usual activity of superior families, chiefly 
under the direction of the clergy, there appears to have been nothing of interest in 
this direction till the year 1800. 
The Mississippi Territory, including the present States of Alabama and Mississippi, 
by 1810 had established three counties within the limits of the present Alabama, 
which had a white population of 3,481. One John Pierce appears in history as the 
first schoolmaster of the Territory. From 1810 to 1814 two academies were chartered 
and $1,000 appropriated by the legislature of the Mississippi Territory for their sup- 
port. The latter, Green Academy, at Huntsville, Ala., is chiefly interesting to us from 
the fact that it was the real beginning of the present public-school system of the 
State, supported as an academy for fifty boys, and is now a part of the common- 
school system of Huntsville. In 1817 the Territory of Alabama was formed, and the 
State was admitted to the Union in 1819, with a population of 127,000, Previous to 
this, Congress had appointed a survey of the Territory, the Indian title to which had 
been extinguished in 1813-14, including the setting apart of the sixteenth section of 
each township and the one, afterwards increased to two, townships of land, for com- 
mon schools and a ‘‘seminary of learning.” In 1855, when the State first moved for 
the establishment of a common-school system, it was found that the sales of these 
Jands had placed in the treasury of the State the sum of $1,244,794, the interest of 
which, with the addition of the surplus revenue, direct appropriations by the State, 
and other receipts, amounted to $237,515, and the number of children of school age 
to 145,550. 
Previous to 1826 no attempt was made at a system of public schools in the State. 
In that year the city of Mobile began, in the manner by which such movements were 
inaugurated in the days before the civil war, by the appointment of a board of com- 
missioners, to whom was given full power for the complete education of the white 
children and youth of the city, already an important Gulf post. In 1830 a valuable 
plot of land was obtained, and an institution of learning, Barton Academy, was estab- 
lished. But for twenty-five years, until 1852, the history of this seminary appears to 
center on a perpetual strife concerning its organization and administration. It was 
finally merged into a close corporation, and the schools of Mobile were at a later date 
set apart from the general charge of the State in a condition of virtual independence. 
Up to this date the commissioners had fallen into the habit of subsidizing the vari- 
ous parochial and private schools of the city and county, with no attempt to support 
a proper system of public instruction, “The history of the common school in the 
State really begins in 1855, when the legislature, moved by a revival of interest in 
the chief city, embarked on the enterprise of giving to Alabama for the next twenty 
years such facilities as were required in that direction. 
The framers of the first constitution of Alabama, in 1819, struck a high note of 
prophecy in the article relating to the obligation of an American State to educate 
its children and youth. Says this document: ‘Schools and the means of education 
shall be forever encouraged in this State, and the general assembly shall take meas- 
ures to preserve from unnecessary waste and damage such lands as are or hereafter 
may be granted by the United States for the use of schools within each township in
-P-A-G-E-377
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 301 
this State, and apply the funds which may be raised from such lands in strict con- 
formity to the object of such grant. The general assembly shall take like measures 
for the improvement of such lands as have been or may be hereafter granted by the 
United States to this State for the support of a seminary of learning, and the moneys 
which may be raised from such lands by rent, lease, or sale, or from any other quar- 
ter for the purpose aforesaid, shall be and remain a fund for the exclusive support of 
a State university, for the promotion of the arts, literature, and the sciences; and 
it shall be the duty of the general assembly, as early as may be, to provide effectual 
means for the improvement and permanent security of the funds and endowment of 
such institution.” 
We have already seen how long delayed was the fulfillment of this noble, prophetic 
utterance as far as it concerned the most important department of education—the 
elementary free common schooling of the children. But, in accordance with the 
prevailing idea of the day, that education must be first organized on the summit of 
the university that it may descend to the lowlands of common instruction, the legis- 
Jature at once. moved in the good work of establishing an institution of the higher 
culture. At the first session of the legislature after the organization of the State 
government, in response to the summons of Governor Bibb, he was authorized by 
the general assembly to appoint commissioners in every county in which there 
were lands set apart for ‘‘the Seminary of Learning,” to lease the same till 1821, 
The two townships reserved for the university had wisely been located in tracts 
instead of in one block of real estate. Two years later the governor with twelve 
trustees, two from each judicial district, to be elected by the generalassembly, were 
constituted ‘‘ trustees of the University of Alabama,” and were required to report at 
the next session concerning the proper site, to be determined by the joint vote of the 
two houses. It is unnecessary to detail the various arrangements for the sale or lease 
of the university lands or of the investment of the funds. Suffice to say that to the 
very liberal provision to lessees of lands for ninety-nine years is attributed the finan- 
cial disaster that afterwards overwhelmed the institution. 
But at first all went well. Fifty thousand dollars was appropriated for buildings, 
The State increased rapidly in population, nearly doubling in the eight years from 
its admission to the Union. The raising of cotton became the leading industry. 
Negro slaves were multiplied, one-third the inhabitants of the State in 1820 being 
colored, and the annual exports of Mobile were more than 25,000 bales of cotton. 
Lands were sold at high prices, and the State appropriated the avails as the capital of 
its new system of banking with interest at 6 percent. The city of Tuscaloosa in 
1827 was chosen as the seat of the university, and the sale of city lots proved favor- 
able to the enterprise. In 1830, Rev. Philip Lindsley, president of the University 
of Nashville, having declined the presidency, the position was filled by the choice of 
Rey. Dr. Woods, president of Transylvania University, in Kentucky. Both these 
men were from the North. Dr. Lindsley was from New Jersey, Dr. Woods from 
Vermont, a graduate of Harvard and a classmate of George Bancroft, Caleb Cushing, 
and the distinguished educator, George B. Emerson. After graduating he spent two 
sin study abroad, was afterwards elected professor of mathematics in Brown 
University, Rhode Island, and was called to Transylvania University, Kentucky, on 
the retirement of Horace Holley in 1828. On the 12th of April, 1831, Dr. Woods 
was solemnly inaugurated, and the university opened with the president, 3 pro- 
fessors, 1 tutor, and 94 students. 
Here first appears one of the most remarkable characters in the educational his- 
tory of Alabama, Henry Tutwiler. A Virginian by birth, and one of the earliest grad- 
uates of the new University of Virginia; a friend of Thomas Jefferson and classmate 
of Robert T. Hunter and other famous men; improved by years of travel and acquaint- 
ance with distinguished scholars abroad—at the age of 24 he entered the State Uni- 
versity of Alabama as professor of mathematics, where he remained for seven years. 
He became subsequently master of the famous Green Spring Academy, where for    
   yea

thirty years he was recognized at home and abroad as one of the foremost educators 
of the country. The family name still remains among the excellent women of Ala- 
bama in the person of Miss Julia Tutwiler, principal of the State Normal School at 
Livingston, and widely known as one of the most devoted and cultivated of the 
teaching sisterhood of the Union. 
The university was established at first in ample buildings, the professors being dom- 
iciled in houses on the college grounds. Two additional professorships were estab- 
lished in the two following years. The incumbent of one, Mr. Henry W. Hilliard, 
was known afterwards as one of the most distinguished men of his State in publie 
affairs, his official lifo closing as minister to Brazil in 1877-1881. At the first 
commencement one student was graduated. 
But with all of this commendable zeal for the scholarly outfit of the university, one 
functionary had unhappily been neglected—a competent bookkeeper and penman to 
manage and keep the record of the material interests of the institution, The result 
was that within five years of its establishment the university found itself on the 
verge of bankruptcy and the fund depended on for its support in peril of collapse. 
It required the labor of two years by an expert accountant and agent to unravel the 
tangle into which the, affairs of the school had been involved from tho ignorance or 
carelessness of its bookkeeping, and it was fortunate that the State escaped with 
the loss of only a portion of its university fund. Through tiis great trial Dr. 
Woods held on for six years, till 1837, when he retired and returned to Rhode Island, 
where he spent the remainder of his life. 
Besides the financial trouble, the university was vexed by an extraordinary state 
of insubordination among the students, attributed to their extreme youth and lack 
of preparation for college studies. This disturbance culminated in the rebellion of 
the senior class in 1837, which involved the expulsion of the whole number. So 
discouraging were these early years that when Rey. Basil Manly assumed the presi- 
dency, as successor to Dr. Woods, in 1837, he was met by only 38 students, the high- 
est previous attendance having been 158. But the new president held on for eighteen 
years, until 1855, and steadily built up the university in every way. 
Up to the limit of this period, 1840, the record of Alabama in the public support of 
education has little more to show. Its institutions of charity, some of which have 
been widely known, were all organized at a later date, as was the medical school 
of the university and the Agricultural and Mechanical College at Auburn, under 
the presidency of Dr. Broun, now one of the best in the South. The various institu- 
tions bearing the name of ‘ college” established by the different religious bodies, 
Baptist, Methodist, and Catholic, and the numerous private and denominational 
schools, some of them of national reputation, all belong to a later period, although 
some of them had their small beginnings in the decade from 1830 to 1840. But in 
the brief space of twenty years the State had displayed 9 spirit and set in motion 
an arrangement of the secondary and higher education prophetic of good things for 
the years to come. 
MISSISSIPPI. 
The story of the American common school in Mississippi does not begin during 
the time limit appropriated to this essay, the first half century of the Republic, 
1790-1840. Indeed, until the beginning of the present century, there is, for this 
State, no story of education of any type connected with schools to be told. Settled 
by the French as early as 1699 on the shore of the great river, passing under the con- 
trol of the British Empire for the brief pericd of twenty years, 1763-1783, then fall- 
ing under the dominion of the Spanish power, which reigned supreme on the western 
coast of the Mississippi River from the Gulf to the summit of the Rocky Mountains 
and the southern boundary of British Canada, finally becoming a portion of the 
territory of the United States near the opening of the nineteenth century, there 
was little opportunity for the development of anything like education outside the

family and such instruction of children and youth as always accompanies the min- 
istry of a priesthood so zealous as that of the Catholic Church. 
But here, as in the early records of the Northwest, wo find the local historians 
reveling in the vision of an ideal social state, in their glowing descriptions of the 
first Anglo-Saxon settlements in this territory. Up to the year of British possession 
the country had been occupied chiefly at a few military posts on the Gulf, at Biloxi, 
and at Natchez, on the river, with small prospect of permanent occupation by the 
group of wandering adventurers from France, who scoured the country in. pursuit 
of imaginary gold fields or an clusive earthly paradise. But with the approach of 
the war of Independence there came hither a considerable immigration of people 
from New Jersey, Connecticut, and elsewhere, flecing to the far-off wilderness to 
escape the perils of the impending revolt of the thirteen colonies. Tho carly exodus 
of the British forces from New England, carrying with them a body of sympathizers 
with the mother country to the northeastern provinces of Canada, had placed these 
colonies in a state of assurance concerning the final issue of the conflict that was 
not shared by the middle provinces, which thenceforth bore the brunt of the war, 
while the South, below Virginia,-virtually until the closing period of the strife, was 
overrun and demoralized by the enemy. 
It is not always clearly taught in the school histories of the United States that 
Florida never ‘‘rebelled”’ against the mother country, and during the entire period 
of the Revolutionary struggle, especially in its western section, was a refuge for the 
disaffected class in all the Atlantic colonies. The New Jersey Company, under the 
lead of the Swayze Brothers, was granted 19,000 acres of land in Adams County, on 
the shore of the Mississippi, in 1772. Later came Phineas Lyman, bringing along a 
crowd of Connecticut Yankees, who were established on a big estate of 20,000 acres in 
Chickasaw County, not faraway. Rev. Jedediah Smith, father of ten children, was 
the first Protestant clergyman to invade this primitive Catholic reserve. In the glow- 
ing record of the historians of early Mississippi, these people came to cultivate the soil, 
brought intelligence and capital, raised indigo, tobacco, and, later, cotton for export, 
reveled in a rural paradise of meats, vegetables, fruits, ‘‘ milk and wild honey,” and 
made everything athome. Although too far away from Pensacola, the British seat of 
government, to be affected by the laws, these people ‘‘ were a law unto themselves,” 
paid their debts, dwelt in peace, and by sheer force of personal character and public 
opinion kept down the evil-disposed folk that inevitably drifted in. Natchez was 
the only effort at a village, being a settlement of twenty log houses, under a great 
bluff on the river bank, with four stone buildings. They were undisturbed during 
the war, but in 1779 Spain, lying alongside, at war with England abroad, conquered 
the settlement and established its domain over a territory larger than the old 
republic east of the Alleghanies. But there seems to have been no interference 
with the original settlers, even their religion being tolerated, as certainly the 
Catholic faith would not have been in the old eastern English provinces from which 
they came. 
In 1795 the boundaries of the United States territory at the south were drawn 
along the northern lino of Florida, and this portion of the State of Georgia, extend- 
ing to the Mississippi River, including the three States of Georgia, Alabama, and 
Mississippi, then came under the control of the new Republic. But even before this, 
the great expectations from the opening of the vast Southwest, even to the mouths of 
the Mississippi, had set in motion another tide of emigration. This body of people 
came to the southern boundary of the Republic on the eastern shore of the Pearl River. 
They settled in the pine woods, reared great herds of cattle, and built up a commu- 
nity that, in contrast to the original emigration to Mississippi, was a semiciviliza- 
tion. The natural antagonisms between them and the better sort previously men- 
tioned, laid the foundations of the bitter local jealousies and feuds that, for half a 
century, hindered the progress of all good things in Mississippi. In 1798 the Terri- 
tory was organized, and Winthrop Sargeant, of Massachusetts, was sent down by the

  304 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Government to drive the “ wild team” that Mississippi undoubtedly was under cir- 
cumstances so peculiar. Of course he failed, and not till Clairborne was appointed 
governor, in 1801, was the first Territorial legislature convened at Natchez and the 
new Territory really set on its feet. 
Nobody claims that up to this date there had been any public movement for the 
schooling of any class during the hundred years of French, British, and Spanish oceu- 
pation. Of course the original settlers from the Northeast, in their characteristic 
extempore home way, did not let their children “ grow up in so great barbarism” as 
to be wholly ignorant of letters and unable to ‘‘read- the word of God.” To this first 
deputation of solid Anglo-American folk is Mississippi indebted for a good deal of 
the remarkable ability and intelligence that in its early history towered above its 
natural surroundings.. Although it is on record that there was but one printer and 
no newspaper in the colony, and although copies of the first laws of the legislature 
were made in writing, yet during his short administration, in 1799, Governor 
Sargeant forwarded a petition of the people in Natchez for ‘‘a seminary ” and a min- 
ister of the gospel. The trials of Parson Jedediah Smith in preaching his gospel of 
~ Protestantism are a matter of local history. But*the youth of Mississippi did not 
incline to that profession, and in 1826 it was declared that, up to that date, no native 
of the State had become a Protestant clergyman. 
In 1802 the capital of the Territory was located at Washington, a village 6 miles 
inland from Natchez. This little metropolis in the wilderness at once became the 
center of all the society and culture, of which there seems to have been a good supply 
in the Territory. Buildings were erected, a village grew up, and again we are treated 
to a brilliant picture of the social life of the place, including ‘‘wine parties and 
duels.” The Territory included the present States of Alabama and Mississippi, still 
chiefly in possession of the Indian tribes and settled only in isolated localities ina 
boundless wilderness. In 1803 the vast territory of Louisiana, including the city of 
New Orleans and the mouths of the Mississippi River, fell into possession of the 
United States. But the central and northern portion of the territory and State of 
Mississippi were occupied by the Indian tribes until, in 1832, their final exit was 
accomplished. Previous to this, Gen. Andrew Jackson had carved out a military 
road from Florida on the Gulf to Tennessee, and along this highway poured in a new 
emigration, less desirable in some way than the original body of excellent people 
that “held the fort” at Natchez and on the shore of the mighty river. In 1817 Mis- 
sissippi was admitted to the Union and in 1820 its population was 75,000. 
In 1813 the first effort of the people clustering about the Natchez district culmi- 
nated in the establishment of the school which became Jefferson College, the practical 
beginning of the superior education in the new State founded at Washington. It 
struggled through a varied career of success and discouragement for fifty years, till 
it declined with the rural metropolis in which it was located. Washington is now 
only a hamlet in a remote suburb of the city on the bluffs and preserves the remains 
of the oldseminary as a village academy. The Congress of the United States made 
a donation of lands, first in Alabama, afterwards in Mississippi, in its favor. But 
misfortune after misfortune blocked its success, first in a short experience as a mili- 
tary.school, and it was never practically more than an academy. ‘‘In its history of 
ninety years it has never granted an academic degree.” Yet, like so many of the little 
seats of education in the new American life, there clusters about it a notable group of 
students and teachers, One of these instructors was Sir William Dunbar, a remark- 
able Scotchman, of noble lineage, who, for some unexplained reason, drifted to the 
shores of the Mississippi at this time, pursued his scientific studies on his plantation, 
became a member of the learned societies of Europe, and the friend and correspond- 
ent of Jefferson till his death in 1810. The great American naturalist, Audubon, 
was for two*years teacher of drawing in this little seat of learning, where his sons 
wereschooled. Governor A. G. Brown, the father of popular education in Mississippi, 
Jefferson Davis, with others only less distinguished, were also among its students,
-P-A-G-E-381
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 805 
From the earliest period the upper strata of the Mississippi people persisted in 
sending their children to the North or to Europe for education. Even as late as 
1840 the governor of the State protested against the habit and urged the growing 
hostility of the North to slavery as a reason why the people should build up an 
effective educational system for their own State. For the thirty years succeeding 
the admission of the State to the Union, Mississippi had nothing that could be called 
a common-school system. During the early years of the country the educational 
situation is described as “ deplorable” by reliable native historians. ‘‘ Schoolmasters 
were difficult to be obtained and generally vicious or ignorant.” A settlement of 
Methodist people, in Warren County, was a positive addition to the educational side 
of the Territory. The charter of Jefferson College, in 1802, was ‘‘the first act of 
incorporation in Mississippi.” After great vicissitudes, im 1840 it supported a full 
college course with a president and four professors and 1,500 volumes in its library. 
The first seminary for girls was established in Natchez in 1801 by Rev. Mr. Ker, an 
Irish clergyman, afterwards lawyer and judge. It was taught by his wife and 
daughters. In 1818 was set up at Washington the Elizabeth Female Academy, ‘‘the 
first fruits of Protestant denominational influence in all the extreme South.” 
Founded by and named from a devoted woman of the Methodist order, Mrs. Eliza- 
beth Roach, it secured for its principal Mrs. Caroline M. Thayer, a granddaughter 
or grandniece of Gen, Joseph Warren, who fell at the battle of Bunker Hill. This 
excellent lady, who afterwards removed to another school in the State, isremembered 
as an educational ‘‘ Mother in Israel” by the grateful daughters of Mississippi, than 
whom there is no more zealous and farseeing body of school women in the entire 
South to-day. Its commencement exercises in 1829 are said to have been the first in 
The average attendance during the first ten years was from ten to fifty 
pupils. It was abandoned with the decay of the village of Washington in 1843. 
The earliest division of the sixteenth section of Government school lands in Missis- 
sippi was made at the present city of Columbus, in the northeastern part of the State, 
in 1821, by the establishment of anacademy. Its patrimony included a portion of the 
present flourishing little city; the lease, being drawn for ninety-nine years, secured 
afair income. Through all the years before the civil war this was one of the most 
noted schools in the State, maintaining a classical, to which was added an elemen- 
tary, department. At the reorganization of education in 1868 it became the public 
school of the city in connection with the colored department. To this must be 
attributed the reputation of Columbus as the proper educational center of the exten- 
sive and fertile country of northeast Mississippi and the recent establishment of the 
Women’s Normal and Industrial State College, one of the most original, character- 
istic, and useful institutions of the New South, already copied in Georgia, North 
and South Carolina, and worthy of imitation in many States of the Umon. 
In 1826 the Mississippi Academy and College were established at Clinton, Hinds 
County, 10 miles west of Vicksburg, in one of the most favorable sections of the 
river country. Mrs. Thayer was called to the principalship of the female depart- 
ment. After an unsuccessful attempt to obtain the State seminary fund, it went 
through various experiences, until in 1850 it became a Baptist institution, and is still 
one of the best schools of the higher class in the State. To this school as a professor, 
and afterwards as president, came Dr. Walter Hillman, from Massachusetts, so well 
known, with his excellent wife, as the head of the Central Female College estab- 
lished by them at Clinton. We omit here the interesting story of this school, 
inelnding the romantic episode of its continuance by common consent of the rival 
Union and Confederate authorities during the military operations around Vicks- 
burg—a little island paradise of peace and good will amid a Commonwealth involved 
in the horrors of civil war. 3 
In 1830 a distinguished divine from Pennsylvania, appealed to the Presbyterian 
people of Mississippi to establish a college at Oak Ridge, near Bruinshurg, where 
General Grant crossed the Mississippi in his final movement upon Vicksburg. He

told the people of this State that up to that date no college commencement had 
ever been held nor had a single coliege student been graduated southwest of Ten- 
nessce through tho States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and the Territory of Arkansas, 
an area of 145,000 square miles, inhabited by 200,000 people, and not one native mis- 
sionary had entered the ministry. He also declared that there was not a city or 
village in the State where he was willing to locate a college, because of the low con- 
dition of morals. Whatever of truth there may have been in his statements, the 
wealthy people of the State came to the rescue, subscribed $12,000 for the buildings, 
and gave 200 acres of land, with an endowment, to the enterprise. The plucky presi- 
dent cut down the first tree on Oak Ridge and the new school opened in 1831, with 
65 students, and held its first commencement in 1833. Twenty-five thousand-dollars 
was afterwards added for a theological professorship. This college, inaugurated 
under such favorable auspices, during its existence educated 1,000 students. Butin 
1851 its funds were lost, from bad investments, and its distinguished president mur- 
dered. After a few years of checkered success the property was sold to the State and 
transferred to the Alcorn University for colored youth. The remaining funds were 
used to establish a seminary for young women at Port Gibson, in the neighborhood. 
These were but a few of the attempts to establish academic and collegiate schools 
in the State before the movement in 1840-1850 to place on the ground a proper school 
system and State university. Among others may be mentioned the Oxford Female 
College, established 1838, still known as the Union Female College in the university 
town. Centenary College, established by the Methodists in 1839, was transferred to 
Louisiana in 1845, ‘During the twenty years from 1820 to 1840,” according to 
Governor Brown, ‘‘no less than 110 colleges and academies, male and female, had been 
inaugurated in Mississippi. Most of them had a fitful existence and then went down 
to the great receptacle of old and useless things—the tomb of the Capulets. The 
children of Mississippi were largely educated in private schools.” 
To this able and farsecing statesman, Goyernor A. G. Brown, is the State of Missis- 
sippi indebted for the first positive and persistent movement in favor of a State 
university and a system of common schools. 
The seminary lands of the State were first located in Alabama, afterwards in Missis- 
sippi. In 1821 the legislature was moved to locate these lands. In 1830-1833 the Plan- 
ters’ Bank was established, the State owning half its stock, and being represented 
by six of thirteen directors. In 1833 the university lands were sold for $277,000. 
The dismal story of the subsequent failure of the bank, including a loss of $200,000 
of this fund, with the long struggle of the university, nominally organized in 1841, 
to get on its feet and into a proper working condition for the next twenty years, need 
not be told in detail. It is the old story of the futile attempt, in so many of our 
new States, to establish a university on the basis of the United States land grant, 
the neglect or perversion and loss of a large part of the funds, and the final rally of 
the people, often against the determined opposition of the denominational and other 
adverse influences, to place the State system on its feet. To-day, spite of all hostile 
influences or early failures, the public support of the higher education, both in its 
academic and industrial departments, is as well assured as any policy of the Republic. 
In Mississippi, as in Georgia, the complete success was imperiled by an unwise 
division of the funds, Governor Brown favored a central university and auxiliary 
academies. The bitter contentions that raged around the cradle of the university 
were settled in 1845 by the location at Oxford, and funds at last were gathered for 
its opening prior to 1850. But this, with the history of the institution after the 
close of the civil war, the subseqnent establishment of the Agricultural and Mechan- 
ical College, and of the Woman’s Normal and Industrial College, will properly come 
under consideration at a future time. 
It was not till the same time, 1845, and under the powerful leadership of the great 
educational governor of the State, Hon. A. G. Brown, that the first movement 
toward a common-school instruction for the white children and youth of Mississippi     
 
-P-A-G-E-383
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 307 
was inaugurated. By the help of Judge J. S. B. Thatcher, a native of Massachusetts 
and a graduate of Harvard College, a plan was devised and a system of education 
launched upon the tide of unsuccessful experiment. The first common-school law of 
Mississippi did not essentially differ from those of other Southern States already 
described. The State had already placed in its constitution ihe inspiring words of 
the immortal ordinance of 1787: ‘‘ Religion, morality, and knowledge being neces- 
sary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means 
of education shall be forever encouraged.” ‘The statute provided that the county 
courts should appoint school commissioners, five in each county, who should take in 
charge the entire business of the establishment of a system of popular education 
and impose a tax which, with the approval of the people concerned, would set the 
great machine in motion. But all was predicated on the very uncertain hope that 
the majority of the voters would consent to accept the system and_pay for the school- 
ing of all the children. It was just that which the majority of the voters never 
decided to do until 1868. But during the fifteen years before the breaking out of 
the great conflict the legislature was vexed by the persistent efforts of the enemies 
of the system to repeal the law. As it was, only a few of the counties would accept 
it. By 1860 the original intent of the law had been evaded and modified by an end- 
less series of enactments for the benefit of separate localities. The partial collapse 
of the law of 1845 was a new demonstration of the folly of relying on ‘local option” 
as the base of any system of public education among a people of such diverse origin 
in a State torn by such fierce local jealousies as any of our Southwestern Common- 
wealths previous to 1840. But a great deal was undoubtedly done in this way for 
the education of the people into a growing determination to school the children. 
The speedy and inevitable decision of all these Commonwealths, even under the 
most discouraging circumstances, at the close of the war to adopt the complete plan 
ofthe American common school for all classes and both races was the final result of 
the long and unsatisfactory experimenting of the half century before the great flood 
of 1861. 
Meanwhile the state of education, as it existed during the later years of this 
period, receives an illuminating side light from a letter written in 1847 by Rev. Mr. 
Morey, of Mount Sylvan Academy, on the prospect of Northern teachers coming to 
Mississippi. With a detailed description of the peculiarities of the country and the 
qualifications of the emigrating pedagogue, especially if a woman, he states that 
two hundred good teachers could find immediate and profitable employment in the 
State. But he premises, especially to the male sex, ‘‘ Come determined to teach; not 
to speculate or marry; our places for golden investments are all occupied and our 
heiresses all engaged. Not to farm it or to preach. We know how to raise cotton 
better than you could, and we have a fair supply of preachers. Not to become 
politicians or lecturers on phrenology ; the science of government is wonderfully well 
known here and phrenology isnot popular. Inshort, we need teachers, not peddlers, 
or doctors, or lawyers, or literary pretenders.” 
In 1840 the census of the United States reports in Mississippi 7 colleges, containing 
454 students ; 71 academies, with 2,553 pupils ; 382 primary schools; 107 pupils educated 
at public expense, and 8,360 white illiterates. 
  LOUISIANA. 
If tho generations could be educated by proclamation, and if the statute law 
could establish and support ‘‘seminaries of learning,” the State of Louisiana, instead 
’ of being one of the most illiterate, would to-day be at the head of educational eminence 
among the States of the Republic. In reading its body of legislation from the be- 
ginning of the century to 1860, connected with the early hope of educating the 
masses, the reader is impressed at once with the eloquent elaboration of the state- 
ment and the inefficiency of the administrative methods in providing effective 
means for the enforcement of the law. Up to the year 1803, when the vast territory 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
  308 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
of Louisiana, including the present State, passed under the control of the Goy- 
ernment of the United States, the educational affairs of the colony were in the 
hands of the Catholic priesthood, who favored a system of parochial instruction. 
There is an interesting record of faithful and self-sacrificing labors by the devoted 
members of the female, Jesuit, and other religious orders in this direction, that only 
indirectly concerns our present subject. In 1741 Governor Bienville petitioned the 
home government for a “college,” but was put off with a slur upon the insignificance 
of the colony. The expulsion of the Jesuits and the confiscation of their property 
of $180,000, perhaps the largest sum of corporate wealth then in that country, in 1764, 
was doubtless a backset to such arrangements as were then on the ground. 
But as soon as the Territory of New Orleans was organized, the attention of the 
Territorial legislature was called to the entire subject of the education of the chil- 
dren and youth. Between 1805 and 1810 a general system of schooling was enacted 
which, had it been workable under the circumstances, would have launched this 
beautiful province on a career of intelligence and prosperity unparalleled in the 
Southwest. A board of “regents of the University of Orleans” was established, 
consisting of the governor, judges of the supreme court and United States court, 
mayor and recorder of New Orleans, and president of the legislative council, ex 
officio, and twenty eminent citizens, appointed by the legislature, of whom it might 
almost be said, as of Lord Bacon, that ‘they had taken all knowledge for their 
province.” They were empowered, by successive laws, to establish ‘‘ A College of 
Orleans,” with president and four professors in the city of New Orleans and one or 
more academies in each parish or county. In their ideas of the edueation of women, 
no legislative body of the day was abreast with that of Louisiana. They say: 
“Whereas the prosperity of every State depends on the education of the female sex, 
in so much that the dignity of their condition is the strongest characteristic which 
distinguishes civilized from savage society,” and they authorize the regents of the 
university to establish as many academies for their education as may be considered 
fit. The same body was instructed to set up a public library in each parish. In 
1808 the judge of each parish was instructed to appoint a “jury” of twelve to 
twenty-four persons to establish such educational arrangements ‘‘as should appear 
to them most convenient.” Five trustees were to be appointed to administer the 
system. 
Here was a scheme of education so broad and admirable that one is interested to 
learn the names of its framers. They were certainly not behind, if not actually in 
advance of, any similar group of educators in the country, not excepting Jefferson 
and his noble bodyguard in Virginia. But when we come to the executive side of 
the plan our admiration falls into a swift collapse.. The educable children and 
youth of the Territory could not have exceeded a few thousand, as half the population 
was composed of negro slaves, These were scattered over a realm of 48,720 square 
miles, which, with its native fertility and resources, was perhaps the most difficult 
of subjugation by man of any inhabited portion of the Republic. The majority of 
the white people were still Catholic, and could not be brought into cooperation with 
any scheme of education outside the priestly programme of the ecclesiastical parochia] 
schools. There was yet no such accumulation of property as would justify the set- 
ting up of a State school system so expensive. To meet the original outlay the law 
proposed a lottery scheme of $50,000 for the college and academies, and a public tax, 
in addition to the meager sum that could be realized from the sale of the Government 
school lands, with the proviso that all persons who objected should be excused from 
the imposition of the school levy. 
Of course, with these two provisions the realization of this educational ideal in the 
Louisiana Territory was only among the possibilities of a millennium. The result 
followed swiftly on the heels of the endeavor. In 1809 Governor Claiborne sadly 
informs the fathers, ‘‘ with regret, that the act to provide the means of establishing 
public schools in the Territory is not likely to produce the desired effect. In the 
parish of Pointe Coupee provisions have been made for the support of two public
-P-A-G-E-385
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 3809 
schools; but no other parish has followed its example.” Still the good governor is 
pleased to hear that ‘‘private schools are springing up in every quarter, and fathers 
of families are interested in the education of their offspring.” 
Not till 1811 did the legislature actually lay hands on the treasury and vote $15,000 
. for the College of Orleans and $2,000 for one or more schools in each county, the 
entire appropriation amounting to $39,000. Three administrators were to be ap- 
pointed to each county, but only after the schools had been in operation three, and 
in 1813 six, months, could they profit by the public bounty. At different times 
until 1841 did the legislature work at this vain problem of ‘‘ making bricks without 
straw,” gradually increasing the bonus to each parish, arranging the school officials 
in different groups in what always seemed to be a hopeless style of educational 
“dress parade.” The outcome of all was the sustaining of the College of Orleans, 
of which the celebrated New Orleans preacher, Rev. Theodore Clapp, an importa- 
tion from New England, was a prominent official, until 1826. It never had one 
hundred students, and was finally transferred, with its funds, to a ‘ State univer- 
sity,” Jocated at Jackson, East Feliciana Parish, with the same array of notabili- 
ties as trustees and a smal! annual legislative gift for 1ts maintenance. The lottery 
method was repeatedly invoked, both for the State system and the endowment of 
the academies that sprang up like a crop of ‘' gourds in the night,” only to be 
withered by the first sunstroke of actual experience. Even in New Orleans, the 
center of population and culture, the public schooi in the second, the most progressive 
of its three manicipalities, did not contain seventy-five pupils; and these probably 
the children of the poor, whose tuition and school supplies were paid from the pub- 
lic fund. The board of regents was finally abolished, and the effort made to work 
the schools by local administrators and trustees appointed by the legislature or the 
county court. 
Tn 1825 $2.62; was appropriated to each voter in the counties for public schools, 
the minimum and maximum of the appropriation being $800 and $1,350. But so 
meager was the result of all this legislation that as high an authority as President 
William Preston Johnston of Tulane University, declares, ‘‘ there was no such thing 
as public school education in Louisiana previous to 1841. Parish schools were 
founded and small appropriations made for their support, but they were not free 
schools, and doled out the pittance of a public education to eight indigent pupils in 
each parish. {n 1841 the right and duty of supporting free schools was imposed on 
the city of New Orleans, and in 1845 a system of public schools was established by 
the constitution.” It is estimated that $2,000,000 was expended in these abortive 
attempts to educate the people of Louisiana during the first forty years of the cen- 
tury. A great number of academies were called into being by the offer of legis- 
lative aid, only to fall in pieces on a real attempt to live and do educational work. 
Tt is not necessary to impute dishonesty to thé various organizations which received 
or to the directors who handled this large sum of money, although the temptations 
of a scheme so loose were very great. But, as in South Carolina, it is probable that 
a good deal of what was appropriated was absorbed by a system of subsidizing local 
parish and private schools. The city of New Orleans even at that early period had 
received many bequests from private sources, the majority of which “‘ vanished into 
thin air,” or linger in ‘innocuous desuetude” to the present day. Well may it be 
said, in the words of the historian of Louisiana: ‘*No State has ever been more lay- 
ish in its expenditure of money for the instruction of its children and youth and the 
establishment of schools than Louisiana, but all has been a failure.” 
But we must not infer from the failure of the legislature of Louisiana during these 
forty years to put on the ground a system of public instruction that nothing was 
accomplished. The education of an American State in a matter so great and complex 
as the training of its people into American citizenship is not the work of one but of 
many generations. It was necessary that the people of all the States should Jearn 
the chronic obstacles to the upbuilding of the American common school. Even our    
 
-P-A-G-E-386
310 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
young people nowadays are not thoroughly taught, through reading and hearing, the 
commonplace arguments in fayor of universal education. The only method by which 
a great and diverse people can learn any essential truth in the policy of a republican 
government is by an experience, continued through many years, of astruggle toward 
the conviction that it is one of the elements of free institutions. The vast majority 
of the people of the State that is now doing the most for the education of its masses 
do not support this policy because of arguments yearly addressed to their understand- 
ing, but from an obstinate conviction, almost amounting to a violent prejudice, 
inwrought into the very texture of public opinion through the conflicts, defeats, and 
victories that ‘‘ blaze” the road to a final success. 
Such was the experience of the Southern common school public during the seventy- 
five years from the establishment of the national Government to the close of the 
civil war. This portion of the Southern people, always including its ablest and most 
worthy public men, and a growing element among its most reliable citizens, could 
always be trusted to advocate the educating of the whole people for a progressive 
citizenship. The whole proposition was so wrought out and the inevitable result so 
ground into the consciousness of this class that when by the fate of war the greatest 
hostile influence was forever suppressed, the common school came to the front almost 
without opposition, save from the ignorance, prejudice, and bigotry that we always 
have with us. 
It must not be inferred that, because of the failure of repeated efforts to establish 
the common school, the people of Louisiana were left in the ‘barbarism of igno- 
rance.” At every failure an obstinate public opinion appeared in the legislature to 
demand a new experiment. Every change in the laws previous to 1840 was made in 
the interest of a greater efficiency, as1f the people were turning the matter about 
by every possible way to find out the one successful method of schooling their chil- 
dren under circumstances so complex and disheartening. And although at the last, 
on the eve of the great war, not half the white children of the State were gathered into 
the schools, and illiteracy abounded in some pertions of the Commonwealth, yet, on 
the other hand, many thousand youth had learned something and were waked up by 
such opportunities as they possessed to a desire for more. The State fund was all 
the time growing, and only its misappropriation during the period of reconstruction 
prevented Louisiana from having to-day one of the large educational fands of the 
South. And no State in the Union during the first half century of the Republic 
received into itself a greater proportion of brilliant, capable, and hopeful people from 
all lands and every portion of the United States than Louisiana, Every feature of 
the history of Louisiana during her picturesque past can be easily written into a 
romance, and her cducational record has been no exception to this fact. 
One of these early histories was that of Alexander Milne, a young Scotchman 
engaged in the personal service of a nobleman im one of the northern districts of 
Scotland. Coming home from London, the master of the house is said to have 
issued an order that his men servants should all cut their hair after a fashion pre- 
vailing in certain great houses in the metropolis. ‘‘Sandy Milne cuts his hair to 
please no man,” responded the obstinate youth, who thereupon betook himself to 
the New World, never stopping till he arrived in New Orleans. There, after a suc- 
cessful business career, he found himself for that day a man of wealth, and by will 
established an institution for boys that still exists in the city. Besides this, he 
remembered his old home, and endowed a classical school, with the aid of the son of 
his old master, which has become one of the most useful institutions of learning 
in that part of Scotland. I pass over the even more interesting stories of John 
McDonough, Paul Tulane, and a score of others only less known, who from the 
earliest years of the city have bestowed generous gifts, too often neglected or 
destroyed. To-day no city in America can be trusted to guard such a benefaction 
with more jealous care than New Orleans. 
So we need not be surprised that the educational public of New Orleans became
-P-A-G-E-387
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 311 
finally disgusted with the fruitless fumbling of the honorable board of State regents 
with its educational affairs, and in 1841 dusted the ‘College of Orleans” out into 
the country and obtained a local board of education, appointed by the governor, to 
establish a central and two primary schools of a public character, partly supported 
by State funds and a local tax, with 150 poor children educated free. The great 
revival of the common school in the far Northeast had reached even to the Gulf, and 
the city fathers consulted Horace Mann and Henry Barnard, who had already become 
national authorities in matters of this sort. Mr. Mann recommended Mr. J. A. Shaw, 
of Bridgewater, Mass., as a fit person to take control of the new expériment in pub- 
lic school work. The city was divided into three municipalities, each independent 
in local affairs, Its entire population of 103,000, half colored, probably contained 
10,000 white children of proper school age. Mr. Shaw came to the second munici- 
pality as superintendent of schools, and began the work with Jess than 100 pupils. In 
a year his schools numbered more than 1,000 and in two years 2,000. The schools 
were graded and taught according to the usual methods then prevailing in the 
Northern cities, including the French and English languages. By 1844 the remain- 
ing municipalities had followed; and the city of New Orleans from that day to 
1860 had probably the best system of common schools in any Southern city, with 
some features of superiority peculiar to itself. 
In 1845 the legislature of the State, encouraged by this success, made by far the 
most vigorous and practical effort of the century to secure the training of the chil- 
dren. The following articles were incorporated in the revised constitution, which 
went into operation in 1845: 
TitLe VII—Public education. 
ARTICLE 133. There shall be appointed a superintendent of public education, who 
shall hold his office for two years. His duties shall be prescribed by law. He shall 
receive such compensation as the legislature may direct. 
Art. 134. The legislature shall establish free public schools throughout the State, 
and shall provide means for their support by taxation on property or otherwise. 
Art. 135, The proceeds of all lands heretofore granted by the United States to 
this State for the use and support of schools, and of all lands which may hereafter 
be granted or bequeathed to the State, and not expressly granted or bequeathed for 
any other purpose, which hereafter may be disposed of by the State, and the pro- 
ceeds of estates of deceased persons to which the State may become entitled by law, 
shall be held by the State as a loan, and shall be and remain a perpetual fund, on 
which the State shall pay an annual interest of 6 per cent, which interest, together 
with all the rents of the unsold lands, shall be appropriated to the support of such 
schools, and this appropriation shall remain inviolable. 5 
ArT. 136, All moneys arising from the sales which have been or may hereafter be 
made of any lands heretofore granted by the United States to this State for the use 
of a seminary of learning, and from any kind of donation that may hereafter be 
made for that purpose, shall be and remain a perpetual fund, the interest of which, 
at 6 per cent per annum, shall be appropriated to the support of a seminary of learn- 
ing for the promotion of literature and the arts and sciences, and no law shall ever 
be made diverting said fund to any other use than to the establishment and improve- 
ment of said seminary of learning. 
ART. 137. A university shall be established in the city of New Orleans. It shall 
be composed of four faculties, to wit: One of law, one of medicine, one of the natural 
sciences, and one of letters. 
Ant. 138, It shall be called the “University of Louisiana,” and the Medical Col- 
lege of Louisiana, as at present organized, shall constitute the faculty of medicine. 
Anr. 139. The legislature shall provide by law for its further organization and 
government, but shall be under no obligation to contribute to the establishment or 
support of said university by appropriations. 
The university established by this authority, as far as it had become an accom- 
plished fact, was included in the organization of Tulane University in 1890. By a 
gift from one of the excellent women of New Orleans, the widow of the former dean. 
of the Medical College, Dr. Richardson, this school is now housed in a fit building, 
ard, with the great Charity Hospital, has become one of the most eminent foundations 
of medical instruction in the country.
-P-A-G-E-388
I  __—__ 
312 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The school law of 1845, enacted in accordance with the constitutional provision, 
provided for the education of all white youth under the age of 21 by a State tax of 
1 mill on the dollar, which, wit’ the income of the State fund, was disbursed to every 
parish that decided to place itself in connection with the system. All parishes that 
chose gave up their school lands to the State fund, or held them as they would. A 
State superintendent of schools was appointed with a salary of $3,000 and $800 for 
incidental expenses, while Horace Mann began work in Massachusetts for $1,000 a 
year and paid his own clerk hire. A parish superintendent of schools was elected 
by a vote of the people, with a salary of $300. Three district trustees were also 
elected by popular vote. Alexander Dimitry was appointed State superintendent of 
education in 1847, and for several years worked with great fidelity in the new system 
of instruction. 
But no machinery, however perfect, can educate a people without its own hearty 
consent and cooperation. The American common school has been antagonized in 
Louisiana, and while it could not be overthrown, has fallen short of the proper 
results of the best efforts. In 1856 thirty parishes were attempting to school some 
12,000 pupils, at an annual expense of $142,000; or, according to another account, forty 
parishes supported 740 schools, with 7,000 pupils, at a cost of $166,000. There were 
no very reliable statistics of education, especially in the Southern States, before 
* 1860, Until 1861 the National Library at Washington had no collection of pamphlets, 
and all that concerns common school education in the way of local information in 
that vast repertory has been gathered since that comparatively recent date. In 1856 
the State superintendent of Louisiana declared that half the children in the thirty 
or forty parishes referred to were out of school. He says: ‘‘More than $2,000,000 
have been appropriated by the State in behalf of the system of schools since its 
origin. Several laws have been enacted which, making no adequate provision for 
their enforcement, have failed in great measure to attain the object hoped for. It is 
evident that here is a lamentable failure, for it appears that nearly one-half of the 
educable children in the parishes have not for the year derived any advantage from 
the system.” 
Governor Hobart declared in 1855: ‘‘The report of the superintendent of schools 
is far from showing a satisfactory condition of affairs, and the schools may be con- 
sidered almost a failure. The plan adopted at one session of the legislature is entirely 
modified at the next. It is not a system; it is the bewildering confusion of chaos.” 
It had already become evident that, whatever might be the success of the Ameri- 
can common school system in a few of the cities and large towns of the South, the 
sparse settlement and peculiar organization of society in all these States made its 
satisfactory working through the open country, where nine-tenths of the children 
lived, almost an impossibility. Alongside the public schools were the private, 
academic, parochial, and family organizations. The strong feeling of personal and 
political independence in every locality made all attempts to supervise education by 
the central government abortive. The slave class in Louisiana was a full half of 
the entire population of the State. Under conditions like these, it is not surpris- 
ing tnat the persistent efforts of the common school public of Louisiana should have 
failed to establish a system of popular instruction satisfactory to itself, and that only 
after the great obstacle to universal education had been destroyed, was this State, at 
the end, practically, of sixteen years of warfare, brought again, in 1868, to a final 
attempt to school all its children and youth. 
TENNESSEE. 
A late historian of Tennessee, Phelan, declares: ‘The history of the common 
schools is in the main the history of the public lands in Tennessee, and the history 
of the public lands in this State is the history of confusion. * * * More than 
three hundred acts have been passed upon subjects growing out of the relation 
between the public schools and the school lands of the State.” President Philip
-P-A-G-E-389
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 313 
Lindsley, of the University of Tennessee, who, from the year 1826, was beyond ques- 
tion not only the most eminent, but also the most aggressive and reliable of the edu-_ 
cators of the State, declared at different times before 1840 that up to that date ‘‘the 
State had done nothing for colleges or academies, and that, practically, no school or 
child had been aided by the State school funds.” In fact, during the period treated 
in this essay—the first half century of the Republic, 1790-1840—there was no history 
of the American common school to be told, as nothing of the sort existed in this, 
from the first and to-day, one of the most powerful and influential of the Southern 
States. 
We have already given the account of the early history of such education as was 
established in Tennessee during its brief Territorial period and early experience, as 
the third Commonwealth admitted to the new Union in 1796, with an area of 45,600 
square miles and a population of 77,000. It has already been related that the earliest 
school in the Territory, Washington College, in east Tennessee, was founded by 
Samuel Doak, under the legislative authority of North Carolina. Doak may be 
regar urded as the father of education in this State, and, with his three colaborers, 
ead, Carrick, and Balch, was a good representative of the vigorous and intel- 
gent Presbyterian clergy that we have already met as the pioneers of the superior 
schools in the Southern Atlantic States, from Virginia to Georgia. 
Within ten years, the two institutions that promised to become the leading col- 
leges of the State, Dickinson at Nashville and Blount in Knoxville, with several 
additional academies, had their modest beginning, and, until 1816, these and a few 
private schools appear to have supplied all the reenforcement of family and ordinary 
church instruction im the State. At this time Congress made a generous distribution 
of school lands, which, had they been preserved would have placed Tennessee 
at the front of the roll of new States in all matters relating to the education of 
her people. This munificent benefaction consisted of 100,000 acres for two colleges, 
100,000 for academies, and 640 acres in each 6 miles square for common schools The 
history of this great landed property, like that of so many others in different States, 
is but another testimony to the bottom fact in popular education, that, without 
an obstinate determination among the ruling class of the people for the schooling of 
the children and youth, nothing can be done. That determination in Tennessee, as 
in all the States south of Pennsylvania, was a plant of slow growth. The intermi- 
nable legislative wrangles brought on by the attempt of the common school public to 
utilize the national bounty for the children, reveal the hostile elements in the eccle- 
siastical, social, and political centers of society that for eighty years postponed an 
effective organization of popular institutions for even the white children of the 
State. It was not till 1823 that any serious attempt was made to establish a school 
fund in Tennessee. Ten years later additional laws were passed, and in 1837 the 
fund was made a portion of the capital of the Bank of Tennessee. The fund grew 
with the passing years, although with no result adequate to the necessities of the 
people from the distribution of its income. At the breaking out of the civil war 
the State supposed itself to be in possession of a school tund of $1,500,000, all of 
which was wrecked in the destruction of 1861-1865. The State, on the restoration 
o! the Union, assumed its present school estate, on which it pays interest as its annual 
contribution to the common school, although 1t has not yet assumed any charge of 
the Agricultural and Mechanical College at Knoxville, which, under the name of The 
University of Tennessee, is becoming one of the prosperous and well-conducted 
seminaries of the higher education in the Southwest. 
One of the most interesting and instructive chapters in the history of education in 
the Southwest, when fully written, will be the record of the University of Nashville. 
It was chartered in 1786 by the legislature of North Carolina, first as Davidson, and 
after a brief period was named Cumberland College. In 1826 it was chartered as the 
University of Nashville. It was finally absorbed, as far as its literary department 
was concerned, into the Peabody Normal School, which may yet come to the great 
opportunity of becoming the first proper normal university of the country. eo 
     
-P-A-G-E-390
  314 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
But in spite of these fortunes it held up the banner of good learning and universal 
education, and sent forth nearly 400 full graduates, with 1,500 undergraduates, 
including 28 members of Congress and a large number of men distinguished in the 
influential walks of life in the Southwest. In 1824, after twice declining the invita- 
tion, Rey. Philip Lindsley, of New Jersey, a graduate of Princeton College, was 
persuaded to accept the presidency. He lived and toiled in the service of his adopted 
State till his death, subsequent to the war, but not till he had seen his beloved insti- 
tution reorganized for its new departure as the Peabody Normal School, under the 
efficient and inspiring leadership of Dr. Eben Stearns, aided by that great educa- 
tional benefactor of the New South, the first agent of the Peabody fund, Dr. Barnas 
Sears. 
By 1806 Blount and Davidson colleges; with an infant academy in each of the 
twenty-seven counties of the State, all of them staggering under the burden of 
impecuniosity, were laboring with the problem of education in Tennessee. The first 
grant of land to Cumberland College was wrecked, although a subsequent gift and 
the efforts of its friends enabled it to keep alive, with an occasional interregnum, 
till the first commencement under the presidency of Dr. Lindsley, in 1826. On that 
occasion the president delivered the first of the series of remarkable addresses on 
education in the South that has survived the general destruction of school literature, 
including reports and statistics, in the civil war. He calls the attention of his 
hearers to the educational condition of the State, from which not less than $500,000 
was annually carried beyond the Alleghany Mountains for the higher education, “A 
tribute to the supreme wisdom of distant and foreign States.” He asserts that, if 
placed on a firm foundation, in a year 500 students could be gathered within the 
spacious walls of the new university, and the expenditure abroad in one year, if 
utilized at home, ‘would create a Cambridge at our very doors.” 
His plan for the university was doubtless somewhat copied from the new Univer- 
sity of Virginia, and, could it have been carried out, would have made the University 
of Nashville for all time the head of the higher education in the Southwest. It 
included an arrangement of six groups of university buildings, a noble estate of 120 
acres, six great college dormitories, with recitation rooms that would accommodate 
one hundred students each, with lodgings for the majority of the twenty-three 
instructors, and seven houses for the accommodation of the president and leading 
members of the faculty. Each group of buildings should include a refectory and 8 
to 10 acres for gardening and exercise. Machine shops and an additional 100-acre 
farm would provide for a thorough organization of the industrial department of the 
university, which included in this plan a group of professional schools of all varie- 
ties. It was believed that $200,000 would be sufficient for the first outlay. Nash- 
ville was already a flourishing city of 4,000 people and Andrew Jackson an early 
member of the board of trustees. The president did not fail to remind his hearers 
that the village of Amherst, Mass., with but 2,500 people had recently contributed 
$50,000 to the founding of a new college on its beautiful hill overlooking one ot the 
loveliest of American landscapes, and dilated on the easy way in which a similar 
amount could be raised there, in the southwestern section of the Republic. 
Later, in 1845-1848, we hear again from the indefatigable president. Almost heart- 
sick with “hope deferred,” .a veteran yet an athlete, ‘striking out from the 
shoulder” in the very face of his adopted State, telling such truths as that, up to 
this period, outside a few schools and the university, there had been no real progress 
toward popular education, and recommending a return to the home training of the old 
New England days, as if a people that had so long neglected their schools would be 
either disposed or qualified for such an experiment. One-tenth of the white popu- 
lation of Tennessee was still in the bondage of an illiteracy even more harmful to 
the Commonwealth than the utter ignorance of the ‘‘inferior race,” to whom the 
sympathies of the zealous Northern educator on Southern ground did not seem to 
extend,

But no man can do everything, and the work of Dr. Lindsley, carrying the uni- 
versity in his heart and on his shoulders, with an average attendance of sixty to 
seventy students, and the indescribable burdens of a man occupying the foremost 
literary and educational position of an entire section of the Republic, remains a 
notable memory and a perpetual inspiration to the generous youth of the present 
day. Nashville still remains the educational center of the Southwest, and, with 
Vanderbilt University and the reorganized University of Nashville, including the 
Peabody Normal School; a superior arrangement of common schools, first established 
in 1848; several flourishing seminaries for the secondary, higher, and professional 
education of the negro; excellent professional schools; an important public library, 
and several private and academic foundations for boys and girls, among the best in 
the South, is the final response of this great Commonwealth to the labors and sacri- 
fices of Lindsley and the noble band of his coworkers who, during the dark days of 
popular indifference and distracted educational councils, hoped on and toiled toward 
the sunrise of a brighter day. é 
In 1829 the first real movement was attempted in behalf of a system of common 
schools in Tennessee. The county authorities were instructed, in 1830, to appoint 
commissioners ‘‘to divide the county into school districts and number the heads of 
families.” An attempt had already been made, in 1823, to establish a school fund; 
and in 1838 the Commenwealth found itself possessed of $18,000 for academies and 
$100,000 for annual expenditure for common schools. In 1834 the revised constitution 
of the State provides as follows: 
ARTICLE XI. 
SEcTION 10. Knowledge, learning, and virtue, being essential to the preservation 
of republican institutions, and the diffusion of the opportumties and advantages of 
education throughout the different portions of the State being highly conducive to 
the promotion of this end, it shall be the duty of the general assembly in all future 
periods of this government to cherish literature and science. And the fund called 
the common school fund, and all the lands and proceeds thereof, dividends, stocks, 
and other property of any description whatever, heretofore by law appropriated by 
the general assembly of this State, for the use of common schools, and all such as 
shall hereafter be appropriated, shall remain a perpetual fund, the principal of which 
shall never be diminished by legislative appropriation; and the interest thereof shall 
be inviolably appropriated to the support’ and encouragement of common schools 
throughout the State, and for the equal benefit of all the people thereof; and nolaw 
shall be made authorizing said fund or any part thereof to be diverted to any other use 
than the support and encouragement of common schools; and it shall be the duty of 
the general assembly to appoint a board of commissioners, for such term of time as 
they may think proper, who shall have the general superintendence of said fund, and 
who shall make a report of the condition of the same from time to time, under such 
rules, regulations, and restrictions as may be required by law: Provided, Thatif at 
any time hereafter a division of the public lands of the United States, or of the 
money arising from the sales of such lands, shall be made among the individual States, 
the part of such lands or money coming to this State shall be devoted to the purposes 
of education and internal improvement; and shall never be applied to any other 
urpose. 
E Src. 11. The above provisions shall not be construed to prevent the legislature 
from carrying into effect any laws that have been passed in favor of the colleges, uni- 
versities, or academies, or from authorizing heirs or distributees to receive and enjoy 
escheated property, under such rules und regulations as from time to time may be 
prescribed by law.    
    
The law of 1829 provided that five school trustees should be elected in each dis- 
trict. But one of the most serious mistakes of this and subsequent legislation seems 
to have been the multitude of officials through which the school moneys were to 
pass before they reached the schoolhouse. In this journey they were lost or frittered 
away in a wilderness of detail. In 1838 another act was sent forth into the State to 
wrestle with the popular indifference or hostility to general education. It appointed 
a superintendent of schools to preside over the details of the administration of the

system; made 6 to 16 the school age; endeavored to achieve a school course, and 
restricted the distribution of State funds to districts that supported a school three 
months in the year. A rate bill was affixed to the system, and five commissioners 
for each county, elected for two years, managed the executive affairs of the district. 
In 1845 the feature of self-help was first introduced to the system, each district 
being permitted to tax itself for education. But in 1848 the governor of the State 
says: ‘The effort for popular education has slumbered and languished and pined 
and exists now rather as a memento of the past than as a living system for future 
growth and expansion.” 
But we have already exceeded the limit of our essay, 1790-1840, in this necessarily 
fragmentary account of the attempts of the common school public to plant a system 
of popular education on the soilof Tennessee, Outside less than a dozen cities, no one 
of the fifteen Southern States previous to the war, save, perhaps, North Carolina, had 
succeeded in establishing a common school system for its white children that com- 
mended itself either to rich or poor, the stigma of a pauper school and social infe- 
riority everywhere being attached to it. The absence of reliable records, either 
because of failure to keep them or by destruction during the civil war, must always 
be a great barrier against the most industrious historical investigation which 
attempts to do more than sketch the progress of educational affairs and do late jus- 
tice to the eminent men and women who then wrought in the faith and hope of the 
coming of the great hereafter in all the Southern States. 
KENTUCKY. 
To the student of the educational development of the American people, no chapter 
of this involved history is more crowded with significance than the record of the- 
prolonged and obstinate conflict through which the Commonwealth of Kentucky 
made its way to the nominal establishment of a common school system in 1838, only 
then culminating in a final ‘‘ general engagement,” crowned by the people’s victory, 
which placed in the constitution of the State a pledge for the safety of the school 
fund in 1850. The details of this long-drawn battle for the children, which, with all 
its relations to the building of an American State might be well amplified to a vol- 
ume, have been so often and so thoroughly told by the friends of the common school, 
especially by the able State historian, Hon. Z. F. Smith, first superintendent of pub- 
lic instruction after the civil war, that we may best refer the reader to these inter- 
esting memorials for more complete information than can be crowded into the present 
essay. It will suffice for the present sketch to attempt to overlook the field and out 
of the conflicting records of success and defeat endeavor to draw some general con- 
clusions that shed light on the original drift of American thought and the gradual 
rise and inevitable triumph of the people’s determination toward the American com- 
mon school. 
Tt must be remembered that, in comparison especially with the State of Ohio, the 
early settlers of Kentucky were neither cosmopolitan by origin nor an independent 
colony. The early movement upon the new Northwest from New England, and later 
from all the original thirteen States, was not a journey of exploration by a group of 
adventurous pioneers, but a thoroughly organized movement, with a fixed purpose 
of establishing new States under an imperative ordinance that secured the rights of 
the settler to his home, pledged the faith of the nation to provide the means for all 
grades of education and the support of the Christian ministry, and placed the infant 
Commonwealth under the protection of the most complete system of legal guard- 
ianship then existing in the world. On the contrary, from the early exploration of 
the vast wilderness of Kentucky by Daniel Boone and his pioneer associates, Boone 
himself a typical North Carolina ‘‘ man of the woods,” till 1ts admission into the Union 
as a State in 1792, almost a full generation, Kentucky was a restless backwoods 
province of Virgimia, with all which that implies in our primitive American history. 
Her early explorers and settlers were not the representatives of the powerful aris-

EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. ort 
tocracy beyond the Appalachian Mountains, but mainly a group of strong, self-willed 
men, of unusual native intelligence and great military and executive force, largely 
untaught by books or schools, but with a sprinkling of men educated according to 
the ideas of the day in that portion of the country. 
It was as representatives of the great middle estate which, under Thomas Jefferson’ 
overthrew the most concentrated aristocracy ever planted in the provinces and made 
the Virginia of the revolutionary epoch and the first thirty years of the national 
life, that men like George Rogers Clarke and his sort went forth to clear the ground 
for the coming ‘great West,” while Washington and the patriotic Northeast were 
holding the British Empire at bay along an unprotected coast line of 1,000 miles, 
At the same time this splendid little extempore army of the Northwest, with head- 
quarters in “‘the dark and bloody ground” beyond the great mountains, toiled, 
fought, and died with a chronic sense of the neglect, almost the contempt, of the 
mother, the Old Dominion. Only a few of the long-sighted statesmen of the home 
country, above all, Washington, appreciated the importance of what they were 
doing. The same feeling that, ninety years later, assisted in driving the entire 
State of West Virginia into the arms of the Northwest in the struggle for the 
preservation of the Union, wrought like a fire in the bones of Kentucky from 
the close of the revolutionary struggle till its admission as a State. So violent had 
this feeling become that the original clique of disunionists, who proposed to carry 
off the great Southwest, found in this State a hearing and succeeded in producing a 
turbulent and reckless condition of public opinion not a day too soon checked by 
the admission of the State to the Union in 1792. Even then, the agitators for the 
extreme idea of “State rights” in Virginia found in the new legislature of Ken- 
tucky the fit body of daring political theorists to challenge the new Republic in the 
famous Kentucky resolutions of 1798. 
It was this political prominence of the State which, like an ambitious and head- 
strong boy that had deserted the home to which he still held with a half-hearted 
allegiance, fixed the character of Kentucky for many years to come. The early 
early introduction of negro slavery determined its public destiny, as the aspiring 
political leader of the new Southwest. Henceforth the cosmopolitan and nationay 
type of emigration avoided this border land and swarmed the mighty realm of free- 
dom from Pennsylvania to the Pacific. This multitude also swept along a later con-» 
tingent from the new State, the descendants of the original settlers, men like 
Lincoln, Miller, and Corwin, thousands of able and liberty-loving youth who found 
it difficult to resist the steady drift of their native land toward the conservatism 
which has made Kentucky, of all the southern Commonwealths, perhaps the best 
remaining representative of the old-time aristocratic social constitution of the Atlan- 
tie South. 
These facts also explain the history of education in Kentucky during the seventy 
years from 1780, when the Commonwealth, after a most embittered conflict of opposing 
parties, finally planted the standard of the American common school in the revised 
constitution of 1850. The original settlers of Fincastle County, Va., beyond the 
mountains, were not indifferent to the importance of schooling their own children, 
and went about the work in the rough-and-ready way only possible to their provin- 
cial life. Each of the fortified villages; which were the only places of safety from 
the depredations of the savages, set up its school. One was taught by a woman, the 
humble pioneer of the mighty army of Western schoolmistresses who now teach, 
vote, hold office, and generally dominate the rising generation from the Alleghanies 
to the Pacific shore. More than one of these brave pioneer schoolmasters met his 
death about his work; all taught amid an environment of difficulty and peril that 
make the career of each a special romance. They took their meager pay in tobacco 
and the produce of the country. Several of them afterwards figured in the pulpit, 
on the judicial bench, and in the governor’s chair. They surveyed the land, like 
young Washington, fought wild cats and wilder Indians, and became the “men of 
   
-P-A-G-E-394
  318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
all work” in the new settlement. All these early schools were private, for the origi- 
nal Kentuckian was a man who “had no use” for a priest or a church that proposed 
to make him a docile disciple of any overbearing ecclesiasticism or stringent creed. 
In 1780 came the first experiment in Kentucky of the establishment of a school 
susidized by the State. Col. John Todd, afterwards a victim of the chronic malady 
otf an Indian massacre, appears as the only delegate of the Kentucky representation 
in the Virginia legislature who cared to moot the question of education. He pre- 
vailed on this body to make a grant of 20,000 acres of land, confiscated from British 
subjects in Kentucky, for the establishment of a school of the higher order. In 1783 
the seminary that was afterwards developed into Transylvania University was organ- 
ized with an imposing array of home celebrities as trustees, and with strict laws for 
the examination of its teachers and students, all of whom were exempt from military 
duty. The charter was premised with a stately preamble: ‘It is to the interest of 
the Commonwealth always to encourage and promote every design which may tend 
to the improvement of the mind and the diffusion of useful knowledge, even among 
the most remote citizens, whose situation in a barbarous neighborhood and a savage 
intercourse might otherwise render them unfriendly to science.” 
In November, 1783, the first meeting of this board of trustees, which, according to 
the local historian, comprised an eminent roll of the foremost men of all the profes- 
sions in the colony, met in the county of Kentucky, near Danville, filled the time 
with “high debate,” resolved heroically, and adjourned with a solemn call to the 
people of the district to furnish pecuniary aid to the new institution. The fact that 
“it was found impossible to do so” is one of the side lights, even at the beginning, 
cast on the educational record of the State. Why this eminent body of the fathers 
of the section which was alone to be benefited by it did not put their hands in their 
pockets, but left their enterprise to drag out a stinted existence for six years, until 
1789, when its first spasm of genuine life seems to have been experienced at Lexing- 
ton, is not so easy to be understéod. The first donation to the school came from 
distant Virginia, consisting of a small library and some philosophical apparatus. 
There was yet no newspaper in the colony and “only a few of the wealthy families 
from Virginia had books, and they of an inferior class.” The little school, under 
Master John Mitchell, with a salary of $400 a year, began its humble life under the 
‘shadows and almost stunned by the fast and furious din of the local political wrangle 
which even then dominated the ‘still small voice” of wisdom, pleading with the 
public men of Kentucky for justice to the children. At Lexington, again by a 
special act of the legislature of Virginia, the seminary found a temporary home in 
a house on a vacant place in a government lot, until a party of gentlemen raised 
the funds to build a two-story house and to give its present home to Transylvania 
in 1793, ten years after the first movement for its existence. 
Meanwhile private schools of various grades were springing up in different por- 
tions of the Territory, academies were chartered by the Virginia legislature, and pri- 
mary schoo!s generally established by neighborhood groups of families, instruction 
in the latter being limited to the elements. In 1794 the Methodist Church began its 
illustrious campaign for denominational education in the West, which, in one hundred 
years, has sown the seeds of culture through the highways and byways of the thirty 
Commonwealths stretching beyond the Alleghanies, to-day one of the most potent 
agencies for the general uplifting of the people. It began by the establishment of « 
Bethel Academy, in Jessamine County, on a high bluff above the Kentucky River. 
In 1795 the legislature of Kentucky, then a State of the Union, incorporated its first 
school in the Kentucky Academy. This was a Presbyterian school, started with a 
remarkable subscription paper containing the names of George Washington and 
John Adams for $100 each, and Aaron Burr for $50. First located near Lexington, it 
was endowed with 6,000 acres of land by the State. In 1798 the Kentucky Academy 
was united with the Transylvania Seminary, forming the Transylvania Uni ity. 
The two constitutions of Kentucky adopted in the first eight years of its existence 
as a State were silent on the topic of education, as were the messages of the early 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
  EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 319 
governors; but in 1807 a plea for a moré extended scheme of superior instruction 
was made by one governor, and one candidate for the office, who failed of his elec- 
tion in 1808, though standing on a platform with an educational plank. Not till 1816 
did Governor Slaughter take the field in a strong plea for a more generous provision 
for the people by schools, especially free to ‘‘the children of the poor.” In 1817 he 
returned to the subject in an extended passage in his message, which would make 
an excellent ‘‘fly leaf” for distribution among ‘‘all orders and conditions of men” 
anywhere in behalf of universal education. No Southern State is richer in an admi- 
rable literature of this sort than Kentucky. 
But it was not so much an insensibility to education as a source of personal power 
and public prosperity as an uncertainty about the way of applying it in the building 
of an American State that made the record of Kentucky in behalf of the schooling 
of the masses so parren during the first thirty years of her life as a Commonwealth. 
It is true there were many disturbing causes in these years which largely explain 
this neglect. We have already referred to the characteristic feature in the early life 
of this State, that before its admission to the Union it had been involved in a long 
and vexatious family difference with 1ts mother beyond the mountains, while, by a 
prodigal outlay of toil and sacrifice, it had done a great service to the new Republic. 
This peculiar training of the leading people who came to the front in State affairs 
gave to Kentucky at once a prominence in national affairs unprecedented in so 
young a Commonwealth. The passage of the extreme State rights resolutions in 
1798 had directed the attention of the whole country westward. This interest 
was kept alive by rumors of disunion connected with the great Southwest, aggra- 
vated by the perpetual and bioody Indian wars, and culminated in the war with 
Great Britain in 1812-1814, which spent its fury in the valley of the Mississippi, and in 
which Kentucky and Tennessee carried off the honors of the land service. A series 
' of able political !eaders from these two States, representatives of Southern ideas in 
the new Southwest, made the Congress of the United States the central field of 
activity for the aspiring young men of the section. The masses of the people were 
perpetually excited by calls to arms and by the hardly less fierce struggles of polit- 
ical life. All these things, in addition to the ordinary perils ot pioneer life, were 
doubtless a valid reason for the long neglect to make provision for the schooling of 
the people. 
But, in addition to this, perhaps more responsible than all these conditions for 
what came to pass was the fact that 1t became more evident as the years went on 
that Kentueky was to become one of the most conservative and able representatives 
in the Union of the peculiar ideal of socia! life produced by the institution of slav- 
ery. The failure of the early attempts to abolish the institution in Kentucky set 
in motion a steady exodus of the class of young men from the State into the opening 
Northwest whose presence at home would have told powerfully in the impending 
national conflict. Hence 1t came about that, although originally largely represent- 
ing the progressive element in Virginia, the successful public men of Kentucky, and 
behind them the most influential element of the population, were committed at an 
early date to the belief that the chief educational interest of their Commonwealth 
was the training of a superior class for eminence in the learned professions, espe- 
cially the Christian ministry, law, and politics. 
It was under this influence that the legislature of Kentucky as early as 1798 
entered upon the policy of subsidizing a system of county academies and a State 
university, with absolute neglect of the elementary education. Even in this there 
was an apparent advance on the line of the Virginia scheme of Thomas Jefferson, 
which provided that each county or district should have a “college” tributary to 
the State university, to which a select few should be admitted as free State pupils 
from the elementary schools, and these seminaries were to be generously subsidized by 
the State. It has been already shown how Virginia rejected this, with the common 
school department of the system proposed by her great statesman, and flung but a 
poor pittance to the masses for the support of what came to be justly regarded as “a  
-P-A-G-E-396
  320 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
pauper school.” But the Kentucky legislature took up the secondary member of the 
triple-headed scheme of Jefferson, and for the first thirty years in the life of the 
State wrought at its establishment with remarkable patience and for the time a 
reasonable liberality. 
A bonus of 6,000 acres of land was given to every county in the State for the sup- 
port of a county academy, still a “college” in the popular educational vocabulary 
of the section, and a large number of these schools were founded. At the same time 
Transylvama University at Lexington was, in theory, raised to the position of a 
State institution, although for an entire generation the State had given it altogether _ 
but $20,000. It was on these county academies that the first generations of the 
respectable Kentucky people depended largely for the schooling of their boys, the 
girls still being left on the back seat, with small care for their school instruction. 
But here was again demonstrated the fallacy of the idea that the secondary educa- 
tion can safely be made the fulcrum over which the lever of State education shall pry. 
It 1s possible, as European experience has shown, that a national government can 
support a magnificent system of university education, with a limited annex for the 
secondary studies, as long as the demand for the educated class is not too great 
and the admission to the upper story of life is guarded by strong barriers of sect, 
caste, and political privilege. But the absolute breakdown of the system of endowed 
secondary schools in England, which has forced from the greatest educators of the 
Empire the confession that in this department of schooling their country is behind 
all the leading European nations, was a warning that might well have been taken 
by some of our American States had it not come so late; for the imperative con- 
dition of success in any great scheme of American public secondary education is 
found in the establishment of a reliable and extended system of elementary schools, 
without which the most pretentious academy or college inevitably sinks in rank, the 
energy of its teachers being absorbed in setting green and ignorant youths on their 
feet in the elements of knowledge. 
This was the capital failure in the scheme of the Kentucky legislature and in more 
than one of the Southern and original Central States. Below the county academy, 
aspiring to handle the entire circle of the liberal education, was nothing but a hud- 
dle of elementary schools, extemporized in neighborhoods or supported by churches, 
generally inefficient for primary use and quite useless to graduate a class of pupils 
fit for a proper secondary schooling. 
In giving these generous subsidies, the legislature seems to have reserved no right 
of the State, either over the control of the funds or the direction of the instruction. 
These bountiful land grants were carelessly thrown into the hands of irresponsible 
boards of trustees, often self-perpetuating. The result was inevitable. A genera- 
tion of such experimenting, whatever might have been the temporary result on the 
education of the young men who attended the schools, left the great majority of these 
academies financially bankrupt, their generous endowment parted with “ for a song,” 
the avails of the sale absorbed in the erection of the first building, often with the 
income and principal the prey of incompetents or dishonest speculators. By 1820 
the academic side of the scheme came to naught. 
The State University only held on a decade longer. From the first the Transylva- 
nia Seminary and University seemed to stand to the different religious bodies of the 
State as a declaration of war. The appearance of every new faculty was the signal 
fora fresh outbreak. The conflict came to a head when Dr. Horace Holley, the great 
liberal preacher of Boston, Mass., was brought to Kentucky, with the most exag- 
gerated expectations of his friends, as president. Of the warfare provoked by his 
administration, the retirement of Dr. Holley, and his decease shortly afterwards it is 
not necessary to speak. Enough to say that while Transylvania remained a State 
institution under the nominal control of the legislature it received within its walls 
a large number of students afterwards distinguished in local and national affairs, 
among them the president of the Southern Confederacy, Jefferson Davis. But the
-P-A-G-E-397
  EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. - 821 
conflict ended with a victory for the opponents of State direction of the higher edu- 
cation, who captured the institution, which, after a protracted struggle of more than 
half a century, is now held as a flourishing collegiate school of the Christian denom- 
ination, probably a better institution of learning than ever before. The final estab- 
lishment of a State university wholly under the control of the Commonwealth has 
been the work of the past fifteen years. 
Meanwhile the power of the different religious bodies, somewhat in abeyance dur- 
ing the first generation in the life of the State, was now rapidly coming to the front, 
displayed in the erection of a number of denominational colleges and many acade- 
mies, which still remain the almost exclusive agencies for the secondary and higher 
education outside a few cities. Here was developed an influence even more 
unfriendly to the establishment of a thorough system of common schooling than 
under the former experiment. The first generation of the leaders of Kentucky were 
not especially enamored of ecclesiastical pretension in any denomination, and in 
their scheme of subsidizing county academies and the university appeared to have 
shared the broad ideas of Jefferson. But with the downfall of this experiment came 
in as & practical necessity the activity of the only set of people who for the coming 
years appear to have cherished a vital influence in education, the leading clergy of 
the different religious sects. Under their influence was built up a great number of 
schools of the average, occasionally of superior, merit, which in many of the consid- 
erable towns of the State still appear to the leading class sufficient for all educa- _ 
tional necessities, leaving the common school for the ‘‘common people.” Still it 
must be admitted that the movement from 1820 to 1850 in behalf of the common 
school was largely led by influential clergymen, Peers, Bullock, Bishop Smith, and 
Dr. Breckinridge being all eminent leaders in the church life of the State. 
By 1821 the failure of the system of subsidized academies had been so fully demon- 
strated that the attention of the friends of universal education was concentrated on 
the support of a system of elementary schooling for the masses. An act was passed, 
evidently suggested by the policy of Virginia, setting apart one-half of the net 
profits of the Bank of the Commonwealth as a literary fund to be distributed to the 
people for a general system of education, and the sum of $60,000 was at once found 
available. Then opposition came to the front. For thirty years longer the favorite 
policy appeared to be, after an act of apparently creditable generosity for building 
up aschool system, to reappropriate funds thus established and apply them to tlie 
ordinary expenses of the State. The history of the common schools in Kentucky 
from that early period to the present time is one of the most instructive records 
in the annals of the Republic of a persistent and patient campaign of education, 
which, like 
Freedom's battle, once begun, 
‘Though baffled oft, is ever won. 
Our present limits will compel us to halt on the eve of the final struggle between 
the opposing forces, which extended over the entire decade from 1840 to 1850, and 
was closed by the planting in the revised constitution of the State a provision for 
the preservation of the State school fund derived from the surplus revenue of the 
United States and its defense against all comers. 
The movement for the inauguration of a scheme of public elementary education 
for the masses of the white people was apparently successful in 1821 by the estab- 
lishment of a literary fund. But the triumph was short-lived. Within five years 
the legislative majority had captured and diverted the entire sum to other uses, and 
nothing came of the effort. A sharp contest over the appropriation of the revenues 
of the branch State bank to Transylvania and Central colleges seemed at first to have 
established a more liberal policy for these schools. At the same time Kentucky, 
in connection with several of the States, under the lead of Maryland, was moved, 
both in its legislative bodies and by its governor, to a remonstrance against the 
restriction of the educational grants of the national land to the new States of 
ED 96——11 
     
-P-A-G-E-398
  322 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
the Union. An elaborate report was made, strong resolutions were passed, and sey- 
eral governors protested vigorously against the great injustice of this policy, which 
left Kentucky and Tennessee especially “out in the cold” in this distribution of 
school lands. Nothing came of the movement, since, with the exception of the first 
two new Southern States, all the remaining new Commonwealths shared in this g 
and the old thirteen, for reasons of their own, seemed little interested in claiming their 
rights. And it could be said with some share of justice that inasmuch as Virginia 
had abandoned her own claim upon the whole territory of Kentucky and North Car- 
olina upon Tennessee, each of these States had within its own borders, like Te: 
ata later period, a sufficiency of land for all educational uses. Had tho original 
appropriation of their legislatures for education, reenforced by subsequent direct 
gifts from Congress, been carefully guarded and wisely used, there would have been 
little cause for such complaint. But the painful fact was that for a variety of rea- 
sons neither of these States in the first half century of its life was sufficiently 
in earnest concerning matters of universal education to insist on any strong control 
over or a wise and economical use of its valuable patrimony. 
The same influence that created the literary fund and urged the legislative demon- 
strations concerning the distribution of Government lands went further and caused 
the appointment of four commissioners, of which Mr. William T. Barry was chair- 
man, to collect information and devise a system of schools proper forthe State. The 
attempt of this committce to collect information from the home schools was a failure, 
their elaborate inquiries generally bringing no response. The result was a striking 
- reyclation of popular indifierence to the whole matter. Butearnest and able responses 
were secured from eminent statesmen of all sections, including Thomas Jefferson, 
James Madison, John Adams, and Robert Y. Hayne. The report of this committee 
is pronounced to-day by the leading educators of Kentucky one of the most impor- 
tant deliverances ever made in the State on the schooling of the whole people. Butit 
fell dead on the legislature, notwithstanding the efforts of Governor Desha to per- 
snade the fathers of the State to try the grand experiment. It did, however, bring 
out in full force the hostility of the average popular politician of that day to any- 
thing that would so surely, in his estimation, ‘disturb the political equilibrium” 
as a general advance in popular intelligence. For eight years longer this condition 
-of affairs continued, as usual the most intelligent people of the State endeavoring, 
py the building up of private, neighborhood, and denominational schools of every 
grade and the growing habit of sending young men and women away from home for 
education, to supply their own imperious need for the schooling of their own house- 
holds. 
In 1828-29 the new charter of the city of Louisville provided for the establishment 
of free schools, and a beginning was made of the present flourishing common school 
system of that city by the enrollment of some 300 pupils, instructed on the Lancas- 
terian monitorial plan by two teachers at an expense of $1,000 annually. But the 
rising spirit of educational reform was not daunted by the failure of the movement 
of 1822. Some of the presidents of the local colleges came forward as advocates of 
universal education, meetings were held, information circulated, and public opinion 
again aroused, Meanwhile the buildings of the State Transylvania University were 
destroyed by fire, and the effort to interest the legislature in the institution was only 
partially successful. The college struggled on against a hopeless public indifference 
a few years longer, and finally passed into the hands of the religious denomination 
which for the past half century and more has cared for its wants and now has made 
it one of the most prosperous of the collegiate foundations of the Commonwealth. 
The historians of this period point to Rev. Benjamin O. Peers as the foremost of 
the educational leaders developed by the emergency now upon the State. Accord- 
ing to one of them, ‘A close examination into the educational condition of Kentucky 
made by friendly eyes showed that in the 1,100 or 1,200 primary schools in the State 
in 1830 there were 31,834 children in school and 139,142 out of school. One large

county in the State, whose children numbered 893, did not have a school in its 
limits or a single child at school. Large tiers of counties had their children at 
school in proportions ranging from 10 to 300; from 10 to 180; from 10 to 140; from 10 
to130. * * * Even the most favored county in the State in 1830 had its children 
at school in proportion of 10 to 23. The number of people in New York who could 
then read and write, as compared with the whole population, was 1 to 3; while in 
Kentucky it was 1 to 21. Our State was behind three-fourths of the monarchical 
‘countries of Europe in the matter of education. Only Portugal, Russia, Poland, 
and France were behind us. Tho masses of our people as yet had manifested no 
abiding interest in the educational legislation of the State. Members of the legis- 
lature, when reproached for the slowness of their movements upon this great 
subject, always responded that their constituents took no interest whatever in the 
matter.” 
Tt is not strange that in such ajuncture two pronounced results were sure to occur. 
The growing common school public of the Commonwealth would be stung to an extra 
effort, both in the direction of a popular revival and action upon the legislature. But 
no action of the law-making power could be expected at once to meet an effectual 
response from a people still content with its position as the extreme rear guard of 
the educational army. Thelegislature again responded to the plea of the influen- 
tial and devoted school men of the State, and Rey. Mr. Peers was requested to make 
a report of his investigations among the common schools of New England and New 
York concerning matters pertaining to popular instruction. In 1830 he prepared 
another of those able and comprehensive documents which make the State as cele- 
brated for its rich educational literature as for its long and almost inconceivable pop- 
ular insensibility to the cause of general education. Mr. Peers’s report was not 
favorable to the attempt to establish a large school fund as a basis for a common 
school system, for the perversion of the Connecticut fund and the inefficiency of that 
of New York, these States having the only considerable school funds in the Union, 
seemed to him of unfavorable import. He saw clearly that an unmistakable popu- 
lar interest is the only firm basis of a movement to educate the whole people. He 
was also attracted by the success of Massachusetts in supporting her common schools 
by local taxation and supervision and recommended that as the most feasible plan. 
But he made the mistake, so common in all the States outside of New England, in 
supposing that a “district” carved out of a county or a “township,” which is only 
a local name, can have the qualification for local self-government of a New England 
“town.” Each of these towns was a genuine local republic—from its earliest his- 
tory instensely local and insulated in its public interests, endowed with many of the 
powers and obligations of an American State. Many of them, for a century or more, 
had been the most effective training schools in Christendom for the ability and dis- 
position to deal with a matter at once so personal and general as public education. 
Mr. Peers suggested the division of the counties of Kentucky, a new State not yet 
half a century old, into artificial districts, with some of the most important powers 
and obligations of a New England town for this special use. 
On the impulse of this enthusiastic report the legislaturo acted in the law of 1830, 
which was founded on the Massachusetts system, even then unsatisfactory to the 
educational reformers of that State. The county courts were instructed to district 
the State and their people were empowered to establish a system of public instrue- 
tion by local taxation. It was urged, in objection to the bill, that some twenty 
counties were so sparsely populated that “the heads of families did not average one 
to the square mile, the districts would be 10 miles square, and the children would 
require a guard to keep off the bears and wolves.” It was also urged that people 
with no property were given the power to tax those who had. These ominous pre- 
dictions unfortunately proved to be nearer the facts of the case than the hopes of the 
author of the law. The statute only landed another literary corpse in the edu- 
cational cemetery of the State. Not a school district was organized under its

provisions, The friends of the measure, with a chivalry worthy of that mucn-abused 
name, moved to wake up the popular mind and heart for eight years longer, until a 
more praétical effort could be attempted. 
The good providence which at last committed the State to the idea of public edu- 
cation was the distribution of the surplus revenue by the United States Government 
in 1836. Thus, after a fashion, was made a late atonement for the manifest injustice 
of the national policy in the omission of the old Atlantic States inits general distri- 
bution of school lands. The State of Kentucky received the sum of $1,433,757.40. 
The application of this sum being left to the decision of each State, the friends of 
popular education at once moved for the establishment of a common-school fund, 
and after the usual legislative wrangle, which raged around every measure for 
the educational advancement of the people, secured an appropriation of $850,000 as 
a perpetual fund dedicated “to founding and sustaining a general system of public 
instruction.” 
In 1838 this act was followed by the passage of another law ‘‘to establish a system 
of common schools in Kentucky.” The interest of the school fund, $850,000, was set 
apart for its aid, a school system was put on paper, and, in 1838, Rev. Joseph J. 
Bullock was appointed the first superintendent of public instruction. The new law 
was framed on the basis of the New York law, as that of 1830 had been on the system 
of Massachusetts. It did not propose a free, but a common school, very moderately 
subsidized by the interest of the State fund, the bonus of the Commonwealth to be 
given on condition that the people of a district should build a schoolhouse and lay a 
tax to support a school. In connection with the passage of the law a “campaign of 
education” was again attempted in the State, led by the first State superintendent 
of education. In this campaign, by popular addresses and the press, the people 
were informed and stimulated to effectual action. In 1840 a few districts in the 
State had been induced to act. A school tax of 10 to 30 cents on the $100 was 
voted in several counties. ‘The town of Versailles is said to have organized the first 
common school of the State under the act, and the county of Wayne adopted the 
new system entire. Bishop Smith, of the Protestant Episcopal Church, was 
appointed third superintendent of schools, and all things seemed ready for the final 
triumph of the good cause. 
Here, at the supreme crisis of popular education in Kentucky, we must leave the 
record of its efforts for schools. For fifty years had the common school public 
of the State labored, sometimes, perhaps, with “‘a faith not according to knowl- 
edge,” but with a persistence and expenditure of personal and moral power that 
reflects imperishable honor on their State, in behalf of the children against a com- 
bination of hostile influences sufficient to dampen the courage and exhaust the 
patience of men less in earnest and enthusiastic than themselves. But now, appar- 
ently on the threshold of success, it became apparent to this patriotic ‘‘army of the 
Lord” that it had only come up to the day of decision to face a violent conflict such 
as had hitherto not been encountered. All the forces of opposition and reaction 
made haste to combine for the destruction of the new system. This decisive contest 
was waged with varying fortunes through the coming ten years, from 1840 to 1850. 
At last the common people of Kentucky were aroused to the true interest of the 
State, and saw clearly the intention of the opponents of popular education. Happily 
for the Commonwealth, the great occasion found its great leader in Dr. Robert 
Breckinridge, who not only saved the common school to Kentucky, but fifteen years 
later again came up to the salvation of the Union, fighting the good fight at the 
State and national end of the great issue. The detailed account of this magnificent 
defense of the people’s school against all its foes, and the final victory of popular 
education in Kentucky, may well introduce the history of education in that Com- 
monwealth during the second half century of its life, from 1840 to 1890.

  EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 3825 
ARKANSAS, 
The two remaining Southwestern Common wealths, whose statehood comes within 
the range of the period included in this essay, are Arkansas and Texas. The former 
was admitted to the Union in 1836, with an area of 53,830 square miles and a popu- 
lation of 52,000, the third State carved ont of the vast ‘Louisiana purchase.” Texas, 
itself an empire in its immense area of 265,780 square miles, more than ten times the 
size of New York, with a population of 212,500, was admitted, then an independent 
Republic, into the Union in 1845, with the proviso that it might be afterwards divided 
into five States in all, an expedient to neutralize the possibility of a continuous 
accession of free States out of the ‘Louisiana district” of the Northwest. Neither 
Arkansas nor Texas was in any considerable state of advancement in the foundation 
of educational institutions by 1840. In each the establishment of the State univer- 
sity was postponed to a period subsequent to the civil war. 
In 1827 the Territory of Arkansas received the usual gift of one township of land 
for a university ; and in 1833, on receiving a valuable donation of school lands, the 
legislature devised a plan for leasing all the school landed property of the State, 
In 1838 the price of such lands was fixed, first at $10, afterwards at $6 per acre. 
But in 1844 the State turned the 72 sections of the university estate into the common 
fund for the support of schools, and in 1855 reduced the price to $4 an acre. What- 
ever of educational value was. established previous to this time was in the line of 
the private, family, and church substitutes for a system of public instruction, com- 
mon to the early life of all the Southern and several of the Northern States. 
In 1836 an article was placed in the first constitution of Arkansas which was good 
enough in itself to excite a great hope, but was destined to bide its time for a long 
probation before its prophecy became a recognized condition of society, on the bitter 
side of the Red Sea of reconstruction through which eleven of the fifteen Southern 
Commonwealths marched to a final destiny far more glorious than the dreams of 
their enthusiastic leaders of the earlier days. 
The constitutional provision of 1836 reads as follows: 
ArticLr VII. Knowledge and learning, generally diffused through a community, 
being essential to the preservation of a free government, and diffusing ‘the oppor- 
tunities and advantages of education through the various parts of the State being 
highly conducive to this end, it shall be the duty of the general assembly to provide 
by law for the improvement of such lands as are or may be hereafter granted by the 
United States to this State for the use of schools, and to apply any funds which may 
be raised from such lands, or from any other source, to the accomplishment of the 
object for which they are or may be intended. The general assembly shall, from 
time to time, pass such laws as shall be calculated to encourage intellectual, scien- 
tific, and agricultural improvements, by allowing rewards and immunities for the 
promotion and improvement of arts, science, commerce, manufactures, and natural 
BONY, and countenance and encourage the principles of humanity, industry, and 
morality. 
TEXAS, 
The portion of the Republic of Mexico which, under the name of Texas, had for 
one hundred and fifty years been a sort of ‘‘no man’s land” of border contention, in 
1835. revolted from this dominion, and under the leadership of a group of men of 
extraordinary ability, representing every section of the United States, achieved its 
independence. After a brief period of existence as the ‘‘ Republic of Texas,” it was 
admitted to the Union in 1845. 
In nothing did the fathers of Texas vindicate their claim to statesmanship so con- 
clusively as in their original provision for the education of the people. While yeta 
Republic, in 1839, the legislature granted 3 leagues of land in each county for a gram- 
mar school or academy, increased in 1840 to 4 leagues. The chief justice and two 
associate justices were made a school board for each county to protect the lands and 
make arrangements for the appropriation of the funds. In the more progressive 
   
-P-A-G-E-402
  326 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
counties schools, generally of the academic sort, were set up and the neighborhood 
system, resembling the old Southern type, inaugurated. The constitution of 1836 
was silent on the subject of education; but in 1839 three leagues of land were set 
apart for two colleges, and every tenth section of the vast territory granted to rail- 
roads and a navigation company was added to the generous school domain. Out of 
these and subsequent donations, all of which by the terms of admission to the Union 
were reserved to the State, Texas found itself in 1865 possessed of a school fund in 
public lands equal to that of half a dozen of the most favored Commonwealths of 
the Northwest. 
But the slow growth of the State before the war, its interminable extent of ter- 
ritory, and the system of disposing of school lands, which often seems to have been 
designed rather to invite population than to school the children, greatly delayed 
tho growth of the public school until the last fifteen years. Since that period the 
increase has been so rapid that in 1890 there were 150 graded free public schools in 
as many cities, villages, and counties, a number probably as large as, at that date, 
in all the old Atlantic Southern States. Within the past fifteen years the State has 
established a university for academic and one for industrial education, both well 
housed, well supported, and embarked on a fair career of progress, with a State 
normal school, a similar arrangement for colored youth, and a large supply of 
private academies. 
But this history of progress belongs to that period in which the details of the 
great movement of the half century of educational revival in the United States— 
1840-1890—should be written. It remains only to reproduce here, for convenient 
reference, the elaborate. provisions for general and university education at different 
times placed in the constitution of Texas. These read as follows:     
[Constitution of 1845.] 
AnTIcLE X.

of the rights and liberties of the people, it shall be the duty of the legislature of the 
State to make suitable provisions for the support and maintenance of public schools. 
Sec. 2. The legislature shall, as early as practicable, establish free schools through- 
ont the State, and shall furnis! eans for their support by taxation on property. 
And it shall be the duty of the legislature to set apart not less than one-tenth of the 
annual revenue of the State derivable from taxation as a perpetual fund, which 
fund shall be appropriated to the support of free public schools, and no law shall 
ever be made diverting said fund to any other use; and until such times as the leg- 
islature shall provide for the establishment of such schools in the several districts of 
the State the fund thus created shall remain as a charge against the State, passed 
to the credit of the free common school fund. 
Src. 3. All public lands which have been heretofore or which may hereafter be 
granted for public schools to the various counties or other political divisions in this 
State shall not be alienated in fee nor disposed of otherwise than by lease for a term 
not exceeding twenty years, in such manner as the legislature may direct. 
Src. 4. The several counties in this State which have not received their quantum 
of lands for the purposes of education shall be entitled to the same quantity bere- 
tofore appropriated by the Congress of the Republic of Texas to other counties,

ing to each part a fair proportion of land, water, and timber. 
In some respects the details of the constitutional provisions for education in Texas 
have been changed, due information concerning which will be given hereafter. 
IOWA. 
Turning to the new Northwest beyond the Mississippi which was included in the 
Louisiana purchase, we find the State of Iowa, organized as a Territory in 1838, 
admitted to the Union in 1846, with an area of 55,000 square miles and a popula- 
tion of 82,000. Even before its existence as an independent Territory the city of 
Dubuque built the first public schoolhouse in 1833. One of the first acts of the Ter- 
ritorial legislature, in 1839, was to pass a law providing for the establishment of “a 
common school or schools in each county for all white children and youth from 5 to 
21, school districts to be governed each by three trustees.” In 1840 a more compre- 
hensive law was passed. In 1841, five years before the admission of Iowa to the 
Union, a State superintendency of schools was established, to be suspended the fol- 
lowing year and revived in the first general plan for common school education, 
which followed immediately on the admission of the State to the Union in 1846. 
The first constitutional provision of the new State of Iowa, made in 1846, reads as 
follows: 
ARTICLE IX. 
Srcrrion 1, The general assembly shall provide for the election by the people of a 
superintendent of public instruction, who shall hold his office for three years, and 
whose duties shall be prescribed by law, and who shall receive such compensation 
as the general assembly may direct. 
Src. 2. The general assembly shall encourage by all suitable means the promotion 
of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement. The proceeds of all 
lands that have been or hereafter may be granted by the United States to this State 
for the support of schools which shall hereafter be sold or disposed of, and the 
500,000 acres of land granted to the new States, under an act of Congress distrib- 
uting the proceeds of the public lands among the several States of the Union, 
approved A. D. 1841, and all estates of deceased persons who may have died without 
leaving a will or heir, and also such per cent as may be granted by Congress on the 
sale of lands in this State, shall be and remain a perpetual fund the interest of 
which, together with all the rents of the unsold lands and such other means as the 
assembly may provide, shall be inviolably appropriated to the support of common 
schools throughout the State, 
Src. 3. The general assembly shall provide for a system of common schools by 
which a school shall be kept up and supported in each school district at least three 
months in every year; and any school district neglecting to keep up and support 
such a school may be deprived of its proportion of the interest of the public fund 
during such neglect. 
Src. 4. The money which shall be paid by persons as an equivalent for exemption 
from military duty and the clear proceeds of all fines collected in the several 
counties for any breach of the penal laws shall be exclusively applied, in the several 
counties in which such money is paid or fine collected, among the several school dis- 
tricts of said counties, in proportion to the number of inhabitants in such districts, 
to the support of common schools, or to the establishment of libraries, as the gen- 
eral assembly shall, from time to time, provide by law. 
Src. 5. The general assembly shall take measures for the protection, improvement, 
or other disposition of such lands as have been or may hereafter be reserved or 
     
-P-A-G-E-405
  EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 329 
granted by the United States, or any person or persons, to this State for the use of a 
university, and the funds accruing from the rents or sale of such lands, or from any 
other source, for the purpose aforesaid, shall be and remain a permanent fund the 
interest of which shall be applied to the support of said university, with such 
branches as the public convenience may hereafter demand for the promotion of 
literature, the arts, and sciences, as may be authorized by the terms of such grant. 
And it shall be the duty of the general assembly, as soon as may be, to provide 
effectual means for the improvement and permanent security of the funds of said 
university. 
MISSOURI. 
In 1820 the Territory of Missouri, organized in 1804 as a part of the vast upper 
“ District of Louisiana,” was admitted to the Union—the result of the first grand 
conflict and compromise of the two sections of the Republic on the contested ques- 
tion of negro slavery. The prohibition against the ‘‘ peculiar institution” in the 
ordinance of 1787 for the Northwest Territory did not affect the region beyond the 
Mississippi River. This had been secured to the slavery propaganda by the original 
contents of the agreement by which the Republic came in possession of the Louisiana 
purchase. The original French occupants who were found in St. Louis in 1804 were 
gradually outnumbered by the incoming of immigrants from all the States. In 1810 
there were 10,000 people in Missouri, all concentrated in a strip of territory upon the 
Mississippi River 15 to 20 miles wide. In 1808 two-thirds the area of the State was. 
in possession of the Indian tribes, but by 1815 all Indian titles were canceled. In 1811 
came the great earthquake which upheaved a region 300 square miles in extent, from 
the Ohio to the St. Francis River. In 1812 the population had increased to 12,000, 
scattered through five counties, each’ of the size of an ordinary New England State, 
and in 1820 there were 66,000 people in fifteen counties. In 1804 St. Louis was a 
French village of 180 log houses, the logs being set upright, surrounded by gar- 
dens. In 1809 it was incorporated as a town, and in 1820 “had streets of brick 
houses like Philadelphia,” 232 buildings of brick and stone and 419 of wood. In 1808 
the second newspaper published west of the Mississippi appeared at St. Louis, the 
first having been printed in New Orleans in 1794, There were 1,400 people in the city 
in 1811, briefly described by the epithet of the first judge of a Cincinnati (Ohio) court 
as “hotorogenous.” There were 12 stores and an annual trade of $250,000, largely 
in “ barter.” 
From four to six months was the regulation time of a voyage by an ordinary flat- 
boat from St. Louis to New Orleans, although a sailboat could make the passage in 
thirty days. But in 1817 the first steamboat puffed leisurely up to the wharves of 
the little metropolis, although that sort of craft had been navigating the Ohio and 
Mississippi since i811. By 1819 the whistles of sixty-three steamers were waking 
the echoes of the boundless wilderness between St. Louis and the Gulf. The Bank 
of Missouri, established in 1816, had 286 of its 780 shares in the hands of French- 
men; for many of the original families had prospered greatly in wealth by the rise 
in value of their estates. The Southern population, originally in a majority 
among the immigrants to this the northern borderland, flowed into this new province, 
where “‘ with two days’ work a week one could do as much as in a full week down 
East.” There also came a growing contingent from the old States, even New Eng- 
land sending some of her most reliable elements of population to this new land. 
The early settlers from the old States found little of any sort of education in 
this new Territory. At first Missouri was only a portion of the vast ‘‘ District of 
Louisiana,” under the Territorial law of Indiana. The population at once felt the 
striving of the American spirit, and petitioned Congress for an independent organi- 
zation of government and ‘that funds and Jands should be granted for the support 
of a French and English school in each county, in which also the classics, mathe- 
matics, and Constitution of the United States should be taught.” Eight of these 
fifteen petitioners were French. In 1807 the unpopular administration of Governor 
Wilkinson was succeeded by the appointment of Captain Lewis, one of the partners

in the famous Lewis and Clarke western exploring expedition, In 1812 Congress 
ordered that “all lands not of private ownership be reserved for school purposes” 
in a dozen of the larger villages of the new Territory. This grant was confirmed in 
1831, with the result that St. Louis ultimately came into possession of a great landed 
estate, from which an annual income of $50,000 to $60,000 is realized at the present 
time for common school purposes. For this the city was indebted to Mr. F- “) 
anative of Virginia, who made a horseback journey from St. Louis to Washington 
to carry the measure through. In 1812 Missouri was granted a full Territorial exist- 
ence, with a legislature, onc house being elected by the people, and a legislative 
council of nine members, which was appointed by the President of the United States 
from eighteen chosen by the lower house. 
As early as 1794 the Catholic Cathedral of St. Louis boasted the presence of a 
considerable library and several valuablo works of art, although a large proportion 
of the original French settlers were unable to read. In 1811 there were two schools 
in the little city, one kept by a young lawyer who afterwards became chief justice 
of the State, the other by a Frenchman, J. B. Tradeau, who held on for fifty years, 
from 1774 to 1825. But all these were private institutions. ‘As yet there was no 
such thing in the Territory as a public school.” In 1811 the Catholic College, now 
the St. Louis University, was founded in St. Louis. In 1817 the first step was taken 
toward organization for public school purposes in the city, one member of the board 
being the rising young politician, Thomas H. Benton. But for twenty-one years 
longer the effort was directed chiefly to carrying on the almost hopeless suit for the 
> recovering of the vacant lands ceded to the city by Congress. In 1820 the State had 
received the usual grant of public domain for common schools and a university, 
with the addition of valuable “‘saline lands” at a later period. It was 1838, and 
“after much contention,” before the first public school was opened in the city of 
St. Lonis. 
The State University was established in a very moderate way at Columbia in 1844. 
The common school domain consisted of 1,199,137 acres, with 46,000 acres for a uniyer- 
sity. It was not until 1842 that the first public schoolhouse was erected in St. Louis, at 
a cost of $10,000. By 1835 the legislature moved for a survey of school lands in each 
of tho counties of the State. But few township schools were established before 1837, 
In 1843, when the State had a population of 400,000, Dr. William G. Eliot, long known 
as one of the foremost educational men of Missouri, wrote to a friend in Connecticut 
that “there was no public school system in St. Louis.” There were four public 
schools for boys and girls, with 500 pupils; their mana ent was almost entirely 
left to the teachers, although nominally under the charge of a board of directors 
chosen by the people. The great expectation from the landed property, still im the 
courts, was a hindrance to the progress of education, an income of $4,000 being all 
that could be secured, while the present arrangement was utterly inefficient for the 
public demand, There were 100 children in Catholic and Protestant parochial 
schools. ‘‘ There were 80,000 people in St. Louis before there was anything done in 
behalf of public instruction.” Indeed the historian declares: ‘‘Up to 1842 Mis- 
souri, despite the patriot junctions of her citizens to the contrary, had done but 
little to favor the cause of popular education.” 
In 1839 Boone County obtained the university at Columbia by the payment of 
$117,900, and. $70,000 was obtained from the sale of seminary lands. In 1840 build- 
ings were erected; but for twenty-five years the legislature gave no support. Uni- 
versity lands, then sold ‘‘ for a song,” are now valued at $4,500,000. It was nine years 
before the university was really on its feet. In 1834-35 an act was passed to regulate 
the sale of the sixteenth section lands granted for schools. In 1839 a State system 
of schools was established by a law creating a superintendent, 6 to 18 being the 
school age, and in 1842 thirteen counties of the State received school money. In 
1843 10,000 and in 1844 21,000 pupils were in attendance on the schools. By 1850 the 
number had risen to 73,000, with a distribution of $27,000.

  EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 331 
But the ‘‘conelusion of the whole matter” was that up to 1840, twenty years after 
the organization of the State, with such opportunities as were granted to no Western 
Commonwealth, Missouri still ‘lingered, shivering on the brink, and feared to 
Jaunch away” in the great enterprise of the public schooling of her children. The 
loud call to the leadership of the new West, through the location of the possible 
metropolis of the Republic near the junction of her two great rivers, had been thrown 
away for the poor privilege of adding another to the roll of slave-holding Common- 
wealths. Outside of St. Louis and a few rising cities and towns the common schools 
had little success, even till the coming on of the civil war. But no State has more 
splendidly demonstrated the determination of the American people, through what- 
ever difficulties and delays, to educate the children for American citizenship than 
Missouri during the past twenty-five years, nobly redeeming the promise of her 
original constitution of 1820, which leads off in this prophetic strain: 
ARTICLE VI.—Of education. 
Srcrion 1. Schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged in this 
State; and the general assembly shall take measures to preserve from waste or dam- 
age such lands as have been or hereafter m4 ry be granted by the United States for 
the use of schools within each township in this ‘State, and shall apply the funds 
which may arise from such lands in strict conformity to the object of the grant. 
One school or more shall be established in each township as soon as practicable and 
necessary, where the poor shall be taught gratis. 
Src. 2. The general assembly shall take measures for the improvement of such 
lands as have been or may hereafter be granted by the United States to this State 
for the support of a seminary of learning, and the funds accruing from such lands 
by rent or lease, or in any other manner, or which may be obtained from any other 
source for the purposes aforesaid, shall be and remain a permanent fund to support 
a university for the promotion of literature and of the arts and sciences; and it 
shall be the duty of the general assembly, as soon as may be, to provide effectual 
means for the improvement of such lands, and for the improvement and permanent 
security of the funds and endowments of such institution. 
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 
It was characteristic of Washington that in his first message as first President of 
_ the United States he should invoke the attention of Congress to the importance of 
the educational question, and in his own guarded way suggest the direct interference 
of the National Legislature in its favor. The founding and occupation of the city 
bearing his name furnished an occasion for a more positive and practical presentation. 
of his educational views. He had long pondered the lurking danger of the obstinate 
differences of nationality, sect, and section to the new Republic, and through 
the exasperating and discouraging experiences of the war period had learned how 
easy it might be to destroy a Union not half appreciated by the masses and fought 
over with bitterness by the leaders of public opinion, His mind dwelt upon the 
establishment of a national university in the city of Washington where the promis- 
ing young men of all portions of the country could be educated together into a 
patriotic pride and affection for their whole country through observation of the 
operations of the Federal Government that might be a daily instruction in good 
citizenship and a preparation for a public career. At his death he left what seemed 
at the time and under the promise of the investment a generous sum in the stock of 
a projected canal for the establishment of such an institution of the higher learning. 
But the time was not ripe for the success of a project so broad and beneficent, 
Each section of the country had already built up its own school of the superior 
education. Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Princeton, The University of Pennsylvania, 
William and Mary, with other colleges of less note, were buttressed by an environ- 
ment of academical seminaries, each to a greater or less extent representing one of 
the great rival ecclesiastical parties of the country. It may not be possible to 
ascertain what has become of this donation of Washington, or if indeed it ever rep- 
resented a definite value. The fate of the original plan of a national university at

the National Capital was prophetic of all separate attempts in the same direction. 
While numerous schools of various grades have boldly assumed the name “ national,” 
no institution of learning has yet been established in Washington to whose merits 
the rapidly increasing fraternity of colleges and universities has done homage as 
the legitimate head of the American system of universal education. 
But could Washington have foreseen the present condition of educational affairs in 
the great and beautiful city that bears his name, in these closing years of the nine- 
teenth century, even he might have acknowledged that in all essential respects the 
National Capital is rapidly becoming a national university in a way that no institu- 
tion of learning, however famous, could be. With its excellent system of common 
schools, probably in general efficiency not inferior to those of any American city, and 
in some respects, notably in the education of the colored people, the best in the 
Union; the Catholic College at Georgetown, with Columbian and Howard univer- 
sities already established; the group of private denominational and professional 
schools; the national library, now sure of a permanent home, with the numerous and. 
valuable collections of books in the various Departments of the Government; the 
gathering of scientific men of national reputation in connection with Governmental 
operations; the National Museum and Smithsonian Institution; the sessions of Con- 
gress and the Supreme Court; the development of music and establishment of one 
valuable gallery of art; the great variety of associations, clubs, and groups of edu- 
cational people for mutual improvement; the residence of the official representatives 
of all the nations of the earth, and the development of the most characteristic type of 
American society—all these and other agencies working together, with the great plans 
for at least two new universities rapidly unfolding, make the city of Washington 
to-day the most important arrangement for that all-round education which will realize 
the ideal of American citizenship that filled the soul of the Father of his Country. 
But this latter day achievement is largely the result of influences that have come 
to the front since the close of the great civil war, which, among other things, changed 
Washington from a provincial to a national capital. The District of Columbia was 
originally composed of two essentially southern colonies on opposite sides of the 
Potomac River. Georgetown, the oldest of these, was a rural settlement of Mary- 
land people as early as 1751. The legislature condemned 60 acres of land at the 
falls of the Potomac River, out of which 80 lots were assessed, at a valuation of $280 
each, George Beall, the original owner of the territory, protesting to the last against 
the summary proceeding, but taking two lots by choice, on the principle of “better 
saving a little than being totally demolished.” But having treated itself to this 
sensation at first, the little town subsided into an educational slumber of sixty years 
before its people moved in behalf of popular education. In 1799 Georgetown College, 
the first Catholic college in the original Union, at first only an academical school, 
was founded by the ecclesiastical authorities of the Church in Maryland, although it 
was not till 1815 that it was authorized by Congress to confer degrees. 
Still this, the original settlement of the District, was in advance of Washington 
in its appreciation of the need of popular education. In 1810 a hundred substantial 
citizens of the place formed an association ‘to secure the advantages of education 
according to the system devised by Joseph Lancaster,” and raised $1,000 as an evi- 
dence of their sincerity. They memorialized the corporation for aid, but the first 
substantial gift was a school Jot presented by Leonard Neal, on which a schoolhouse 
was built and dedicated. The school opened in 1811, under the mastership of Mr. 
Robert Ould, a teacher sent from England by Mr. Lancaster. This school, which 
immediately gathered 340 children, was declared by its master ‘‘the second rea- 
Lancasterian school in America.” 
But a very natural prejudice against coeducation instead of destroying the school 
was made the occasion for obtaining a gift of $1,000 from the corporation to build 
an addition to the schoolhouse to accommodate 200 of what were gallantly described 
by the directors as ‘(the distinguished ornaments of creation.” This gift was made 
to extend over four years; but meanwhile the city government consented to appro-
-P-A-G-E-409
  EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 333 
priate $1,000 annually to the school on condition that all poor children should be 
educated free and at the close of their schooling be bound out to service. Ample 
arrangements were devised for supervision and reporting. The organization con- 
tinued for nine years with fair success. 
At this point an application for subsidizing denominational religious schools was 
made, but after a trifling experiment the city rejected the policy and thereafter 
went on by the method of supporting a public school through the united contribu- 
tions of friends, collecting tuition fees, and annual public gifts. For thirty-two 
years this school upheld the cause of popular education, as was done in the city of 
New York. In 1842 the city corporation assumed its entire control, and put it under 
the charge of a board of ‘ guardians.” This date brings us to the close of the period 
included in the present essay, and marks the change in administration from a private 
society, aided by the municipality, to the entire assumption of public education by 
the city. It is a pleasing record, such as was furnished by few communities in the 
Middle or Southern States at a date so early. 
But in the neighboring settlement, which afterward became the metropolis of the 
Republic, the cause of education did not thus prevail. From the first the people’s 
school moved on its laggard and wearisome way, like a vessel beating up the Poto- 
mac against a stiff north wind. The District of Columbia, composed of Washington, 
Alexandria, and Georgetown, was organized in the year 1800, each settlement under 
its own municipal control. The first charter of Washington in 1802 contained no 
notice of education. But in 1804, possibly through the influence of the first presi- 
dent of the Washington school board, Thomas Jefferson, a provision was inserted in 
the revised charter ‘‘for the establishment and supervision of schools.” An act 
passed the same year authorized the city “to establish and endow a permanent insti- 
tution for the education of youth.” An elaborate statute, with an eloquent pream- 
ble, provided for the election of a board of thirteen trustees—seven to be chosen by 
the city council from the body of the citizens and six elected by the contributors to 
the school fund. The sum of $10 contributed entitled the giver to a vote. This board 
was instructed to receive contributions at home and abroad toward the expense of 
educating the children of the poor. The avails of certain taxes, including the tax 
on ‘slaves and dogs,” to the extent of $1,500 a year, were available for this purpose. 
One hundred and ninety-one persons contributed the sum of $3,782, Thomas Jeffer- 
son giving the sum of $200. Jefferson was elected president of the board, with a 
body of twelve good men as assistants. In accepting the position he writes: ‘Sin- 
cerely believing that knowledge promotes the happiness of man, I shall ever be dis- 
posed to contribute my endeavors to its extension.” 
We seem to recognize the hand of Jefferson in the almost ideal scheme of instruc- 
tion proposed by this first board of trustees. Ié provided for the establishment of 
“an institution in which every species of knowledge essential to the liberal educa- 
tion of youth may ultimately be acquired in three great departments.” (1) There 
should be an elementary school for instruction in the common branches; (2) a col- 
lege equivalent to a modern high school; (3) a university ‘‘in which the highest and 
most splendid attainments may be acquired.” It was believed that while the ele- 
mentary school would be the special concern of the District, the college and univer- 
sity would commend themselves to the benevolent consideration of liberal-minded 
people everywhere, and that national aid might be hoped for. Buta current of 
common sense seems to have blown across the magnificent project, for it is suggested 
that all this must be of gradual achievement and that the incredulous public should 
not be too severely tried by the expert. A most eloquent plea, setting forth the 
advantages of education to the metropolis of the Republic, was drawn up and the 
“new education” stepped forth to fight its way through along period of indiffer- 
ence and hostility, a battle virtually prolonged for half a century. 
And for forty years it was a battle for life. What would have been the result had 
the friends of education in Washington, like those of Georgetown, courageously

334 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
faced the position and established a proper system of schooling for all classes and 
conditions of white folk, can not be predicted. As it was, the launching of a 
scheme for the support of a school for the poor, in which the ‘‘children of the indi- 
gent” alone should receive free education and the ‘‘pay department” at best be a 
sort of uneasy appendage, was sure to array against itself not only the prejudice of 
an extremely exclusive order of society, but, what was even more obstructive, the 
scheme was born with the stigma of the ‘“‘pauper school.” It was not till 1848, 
when the city came to itself and established a system of common schools for white 
children on the plan of the Northern and Eastern States, that any real success was 
achieved. 
The city first responded to the enthusiastic petition of tho thirteen trustees by an 
offering of $1,500 a year from the avails of certain taxes and fees. Two small schools, 
one half a mile cast of the Capitol, the other the same distance from the White 
House, were set up. Mr. Bentley was appointed the first teacher at a salary of $500 
a year, with the addition of the fees of the tuition pupils, out of which he was to 
pay the rent of his schoolhouse, hire assistant teachers, and meet all the general 
expenses of conducting the school. It was soon evident that no school system 
weighted like this could live, and this experiment came to aspeedy collapse The 
city soon reduced its appropriation to $800 a year, and in 1809 the two were merged 
into one school. During the first thirteen years the corporation had furnished but 
$10,000, and the contributions of the citizens, amounting to $4,000, alone held up the 
scheme. During ten years twenty different teachers had been elected, only to bo 
“starved out” or discouraged by the popular indifference to the obscure institution 
that was dragging outa feeble existence in the lower regions of the proud little 
capital on the Potomac, The board of thirteen trustees was a public vagrant, with- 
out a home, meeting anywhere and everywhere, half the appointed sessions failing 
for want of a quorum. Notwithstanding the concealment of the names of the 
charity scholars, the ‘‘ pauper” element was an indelibi» stigma that could not be 
overcome, 
- Baffled in their effort to commend the system to the people of the District, the 
trustees turned to Congress for ‘‘aid and comfort,” only to meet the same cold recep- 
tion. From 1812 to 1828 their efforts effected nothing but an indirect appropriation 
of city fees collected by the United States marshal and of all escheated estates. 
A lottery was authorized, and by a desperate effort, at large expense and the 
incurring of a city debt, was made to yield some $40,000, which has increased toa 
present fund of $60,000. Until 1818 there was an annual report by the management. 
But after that there seems to have been little inducement to ‘‘report progress,” and, 
for twenty-seven years, until 1845, the goings on of the educational department are 
to be laboriously gathered up from the occasional notices of the press amd formal 
reference in the city documents. In 1820 the schools were declared to be exclusively 
of the charity order, no pay pupils being received. Ihe whole story of these years 
is a melancholy record of a board of well-intentioned gentlemen, working ‘against 
the grain” of a community that could not be lifted up to the hearty support of a 
scheme of charity education, virtually confined to the children of the poor. In 1836 
a new effort was made to interest Congress by a memorial from the three cities, with 
the usual result. 
It was not till 1840 that the schools found a wise and persistent friend in the per- 
son of Mayor Seaton. He startled the good people of Washington by the announce- 
ment that only 1,200 of the 5,000 children of school age were attending the public 
and private schools of the city, leaving 3,800 out of school altogether. This, of 
course, included only the white children and youths, for all there was of schooling 
for the free colored folk was by private and personal effort. It is not to be supposed 
that the white population of Washington was in the desperate state of ignorance 
indicated by this startling record. But the Washington of that early day was not 
the charming metropolis of the present. It was a new and disagreeable town, far 
       
     
-P-A-G-E-411
  EARLY EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 335 
away from the great centers of social and cultivated life, where the wealthy and 
influential people schooled their children elsewhere and the “lower orders” drifted 
on, as in all communities of similar type. The population of the city must have 
been far less stable than now, and the contentions of national polities during those 
exciting years, including the second war with England and tho nullification move- 
ment of 1832, were doubtless a great hindrance. It was only by degrees that the 
press of the city came to pay any respect to the schools. In fact, a scheme of ‘pau- 
per education,” altogether including less than 1,000 children, with no fit place of 
abode, with schoolhouses, books, and apparatus of the lowest order, would hardly 
attract attention outside its own poor environment. 
But the time was favorable to a forward movement. Mayor Seaton had the good 
sense to understand that only by a challenge of the town to rise up and establish the 
American system of universal education at public cost could there be a reasonable 
hope of success. Tho fact that as soon as this plan of the mayor was plainly stated 
the city responded, and in 1844-45 put on the ground a system of common schools 
corresponding to that ef the chief Northern States, would seem to prove that it was 
not due so much to the indifference of the people to education as to the lack of com- 
petent leadership that Washington had so long remained in the rear rank of Ameri- 
can cities in this respect. 
In the city council Mr. J. F. Halliday brought forward a plan for a system of seven 
public schools, to accommodate 3,000 pupils, and a tax of one-sixth of 1 per cent on 
all the assessable property of the city. This precipitated a sharp discussion in which 
the poverty of the present arrangement, where 200 children were placed in surround- 
ings rather indicating ‘a place of punishment for offenders than a school for instruc- 
tion,” was made evident. John Quincy Adams, Caleb Cushing, Justice Woodbury, 
and other eminent residents of Washington added their powerful influence Tho 
result was the passage of the school law of 1844, by which a board of twelve trustees, 
three from each of the four wards, was chosen by the city council, and $3,612 was 
appropriated for erecting schoolhouses and renting rooms. From this date the pub- 
lic schools of Washington had a real existence. In the four years following this 
action more than $5,000 a year was appropriated. In 1848 a tax of $1 a year was laid 
on every white male citizen for education, and the board of trustees was assigned a 
place of meeting in the city hall. 
One of the most interesting chapters in the educational history of the national 
capital is the records of the efforts of the free colored people for the instruction of 
their children previous to 1860. In the nineteenth volume of Barnard’s American 
Journal of Education will be found an elaborate treatise in which the details of this 
wonderful story are set forth in a way so complete as to obviate the necessity of 
their repetition. Of course all this was in the line of private and Sunday-school 
work, the Sunday school at one time bearing the same relation to the elementary 
education of these people as at an earlier period in England. But so persistent was 
this moyement and so thoroughly did it impress itself on the mass of superior colored 
people that it laid the foundation of the remarkable public-school movement in 1862 
which has resulted in the development of the most claborate and successful system 
of common schools for this people in Washington known in the country. 
In the year 1807, two years after tho earliest movement for schooling the white 
people of the city, three men, Bell, Franklin, and Liverpool, established the first 
school for free negroes in the city of Washington. There were then but 5,000 white 
people in the city, 1,000 slaves, and 500 free negroes. When we consider the diffi- 
culties through which the first public school in Washington for white children strug- 
gled year after year through a sickly life with 5,000 people of the ‘superior race” 
behind it, we can appreciate the courage of these three men, all mechanics and just 
emancipated from slavery, in the establishment of their own school, representing 
but 500 people, with no hope of public aid. Neither of these men could read or 
write. Bell was the leader in the noble enterprise. His freedom was purchased by 
 
-P-A-G-E-412
  336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
his enslaved wife for $400, earned by market gardening, and he returned the favor 
by purchasing her freedom out of the first earnings of his free labor. The teacher 
of the school was a Mr. Lowe, a white man, and it was continued for several years. 
About the same time a Mrs. Alethia Tanner, afterwards the housemaid of Thomas 
Jefferson, began a remarkable career of purchasing, first, herown freedom, and then 
that of 21 relatives and friends, including the Cook family, which has been identified 
with the education of their people from the first. In 1818 an association of colored 
folk, under the name the Resolute Beneficial Society, established a school which 
first under the instruction of a relative of Rev. John Pierpont and afterwards of 
John Adams, the first colored teacher in the District, did good service. From that 
day until the breaking ont of the civil war, in Washington and Georgetown, and in 
Alexandria, until its retrocession to Virginia, in 1846, a series of schools for these 
people were established, each with some characteristic of special interest. Several 
of the most successful teachers were from England and Scotland, and a good num- 
ber of Southern white people of recognized social standing. At one time there was 
a habit of educating colored children in the private schools for whites, and even 
slaves were permitted to receive instruction. The Sunday schools of the leading 
churches had also a colored department. 
But all this came to an end in 1832-1834, when, as the result of the Nat Turner 
slave insurrection in Virginia, the public mind in the South was wrought to a high 
pitch of excitement. The schools of these people in Washington were largely 
broken up by mobs, the colored churches assailed, and several of the leading teachers 
obliged to flee the town. But nothing could suppress the determination of such as 
remained, and in due time the schools came up, every year better than before. ‘The 
~ constituency was not large, the free negroes of the Distriet up to 1840 not number- 
ing more than 6,000. A careful study of the records of these numerous private col- 
ored schools will show that a good proportion of the 1,000 children of school age 
must have been under instruction. The Catholic Church was not behind in this 
movement, There was one important school in Georgetown and another under the 
management of the Sisters of Providence, an order of colored women devoted to 
the education of their race, is still an important seminary for girls. The school of 
Rey. John F. Cook, teacher and clergyman, was the beginning of the valuable edu- 
cational labors of this family, one of whom is the excellent superintendent of the 
colored schools of the city of Washington. 
In this movement the colored people were supported by the sympathy and encour- 
aged by the aid of many leading people of the District. Thomas Jefferson did not 
hesitate to publish his belief that the African race is capable of education and 
should be admitted to all opportunities of good schooling. In a letter to Benjamin 
Banneker, a remarkable colored man of Maryland, the son of native African parents, 
who, by self-education, became noted as an author, mathematician, and mechani- 
cian, a publisher of an almanac, known to the learned societies of Paris and London, 
Mr. Jefferson wrote: ‘‘Nobody wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you 
exhibit that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to those of the 
other colors of men, and that the appearance of a want of them is owing only to 
the degraded condition of their existence both in Africa and America.” Jefferson 
sent the almanac of Banneker to the Academy of Sciences at Paris as a “justification 
against the doubts which have been entertained of them;” and it was quoted by 
Pitt, Fox, and Wilberforce in the British Parliament as an argument in behalf of 
the emancipation and education of the negro race. 
Out of this notable and most praiseworthy effort of the superior free colored people 
to educate their children it has come to pass that in no part of the country is there 
so fine a group of educated and worthy families of this race as in Washington. At 
the critical period of the civil war, when thousands of emancipated slaves were 
thrown upon the city, these people came to the front and have been largely influen- 
tial in the organization and highly successful management of their department of

the public school system, in which 12,000 children are now educated not only in 
elementary schools, but with excellent high, normal, industrial, and artistic train- 
ing, their teachers being paid the same salaries as those of the white race, with 
schoolhouses of the most approved pattern. Half the expenses of the public schools 
of the District of Columbia are now paid by the Congress of the United States, 
which also makes a generous yearly grant of money to Howard University, one of 
the earliest and best known institutions for the higher and professional education 
of this people in the country. 
CONCLUSION. 
The close of the first half century of the Republic may be regarded as the limit of 
the period included in this essay, At this decade, 1830-1840, the idea of the original 
New England system of public instruction, the organization, support, and super- 
vision of a scheme of education by the people, acting through the ordinary agencies - 
of local, colonial, and State government, had finally been adopted by every Common- 
wealth in the New England, Central, and Northwestern States; and although none 
of the slaveholding States had fully accepted the system, all were cither partially 
committed to it, or the educational public in each of them—a steadily increasing | 
factor in their educational affairs—was working along the same line, gathering the 
elements for the prodigious effort for the establishment of the American comiuon 
school as soon as the chief hindrance to universal education—the institution of 
slavery—should be removed. Before 1840 every American State had either adop‘ed, 
or its educational public was working toward, the ideal of a common system: of 
instruction and discipline, under the direction of the State, for the training of the 
children and youth into good American citizenship. 
If this story of the origin of the American common school has been fitly told, it 
will be seen that its one original, characteristic, and essential idea is only the appli- 
cation of the American idea of government and society to education. The American 
common school is only the American people keeping school. It is their will and 
pleasure expressed through the agency of a flexible majority. This is the radical 
note of difference between the American and any other type of national education 
in any previous age or i any European nation at the present time. And because 
this is its only essential characteristic the American common school has this con- 
spicuous advantage over all other systems: It becomes, in its development, tho 
recipient of the highest thinking, aspiration, and living of a great nationality com- 
posed of the most powerful and progressive elements of all civilized peoples, work- 
ing under the boundless encouragements and opportunities of a new world toward 
the realization of the broadest and most practical ideal of freedom consistent with 
a safe and conservative order of society. 
It is not therefore essential that the American common school shouid be free in 
the sense of instruction without direct cost to the pupil, although, since under all 
_conditions the indirect expense of schooling bears more heavily on the family than 
the public, it is good policy to make the public school free to all. Neither is. the 
system chained to any despotic or essential method of organization, discipline, and 
instruction. It ‘lives and moves and has its being” in the expanding educational 
consciousness of the whole people. Thus, it may with perfect consistency adopt 
much that is excellent in the systems of other peoples, avail itself of the fruits o7 
the largest educational experience every where, and make its own the most admirab!o 
results of the wisest thought and noblest achievement in all countries and all times. 
So that, ‘“without variablenesss or shadow of turning,” it abides by its own ideal 
that this is the people’s school. It violates no radical American principle and vindi- 
cates its right to ‘claim the earth” in behalf of the children of the Republic. 
In the rnde and tentative beginnings of the American common school, as in tho 
earliest motions of the colonial life, which was feeling after the beginnings of repul)- 
lican institutions, we have seen that misapprehensions and mistakes were inevitable. 
Hence, no State may claim exemption from criticism and none should resent a corre: &

  and fair statement of its early educational history. For no Commonwealth has 
failed to contribute some valuable element of thought in its foremost educators and 
rich experience from its various experiments in school-keeping toward the present 
condition of educational affairs. In each the educational public appeared in due 
season and became an inevitable and vital feature in the life of the State, wrought 
in its own way, and finally triumphed. And the most significant fact is that this 
victory was often achieved in a style inexplicable to the educational pedant, in the 
face and eyes of the schemes and predictions of the great educational theorist, ina 
way that can only be appreciated by him who believes in the American idea of the 
gradual development of the whole people under the direction of a gracious Divine 
Providence. 
The opening decade of the second half century of the Republic became mem- 
orable as the period of the great American revival of universal education. Under 
this great uplift of public sentiment, through the direction of the most notable 
group of educational leaders that had appeared in the country, the local district 
elementary school of the old time evolved into the graded common school of the 
later years; was immensely extended and enriched in all its departments; was 
especially improved in its methods of instruction and discipline, chiefly through 
native genius and experience, gradually by the careful adjustment of the best 
European methods to home use, and largely under the pronounced influence of the 
State normal schools, and most important of all is the fact that this was a veritable 
people’s revival, in which the intelligent and patriotic masses in every State were 
aroused, educated, and confirmed in the conviction of their imperative right and 
duty to provide the best for the children, 
One may see how this fruitful period of reform in education found its grand 
culmination in the generation that followed the close of the great civil war. Then, 
first, under the inspiration of a renewed and reconstructed nationality, the Ameri- 
can common school had free course, ran, and was glorified through the entire area 
of the Republic. And very significant is the fact that the older States, im which 
the conflict for universal education had been most involved and prolonged, now came 
to the front in the most decisive way and in some respects surpassed all the original 
States. And the South, that so long remained ontside the expanding circle of the 
common school, has responded to the ery of the children during the past twenty 
years by the most remarkable achievement in the organization and support of pop- 
ular education recorded in history. 
To the careful reader of this “ great and wondrous story,” who is in full aecord 
with the American idea, there can be no conclusion possible save a profound confi- 
dence in the American gospel of universal education, and an abiding faith that 
under a wise and gracious Providence the American people is now summoned to the 
apostleship of this gospel in a career only now well begun. 
_ [Nore.—The fact that the constitution of the State of Delaware in 1792 contained 
the provision for education, afterwards adopted in the revised constitution in 1831, 
directing the legislature ‘(to provide by law for the establishment of schools and 
promoting arts and sciences,” was inadvertently omitted; also, on page 276 the name 
Lyon should be spelled Ligon,—A. D, M.]

    The public library is recognized as one of the great forces in modern educational 
progress. For nearly thirty years the United States Bureau of Education has con- 
stantly emphasized the importance of these institutions as aids to instruction, In 
every annual report from 1867-68 to the present year has appeared information 
relating to college and school libraries, and periodically the Bureau has published 
detailed statisties of public libraries. The annual report for 1870 contained a list 
of 161 principal libraries not including college libraries. The report for 1872 con- 
tained a list of 1,080 libraries of 1,000 or more volumes. A special effort was made 
in 1875 to obtain a list of all the libraries in the United States having 300 volumes 
and over. ‘The list as printed in the report for that year included 3,648 libraries, 
and of these, 2,039 had 1,000 or mote volumes. This list was also published in the 
great special report issued by this office in 1876. That report was a volume of about 
1,200 pages devoted to ‘‘Public Libraries in the United States of America, their

History, Condition, and Management.” The volume contained 39 chapters by as 
many as twenty eminent specialists in subjects relating to libraries. In the annual 
report for 1884-85 was published a list of 5,338 libraries of 300 or more volumes; 
2,988 of these libraries had 1,000 or more volumes. This list was reprinted in a 
pamphlet of about 100 pages. <A valuable chapter of about 70 pages appeared in 
the 1886-87 report devoted to ‘‘ Libraries in the United States.” The statistics of 
1,779 libraries were published in seven tables, classified as follows: (1) Free public 
lending libraries, (2) free public reference libraries, (3) free public school libraries, 
(4) free corporate lending libraries, (5) libraries of clubs, associations, ete., (6) sub- 
scription corporate libraries, and (7) circulating libraries proper. In 1893 this 
Bureau published 20,000 copies of a circular of information of 213 pages, giving 
the statistics of 3,503 public libraries in the United States having 1,000 volumes and 
over. The statistics collected were for the year 1891. Also in 1893 the Bureau pub- 
lished 20,000 copies of ‘Catalogue of A. L. A. Library, 5,000 volumes for a public 
library selected by the American Library Association and shown at the World’s 
Columbian Exposition.” So great was the demand for this publication that a sec- 
ond edition was printed in 1896. This special report contained about 600 pages. 
The papers prepared for the American Library Association for its annual meeting 
held at Chicago in 1893, and read before the World’s Library Congress at the 
Columbian Exposition, were printed in the Education Report for 1892-93. These 
papers, which were prepared by about twenty leading members of the association, 
occupy 324 pages of the above-mentioned report, pages 691-1014. A small edition 
of the matter was reprinted in a separate pamphlet. One of the most popular 
publications of this Bureau is Cutter’s Rules for a Dictionary Catalogue, which was 
published in 1876 as Part II of the special library report of that year. The third 
edition was published in 1891 in a pamphlet of 140 pages. The special report issued 
by this Bureau in 1886 on ‘‘ Educational Exhibits and Conventions at the World’s 
Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition, New Orleans, 1884-85,” contained 
much valuable matter in relation to hbraries. This report is now ont of print, as 
are all the earlier reports above mentioned. In addition to the statistics of college 
and school libraries published every year in the annual reports of this Bureau since 
1870, many of the reports have contained valuable facts concerning libraries in 
foreign countries. This is particularly true of the reports from 1888-89 to 1895-96.    
        STATISTICS FOR 1896. 
Five years having elapsed since the collection of statistics of public libraries pub- 
lished in Circular of Information No. 7, 1893, this Bureau sent out under date of April 
1, 1896, forms of inquiry to all the libraries reporting to this office in 1891 and to 
several thousand others. Efforts were made to secure the names of all the libraries 
in the United States, but it was the purpose to publish a list of only public and school 
libraries having 1,000 or more volumes. Nearly 10,000 addresses were obtained and 
from this number about 8,000 responses were received. The number of libraries 
reporting 1,000 or more volumes was 4,026; the number reporting less than 1,000 
volumes but not less than 300 was 3,167, while nearly 1,000 had fewer than 300 vol- 
umes each. To obtain the 8,000 reports it was necessary to send out 15,000 blank 
forms between the Ist of April and the Ist of August. Not more than 50 per cent of 
the librarians responded promptly, and many hundreds ignored the second and even 
the third requests forinformation. Itis presumed, however, that most of the libraries 
from which no returns could be obtained’ were so small that those in charge of them 
did not deem them of sufficient importance to be included in the list. It1s safe to 
assume that the list of 4,026 public and school libraries published in this report 
includes very nearly all the libraries in the United States having 1,000 or more 
volumes. (See page 366.)

  366 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96, 
THE STATISTICS IN DETAIL. 
The list of the 4,026 public and school libraries begins on page 370 of this report, 
and gives for each library all the information that could be obtained, The informa- 
tion called for covered some 25 items. Most of the larger libraries in which records 
are carefully kept made reports which are full and satisfactory, but a large propor- 
tion of the small libraries did little more than report the number of volumes. For 
example, only 2,851 of the 4,026 libraries reported the number of volumes added 
during the past year, and only 1,852 reported the number of books issued for home 
use in the same time. 
The list includes only the libraries reporting to this office. In cases where no 
reports could be obtained, after a third request, from libraries which appeared in 
the 1891 list, a special letter of inquiry was addressed to the postmaster. Wherever 
the library was reported as still in existence a fourth request for information was 
sent. These facts are recited to show that all reasonable efforts were made to secure 
returns from all libraries having 1,000 or more volumes. 
THE REPORTS SUMMARIZED. 
The number of volumes in the 4,026 public and school libraries in 1896 was 
33,051,872, as shown in Table 1. This was an increase of 7,074,229 over the number 
of volumes reported by the 3,503 libraries of the same kind in 1891. Here is an 
increase of over 27 per cent in the number of volumes, while the increase in the num- 
ber of libraries was scarcely 15 per cent. Unfavorable business conditions since 
1891 have operated to prevent the establishment of many libraries, yet the cheap- 
ness of books has been favorable to the growth of existing libraries with fixed 
incomes. More than half the increase in the number of volumes was made by the 
libraries in the North Atlantic Division, which shows an increase of more than 28 
“per cent in the five years. The North Central Division also shows an increase of 
about 28 per cent in the number of volumes, while the Western Division increased 
its number of volumes nearly 40 per cent. The increase in the South Atlantic Divi- 
sion was 18 per cent and in the South Central 21 per cent. The number of libraries, 
tho number of volumes, and the increase for each State can Le seen in Tablel. Itis 
also shown that the 4,026 libraries have 5,444,788 unbound pamphlets. 
Table 2 shows at a glance the effective work of the libraries during the year ended 
April 1, 1896. The number of libraries reporting their reading rooms supplied with 
periodicals was 2,166, and the number of periodical publications thus furnished to 
the public was 116,248. Only 2,851 libraries reported additions made during the 
year, the number of volumes added being 1,591,861. The additions to the number of 
unbound pamphlets aggregated 439,412, made by 1,303 libraries. 
The records kept in 1,852 libraries show that 35,075,055 books were issued to bor- 
rowers for home use. Only 594 libraries kept records of books issued for use in the 
library readingrooms. Thenumber of volumes thus issued was 7,706,830. All these 
items are given by States and divisions in Table 2. 
Table 3 shows that 765 libraries occupy their own buildings, and 548 occupy rented 
buildings. Of the 2,713 libraries not reported as owning orrenting a large propor- 
tion are school libraries which do not pay rent and yet can not be said to own the 
rooms they occupy in college or school buildings. 
This table also shows that 1,147 libraries are supported by taxation, 2, 346% by cor- 
porations, and 14 derive their pee from both these sources. The remaining 519 
did not state how they are supported. 
There were 1,558 libraries reported as free, 635 free for reference only, and 772 free 
to subscribers. The remaining 1,061 not reporting this item are in large part cor- 
poration libraries free to members. 
The number of strictly circulating libraries was 342, the number of reference 
libraries 705, and the number classed as both circulating and reference 2,600. 
Table 4 divides the 4,026 libraries into 19 classes, as follows: General, 1,560; school, 
940; college, 626; college society, 54; law, 127; theological, 97; medical, 44; Goy-

78; historical, 60; garrison, 14; mercantile, 10, and society, 108. 
Table 5 shows the classification of libraries according to size. There are 2 libraries 
of more than 500,000 volumes each, 4 more having over 300,000 volumes, 28 additional 
having over 100,000, 69 more with over 50,000, 155 additional of over 25,000, 411 more 
having over 10,000, and 630 more with over 5,000. The remaining 2,727 libraries have 
Jess than 5,000 volumes each, but over 1,000. 
Table 14includes the names of the 627 public libraries having 3,000 volumes and over. 
These libraries are entirely free to the public. They have in the aggregate 9,062,563 
volumes, as shown in Table 13. 
EQUIPMENT AND INCOME. 
Table 6 is a financial exhibit of largely more than half the libraries in the United 
States given by States and divisions. The total amount reported as received directly 
from taxation by 600 libraries was $1,679,210, and the amount appropriated to 773 
libraries by States, counties, and cities was $1,513,352 for the year. The amount 
received from endowment funds by 594 libraries was $1,035,052; 833 libraries received 
$336,441 from membership fees; 303 libraries reecived $38,634 from book rents; 625 
libraries received $529,350 from donations, while 1,017 received $729,547 from sourees 
not stated. The total income reported by 2,437 libraries was $5,911,636 for the year 
ending April 1, 1896. 
The permanent endowment fands of 605 libraries aggregate $17,570,673, The 
aggregate value of the buildings owned by 567 libraries is $33,291,259, The value of 
the books added during the year by 2,333 libaries was $1,574,410. 
The reader will find it interesting and instructive to examine in detail the statis- 
ties for each State as given in Table 6, This is the first attempt made by this 
Bureau to present a condensed financial exhibit of public and school libraries, 
Great care has been taken to give the number reporting each item so that in finding 
averages the libraries not reporting will not be included in the div 
  THE GROWTH OF FIVE YEARS. 
Tables 7 and 8 are orranged for comparison, the latter exhibiting certain statistics 
for 1891 and the latter for 1896. According to Table7 there was in 1891 an average 
population of 17,877 to a library while, in 1896, as shown in Table 8, the population 
to a library was 17,376. The same tables show that in 1891 there were 41 books to 
each 100 of population, while in 1896 the number had increased to 47 volumes to 
each 100 of population. An increase is shown in each of the five grand divisions, 
put in certain Staves the increase in the number and size of the libraries did not 
keep pace with the increase in population. It is estimated that the increase in 
population from 1890 to 1895 was 7,331,750, or nearly 12 per cent. As already shown 
in Table 1, there was an increase in the number of libraries of about 15 per cent and 
in the number of volumes of more than 27 per cent. 
The chart following Table 8 shows the relative number of volumes to each 100 
of population in the United States in 1896. 
THE GROWTH OF TWENTY YEARS. 
Table 9 shows the number of libraries and the number of volumes in cach State in 
1875. There were in the United States 3,648 libraries of 300 volumes and over, haying 
an aggregate of 12,329,526 volumes. Of the total number 2,039 had 1,000 or more vol- 
umes each, aggregating 11,487,778, while the remaining 1,699 libraries of less than 
1,000 each had a total of 841,748 volumes, 
; Table 10 is 2 summary of similar statistics for 1884-85. Thero were 5,388 libraries, 
ywith a grand total of 20,722,393 volumes, In the list having 1,000 or more volumes 
there were 2,988 libraries, with 19,401,199 volumes; and in the list having less than 
1,000 volumes, but more than 300, were 2,350 librarics, with 1,321,194 volumes, 
- Table 11 exhibits the statistics of the 3,158 libraries which in 1896 reported 300 or
-P-A-G-E-444
  368 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
more volumes, but less than 1,000. The total number of volumes was 1,544,386. 
Combining these numbers with those given in Table 1, it is shown that the total 
number of libraries reporting to this office in 1896 having 300 and more volumes 
was 7,192, and the aggregate number of volumes was 34,596,258. 
By comparing Tables 9 and 10 it will be-found that the per cent of increase in 
the number of libraries from 1875 to 1885 was 46, and in the number of volumes the 
per cent of increase was 68. A comparison between Tables 10 and 12 shows that the 
per cent of increase in the number of libraries between 1885 and 1896 was 35, and in 
the number of volumes the per cent of increase was 67, 
THE SMALL LIBRARIES. 
The statistics of the 3,158 libraries having less than 1,000 but 300 or more volumes 
are summarized in Table 11. The list of these libraries is not published in this 
report, As no special effort was made to secure reports from libraries having less 
than 1,000 volumes, it is believed that the number having between 300 and 1,000 vol- 
umes is largely in excess of the number given in Table 11. It is not improbable 
that there are in the United States 4,000 public and school libraries having less than 
1,000 volumes, but having 300 or more. 
Among the 3,158 libraries, the statistics of which are summarized in Table 11, there 
were 2,455 school libraries, 155 college libraries, 289 general libraries, and 259 of all 
other classes. 
It will be observed that 1,043 libraries, with 510,154 volumes, are in the North 
Central Division, and 785 libraries, with 337,455 volumes, are in the Western Division, 
California alone has 699 of these libraries, with 294,644 volumes. ‘This is explamed 
by the fact that the State provides for district school libraries. There are hundreds 
of such libraries of less than 300 volumes each, and doubtless many larger ones, not 
reporting to this office. The report of the State superintendent of public instruction 
for California for 1894 showed that the district school libraries of that State con- 
tained 711,161 volumes, and that these libraries were valued at $689,652. The amount 
expended for books for these libraries in 1894 was $55,722, and there remained a 
balance to the credit of the library fund of $55,007. 
New York stands next, with 213 school libraries, in this list. Ohio has 127, Penn- 
sylvania 123, and several other States have over 100 each. 
Since the statistics in the following pages were tabulated and summarized returns 
have been received from the following libraries having 1,000 volumes and over:

Utica, N. Y., 1,735 volumes; Diocesan Library, Philadelphia, Pa., 7,000 volumes; 
Phrenakosmian Literary Society Library, Newberry, S. C., 1,168 volumes. 
An additional list of libraries having 1,000 volumes and over will be printed in the 
next annual report of this Bureau. 
The work of collecting and compiling the statistics of public and school libraries 
in 1896, as printed in this chapter, was done by the following clerks in the statistical 
division of the Bureau of Education under the direction of the statistician: Mr. 
Lewis A. Kalbach, Mrs. Frances A. Reigart, Mrs. Pearl Woolverton, Miss Nathalie 
Leveque, and Miss Bertha Y, Hebb.

LEGISLATION FOR THE INCORPORATION OF LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS, 
SOCIETIES, ETC. 
The library, like every other institution of organized society, is dependent upon 
legislation for its existence and development. The progress of library development 
at first was ver. yslow. Ithas grown fr om very small beginnings. Itis an outgrowth 
of a demand of the people. existence of the library was recog- 
nized by legislation. In the next place, the preservation of the library was aspecial 
object of leg gislation. Asan example, the library of the Rey. Thomas Bray, D. D., 
founder of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, may bo 
mentioned. Tho legislative assembly of South Carolina, on November 16, 1700, passed 
an act in behalf of this library. In 1715 North Carolina passed a similar Jaw for the 
preservation of a library sent over by Dr, Thomas Bray to the town of Bath, for the 
use of tho inhabitants of the parish of St, Thomas in Pamlico. 
Tn 1731 a movement began which resulted in the formation of the Philadelphia 
Library Company, called “the mother of all North American subscription libraries.” 
ge company was incorporated in 1742, some ten years after its organization. In 
1741 the Charleston, 8. C., Library Company was organized, but did not receive its 
charter of incorporation until 1755. 
From 1776 to 1826 many libraries were established which, though city institutions 
or otherwise limited, were in a general way important factors in the library move- 
ment, and were necessary and ‘logical steps toward the free public library. The 
earliest legislation regarding libraries took tho form of general laws which provided 
for the in corporation of cooperative library associations, “generally known as proprie- 
tary, social, subscription, or even public librari: There is now ina number of the 
States a genera] law providing for the incorporation of such libraries, namely: Col- 
orado, California, Florida, Hlinois, Indiana, Maine, New Jersey, New York, Massa- 
chusetts, Mississippi, Pennsylvs inia, Rhode Island, ‘Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, 
Wisconsin, and there may be some others in which similar provisions prevail. 
These libraries wer tended to be free, and in fact many of them were substan- 
tially free public librari They were not supported by public taxation. As another 
evidence of the inter that the people manifested in this movement, libraries of a 
certain size were exempted from taxation. This is an indirect though often an effi- 
cient way of legislating for libraries. The libraries of associations, societies, or 
corporations, together with the buildings owned by such associations, are exempt 
fromtaxationin the following States: Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, 
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, M nd, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and 
Wyoming—in all twenty-two. The increased interest in the subject is still further 
shown by legislative enactment in the following States: D et of Columbia, 
Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Jersey, West Virginia, Wisconsin, by which 
private libraries of a certain value are exempt from attachment as well as from tax- 
ation. Many libraries began under such encouragement.

II. 
(a) DISTRICT LIBRARIES. 
In this chapter it is proposed to discuss mainly the development of legislation 
regarding school district libraries. Governor DeWitt Clinton, of New York, in his 
message to the legislature in 1826, made a recommendation for the establishment of 
district libraries. In 1835 a law was passed by the legislature of that State estab- 
lishing school district libraries. These are not to be understood as libraries for the 
schools, but for the people in the districts corresponding generally in areas with the 
school districts. In each district the voters were authorized to levy a tax amount- 
ing to the sum of $20 with which to start a library, and $10 annually thereafter for 
the support of the same. 
In 1838 a law was passed appropriating the sum of $55,000 annually from the 
income of the United States deposit fund, This fund at the expiration of three 
years might be used for the purchase of books, or for the payment of teachers’ sala- 
ries, if the district so decided. In 1843 a special library fuiid was granted: by law 
to the school districts for the purchase of school apparatus and the payment of 
teachers under certain conditions 
These school-district libraries increased in number until 1853, when they con- 
tained an aggregate of 1,604,210 volumes. This, says one writer, ‘‘ was the high- 
_ water mark,” for, according to the report of the State superintendent of publie 
instruction for 1895, there was a general decrease until 1884, when the number of 
volumes reported in these libraries was only 701,437. From 1885 to 1891 there 
appears to have been a gradual improvement. From 1853 to 1894 the State expended 
on district libraries alone the sum of $1,706,144.36. 
The example of New York was followed by a number of other States, which also 
passed laws for the establishment of school-district libraries. Among these States 
were Massachusetts and Michigan in 1837, Connecticut in 1839, lowa and Rhode 
Island in 1840, Indiana in 1841, Maine in 1844, Ohio in 1847, Wisconsin in 1848, Oregon 
in 1854, Kansas and Virginia in 1870, New Jersey in 1871, Minnesota and Kentucky 
in 1873, Colorado in 1876. This system did not prove a success in all of these States; 
in fact it did not prove an entire success in any of them, for the concurrent testi- 
mony from all is that the scheme was a failure. The want of success is attributed 
to various reasous. First, because the unit (the district) was too small; second, the 
amount of money annually raised in each district was insufficient; third, the number 
of volumes in each was too small to secure anything like public interest in the care, 
preservation, or circulation of the books. 
Out of the failure of this system the States which enacted laws for the encourage- 
ment of the school district libraries learned from experience that additional legis- 
Jation was necessary. Hence many of the States subsequently passed statutes 
providing for township libraries. That is, the town was made the unit, and local 
taxation became the means of support, in whole or in part, for these libraries. 
    (b) TOWNSHIP LIBRARIES. 
The Massachusetts general court in 1848 passed am act authorizing the city of Bos- 
ton to levy # tax of $5,000 for the establishment of a free public library. his was 
a special act affecting only Boston, but it was the initial step. In 1851 this act was 
made to apply to all the towns and cities in the State. The act of 1848 for Boston 
is really the germ out of which has grown much of the library legislation in this 
as well as other countries. Mr. Fletcher, in his ‘‘ Public libraries in America,” say: 
“The first step in the movement for establishing public libraries ~ seems 
to have been taken by the Hon. Josiah Quincy, jr., mayor of Boston, in October, 
1847. He proposed to the city council, and they passed, a request to the legislature 
that Boston be allowed to lay a tax to establish a free library. The legislature 
assented the same winter, and this was probably the beginning of such legislation 
in any part of the world. In 1851, other cities and towns claiming the same permis- 
sion, thelaw was made general. Theinterestin libraries excited throughout England 
by the parliamentary investigation! already referred to (of which I shall say more 
presently), was perhaps the immediate cause of similar legislation in that country, 
but the leaders of the movement there confessed that the idea came to them from 
America.” 
New Hampshire, on July 7, 1849, passed a general law for free public libraries in all 
the towns of the State. It was the first law of its kind known in the history of 
library legislation. There is an interesting feature connected with library legislation 
in this State which it is well enough to mention. The town of Peterboro, in 1833, 
      
    
     
     
  
  
1 In 1847 a parliamentary commission was appointed; in 1850 commission made a report. 
 
-P-A-G-E-601
  LIBRARY LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 525 
established a free public library which is still in existence. This library was main- 
tained for many years in whole or in part by municipal authority, and 1s entitled to 
the credit of being one of the first, if not the first, public library in the United States 
supported by public taxation. Under date of August 7, 1875, the Commissioner of 
Education at Washington, D. C., wrote in a letter to the late Prof. Albert Smith, of 
this town: 
“The first free public library supported or aided by taxation of which this Bureau 
has any account was established at Wayland, Mass., and was opened to the public in 
August, 1850. The second, at New Bedford, Mass., was opened in March, 1853. If 
the Peterboro town library was free to the inhabitants of the town prior to August, 
1850, whether supported by municipal taxation or by the income of invested bonds, it furnishes the first example of a free library, and we shall be glad to give it the 
credit.” In another letter, of August 12, 18 “So far as any data are at present 
known to us, your library is the earliest of its kind. Should we obtain information 
of an earlier enterprise of the same kind, you will be duly informed.”     
  (c) FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES SUPPORTED BY THE STATE. 
The legislation in New Hampshire and Massachusetts had the effect of stimulating 
the movement in other States, and general library laws were passed as follows: 
Maine adopted a general library Jaw in 1854; Vermont in 1865; Ohio in 1867; 
Colorado, Iinois, New York, and Wisconsin in 1872 Indiana and Iowa in 1873; 
Texas in 1874; Connecticut and Rhode Island in 1875; Michigan in 1876; Nebraska 
in 1877; California, Minnesota, and New Jersey in 1879; Montana in 1883; New 
Mexico in 1884; Missouri in 1885; Kansas and Wyoming in 1886; North and South 
Dakota and Pennsylvania in 1887; Washington in 1890, and Mississippi (embodied 
in a municipal law) in 1892. 
In the District of Columbia,' Delaware, Kentucky, Nevada, North and South Caro- 
lina, and Oregon there has been no general library legislation. Provision is made by 
the Government for State libraries in the Territories. These libraries are for the use 
of the legislatures and the courts. In Kentucky general library legislation is now 
pending. 
Tt aie not be out of place here to call attention to the subject of school libraries. 
Two States are selected, and the legislation from these may be taken as typical of 
legislation with regard to this subject in other States. The provision invariably 
takes one of two forms, namely: 
1. Permission is given to the school district (almost always our local educational 
unit) to tax itself for the purpose of securing a school library, or 
2. The fund which is created by the State may be distributed to districts that have 
secured a certain number of books, or have taxed themselves to procure such books. 
It will be observed that there are some general principles upon which the States 
have encouraged the formation of school libraries, but there have been different 
methods of operating them to secure the object for which they were founded. For 
instance, the two adjoining States of Michigan and Wisconsin deal with the subject 
in a somewhat different way. 
In Michigan a ‘township library shall be maintained in each organized township, 
which shall be the property of the township, but be in charge of the township board 
of school inspectors.” But then 1t is added that ‘‘any school district by a two-thirds 
vote at any annual meeting may establish a district library, which shall be entitled 
to its just proportion of books from the library of any township in which it is situ- 
ated, and also to its equitable share of any library moneys remaining unexpended 
in such township at the time of the establishment of such district library, or shall 
afterwards be raised by tax or apportionment.” 
In Wisconsin ‘‘the treasurer of each town (not tovnship) may withhold annually 
from the money secured from the State school fund for the several school distri 
an amount equal to 10 cents for each p: nm of school age residing in the town for 
the purchase of books for a school library.” Under this law more than one-half of 
the districts in Wisconsin have been supplied with helpful libraries. ‘ Year by year,” quoting the State superintendent, ‘‘as teachers and pupils learn to use these 
libraries to better advantage, they are becoming of greater value as educational 
agencies.” 
“The States which passed these laws evidently recognized the principle that lies at 
the foundation of all legislation for free public libraries, that the library is and 
should be an essential part of the system of public education of the State, and, as 
such, should be maintained by public taxation; that it is the duty of the State to 
educate its citizens, and for that purpose public schools should be maintained. The 
public laws of many of the States had already recognized this principle. Here we 
see clearly set forth that the public library should complement the public school and 
be maintained in the same way as the public school.

  526 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
An efficient school system is hardly possible without the public library. From 
what has been said we see the tendency in library legislation. Encouragement and 
help on the part of the State has become more and more prominent. From 1849 to 
1889 the laws enacted in many of the States granted to the cities, towns, and com- 
mua/ties nothing more than the right to establish and maintain public libraries. 
Permissive laws were unsatisfactory, and mandatory ones began to take their place. 
About the year 1890 a new era began to dawn. The State becomes more than a 
passive agent; it takes action; it begins to manifest interest in the establishment 
of these libraries; it appropriates money for their support by appointing library 
commissions and providing, in some cases, for instruction in library economy, man- 
agement, ete. Henceforth the establishment and maintenance of the public library 
is declared to be a proper object of municipal expenditure. Massachusetts, on May 
28, 1890, passed such a law; New York, April 27, 1892; New Hampshire, March 22, 
1893; Maine, March 31, 1893; Connecticut, June, 1893; Wisconsin, April 19, 1895, 
and the District of Columbia March 18, 1896. Kentucky and New Jersey have such 
laws pending’ so that most cf the States now recog fully the importance of 
making the library free, and are already carrying out the ideaso beautifully set forth 
by Mr. George Ticknor in his letter to Edward Everett in 1851, which is as follows: 
“¥ would establish a library which differs from all free libraries yet attempted— 
Imean one in which avy popular book tending to moral and intellectual improve- 
ment shall be furnished in such number of copies that many persons can be reading 
the same book at the samo time; in short, that not only the best books of all sorts, 
but the present literature of the day, shall be made accessible to the whole people 
when they most care for it, that is, when it is fresh and new. I would therefore 
continue to buy adcitional books of this class almost as long as they are asked for, 
and thus, by following the popular taste—unless it should demand something inju- 
rious—create a real appetite for healthyreading. The appetite once formed will take 
eare of itself. It will, in a great majority of cases, demand better and better beoks,” 
(d) RECENT STATE LIBRARY LAWS. 
The following observations and suggestions on this subject have been contributed 
by Mr. Frank C, Patten, librarian ot the Helena public library, Helena, Mont. : 
The new educational movement for public libraries is everywhere a very rapidly 
growing one. These libraries are fast increasing in size and usefulners as well as in 
number. For the promotion of the best interests of this great movement experience 
shows that a good State library law is avery important facter. Such a Jaw, by laying 
out aplan, encourages the establishment and promotes the growth of public libraries. 
It is casier in any community to awaken interest in a library project if there is set 
forth in the State law a way of organizing the library that has proved successful 
elsewhere. The West is not behind in other educational good works, and it need not 
be in the matter of library legislation. 
Every year several of the States either make new library laws or make amendments 
to existing laws. The adyance in library legislation in the last few years is as marked 
as is the growth of libraries. The following are believed to be the 
      
    
   
  RECI 
  ATE LIBRARY LAWS. 
Massachusetts, 1890.—To be obtained from State librarian, Boston, who is chairman 
of Massachusetts library commission. 
Illinois, act amended 1891.—To be obtained from librarian Public Library, Chicago. 
New York, 1892.—To bo obtained from State hbarian, Albany. 
Connecticut, 1893.—To bo obtained from Miss Carolina M. Hewins, librarian Public 
Library, Hartford, who is secretary of Connecticut public library committee. 
New Hampshire, act amended 1895.—To be obtained from State librarian, Concord, 
who is a member of State board of library commissioners, 
Wisconsin, 1895.—To he obtained from secretary State Historical Society, Madison, 
who is a member of the State library commission. 
Michigan, 1895.—To bo obtained from State librarian, Lansing. 
In attempting the enactment of any new library legislation or of any amend- 
ments to existing laws a clear idea should be had of the essentials of a good State 
library law. The following provisions are in line with the dictates of experience 
in those States where most attention is given to public libraries: 
(1) A SURE AND STEADY REVENUE. 
The Jaw should provide that, on the petition of, say, twenty-five taxpayers, the 
rate of taxation for public library support in any city, town, or other political unit 
shall be submitted to vote at general or special election. The rate should not be 
changed without another vote. This plan provides for what 1s of the utmost 
importance, a sure and steady library revenue, not subject to changes of city council 
 
-P-A-G-E-603
  LIBRARY LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 527 
action. Under such a plan there need be no limit of rate placed in the State law, as 
no city will vote to tax itself too high for library support. A small place will, in 
fact, often fail to realize that in order to raise money enough to accomplish the 
object the tax must be at a much higher rate than in a large place. In Illinois the 
tax is in some places as high as 3 mills on the dollar. 
(2) CAREFUL AND CONSECUTIVE MANAGEMENT. 
In order to remove public library management from the influence of party politics 
the library and its property should be wholly left to the control of trustees selected 
from citizens of recognized fitness for such duties. Experience seems to show that 
in cities the proper board of trustees can best be secured by appointment of the 
mayor and confirmation by the council. Probably the best way is to provide for 
seven trustees, two to be appointed each year (one the fourth year) fora term of four 
years. This number is large enough to be representative and small enough to avoid 
the great difficulty in securing a quorum if the number is large. The length of term 
in connection with yearly appointment secures the much-needed continuity of man- 
agement, and yet there is sufficient change of officers so that the board will not be 
too far removed from the public will. 
(3) A STATE CENTER FOR LIBRARY INTERESTS. 
Within a very few years each of several States has provided for a State library 
commission, to be in some sense the head of public library interests for the State. 
By having small traveling libraries of fifty or one hundred volumes each to lend for 
a few months to localities that have no libraries, and by having a little State aid to 
distribute wisely, the commission is able to encourage communities to do more for 
themselves in the matter of a library than they otherwise would. The commission 
gives advice concerning organization and administration whenever it is asked, and 
a yearly report is made of their work and of library progress in the State. The 
State library commission has proved to be a useful agency wherever tried, and the 
plan seems likely to spread throughout the country. The most complete State sys- 
tem has been provided in New York, where all center in the State library at Albany 
as headquarters. The library system of New York seems to be working very success- 
fully. 
New Hampshire was the first State to pass a compulsory law (1895) obliging each 
town to provide a public library. . 
The following outline gives the 
IMPORTANT PROVISIONS FOR A STATE LIBRARY LAW. 
General.—Purpose of public library broadly stated, perhaps in the form of a 
definition. It may include loan, reference, reading room, museum, lecture, art, and 
allied educational features. It may have branches. Mode prescribed for changing 
form of organization of a library to conform to new law.! 
Establishment of public libraries.—Any political body authorized to levy and collect 
taxes may establish the library itself alone, or conjointly with other such bodies, by 
vote at any election. Vote of electors given for special tax or bonds to provide 
rooms or grounds and buildings. 
Maintenance.—By annual rate of taxation voted by electors to continue until 
changed by vote. 
Management.—Wholly in hands of trustees constituting a board so formed as to be 
independent of party political control. Appointment by mayor and confirmation 
by council a good planin cities. Membership to change gradually—one or two changes 
each year. Term of trustees not less than three years. Number of trustees not 
less than five. All property to be acquired, held, managed, or transferred by trus- 
tees. Requests and donations to the library to be held and managed for the public 
good by the trustees. 
Protection.—Penalties for theft, mutilation, overdetention, and disturbance. 
State publications.— Al] publications of the State to be distributed free to public 
libraries. ‘ 
State library commission.—A body to be at the head of public library interests of the 
State, preferably to have the management of the State library and to center its 
work in that institution. The State university library might be a good center for 
the work. Members might be appointed by governor and confirmed by senate for a 
term of five years—one appointment each year.    
1Libraries for schoolrooms to be composed of reference books, books for supplementary reading, class duplicates, and books for teachers should be provided for in the public school law. School funds should be used and school authorities should manage these libraries. ‘The business of lending books for home use is better and more economically managed by a public library organization. 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-604
  528 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
What may be done by the commission.—Give advice and instruction in organization 
and administration. Receive reports from all public libraries of the State and ren- 
der report. Manage the distribution of State aid. Manage system of traveling 
libraries. 
Counties or school districts may wish to establish and maintain libraries, and a law 
should be worded as to allow it. It is probably most convenient to have the library 
year correspond with the calendar year. It is well to have the trustees appointed 
and the report of the library made at a different time of the year from either the 
spring or fall elections. The library is thus more likely to be freed from the influ- 
ences of party politics. To have a library treasurer is probably the better plan, but 
library money may be kept in the hands of the city or town treasurer as a separate 
fund, and be paid out by order of the board of trustees only. 
Special conditions peculiar to each State often dictate modifications of any general 
plan for a State law. Anyone interested in the matter for his own State could read 
the general articles upon the subject and the various State laws, and then, with the 
assistance of the best legal talent to be obtained, frame an act appropriate to con- 
ditions of his State.

RESUME OF LIBRARY LEGISLATION. 
Alabama and Arkansas have no legislation on libraries. 
Arizona, in its school laws passed in 1885, permits school trustees in townships 
where there areea hundred school children to use $50 of the school fund and any 
donations they may receive for the purchase of books for the school libraries, which 
are to be free to the teachers and pupils and to residents on the payment of such 
sums as may be prescribed by the trustees. 
California, in 1854, adopted a district library law similar to that of the State of 
New York. In 1878 a law was passed modeled after the Ilinois statutes (see statutes 
of California). In 1880 an act was passed authorizing towns and cities to levy and 
collect taxes as in all other cases for the maintenance and establishment of public 
libraries and reading rooms. See page 533 of this Report. 
Colorado.—In 1872 Colorado enacted a law modeled after the Illinois plan, but the 
towns and cities did not take advantage of this law. In 1893 an act was passed 
authorizing the school board in any district to levy a tax not to exceed one-tenth of 
1 mill, the proceeds of which shall be used exclusively for the pu ase of books for 
a library, to be open to the public under such rules as the district board may pre- 
scribe. The laws now in force are given on page 536 of this Report. 
Connecticut.—In 1839 Connecticut passed a school library law, and a town library 
law in 1869. The public library laws of 1875 and 1876 permit towns and cities to 
establish libraries, but make no provision for their support by taxation. In 1881la 
law was passed permitting towns to levy a tax of 2 mills on the dollar of valuation, 
the funds thus raised to be used for the support of ‘public libraries; the fines for 
penal offenses may also be applied for the same purpose. In 1898 a law was passed 
making the State board of education a State library committee. This committee 
has the entire control of the public libraries of the State. (See p. 321 of the Publie 
Acts of the General Assembly of Connecticut, 1893.) A full text of the law is given 
on p 538 of this Report, 
L are.—The only library legislation in Delaware is an act to establish a State    
   
    
    
            library. 
District of Columbia.—A bill authorizing a municipal appropriation for the support 
of a public free library was passed by the House of Representatives on March 9, 1896. 
This bill carried an amendment assessing the cost of maintenance on the Districtand 
exempting Government proper On March 11 the Senate refused to concur in the 
amendment and the bill w: d over for conference of the two Houses. The bill, 
a copy of which may be found on page 539 of this Repors, became a law June 3, 1896. 
Florida.—In 1895 the legislature of Florida provided for the division of any county 
or counties into convenient school districts, and that any incorporated town or city 
might constitute a school district, and that money might be raised by taxation for 
the purchase of school libraries and text-books, tor the salaries of teachers, and for 
other educational purposes. This act also provides that the school commissioners 
may perform all acts reasonabie and necessary for the promotion of the educational 
interests of the county or district and for the general diffusion of knowledge among 
its citizens. 
Georgia, —This State has no general legislation on the subject of public libraries. 
The law requires that ‘‘money derived from fines for nonattendance at the county 
institutes shall be used in purchasing teachers’ libraries for the counties in which the 
fines are collected.” In this way an attempt has been made to gather under the

county superintendent of education a library in each county in the State, but as the 
law has but recently been put in operation, very little has been done as yet toward a 
collection of books. 
Idaho.—ldaho has no direct mandatory legislation as to public libraries; still there 
is a permissive act which gives the school districts the right to make purchases of 
library material to an amount not exceeding 25 per cent of the school fund for any 
one year. 
Ilinois.—In 1872 Mlinois enacted a law with minute details for the establishment, 
government, and management of public libraries, and this law has been substantially 
copied by many of the Western States. It provides for a board of nine directors, 
an independent body nominated by the mayor and approved by the city council. 
This board has exclusive control of the library, with power to erect or lease build- 
ings, etc. Towns and villages may levy a tax for the support of public librar 
tax not to exceed 2 mills on the dollar. Cities of less than 100,000 inhabi is 
mill; cities over 100,000 inhabitants, one-fifth of a mill. The full text of this law 
may be found on p: 40 of this Report. 
Indiana.—In 1871 Indiana passed a law making provision for public libraries. 
This law is claimed to be one of the simplest and most concise of any legislation up 
to that date. In 1873 the library association law was extended so that the towns and 
cities were authorized to have libraries. In 1883 the old library legislation was so 
extended that the trustees of the town where a library was desired might levy a tax 
of not less than one-fourth nor more than three-fourths of a mill on the dollar of 
assessed valuation for the support of the same. The money thus raised was to be 
paid over to the officers of the library for the purchase of books and library equip- 
ment. See page 541 of this Report. 
Towa.—In 1840 Iowa enacted a district library Jaw.- In 1873 a town library law, 
embodying a single section, was enacted authorizing any city or town to levy a tax 
of 1 mill on the dollar of valuation for the support of a free public library. 
Kansas.—On February 28, 1870, Kansas passed an act for the establishment of dis- 
trict school libraries. This proved unsatisfactory, as usual, and a free public library 
law was passed in 1886. 
Kentuoky.—In 1875 Kentucky adopted a general library law, but little progress was 
made under that law. A bill prepared by the alumne of the Louisville high school 
providing for the establishment of a State library commission is now pending in the 
Kentucky legislature. It provides for the appointment by the governor of five com- 
missioners who shall serve during 1896, without ri nd shall makesa careful 
of libraries in other States, extending their inquiries into organ ion, main- 
tenance, legislation, State systems, educational results of the work of libraries, and 
any other matters pertaining to the modern library movement. Not later than Jan- 
uary 15, 1897, the commission shall make a report in writing to the governor, embody- 
ing the results of their inquiry and recommending such plans and legislation as in 
their judgment will best promote the educational interests of the people of fhe State 
through libraries. (A copy of this bill could not be obtained.) 
Louisiana.—There is no library legislation in Louisiana, except that whick per- 
tains to the State library and to library associations. See library laws, page 546 of 
this Report. 
Maine.—In 1854 Maine passed an act-that provides that any town or city may raise 
by taxation $1 on each ratable poll for the establishment of a free public library, 
and 25 cents annually thereafter for its maintenance. Under this law nothing was 
done, from the fact that the allowance was so meager that without aid from private 
individuals nothing could be done. By an act approved March 21, 1893, it was pro- 
vided that any town may establish a free public library therein for the use of its 
inhabitants, and provided suitable rooms therefor, under snch regulations for its 
government as the inliabitants from time to tiie may prescribe. See library laws, 
page 548 of this Report. 
Maryland.—The Maryland Code, article 77, section 87, provides as follows: ‘ For 
further encouragement of education, district school libraries should be established in 
each schoolhouse district, under the care of the teacher as librarian. For this purpose 
the sum of $10 per annum is ordered to be paid by the board of county school com- 
missioners, out of the city school funds, to any schoolhouse district as library money 
as soon as the people of the district raise an equal amount annually.” See library 
laws, page 549 of this Report. 
Massachusetts.—Massachusetts began in 1851 with a law similar to that of Maine. 
In 1859 a larger tax was allowed, and in 1866 a law was enacted similar to that of 
New Hampshire, allowing any city or town to raise any sum which it deemed nec- 
essary. An act in 1870 “for the establishment of districts for maintaining street 
lamps,” granting power to “maintain street lamps, establish and maintain libraries, 
and maintain sidewalks.” The law of 1890 provides for a library commission. Mas- 
sachusetts seems to be the only State that has made and published a compilation 
of its library laws. The historical value of this compilation justifies its republica-

tion. On page 549 of this Report will be found the library legislation of Massachu- 
setts from 1798 to 1890. 
Michigan.—Michigan stands alone in having in tho first constitution of the State 
the following clause: ‘‘The legislature shall also provide for the establishment of 
at least one library in every township.” A school-district library law was enacted. 
in 1859. This plan proved a failure, as it had done in all the other States which 
adopted it. In 1877 a free public library law, similar to that of Illinois, was passed. 
In 1881 an act was passed authorizing the qualified voters of any school district in 
which a district library ‘‘may hereafter be established, to vote a district tax for the 
support of said library,” the tax to be levied and collected in the same manner as 
other township and school-district taxes. See library laws, page 566. 
Minnesota.—Minnesota passed a district library law in 1867. In the same year a 
law was passed exempting libraries and their buildings from taxation, and in 1875 
an act was passed for their protection. See libr: laws, page 568. 
Missouri.—In 1885 Missouri passed a public libri law very similar in “character 
to that of Illinois. This law was prepared by Mr. Crunden, of the St. Louis Public 
Library, and follows the Hiinois law, with slight variations. The law regarding 
district libraries is given on page 568. 
Mississippi.in 1892 Mississippi en: 
municipal laws). 
Montana.—In 1883 Montana passed a general library law, modeled after the Mlinois 
plan. It provided that the municipal authorities of any incorporated town or city 
may establish a free public library, and may levy a tas for its support not ex eeding 
1 mill on the dollar of assessed v aination. The law provides that the question of 
establishing a library must first be submitted to the voters of the district for accept- 
ance or rejection. 
Nebraska,—In 1877 Nebraska enacted a general library law, also modeled after the 
Hllinois plan, but going more minutely into details, Sée library laws, page 568. 
New Hampshire.—As has been noted elsewhere the first free publi library (sup- 
ported by municipal authority) was established in New Hampshire in 1833. This 
State enacted the first general free public library law in 1849. This law is very simple 
in form, and its main features remain une: hanged. Any town may raise and appro- 
priate money for establishing and maintaining a library without limitation as to 
amount and’ as to management (the money to ‘be raised by ordinary taxation). In 
1877 an act was passed for the protection of public libraries, and in 1891 the publie 
statutes of New Hampshire, chapter 8, sections 21 to 26, provides a law for the sup- 
port of free public libraries by the tate. See page 571. 
New Jersey.—New Jersey, following the example of many other States, has modeled 
her library laws after Hlinois. An act was passed in 1884 which provides that upon 
the approval of a majority of yoters at a special election it shall be the duty of the 
authorities to levy a tax of one-third of a mill on the dollar of assessed valuation 
for a public library fund. The board of trustees, composed of the mayor, superin- 
tendent of public instruction, and five others appointed by the mayor is made a 
corporate body to serve withont pay. The act further empowers three or more per- 
sons to organize a corporation for the purpose of establishing a free public library. 
See school library laws, page 572. 
New Mexico.—New Mexico, under an act of 1884 with regard to municips 
tions, allows the council or trustees of any city or incorporated town to 
money for a public library, provided the annual appropriation shall not exceed 1 mill 
on the dollar of assessed valuation, and the law further provides that no appropria- 
tion shall be made until the proposition has been submitted to a popular vote. 
far as can be learned, Nevada has no library legislation of any kind. 
New York.—As has been noted fully elsewhere, New York passed a district public 
library law in 1835. In 1888 the general assembly appropriated $55,000 annually 
for the support of these libraries. As elsewhere, however, these district libraries 
proved a failure. Under a provision of the school law in 1847, there were a number 
of free libraries supported indirectly by taxation. In 1872 a public library law was 
passed providing that upon the written petition of the majority of all the taxable 
inhabitants of any village, town, or ci its common council, board of trustees, 
or town auditors, may establish and ntain a free public library, each qualified 
voter being required to pay $1 for the foundation, and 50 cents annually thereafter 
for its maintenance. In 1885 the law was amended so as to include public reading 
rooms with or without libraries. It is not known that a single library was estab- 
lished under this la In 1886 a law was passed to encourage the growth of free 
circulating libraries in the cities. On May 13, 1887, an act was passed providing for 
libraries in towns and cities of less than 30,000 inhabitants. In 1892, an act for the 
encouragement of common school and public lik S was passed and approved by 
the governor on May 14. See library laws, pa 
North Carolina.—This State has no recent fepikee other than that pertaining to

including all legislation in regard to libraries, 
North Dakota.—In 1890 the legislature of North Daketa passed a law for the estab- 
lishment and maintenance of a law library for the State University. In 1891 a law 
was passed for the purchase of reference and pedagogical books for a State educa- 
tional library in the office of the superintendent of public instruction. In the same 
year a law was passed for the establishment of district school board libraries. For 
library laws, sco page 584. 
Ohio.—The first public library laws in Ohio were passed in 1867. Other laws were 
enacted in 1873 and 1875. Under the school libr; law of 1855 the State had an 
experience similar to that of New York, and in 1868 it v a question what to do 
with tho books of the school libraries of the State. Tho p: nt free public library 
law authorizes towns and cities to raise money by taxation for the establishment and 
maintenance of libraries. The law further provides that in cities of 20,000 inhabi- 
tants and over, the board of education may appoint a library commission of three 
who shall have entire control of the library, its administration, appointment of 
officers, etc., and even the levying of taxes for the support and increase of tho 
library, but this commission is amenable to the board of edueation. See library 
laws, page 585. 
Oregon.—'The only information obtained from this State is the following regarding 
school libraries, taken from the school Jaws of 1893: 
“Section 87a. Tho directors of school districts are hereby allowed to purchase 
from time to time, with the common school fund for their districts, such books of 
reference and apparatus as the interests of the school demand; and the books of 
reference and apparatus shall be kept at the schoolhouse during each term of school, 
for the use of the teachers and pupils: Provided, That the yearly expenditures 
therefor shall not exceed $50 in districts receiving $500 or over from the common 
school fund, and 10 per centum thereof in districts receiving less than $500 
therefrom.” 
= Pennsylvania.—Pennsylvania has a district library law passed in 1864, and a gen- 
eral library law for the incorporation of library associations was passed in 1874, A 
law has bi passed by the legislature appropriating all taxes on dogs for the sup- 
port and maintenance of publie libraries now organized, provided the library com- 
pany shall provide and maintain a free reading room for the town, city, or borough 
where established. See library laws, page 587. 
Rhode Island.—In 1867 Rhode Island gave the towns power to establish public 
libraries, ands in 1869 a law was passed empowering two towns to combine and form 
a library j In 1875 a free public library law was passed. Any town or city 
may lev “of 24 mills on the dollar of valuation for the establishment of a 
library, « tenths of a mill annually thereafter for the maintenance of the same. 
South Carol On November 16, 1700, the legislative assembly passed an act look- 
ing to the preservation of the library of the Rev. Thomas Bray, D. D., founder of 
for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. There has been no 
slation, except for the State library. 
.—There is no legislation in this State regarding public libraries. There 
Tennessee, as in a number of other States, general acts for the incorporation 
and protection of libraries. 
Texas.—Texas enacted a law in 1874 which provides that any incorporated town or 
city may ablish a free public library and may make such regulations and grant 
such parts of its revenues for the maintenance and increase thereof as the municipal 
government of the town may determine. 
Utah.—On March 9, 1896, the legislature of Utah passed a Dill which provides that 
the common council of a ‘city or town may levy a tax for the establishment and 
maintenance of public libraries. See page 590 for legislation in full. 
Vermont.—In 1865 Vermont established a law similar to that of New Hampshire, and 
in 1867 modeled a Jaw after that of Maine. It provides 50 cents per poll annually 
for the maintenance of the library. In 1869 a lib ssociation law was passed. 
In 1884 the general library law was amended by raising llimit of expenditure 
from $1 to $3 per poll for the establishment of a library, leaving the tax per poll at 
50 cents thereafter for the maintenance of the same. On November 9, 1894, a law 
was passed creating a library commission. Sec tion 1 of that act reads as follows: 
“The governor shall appoint five persons, residents of the State, who shall consti- 
tute a board of library commissioners. The governor shall designate the chairman 
thereof. One member of said board shall be appointed for the term of five years, 
one for four years, one for three years, one for two years, and one for one year, and 
thereafter the term of office of the commissioners shall be five years. All vacancies 
of said board, whether occurring by expiration of term or otherwise, shall be filled 
by the governor.” 
Washington.—So far as learned, there has been no general library legislation in 
Washington.

West Virginia.—Nothing reported from this State, 
iVisconsin.—In 1868 Wisconsin passed a law permitting towns and cities to raise 
by taxation annually $150 for the purchase of books. In 1872 a law was enacted 
similar to that of Illinois, by which towns and cities were authorized to levy a tax 
of 1 mill on the doliar for the establishment and support of free public libraries. 
In 1876 an excellent law, prepared by the American Library Association, was passe 
for the establishment and maintenance of libraries in towns and villages. The 
substance of the law is as follows: 
“The common council of every city not exceeding in population 50,000 inhabi- 
tants, and the village board, or board of trustees, of every village, and the town 
board of every town containing over 2,000 inhabitants, shall have power to estab- 
lish and maintain a public library and reading room, and for such purposes may 
annually levy, and cause to be collected as other general taxes are collected, a tax 
not exceeding 1 mill on each dollar of taxable property of such city, town, or vil- 
lage, or may set aside and appropriate a sum not to ex! 10 per cent of the money 
received in any year for Jicense issued for vending or dealing in spirituous, vinous, 
or fermented liquors, to constitute a library fund, which fund shall be kept by the 
treasurer separate and apart from other money of the city, town, or village, and 
to be used exclusively forsuch purposes: Provided, That no tax shall be levied with- 
out the same first be submitted to a vote and be approved by a majority of the 
votes cast at such election in such city, town, or village on such question.” 
For the government of such free public libraries the law provides for a board of 
nine directors who shall be appointed by the mayor, president of the town council, or 
chairman of village trustees, and approved by the general council of the city or town, 
the said directors to serve without compensation. The law of 1895, appointing a 
library commission, will be found on page 596. 
Wyoming.—The public library law of Wyoming, as it appears in the revised stat- 
utes of 1887, reads as follow: 
ON 681, When the ¢ ounty commissioners of any county have received proper 
ana ‘efficient guarantees, w hether in the form of conveyances or bonds of citizens, 
or associations or corporations, that a suitable place shall be permanently fur nished 
for the protection and use of a public library, as a condition precedent to their own 
action, under the provisions of this section it shall be their duty to levy annually a 
tax of not 1 than one-eighth of a mill nor more than one-half of a mill on the dol- 
lar on all taxable property in the county for the establishment and maintenance of 
a public library to be located at the county seat of such county.” 
The law also provides that the county commissioners may appoint three trustees to 
constitute a library board, the same to have entire charge of the organization and 
management of the librar The law further provides that no part of the library 
fund shall be expended for sectarian or professional books, and that not more than 
25 per cent of said fund shall be expended for works of fiction, but that the books 
          
          
             
       
   purchased “shall be of a kind best suited to inform the mind and improve the char- 
acter of the reader.” For library laws of the State, see page 597.

STATE LIBRARY LAWS. 
An effort has been made to collect the library laws of the various States and 
Territories. The success of this effort may be judged from what appears in the 
pages which follow. This effort, it is hoped, may be the means of stimulating States 
which heretofore have taken no action with revard to library legislation. The
-P-A-G-E-609
  LIBRARY LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 533 
information from many of the States is fragmentary and not altogether satisfactory, 
but it is given for what itis worth. In other States it appears that the library laws 
have never been compiled, so that it would require an extensive search to ascertain 
what laws regarding public libraries have been enacted. 
Massachusetts seems to be the only State that has published a compilation of her 
library laws. This compilation is of great historical value, and is given in full as a 
sample for other States desiring to make a compilation of their library laws. The 
laws of North Carolina are given at great length, as much on account of their 
quaintness as on account of the light which they throw upon the early history of 
the State. 
The more recent public library laws of several of the States are given as samples 
for other States that may be contemplating the establishment of public libraries. 
It may also beseen from this compilation what progress has been made in the several 
States regarding the establishment and maintenance of public libraries. 
The courtesy of the various State officials who have so kindly and promptly replied 
to letters of inquiry is hereby acknowledged.

COLORADO. 
[From Public Library Handbook, Denver, Colo.j 
Colorado’s library law is not in a very satisfactory condition, Statutes and parts 
of statutes passed at different times seem in part to contradict and in part to dupli- 
cate one another. Just what may and may not be done under the ting laws it 
would probably be impossible to determine except through judicial interpretation. 
The following digest may serve a good purpose in making it plain that our present 
library law is very obscure. 
‘The establishment and maintenance of free public libraries is declared to be a 
proper object of municipal expenditure. The trustees of any city or incorporated 
town may appropriate money for a public library if at a previous election a majority 
of the people have voted in favor of such action: Provided, No such appropriation 
shall exceed one mill upon the dollar. Every city or incorporated town in which 
such a library shall be maintained shall be entitled to receive a copy of the laws, 
journals, and all other works published by the authority of the State after the 
establishment of such a library, for the use of such library, and the secretary of 
state is authorized to furnish the same from year to year to such city or incorporated 
town. (Mills’s Annotated Statutes, sec. 4403, par. 76.) 
The clear proceeds of certain fines and pon suaes may be applied to the establish- 
ment and support of a public library. (Mills, 2817 
The council or trustees of any city or town may, if they see fit, apply any part 
of the clear proceeds of certain fines in aid of any libri ssociation for the benefit of 
the public: Provided, Such library association give the council or trustees such rep- 
its board of management as the ‘latter may ask. (Mills, 2821.) 
of any incorporated city may blish and maintain a public 
library and reading room, and may leyy a tax for such purpose of not to exceed one 
mill on the dollar annually ; in s of over one hundred thousand inhabitants this 
tax is not to exceed one-half of one mill on a dollar annually. (Sess. Laws, 1893, 
Chap. CXV, sec. 1 
When any city has established a library under the foregoing section, the mayor 
shall appoint six persons, who, together with the mayor, shall constitute the library 
board. The appointments must be approved by the ¢ ity council. (Sess. Laws, 1893, 
Chap. CXV, sec. 2.) 
One-half of these directors hold office for one year and one-half for two years 
from the first of July following their appointment. The mayor shallannually there- 
after appoint three directors, and shall fill all vacancies. Any director may be 
removed by the mayor and council for cause, (Sess. Laws, 1893, Chap. CXV, secs. 3 
and 4.) 
No directors shall receive compensation. (Sess. Laws, 1893, Chap. CXV, sec. 4.) 
Each director shall give a bond of five hundred dollars. (Mills, 2319.) 
The mayor is president of the board. The board elects other officers, and makes 
rules and by-laws, has exclusive control of the expenditure of all money, and the 
management of all grounds, buildings, rooms, etc., owned, leased, or set apart for 
jibrary purposes. The libr fund must be oposite din the city treasury. The 
poard has power to appoint a suitable librarian and assistants and to fix their com- 
pensation. (Sess. Laws, 1893, Chap. CXV, see. 5. 
‘All libraries established under this act shail be forever free. The board may 
exclude any person who wilfully violates the library rules. The use of the library 
may be extended to persons residing outside of the city, but within the State. 
(Sess. Laws, 1893, Chap. CXV, sec. 6.) 
The board of directors must make an annual report to the city council. (Sess. 
Laws, 1893, Chap. CXV, sec. 7.) 
The city council of any city has power to pass ordinances imposing suitable penal- 
ties for the punishment of persons injuring any book or other property of the library, 
or for the failure to return books borrowed. (Sess. Laws, 1893, Chap. CXV, sec. 8.) 
Any person may make any gift, donation, etc., to the libra by vi esting the title 
of the same in the library board, as special trustees. (Sess. Laws, 1893, Chap. CXV, 
sec. 9.) 
If fifty legal voters of any incorporated town present a petition asking that an 
annual tax be levied to establish and maintain a free public library, and a majority 
of the legal voters vote in favor of such action at the next annual election the tax

mentioned in the petition shall be collected and known as the “library fund.” Such 
tax shall cease whenever the majority of legal voters so determine. (Sess. Laws, 
1893, Chap. CXYV, sec. 10.) 
At the next regular election after any town shall have voted to establish a free 
public library, a board of six directors shall be elected, one-half to serve one year 
and one-half to serve two years. The board shall have the same powers as are con- 
ferred on the library board ina city. (Sess. Laws, 1893, Chap. CXV, sec. 11.) 
The board of any school district may order a levy of ‘not to exceed one-tenth of 
one mill, the proceeds of which shall be used exclusively for the purchase of books 
for a library which shall be open to the public. (Mills, 4032.) 
Any library association can sell or lease its property in any manner it may desire 
to the board of directors of any public library upon the vote of the majority of its 
subscribers or stockholders. (Sess. Laws, 1893, Chap. CXV, sees. 12 and 13.) 
Public libraries are exempt from taxation. (Mills, 3766; constitution of Colorado, 
Art. X, sec. 4.) 
The State librarian is directed to turn over to the librarian of any free public 
library in this State, if desired for public use therein, and to take the receipt of such 
librarian therefor, one copy of each and every such book, pamphlet, or periodical 
published by the State as can be spared, now on hand, or which shall be published 
by the State from time to time hereafter. (Mills, 2822.) 
  THE STATE LIBRARY. 
The State superintendent of public instruction is ex officio librarian for the State. 
The State library is open to the public from ten a.m.to twelve m.,and from two 
p.m. to four p. m. each day, except Sundays and holidays. (Mills, 2802.) 
The librarian has charge of all books, etc. ., and keeps a regular file of all such State 
newspapers as may be donated. (Mills, 2803.) 
He may employ an assistant librarian who shall have charge of the State library, 
under such regulations as may be prescribed by the State librarian or by law. The 
salary of the assistant librarian is one thousand dollars per annum. (Mills, 3979.) 
All books sent by other States are received and properly labeled 9nd arranged by 
the librarian. (Mills, 2804.) 
Receipt of each book 
     
    
is acknowledged and a record kept. (Mills, 2805.) 
The librarian mak d regulations. (Mills, 2806.) 
Statutes, journals, le » documents, and other books are to be exchanged with 
other legislative bodies and State libraries as the librarian deems proper. (Mills, 
2807.) 
All persons are permitted to visit the library, examine and read the books therein, 
and may take out any book and retain the same three weeks on depositing with the

  TOWNSHIP LIBRARIES. 
[1865, page 3. Approved and in force March 6, 1865.] 
4529. (Township trustee in charge.) Such library shall be in charge of the town 
ship trustee, shall be deemed the property of the township, and shall not be subject 
to sale or alienation from any cause whatever. 
4530. (Trustee’s duties.) Such trustee shall be accountable for the preservation of 
said library; may prescribe the time of taking and the period of retaining books; 
assess and recover damage done to them by any person; and adopt regulations neces- 
sary for their preservation and usefulness. He shall provide bookcases; also, blank 
books, ruled, in which to keep an account of books taken out and returned; and 
report the number each year to the county superintendent. At the commencement 
of each school term, at each schoolhouse in the township, he shall cause a notice to 
be posted up, stating where the library is kept, and inviting the free use of the 
books thereot by the persons of the township. 
4531. (Use of books.) Every family in the township shall be entitled to the use 
of two volumes at a time from said library, whether any member of such family shall 
attend school or not. 
4532. (Where kept.) The trustee may deposit the library at some central or eligi- 
ble place in the township, for the convenience of scholars and families, and may 
appoint for that purpose a librarian to have the care and superintendence thereof. 
i. (Pay of librarian.) When the township trustee employs a township librarian, 
he has authority to make a contract to pay him so much a year. The power to 
appoint a librarian gives the trustee the power to secure the acceptance of such 
appointment by paying a sufficient, but reasonable, compensation. There is no 
statute fixing a fee for such work, but the same is to be paid for out of the town- 
ship’s general fund for ordinary township purposes. (Baldwin, attorney-general.) 
4533. (When open.) The library shall be open to all persons entitled to its privi- 
leges throughout the year without regard to school sessions, Sundays and holidays 
excepted. 
    
        [1885, page 9. Approved and in force February 18, 1885.] 
4533a. (Tax levy for library.) Any township in which there has been or may here- 
after be established by private donations a library of the value of one thousand 
dollars or more for the use and benefit of all the inhabitants thereof, the township 
trustee of such townsliip shall annually levy and collect not more than one cent on 
the hundred dollars upon the taxable property within the limits of such township, 
which shall be paid to the trustees of such library, and be applied by them to the 
purchase cf books for said library, and may, with the consent of the board of com- 
missioners of the county, when it shall become necessary to erect or enlarge a library 
building, annually, for such period as may be necessary, levy and collect not more 
than five cents on the one hundred dollars upon the taxable property of said town- 
ship for not more than three years successively, which shall be expended by the trus- 
tees in the erection or enlargement of a library building. 
1. When the Young People’s Reading Circle books shall, collectively, even though 
they may be distributed to the several district schools in the township, amount to 
one thousand dollars in value, I think the trustee of such township would be war- 
ranted by the above statute in levying a tax of one cent on the one hundred dollars 
of taxables for the support and addition to such library. (H. D. Vories, superintend- 
ent of public instruction.)

2. If the people of the several districts, or the pupils of the several schools, should 
appoint trustees, in some uniform way, as they may choose, I think the intent of tho 
above section would be fully complied with. (H.D. Vories, superintendent of public 
instruction.)

of such township shall annually levy and collect not more than six cents on the 
hundred dollars on the taxable property within the limits of such township, which

may, with the consent of the board of commissioners of the county, when it shall 
become necessary to purchase additional ground for the extension or protection of 
library buildings already established by such private donation, annually levy and 
collect not more than five cents on the hundred dollars upon all taxable property of 
said township for not more than three years successively, which shall be expended 
by said trustees in the purchase of said property and the erection and enlargement 
of the library building thereon. (School Laws of Indiana, 1895, pp. 184-190.)

Approved, March 21, 1893. (Revised Statutes, chapter 242.) 
MARYLAND. 
The Maryland Code, article 77, section 87, provides as follows: ‘‘For the further 
encouragement of education, district school libraries ought to be established in each 
schoolhouse district, under the care of the teacher as librarian. For this purpose 
the sum of ten dollars per annum is ordered to be paid by the board of county school 
commissioners, out of the State school fund, to any schoolhouse district as library 
money as long as the people of the district raise the same amount annually. The 
books must be selected by the board of district school trustees.” 
To aid in the execution of this law, the State board of education resolved some 
months since to publish a list of books suitable for school libraries, and requested 
the undersigned to prepare a list to be submitted to the board. The several mem- 
bers of the board furnished valuable lists, and from these, and by aid of the cata- 
logues of the principal publishers of the country, and of published lists for public 
school libraries, prepared by the State superintendents of public instruction of several 
of the States, who kindly furnished us the results of their labor, this list has been 
compiled. 
It is arranged under three general heads, viz: (1) Books suitable for primary 
grades; (2) books suitable for grammar school grades, and, (3) books suitable for 
high school grades. 
Under the first head the subdivisions are fiction and miscellaneous; under the 
second and third, history, biography, travels, science and natural history, fiction, 
poetry, and miscellaneous. A list of reference books and one of professional books 
for teachers are added. 
We have endeavored to exelude all sectarian and partisan books. 
The books for primary grades have been selected with special care, and we hope 
will be found to be especially interesting and instructive. We have aimed to include 
the works of only the best writers of each class of books. 
The list gives the retail price of each book. Baltimore booksellers have agreed to 
furnish the books on the list to public school libraries at 2 discount of from 10 to 334 
per cent. We respectfully recommend you to deal with them. Some publishers 
allow a larger discount to dealers than others, and we consider the above offer fair 
and liberal. You can select a list of books and send it to your bookseller for net 
prices before purchasing. 
It is recommended that libraries be kept in substantial bookcases, and that books

“The State constitution provides that ‘The board of education (State) shall pro- 
vide for uniformity of text-books and the furnishing of schoolhouses with such 
apparatus and library as may be necessary, under such regulations as may be pro- 
vided by law.’

CHAPTER X. 
COMPARATIVE STUDY OF POPULAR EDUCATION AMONG 
CIVILIZED NATIONS: ADMINISTRATION OF POPULAR 
EDUCATION.! 
POPULAR INSTRUCTION DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. 
Various expressions have been proposed by which to characterize the nineteenth 
century, and though many are appropriate to it by reason of the multiplicity of its 
work, nevertheless the name which it particularly merits is that of the century of 
popular education. But this designation is not applied to the nineteenth century 
because it has originated public schools, for they existed centuries ago, and every 
civilized people, whether Buddhists, Mussulmans, or Christians, have taught their 
children to read and write. The merit of the nineteenth century lies in the univer- 
sality of its work in educating the masses of humanity. 
The Reformation contributed to the dissemination of instruction among the popu- 
Jace because it saw in education a means of advancing the cause of religion, yet it 
did not operate with equal force in all parts of Europe, as the history of education 
in England and Germany will bear witness. The eighteenth century in its turn 
also promoted the diffusion of education among the people, but not for the advan- 
tage of religion but in the name of humanity, as may be proved by the history of 
the German Empire of that period, of Scandinavia, and of many Catholic States. 
Nevertheless, the nineteenth century is the first which has systematized and gener- 
alized the education of the people for the value of education in itself, irrespective of 
its effect upon any particular form of worship. It has made education truly a matter 
which belongs to and is administered by the state. It is true that laws had been 
promulgated before the year 1800 regarding public education; indeed, the French 
Revolution furnishes a well known example. But these laws, speaking generally, 
were inoperative, and if some states were more advanced than others it is still a fact 
that at the opening of this century the majority of the people of the civilized world 
could neither read nor write. 
The growth of democratic ideas and of the application of industry to science has 
been favorable to the cause of populareducation. It began to dawn upon the people 
how profitable it would be for each inhabitant of a country to be able to communicate 
with or receive communications from others through ability to write and read. 
This ability once gained and used, it was seen, would break down the barriers 
which cut off a large part of the people from the influence of the current of the 
intellectual life of the nation, and alsoin a certain measure would efface the inequal- 
ity which is caused by the neglect to provide any kind of instruction for the masses. 
But people differed upon this subject. In Protestant countries the difference of 
opinion was, in general, less than in Catholic countries. There have been those, 
especially in Catholic countries, who were alarmed lest the instraction of the peo- 
ple should lay open the minds of the masses to the influence of new and dangerous 
1¥rom the French of E, Levasseur, member of Institute of France, translated by Mr. Wellford Addis. 
601

  602 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
notions; lest such instruction should develop a spirit of examination and criti- 
cism and thus weaken the respect for social status, and inspire the lowly with unat- 
tainable desires and entico them from the labor befitting the position into which 
they were born. In Catholic countries it was also maintained that popular educa- 
tion will lead to atheism. There are even now men and parties who hold these 
opinions. 
But there were others who were convinced that it is the duty of society to amel- 
iorate as far as possible the physical, moral, and intellectual well-being of its mem- 
bers; that the education of the people is the primal instrument of their intellectual 
amelioration, which in its turn will influence their moral amelioration and the amel- 
ioration of their physical environment, and that consequently the education of the 
people is a debt virtually contracted by society with the child, which debt society 
should pay either by favoring the establishment of schools or by assuming the 
expense of popular education. These persons have by degrees convinced the people 
and the Government of each nation that they are right. Most frequently it is the 
liberal party in each State which champions the cause of the education of the masses. 
“ Shower (repandez) instruction upon the heads of the people, for you owe them 
such a baptism,” exclaimed, at the close of the Napoleonic wars, the French adyo- 
cates of the Bell and Lancaster systems of monitorial instruction. 
The Christian Brothers had, indeed, from the beginning of the eighteenth century, 
a method of instruction which the Abbé do la Salle had originated and published 
under the name of “Conduite des ecoles Chrétiennes.” Pestalozzi also, inspired by 
Rousseau, had founded the Institute of Neuhoff, in Switzerland, about 1777, and had 
passed the rest of his life in the exposition of his ideas and in exemplifying the man- 
ner in which they should be applied. Prussia had, it is true, the school law of 
Frederic the Great, promulgated in 1763. Saxony had confirmed many times the laws 
of tho sixteenth and seventeeth centuries, and Bell and Lancaster had, indeed, cre- 
ated two different types of the monitorial system in the closing years of the cight- 
eenth century. But, in truth, it is only during the ninetcenth century that systems 
of pedagogy became the subject of much study and wide application and that the 
governing bodies energetically took up the question of schoolhouses, school furni- 
ture, and schoolkooks as something of public importance. In short, the nineteenth 
century has been infinitely more prolific in discussions, in pamphlets, and in books 
upon pedagogical subjects and works than all the preceding centuries put together, 
including the sixteenth, which was particularly fruitful in these particulars. 
The Government in every civilized country has since 1801 either enacted a law or 
has taken measures for the general introduction of public education. In Holland 
the first laws regarding public instruction were those of 1801, 1803, and 1806. In 
Bavaria compulsory attendance dates from 1802. In Prussia the ordinance of 1819— 
given out two years after the creation of the department of ecclesiastical affairs, 
education, and medicine, a position so acceptably filled for twenty-threo years by 
Altenstein—laid down the conditions of compulsory attendance in that State. In 
the Grand Duchy of Baden popular instruction was created in 1834. In the second 
half of the century the greater number of the German States multiplied continuation 
schools and made education compulsory. The greater number of the Swiss cantons 
created a system of schools between 1830 and 1848. Sweden, where education had 
been already well introduced in the cighteenth century, promulgated its organic 
educational law in 1842, and since 1850 this same law has been the law of Norway, 
transforming her itinerant schools into definitely located establishments. In Fin- 
land, long a dependence of Sweden, the schools that the Reformation had called into 
being proved inadequate, and the public schools were organized by the laws of 1858 
and 1866, while Hungary has made strenuous efforts to raise her schools to the level 
of those of the German peoples. 
In France the basic law, at least the first which was really efficient, is the law of 
1833. It owed its origin to the Government of Louis Philippe, and more particularly

“~ to M. Guizot. In England the first reform bill had opened the doors of Parliament to 
the mercantile class (bourgeoisie), and it had made the first appropriation for the 
construction of elementary schools. The committee of the privy council on educa- 
tion was instituted by tho English Parliament in 1839, but the first organic educa- 
tional Jaw was not passed until 1870, Some of the Italian States had school laws in 
the first half of the nineteenth century, but when, in 1859, Italy became a united 
kingdom the law of Piedmont was adopted for the whole peninsula and its islands. 
The law of Spain was passed in 1857. 
In the United States, after a formative period divided into a colonial and an organ- 
izing period, Horace Mann was appointed in 1837 secretary of the board of education 
of Massachusetts, and the first State normal schools were founded soon after, In 
1867 a National Burean of Education was founded. In Canada the fundamental law 
of public instruction in the province of Quebec went into effect in 1841. The school 
system of Ontario is duc to Superintendent Adolphus Egerton Ryerson, who assumed 
the duties of his position in 1844. The first law of the province of New Brunswick 
was promulgated in 1833. During the second half of the present century almost all 
the Spanish American republics modeled, partly at least, their school systems on 
those of the United States. 
The same activity in organizing public education has been shown in the colonies 
and countries under European control, as, for instance, in Algeria, Cape of Good 
Hope, India, British Australasia, and the Antilles. Japan, entering resolutely into 
the ideas of European civilization, created a system of public schools in 1872. 
The development of the idea of universal education has changed the moral 
equilibrium of the world. With science, which has changed the processes of indus: 
try and enormously increased the power of man oyer nature; with steam, which in 
annihilating distance by land or sea has given new facilities to commerce and new 
habits to nations; with the political changes, which have given to democracy either 
the dominating or at least a considerable place in the government of the majority 
of civilized States—with each of these achievements of the nineteenth century the 
instruction of the people is assuredly to be ranked as the most considerable phe- 
nomena of the nineteenth century and one of the most productive of happy results. 
The increase during the last fifty years of books, reviews, and journals published 
each year, of letters and printed matter transported by mail, furnishes a numerical 
proof of progress, though inadequate to give its full measure. 
There can be no question that the results haye sometimes failed to justify the 
hopes that apostolic enthusiasm had engendered. The founding of the school has 
not dispensed with the prison, for criminality has numerous causes, both individual 
and social, that can not be overcome by teaching children to read and write. The 
advancement of material well-being is not indissolubly joined, nor is it necessarily 
proportionate to the progress of education. It is even true that people may desire 
to feed upon debasing literature, as the success of more than one French periodical 
and more than one French novel will testify. The venality of the press is also an 
evil the growth of which it is deeply regrettable to see. But it is not necessary to 
conclude that this corruption by the agency of the press is entirely unremediable 
under the régime of liberty. Who, pray, should be impeached! The journal that 
wishes to live by obscenity and sophism, or the people who keep it alive by paying 
for it. Yet let us admit that revolutions so considerable can not happen without 
troubling certain interests, unclassing some persons, and causing to arise in some 
minds perverse desires. 
But it is not proper to judge such revolutions exclusively by the general trouble 
they cause and by their unpleasant details, for they must be judged in their 
entirety. It is undoubtedly not a matter of indifference that during the transi- 
tion from ignorance to knowledge the mob should exhibit an effervescence of con- 
fused ideas and a vomiting forth of insatiable desires, and that it should become 
more unmanageable. But ought not a thinker to ask himself whether those who 
deprecate these unquestioned evils do not find the mob so difficult to goyern because 
   
-P-A-G-E-680
604 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
it is less inclined to be governed according to their wishes and whether their wishes 
have always been for the interest of the mob? 
It is reiterated, especially in France, that when everybody shall be educated no 
one will desire to perform menial or arduous work, such as that of a domestic or a 
common laborer with pick and shovel. Assuredly, the diffusion of education will 
interfere with the present poise of the social strata and individual relations, and 
will, in addition, influence ‘both the salary and condition of persons. There will 
be occupations which will offer fewer chances of employment and there will be others 
in which such chances will abound, but as it is necessary, after all, that almost every 
human being shall live by work, it is inevitable that cach should come to the point 
where he will be willing not only to accept, but cven to seek an occupation by which 
a living can be made. 
Yet these inconveniences are of secondary importance. When the reconstruction 
is viewed as one whole its grandeur isapparent. It is therefore no exaggeration to 
say that public instruction has, in certain respects, been the redemption of humanity. 
If the desire of the savant to be always increasing his knowledge for the perfection 
of himself is respected, why refuse, even independently of all practical considera- 
tions, some knowledge to the great majority of men. In the daily business of life 
how profitable would it not be to the mass of humanity, made up as it is of men in 
their chazacter of workers and of citizens, to participate in the living ideas of their 
times, x 
When the nineteenth century shall render an account of its work to history it can 
not say that its own exclusive work in the domain of popular education has settled all 
social questions. Populareducation is nota panacea. Norisit asedative, asit some- 
times even gives birth to new questions; for, in spite of exceptions that may be named, 
it tends to enfeeble rather than to strengthen the religious sentiments of the masses 
whatever may be the particular form of worship concerned. As popular education 
acts thus because it givesrise to doubt and the spirit of personal investigation, it is 
asked if the school can replace the church in inspiring the soul with the principles of 
morality indispensable to social life. 
Again, the school is intrusted with the duty of forming the intelligences of the 
masses and it should give not only elementary instruction, but should also contribute 
to the making of a manly character and a good citizen. Therefore it is again asked 
whether it is easy to obtain teachers having the qualities which are necessary to 
bring about this double end, and whether the pupils in whom manhood and patriot- 
ism are to be developed are always sufficiently amenable to the instruction necessary 
to accomplish the double end. 
But let us not despair of the future and let us not turn our backs to it because the 
present, like every other historical epoch, presents a mixture of goodand bad. When 
the twentieth century shall have half run its course the people of that age will be 
astonished that the nineteenth century was even able to debate the question of the 
education of the masses, but they will be thankful that it settled that question, while 
democracy, whose advancement the school has aided, willthank the century for what 
it has done. 
MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE SCHOOL, RELIGION, AND THE CHURCH. 
There is evidently a connection between the form of worship practiced by a people 
and its public instruction. In every religion the ministers being concerned especi- 
ally with the needs of the soul, are naturally prompted to ponder upon the subject 
of intellectual development, and they have, speaking generally, more influence than 
any other class of persons in causing schools to be founded and in pursuading par- 
ents to send their children to them. Both the Protestants and the Israelites aro 
usually more advanced than the Catholics in this respect, jusi as the Catholics are 
more advanced than the Greeks, the Mussulmans, and the Buddhists. Almost every- 
where the Israelites establish small churches, the members of which are in the habit
-P-A-G-E-681

of sustaining and supervising their own schools. Among the Protestants it is nec- 
essary that the faithful shall be able to read the Bible in order that each may seek 
in it the basis of his faith and the rule for his conduct, and they place the age of 
confirmation so late in life that the child-is retained in school longer than is the 
case among the Catholics, who, although required to learn the catechism, receive 
their religious instruction principally from the mouth of the priest and their moral 
guidanco in the confessional. Further on it will be seen that with rare exceptions, 
the States which have at least 15 children in school for every 100 inhabitants are 
Protestant or have a majority of Protestants within their borders, while of those 
States which have fewer than 10 children in school for each 100 inhabitants none 
are Protestant. Among peoples professing the Greek religion the most advanced 
nation has only 5} children in school for every 100 inhabitants, Of course this rule 
is not universal and does not apply to the southern portion of the present German 
Empire, nor to Algeria, nor to Lower Canada, while the departments in the east of 
France show that a Catholic people can rival the Protestants in the matter of school 
attendance. 
Before the Reformation, the school in Christian countries was to some extent the 
child of the church; when the church had founded a school, she kept it under her 
control and when some one else had founded an educational institution she invariably 
demanded the right of directing or at least of supervising it. The cause of this 
early subordination of the school to the clergy is this: In the Middle Ages the monks 
(clerks), being almost the only members of society that were educated, were the 
only persons capable of educating others and from that very fact, education tended 
especially to form monks. When Protestantism had divided the Christian world the 
Protestant ‘ministers were compelled to teach the children of their congregations, 
because the reading of the Bible was necessary for the acceptance of the Protestant 
faith just as the Catholic priests for the same reason were compelled to teach the 
catechism. The chief object of education in those times being to make adherents 
to the Christian religion, both sects were solicitous that instruction should not 
deviate from the purpose cach had in view, and for this reason the clergy was 
invested by the civil power with authority over the schools. In very many coun- 
tries, both Catholic and Protestant, the ministers of religion retained this authority 
for a long time after the people had determined that instruction properly so called 
should be the principal aim of the school. Thus, in France, the first minister of 
public instruction was a bishop, but from the time of the restoration of the Bour- 
bons (1815) to that of the third Republic (1875) the question of the authority of the 
Catholic clergy over the public schools was the subject of long and angry debates. 
M. Guizot, who introduced the law of 1833, while minister of public instruction in 
the monarchy of that date, writes in his memoirs these sentences: ‘‘It was upon 
the preponderating and united influence of church and state that I counted in striy- 
ing to found a system of public instruction, yet the dominant fact that opposed my 
efforts both on the floor of the House of Deputies and throughout the country was 
precisely a feeling of mistrust and even of hostility toward both the church and 
state. What was feared for the schools more than anything else, was the influence 
of the priests and the central power.” 
This law of 1833 made a place for the curé both on the communal and on the 
departmental committee. Under the second Republic (1848) the bill of M. Carnot, 
minister of public instruction, made the school entirely lay, though the amendments 
made by the constitutional assembly authorized religious instruction outside of 
school hours. The law of March 15, 1850, however, which was voted under the idea 
that it was necessary to oppose increasing revolutionary ideas by religious influence, 
declared that the public school ought always to be open to the minister of the gospel, 
and assigned an important place to the clergy in the departmental council and in 
the higher council of public instruction. These provisions, however, though they 
were in great part inserted in the law of 1873, were omitted in the law of 1879,
-P-A-G-E-682
  606 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Since 1879 there has been no ccclesiastic either sitting in the ‘councils of instruc- 
tion” or filling the office of inspector. 
Tho law of 1882 has in France removed from the programme of public education 
the subject of religious instruction and has replaced it by instruction in morals and 
civics, has withdrawn from the clergy ali right of inspection and of superintendence 
over schools, whether public or private, and has enacted that religious instruction 
must be given outside of the schoolhouse. These provisions of tho law of 1882 were 
considered by its authors as obligatory upon the Government, because of the compul- 
sory education feature which the law also contained, for though it was proper to 
oblige the parent to educate a child, it is improper to compel it to receive instruc- 
tion in a form of worship not its own. The law of 1882 was completed by the law 
of October 30, 1886, the seventeenth article of which relates that “in the public 
schools of every grade instruction is exclusively intrusted to persons not connected 
with a religious order (exclusivement confié 4 un personnel laique).” In this way 
there have originated in France the public school, compulsory education, free instruc- 
tion, and laic instruction, which is the very programme that the republican party 
had formulated before coming into power. 
But there are other nations which have maintained in their legislation the tutelage 
or superintendence of the ecclesiastical authorities over the schools. Thus, in Spain, 
the law of 1857, still in operation, has expressly stipulated that neither in the public 
nor in the private schools shall the exercise of the right of the bishops to watch over 
religious instruction and the purity of faith and manners be impeached in any way. 
In Russia the parish schools, which form a considerable part of the whole body of 
educational establishments and whose principal aim is ‘‘to strengthen the faith of 
the people,” are under the authority of the Holy Syrod, which also administers 
several other classes of schools, such, for instance, as Sunday schools. It is to be 
observed, however, that tho city schools of Russia are under the minister of public 
instruction and have no sectarian character. 
In Hesse the ministers of the gospel are members of the school council, but neither 
ecclesiastics nor members of a religious order can direct a public school. In Wurtem- 
berg the schools are under the minister of education and worship, and are sectarian, 
and the teacher must be of the faith of the majority of the inhabitants. In Bavaria 
the communal school commission is presided over by the curé or the pastor, and the 
inspector of the district who formerly was in orders is now ordinarily the oldest 
[minister] in tho district. 
In Lutheran Sweden the educational committee in cach district is presided over 
by the pastor of the congregation, and the inspection of the.schools is confided to 
the clergy, but the bishop and the convocation in each diocese inspect the schools 
and annually report to the King. In Norway the bishop and the oldest pastor super- 
vise the schools, in respect to religious instruction, in concert with the school 
director. In Denmark the schools are closely connected with the Lutheran Church, 
In Greece the general supervision of religious instruction and of the moral tenden- 
cies of the schools is lodged in the bishop of the diocese (eparchie), and the nomina- 
tion ef the masters who are to teach religion are confirmed by him. In the Province 
of Quebec, where Catholicism is supreme, though under the monarchy of England, 
which has a state religion of its own, the council of public education, which par- 
takes with a cabinet minister the administration of the schools, is composed of two 
committees, one Catholic and one Protestant, each committee having charge of the 
schools of its own faith. In the Province of Ontario, where Protestantism is 
supreme, the school is called ‘‘unsectarian,” and the religious exercises are limited 
to a prayer and to reading the Bible; but the schools established by the Catholics 
have in certain cases rights which are analogous to those of the public schools. 
Among the greater number of the remaining nations of the world there has been 
for the fifty years last past a very marked movement to separate the school and 
church. In the Dominion of Canada, Manitoba changed in 1890 an educational 
     
-P-A-G-E-683
POPULAR EDUCATION AMONG CIVILIZED NATIONS. 607 
law similar to that of Quebec to one which is detrimental to the interests of the 
Catholic party as far as sectarian schools are concerned. In the United States 
public schools which were [at a very carly date] sectarian have been for a long 
time in every State nonsectarian. Prayer and reading the Bible without comment 
alone are authorized [in a few instances]. Many of the States of the American 
Union have even made this neutrality one of the articles of their constitution. The 
Catholic Church in the United States, however, establishes sectarian schools and is 
striving to secure the adoption of a system analogous in some respects to that which 
is in vogue in Ontario. 
New, South Wales in 1880 suppressed all subsidies to sectarian schools. In Vic- 
toria the school is divorced from the church except to the extent that twice a week 
the session is closed earlier than usual and a minister of the gospel replaces the 
teacher. 
In Europe many States had antedated France in adopting the principle of neutral- 
ity in religious matters as far as concerns the public elementary school. These 
countries are Holland, by the law of 1806, the constitution of 1848, and by the laws 
of 1857 and of 1878; Switzerland by tho federal constitution of 1874, which also 
obliged the parent or guardian in all parts of the republic to educate their children ; 
Austria, by the law of 1869, and Italy, by the law of 1877, which permitted the com- 
munes to eliminate from the school programme the subjects of religious instruction, 
catechism, and sacred history. In Hungary, where Joseph II had already mooted 
this question by his regulations, where also the revolution of 1848 had proclaimed 
nonsectarianism only in turn to be disregarded by the reaction of 1852, the com- 
munal schools must not be made sectarian unless they are under the care of a reli- 
gious or other association. In England the grants of the education department 
are mado only to schools which are open to every child irrespective of religious 
belief, and in which no child shall be called upon to receive instruction in religion 
against the willof the parents. The schools established by the English school board 
by virtue of the law of 1870 are nonsectarian, or at least the Bible is read without 
comment. In Scotland grants are made to schools where the children are not obliged 
to take part in religious instruction. 
In Prussia, where in 1854 religious instruction in the schools became strongly 
entrenched as a result of the reaction against the revolutionary tendencies of the 
era of 1848, the law of March 11, 1872, took away from the ecclesiastical authorities 
the inspection of the schools with which they had previously been endowed, or at 
least narrowed the sphere of that authority to religious instruction merely, while 
giving to the Government the supervision of both public and private schools. Tho 
same provisions are found in Saxony, where an early law had put the school under 
the church, but where also a law of 1873 has reserved to the State the right of inspec- 
tion. It is also the same in the Grand Duchy of Baden, where, after an active oppo- 
sition, the exclusive right of inspection given by the organic law of 1834 to the 
clergy was assumed by the State, and in Bavaria, where the ecclesiastical influence 
has given way twice since 1848 to the authority of the State, the second time in 1866. 
Thus a marked movement of separation or, at least, of emancipation of the school 
from the church has taken place. The school now claims to exist for itself and to 
govern itself by itself. This emancipation has been caused in some Catholic States 
by an opposition to the Catholic Church because the clergy actively engage in poli- 
tics, form a party, and thus provoke a feeling of bitterness in their opponents. 
This antagonism, which is by no means beneficial either in an ethical sense for the 
authority of the clergy nor for the education of the people, has been particularly 
manifest in France. But in the majority of States, especially Protestant States, the 
emancipation has been rather the result of a compromise between the different sects 
than an open hostility to religious worship. It has been recognized that the school- 
master, not being able to teach the dogmas and the ritualism of each church, should 
observe a neutrality which does not imply hostility to the religious sentiment, but 
   
-P-A-G-E-684
608 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
nevertheless gives a disposition to regard the various forms of its manifestation with 
indifference. 
The moral education of the child is one of the principal reasons for the interven- 
tion of the church in management of the school. It is said, ‘‘Without religion no 
morality,” or at least no foundation on which to form and cultivate a true sense of 
morality. This assertion is certainly too absolute, since there are many people who 
are perfectly moral without being faithful adherents of any form of worship; and 
again people who go through religious forms without being secured against 1mmor- 
ality. There have been nations in ancient times, and there are still races in existence, 
who have nothing more than religious superstitions devoid of an ideal, and yet they 
are not deprived of a moral sense in their private life and social relations. Still, 
there is no doubt but the present religions of civilized nations, especially the Christian 
religion, which on the one hand exhibits the divine origin of duty and on the other 
the sanction during life and after of good and eyil actions, are powerful supports to 
morals and the consciousness of duty. To abstain from speaking to children of God, 
of worship, and of duty under pretext of not wishing to interfere with their liberty 
of conscience is not to be truly impartial, because such restraint will allow the tend- 
ency to indifference to implant itseif in the soul. Experience shows that the troubles 
of life are more apt to extinguish religious belief than sceptical indifference is, and 
from this it would appear that a man who has been bred in the belief of his fathers 
is not on that account unable after maturity to discard it. But religious instruction 
of the child and that given under the authority of the church are two distinct things. 
RELATIONS OF PRIMARY INSTRUCTION AND POLITICS. 
“Give mo the school and I shall govern public opinion, and through public opinion 
the state.” Thus many legislators have thought. But by being too absolute in their 
dictum they deceived themselves in as far as they imagined that programmes mold 
the minds no matter what the sentiments of the people may be. They have been 
right in thinking that when these two factors are not in direct opposition educa- 
tion can greatly facilitate and generalize the development of certain ideas, and that 
when education constitutes a national system which is seriously applied it will con- 
tribute in giving the nation greater moral cohesion. It was a political idea that 
inspired the United States when they made great sacrifices in every township, every 
county, and every State in order to train citizens, and the same idea is the cause 
of their redoubled efforts to-day to Americanize the children of immigrants through 
the school. The Swiss Republic, when the Federal constitution imposed compulsory 
school attendance in all cantons, and the French Republic, when it voted the laws of 
1881 and 1882, were both inspired by a political idea of the same nature. It is easy 
to recognize the ties which connect many other organic laws of primary instruction 
with politics: The law of 1833 in France, the law of 1859 in the Sardinian States, 
the law of 1872 in Prussia, and the law of 1868 in Hungary, etc. 
In most countries where the mass of the population has a certain participation in 
the management of public affairs there is a more lively interest in primary instruc- 
tion displayed than under absolute Governments: Switzerland, the United States» 
the Canadian Provinces, and Australasian colonies may serve as examples. But one 
influence may be replaced or paralyzed by others. In Sweden the primary school 
had its beginning during the reign of absolute monarchs and through the aid of 
religious influence; on the other hand, in some Republics of Latin America the 
climate, the divisions which separate the strata of society, the apathy of the Indian 
race, and revolutions have counteracted the effects of a demscracy which is, it must 
be admitted, more nominal than real. 
The colonies which are peopled by the European race rank among the first in 
primary instruction; for example, Algeria, Upper Canada, New Brunswick, New 
South Wales, Victoria, and the United States, all which have the same European 
origin. Perhaps this superiority is dne to that origin; for cmigration and coloniza-

  POPULAR EDUCATION AMONG CIVILIZED NATIONS. 609 
tion presupposes, as a rule, a certain degree of intelligence and energy, and those 
who in this manner create new societies, understanding the value of instruction, 
wish to assure its benefits to their children. There are, no doubt, exceptions to the 
rule. The Slavic race which is pouring itself into America at present disquiets the 
American educators on account of its ignorance, and La Plata, which is principally 
colonized by southern Europeans, counts a large number of illiterates. When a 
colony contains inferior races, as coolies, negroes, ete., like Reunion, the Cape of 
Good Hope, French Guiana, and New Caledonia, then the ignorant preponderate and 
the level of instruction is very low. 
From this it may be concluded that race and climate exercise some influence upon 
primary instruction. It is only the people inhabiting southern Europe or the hot 
countries of South America that have an enrollment in school of fewer than 10 pupils 
for every 100 inhabitants, except in Russia, Finland, and Manitoba, which are labor- 
ing under special climatic and social conditions. The Teutonic race, comprising 
the Scandinavians, Germans, Dutch, and Anglo-Saxons, appears in our day to occupy 
the first rank as far as concerns the development of primary instruction, and it must 
be admitted that these races are mainly Protestant. The Slavic race, and still more 
the Mongolian, are evidently the least advanced races inhabiting Europe. Outside 
of Europe most of the countries that are peopled by half-breeds of Indian and 
Spaniard stock are on a still lower level. 
But the severity of a winter climate is no insurmountable obstacle to instruction, 
asis proved by the Scandinavian States and Canada. During the long months of 
winter, when all agricultural labor must cease, the farmer can send his children to 
the village school or teach them at home, though during the summer, when the stock 
are in the pasture, and especially during the busy days of harvest, the children can 
not be spared. These conditions occur in the most widely separated countries, 
whether it be the United States, or Switzerland, or France. 
It is legitimate to inquire what effect the relatively great wealth of a nation has 
upon the education of its people. As it is necessary to expend constantly very large 
sums in order to educate the whole mass of a nation, it is indisputable that the 
possession of wealth gives great facilities to popular education. The Australasian 
colonies and the United States seem to be the countries where the expenditure is 
largest per capita of population and of attendance at school; but as tho relation of 
the expenditures to the attendance is far from being exact, it is better not to be too 
positive in laying down the rank that each State is entitled to from such data, for 
Switzerland and Scandinavia, although only mederately wealthy, instruct their chil- 
dren well. Certain it is, however, that the absence of pecuniary resources in the open 
country is an obstacle to securing satisfactory schools in such localities, and this 
obstacle is, especially in Russia, one of those that neutralizes the zealous activity of 
educators. If the influence exerted by rich manufacturing industries is inquired 
into, it is found that on the one hand they permit the maintenance of large schools 
well fitted with apparatus and placed in the immediate vicinity of the pupil’s home, 
but that on the other hand the business of the city, the seat of large industries, 
attracts the children by the opportunity of earning money (appt de salaire), thus 
tending to take the pupils at an early hour from the school, and, further, that 
for various reasons the large cities are not always the most favorable places for 
attendance. 
The school serves to instruct youth, but it also propagates ideas that will con- 
stitute the national spirit. This it accomplishes through nearly every branch of 
instruction, especially through the teaching of geography, history, and civics, but 
the most effective work in this line is done by the personality of the teacher. This 
tendency of the elementary school should not be disguised, for it is legitimate. It 
is necessary that in each nation there should exist above the clashing of ideas, of 
classes, and special interests a certain national spirit which binds together the

members of the social body, assuring concord and facilitating the administration of 
public affairs. But in this, as in many other political matters, the good may degen- 
erate into the bad, as when a Government wants to impose its will in some matter 
for which thero is no warrant other than a desire of subversion; for the school may 
in this manner become an instrument of oppression, by aid of which a dominating 
nationality may try to extinguish another nationality. Examples of this are seen in 
Alsace-Lorraine, in Poland, and in other countries. 
The teacher may personally find himself mixed up with politics by becoming a 
kind of political agent—thanks to the relations he has with small cities and with 
the masses of the population. This is a deviation from his proper functions which, 
however seductive it may be to ambition, serves the ends of the master better than 
those of his school. 
But the abuse of an institution should not cause the services which the institution 
renders to be forgotten, for if the sentiment called patriotism is more active and 
more widespread now than formerly, ono is justified in attributing this fact partly, 
indeed, to the wars of the nineteenth century, but partly also to the training which 
the masses of the people have received in the elementary school.

THE SYSTEM IN GENERAL, 
Franco presents the highest type of a centralized, unified State sys- 
tem of education. The form of organization is substantially that of the 
Imperial University established by Napoleon in 1808, and invested with 
the monopoly of teaching throughout the State. The system suited 
admirably the purpose for which it was created, namely, that of making 
a professional service that would furnish careers for subservient talent 
and at the same time afford a channel for the general diffusion of impe- 
rialideas. In maintaining the form of this system, at least as regards 
its main features, the Republic has had also the purpose to infuse into 
it the spirit of liberty and to make it the means of encouraging free 
initiative. This interesting experiment has illustrated in a very strik- 
ing manner the cast and temper of the national genius.
-P-A-G-E-689
    EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 613 
The executive chief of the system is a cabinet officer—the minister of 
public instruction, fine arts, and worship. The portfolio generally 
changes hands with every cabinet crisis,! but the permanency and steady 
progress of the system is not seriously affected thereby, as the directors 
of the three great departments of the system, i. e., primary, secondary, 
and superior, are retained for long periods, and even when changes 
oecur the vacancy is generally filled by the logical successor of the 
departing officer. Thus, after nearly twenty years of service as director 
of primary instruction, M. Ferdinand Buisson? has just been trans- 
ferred to the Sorbonne to fill the chair of pedagogy made vacant by the 
death of M. Henri Marion. The directorship in the ministry is filled 
by the transfer of M. Charles Bayet, who, as rector of the Academy® of 
Lille, has given proof of his adherence to the ideal of the Republic. 
Each of the three great departments is charged with the interests of 
the corresponding grade of education; each has its separate budget and 
distinct body of laws, decrees, ete. The correlation of these separate 
orders is effected through the local or geographical divisions of the 
system. These are academies, seventeen in number, each of which com- 
prises, under the general direction of a rector (appointed by the minis- 
ter), all the schvols, colleges, and faculties (university) of the respective 
districts! The central authority does not hold undivided sway in aca- 
demic districts; within each there is a system of primary schools estab- 
lished by the communes and supported and controlled in part by commu- 
nal funds and authorities; there are also communal colleges or lower 
grade classical schools which are aided by the State, but established and. 
partly controlled by local managers. Above these are the State classical 
colleges (lycées), which, until a very recent date, were rigidly controlled 
by State decrees; and crowning all are the faculties that, as we shall 
presently see, are now transformed into universities. 
The superior council of public instruction is the great deliberative 
head of the State system. Its prototype was the council of the Impe- 
rial University, a body appointed by the grand master and subject to 
his will. The change in the constitution of this council is a striking 
illustration of the movement toward professional liberty which the 
Republic has fostered. Of the sixty members of the present council 
one-fourth only serve by appointment of the President of the Republic; 
the remaining three-fourths are chosen by their peers from the three 
orders of instruction. 
A recent project for the reform of the council proposed the admission 
of members representing interests distinct from education, i. e., the 
¥Lhe present minister is M. Ramband, who succeeded M. Combees April 29, 1896. 
2\M. Buisson’s appointment dates from 1879, Jules Ferry being then minister of education. 
8It will be observed that the word academy is here used in a special sense; it means neither a school 
nor a society of learned men, but a district of educational administration, a division of the State system 
officered by Government appointees. ‘These must, however, be men of approved scholastic attainments; 
thus the academy rector must be a graduate with the doctor's degree. 
“The directorships of superior and secondary instruction are held, respectively, by M. Louis Liard 
and M. Rabier.

departments of justice, commerce, industry, ete.; this project failed, 
but the fact that after thirty years’ discussion the idea has at last been 
submitted to formal debate, indicates that professional exclusiveness will 
find its limits. So far as education is concerned, the present council 
is eminently a representative body, even women who are inspectresses 
of infant schools or directresses of normal schools being eligible to 
membership. 
Nine of the members appointed by the President and six elected 
members constitute a permanent section, which meets every week. 
The entire council holds two annual sessions—one in July, the other in 
December. 
The permanent section deliberates upon matters which are to be sub- 
mitted to the general council, and offers its advice upon the same. 
These matters relate to programmes and regulations for all classes of 
schools, the creation of university courses or facultés, of lycées, and of 
normal schools, the multiplication of chairs, choice of text-books, and, in 
short, to all questions pertaining to studies, administration, discipline, 
and standards which may be submitted by the minister. These questions 
are eventually deliberated in the general council, which prescribes the 
course of instruction in all public schools and determines the condi- 
tions under which private schools may be opened. 
The council is also a final court of appeal from judgments rendered 
by the academic or departmental councils in certain cases of discipline 
or contention. The deliberations of the council are presided over by 
the minister. 
In each “‘académie” there is a council for the assistance of the rector, 
composed of members chosen for the most part by their peers, and 
representing the two higher orders of instruction, to whose interests 
the deliberations of the council are confined. 
Finally, in each department there is a council of primary instruction 
composed of members of the superior council and primary school 
directors, under the presidency of the prefect,! which deliberates, 
advises, and renders judgment in certain matters pertaining to primary 
schools. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF PRIMARY INSTRUCTION—STATE INSPECTION 
OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
The State maintains a very close and intimate inspection of primary 
schools by means of a graded series of inspectors, (1) general inspect- 
ors, including nine assigned to particular sections of the country, sev- 
eral assigned to the oversight of special branches of study, and general 
inspectresses of infant schools. These officials report directly to the 
minister as to the manner in which the educational law is carried out. 
(2) Academic inspectors (inspecteurs d’académie), one for each depart- 
ment, who are subordinate to the rectors. They have the general 
aiteetion: of primary schools, conduct examinations for teachers’ certifi-

cates, appoint all teachers on probation, and name the candidates from 
whom the prefects of departments may appoint full teachers. (3) Pri- - 
mary inspectors, at present about 450 in number, or one for every 150 
primary schools, They inspect the work of individual schools, and 
report to the academic inspector. (4) Medical inspectors, whose duties 
include the examination of children with respect to their physical con- 
dition and of sites and buildings with respect to sanitary particulars, 
COMMUNAL OBLIGATIONS. 
As regards primary schools, however, the initiative of the people is 
enlisted in several ways. The law (1833) makes it obligatory upon 
every commune to establish a public school, which, under the law of 
June 16, 1881, must be a free school and, under laws of 1882 and 1886, 
secular and taught by a lay teacher. A commune, it. must be remem- 
bered, is the simplest civil division in France. Its local affairs are con- 
trolled by a council, and a mayor chosen from the members of the same. 
A commune may have less than 20 inhabitants or it may be a populous 
city. Paris, indeed, is a commune, although differing somewhat from 
others in its form of local government. Large or small, the commune 
must establish a free primary school, provide the site and building, and 
a proportion of the current expenditure; not only so, but every com- 
mune of more than 500 inhabitants must have a separate school for 
girls (laws of March 15, 1850, and April 10, 1867). 
The situation of the communes in these respects as shown by the 
official report for 1894-95,' was as follows: Out of 36,509 communes 
35,582 had established a public school, 841 were united for the purpose 
with adjoining communes, 35 had only a private school, and 51 were 
without schools. The last class, however, are small communes of from 
100 to 200 inhabitants, whose children obtain instruction in neighboring 
districts. 
The general preference for the separate education of boys and girls is 
indicated by the constant increase in the number of communes provid- 
ing a public school for girls. The number having a population of 500 
or upward not making such provision fell from 1,427 in 1891-92 to 1,360 
in 1894-95. 
STATUS OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS AS REGARDS ENROLLMENT, 
The enrollment in primary schools continues to decline from year to 
year, as is shown by the statistics for successive years here presented:

  616 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The decline is slight, only three-tenths per cent from 1891 to 1895, 
but it presents conditions that are alarming. First, the ratio of decline 
is much greater for boys than for girls, five-tenths per cent against four 
hundredths per cent; second, it takes place in public schools only, the 
private schools considered as a whole showing steady gains, as will be 
seen from the following tabulation:

From an inspection of the particulars in the foregoing table it appears 
further that the decline in attendance affected public schools and sec- 
ular private schools, clerical private schools showing steady increase, 
amounting, in the four years reviewed, to 5 per cent. 
As regards the decline in the enrollment of boys, M. Buisson, in his 
comment upon the figures, expresses the belief that they contain some 
hidden error which the statistical commission! may yet discover. Spe- 
cial investigation of this point will be made and the results published 
in the next quinquennial report. 
The enrollment in the primary schools, as given above, 5,540,095, is 
equivalent to 14.4 per centof the population.” The enrollment, 714,734, 
in maternal or infant schools, that is for children 2 to 6 years of age, may 
properly be added.to the above, as these are also under State super- 
vision and partly supported by the State. This would give a general 
total of 6,254,829 pupils; 73 per cent of this total, viz, 3,452,764 pupils 
in the primary and 118,456 in the infant schools, were of the obligatory 
school ages—that is, 6 to 13 years. This total is 87.2 per cent of the 
entire number of children of the ages specified. If Algiers be omitted, 
.the proportion for France alone is 96.5 per cent. The very small num- 
ber of children of the legal school age, 156,000, not found within the 
schools bears witness to the vigilance of teachers and school officers. 
Ié should be noted also that the preparatory departments of secondary 
schools receive many children of legal school age—in 1891-92 their 
rolls showed 64,413, 
  
!'This commission was constituted in tho ministry of public instruction and fine arts in 1876 and 
has issued altogether five reports. ‘he chief of the commission is the distinguished statistician and 
writer upon economics, M. E. Levasseur. 
2This ratio is absolutely less than the corresponding ratio of neighboring countries, in Germany 
and England, for example, where it is 17 per cent, but it must be remembered that the child popula- 
tion of France bears a smaller ratio to the total population than in neighboring countries.
-P-A-G-E-693
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 617 
The superior primary schools which correspond to high schools of this 
country are included in these estimates. The public schools of this 
grade had an enrollment of 47,397 pupils, an increase of 13 per cent in 
four years. The private schools of the same grade had the enrollment 
of 56,051. 
THE TEACHING SERVICE. 
The primary schools employed 150,913 teachers, of whom 105,162 
were in public and 45,751 in private schools. In maternal schools 
there were 9,199 teachers, all women. The following table shows the 
classification of the teachers of the primary schools with respect to 
their qualifications as indicated by the diploma obtained:

aMany of these have the bachelor's degree. 
The increase in the number of public-school teachers provided with 
the full diploma above the number in 1891-92 is 5,753 (2,388 men, 3,365 
women). The number having no diploma has diminished by 1,669 in 
the same time. 
In view of the number of teachers in charge of a school (viz, 67,380 
in public schools), it is interesting to note the number of pupils to a 
school. 
In this respect the classification of the 102,506 schools was as follows:

Having 71 to 80 pupils . 0.7 
More than 80 pupils. ... .3 
It appears also that there were 7,271 schools enrolling less than 20 
pupils. 
The number of pupils seeking the ¢ertificate of elementary primary 
studies steadily increases. In 1895 there were 233,806 candidates 
ED 96 20*   
 
-P-A-G-E-694
  618 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
(128,181 boys, 105,625 girls), as against a total of 228,170 in 1892. Of 
the number presented for examination, 185,467 obtained the certificate 
in 1895 (175,675 in 1892). Pupils may offer themselves for the examina- 
tion at 1llyearsof age. The certificate procures exemption from further 
attendance at the elementary schools and aiso admits the holder to the 
superior primary school. The certificate for superior primary schools 
is also sought by an increasing number of pupils, 3,359 in 1895 against 
3,049 in 1892. The number of certificates of this grade delivered in 
1895 was 2,035; in 1892 only 1,850. 
The normal schools for elementary teachers belong also to the depart- 
ment of primary instruction; these in 1895-96 enrolled 7,856 students, 
3,930 men, 3,926 women. 
Evidences of the good results of the instruction obtained in the 
schools are afforded by the decline of illiteracy among conscripts. The 
proportion able to read and write, which was 92.2 per cent in 1892, had 
risen to 94.2 in 1895, 
SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS AND FUNDS IN AID OF POOR CHILDREN. 
The use of school savings banks (caisses d’épargne scolaires) as a 
means for teaching thrift is apparently not increasing, the number of 
banks having fallen from 19,826 in 1893 to 17,793 in 1895, and the num- 
ber of depositors from 419,896 to 410,188. The amount deposited, how- 
ever, increased in the same time from $2,589,050 to $2,597,068. There 
is also apparently a slight diminution in the number of communes 
maintaining funds in aid of poor children (caisses des écoles). The 
number of such funds was 15,893 in 1895 against 16,121 in 1893. The 
receipts and disbursements, however, show inerease in the same time, 
the former from $1,032,612 to $1,061,334; the latter from $804,255 to 
$871,390. 
FINANCES. 
The current expenditure for public: primary schools (including the 
elementary and superior primaries) reached the following totals for 
the years specified : 
1892 .. 
1893 .. $34, 254, 839 
5, 002, 400 
37, 048, 012 
This expenditure is divided between the State and the communes, 
the ratio borne by each having been the same for the three years, viz, 64 
per cent for the State, 36 per cent for the communes. 
The expenditure for primary normal schools not included in the above 
amounted in 1894 to $1,780,900 borne by the State. The State not only 
bears the largest part of the expense of primary instruction, but, except- 
ing in the large cities, is the animating impulse and controlling author- 
ity in respect to courses of study, qualification of teachers, and standards 
of exmination. This comes about very naturally among a people long

accustomed to take their educational direction from an ecclesiastical 
hierarchy. Evidences of the growing interest of communes, however, 
seems to be afforded by the increased funds which they contribute for 
optional expenses.

the contributions of the communes under the head specified have been—

DEPARTMENT OF SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
To the department of secondary instruction belong the lyeées (State 
classical colleges), 107 in number, established and maintained by the 
State with the cooperation generally of the cities in which they are 
located, and the communal colleges, numbering 235, an inferior grade 
of classical school established by communal authorities with the aid of 
the State. No recent statistics of this department have been published. 
The latest will be found in the general table on page 612. 
THE LYCKE IDEAL AND ATTEMPTED MODIFICATIONS. 
The lycée course embodies the French ideal of liberal culture. “It 
is in the lycée,” says M. Bréal, “that the élite of our youth, magistrates, 
administrators, officers, diplomats, authors, receive all the general 
instruction that they will carry into life. In them is accomplished the 
apprenticeship of mind, and it may be said in advance that whatever gaps 
and deficiencies exist in secondary instruction will show themselves in the 
intellectual life of the nation.”! Because of this relation peculiar impor- 
tance attaches to all efforts for the modification of the general conduct, 
the course of study, and the official recognition of these typical institu- 
tions. No problem before the superior council of public instruction has 
occupied more time or given rise to more serious efforts than that of the 
scope and adjustment of the lycée course. Some important changes 
were effected in the method of classical instruction by the new pro- 
grammes of 1890, but the composition of the course and the predomi- 
nance given to Latin show the tenacity of the old conception of liberal 
education. The modern course introduced as “enseignement secondaire 
spécial” in 1865 by M. Duruy was changed in name, ‘“‘moderne” being 
substituted for “spécial,” and also rendered more scholarly or less utili- 
tarian by a decree of 1891. As to the effect of these changes no official 
report has yet been made. 
‘The plan of a trifurcated course and a triple baccalaureate introduced 
also by M. Duruy in 1865 was abandoned under the decree of 1890 and 
a single bachelor’s degree adopted. ‘The course was made uniform for 
all students of the fall or classical division up to the last year, i. e., 
philosophy, when options are allowed. According to the choice made

the successful candidate has his diploma inscribed: “Lettres, philo- 
sophie;” “Lettres, mathématiques,” or ‘Lettres, sciences physiques et 
naturelles.” 
A proposition to abandon the baccalaureate altogether has recently 
been submitted to the superior council. The present minister of public 
instruction is opposed to the measure in this extreme form but favors 
the substitution of a leaving examination similar to the ‘“‘ Abiturienten- 
- Examen” of the German gymnasia. This movement appears to have 
two motives, one to lessen the distinction now existing between the clas- 
sical and the modern course, the other to change somewhat the relation 
of the lycée course to the general scheme of State education. As we 
have already stated, the province of the lycées has been to deter- 
»mine the tone and provide the means of liberal culture for the élite of 
the nation. All higher institutions are for special study. It has long 
been recognized that the French system needed to be deepened and 
extended as regards provision for general study. With the development 
of the university idea the disposition to make liberal culture the work of 
the faculties of letters and of science has increased. The present move- 
ment tends in that direction and excites naturally intense opposition 
from those who fondly cherish the traditional system. It is impossible 
at this moment to forecast the outcome. The lycées are not secondary 
. schools in the American sense of the word; they correspond rather to 
our colleges, and they hold the devotion of their graduates by the 
memory of all the delightful associations which cluster around the word 
“alma mater.” The State has strengthened the tie by turning the 
public exercises of the lyeées into an imposing and brilliant ceremony. 
The characteristic ceremony is the annual competition of lycée 
students held at Paris. An account of this public festival, for such it 
is, with an intimate view of lycée work, written by Dr. Alcée Fortier,! 
is appended to this chapter, and may fittingly close the review of this 
division of the French system. From this letter it will be seen that 
the system has a repressive influence, which increases the difficulty of 
getting new ideas into practical operation. 
DEPARTMENT OF SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
In the department of superior instruction important movements have 
been going on during the past decade which have been explained in the 
recent reports of the Commissioner of Education. They have tended, 
all, to the gradual transformation of the State faculties into autonomous 
universities, and their culmination is the law that passed the lower 
Chamber in May and the Senate in August of the present year (1896), 
giving the faculty groups the legal title of university. The law is here 
cited, together with extended extracts from the speeches made in the 
Senate, which explain the full purport of the measure and show its 
relation to previous measures in the series.

The Senate in its session of July 7, 1896, upon a resolution of urgency, 
adopted by a vote of 291 against 31, the project of law relative to the 
constitution of the universities. 
The following is the text of the law: 
ArticLe 1. The corps of faculties instituted by the law of April 26, 1893, shall be 
called universities. 
Art. 2, The council general of the faculties (i. e., of each faculty group) shall be 
called the council of the university. 
Art. 3. The council of the university is substituted for the academic council? in 
the consideration of disputed and disciplinary matters pertaining to superior public 
instruction. 
Art, 4, From the date, January 1, 1898, the required fees for courses, registration, 
use of library and laboratories, paid by the students, shall be retained by the 
respective universities.? 
These funds can be applied to the following objects only: Expenditure for labora- 
tories, libraries, and collections; construction and furnishing of buildings; estab- 
lishment of new courses of instruction; equipments for the advantage of the 
students. 
Tho fees for examination, for certificates of aptitude (certifying that the candidate 
has passed the cxaminations required for a diploma), fees for “visa” (that is, signa- 
tures upon duplicate diplomas) paid by candidates for the degrees or titles recognized 
by law, as also the fees for ‘dispense ” (that is, exemption from the customary term 
of study), and for equivalence (i. e., recognition of foreign diplomas) will continue 
to be collected into the public treasury. : 
The law met with opposition from those who desired complete auton- 
omy for the individual universities and those who are opposed to any 
innovations upon the existing system. Even among those who voted 
in favor of the measure there were signs of discontent with its provi- 
sions, particularly with the recognition accorded to incomplete faculty 
groups—that is, having less than four distinct faculties. The minister 
of public instruction, M. Rambaud, made an eloquent speech in defense 
of the project. The epitome of the minister’s address here presented 
comprises his principal arguments in favor of the measure. 
Referring to the history of the university bill which, in one form or 
another, has been before the legislature since 1890, M. Rambaud recalled 
a succession of ministers who had been pledged to its support—M. Ber- 
thelot, M. Fallieres, M. Wallon, and others. Its purpose he declared 
was to give life to higher instruction. Following the advice of Jules 
Ferry, its friends had proceeded without precipitation or recklessness. 
From the foundation of the third Republic the most urgent reforms 
had been first considered. * * * For more than thirty years, from 
the ministry of Victor Duruy to that of Jules Simon, the faculties had 
suffered chiefly from the want of suitable equipment. This miserable 
condition has been overcome. One by one the buildings have been 
reconstructed, laboratories equipped, libraries supplied. The teaching 
personnel has been reenforced and increased, the audiences of hearers

have gradually been replaced by veritable students, and thus life has 
been imparted to the poor and isolated faculties. 2 
The beginning of this development, which has culminatea in the 
present project, was the inquiry ordered by M. Jules Ferry. One of 
his successors, belonging to a different political school, M. Goblet, has 
collected together the results of this inquiry; it is he also who counter- 
signed the decrees of July 251 and December 28, 1885;? these decrees 
were followed by a law of July 18, 1889, regulating ene finances, after 
which came a new decree, February 22, 1890,° then a new financial law, 
that of April 18, 1893, and finally the decrees of August 9 and 10, 
countersigned by M. Poincaré. 
Thus nothing has been left to hazard or to chimerical notions. Prog- — 
ress has taken the experimental course. That is to say, the effort has 
been to create a condition before giving ita name. This method has 
been justified by its practical success, and first and chiefly by the con- 
stantly increasing number of students in the schools of higher instruc- 
tion depending upon the minister of public instruction. In 1885 the 
total number of students was 16,579. In December, 1895, it was 25,887. 
This great increase has not had the effect of overcrowding the Paris 
faculties. All the faculties of France have shared in the advantage, 
the provincial faculties even in larger measure than those of the cap- 
ital. 
The minister quoted from a table which showed that while the rate 
of increase in the total number of students from 1885 to 1896 was 60 
per cent, the ratio at Paris was only 37 per cent. The faculties of the 
provinces greatly exceed this rate. Besancon has seen its student 
population increase in the time by 103 per cent—that is, more than 
double. It is nearly the same at Aix, Bordeaux, Dijon, Nancy, Poitiers, 
Rennes, where the rate varies from 89 to 95 per cent. At Lille, Lyons, 
Montpellier, the increase is still higher, from 103 to 119 per cent. Thus, 
as regards students, a veritable decentralization has been going on. 
This increase in the student population of the provinces is in direct 
proportion to the hopes that these university groups have founded upon 
the pending bill. 
Referring to the charge of a critic who had declared, “If we have 
many students it is because we pay students to be instructed, which is 
done only in France, the minister said: 
There is great exaggeration in both of these statements. What is the total num- 
ber of scholarships offered by the French BES, in the faculties of letters and of

hold property, receive gifts, and manage their own estates.

common funds, ete. ‘The same decree constituted a council of each faculty composed of the titular 
or full professors and an assembly of eavh faculty comprising full professors and agrégés (fellows). 
‘The functions of the former pertained to the general affairs of the faculty, and of tho latter to scho- 
lastie work.

science, for the question only arises with respect to these? There are no scholarships 
cither in the faculties of law orin those of medicine. The total number is at present 
871, anumber small indeed, it must be admitted, in comparison with the number of 
students in letters and science, which is 6,000. 
Now, why have we these scholarship funds? It is because they are demanded by 
tho service. We do not pay young men to study in order to fill up the benches 
before the professors; but we need them for the recruitment of the teaching force 
of secondary schools. Observe that this total of 371 scholarships in letters and 
science furnishes each year from 80 to 100 candidates for the professorships of second- 
ary instruction. In respect to letters particularly this number is quite insufficient. 
Without doubt the free students, by the increase of their numbers and of their 
knowledge, have furnished us a most valuable source of recruitment. In propor- 
tion as these free elements have been supplied the credits demanded from Parlia- 
ment for the scholarship funds have been diminished. Since 1888 (when the total 
amount allowed under this head was $144,000) there has been a decrease of about 
$40,000. The present year the amount is reduced by about $6,000. 
And when it is asserted that France is the only country where they pay young 
men to be instructed, I respond that this same thing is done notably in Germany ; 
but in Germany it is not soreadily apparent, because there students are not supported 
solely by State appropriations, but partly also by endowments. 
In the Empire of Russia, if you wish to make comparison, you will find that the free 
students are nearly one-third the entire number in the Russian universities, So much 
for the declaration that ‘‘this is done only in France.” 
As another evidence of the success of the late reform, the minister 
noted the increase in the number of foreign students in the French 
faculties. In January, 1896, the total had reached 1,828. The largest 
proportions were furnished by Russia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Roumania, 
and Greece; that is to say, by countries in which the equipment for 
superior instruction is meager, and hence they come to take, as it were, 
“the watchword from I’rench science.” 
M. Rambaud noted further that even among the scientific representa- 
tives of the older countries with richly endowed universities there is 
heard unmistakable expressions of admiration for the work accom- 
plished in France. 
As to the reproach of opponents of the proposed bill, that it confers 
nothing more than a name upon existing institutions, M. Rambaud 
reminded his hearers that there are names that create the things 
named. Hence the Latin saying, “Nomina numina.” The institution 
which is a university in all but the name, lacks Jegal existence in its 
true character. Herein is the value of the name. It stands for an 
important and imposing idea, the universality of science, or, as ex- 
pressed by Father Didon, “the true higher learning in its liberty, its 
universality, and its unity.” 
As to the objection urged in some quarters that it is a vain endeavor 
to seek to unite in general councils professors teaching subjects so 
unlike as science and law, as letters and medicine, M. Rambaud 
reminded his hearers that all the reforms already accomplished have 
been the outcome of conferences between the minister of public instruc- 
tion and the general councils of the faculties, especially that of the 
faculties of Paris. To such collaboration is due the late measure 
 
-P-A-G-E-700
624 | EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
obliging students of medicine to pass one year in a faculty of science 
to acquire general scientific culture, the reform of the “license és sci- 
ences” (degree of licentiate in science), which gives recognition to 
important specialties, the reform of the doctorate of law, ete. 
To cite these is sufficient to dispose of the objection that professors 
of different branches united in conference do not speak the same lan- 
guage and are incapable of understanding each other. 
The minister advocated the university idea particularly as tending 
to correct the extreme professional bias. 
“Universities,” he said, “by the general character of their instruc- 
tion, counteract the professional weakness (tare) among those who 
practice the liberal professions. They enable specialists to acquire 
easily that general knowledge which, even in respect to the speciality 
itself, constitutes the real value and originality of the man.” 
As to the criticism that the measure is opposed to the development 
of specialties demanded in the various localities, the minister showed 
that these have been strengthened as the university idea has grown. 
He said: 
At Bordeaux, besides the general instruction given in the faculty of sciences, there 
has been created a laboratory of industrial chemistry specially devoted to the re- 
searches pertaining to the culture of the vine and the industries depending thereupon. 
To this laboratory is to be credited the remedy for mildew. At Lyons, the center of 
the silk and dyeing industries, there has been created achair of industrial chemistry 
whose incumbent devotes himself to experiments in dyeing. Every year he sends out 
thirty or forty students, who go forth to apply in the local manufactories the knowl- 
edge acquired in the faculty. At Nancy, the center at once of agriculture and of 
brewing, the endeavor has been to meet the double demands of the region. Hencea 
chair of agricultural chemistry and a brewing laboratory, so that in the subsoil of 
the faculty of sciences model beers, ideal beers, are elaborated, which become tho 
standards for the neighboring breweries. At Lille there is found a course in industrial 
chemistry and agriculture and a course in industrial physics. It is understood that 
physics can be made equally with chemistry the precious auxiliary of industry. I 
can not enumerate all the chairs, all the courses of agriculture or industrial chemistry. 
They are found in nearly all our university centers, and always adapted to the local 
demands. At Caen there exists as an annex to the faculty of sciences a laboratory 
particularly valuable in a seacoast and fishing place, namely, a laboratory of mari- 
time zoology. At Besangon, center of manufactures and of clock making, we havea 
professor of chronometric science and an observatory of chronometry. 
So much for the faculties of science. They are inspired with the ideas appropri- 
ate to each section of France; they have sought to meet the demands of trade, and 
beside the general instruction which is their province they have founded this special 
instruction. 
The same is true of the faculties of letters. At Bordeaux there is a chair of the 
history of the southwest; at Nancy, a chair of the history of the east of France; at 
Lille, a chair of the languages and the literature of Picardy, and of the Wallons, 
and a chair of the Russian language and literature. Why the Russian language? 
Because that this region, from the seventeenth century, from the time of the forma- 
tion of the ‘Company of the North” by Colbert, has been in relations with Russia 
through Dunkirk. 
At Aix there is a chair of Provengal literature; at Rennes, a course in Celtic lan- 
guage and literature; at Toulouse, a chair of the history of the middle region of 
France, and a chair of the Spanish language and literature; at Grenoble, a course
-P-A-G-E-701
    EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 625 
in Italian literature; at Caen, a chair of Norman literature and art; at Poitiers and 
at Clermont, chairs consecrated to the history of the province. But all this does 
not prevent tho teaching of the same chemistry at Lyons as at Bordeaux. 
The movement toward these varied creations appears to me very wise because it 
tends to attach the faculties to the region in the center of which they are installed; 
because it will naturally lead them to loye it and will result in their finding in the 
sympathies of the region, in the liberality of citizens justly proud of their little 
provincial possession, inexhaustible resources. This will enable them, thanks to the 
freedom which this law imparts, to develop tho special local features of their work. 
In effect they will henceforth only be limited in respect to those matters that con- 
cern the obligatory courses of a general character. 
It should be observed further that the funds for the greater part of these chairs, 
these courses, laboratories, and observatories, which I have just enumerated, have 
been furnished, either in whole or at least one-half, by the cities, departments, or 
sometimes the regions. 
Having thus disposed of the objection that the interests of special 
instruction would suffer from the new law, the minister proceeded to 
consider its effect upon the national character of the institutions. 
The possibility of this character he illustrated by the German uni- 
versities, to which he paid a noble tribute as “vigorous factors in the 
national evolution” and “the incarnation of the national idea.” 
In replying to certain objections against the law the minister found 
occasion to contrast the ideal of the newly constituted universities with 
that of the old universities, and also with that of the Imperial creation. 
Only the principal points of contrast dwelt upon are here summarized. 
So far as possible that is done by verbatim citations. 
In the universities of the Middle Ages theology held first place. The new univer- 
sities ‘“‘will be, above all, secular and free.” 
The old institutions were essentially “international.” ‘The University of Paris 
in the thirteenth century was as much foreign as French; that is to say, the students 
of foreign countries, those who were divided into ‘nations,’ English, German, Flem- 
ish, were perhaps more numerous than the French.” But in the university of to-day 
the national character predominates, and the end to which their instruction is 
directed is national. In the old universities the separation between the different 
orders of instruction, between theology and law, between law and medicine, were 
strongly marked. They had no internal unity. Now, itis precisely the establishment 
of this internal unity that is sought in the proposed reform. 
The universities of the Middle Ages, and this should be particularly noted, were 
poorly endowed. The professors refused to accept new colleagues in order to secure 
for themselves all the revenues of the corporation, all the profits from tuition fees. 
We have the spectacle in the seventeenth century of such a university, that of 
Bourges, reduced to be the fief of a father-in-law supported by his son-in-law. 
It is precisely because of poverty that the French universities have given nothing 
to the Middle Ages and to modern times, ‘because it is impossible to accomplish any- 
thing for science without instruments and without material. Now, we desire, as is 
well known, universities amply endowed to fulfill the mission that we propose to 
confide to them. 
We desire for our universities modern manners as well as modern studies. Between 
the universities of the Middle Ages and those of to-day there is nothing in common}; 
nothing excepting the name; nothing apart from the idea, always just, that those who 
desire to study should associate themselves together. 
We realize that science being so extensive professors ought to devote more time to 
their students, to become their intimate collaborators. We realize also that science

  626 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
being so vast in its variety, and each of its divisions and subdivisions forming in 
itself a science, it requires ample equipments, and a numerous teaching body, and 
for this work the resources of an association united to those of the State are none tco 
great. 
In considering the objections of those who hold that the new measure 
is contrary to the spirit of the French Revolution, the minister showed 
that the charge is unfounded, first, as regards the instruction proposed. 
This is to be general in its nature, encyclopedic as it were; but “the 
encyclopedia is the very essence of the eighteenth century itself,” “it 
is the French Revolution itself.” 
The work of the lyeée, as proposed by Mirabeau, was “to teach let- 
ters, sciences, and arts.” Condorcet defined the lycées as “ establish- 
ments where all the sciences will be taught in their whole extent.” 
How does this differ, asks the minister, from the universities proposed 
by the new law? “This idea of the lycée,” he says, “ this university 
idea, that is not of special schools, but of schools for general knowl- 
edge, was discussed during the entire period of the Convention, and 
among its advocates are to be found Romme, one of the authors of the 
revolutionary calendar, Lepeletier de Saint-Fargeau, and Robespierre.” 
The reaction against this university idea, according to the minister, 
was the work of the Consulate and the Empire. Napoleon was devoted, 
and that in an ever-increasing degree, to special schools. The cause is 
easily understood, for they met his immediate and pressing demands 
for officers, magistrates, engineers, and doctors. 
As to the faculties that he created—that is, the 27 faculties of letters 
and the 27 of science—“ this apparent luxury of provision was in reality 
only poverty and weakness.” The faculties of Napoleon were recruited 
from the neighboring lycées (not the lycée of Condorcet, but that of 
to-day, which is also a creation of Napoleon). The professors of the 
higher classes of the lycées constituted in effect the faculties of letters 
and of science, and the “ proviseur,” or principal, of the lycée was the 
dean of the faculty. 
And moreover the faculties thus constituted were simply examining 
juries. 
There were, it is true, illustrious professors—in the faculties of Paris, many cele- 
brated and glorious. Some such might be mentioned in the provinces also; but this 
does not obscure the fact that the general state of superior instruction was that of 
mediocrity and sterility. 
In contrast with this conception of higher instruction, comprising on the one hand 
special schools intended to supply candidates for certain professions necessary to the 
State and on the other isolated faculties having no proper being, stands out the lib- 
eral conception of 1789 in respect to education, the encyclopedic conception embodied 
in what were called lycées in the time of Condorcet and in what are to-day called 
universities. 
‘While from some quarters it had been urged that the proposed uni- 
versities would have too much liberty, from others the complaint was 
heard that they would not have enough. The minister observed that 
the two objections refuted each other. For himself he disclaimed any
-P-A-G-E-703
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 627 
desire to repress their free development. “TI believe,” he said, “that it 
is the essence of a republican State, developing in all directions the 
consequences of its own principle, to put freedom everywhere together 
with universality; not alone in letters and in science, but also in the - 
arts.” 
The actual innovations made by the law into the existing system as 
explained by the minister relate to finances and programmes. 
The universities will have the full control of part of their funds, with 
respect to others they will have a determining voice, and for the rest 
they will be limited to the mere privilege of giving advice or opinions. 
It will be the same with the programmes of study. These will com- 
prise'portions obligatory upon the universities, because they correspond 
to the examinations and decrees prescribed by the State; but there 
will also be a wide margin for free options. From the funds which will 
belong to the universities and which for the most part will be provided 
by benefactions at their own disposal, the universities may create 
whatever instructions they desire, courses in Egyptology, in Assyri- 
ology, but they can not restrict the courses which the State judges to 
be necessary and which are maintained by the funds of the State. 
As to the general reorganization of public instruction, the law makes 
no changes. There will still be a rector at the head of each academy. 
Above the council general of each university there will be the superior 
council with its permanent section; the professors and “agrégés” (asso- 
ciated professors or fellows) will be appointed; the project of law voted 
exactly as at present. Although appointments to professorships are 
made by the President, upon the advice of the minister, this is now 
scarcely more than a form, since the choice of the minister is greatly 
restricted. “There are not many countries,” said M. Rambaud, “where 
the minister upon the presentation on the one side of the faculty inter- 
ested and on the other of the permanent section is obliged to appoint 
the person whose name heads the list.” 
All things considered, the future universities will be as independent 
as the German universities. The only restriction imposed upon the 
former relates to the programmes. This is explained by the difference 
between the French diplomas and the German. 
The new project, far from destroying the University of France, will, 
in the opinion of the minister, give it a higher value. It will also 
have the effect of drawing benefactions into the treasuries of the new 
universities. 
Already, under the impulse of the recent movements, bequests to the 
amount of $600,000 have been received from private sources. Mont- 
pellier has been unusually favored in this respect, having received 
$300,000 in a single legacy. At Paris two chairs have been privately 
endowed, one of the history of the French Revolution and a second by 
the Count de Chambrun of the history of economic doctrines. 
The minister was followed by M. Louis Liard, director of superior

628 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
instruction, who confined himself chiefly to the statistics pertaining to 
his department. The following are the principal facts brought out in 
his statement. 
From 1884 to 1895 there was a notable decrease in the public expend- 
iture for superior instruction. The State appropriations in the former 
year were $2,310,471. In 1895 they were $2,628,415, but during the 
same time the receipts from fees increased from $781,200 to $1,326,400; 
that is, while the expenditure increased by $300,000 thereceipts increased 
by $540,000. 
During the same period the net expenditure for a student declined, 
being $109 in 1884 and only $54 in 1895. In no country, said M. Liard, 
not even omitting Germany, does a student cost less. 
Tor the purpose of comparison with the resources of the French uni- 
versities, M. Liard submitted the following statement as to German 
universities. The total receipts he gave in round numbers as $4,740,000, 
derived as follows: From endowments and revenues, $600,000; from 
fees for courses, examinations, and matriculation, $540,000; subvention 
from the State, $3,600,000. In France, if the amounts received during 
the year by the establishments of superior instruction and which are 
turned into the treasury be subtracted from the State appropriations 
for the same, it will be found that the net cost to the State has been 
only $1,301,825. 
It is desirable to note further that the net cost of a student is 271 
francs ($54). In Germany the net cost to the State—that is, after deduc- 
tion of the university revenues—is 645 francs ($129). It may be noted 
further that the expenditure for a university student per capita of the 
population is in Switzerland from 96 centimes to 1 franc (19 to 20 cents), 
varying in different cantons; in Germany it is 37 centimes (7 cents), 
in France it is only 16 centimes (3 cents). 
Far from being excessive, as some have urged [said the director], the contribution 
from the State is actually insufficient. Take, for example, the budget of the Paris 
faculty of medicine, which comprises more than 4,000students. The budget is consid- 
erable, but divided between the varied and important services, consider how small 
the appropriation for each. For the chemical laboratory only 5,215 francs ($1,043) 
per annum; for the physical laboratory a sum total of 1,460 francs ($292) ; the labor- 
atory of histology, 2,020 francs ($404); the laboratory of anatomy, 1,250 francs 
($250) ; that of therapeutics, 2,015 francs ($403); that of legal medicine, 1,720 franes 
($344); of hygiene, 2,470 francs ($494); that of surgery, 1,190 francs ($238); that of 
comparative and experimental pathology, 2,470 francs ($494). This is pitiable. 
I will now give the sums allowed for materials for each of the clinies of the Paris 
faculty of medicine. These are also mere pittances; no other word can beused. The 
medical clinic of the Hétel Dieu receives 1,930 franes ($386); the surgical clinic, 1,200 
francs ($240); the medical clinic of the ‘‘Charity,” 1,610 francs ($322); the surgical 
clinic of the same hospital, 1,720 francs ($344); the medical Clinic of the ‘Pitié,” 
790 francs ($158); the surgical clinic, 1,190 francs ($238). 
The situation is nearly the same for the faculty of sciences at Paris. You know 
the éclat that this faculty has imparted to superior instruction and the discoveries 
by which it has contributed to the progress of science. Well, the appropriations 
for the laboratories, for the cost of instruction in this faculty, which comprises 25
-P-A-G-E-705
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 629 
experimental branches, is only 60,000 franes ($12,000) ; that is, about 2,400 francs ($480) 
for cach. 
The Bordeaux faculty of sciences, which has 10 experimental branches, receives only 
14,500 franes ($2,900); that is, about 1,450 francs ($290) each. That of Lille, for 11 
experimental branches, receives 15,550 francs ($3,110), or on the average 1,400 francs 
($280) for each. The same penury for the libraries. The university libraries have been 
constructed and already well furnished, but how meager their budgets, especially by 
comparison. 
Compare, for example, Strasburg and Nancy. . Strasburg receives annually for the 
material of its library 72,500 francs ($14,500); Nancy only 21,625 frances ($4,325) ; 
Géttingen, which may be compared with Lyons, received 55,887 franes ($11,177); 
Lyons only 24,000 ($4,800); Halle has 30,000 franes ($6,000) and Poitiers 11,750 franes 
($2,350). 
M. Liard called attention further to what has become a matter of 
absolute dishonesty in the financial system. 
The students pay certain fees annually for the use of libraries, laboratory facili- 
ties, etc. These sums are turned into the publie treasury. As the number of stu- 
dents increases the product of the fees increases also, and since the State appropria- 
tions are not proportionately augmented, it follows that a part of the income from 
fees goes to the profit of the State instead of to the benefit of the institution and the 
students. 
For example, at the Paris faculty of medicine the student is charged 50 francs 
($10) for the use of laboratory the first year and 40 francs ($8) for the second and 
third year each. 
In making up the balance between the funds from these fees which are thus 
received into the treasury and the appropriations allowed by the State for the same 
purpose, it appears that by reason of the increase in the number of students the 
resources of the faculty are actually reduced by an average amount of 21 francs, 34 
centimes ($4.26) per student. 
It is the same with the superior school of pharmacy, and with all the faculties 
where practical work is maintained. One of the most important of all the faculties 
is that of medicine and pharmacy at Lyons; the number of students who took part 
in the practical works in 1895 was 1,065. The amount allowed for these works in 
the budget of public instruction was 19,350 francs ($3,870) or 18 francs 17 centimes 
($3.63) per student, but the amount turned into the treasury from the fees paid by 
the students on account of the experimental work averages 45 frances ($9) each. 
The same thing occurs with respect to the libraries. Each student pays a library 
fee of 10 francs ($2) per annum. At Paris, in 1895, the total receipts from this source 
were 63,200 franes ($12,640). The appropriations from tho State for the university 
library and for the libraries of the faculties of medicine, of theology, of law, and 
of the superior school of pharmacy, collectively, for the purchase of volumes and 
for subscriptions, were only 45,900 francs ($9,180). It is fully recognized that this 
is an injustice that ought not to be tolerated, and for this reason, among others, the 
new law has been submitted, which will put an end to these abuses after January, 
1898. 
Under this law the State will continue its appropriations as heretofore, but after 
the law goes into operation each university will retain the laboratory fees, library 
fees, and fees for courses as expressed in article 4. 
REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION TO THE FRENCH FAOCULTI&S. 
The Report of the Commissioner for 1894-95 contained an account of 
important efforts for facilitating the admission of American students to 
university privileges in France. The initiatory impulse to this move- 
 
-P-A-G-E-706
  630 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
ment was given by Professor Furber, of Chicago, who met with an 
immediate and cordial response from the ministry of public instruction 
and the university professors of France. A committee of university 
men was formed under the name of the “Committee Franco-American,” 
to promote the object, and. subsequently an advisory committee was 
organized in the United States under the presidency of Prof. Simon 
Newcomb. Concessions were secured immediately respecting admis- 
sion to the faculty of science, as explained in the previous report. The 
following paper, for which the office is indebted to M. Paul Melon, of 
Paris, general secretary of the ‘Committee of patronage of foreign 
students,” sets forth in detail the existing requirements: 
Explanation of terms used in this paper for which there is no exact English equivalent, or 
whose equivalent in English is misleading. 
1. Faculties. Equivalent to universities of other countries. 
2. Cours. The instruction or lectures of the professors. 
3. Dispense. An official certificate entitling the holder to exemption from certain examinations in 
consideration of other and equivalent proofs of capacity, and upon condition of paying the accumu- 
lated fees for the examinations from which he is exempted. Because of the latter condition the ~ 
‘dispense ” is said to give tho right to the candidacy for the higher degree by ‘‘titre onéreux” (literally, burdensome title). 
4. Inscription. The act of registering on the roll of a faculty; for this formality, which must be 
renewed every three months, a fee is charged. Only those who have taken the required number 
of inscriptions can be admitted to examination. 
5. Stage oficinal. Period of practical work in “compounding medicines required of students in 
pharmacy. 
6, Travaux pratiques. Practical works which differ in the different faculties. In the faculty of medi- 
cine, they comprise anatomical dissections, hospital practice, ete.; in the faculty of sciences, 
experiments, and, in general, laboratory work. 
Higher education in France is given in the faculties and the special schools. The 
faculties form groups which, while a part of the State system (that is, dependent 
upon the State), preserve a certain autonomy. The courses are absolutely free.! 
There are four faculties, that of letters, of sciences, of medicine, and of law. They 
are as freely open to foreigners as to the natives, either being admitted to take their 
degree, Both foreigners and natives are required to furnish proof of certain prelim- 
inary study. For foreigners this proof consists in the production of a certificate of 
secondary study. This is then referred to the judgment of the minister, who decides 
whether the scientific value of the certificate produced is sufficient to admit of the 
course being followed with profit. This is called a “‘ dispense” (i. e., exemption or 
authorization). This authorization, however, does not carry the right to enter the 
desired course excepting by “titre onérenx,” that is to say, that the candidate pays 
the accumulated fees for the terms of study or the examinations from which he is 
exempted by the “dispense.” 
This ‘‘dispense” is never granted for the degrees of licentiate or doctor; but a 
waste of the time for studying may be obviated by the cumulative concessions of a 
certain number of “inscriptions” (terms), granted on the condition that the student 
shall submit to a probationary examination. The foreign doctor of medicine who 
wishes to take the title of doctor in French medicine may perhaps be authorized to 
take an aggregate of sixteen inscriptions simultancously,* but he must undergo an 
examination and submit a theme, The foreign pharmacist may obtain a “dispense” 
or exemption from the stage of practical work (stage officinal) and the concession 
of twelve terms, but he must submit to three definitive examinations. When a

tions, diplomas, etc., but the regular courses under the professors are free.

foreign student who has graduated from a foreign university wishes to take the course 
in a French university he is required to send to the minister of public instruction a 
request for a “dispense,” accompanied by the diplomas obtained in his native country 
after they havo been translated and legalized; also a certificate of birth (original 
and translation). When the certificate produced by the grantee shows obscurities 
or gap, the foreigner is subjected to a trial examination by a commission of the 
faculty in which he wishes to enter. This examination is based on the matter which 
was not clearly indicated by the certificate which had been shown. The comple- 
mentary Latin examination consists in a theme and translation written at sight. 
This applies only to the students who aspire to the degrees conferred by the fac- 
ulty; but those who wish simply to profit by the instruction have the greatest liberty 
allowed them in following the course. 
The foreigner who has furnished proof of the necessary preliminary instruction is 
admitted to the greater number of our special schools, either as pupil or as free 
auditor, and especially is this the case with the Superior Maritime School, the School 
of St. Cyr, the School of Forestry at Nancy, the School of Manufactures, the Superioy 
School of Mines, the School of Bridges and Roads, the School of Telegraphy, the 
School of Agriculture (Institut National Agronomique), the Schools of Decorative 
Arts and of Fine Arts, the ‘“‘Ecéle Centrale,” the “ Eeéle Pratique des Hautes 
Etudes,” the Conservatory of Music, ete. 
In order to obtain the degrees in higher education it is necessary to pay the fees 
for inscription for the library, for practical work, examinations, and diploma. 
The fee for inscription (which carries the privileges of the course for one term) is 
30 franes ($6) for three months, that of the library 10 francs ($2) per annum, that of 
the diploma varies from 40 to 100 franes ($8 to $20). z 
The diploma fees shown in detail are: 
Theology: Baccalaureate in theology, 155 francs ($31); licentiate in theology, 155 
francs ($31); doctorate in theology, 190 franes ($38). 
Law: Certificate of capacity in law, 255 frances ($51); baccalaureate, 700 franes 
($140); licentiate, 430 francs ($86): doctorate, 570 franes ($114). 
Medicine: Doctorate, 1,305 francs ($261); diploma of surgeon dentist, 960 francs 
($192). 
Science: Certificate of study (in chemistry and natural science), 300 francs ($60) ; 
baccalaureate, 120 franes ($24); licentiate, 230 franes (#46); doctorate, 140 franes 
($28). 
Letters: Baccalaureate, 120 franes ($24); licentiate, 230 francs ($46); doctorate, 
140 francs ($28). 
Pharmacy: Diploma of pharmacy, first class, 144 frances ($28.80); diploma of phar- 
macy (higher), 400 franes ($80). 
The degree conferred by the faculties in France are those of bachelor, of licentiate, 
and of doctor. 
No student can bo registered for the course in which he presents himself for 
examination unless he is a bachelor of letters, excepting for the faculty of science, 
in which a diploma of bachelor is sufficient.1 
To be admitted to take the examination of bachelor in theology it is necessary to 
follow a course of three years in one of the faculties of the French Republic, com- 
mencing with the first year of preparatory study, terminated by an examination” 
called the ascension in theology. Students provided with the licentiate of letters 
are exempted from the preparatory year. Every six months the student must pre- 
sent himself for examination (examen de passage). For the baccalaureate one must 
undergo a written and oral examination and submit in public a printed thesis. 
For the licentiate in theology it is necessary to show proof of four terms taken 
  1'Pho official decree of August 8, 1290, instituting a single bachelor’s degree for the three formerly 
recognized was waived for candidates for the degree of bachelor of science until November, 1894. 
Hence many candidates for higher degrees have only the science baccalaureate.
-P-A-G-E-708
632 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
since the oaccalaureate, and one only receives the degree of licentiate after under- 
going a written and oral examination and submitting two theses, one of which is 
in Latin. 
In order to be received as doctor in theology one must submit a general theme after 
having proved four inscriptions taken since the licentiate. 
Examination for law.—In order to obtain a certificate of capacity in law a diploma of 
bachelor is not necessary. It is necessary to take four inscriptions, to follow during 
one year the course of civil law for the first and second years, and also the course of 
criminal and civil procedure, and to pass an examination on matters connected with 
each of these courses. 
The course for the baccalaureate is one of two years. For the licentiate there is a 
supplementary year. At the end of the scholastic year each student must pass an 
examination on all the subjects taught during the year. The second examination 
confers the degree of bachelor of law; the third, that of licentiate in law. 
The last is divided into two parts. The written examination consists in two com- 
positions, one on a question of civil law, the other on a question of commercial law. 
“The candidate may make use of the Code. 
Only candidates (those who have taken the necessary inscriptions) are admissible 
to the examinations. ‘There are two ordinary sessions, one in July and the other in 
November. Unless for some very serious reason the student must piesent himself in 
July. 
In order to obtain a diploma of doctorate in law the candidate must first be a 
licentiate in law, pursue a four-years course of study, pass two examinations, and 
sustain a public act (disputation in which the candidate maintains a certain 
proposition). 
The diploma of doctor of law must make mention of one of the following subjects: 
Science of jurisprudence, political and economic science, 
The candidate recognized as prepared for a degree in one of the above-named 
subjects may obtain the other by passing the examination and composing and sus- 
taining a second theme. 
Doctorate in medicine.—The aspirants for a doctorate in medicine, in order to take 
the first inscription, must produce the bachelor’s diploma of classical studies (lettres- 
philosophie) and the special certificate of studies (pnysics, chemistry, and natural 
sciences).! They must pass five examinations and sustain a thesis. The subject of 
the thesis is chosen by the candidate. 
The first examination takes place between the sixth and eighth terms; the second 
between the eighth and tenth; the third between the thirteenth and sixteenth; the 
fourth and fifth after the sixteenth. The fourth and fifth and the theme must be 
submitted to the same faculty. 
Examination in the faculty of letters.—The candidate for the examination of licen- 
tiate must possess the title of bachelor of letters and take four terms in the course 
of the faculty. There are four classes of the licentiate of letters—literary, philo- 
sophical, historical, and living languages. 
There are two sessions (of the examining board) per annum, one in July and the 
other in November. At Paris there is an extraordinary session in April. 
Pharmacy.—Inferior diploma. After the twelfth term the students who have ful- 
filled the required term of study are admitted to the three examinations at the 
end of the course. The candidate who presents a thesis showing original research 
1 Certificate of studies, physics, chemistry, and natural sciences. ‘To be admitted to the course for 
this special certificate, which is given in the faculty of sciences, candidates must be provided with the 
diploma of bachelor or the teacher's diploma (brevet supérieur) or the certificate of studies of the 
superior primary schools. In order to be admitted to the examinations the student must have finished 
four terms and must have taken part in practical work. The examination comprises four interroga- 
tories and four proofs of practical study in the following subjects: Geology, chemistry, zoology, and 
botany.

may, with the consent of the school,! be exempted from the second part of the third 
examination. 
The superior diploma is obtained after four years of study, made valid by an exam- 
ination and the submission of an original theme approved by the school. 
The diploma of higher instruction is equivalent to the doctorate of physics and 
natural sciences. 
Besides these there are, in certain faculties of letters, of science, and of law, certifi- 
cates of higher studies and of legal study. The conditions for obtaining this cer- 
tificate are left to the faculties, who have the greatest liberty in regard to the same. 
This certificate, as its name indicates, simply bears witness to the kind of study 
pursued by the recipient and does not allow him any of the rights conferred by the 
diploma, 
In the same manner there is given in the faculty of letters a diploma of higher 
study in history and geography. This diploma serves as the evidence of a scientific 
apprenticeship on the »art of the student. This diploma is delivered after the fol- 
lowing proofs: 
(a) Examination and discussion of a topic in history or geography, which is chosen 
by the candidate and approved by the professors or masters or lecturers in history 
and geography of the faculty of letters or of the superior normal school. 
(b) Discussion of a question in history and of a question in geography indicated 
to the candidate three months in advance. . 
(c) The critical explanation of a historical or geographical text chosen by a can- 
didate. 
(d) Examination upon a subject drawn by let, at the choice of the candidate, 
either from the sciences auxiliary to history (archeology, ethnography. paleography, 
diplomacy, bibliography) or from general geography. 
The faculties of science deliver a certificate of higher study corresponding to the 
subjects taught by them. The diploma of licentiate in science is conferred on the 
student who produces three certificates of study. 
The student is allowed to choose between the different subjects which are taught 
in the faculties, and, if he presents the certificates of higher studies, he may obtain 
the degree of licentiate. 
Higher instruction is also given in a great number of schools or scientific estab- 
lishments which have an independent life. These establishments do not grant 
degrees as do the faculties, but they confer certain diplomas having an exclusively 
scientific character. For example, the Ecole pratique des hautes études (Practical 
School of Higher Studies), the School of Charts, the School of Oriental and Living 
Languages, schools or establishments such as the ‘‘Collége de France,” the Museum 
of Natural History, the “‘Eeole du Louvre” (School of the Louvre), all of which are 
veritable scientific laboratories in which one may pursue the investigation of truth. 
The courses in these establishments are open to foreigners as freely as to the natives. 
As to the special schools of application, such as maritime schools, the school of 
forestry, the schools of agriculture, the school of mines, etc., foreigners are admit- 
ted as free auditors or as pupils, if they prefer, provided that they have had sufficient 
scientific instruction and are recommended by the minister of their own country 
residing in France. 
In order to facilitate the sojourn of foreigners in the universities and in the schools, 
committees, called committees of patronage for foreign students, have been formed 
at Paris and in the most important educational centers of the provinces. These 
committees not only endeavor to do for the students everything possible as regards 
educational advantages and moral support, but also everything that is necessary 
from the point of view of material life. By means of their intervention between 
the student and the municipal authorities the sojourn in France is rendered as profit- 
able and agreeable as possible. Many of these are organized to give foreigners every

opportunity to acquire the Frenchlanguage. Installation in one of these is sufficient 
to procure hospitality of the broadest and most comfortable sort. These committees 
are found at Aix, Bordeaux, Montpellier, Nancy, Paris, and Toulon. 
The following statement relative to recent otticial regulations respect- 
ing the status of foreign students of medicine in France was drawn up 
by Mr. Henry Vignaud, chargé d’affaires of the United States at Paris. 
The paper was transmitted from the State Department to the Depart- 
ment of the Interior and referred by the Secretary of the Interior to 
this office for the purpose of bringing its contents to the attention of 
those specially interested in the information: 
EmBassy OF THE UNITED StaTEs, 
Paris, July 24, 1896. 
Sir: American medical students who come to Paris with the view of graduating 
in one of the medical schools of France were heretofore allowed certain facilities to 
enter these schools. “When they were graduates of our well-known colleges, or held 
a diploma of doctor of medicine issued by a reputable foreign scientific institution, 
they were permitted, upon application being made through this embassy, to follow 
the regular courses of the French medical schools exactly like French students who 
had graduated from the French faculties, and at the end of the course, in the fall, 
if successful in the final examination, were awarded the same diploma as those to 
Frenchmen—diploma which carried with it the privilege of practicing in France. 
The number of foreign students in France haying by degrees considerably increased, 
and the proportion of those who, for a certain time at least, remain here to practice 
their profession having also become much larger, the French Government has adopted 
a stricter rule for the admission of foreigners to the French medical schools. 
In the future, foreigners desirous of obtaining the same diploma of doctor of med- 
icine as that awarded to Frenchmen will have to submit to the same conditions 
imposed upon French students; that is to say, that the diploma they may have 
obtained abroad or in any private institution will not be at all considered, and that 
before being allowed to register at any of the French medical schools, they will 
have to produce, like French students, a French State diploma of ‘‘Bachelier de 
VEnseignement classique,” and the “‘Certificat de Sciences physiques, chimiques et 
naturelles.” 
To the foreign students who do not propose to practice medicine in France the 
facilities usually extended to them will be continued and even enlarged, but they 
will only be entitled to a special diploma solely intended for foreigners of that class 
and granting no rights to practice in France. 
These regulations were issued on the 21st instant. They are not applicable to 
foreign students already registered. 
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
HENRY ViIGNAUD.

Seerctary of State.

APPENDIX. 
EDUCATION IN FRANCE.! 
By Dr. Atckr Fortier. 
Panis, July 31, 1895. 
Since my arrival in Paris nothing has interested me more than the general compe- 
tition of the lycées and colleges at the Sorbonne.. I was fortunate in obtaining an 
admission card, and I had an excellent seat, where I heard perfectly the addresses of 
the orator of the day and of the minister of publicinstruction. The following extract 
from the Temps of July 31 gives a good idea of what took place: 
“At noon the minister arrived, escorted by a platoon of policemen on horseback. 
A double line of policemen pushed back the idlers on the sidewalk of boulevard St. 
Michel and of rue des Ecoles. 
“M., Gréard, vice-rector, received, on the steps of the Sorbonne, M. Poincaré, who 
was accompanied by M. Liard, director of superior education; M. Rabier, director of 
secondary education; M. Xavier Charmes, director of the secrétariat; M. Bernard, 
chief of the cabinet, and M. Grant, private secretary. 
“The minister entered by the middle door and went to the reception hall, the 
drums beat, and the foot guard were ranged in a row in the grand vestibule. 
“The cortége went by the gallery of the faculty of letters toward the grand amphi- 
theater. The mace bearers of the faculties walked ahead, then came the members 
of the academic council, of the general council, of the faculties of the superior coun- 
cil of public instruction, of the institute, of the diplomatic corps, ete. All these 
high dignitaries took their seats on the platform around the minister. 
“The hall was entirely filled. In the hemicyele were seated M. Gréard, the pro- 
viseurs (presidents) of the lycées, and the faculty professors, behind them the stu- 
dents, In the tribunes and the galleries were the relations of the students and 
the persons holding cards. The music of the republican guard played a selection. 
Then M. Poincaré called on M. Bergson, pppleescr of philosophy at the Lycée Henry 
IV, for the oration of the day.” 
M. Bergson chose for his subject, “Good Sense and the Classical Studies,” and 
spoke with great elegance. 
The address of M. Paincaré was really very fine. Here are some passages which 
impressed me: 
“Our education is made, in part, from what we receive from others, and, in part, 
from the free working of our will. The lessons of the school and of the college com- 
plete one another, in the course of our lives, by the teaching of things and by the 
example of men; they are sharpened by the secret action of conscience. Our youth 
is passed in continuing the education of our childhood; our mature age, in perfect- 
ing that of our youth; our old age, in regretting our not having had the time to 
terminate that of our mature age. But we leave after us a little of that education 
always incomplete, and that little enters, for the benefit of future generations, the 
common fund of humanity. 
“Tn that continuous evolution which constitutes education the school and the 
college will never give to the mind of the student but a first orientation, but what 
is indispensable is to make exactly that direction in the path of right and truth. 
“ We do for you, my friends, what we can. We do not answer for remote devia- 
tions and unforeseen accidents. We set the needle as best we can. Let each one of 
you then regulate his march, survey his route, and maintain the initial velocity. 
“But if Irepeat thus, writing them purposely, these two fraternal expressions of 
school and college, it is because education has not, according to the degree of instrue- 
tion, distinct aims and contrary paths; because the impetus, weaker here and stronger 
1 Translated by the author from his ‘‘ Voyage in Europe in 1895.""
-P-A-G-E-712
  636 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
there, must be everywhere in accord; because everywhere the clear and just percep- 
tion of life must be awakened, and because in the college as well as in the school, 
the work of the state, unless it be inert and useless, is the initiation, prudent and 
resolute, of childhood to contemporary reality.” 
These are very liberal ideas, this is what modern education should be; it must not 
be always directed toward the past, it must attend to the present and look the future 
boldly in the face in order to be able to surmount all the difficulties which might 
present themselves. 
The list of premiums was ready, and the students came to receive their prizes, 
which consisted in books, and in a crown which the minister or one of the high dig- 
nitaries on the platform placed on the heads of the students. When the grandson of 
M. Gréard was called the latter rose from his seat and kissed the boy on both cheeks. 
That caress of a grandfather was truly French and was loudly applauded. There 
were a first premium, a second premium, and eight accessits (second bests). Among 
that large number of pupils representing all the lycées of Paris I was astonished to 
hear only two historical names called, d’Argenson and de Maurepas. This fact shows 
the changes in society made by the French Revolution. 
The distribution of prizes in Paris does not resemble at all the commencement exer- 
cises of our colleges; besides, the French lycées are entirely different from the 
American colleges. M. Foucin, general secretary of the Alliance Frangaise, was kind 
enough to procure for me the following authorization, which I reproduce here to show 
what are the formalities requisite to visit the schools and lycées in Paris.    
“ACADEMY OF Panis, UNIVERSITY OF FRANCE, 
“ Paris, July 13, 1895. 
“M. Alcée Fortier, professor in New Orleans, member of the Alliance Frangaise, is 
authorized to attend a few classes in the following establishments: 
“Lycée Janson de Sailly, rue de la Pompe. 
“College Chaptal, boulevard des Batignolles. 
“Feole Turgot, rue de Turbigo. 
“Ecole normale (institutions de la Seine et école primaire annexe, 10 rue Molitor. 
“The proviseur and directors will please give all facilities to M. Fortier. 
“THE VICE-RECTOR, GREARD.” 
With this authorization I presented myself at about 8.30 a.m. at the Lycée Janson 
de Sailly, situated at Passy, between Paris and the Bois de Boulogne. It is a mag- 
nificent establishment, which comprises, according to the prospectus, “four colleges 
really distinct,” where the students, according to their age, form four separate 
divisions, which do not communicate with one another. They each have their 
court for recess, their study halls, their classes, their refectories, and dormitories. The 
first two colleges form the ‘grand lycée,” directed by the proviseur; the last two 
colleges constitute the ‘petit lycée.” 
Children are admitted at the lycée at the age of 6, and they remain there until 
they have obtained the bachelor’s degree, between 164 and 17 years. We see that 
young men in France leave the lycées at about the age when, in the United States, 
they enter college; that is to say, if classes were named, as with us, freshman, sopho- 
more, junior, and senior, the bachelors in France would be of the age of the freshman 
class, or rather of the sophomore. It is true that in leaving the lycée the young man 
may go to one of the great schools of the Government—Superior Normal School, 
Polytechnic School, Central School, St. Cyr, Agronomic Institute, School for High 
Studies, ete. 
At the Lycée Janson de Sailly ‘religious instruction is given to the boarding 
students for whom a special dispensation has not been asked by the parents. Con- 
ferences are given in each division, and give rise to periodical compositions and 
annual premiums, as in the other branches. Two chaplains of the Catholic religion, 
a pastor, and a rabbi are attached to the house. On the demand of families, the day 
scholars are admitted gratuitously to the religious conference.”

Yregret that I was able to visit only one class at Janson de Sailly. On arriving 
at the lycée I asked for the proviseur, and his secretary told me that he had just left 
his office with the inspector. I was requested to wait in an antechamber, where 
through the windows I saw the boys playing in the yard. I did not, lack time to 
study the games of the students, for the proviseur did not return. After having 
waited for an hour, I asked the secretary whether I could not visit the lyeée with 
some other person than the proviseur. The secretary seemed to be terrified, and 
exclaimed: ‘‘Oh, sir! Visit the lycée in the absence of Monsieur le Proviseur!” I 
waited half an hour longer; then I left. I came back in the afternoon, at2o’clock, and 
had the good fortune to meet the proviseur. That gentleman received mo per- 
fectly, and replied with great politeness to the numerous questions which I asked 
him about education in France. I could not help expressing my astonishment that 
they should have made me wait for an hour and a half in an antechamber without 
allowing me to visit the establishment in his absence. I told him that in my country 
if a professor in a French lycée were to visit one of our colleges he would not wait 
five minutes; in the absence of the president any one of the professors would will- 
ingly take him all over the college. The proviseur told me that what had happened 
to me was the result of the inordinate centralization in France. He introduced me 
then to the censor, who took me to a Latin class—the third class, I believe. The class 
was reading an extract from Seneca, but the professor told me that the author read 
by the class was Livy, which appeared to me an advanced grade for boys of 13 or 14. 
The pronunciation of Latin is entirely French, and differs completely from that of 
the American colleges. The students begin Latin and Greek one year earlier than 
with us, and I believe that they are right in France. The professor’s seat is ona 
platform and the students’ benches are in rows raised one above the other. I was 
well pleased with the method of teaching, although it seemed to me that the pro- 
fessor spoke a little too much about Seneca and did not question the students 
sufficiently. In a class of young pupils it is better that they should translate the 
Latin and explain the grammatical construction than to hear the professor give a 
kind of lecture on the author whose work is being read. 
On leaving the Latin class I was invited by the censor to return the next morning 
to the lycée. LI arrived at the appointed time, but to my great surprise the censor 
told me that the students were standing their examinations and that the presence of 
astranger might embarrass them. I was astonished at this reasoning, for according 
to M. Gréard’s letter all facilities were to be given me to study the system of educa- 
tion in France, and there is no better way to understand what a class is doing than 
to attend the examinations of that class. I said to myself that either the Lycée Janson 
de Sailly was not a very hospitable place or at that school there was exaggerated 
red tape. 
I went immediately to the normal school for teachers of the Seine, and there I was 
most cordially received. I did not wait a minute, and I attended the examinations 
of several classes—French grammar, mathematics, English, and explanation of 
French texts. The examination in grammar was not brilliant, and I saw that pupils 
in France do not distinguish themselves in that branch any more than in America. 
The explanation of texts was very good, and the examination in English very inter- 
esting. The examination inmathematics was satisfactory. The pupils present them- 
selves four or five at a time before two teachers and are examined orally. 
I was anxious to see Chaptal College, of which my friend Dr. Devron, a former 
pupil of that institution, had often spoken tome. I was admitted immediately, and I 
attended M. Hinzelin’s class in literature. At Chaptal College there are two classes 
of professors—the general professors and the special professors. The former are 
charged ‘“‘first, to be present at the courses of the special professors of a division; 
second, to classify weekly the pupils of that division.” 
M. Hinzelin is a special professor and a poet of talent. I listened with great inter- 
est to a lecture which he gave on Alfred de Musset. He made a critical analysis of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-714
  -638 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
principal works of the poet and recited hundreds of lines. 1 was impressed by some 
of his remarks. He said that the Andromaque of Racine was parodied by Musset in 
his Marrons du Feu, and made an interesting comparison between the two works. He 
said also that Musset resembles La Fontaine; that he affects laziness like the great 
fabulist; that he unrhymed his verses purposely. M. Hinzelin’s réle is limited to 
giving lectures to the pupils; the latter take notes and are examined on these notes 
by another professor. It does not seem to me that this system is good. Inthat way 
the professor does not exert a sufficient influence on his pupils. 
I took aspecial interest in M. Gricourt’s English class. This professor, whom Iliad 
already met at the normal school for teachers of the Seine, pleased me very much, I 
have never met a more charming man. He speaks English very well, without any 
trace of French accent. His class was reading David Copperfield and translated 
very creditably that novel difficult to translate. M. Gricourt does not believe in the 
natural method, and uses in the beginning of his course an English grammar written 
in French. He trics, however, as much as possible to speak English to his pupils. 
He requested me to speak to them in English, and I questioned them on what I had 
told them. They answered very well. 
Chaptal College belongs to the city of Paris and was founded by Prosper Goubaux 
in 1844, It corresponds, to a certain extent, with the German Realschule; that is to 
say, Latin and Greek are taught, and much attention is given to the physical and 
natural sciences, tothe modern languages, and to the French language and literature. 
The following extract from the prospectus explains the aim of the founder: 
“Tn organizing, in 1844, Chaptal College, the city of Paris had for its aim to creato 
an establishment where the young might find, at the same time as the principles and 
the general instruction which are the basis of any good education, an instruction 
which should prepare them for examinations requiring a niore special study of the 
sciences, for the different occupations of banking, of finance, and of the administra- 
tion, as well as for the professions specially devoted to industry. commerce and 
agriculture,” 
Chaptal College, as well as the lycées, receives boarders, half-bearders, and day 
scholars, and the instruction is not free. The building is immense and very hand- 
some. A. Dumas fils and Claretie are former pupils of Chaptal. I had the pleasure 
of receiving a visit from M. Hédoux, secretary of the friendly association of the 
alumni of Chaptal College, to whom Dr. Devron had kindly introduced me. 
Secondary education is given in the lycées and colleges, and is not free. It is even 
costly, but the Government grants a certain number of scholarships in each lycée or 
college. Let me oxplain here that by ‘University of France” is meant the whole sys- 
tem of education directed by the Government, and by “academy” the institutions co: 
prised in a certain locality. Thus, the Academy of Paris forms part of the University 
of France, and signifies the institution of the Government situated in Paris. 
Besides the lycées and the colleges and the schools of the Government, there are 
everywhere in France private schools and schools directed by the religious orders. 
Secondary education is divided into two parts, classical secondary and modern 
secondary. The elementary division comprises the preparatory class and the classes 
of the cighth and seventh grades; the division of grammar comprises the classes of the 
sixth, fifth, and fourth grades; the superior division comprises the classes of the third 
and second grades, of rhetoric, and of philosophy. The programmes of tho modern 
secondary are about like those of Chaptal College, and do not differ much from those 
of the German Realschule. In the latter, however, Latin is taught, but not Greek, 
which is replaced by a more completo study of mathematics, of modern languages, 
and of the physical and natural sciences. In the French modern secondary, Latin 
and Greek aro not taught. The classes of rhetoric and of philosophy of the clas- 
sical instruction are replaced in the modern by the first class (letters) and the first 
class (sciences). The bachelor’s degree of the modern secondary course gives access 
to almost all professions. There are also in the lycées special classes of mathematics,    
      
-P-A-G-E-715
    EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 639 
where one studies arithmetic, algebra, geometry, descriptive geometry, and analyt- 
ical geometry. In the regular course of mathematics descriptive geometry and 
analytical geometry are not taught. 
The student who has received his bachelor’s degree may prepare himself for the 
excellent institutions for superior instruction in Paris, but it seems to me that it 
would be better if the studies of the lycées were continued two or three years longer, 
and if there were universities in the principal cities of France, as before the revo- 
lution, and asin America and in Germany to-day. The system of instruction in the 
lycées appears to me very judicious, but I fear that there is overwork in the study of 
Greek and of Latin. I like very much the study of the modern languages, German 
and English, begun in the preparatory class and continued to the end of the course, 
in the class of philosophy and in the first grade classes. There are also optional 
classes in Italian, Spanish, and Russian. 
As far as Ican judge the system of education in Paris and, consequently, in France, 
is excellent. The Government, howeyer, does not offer as many facilities for supe- 
rior instruction as in the United States. With us, in almost every State, there isa 
State university where tuitionis free. In France all the great schools for superior edu- 
cation are in Paris, and that must prevent a number of young men from rising higher 
than the bachelor’s degree. The great advantage of France over the United States 
is that primary clementary education iscompulsory. By thatsystem, in a few years, 
all Frenchmen will know how to read and write, and France need no longer fear, as 
was said in 1870, to be vanquished by the German schoolmaster.

    CHAPTER XII. 
EDUCATION IN MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA. 
By F. F. HinpEer. 
Mexico and the Republics of Central America have a history which is exceedingly 
interesting to every thoughtful and unprejudiced student of human life and progress 
on this continent. ; 
To the people of this country Mexico has a peculiar interest, not only from her 
being our nearest southern neighbor, separated from us by a merely imaginary boun- 
dary line 1,250 miles in extent, but from the fact that in her long struggle for liberty 
she has always looked up to the United States as her model, and has proved her 
confidence in our institutions by adopting them as a basis for herown. In her efforts 
to establish a republican form of government Mexico has labored under tremendous 
disadvantages as compared with our own battle for independence. 
English rule in this country was based on the spirit of liberty, and however far the 
Government may have departed from that spirit, the people of the colonies were 
enlightened and in every way prepared by nature and training for self-government. 
In Mexico and Central America the material for citizenship was very different. Dur- 
ing the years of Spanish dominion the ruling class was Spanish or of Spanish blood. 
The Spanish-American or mixed race then had little influence, and a middle class 
hardly existed. There was only a ruling class, rendered autocratic and tyrannical 
by centuries of domination over a downtrodden and enslaved people, and the great 
toiling masses who lived the life of the serfs of feudal times, so ignorant that they 
did not know enough to be unhappy in their lot, nor to form plans to improve it. 
The chaotic past has been very dark, and to the superficial observer it may have 
often appeared almost hopeless to expect that a free and progressive republic could 
arise from the discordant elements, but each upheaval has left the country a little in 
advance, and the outlook for the past few years has been brighter than ever before. 
In the construction of their constitutions the United States and Mexico made 
grievous errors, which in both instances came near destroying the Governments. 
The United States guaranteed slavery and made religion free. Mexico abolished 
slavery but restricted the right of worship to a single sect. Both of these errors 
have been rectified, but by a fearful expenditure of blood and treasure, and in the 
case of Mexico by the prolongation of her exhausting struggle for freedom. 
The enlightened and sagacious statesmen of Mexico can look backward with pride 
on a history teeming with the details of a heroic struggle for liberty, and to the 
future as offering a brilliant prospect for the enjoyment of the benefits and blessings 
of republican institutions. 
For the full fruition of their hopes and aspirations the great necessity is that the 
people, by the diffusion of knowledge and the spread of education, may become 
worthy citizens and judicious conservators of the liberty that has been won for them. 
Popular education must now do for Mexico what no other agency can accomplish 
toward building up a government “of the people, for thé people, and by the people,” 
whose foundations must be laid in an intelligent and self-respecting citizenship.

  642 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The population of the Republic of Mexico in 1893 was 12,056,046. The predomi- 
nating race, in numbers, of the present day is not the Indian, asin former times. An 
official authority classes the present population as consisting of 19 per cent European 
and Spanish-American, 38 per cent Indian, and 43 per cent of mixed blood. 
There is now a very large and influential middle class, composed of both Indian 
and mixed races, which is every year, by the spread of education, gaining large 
accessions from the humbler class, who are making wonderful progress by aid of the 
fine educational advantages now offered them. It is from this class that are spring- 
ing from year to year men of genius and talent, who by toil and study are taking 
their position in the frontrank of the army of progress, in commerce, literature, art, 
and science, which is the reward of labor, fidelity, and patience. 
It is to the credit of the statesmen who have directed the career of the country in 
its heroic struggle for liberty that they have always recognized the fact that popular 
education is one of the primary functions in the life of the State; that no republican 
form of government can exist without it, and that the question of the education of 
its citizens is one which concerns the life and permanence of the State. They saw 
clearly that it was a question for the State, and one that could not be left to a 
church or a parent to decide; that the Republic must claim the right to educate its 
citizens, not only from a humanitarian point of view, but to preserve its integrity 
and existence. é 
In spite of all the unrest and turmoil of the years which followed the downfall of 
the Spanish power in Mexico, the attention of the Government directed toward 
the question of education. The first law on the subject, which was compiled by Don 
Jose Louis Mora, during the presidency of Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa-Anna, was 
promulgated in October, 1833. It was based upon advanced and liberal principles, 
and contained an excellent plan of study for use in the public schools. It, however, 
contained also a provision authorizing the appropriation of some real estate belong- 
ing to the church to provide the necessary funds. The clergy were excluded from 
taking any part in public education maintained at the expense of the Government, 
and the ancient Clerical University was suppressed. 
The reactionary and clerical party were strong enough to create arevolution, which 
resulted in the restoration to the church of the property which had been taken, and 
the reestablishment of the university under the direction of the clergy. 
For several years the country.was convulsed by war with France and civil war 
within its borders, but in spite of these troubles the cause of education was not lost 
sight of, and in August, 1843, the Government issued a decree for the purpose of 
establishing uniformity in methods of teaching and a graded system of classes in 
the schools. In November of the same year a decree was published centralizing in 
the City of Mexico the whole direction of the educational system of the country. 
This remained in force until October, 1846, when the centralization was abolished and 
the right returned to the states to control the educational systems within their own 
boundaries. 
The war with the United States for several years prevented any progress in national 
educational matters, and the revolution of 1852, which led to the establishment of 
the dictatorship of General Santa-Anna, again caused aretrograde movement toward 
the old antidemocratic system. In 1855 this insupportable tyranny was overthrown 
and a constitutional republic was established, one of the first acts of which was to 
restore the educational law of 1843. In April, 1861, when Don Ignacio Ramirez was 
minister of justice, he obtained the passage of another law on the subject, which was 
one of the most liberal that had been promulgated, and true to the spirit of the law 
of 1833. The disturbed condition of the country, the invasion by the French army, 
and the disastrous reign of Maximilian prevented a practical application of the law, 
and it was not until the establishment of a constitutional republic that the cause of 
education emerged from the deplorable condition into which it had fallen during the 
continuance of the struggle which had conyulsed the country. A law was passed in 
December, 1867, for reopening the establishments for secondary instruction, which 
       
-P-A-G-E-719
EDUCATION IN MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA. 643 
had been closed; for the improvement of the primary schools, and to eliminate from 
the methods of teaching such ideas as were not in harmony with republican prinei-- 
ples. This law was amended by another promulgated May 15, 1869, giving a still 
greater impetus to instruction, extending the privilege of education to all social 
classes, and making primary instruction obligatory in the federal district and terri- 
tories. At last, after fifty years of almost continuous wars and revolutions, tho_ 
party of liberal opinions had definitely triumphed. The results of this triumph have 
been the complete separation of church and state, universal religious toleration, a 
constitution based on the broadest republican principles, a free press, and free schools- 
As the ground swell which had been raised on the sea of Mexican life by the storms 
that had swept over it subsided and the ship of state floated in calmer waters, a 
tremendous task lay before the Government, nothing less than the education of mil- 
lions of poor and ignorant people in the knowledge to be obtained from books, in 
the habit of thinking, and in all the essentials of self-respecting citizenship. Under 
the most favorable circumstances considerable time must be required for such an 
undertaking. Nothing can hasten beyond a certain point the solution of the problem, 
and it is not surprising that great difficulties were encountered. 
In April, 1873, the Government formulated another plan for public instruction, but 
owing to unforeseen obstacles unable to put it in operation. In October, 1887, 
the committee on public instruction of the House of Deputies presented a bill to 
enforce compulsory education within the Federal District and Territories, which 
became a law in 1888. 
The principal provisions of this law were the making primary instruction obliga- 
tory and free for all children between the ages of 6 and 12 years, directing the 
establishment of a primary school for boys and another for girls for every. 4,000 
inhabitants, which proportion might be raised in the Territories sof Tepic and Lower 
California, the schools to be placed under control of the local authorities, who were 
to have control of the funds and appoint directors and teachers. 
For the support of the schools the law provided that subsidies should be made 
from time to time by the Federal Government, and appropriations by municipal cor- 
porations from taxes levied for the purpose, and from such fines as might be imposed 
by law and devoted to the schools. In order to carry out the principle of compul- 
sory education, all persons having charge or control of minors were required to prove 
that the children for whom they were responsible had received the necessary primary 
education. The penalty for violation or neglect of this order was fixed at from 10 
cents to $10, or from one to ten days’ imprisonment. 
The law required that this plan should be put in operation within one year, but as 
it was desired to extend its provisions to all the States of the Republic its organiza- 
tion was suspended until this object could be attained. 
Here was encountered the principal difficulty caused by a lack of uniformity. In 
all educational matters a condition of chaos existed, as every State had its own school 
legislation; hence there was no uniform system in the curricula of secondary schools 
and preparation of teachers, while in the primary schools matters were still more 
complicated by changes and modifications made by municipal authorities. Educa- 
tional theories were taken from foreign pedagogical works without being thoroughly 
understood, and new methods and ideas were blindly accepted or rejected. Even in 
the course of a single school year changes were made and courses lengthened or 
shortened, to the confusion and bewilderment of both students and teachers, 
With a view to overcoming these difficulties, and to establish a uniform system in 
the legislative and scholastic regulations throughout the Republic, and to secure 
more satisfactory results from the efforts and sacrifices made by the Government in 
the cause of education, Sefior Joaquin Baranda, minister of justice and education, 
one of the most enlightened and progressive of Mexican statesmen, issued a circular 
in June, 1889, for the purpose of organizing in the City of Mexico a congress to be 
composed of eminent educators and representatives from the different States, to 
be appointed by their respective governors. This was followed by another circular 
          
   
-P-A-G-E-720
  644 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
issued on October 5 of the same year, requesting the governors to furnish for the use 
and guidance of the convention statistics giving the number of pupils receiving 
instruction in the schools, number of schools, resources for their maintenance, and 
copies of all the laws, regulations, programmes, and rules for study in use in their 
respective States. 
The convention met on November 28 in the chamber of the House of Deputies in 
the City of Mexico, under the presidency of Sefior Baranda, and the formal sessions 
commenced on December 1. It remained in session until March 31, 1890. 
The points submitted for the deliberation of the convention are comprised in the 
following extract from the’circular issued by the minister: 
“First. Primary, laic secular instruction, compulsory and gratuitous, including 
the age at which children should be received, the classes to be taught, the progress- 
ive order of study, the number of years to complete the course, the means of 
enforcing compliance with the rules, the establishment in towns of small schools for 
children and adults, and of rural schools, with itinerant teachers. 
“Second. Preparatory instructicn, gratuitous and voluntary, including the studies 
necessary for a complete and vigorous course, such as preparation for professions, the 
scientific distribution and order in which they are to be taught, the programme, and 
number of years to complete the course. 
“Third. Professional instruction, voluntary and protected by the State, including 
the subjects to be comprised in each course, the order and method of teaching, 
number of years to complete the course, practical professional programmes, and 
rules for professional examinations.” 
The work of the congress on all these points was well done, and immense progress 
was made in the direction of insuring uniformity in methods of national education, 
but in spite of the admirable spirit and industry of the delegates many minor ques- 
tions were left unsettled at the conclusion of their labors. 
In order to continue and perfect the work the minister of justice addressed another 
circular to the governors of the States, dated June 19, 1890, requesting them to 
appoint delegates to a second educational convention to be opened on December 1 of 
the same year. This convention met at the appointed time and completed the work 
assigned to it, closing its sessions in March, 1891. 
The work of these pedagogic congresses was very effective in harmonizing and 
introducing uniformity of administration; in awakening and renewing public inter- 
est in the establishment of schools and the whole subject of public education, and 
have promoted the adopting of measures which are a happy combination of local inde- 
pendence, with a degree of centralization sufficient to insure greater economy of 
means and equality of conditions and methods of instruction. 
The result of the work done by these two conventions was embodied in a law pro- 
mulgated by the Executive of the Republic on March 21, 1891, to take effect January 
7, 1892. 
The principal provisions of this law may be stated as follows: 
Primary elementary instruction made obligatory for children of both sexes from 6 
to 12 years of age, and may be obtained in any public or private school, or from 
private tutors, instruction in the public schools to be laic (secular) and gratuitous. 
The course of obligatory primary instruction for boys, to be completed in four 
years, to comprise: 
Instruction in the practical and civic duties of life; the national language, includ- 
ing reading and writing; arithmetic; rudiments of physics and natural sciences; 
elements of geometry; rudiments of geography and national history; drawing and 
sketching of common and simple objects; singing; gymnastic and military exercises, 
A similar programme to be adopted for girls’ schools, with the necessary modifica- 
tions in gymnastic exercises, and manual instruction in the following branches to 
be added: 
First year: Embroidery; stitching; hemming; knitting with wool and thread with 
wooden needles.
-P-A-G-E-721
  EDUCATION IN MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA. 645 
Second year: Straight backstitching ; knitting of designs; forked and coarse stitch. 
ing; embroidery with colored threads; band stitching. 
Third year: Sewing; backstitching; double sewing; tucking; knitting with metal 
needles; embroidery on coarse materials. 
Fourth year: Marginal embroidery; simple fastenings; raveling out; practical and 
simple ideas for cutting and making the principal garments. 
In cases where il is impossible to comply with the above programme of compulsory 
education, a four years’ course to comprise the following items will be considered as 
a sufficient compliance with the law: 
Practical ideas of the duties of life; instruction in civics and history of the nation; 
the national language, comprising reading and writing; arithmetic; such general 
lessons as may be convenient; gymnastic exercises. 
For the primary schools the scholastic year to consist of ten months, to commence 
January 7 and ending November 2, when the classes shall be suspended to commence 
the examinations. The scholastic week to consist of five days, from Monday to 
Friday, inclusive. In the first year the daily work not to exceed four and a half 
hours, in the second year five hours, five and a half hours in the third, and six hours 
in the fourth year. In the first year the time occupied in any lesson not to exceed 
twenty minutes, in the second year. twenty-five minutes, thirty in the third, and 
forty in the fourth year. Half an hour for recreation to be included in the hours for 
daily work, 
No punishments to be administered that may degrade or injure the children. 
In the public elementary schools there shall be a director to have charge of not to 
exceed fifty pupils, an assistant to be appointed for every fifty in excess of this 
number. 
In the schools where not more than one teacher is employed the supplementary 
programme to be adopted instead of the full course. 
In places where from lack of funds it is not possible to establish two schools the 
same programme shall be used in mixed schools, the boys to attend in the morning 
and girls in the afternoon, or vice versa. 
In order to stimulate teachers prizes consisting of medals and premiums of money 
are offered rewards for meritorious and painstaking work, as indicated by sue- 
cessful examinations of their pupils. At the termination of ten years’ faithful serv- 
ice teachers are given a bronze medal, a silver one at the end of twenty years, and 
one of gold at the completion of thirty years’ service, when they are entitled to 
retirement on full pay, or to receive double pay if they choose to continue their 
work. 
In the month of June, 1891, a body called “the superior body of primary instruc- 
tion” was established, to which all matters relating to elementary education are 
intrusted. 
Committees have been formed in the municipalities of the Federal District and the 
Territories to see that the law is complied with in respect to compulsory education. 
In the States, and particularly the less populous ones, and where the Indians pre- 
dominate, compulsory attendance, although recognized by law, can not yet be 
enforced. The extension of education among the rural population and the more 
remote communities is a problem that only time can solve. 
The Indian population, although uneducated, have the imitative faculty largely 
developed, and they display marvelous ingenuity in the construction of an infinite 
variety of articles. They manipulate straw, wax, wood, marble, grass, and hair; 
their productions from these substances and in clay and glazed pottery are marvel- 
ous. Their feather work also is beautiful, delicate, and artistic. There are pro- 
found possibilities in this race; with the dissemination of education among them 
they will enter the field of industrial competition with an equipment whicb, com- 
bined with their frugality and habits of patient labor, will in time elevate them to 
a much higher social plane. 
There ave still in the mountains and remote parts of Mexico many Indians who 
   
-P-A-G-E-722

are yet uncivilized, for whom special schools have been established, in which the 
teachers are young Indians taken from the same tribe and trained in the Govern- 
ment institutions for teachers. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
The Government of Mexico, while making provision for the dissemination of ele- 
mentary instruction among the masses of the people, has not been unmindful of its 
duties in meeting the demand for higher education and scientific training. It has 
laid under contribution the most advanced scientific research and experiments, and 
has organized schools and colleges covering almost every branch of education in 
science and art. 
EERS AND MINING. 
  NATIONAL COLLEGE OF ENGIN 
One of the most famous of the older scientific schools of Mexico was founded by 
royal ordinance in May, 1783, which ordered the establishment of a seminary for the 
teaching of metallurgy and mining. The college was opened January 1, 1792. It 
was afterwards installed in the magnificent building which it still occupies. This 
fine structure, which was commenced in 1797 and finished in 1813, cost, including 
repairs which have since been made, $1,500,000. In December, 1867, the national 
school of engineers was established in the same building, and in November, 1881, 
together with the school of agriculture, it was taken from the jurisdiction of the 
secretary of justice and assigned to the secretary of colonization, industry, and com- 
merce. In May, 1883, however, both of these schools were again placed in charge of 
the secretary of justice and a decree published establishing new rules and regulations 
for their guidance. At the same time new classes were formed and the programmes 
promulgated determining the course of study for the different branches of the pro- 
fessions concerned. 
In order to be enrolled as a student the candidate must present a certificate from 
the national preparatory school showing that he has passed a successful examina- 
tion either at that or some other official school in the States covering the following 
subjects: Spanish grammar, Greek roots, French, English, elements of German, arith- 
metic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, mechanics, experimental physics, natural 
history, cosmegraphy, physical and political geography (especialiy that of Mexico), 
logic, and linear and landscape drawing. 
The curricula of professional studies as established by law are as follow: 
For assayer and metallurgist: Analytic chemistry and assaying of minerals, sort- 
ing and grading ores, coining and management of mints, and industrial chemistry, 
with practical work in all these branches. 
For topographic and hydrographic engineer: Higher algebra, analytic geometry 
and integral calculus, descriptive geometry, topography, hydrography, meteorology, 
topographical drawing, and practical work in these branches. 
For industrial engineer: Higher algebra, analytic geometry and integral calculus, 
descriptive geometry and hydrography, stereotomy, carpentry, analytic and applied 
mechanics, industrial mechanics, construction and installation of machinery, analytic 
and industrial chemistry, meteorology, study of building*materials, theory and prac- 
tice of building, topographical, mechanical, and architectural drawing, and practical 
work in all. 
For road, bridge, and canal engineer: Higher algebra, analytic geometry and 
integral calculus, descriptive geometry, topography and hydrography, stereotomy 
and carpentry, analytic and applied mechanics, meteorology, theory and practice of 
building, study of building materials, roads and railways, bridges, canals, harbor 
works, graphic statics, topographical, mechanical, and architectural drawing, and 
practical work, 
For mining engineer and metallurgist: Higher algebra, analytic geometry and 
integral calculus, descriptive geometry, topography and hydrography, analytic and 
applied mechanics, stereotomy and carpentry, study of building materials, theory

and practice of building, analytic chemistry and assaying, meteorology, mineralogy, 
paleontology, geology, mining work, artesian wells, mining legislation, metallurgy, 
graphic statics, topographical, mechanical, and architectural drawing, and practical 
work in branches named. 
For geographical engineer: Higher algebra, analytic geometry and integral cal- 
eulus, descriptive geometry, topography and hydrography, physies, meteorology, 
analytic mechanics, elements of cosmography, geodesy, physical and practical astron- 
omy, clements of geology, topographical and geographical drawing, and practical 
work in all. 
There are in connection also with this college schools in various places in the coun- 
try for the practical teaching of mining and metallurgy and the training of managers 
and overseers of mines and specialists in the various branches of mining industry. 
In these schools the prescribed course is: Elementary studies in arithmetic and 
algebra, geometry, trigonometry, physics, mechanics, chemistry, metallurgy and 
mining work, and accounts, and in practical application of all these clements to the 
management and economy of mines and reduction works; Spanish, and linear draw- 
ing. These studies, however, are subsidiary to the actual practice which forms the 
prominent feature in these schools. 
The college has a meteorological observatory and a well-assorted library of scien- 
tific books; also a museum of building niaterials, ores and minerals, fossils, and 
objects connected with geodesy, astronomy, and industrial mechanics. 
Two classes of pupils are admitted, viz, those who take the full course with the 
intention of adopting one of the professions taught in the college, and those who 
merely wish to attend one or two of the classes. AI] the classes are open to the 
public and any person may attend them. The instruction in the college and schools 
in connection with it is free, and no fee is required on entrance or at time of receiving 
a degree or diploma. é 
MEDICAL COLLEGE. 
The medical college was founded by royal. decree in 1768, and was established in 
the old convent at Belem. It afterwards occupied various other buildings until1853, 
when the Government purchased the structure formerly occupied by the Inquisition 
for the sum of $50,286 for the use of the college. Its classes were opened there in 
1854, and it still occupies the same premises. The cstablished courses are medicine, 
surgery, obstetrics, and pharmacy. Classes are established and lectures delivered 
on the following departments of medical science: Descriptive anatomy, pharmacy, 
physiology, histology, internal and external pathology, therapeutics, operative sur- 
gery, obstetries, hygiene, and meteorology, medical jurisprudence, and medical, 
surgical, and obstetrical clinics. 
For the profession of pharmacist the prescribed studies are: Theoretical and 
practical pharmacy, chemistry, and chemical analysis, history of drugs and materials 
used in medicine, and practical pharmaceutics. 
Female students are admitted to study for qualification as midwives in classes of 
theoretical obstetrics and the clinical lectures on that subject. 
There are also advanced and post-graduate classes in ophthalmology, gynecology, 
bacteriology, and pathological anatomy and histology. 
  NATIONAL MEDICAL INSTITUTE, 
This institution was established by the Government in 1888, and was formally 
opened in July, 1890, for the purpose of the study of the botany, fauna, climatology, 
and medical geography of the country and their practical application im the science 
and practice of medicine. It is controlled by the department of colonization and 
industry, and is governed by a faculty consisting of a director and prefect, subpre- 
fect, secretary, assistant secretary, and a treasurer appointed by the General Govern- 
ment. For carrying on its work the following departments have been established: 
First. Natural history, in charge of three professors, who must be doctors or phar-

macists, aided by an assistant professor, two draftsmen, « photographer, a collect- 
ing anatomist, and a clerk. Its objects are the collection of plants and animals, to 
classify and distribute them, and to study their history, properties, and character; 
to form herbariums and anatomical collections of animals, and to furnish the other 
institutions such specimens and data as they may require. 
Second. Analytic chemistry, in charge of three professors, who must be doctors or 
pharmacists, and five assistants. It is employed in analyzing and separating the 
elemental compounds of such products as may be sent to it by other departments, 
and when they are recent discoveries to make elementary analysis of them and 
arrange their formula; in making the requisite preparations for experimental use by 
the third department, and to furnish such data as may be required. 
Third. Experimental physiology, in charge of three professors, who must be doc- 
tors, and another who is a veterinary surgeon. Its work is to determine the dynamic- 
medical action of the elements and preparations under consideration by the second 
department, and to give the results of their studies to the governing board, advising 
when the same may be applied to therapeutics, or their opinions on the subject. 
Fourth. Clinical therapeutics, with two professors, one of whom is a physician, 
the other a surgeon, and six istant doctors, assisted by such military surgeons 
and physicians, attached to public hospitals and private medical institutions, as may 
wish to become attached as coworkers. The subject being the study of clinical appli- 
cation that can be made of the substances that have been considered by the first, 
second, and third departments. 
Fifth. Climatology and medical geography, with two medical professors, an assist- 
ant, and a clerk. Its objects are the study of the distribution of epidemic diseases 
inall parts of the Republic; the distribution and spread of epidemics; local etiolog- 
ical conditions in relation to the preceding subjects, and the nature of the diseases; 
climatic conditions and classificatign of the variations of the climate throughout 
the country for the purpose of forming a general climatological chart; distribution 
of water for the purpose of forming a hydrographical map, and the distribution of 
the races comprising the population and their classification. 
Gold and silver medals and diplomas are conferred on such professors as may lend 
efficient services, or who publish original works on subjects comprehended in the 
plan of the institution. 
The work done by the Mexican Medical College within the past few years is excel- 
lent, and it is now fairly entitled to be classed with the best institutions of this 
character in Europe and America. 
     
     
NATIONAL COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND VETERINARY SURGERY. 
An attempt to introduce the scientific teaching of agriculture in Mexico was made 
in 1850 by the establishment of professorships in the old college of San Gregorio. 
Classes were formed for theoretical teaching, and practical instruction was given on 
farms belonging to the college. In 1853 the Government founded an agricultural 
and veterinary school, which was established in February, 1854, in the building for- 
merly used as the convent of San Jacinto, which was purchased for that purpose. 
By a law passed in 1883 the whole subject of agricultural and veterinary instruc- 
tion received complete reorganization, and was placed under the supervision of the 
minister of public works. 
Pupils are now admitted at 12 years of age and upward, the only qualification for 
admission being a good primary education, and passing a successful examination. 
The full course of instruction occupies seven years, and is judiciously divided 
between literary and scientific subjects, theory and practice. For the latter a thor- 
oughly equipped experimental farm has been provided. ; 
The degrees granted by the college are agricultural engineer and veterinary sur- 
geon ; the courses of study are as follows: For agricultural engineer, arithmetic, 
algebra, trigonometry, analytic and descriptive geometry, integral calculus, analytic

and applied mechanics, topography and-hydrography, cosmography and geography, 
especially that of Mexico, physics, meteorology, agricultural chemistry and tech- 
nology, botany, zoology, geology, agronomy, hydrography, drainage and irrigation, 
farm buildings, zootomy, farm accounts, management and economy, agricultural 
legislation, Spanish language, Greek and Latin roots, French, English, and elements 
of German, landscape, topographical, mechanical, and architectural drawing, micro- 
biology, political economy and logic; also practical work on the farm. 
For veterinary surgeon, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, physics, meteorology, 
chemistry, botany, zoology, comparative and descriptive anatomy, study of domestic 
animals, farriery, veterinary physiology, surgery, obstetrics, hygiene, therapeutics, 
zootomy, medical jurisprudence and veterinary legislation, Spanish language, Greek 
and Latin roots, French, English, and elements of German, anatomical and landscape 
drawing, clinics, and practical work. 
For the veterinary school there is a large hospital with stables and cattle sheds, 
containing various types of domestic animals. There are also farriery shops and 
other adjuncts. 
At the termination of each college year scientific excursions are made to different 
parts of the country, giving the pupils the opportunity of studying the flora and 
fauna and the methods of cultivation appropriate to tropical, temperate, and cold 
climates, Mexico, in consequence of its peculiar topographical features, possessing 
all these variations of climate according to altitude. Industrial and agricultural 
establishments are also visited and inspected, so that at the end of the course the 
pupil is not only thoroughly equipped with professional knowledge, but he has 
acquired a practical knowledge of his native country and the various conditions he 
may have to encounter in his future professional career. 
There is also in connection with the college a completely equipped meteorological 
and astronomical observatory, the observations of which are transmitted every 
month to the National Observatory through the minister of public works. 
In addition to the appropriations for the support of the college the Government 
has established sixteen scholarships of $300 each for poor pupils, the retention of 
which, however, is subject to the condition of passing successful examinations. 
The college is at once aminstitution of higher instruction and a first-class secondary 
school. The Government has been prodigal of expense in its establishment and 
maintenance.    
COMMERCIAL COLLEGE. 
This institution was established in the year 1868 in compliance with the law of 
December, 1867, as a higher school of commerce and administration. It occupies a 
fine building, which was erected in 1756 by a religious corporation; having been con- 
fiscated in 1861, it was afterwards purchased from the holder by the Government for 
$75,000 and devoted to its present use. 
The regulations at present in use by the government of the college were promul- 
gated in August, 1887. 
For enrollment as a pupil the applicant must not be less than 14 years of age, he 
must have completed a satisfactory primary education, and if a minor must be 
presented by his father or guardian. 
The following is the course of study: Arithmetic, fiscal accounts, bookkeeping, 
commercial correspondence, commercial geography, political economy, theory of 
credit, international law, diplomatic correspondence and usage, commercial, con- 
sular, and maritime law, administrative and constitutional law, practical knowledge 
of national and foreign finance, commercial chemistry, commercial handwriting, 
history, and particularly that of Mexico, statistics and history of commerce, finan- 
cial, banking, and exchange operations, Spanish, French, English, and German 
languages. ‘ 
There is a library of about 5,000 volumes for use of the students.

NATIONAL SCHOOL OF FINE ARTS. 
In 1781 arrangements were made preparatory to establishing a school of art, and 
on November 5 of that year drawing classes ‘vere opened, a fund for their main- 
tenance haying been provided chiefly by private donations and subscriptions from 
the mining interests. This movement led to the issuing of a decree by Charles UI, 
of Spain, in December, 1783, for the foundation of an academy of art, which was 
duly opened on November 4, 1785, rooms haying been provided for it in the mint, 
In 1791 the academy was removed to an ancient building which had been used as a 
hospital, where it remained until 1825, when the building and neighboring houses 
which it now occupies were purchased for its use for the sum of $76,000. Since the 
year 1861 the establishment has been directly dependent on the Federal Government 
for its maintenance, and was then placed under the charge of a committee of the 
professors, with a director chosen from among themselves. 
In 1868 a plan of studies was established and the name of the ‘ National School of 
Fine Arts” was adopted, by which it is now known. The whole course of study is 
extended over ten years, five years preparatory and five years advanced. The pro- 
gramme for preparatory studies, some of which are also taught in the National 
Preparatory School, is as follows: 
Spanish, Italian, and French languages, figure drawing, ornamental drawing, arith- 
metic, algebra and elementary geometry, preparative drawing from plaster casts, 
landscape drawing, drawing from classic models, anatomy, geography, sketching 
from nature, general and national history, natural history, and history of art. 
The advanced studies are: 
Section of painting: Study of light and shade, classic studies, drawing from the 
nude, copying pictures, sketching in colors from nature, history of fine arts. 
Landscape painting: Elements of coloring, studies from nature, landscape and 
figure drawing, drawing of classic orders of architecture, anatomy, painting land- 
scapes and figures, composition, history, and wsthetics of the fine arts 
Section of sculpture: Studies of the antique and living model, composition, anat- 
omy, history and esthetics of the fine arts, and the execution of studies in marble 
and metal. 
Section of ornamental modeling: Copies of ornaments, drawing from plaster casts, 
anatomy, classic architectural studies, studies of still life, drawing from nature, his- 
tory of the fine arts, composition of ornaments of every style, and practical work in 
plaster, alabaster, marble, and wood. 
Section of line engraving and sketching: Use of burin and etching lines, prepara- 
tion of backgrounds, field and drapery, drawing from the uude, pen sketching, burin 
and etched copies of pictures, engraving figures burin and etched, drawing from 
paintings and from nature, composition, history of the fine arts. 
Section of mezzotint engraving: Studies of heads and casts of figures, engraving 
from the antique and from prints, anatomy, classic architectural studies, historical 
elements of heraldry, letter engraving and from ornamental models, historical 
models, drawing, composition and drawing from the nude, history, and history of 
the fine arts. 
Section of architecture: For entry into this branch the pupils must have studied 
in the National Preparatory School and have passed a successful examination in 
mathematics, French, English, physics, cosmography, chemistry, geography, and 
history. The course in the academy consists of the following studies: Mechanics, 
descriptive geometry, elements of mineralogy and geology, study of the classic and 
other orders of architecture, and drawing of representations of the different orders, 
mechanics as applied to building, stereotomy, perspective, history of the fine arts, 
practical topography, composition, laws relating to architecture, estimates, and sur- 
veying. 
There are also night classes for industrial and mechanical drawing. These are 
intended especially for mechanics and artisans, who are taught the styles adapted 
to their various trades and employments. =

    EDUCATION IN MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA. 651 
Artists and amateurs are permitted the free use of the school and art galleries for 
the purpose of study, or to copy the works contained therein. 
Periodical exhibitions are held of the works of the pupils. On November 5, 1881, 
the twentieth exhibition was opened, which was also intended to celebrate the one 
hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the institution. 
Annual examinations are held and prizes awarded, consisting of medals and diplo- 
mas. The works to which prizes are awarded are retained for the benefit of the 
school, and their owners are compensated by a payment not exceeding $400, the 
amount being fixed by the committee which awards the prizes, 
According to the latest reports there are nearly 1,000 pupils enrolled, the majority 
of whom are men. 
There is an excellent library containing several thousand volumes on architecture 
and the fine arts for use of the students. 
The gallery of paintings contains many treasures of art. Among those by Euro- 
pean artists are works of Zurbaran, Murillo, Rubens, Correggio, Velasquez, Leo- 
nardo da Vinci, and other masters. Mexican artists are represented by works of José 
and Louis Juarez, Echanove, Rodriguez, Arteaga, Cabrera, Parra, Baltazar de Chave, 
and many others. The sculpture galleries contain a good collection of the works of 
the celebrated sculptors, including many of the modern Mexican school, and a large 
number of plaster casts of famous statues and architectural works for the use of the 
students. The galleries of engravings and architectural prints and drawings are 
also magnificent. 
Mexico presents great opportunities for the student of art, as the churches through- 
out the country contain pictures of great merit, and the picturesque landscapes, 
architecture, and street scenes afford good material for artistic study. 
NATIONAL CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC. 
This institution was founded in 1866 by members of the Mexican Philharmonic 
Society, and was supported by voluntary subscriptions and subventions from the 
Government until January, 1877, when the Government assumed full charge of the 
establishment, and indemnified the Philharmonic Society for all the funds it had 
expended upon it. In 1883 the institution and course of study was reorganized, 
and the plan of study adopted which has been in use ever since. The course is divided 
into the following classes: Preparatory, instrumental, higher technical, united stud- 
ies, auxiliary studies, and finishing. 
The subjects taught are elements of musical theory and preliminary knowledge of 
harmony, solfa, choral and choir singing without accompaniment, choral singing 
with accompaniment, and vocalization, knowledge of the anatomy, physiology, and 
hygiene of vocal organs, lyrical declamation, piano, harp, organ, violin, viola, violin- 
cello, bass viol, flute, hautboy, clarionette, euphonium, saxophone, flageolet, bassoon 
and trombone, trumpet, cornet, bugle, sax-horn, tuba, trombone, and ophiclide instru- 
ments of the Saxe system, percussion instruments, harmony, composition, accom- 
paniment, musical esthetics, both theoretical and applied, history of music and 
biographies of its great men, acoustics and phonography, religious music, symphony 
music, harmony and mixed music, musical writing, and the French and Italian 
languages. 
The pupils are divided into three classes—the regular pupils, who intend to under- 
take the whole course of study prescribed by the establishment in the order pre- 
scribed; the supernumerary pupils, who only take some branch of study without refer- 
ence to the whole course, and such pupils as attend the lessons on some particular 
instrument or branch without becoming enrolled as either regular or supernumerary 
pupils. 
For admission as a regular pupil the candidate has to present the following creden- 
tials: A certificate of good character, of knowledge of reading and writing and the 
four rules of arithmetic, or to undergo an examination on these subjects; a certifi-

cate of vaccination, and one showing that he does not suffer from any contagious 
disease, and proof that his age is not less than 8 years. 
In connection with the conservatory, an orchestra has been organized. In order 
to obtain admission to it the following qualifications are required: Good conduct, 
punctual attendance in the classes, best record in the annual examinations, the 
ability to read music at sight, good execution, and instrumental ability. If the pupil 
fulfills these conditions he is admitted, and the appointment is given in the form of 
a diploma, which is considered as an honorary title and certificate of ability. Most 
of the professionals who compose the orchestras in the theaters and opera houses of 
the capital, and the musicians and directors of the military bands, have been selected 
from the orchestra of the conservatory. An official report in 1893 gave the number 
of pupils as 1,656, of whom 617 were women and 1,039 men. 
The Mexican people are great lovers of music,and musical culture is a leading 
feature in every institution of learning in the country. The talent for music is even 
more striking among the Indians and laboring people than in the cultured higher 
classes. It is no uncommon thing to see, in the country towns, bands composed of 
boys from 12 to 18 years of age, which render music in such a manner that even a pro- 
fessional musician could find small room for criticism, or to hear a ragged urchin of 
the streets whistling with wonderful precision and effect elaborate operatic music. 
  NATIONAL LAW SCHOOL. 
During the colonial period and the earlier years of independence legal studies 
were pursued in the colleges of San Ildefonso, San Gregorio, San Juan de Letran, 
and the Seminario, all of them more or less under ecclesiastical influence, the latter 
particularly so. The National Law School was founded in conformity with the law 
of December, 1867, and was formally opened June 18, 1868, in the building formerly 
known as the Convent of La Incarnacion. 
The studies are preparatory for the professions of lawyer, advocate, notary public, 
and business agent; the course is for six years, and embraces the following subjects: 
First year, Roman and civil law; second year, second course of Roman and civil 
law; third year, code of civil proceedings, uncodified law, and first course of medical 
jurisprudence; fourth year, code of criminal proceedings, penal law, commercial 
code, and second course of medical jurisprudence; fifth year, constitutional law, 
first course of political economy, and international law; sixth year, administrative 
law, international law, second course of political economy, and forensic eloquence. 
In order to matriculate for the full course, with right to come up for examination 
for a diploma, the pupil must have spent five years in preparatory study in the 
National Preparatory School, and have left it with credit. Supernumerary pupils 
are admitted without this qualification, but they are not eligible for the examina- 
tions or diplomas. 
In addition to a full corps of professors; the officers of the institution consist of a 
director, secretary, assistant secretary, prefect, superintendent, and librarian. 
  NATIONAL MILITARY COLLEGE. 
The Military College was originally established on a small scale in 1824 at San 
Carlos de Perote, but was afterwards transferred to the City of Mexico and was 
installed, in connection with the battalion of engineers, in the old Bethlemite Con- 
vent. In 1833 it was transferred to the building at San Lucas now used as a military 
hospital. In 1838 the college was reorganized and thoroughly equipped, and in 1843 it 
was removed to the castle of Chapultepec. This edifice having been captured by the 
American forces in the year 1847, the college did not reopen its classes until the fol- 
lowing year, when it was located in the Rastrillo barracks and the building of San 
Lucas, where it remained until 1869, when it was removed to the building in the 
suburb of Tacubaya, which had been formerly used as the residence of the archbishop. 
In 1881 it was again transferred to the castle of Chapultepec, where it still remains.

The college is in charge of a director, who has the rank and authority of a colonel 
in the army; it has a very competent faculty consisting of thirty-five professors, 
four assistant professors, and three preparatory masters who teach physics, chemis- 
try, and natural history. Professors appointed from civil life have the rank of senior 
captains in the army, but military officers appointed to the position retain their rank 
and line of promotion as if on active service in the army. 
The qualifications required for entry as a pupil are as follows: He must be a Mexi- 
can citizen either by birth or naturalization, not less than 16 nor more than J8 years 
of age, although pupils may be admitted up to 20 years of age if they can pass an 
examination in the nonmilitary sciences which form a part of the first three years of 
the college course. He must have passed a successful examination in some public 
school in arithmetic, algebra, Spanish, and first-year studies in French, and must not 
have been expelled from any school or college for misconduct or incompetency. He 
must have been vaccinated, and has to undergo a rigid medical examination and 
produce a certificate from the medical officer of the college of his physical fitness for 
a military career. 
The applicant for entrance must address his application, in his own handwriting, 
to the secretary of war, in the month of October or November of each year, giving his 
name, age, and place of birth, accompanied by a declaration by his father or guar- 
dian certifying that he agrees to his son or ward entering the army, a copy of his 
baptismal register, and a certificate from a school or college of his conduct, diligence, 
and proficiency in his studies. 
Sons of soldiers are admitted as pupils from 15 years of age, who must send with 
their application, in addition to the documents required from other applicants, a 
certificate stating their father’s rank in the army. 
It is understood that from the day they enter the college they are members of the 
army and are at all times liable, whatever may be the condition of their studies, to 
be called upon by the Government for active service as officers in the army. Cadets 
are under obligation to serve as officers in the army for at least three years after 
graduation, and those who are promoted to the faculty must serve at least five years; 
those who are intended for the navy pass into the naval school on completing their 
course at the college. 
The pupils are fed and clothed at the expense of the Government and are furnished 
with books, drawing materials, and stationery free of charge. 
The courses of study for the various arms of the service are the following:

navy: 
First year: Infantry tactics and drill. Military regulations from duties of soldier

  EDUCATION IN MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA. 655 
Annual encampments of the cadets are formed from the 15th to tho 30th of Novem- 
ber each year, at distances not more than 8 leagues from the capital, to which the 
cadets make the march on foot, accompanied by regular troops. During this 
encampment the cadets are instructed in artillery and rifle practice, construction of 
fortifications and entrenchments, and field service in general. 
The annual examinations commence on October 1 and end November 12. The 
prizes, diplomas, etc., are distributed by the President of the Republic during the 
first week in December of each year. 
The Mexican army is an important feature in the educational system of the coun- 
try. The Government has always fostered the education of its soldiers by every 
possible means. In addition to instruction in strictly military subjects, every soldier 
who is illiterate is taught reading, writing, and the principal rules of arithmetic, so 
that, however ignorant a recruit may be when he leaves his native place, he returns 
to it after his five years’ service with a good elementary education, and is in every 
respect a more useful citizen. When it is considered that the Mexican army consists 
of about 30,000 men, the great bulk of whom are renewed every five years, it will be 
readily understood what an important part it performs in the education of the 
masses of the people. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The Normal School, for training male teachers of the City of Mexico, was founded 
by decree of the Government in December, 1885. It is under the immediate juris- 
diction of the department of justice and public instruction. 
The course required for the degree of professor of primary instruction extends 
over four years and embraces the following subjects: Advanced reading, recitations 
and exercises from memory, arithmetic and algebra, geometry, rudiments of mechan- 
ies, cosmography, geography (especially that of Mexico), history of Mexico, rudi- 
ments of physics and meteorology, chemistry, agriculture and natural industries, 
natural history and physiology, pedagogics, logic, scholastic organization and 
discipline and history of pedagogism, Spanish grammar and composition, French, 
English, general history, rudiments of medicine and domestic and scholastic hygiene, 
rudiments of constitutional law and political economy, caligraphy and drawing, 
gymnastics, choral singing, military drill, observation of methods of teaching com- 
bined with actual practice. To afford the necessary opportunities for practice, two 
schools have been established in connection with the Male Normal School, one for 
small children of from 5 to 7 years of and the other for pupils of ak 7 tol4 
years of age. Tho course of instruetion in the school for the younger children is for 
three years, and includes kindergarten instruction, objective calenlation not exceed- 
ing the number ten, rudimentary ideas in relation to the three kingdoms of nature, 
cultivation of language, ideas of Mexican and universal history, and: of moral and 
civic education, gardening, care of domestic animals, and gymnastic games. The 
course in the school for older pupils covers six years, and includes the following 
studies: Reading, writing, arithmetic, Spanish grammar, geography, history (par- 
ticularly that of Mexico), rudiments of natural sciences, civic instruction, drawing, 
French and English languages, gymnastics, military drill, and choral singing. 
The students of the normal school are required to teach in all the grades of these 
schools, commencing with the first year in the junior school and gradually ascending 
to the highest grade in the senior school, for the purpose of practice, and to obtain a 
practical knowledge of the duties of their profession. 
The students who are trained in the normal school must promise to serve as teach- 
ers in the public schools of the federal district or territories for at least three years 
after their graduation, 
Scholarships have been established carrying an annual salary as rewards for talent 
and superior application. 
The Normal School for Female Teachers was established in June, 1888, in place of 
the National Secondary School for Girls, which was consolidated with it. 
     
-P-A-G-E-732
  656 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The course of instruction extends over five years, and embraces the following 
subjects: Arithmetic and algebra, caligraphy, geometry, cosmography and geogra- 
phy (especially that of Mexico), physics and rudiments of medicine and chemistry, 
history (especially of Mexico), domestic economy and duties of women, natural his- 
tory, ideas of political economy and constitutional provisions, theoretical hygiene, 
pedagogics, rudiments of general and descriptive physiology, logic, scholastic organ- 
ization and discipline, and history of pedagogism, Spanish, French, and English 
languages, needlework, music, drawing, and gymnastics. The following branches 
are also taught to those students who desire instruction in them: Bookkeeping, 
drawing from nature, horticulture and gardening, Italian, piano, cooking, aquarelle 
painting, taxidermy, and botany. 
Two schools haye been established in connection with the female normal school 
to afford the students the opportunity of acquiring a practical knowledge of teach- 
ing; one is for boys and girls of from 4 to 6 years of age and the other for girls of 
from 6 to 14 years. Tho course for the younger children covers three years and 
comprises the same studies as those taught in the junior school connected with the 
male normal school. In the school for older girls the course covers six years, and 
includes the following studies: Reading, writing, arithmetic, rudiments of algebra, 
geometry, Spanish grammar, geography, history, lessons on morals and civics, draw- 
ing, 'rench, English, needlework, such knowledge of mechanics as may be useful 
to females, gymnastics, and choral singing. 
Similar rules for scholarships and prizes exist asin the normal school for male 
teachers. 
There is also in the City of Mexico a national preparatory school, in which all 
the preliminary branches of education are taught, to fit the pupils for entrance to the 
colleges for higher education. 
  NATIONAL SCHOOL OF ARTS AND TRADES FOR MEN. 
This institution has been established for the purpose of affording manual and 
industrial training and a higher education for mechanics and the working classes 
in general. 
In order to obtain admission, the applicant must not be less than 13 years of age 
and have finished a course of instruction in the primary schools. 
The subjects studied in the classes are: Spanish grammar, geography of Mexico, 
writing, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, model and ornamental draw- 
ing, linear and mechanical drawing, wood carving, physics and mechanics, chemis- 
try in general and as applied to the arts, French, English, music, and gymnastics. 
There is also a class for constitutional law and political economy. The workshops 
attached to the school are blacksmith and locksmith, carpentry and cabinetmaking, 
turners’ shop for solids and hollow work, machinists’, pottery, stonecutters’, gal- 
yanizing works, and a foundry. Photography, typography, and lithography are also 
taught. 
In March, 1842, the practical school for machinists was transferred from the 
National College of Engineers to this institution. 
The stndies comprised in the course are: Arithmetic, algebra, elementary geome- 
try, trigonometry, elements of physics and mechanics, practical knowledge of the 
materials.and tools used for the construction of machinery, assembling and taking 
apart machines, theoretical and practical knowledge of steam engines, especially of 
new or improved locomotives, practical working and management of steam engines _ 
and locomotives, laws and regulations relating to running railroad trains, linear and 
mechanical drawing, rudiments of French and English, practice and overseeing of 
railway machine shops, foundries, and industrial establishments. Fifty fellowships 
have been created for pupils of this institution, of which each state of the Republic 
has aright to one. Successful pupils are also rewarded by promotion to positions as 
directors and assistants in the various workshops.

NATIONAL SCHOOL OF ARTS AND TRADES FOR WOMEN, 
This institution was founded by President Juarez in November, 1871, for the pur- 
pose of improving the social condition of working women and affording them an 
opportunity to obtain artistic and technical instruction in a sufficient measure to 
enable them to obtain remunerative employment in commerce or industrial business. 
The instruction is general and technical, the former consisting of Spanish, English, 
arithmetic, bookkeeping, writing, drawing, and ideas of science and civics. The 
latter embraces painting, dressmaking, embroidery, bookbinding, printing, music, 
making artificial flowers, lace making, manufacture of picture frames, tapestry, 
cords and fringes for decorative purposes, upholstery, and gilding. 
There is a store in the school where the work of the pupils is sold for the benefit of 
the institution. The Government provides the pupils with comfortable rooms and 
two good meals a day, and furnishes clothing for many who are too poor to provide 
themselves with appropriate garments. In order to obtain admission, the applicant 
must be not less than 13 years of age nor more than 25, and if a minor must be pre- 
sented by her parent or guardian. She must have been vaccinated and be free from 
contagious disease, be able to pass an examination in reading, writing, and the four 
rules of arithmetic, and to prove her good moral character to the satisfaction of the 
director, 
A neatly printed newspaper, called La Mujer (woman), is conducted and published 
by the pupils. 
The average number of pupils in attendance is from 400 to 500. 
  BENEFICENT, INDUSTRIAL, AND CORRECTIONAL SCHOOLS. 
NATIONAL SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND. 
This school was founded in 1870 by private charity, but was taken in charge by 
the Government in the following year. Poor blind children of both sexes from 8 to 
16 years of age are admitted and supported without payment of any fee. On enter- 
ing the school a photograph is taken of each pupil, which is pasted in a large book. 
By its side is written a full description, with age, date and place of birth, and 
quantity and quality of clothing, 
Outdoor pupils may attend the classes and lectures without payment. The blind 
children of parents who are able to pay a small monthly sum for tuition are also 
admitted, and the fees thus received are used for the benefit of the establishment. 
The course of study includes reading, writing, Spanish grammar, arithmetic, 
geography, geometry, history of Mexico, English, French, gymnastics, singing, and 
harmony. Musical instruction is a leading feature, and the course of instruction 
includes the piano, clarionet, mandolin, flageolet, hautboy, harp, violin, concertina, 
and other stringed and brass instruments. 
The trades taught are tailoring, shoemaking, bookbinding, typography, carpentry, 
lace making, brush making, the manufacture of cigars, pasteboard boxes, and mats, 
weaving, needle and crochet work, and knitting. 
Between thirty and forty teachers are employed at salaries of from $20 to $70 per 
month. 
SCHOOL FOR DEAF MUTES. 
A school for deaf mutes was founded in 1866 by the municipal authorities of the 
City of Mexico, but was nationalized in November, 1867. To enter the school, the 
applicant must be not less than 7 nor more than 12 years of age, must have been 
vaccinated and be in good health, and is admitted on probation, subject to an intel- 
lectual trial, for a period of one month, at the termination of which he is either 
admitted or rejected. Only the older pupils use the mannal signs, as the most 
modern methods are now in use, the oral system having been introduced, and is 
taught by teachers who have been trained in the most celebrated European schools 
at the expense of the Government.
-P-A-G-E-734
  658 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The subjects taught comprise reading, writing, grammar, arithmetic, geometry, 
bookkeeping, horticulture, drawing, and gymnastics. The trades are lithography, 
tailoring, shoemaking, the manufacture of hats and artificial flowers, millinery, and. 
dressmaking. On leaving the institution the pupils receive a gratuity from the 
amount of their earnings to enable them to commence business in the trade they 
have learned. 
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL FOR ORPHAN BOYS. 
This school was founded in 1877 and is under the direction of the interior depart- 
ment. Boys from 10 to 14 years of age who are destitute are received, provided with 
board and lodging, and may remain until they attain their eighteenth year. 
In order to obtain admission, it is necessary that a petition be presented to the 
director by the person having charge of the boy, stating that he is an orphan and 
has no inheritance, or, if his father and mother are living, that the father is crippled 
or otherwise unable to work, and that both parents are too poor to bestow proper 
care upon him; that he has been vaccinated and is free from contagious disease, and 
that some person known to the director shall guarantee the safe-keeping of the 
clothes supplied to the pupil. 
The instruction in this school is divided into two classes, elementary and second- 
ary. The elementary course includes reading, writing, orthography, clements of 
Spanish grammar, the four rules of arithmetic, common fractions and decimals, 
teaching morality and politeness, rudiments of drawing, music, and gymnastics. 
The higher course consists of reading in prose and verse, writing, Spanish grammar, 
advanced arithmetic, the metric system, algebra, geometry, geography, history 
(especially that of Mexico), instruction as to the constitution and political organiza- 
tion of the Republic and duties and rights of the citizen, hygiene, music, and 
gymnastics. The trades taught aro lithography, typography, bookbinding, weaving, 
carpentry, tailoring, shoemaking, and working in tin. The managers of the shops 
are expressly forbidden to exact from any pupil more work than is suited to his age 
and strength. 
On the conclusion of the regular courses of study the pupils are given elementary 
instruction in physics, chemistry, and mechanics as applied to arts and trades, and 
French and English languages. 
The institution has between 300 and 400 beds and is admirably managed, the 
cleanliness, ventilation, and sanitary arrangements being especially good, while the 
workshops are fitted with the best of modern machinery and appliances and are in 
every way adapted for their uses.    
LA PAZ COLLEGE. 
This institution owes its origin to the benevolence of a few wealthy gentlemen, 
and was founded in the year 1734 as a house of refuge and school for poor girls and 
a shelter for poor and invalid Spanish widows. During the colonial period it was 
under the direct patronage of the King of Spain and was governed by the rector 
and congregation of Aranzazu. This confraternity was suppressed, together with 
all similar religious organizations, by the law passed in June, 1879, and the manage- 
ment of the college and its property was assumed by the National Government. In 
reorganizing the institution the Government has preserved, as nearly as possible, the 
rules and arrangements established by the founders. 
The school is admirably conducted and is divided into departments for boarders 
and day scholars. The course of instruction extends over six years and includes 
the following subjects: Reading, writing, Spanish grammar; origin, history, and 
growth of the Spanish language; arithmetic, metric system, geometry, bookkeeping, 
correspondence, geography, history, physics, pedagogy, general literature, teleg- 
raphy, hygiene, English, French, music; drawing, linear and ornamental and from 
nature ; sewing and embroidery. 
There is also an excellent library for the use of the pupils.

    EDUCATION IN MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA. 659 
CORRECTIONAL SCHOOL OF TRADES AND PROFESSIONS. 
This reformatory school was established in the year 1881 in the edifice formerly 
occupied by. the Ecclesiastical College of St. Peter and St. Paul. It is intended for 
the education and reformation of boys under 18 years of age who may be committed 
to its custody by sentence of the police and criminal courts or by parents or guard- 
ians who find them to be incorrigible. 
The object of the school is to correct and eradicate evil tendencies and the effect 
of vicious association and to teach habits of order and industry and such useful 
trades as may enable the pupils to become self-supporting and useful citizens when 
they leave the institution. 
It is organized on a military basis, the scholars forming a corps known as the 
“Tndustrial battalion,” in which strict military discipline is maintained. Good- 
conduct badges are given to such of the scholars as distinguish themselves by good 
behavior and strict compliance with the rules and discipline, The most deserving 
are promoted to the grade of corporal, sergeant, and captain. 
Tho literary instruction is limited to two hours daily and consists of primary and 
secondary studies fully equal in character to the national public schools. The trades 
taught are the machinist’s, iron working, brass working, carpentry, shoemaking, and 
tailoring. The*workshops are fully equipped with the most improved modern 
machinery and appliances and are under the direction of skilled mechanics and 
workmen. ® 
The foregoing colleges and secondary schools are all situated in the City of Mexico. 
They have been described and the several courses of instruction particularized, as 
they are fair exponents of the assiduous care which the Government is giving to the 
promotion of education, not only in the elementary and industrial branches, but also 
in furnishing the bigher grades of instruction to fit the scholars for professional and 
scientific pursuits. They are also the models upon which the colleges and secondary 
schools are formed which exist in the cities and larger towns of the Republic. Many 
of these are institutions of high character, fit to be classed with the best and most 
advanced at the capital. For instance, the Instituto Literario, of Toluca, which may 
be taken as an illustration, is one of the most widely known among the institutions 
of learning in the Republic, and many of the most distinguished men of the nation 
have been educated there. Each municipality of the State has the privilege of 
sending one student, who must pass successfully a rigid examination in preparatory 
studies. The institution possesses a fine library and a museum of national history 
and is provided with every appliance for the study of physiology, physical sciences, 
history, chemistry, music, and drawing. The students have a gymnasium, warm and 
cold baths, and comfortable domitories; for all these advantages the price of board, 
lodging, and tuition is only $16, Mexican currency, per month. Morelia, capital of 
the State of Michoacan, has schools and colleges with modern equipments that would 
reflect credit on any country. The College of St. Nicholas, of which the patriot 
Hidalgo was at one time regent, was founded in the year 1540. It has now been 
thoroughly modernized in its methods and is largely patronized. Oaxaca, the capital 
of the State of the same name, has a famous college, at which President Diaz, Romero, 
Juarez, and Mariscal were educated, as well as many other Mexicans who have 
achieved extended reputation and fame. It has an average attendance of 500 stu- 
dents, for whose use there is an excellent library of 14,000 volumes. Guadalajara, 
Guanajuato, Puebla, and Merida are well supplied with institutions for higher edu- 
cation; in fact, the list might be extended to include almost every city and town of 
importance in the Republic. 
LIBRARIES. 
Soon after independence had been won the statesmen of Mexico, in their carly 
efforts for the diffusion of education among the people, conceived the idea of estab- 
lishing a national library, and decrees for that purpose were issued in 1833 and 1846,
-P-A-G-E-736
  660 EDUCATION REPORT, 18%5-96. 
but internal revolutions and foreign invasions prevented the accomplishment of the 
design. On the reestablishment of the Republic, after the fall of Maximilian, the 
times seemed more propitious, and a decree was issued in November, 1867, ordering 
the formation of the library, and the old church of San Augustin was assigned for 
its use. By the suppression of the ecclesiastical colleges and other institutions 
many books and documents fell into possession of theGovernment. These were given 
tothe library to form the nucleus of anational collection, as many of them contained 
matter of great interest to the historian and scholar. The changes necessary to 
adapt the building to its new purpose have been made, and its appearance has been 
secularized as much as possible, both externally and internally. This work has not 
only cost the Government large sums of money, but consumed years of time, and it 
was not until April, 1884, that the establishment was formally opened to the public. 
library now has on its shelves about 170,000 volumes, among which are many 
which are rare and curious. There are also other libraries in the metropolis in con- 
nection with the Government departments, schools, and colleges, the combined 
contents of which will probably bring the number of books in the libraries of the 
city to about 250,000 volumes. Most of the large towns and cities in the Republic 
have public libraries, many of which contain very creditable collections of books. 
  MUSEUMS. 
Museums are established in nearly every State of the Republic, many of them 
being well sustained by funds appropriated by the States, and contain very valuable 
collections, which are being constantly increased. In the City of Mexico an attempt 
to establish a museum was made as long ago as 1786, but without any permanent 
result. The effort was renewed from time to time, particularly after the country 
became independent, but it was not until 1867 that an institution worthy of the 
name of a national museum could be said to exist. In that year it was properly 
organized, a competent director appointed, and the sum of $500 per month appropri- 
ated for its maintenance. Under efficient management it has now become an insti- 
tution which is creditable to the Government. It occupies very spacious apartments 
in the building formerly used by the mint, which is a part of the national palace, 
It is divided into three departments—archeology and history, natural history, and 
the library. The sum of $12,000 is now annually appropriated for the purchase and 
preservation of specimens and for materials and repairs to the edifice. 
The staff of employees consists of a professor of archeology and history, which 
office is usually filled by the director; a professor of zoology and botany, an assistant 
zoologist, a librarian, a secretary and treasurer, draftsman, photographer, and 
taxidermist. 
SCIENTIFIC AND LITERARY SOCIETIES, 
The principal cities, such as Toluca, Morelia, Guadalajara, Guanajuato, Puebla, 
Merida, and many others, have their literary and scientific associations, and there 
are at least twenty such societies within the federal district. Of these, that named 
El Liceo Hidalgo ranks the highest, and is in fact intended as a national institute. 
It was established in 1849, and for some years had a rather precarious existence, but 
since the reestablishment of the Republic it has rapidly increased in membership and 
influence. The aim of this institution is the encouragement and development of 
native talent. 
The material progress of the Republic of Mexico within the past thirty years has 
been maryelons, particularly since railroads have been so largely extended, inspir- 
ing more progressive methods, stirring the sluggish current of life, and spreading 
enlightenment among the people. 
Mexico has seen many revolutions, but none of such momentous importance to the 
nation as that which commenced with the new era when President Juarez reestab- 
lished republican rule, separated church and state, and inaugurated a most impor-
-P-A-G-E-737
EDUCATION IN MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA. 661 
tant forward movement in the educational policy of the Government. This enlight- 
ened system has been nobly carried out by his successors and their constitutional 
advisers, and is now beginning to be crowned with success. This is a revolution 
that can not go backward. It creates its own momentum, increases as it moves, and 
is exerting a most important influence on the national life and progress. Great as 
this influence has been on the community, its effect upon the women has been per- 
haps the most noteworthy. Under the old Spanish rule their intellectual status 
was deplorable. Among the lower classes there was little or no effort made to edu- 
cate them; they were mere drudges, without any prospect or aim beyond a life of 
hopeless toil. In the higher classes, beyond a few showy accomplishments, they 
grew up mere children in intelligence or knowledge. Now no one can study the con- 
dition of education in Mexico without noting how eagerly the women strive to par- 
take init. This spirit is shown by the pressure for admission to the National Normal 
School, for female teachers, which is doing such splendid work in preparing a culti- 
vated and trained womanhood for positions of influence in public education. The 
applications for admission have been so numerous that on several occasions it has 
been found necessary to close the books and receive no more candidates, as they 
were too numerous for the capacity of the schools. Of course it is in the larger 
cities that the effect of education upon women first manifests itself. In every class, 
from the highest to the lowest, the range of accomplishments and knowledge is being 
extended, to the manifest benefit of women both intellectually and morally. The 
result is shown more and more ‘every day in the entry of women into the various 
departments of commercial, industrial, and professional life. It is not long since a 
young lady of the City of Mexico graduated in dentistry and became an assistant to 
her father—a most surprising revelation to those who have known the ancient con- 
dition of female life in Mexico. No better illustration can be given of the forward 
movement of education in Mexico than in the following extract from the message of 
President Diaz to the Mexican Congress on April 1, 1895: 
“Public instruction still receives the special and well-merited attention of the 
executive, Statistical information of the scholastic year last past shows a consider- 
able increase in the number of pupils matriculated and approved—not only in the 
national schools, but also in the municipal and private schools which have accepted 
the official programme or curriculum. From these figures may be obtained a most 
pleasing prophecy, and one that is welcome to all good wishers of the Republic—that 
education is largely in demand, and that the precepts of the laws relative thereto 
are voluntarily and patriotically complied with. The normal schools, especially 
those of lady teachers, have been obliged to close their books and receive no more 
applicants on account of the paucity of their accommodations. The executive is 
anxiously engaged in an endeavor to give wider scope to these schools. The Female 
Normal College established during the month of February a meteorological observa- 
tory; while in the Male Normal College, in celebration of the eighth anniversary of 
its founding, were inaugurated shops for hand work, as also a new and well-adapted 
audience room. 
     
  “An order has been sent for instruments and mechanical devices needed in the 
school of arts and industries for men, which, asis the case with the industrial college 
for women, must exercise beneficial influence upon the condition of the working 
classes, so worthy of protection and aid. 
“The school of agriculture is receiving new pupils, furnished through the auspices 
of the various states of the Federation. There has been reestablished therein a 
course of veterinary surgery, the Government being enabled to remove the difficulties 
by reason whereof this course had been closed, and thus provision is made for a system 
of education which promises to be useful and well paying. 
“Tn order to impart an eminently practical character to the provisional examina- 
tion conducted in the school of engineers, the necessary provisions have been 
aslopted, in accordance with the design of the various curricula in the school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-738
  662 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
“The executive, being determined to omit no effort nor any expense which might 
redound to the honor of the nation and to the adyantage of its studious youth, has 
created an anatomia-pathological museum, with the double purpose of furnishing a 
new and efficient element of instruction to the school of medicine and also for the 
purpose of appreciating worthily the scientific labors which are to be presented to 
the second Pan-American Congress when it meets in this capital in 1896.” 
According to the latest statistics obtainable there were in the Republic about 
8,000 public schools for primary education, the number of scholars enrolled about 
500,000, and the amount appropriated by the Government for educational purposes 
about $3,500,000 perannum, In the Federal District there were 62 private free schools, 
195 private schools in which the pupils paid for their education, and 113 public 
schools for primary education. In the private schools there were 10,355 pupils, and 
in the public schools 21,159 pupils were enrolled. 
GUATEMALA. 
From the year 1524, when it was conquered by the Spanish forces under the com- 
mand of Pedro de Alvarado, until 1821 Guatemala formed a part of the Spanish 
dominion in America. In September, 1821, its independence was proclaimed; then 
followed the attempt of Mexico to annex Central America to the ephemeral empire 
of Iturbide, and it was not until 1823 that the Central American Republic was estab- 
lished. Party rivalry and the jealousies of ambitious leaders caused the dissolution 
of the federation in 1839, and the Republics of Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras, 
Nicaragua, and Costa Rica resumed their autonomy and have since been governed 
as independent Republics. 
From the date of its separation from Spain Guatemala was torn with internal 
strife, and when at peace was under despotic rule inspired by the old conservative 
and reactionary party, supported by the aristocracy and clergy. But in 1871 the 
liberal party, which in spite of all obstacles had rapidly increased in numbers and 
influence, succeeded in shaking off the yoke of the administration that had so long 
kept the country in inaction and ignorance. The liberating army had within its 
ranks a young man of high intelligence and indomitable energy, J. Rufino Barrios, « 
who was elected President of the Republic in March, 1873. He was the Juarez of 
Guatemala, and from the day of his inauguration the country started on a new 
career of reform and progress. Every branch of the public service received his 
attention. The church, which had previously overshadowed the state, was finally 
separated from it. No priest nor minister of any sect was permitted thenceforth 
to control institutions of public instruction, and education was made public, free, 
and obligatory. Before his time a few parochial schools under the tutelage of the 
priesthood were the only provision for public instruction. He conferred upon the 
country an admirable public school system, devoted exclusively to secular education. 
Public instruction has ever since been placed within the reach of everyone, without 
distinction of race or social standing; and not only is tuition free, but text-books are 
furnished by the Government, 
Professional education, which in the United States is not considered to be a part 
of the system of free public instruction, is in Guatemala, as in Mexico, undertaken 
by the Government. The result of this enlightened policy is that the rising genera- 
tion is essentially liberal and enlightened in ideas and is displaying the benefits of 
education, the masses are gradually becoming elevated to a higher grade of civiliza- 
tion, and every insignificant Indian village boasts of at least one primary school. 
The indigenous race forms a very large percentage of the population. In general 
the natives are honest, laborious, gentle, and docile; they accept readily the benefits 
of civilization, and rapidly improve under the influence of education. 
There are at present between 1,300 and 1,400 schools for primary instruction in the 
Republic, of which less than 50 are private schools. There are also 15 kindergartens, 
The course of instruction is very similar to that of the Mexican elementary schools; 
   
-P-A-G-E-739

but in the primary schools of Guatemala the theory and science of agriculture in all 
its branches forms a part of the regular course of instruction. For this purpose a 
text-book has been prepared by Setior J. M. Garcia Sulas, a professor of primary edu- 
cation, which contains all that is necessary to give the pupils a theoretical knowl- 
edge of agriculture, particularly in relation to those productions best adapted to the 
soil and climate of the country. It also includes a short treatise on animal industry 
and on the method of keeping farm accounts. For a country so largely agricultural 
this is a very useful addition to the usual course of primary education, particularly 
in the rural districts, where, as a rule, the larger portion of the scholars never get 
beyond such education as is afforded in the primary schools. In fact, the whole sys- 
tem of education in Guatemala is admirably suited to the country and the people. 
In addition to the primary schools for the young of both sexes there are numerous 
night schools for adults; even the prisons are not neglected, and elementary schools 
are established in them, so that the most ignorant prisoner on regaining his freedom 
has received at least the rudiments of education.   
  SECONDARY AND COLLEGIATE EDUCATION. 
While the Government has devoted great attention to the development of public 
primary education, it has not been unmindful of the needs of the people in the direc- 
tion of secondary, technical, collegiate, and professional instruction. The city of 
Guatemala now possesses not only the largest number of higher educational institu- 
tions in Central America, but the most celebrated and best appointed. This is so 
generally recognized that many of the wealthy families of the other Republics send 
their children there for instruction, instead of to the United States or Europe, as was 
formerly an almost universal custom. 
The national institute for secondary education is one of the best institutions of its 
kind on the continent. More than 500 students from all parts of Central America 
are enrolled on its register. It has a geological museum, a cabinet and laboratory 
for the classes in physics and chemistry, an astronomical observatory, and numerous 
other buildings. 
The Belen Female Seminary, which occupies an old convent of that name, is a high- 
class institution for secondary instruction. It has an excellent faculty, and the 
pupils receive an excellent education. 
There are also in the capital 13 schools for secondary education, 7 of which are for 
boys and 6 for girls. There are also a number of private schools and colleges for 
higher education. 
Collegiate and professional education is well cared for in the National University, 
the Law School, tho College of Medicine and Pharmacy, the College of Engineering, 
and the Polytechnic School, which is modeled on the plan of the celebrated Ecole 
Polytechnique of Paris. The Conservatory of Music is an admirably conducted 
institution, directed by a faculty of 12 professors. There are also 14 schools of music, 
which are subsidized by the Government. The people of Guatemala, in common with 
those of the other Central American Republics and Mexico, are great lovers of music, 
and show great aptitude in learning it. These institutions have therefore produced 
remarkable results. For the students of the western part of the Republic the Goy- 
ernment has provided colleges for the study of law, engineering, and medicine in 
the city of Quezaltenango. There are in the capital two schools of arts and trades, 
one for men and the other for women; also a similar school in the city of Quezalte- 
nango. These are supported entirely by grants from the national treasury. There 
is also a school of arts and trades for men in the city of Totonicapan, which is sup- 
ported by several municipalities, aided by a monthly subvention of $200 from the 
National Government. 
There is an excellent national library at the capital, At present it contains only 
between 30,000 and 40,000 volumes, but it is under able management and is constantly 
being improved and its collection of books enlarged.

SALVADOR. 
Salvador is the smallest of the Central American Republics, having an area of only 
7,255 square miles. Being smallerin size, more compact, and more densely populated 
than the other Central American countries, it has been easier for the Government to 
extend its care over the mental improvement and material progress of the people. 
The upper classes are, as in other parts of Central America, either of pure white 
blood or have a large admixture of it, but the indigenous race still composes the 
majority of the population. They are naturally docile and tractable, and generally 
honest, orderly, and industrious. 
The efforts of the Government to extend the benefits of education to all classes of 
the people are producing admirable results, as the inhabitants of the cities are 
attaining a degree of culture and refinement that is remarkable, when all circum- 
stances are taken into consideration, while the Indians, who form the majority of the 
agriculturists and laborers, are exhibiting marked evidences of progress. 
Article 33 of the constitution of Salvador reads as follows: 
“Education is free. Primary instruction is compulsory. The instruction given in 
the establishments supported by the State shall be laic and gratuitous, and shall be 
subject to the proper regulations.” 
It is to the credit of the Government that it has honestly endeavored to carry out 
this provision and has made great efforts to improve and develop the educational 
facilities of the country. 
The spirit in which this has been done is well exemplified by the following trans- 
lation of an extract from President Ezeta’s message to Congress delivered February 
20, 1893: 
“Profoundly convinced of the beneficial influence which education and instruc- 
tion exercise on all social classes, I have contrived during the past year to extend to 
this important branch the most decided protection. 
“The large number of educational establishments sustained in greater part by the 
State has rendered necessary the investment of large sums in the salaries of profes- 
sors and in the purchase of supplies and text-books. Knowing the difficulties under 
which authors labor in a young country like ours, I have ordered the printing at the 
publie expense of various important works produced by some of the best talent in 
the country. Some of them unite intrinsic merit with fitness for use as text-books 
in our educational establishments.” 
According to the latest statistics there exist in the Republic nearly 600 primary 
schools, with an average daily attendance of nearly 30,000 pupils. The curriculum 
in use has been carefully considered, and is admirably adapted to the needs and 
intellectual capacity of the pupils. 
The kindergarten system has been introduced in the city of San Salvador by the 
muunificence of a lady, and is doing excellent work among children too young for the 
> public schools, 
Secondary education comprises preparatory studies for a university course, educa- 
tion for commercial life, land surveying, and for teachers. For this purpose the Gov- 
ernment supports three institutions, the Western, Central, and Eastern. The 
Central institute, which is located in the city of San Salvador, the capital of the 
Republic, has an excellent library, a museum, a cabinet of physical science, and a 
meteorological observatory. 
In the capital the Government also sustains the polytechnic school, a normal col- 
lege for ladies, and another for young men. 
Higher or professional education is regulated by a law poaeeell February 15, 1886. 
The National University is governed by a board called superior council of public 
instruction, and is in charge of a rector and well selected faculty. 
The classes comprise pharmacy and natural science, medicine and surgery, law, and 
civil engineering. The course of study necessary for graduation is, in pharmacy and    
   
-P-A-G-E-741
_ EDUCATION IN MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA. 665 
natural science, three years; medicine and surgery, six years; and law, seven years; 
topographical engineering, three years; and in the departments of architecture, 
mechanical engineering, and bridges and roads, four years. 
There is also at the capital a national college for the higher education of women. 
A good public library and free reading room has been established, and occupies 
commodious apartments in the building of the National University. 
There are also in different parts of the country the following private colleges for 
secondary education: In the city of San Salvador, the Salvadorean Lyceum, Santa 
Teresa College for girls, and a theological seminary. At New San Salvador there are 
two colleges for males, San Louis and the Sacred Heart, and one for girls called Santa 
Teresa. At Lacatecoluca, capital of the department of La Paz, there is one, and one 
in each of the following cities: San Vincente, Sensonate, Usulutan, and Acuachapan. 
In the city of San Salvador there is an excellent asylum and industrial school for 
orphans of both sexes, where they not only receive a good primary education, but the 
boys are taught carpentry, shoemaking, and other trades, and the girls the occupa- 
tions adapted to their sex; there are also classes in music and electric telegraphy. 
  HONDURAS. 
Honduras is much larger than Salvador, having an area of about 45,000 square 
miles, but it is much more sparsely populated, as the number of inhabitants is only 
about 440,000. 
Previous to 1876, when President Marco A. Soto assumed the functions of Provi- 
sional President, very little had been done to promote the cause of public education, 
but under his administration and that of his successor, President Louis Bogran, who 
was elected in 1883, great efforts have been made to extend educational facilities both 
in the primary and higher grades. These would have produced much mure satisfac- 
tory results if the country had not suffered from the series of revolutions and political 
troubles through which it has passed, particularly since the expiration of the term 
of office of President Bogran, in 1891. 
According to the provisions of the constitution, primary instruction is obligatory, 
secular, and free. No minister of any religious sect is permitted to preside over or 
teach in any school or college supported or subsidized by the State. The latest sta- 
tistics give the number of primary schools in the Republic as 640, with an annual 
attendance of 23,000 pupils. The course of study in these schools is well arranged, 
the pupils are docile and display considerable aptitude for acquiring the rudiments 
of education, and the results obtained are very promising for the intellectual eleva- 
tion of the population. fe 
There is at the capital of each department of the Republic a school for secondary 
education and training of teachers, all of which are subsidized by the Government. 
For the higher grades of education the following establishments have also been 
established : 
At Tegucigalpa, the capital, the Central University, with departments of law, medi- 
cine, literature, engineering, and science. In connection with the university there 
is a free public library, which was founded by President Soto in 1880; the College for 
Women, with courses in modern languages, music, domestic economy, physiology, 
and hygiene; the National Scientific and Literary Institute; a manual training 
school for mechanic and decorative arts. There is also a theological seminary and 
parochial school attached, which is supported by and under the control of the Roman 
Catholic Church. At Yuscuran, a college and high school attached. At Danli, a 
high school. At Santa Barbara, a college for higher education, with classes in geol- 
ogy, mineralogy, zoology, botany, bookkeeping, and mercantile law and usage, At 
Santa Rosa, a college of sciences and letters, with a highschool attached. There are 
also colleges for higher education in the cities of Gracias, Jutigalpa, and La Paz. 
 
-P-A-G-E-742
  666 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
With a condition of permanent peace and a consequent return of national pros- 
perity, there is reason to believe that these establishments may become an honor to 
the country and potent factors in its advancement. 
NICARAGUA. 
Nicaragua labors under a similar disadvantage to that which exists in Honduras, 
having an area of upward of 40,000 square miles and a population of only about 
360,000. The indigenous races, who form the bulk of the laboring inhabitants, are 
docile and industrious, and form an excellent rural population. They display con- 
siderable intelligence, and improve very rapidly under the influence of education. 
Hundreds of the wealthier Nicaraguans have been educated in the schools of 
Europe and the United States, and are as refined and accomplished as any people in 
the world. It is not, however, on the education and refinement of a few, but upon 
the education and intellectual advancement of the bulk of the people—the patient 
burden-bearers of the land—that the Republic must rely for safety and permanence. 
There is no doubt that the Government is fully alive to the importance of this work. 
Since 1877 it has devoted great attention and large sums of money to the cause of 
education. There is no lack of either public or private schools, but the good work 
has been sadly embarrassed by the civil wars, revolutions, and political troubles by 
which the country has been convulsed. It is hoped, however, that a more settled 
and peaceful condition may soon be attained, and that the Government may be again 
in condition to devote its attention more thoroughly to the intellectual needs of the 
people. In his message to Congress delivered January 1, 1896, President Zelaya 
dwelt with evident pride upon the fact that he had reestablished and effected great 
improvement in the public schools, which had been closed by his predecessor. Ac- 
cording to the latest statistics, there are now between 200 and 300 Government schools 
for primary education, also several municipal and private schools, with a total aver- 
age attendance of about 20,000 pupils. There are also, for secondary education, two 
high schools for boys and one for girls, well equipped with teachers and having a 
large attendance. 
The National University has also an excellent faculty, with classes for teaching, 
law, medicine, engineering, and natural science. 
In the city of Managua there is a free public library, which is liberally supported 
by the Government. 
COSTA RICA. 
Costa Rica is the most southern and one of the smallest Central American Repub- 
lies. Its area is about 23,000 square miles. The population is officially estimated 
at about 240,000, and is much more homogeneous and with a smaller mixture of dark 
blood than is seen in the people of the neighboring countries, It has had the good | 
fortune to be free, in great measure, from the revolutions and civil strife that have 
distracted the other States of Central America, and its progress has been correspond- 
ingly greater. 
This condition of peace and prosperity has been very favorable to the cause of 
education, and the percentage of pupils under instruction, in proportion to popula- 
tion, is larger than in any other of the neighboring republics. 
Primary instruction is directly under the supervision of the Government; it is free 
of charge and compulsory; but every inhabitant of the Republic, whether native or 
foreign, is free to receive instruction or to teach in private establishments. There 
are in the Republic 200 primary public schools, with an average attendance of 10,000 
pupils. In fact, a good school for primary instruction can be found in every village. 
The following institutions for higher instruction are also supported by the Gov- 
ernment: The National University, at San José, with a free public library attached; 
the high school for young ladies, at San José; the Alajuela High School; the Cartago 
College, and the School of Agriculture. The Government also supports at the capital
-P-A-G-E-743
  EDUCATION IN MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA. 667 
a physical and geographical institute, a meteorological institute, and a national school 
of music, There are a large number of private schools and colleges, several of which 
receive subsidies from the national treasury. The Government has also devoted 
considerable sums for tuition and expenses for Costa Rican boys educated abroad. 
So far as the learned professions are concerned, Costa Rica has certainly a larger 
proportion of her people so engaged than any of her sister nations. In fact, com- 
plaint has been made by many of her citizens that too large a proportion of the 
young men are receiving professional education instead of being devoted to commer- 
cial, agricultural, and other pursuits, more useful in the development of the resources 
of the country. 
The people of Costa Rica are great lovers of music; their taste in that direction is 
not only cultivated in the National School of Music, but the San José Philharmonic 
Society has worked with great success in the same direction and has done much to 
promote the cultivation of music throughout the country. 
BRITISH HONDURAS. 
This small British colony, with a population of about 30,000, of whom perhaps less 
than 500 are of purely white blood, and the remainder negroes and half breeds, is 
well supplied with educational facilities. There are 28 schools, which are generally 
denominational, established and superintended by the clergy of the various religious 
bodies, but a few are private schools. The schools receive Government aid to the 
extent of about $10,000 annually. An inspector of schools is appointed by the Gov- 
ernment, who publicly examines the pupils of each school once a year, and the teach- 
ers receive a bonus according to the numbers who pass the examination successfully 
in the several grades. The number of pupils on the rolls averages between 2,500 and 
3,000. The instruction is purely elementary. :

  CHAPTER XIII. 
THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL PRISON CONGRESS. 
By C. D. RANDALL, 
Delegate of the United States Bureau of Education. 
The Fifth International Prison Congress was especially favored in holding its ses- 
sions in the buildings of the Sorbonne and College of France. It was 4 o’clock on the 
Jast Sunday afternoon in June, 1895, when it convened in the great amphitheater of 
the Sorbonne. The very place was inspiring. History and art had united in mak- 
ing the place most attractive and interesting. As we fronted the great platform 
which occupies the rear of the capacious room, on our left we noticed the life-size 
statue of Sorbonne, the founder of the historic college, whose work was ended cen- 
turies ago, while the whole wall back of the platform was occupied by the celebrated 
decoration of M. Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, representing in life size Greek conven- 
tional figures, in several groups, the arts and sciences, on either side of Sorbonne, 
typified by a female figure. This and the other decorations throughout the halls of 
the great building would be alone sufficient to make the Sorbonne most noticeable 
without its remarkable history. 
When the assembly was seated we noticed that the highest official and social life 
of France and other nations was there to do honor to the congress. France had 
invited the congress and France was there to welcome it. President Faure had 
arrived in his carriage, accompanied by General Tournier and a company of cuiras- 
siers. The multitude surrounding the entrance had warmly applauded him. On 
descending from the carriage he was received by M. Gréard, vice-rector of the Acad- 
emy of Paris. The President was escorted to and took his seat in the gallery over 
the entrance fronting the platform. With him were seated MM. Ribot, president 
of the council of ministers; Hanotaux, minister of foreign affairs; Trarieux, minister 
of just: Brisson, president of the Chamber of Deputies, and the ambassadors of the 
United States, Sweden, Italy, Denmark, and Japan. At his entrance the President 
was warmly applauded by the members of the congress. 
Upon the platform were MM. Georges Leygues, minister of the interior; F. Duflos, 
director of the French prison administration and president of the committee of 
organization; Théophile Roussel, senator of France, member of the institute, and vice- 
president; the members of the International Prison Commission; Galkine-Wraskoy, 
director-general of the prisons of Russia; Beltrani Scalia, Italian councilor of state; 
Pols, professor in the University of Utrecht; Dr. Guillaume, secretary-general; Goos, 
inspector-general of the prisons of Denmark; De Jagemann, ambassador of Baden, 
and many other high officials of France and other nations, including senators, mem- 
lets of the Institute, councilors of state, etc. In the general audience there were 
many distingnished ladies and gentlemen, many of international reputation, many 
who, occupying high positions at home, had devoted very much of their studies and 
labors to the cause which had brought them together from the various parts of the 
world. The opening address was by M. Leygues, minister of the interior. He spoke 
as follows. 
    669
-P-A-G-E-746
  670 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
“Mr, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Your presence in our midst is a most pre- 
cious encouragement. I pray you to accept our respectful acknowledgement. 
“‘Gentlemen, in the name of the Government of the Republic I welcome the for- 
eign delegates who have met here to declare the unchangeable adherence of those 
who have devoted their lives to the pursuit of truth and to the alleviation of human 
misery. 
“Science, gentlemen, takes on more and more an international character. The 
constant exchange beyond the frontier by books and the press no longer answers. 
The learned now go in person to reveal their discoveries and to place in the common 
patrimony the fruit of their meditations and labors. London, Stockholm, Rome, 
and St. Petersburg mark the great resting places, until now, in prison science. Gen- 
tlemen, the work you engage in is one of the most arduous and noble which can be 
conceived. To strengthen repression and at the same time introduce humanity into 
law; to ask for indulgence more than severity, without abandoning any of the 
indispensable guaranties of social order; to revive in the soul of the delinquent 
and criminal the idea of duty, law, and justice; such is the end of your pursuit. 
“Tt appears at first that your ideal is too exalted, and that you seek to attempt the 
impossible. Your generous conceptions are treated as chimerical. You are accused 
of sentimentalism and feebleness. Nothing has power to shake your faith. You 
know better than anyone that there are evils which can not be cured; incorrigibles 
who must be prevented from wrongdoing, but you say that all evils are not ineur- 
able, and that there are reseues which should be undertaken. In your eyes perver- 
sity-is only the exception. You affirm that human nature, at the bottom, is right, 
loyal, and generous. You have never despaired of it. You are right. In the most 
ravaged and blinded heart may survive, as in the ruins of the temple, a last lamp 
forgotten by the last priest, which still burns for truth and goodness. ‘To save this 
flickering flame is an act of justice. Nevertheless, it will not do to substitute for 
the severity of penal law a kind of philosophic indifference which lets everything 
go and compromises the public safety. It should work only to stimulate the moral 
forces, to evoke the generous instincts which can prevent the misdemeanor or crime, 
and, after the fall, to rehabilitate and raise up the offender. Never proclaim the 
irresponsibility of the being who has fallen. This would be to affirm the useless- 
ness of punishment orreward. It is true that the physical constitution, education, 
heredity, and poverty exercise a direct influence on criminality. The legislator 
considers these certain influences in estimating the acts and in graduating the pen- 
alties. On this point nothing has been changed by tradition. But you have inno- 
vated when, breaking away from ancient errors, you have said that intimidation and 
fear were not the only means to secure the reformation of the guilty, and that edu- 
cation and hope were also sure means to obtain it. This simple affirmation was a 
revelation. You have spoken of kindness. You have inclosed a flower between the 
pages of the code. Your doctrine is right. Punishment without the possibility 
of pardon discourages and degrades. The hope of rehabilitation provokes effort and 
elevates. You have put the principle of the theory into practice. But your ambi- 
tion was not satisfied. To repress or to reform is good; to prevent is better, and you 
have wished to dry up even the source of evil. It is these that the international 
prison congresses have accomplished, the finest of their work, in revising legisla- 
tion relative to abandoned or delinquent children. To rescue the child from ill- 
treatment, from bad examples, and from poverty is to fulfill the first of public duties. 
Has society the right to punish the feeble and defenseless being which it neither aids 
nor protects? Offer to the delinquent child a friendly hand, comfort it in its distress, 
forget and make it forget its fault, is to make a good citizen of one who might 
become a useless and dangerous person. This is, then, to serve one’s country, and, 
perhaps better yet, to serve humanity. No one knows how many sparkles of genius 
die in the souls of lost children. 
“It is to your indefatigable propagandism, gentlemen, that reform in houses of 
correction and the development of the admirable work of patronage for the past

THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL PRISON CONGRESS. 671 
twenty years is due and promoted in all parts of the world. This result alone is 
sufficient to demonstrate the philosophic and social extent of your labors and to 
confirm your undoubted right to public recognition. Wherever you hold your ses- 
sions you receive evidences of the most precious and highest sympathy. Public 
sentiment encourages you, and governments hold it to be an honor to labor with you. 
It is in effect that in struggling against moral evils, in arresting their advance and 
suppressing them at their origin, you accomplish a work which surpasses the ap- 
parent limit of your action. In this way you contribute to assure the pacific evolu- 
tion of progress, for society, as the organized body prospers and grows as much as 
liberty under healthy conditions. 
“Gentlemen, may the bonds of mutual esteem and reciprocal confidence which 
already unite you bind you still closer for the good of your countries. May the new 
efforts you will undertake be crowned with success for the peace of conscience and 
the triumph of truth and justice. 
“T declare the fifth International Prison Congress opened.” 
M. Pols, vice-president of the International Prison Commission, replied in the fol- 
lowing words: 
“Mr. MINISTER AND HONORARY PRESIDENT: Permit me to speak briefly, in the 
name of my colleagues of the International Prison Commission, to express the senti- 
ments which animate us at this time, and which, I am sure, are partaken by all the 
foreign members of the congress. We are happy to find you here, not only in the 
quality of travelers, meeting in a beautiful country and in a glorious city, in one of 
the great centers of civilizations, where everything recalls progress, the most bril- 
liant conquests, the richest promises of the future; but as the adherents of a great 
cause, as laborers in a noble work, reunited in a place where the grandeur of the 
work and its high value have for so long a time been recognized, who were certain 
to find a sympathetic welcome and a land rich and fruitful for their labors. 
“The cordial and unanimous greeting received five years ago at the congress of 
St. Petersburg, the vote to meet in Paris for the next congress, proves already how 
much this sentiment was generally prevalent. But since, the facts have confirmed 
this sentiment beyond our boldest expectations. The Government of France favor- 
ably received the choice of location, and immediately all that France had, the most 
illustrious in science and in prison work, gave ready assistance to prepare our work 
and to guarantee to the fifth congress an eminent place among its predecessors, 
How can the solemnity of this day be forgotten, celebrated in this noble temple of 
French science, antique and venerable by name, but also the emblem of the renewing 
of forms which impose themselves on science to avoid senile decrepitude and to 
assure the powerful and brilliant vitality of youth, always reviving with the eternal 
springtime? 
“How can the presence of the eminent Chief Executive of France be forgotten, 
many other officials and distinguished citizens, our allies in the cause which brings 
us here, to take part in our work, to enlighten their knowledge, their hope, and their 
charity? 
“Finally, Mr. Minister, how can your words be forgotten, you who have consented 
to be our honorary president? After some days we shall again disperse, but we shall 
all take with us the ineffaceable memory of this occasion and your words. And this 
memory will form a solid bond which will maintain the union of hearts and spirits 
notwithstanding our separation. 
“But I believe that I reflect the sentiments not only of my colleagues of the inter- 
national commission, but of all the members of the congress, in extending our 
respectful homage and the expression of our cordial recognition to all those who, in 
preparing for the congress so sympathetic and brilliant a welcome, have brought to 
this work and the cause the aid of their high position, their authority, their 
knowledge, experience, and indispensable moral assistance. This moral aid appears 
to us more valuable as we dare to see in it the moral aid of France. What touches 
us in the presence of the chief magistrate who presides over the destinies of France,

672 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
in the words of a member of the Government, is not the expression of personal 
sentiments of the Government. This expression has certainly a higher value for us. 
But what gives it a higher value for us is that we believe we recognize in the 
expression the noble sentiments of the country they represent. Prison work—who 
doubts it?—is not only a Government interest, a simple affair of justice or administra- 
tion confined to the active and intelligent care of officials. It is before all a social 
interest of the first order, which requires the combined action of all social forces, 
private action along with official action, mutually supporting each other. We are 
happily far from the times when it was believed that they honored Justice in repre- 
senting her as cold and impassive, the sword and balances in her hands, but the eyes 
bandaged. This was the symbol of the impartiality and integrity of ideal justice, 
too often illy justified by the facts—the bandage symbolizing better, perhaps, another 
quality of the justice of other times, of not seeing clearly in weighing the fault, of 
striking blindly and without discernment the guilty. Prison science, whose tri- 
umphant flight marks one of the great advances of humanity, has dethroned this 
cold, impassive, and blind justice. Recognizing the fallacy of combating crime by 
severe punishment of the criminal, of mowing tares without rooting them up, has 
changed completely the tactics of repression. Endeavoring to ascertain and deter- 
mine the causes and the motives of crime, it was soon perceived that responsibility 
rests not alone with the author of the crime. It recognizes the complicity of human 
nature and society, the necessity of a complete revolution in the methods of attack 
and defense inthe weapons of warfare. But atthe same time, recognizing the horror 
of crime, the sentiment concerning the criminal is considerably modified. 
“Tf the two noble truths, which have been classics for ages, always admired as 
applied—that to prevent evil is better than to punish, and that justice does not 
exclude charity; that even there can be no justice without charity, as there can be 
no charity without justice—have not been discovered, there has been accomplished a 
living principle of reform. Moreover, this powerful and fruitful movement is not due 
to official initiation, but to the awakening of public conscience by private action. 
At the appeal of some choice spirits the human conscience has awakened from sleep, 
where it was held in secular routine, and has overthrown the idol of a blind and 
brutal justice and substituted a conception more noble and intelligent. 
“This conception, which we may consider as generally adopted, and which has 
exercised a salutary influence on legislation and administration, is yet far from hav- 
ing obtained its full development. And it could not sustain itself if this generous 
breath which gives it life comes to want, if it had no more vivifying heat than can 
come alone from the public conscience, for it can not be denied it has above all multi- 
plied the questions and has singularly complicated the problem of justice, extended 
more and more the ground of study and the difficulties to solve. This congress 
proves this well, but at the same time it furnishes the proof that the more the field is 
“extended, the more extended becomes the number and devotion of the workers. Our 
beginnings have been very modest; but from London to Stockholm, from Stock- 
holm to Rome, from Rome to St. Petersburg, the labors of the congress have not only 
gradually extended themselves, but have received more and more the favor of goy- 
ernments and public opinion. If death has deprived us of a number of our illustrious 
and deeply lamented coworkers, others in incrgasing numbers have taken their places, 
inspired by their spirit and devotion. At the same time the horizon of prison science 
has extended, and the congresses, to which this progress is in part due, have kept up 
with theadvance. If progress has complicated the work of congress, it has, I dare say, 
ennobled it. The way from St. Petersburg to Paris marks an upward movement—a 
new progress. The congress of Paris will be distinguished, we hope, by a special 
solicitude for unfortunate and delinquent children. Thanks to the more and more 
recognized importance of this subject which so enlists our sympathy, and thanks to 
the experience at St. Petersburg, the International Prison Commission, on the propo- 
sition of the Russian delegation, has recognized the necessity of reserving a special 
section devoted entirely to questions relating to childhood. And this will be the
-P-A-G-E-749
  THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL PRISON CONGRESS. 673 
honorable distinction of the fifth congress, that it has devoted itself mostly to that 
section of humanity, which more than any other claims the strict application of the 
principle that there is no justice without charity. 
“Happily, if this congress has a task more extended and more complicated, it will 
be equal to the demand, thanks above all to the moral aid, not only of the Govern- 
ment of France, of which we are already assured, but also of the nation, which has 
taken so considerable a part in the renaissance of the public conscience, in the gen- 
erous and powerful movement which has created penitentiary science and which has. 
made penitentiary work the common work of all those who interest themselves for the 
good of humanity. Belonging all of us to this humane section, which has insensi- 
bly been given, it may be unjustly, too high a place, we greet above all the adhe- 
sion, more and more marked, the cooperation, more and more cordial, of that other 
humane section which interests itself in the triumph of charity. If penitentiary 
science inclines more and more to accord to woman a distinct place, as it has already 
accorded to childhood, it must have first of all the moral aid and cooperation of 
woman in the study of the many questions relative to guilty and unfortunate women. 
Thesolution of questions concerning children and other unfortunates will only be pro- 
moted with the cooperation of woman. The presence of so many distinguished 
women in our midst as delegates and of others in this meeting is a happy augury, 
promising that the congress of Paris will be a new step in our ascending march. 
“To obtain this new success it will be only necessary to maintain the spirit which 
inspired our predecessors,” recognizing that our discussions and resolutions are 
powerless to solve the questions, except indirectly by the confidence they inspire and 
the impulse they give to public opinion. 
“This success is otherwise assured us by the good preparation for our work. 
“‘Mr. Minister, the words of high esteem you have addressed to the International 
Commission are accepted by us with all our hearts as a precious evidence of your 
kindness. Faithful to the mission it has received from the Governments which have 
united to form it, it has prescribed the direction of the work. But for the prepara- 
tion of this work the merit is due in a great part to our worthy president, to the 
employees of his administration, who assist him, to the distinguished men who 
haye responded to his appeal to form a committee of organization, to the Société 
Générale des Prisons, and to all those Frenchmen or others who by their learned 
reports have prepared the ground for the discussions. I will not insist with more 
detail on their merit. Their presence and this place require discretion on my part. 
But I can not conclude without extending to all, and in the first place to our hon- 
orary president, the sincere and cordial homage and tribute of our appreciation for 
the signal services they have rendered to this congress and for their zeal and devo- 
tion to assure success. 
“T keenly appreciate all that my words need to express my thoughts and the senti- 
ments of my colleagues; but I console myself with the hope that this congress by 
its works will offer homage which will be for you of more value than can come from 
the words of the greatest orator.” 
The opening address of the honorary president and the above reply by Professor 
Pols are given to show, respectively, the French and Dutch estimate of prison science 
so far as the addresses go. Their ideas also correspond well with the general senti- 
ment prevailing in all countries among those who have made a study of penology or 
have been connected with prison reformatory or preventive administration. 
The session adjourned on the conclusion of the address of Professor Pols, and the 
foreign delegates, withdrawing to the grand salon of the Sorbonne, were each pre- 
sented to President Faure, who was surrounded by his ministers, the president of the 
Chamber, and foreign representatives. The delegations were received in the follow- 
ing order: Austria, the Grand Duchy of Baden, Bavaria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, 
the United States, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, the Duchy of 
Luxembourg, Norway, Netherlands, Prussia, Roumania, Russia, the Grand Duchy of

Saxony, Sweden, Switzerland, and Wiirtemberg. The President had a pleasant word. 
for cach member as he was presented. The Russian delegation was the most numer- 
ous, and was presented by M. Galkine-Wraskoy, the chief of the Russian prison 
administration. 
On Monday, July 1, at 9 o’clock a. m., the congress met in the amphitheater of 
the Sorbonne for organization. M. Pols nominated M. Duflos as president of the 
congress, which was unanimously approved. Thereupon M. Duflos addressed the con- 
gress as follows: 
“LAapIEs AND GENTLEMEN: It is not my intention to delay your work by a long 
address. You heard yesterday the presentation in most admirable language, by: the 
highest authorities, of the general principles which inspire you in your discussions 
and the highest thought which has given birth to the magnificent work of the Inter- 
national Prison Congresses. I can not, however, fail to make the acknowledgment 
due. I wish to thank you for the high honor you have conferred uponme. I should 
never dare to accept if I were not to be supported by the powerful assistance of my 
eminent colleagues, M. Beltrani-Scalia, M. Galkine-Wraskoy, and Professor Pols. 
Their scientific labors, their brilliant réle in preceding reunions, assure to the presi- 
dency, of which they are a part, a valued authority. The cordial sympathy with 
which they have honored me until now permits me to hope I can guide well the high 
and formidable task you have confided tome. And in the meantime, since you have 
given me the right to speak in your name, permit me to repeat to our foreign col- 
Jeagues the welcome of Paris and France. So imposing is the character of this 
reunion, in which are mingled so many celebrities of both worlds, that I will be par- 
doned for rejoicing with all my heart in stating the general interest which is attached 
to our work and the promptness with which our appeal is responded to. It is suf- 
ficient in the presence of this assembly to affirm that the work of the Fifth Interna- 
tional Prison Congress will be fruitful; that in a few days, after wise discussions, 
your resolutions, prepared by profound studies, by contemplation of the most elevated 
minds, will furnish to penology new light and many elements of progress. 
“From the composition of your programme and the remarkable preparatory 
reports, which will serve as the basis of your discussions, what appears clear is the 
eyer-increasing presence of the moral side of the prison mission, the necessity of 
preventing crime, the science attacking resolutely tho source of evil, resolutely 
decided to repress vigorously, when it is necessary, but considering, after all, repres- 
sion to be the worst. Repression is in effect an extreme means, which should be 
ayoided as much as possible in working for the reformation of prisoners, in offering 
the means of rising again, and, above all, in arresting evil by the thoughtful educa- 
tion of unfortunate children whom penury or bad examples seem to devote to an 
irregular and depraved life. : 
“Tt is thus that questions relating to drunkenness, prostitution, and vagabondage 
take in our programmes a place more and more important. It is thus that the former 
third section of the congress has been duplicated and that all which relates to child- 
hood has been made the subject of a special section. 
“There is nothing, gentlemen, more beautiful, nothing grander, than the spectacle 
offered by your reunions. 
“Ts it not singularly moving to see those most distinguished intellectually and 
socially traversing part of the world and crossing oceans to come here to study 
together the methods for decreasing in the world the amount of crime and poverty, 
which skeptics claim can not be reduced, in order to spare themselves the care of the 
struggle and effort of inquiry. 
“You apply yourselves not only to scientific problems to procure for the mind 
most delicate satisfaction, you do not hesitate, when you truly believe you serve 
the cause of humanity, to overcome the most natural repugnances and the most 
legitimate indignations. You combat crime; but when the criminal has been for the 
time prevented from further acts you consider it is necessary to protect him from

himself, to draw him away from his instincts, to lead him to the light, to truth, 
to honor, to offer to delinquent children a protecting hand which, if it must be 
often severe, it need not be without pity. mt 
“Tn a word, charity incites you as much as the care of social defense. It is charity 
which elevates and which sustains your hearts while science guides you. 
“‘Honor, then, to charity and science. Such is the ery with which I propose to 
open for you the Fifth International Congress. Honor to charity and science! They 
are indissolubly joined here. It is thanks to them that the work of progress and 
peace will be realized. It is in them that we fraternize to-day.” 
This address was frequently applauded. M. Duflos then presented the nominations 
of permanent officers of the congress made by the International Commission. The 
warm applause which greeted each name as presented witnessed, as stated by the 
official journal, the eminent services rendered by each to prison science. The congress 
cordially adopted the recommendations. They are as follows: 
Presidenis.—M. Duflos, director-general of French prison administration; M. Bel- 
trani-Sealia, councilor of state, Italy; M. Galkine-Wraskoy, director-general of 
Russian prison administration; M. Pols, professor at the University of Utrecht. 
Vice-presidents.—Messrs. Braunbehrens, Prussia; Holzknecht de Hort, Austria; 
Laszlo, Hungary; Le Jeune, Belgium; Marino, Spain; Pessina, Italy; Randall, United 
States; Ruggles-Brise, England; Wieselgren, Sweden, and Woxen, Norway. 
For each of the four divisions there were presidents and eight to ten vice-presi- 
dents. Gen. R. Brinkerhoff, of Ohio, was named as one of the vice-presidents of the 
penal or second section. 
The United States was represented in the Congress by Phillip W. Ayres, Gen. R. 
Brinkerhoff, Mr. Lawrence Poland, and Mr. H. C. Ranney, of Ohio; Maj. R. W. 
McClaughry, of Illinois; Rev. Samuel Barrows, of Massachusetts; Mr. Charlton T. 
Lewis and Mr. W. M. F. Round, of New York; Rev. W. M. Pettis, of Tennessee, and 
Mr. C. D. Randall, of Michigan. 
The different States represented were Germany (Baden, Bavaria, Prussia, Saxony, 
Hamburg), England, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Denmark, Spain, 
United States, France, Greece, Holland, Italy, Japan, Luxemburg, Nicaragua, Nor- 
ways Sweden, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Switzerland, Wurtemburg, and Argentina. 
The largest foreign delegation was from Russia, the official journal showing upward 
of thirty names. England was credited with twenty, while to the St. Petersburg 
congress she sent no officialrepresentative. The United States had twelve, while there 
was only one at St. Petersburg. Austria-Hungary had over twenty. Some countries 
sent only one, but there were generally severalfromeach. Some delegates represented 
especially their governments, while others represented universities, patronage and law 
societies, penal, reformatory, and preventive institutions, ministers of state, the state 
prison administrations, prison societies, etc. The American delegation was a repre- 
sentative one. Prisons, reformatories, preventive institutions, and charities of the 
United States were represented by those directly connected with their administra- 
tion. Mr. William Tallack, the distinguished secretary of the Howard Association 
of London, in a letter from Paris to the London Times, writes of this delegation as 
follows: : 
“The American delegation at this gathering is numerous and very influential. 
It is headed by the veteran General Brinkerhoff, president of the National Prison 
Association of the United States, than whom, perhaps, no one in the Western Hemi- 
sphere has labored more successfully for the organization of efforts for penal reform. 
He is accompanied by his valued colleagues Mr. W. M. F. Round and Mr. C. T. Lewis, 
the chief moving spirits of the New York Prison Association, and by Mr. C. D. Ran- 
dall, of Michigan, who has lately rendered that State a model one in the diminution 
of pauperism and crime by means of a wisely administered system of boarding out 
(placing in families by indenture or adoption) and by kindred measures of a 
reformatory and preventive character, applied especially to dependent and neglected

children. Mr. Phillip Ayres and Mr. Poland, of the Cincinnati charities; Mr. Hey- 
man, of New Orleans; Rev. Mr. Barrows, of Boston; Rev. Mr. Pettis, of Tennessee; 
Mr. H. C. Ranney, of Ohio, and General Norrish, of Minnesota, are other well- 
known Americans present. Major McClaughry, ex-chief of police of Chicago and 
now superintendent of the Illinois Reformatory, of national reputation, represented 
his State at the congress.” 
The International Prison Congress holds its sessions about once in five years. 
There is a permanent commission composed of one delegate from each country which 
has given its adhesion to the project, paying the amount required by the rules to 
meet expenses. This commission makes all preparations for the congress, including 
the maturing and publication of the programme of questions for discussion, These 
questions in each congress differ from those of the preceding congress. The com- 
mission also request specialists in the various countries to prepare and send reports 
on one or more of these questions. These reports are printed in pamphlet form in 
the French language and are also put in book form, There were 240 of such reports 
sent in, and they appear in six octavo volumes of over 2,500 pages. These papers are 
distributed among those who are to attend as delegates some months prior to the 
opening and form the basis for the discussions, They cover a wide field and embrace 
many subjects of present interest. The value of these international prison con- 
gresses lies very largely in these preliminary reports. They are generally written 
very carefully, after considerable preparation, by those who are best informed on 
the subjects treated. Because of this preparation they are more perfect in thought 
and language than the discussions. The reports form a unique literature. The pro- 
gramme of questions established by the commission and afterwards reported on and 
discussed is as follows: 
  SEcTIon I. 
PENAL LEGISLATION. 
1. Should the offender be held as a recidivist when he has only repeated the first 
offense? Should the increase of punishment be progressive for each new relapse? 
2, Can transportation, in the’ broadest sense, be approved in a reasonable prison 
system; and if so, what is the special réle it should occupy? 
3. Can positive effect be given to penal sentences rendered in another country ? 
4, Does present legislation provide sufticiently for indemnity from the offender to 
the injured party? 
5. Is there any way to maintain in penal legislation the threefold division into 
crimes, misdemeanors, and violations? If answered in the negative, what simple 
division can be made? 
6. What are the precise facts which should be considered as constituting vaga- 
bondage and mendicity? Within what limits and by what means can they be 
repressed ? 
7. What repressive methods may be adopted against those who, by the aid of false 
pretenses, induce young girls to leave their homes and betray them into prostitution? 
8. For what violation of criminal law, under what conditions, and to what extent 
should legislation provide for— 
(a) A system of admonitions or remonstrances addressed by the judge to the 
prisoner to take the place of conviction? 
(b) A method for suspending sentence either by fine, imprisonment, or by other 
disposition, in the discretion of the judge, but not applied to the prisoner so as to 
render him liable to a new conviction?

Srcrion II. 
PENITENTIARY QUESTIONS. 
1. Is there any way to generalize and unify the conditious of anthropometry and 
to ascertain the conditions under which an agreement in this respect could be 
advised? 
2. Could special regulations be applied to prisons for women quite different from 
those prescribed for prisons for men, which would apply to labor as well as to dis- 
cipline and diet? 
3. Would it be practicable to have a prison system in which work was not obliga- 
tory? Is not labor in all prisons indispensable as an element of order, safety, mor- 
alization, and hygiene? 
4. Should convicts receive compensation for their labor, or would it be best that 
the proceeds of their labor be used to cover the expenses for the support of all pris- 
oners of the same class, allowing, however, to each a stated portion of the proceeds 
and bestowing presents as a reward upon the most meritorious? 
5. In order to influence prisoners as much by hope as by fear, would it be proper 
to bestow rewards frequently? 
6. In what form and under what conditions should disciplinary punishments be 
adjudged and applied? 
7. In the interest of general discipline and the reformation of prisoners, should 
the best or the worst be selected for the effort? 
8. On what principle should the duration of punishment be estimated for those 
convicted who are affected by mental alienation: 
(a) When they are confined in special asylums controlled by the prison admin- 
istration ? 
(b) When they are transferred to insane asylums, properly so called? 
9. Has the influence of physical exercise in the prison régime been heretofore 
sufficiently considered, with reference to the classification of prisoners? 
If answered in the negative, what methods should be recommended? 
Srction III. 
PREVENTIVE MEASURES. 
1. What means can be used to prevent prisoners from squandering their earnings 
on leaying prison, and thus, finding themselves without resources, from relapsing 
into crime? 
2. How should schools and prison libraries be organized so that they may truly be 
of service to the accused and to convicts? Is there any special way to put in the 
hands of the prisoners periodical and other publications which would be particularly 
adapted to them? 
3. What measures may be taken, in the interest of social security, against irre- 
sponsible delinquents and against those whose responsibility is weakened when the 
crime or misdemeanor is committed by mental feebleness or alienation? 
4, Would not an unlimited imprisonment in workhouses, by administrative order 
for adult vagabond recidivists, be preferable to limited convictions? 
5. In a preventive view, what are the advantages of asylums for the curative 
treatment of drunkards, and what are the results obtained in such establishments?
-P-A-G-E-754

Section IV. 
QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO CHILDREN. 
1. In relation to young boys, would it not be well to defer the limit of penal 
minority until the age of military liability? It is necessary to understand by penal 
minority the period during which the judge may acquit for want of discernment, 
with the privilege of sending the child to an institution for correctional education. 
2. In what instances of forfeiture of parental rights would it be beneficial to sub- 
stitute the guardianship of the State? 
Would it be proper, under all circumstances, to confer upon the courts themselves 
the responsibility of deciding to whom the guardianship should be awarded? 
3. Is there not a way to substitute for the unique type of houses of correction a 
series of appropriate institutions for the diverse classes of minors, according to penal 
law and under different names? 
Would it not especially be best to provide a school of protection, an institution of 
first degree, for simple mendicants and abandoned children. What is the most effi- 
cient way to combat, with a preventive view, the mendicity and vagabondage of 
minor: 
4, What authority should have jurisdiction over the condition of children guilty 
of faults or violations? 
For what reasons and upon what principles should these faults or violations ren- 
der them liable to: 
(a) Either a penal conviction and imprisonment in a penitentiary establishment, 
so called? 
(b) Or being placed in a special correctional institution for vicious or undisciplined 
children? 
(ec), Or to be sent to an educational establishment provided for pupils placed under 
the guardianship of public authority? 
Should the age of the children be the only consideration in their. classification and 
in determining their disposition? 
(d) In accordance with what principles and following what process could children 
committed to said institutions be provisionally, conditionally, or definitely liberated? 
(c) Under what conditions should minors be considered as recidivists, and what 
consequences should follow them in this regard? 
5, In establishments for young people, is it not necessary that a large place should 
be assigned to reasonable physical training? 
6. Would it not be well to fix a minimum period during which minors should be 
sent to correctional institutions, in accordance with penal law? 
Is it not proper to decide that in all cases where minors have been convicted they 
should be sent until their majority, according to civil law, to an institution of peni- 
tefftiary education? 
7. How and by whom should dependent or morally abandoned children be placed 
in families after removal from reformatory institutions and be watched over? Within 
what limits would it be useful to employ for this purpose patronage societies? 
8. What method may be used to prevent and repress the prostitution of minors? 
Would it not be desirable that an understanding be had between the different States 
for the purpose of suppressing the prostitution of young girls taken abroad and too 
often surrendered to vices through the machinations of certain persons or certain 
agencies? 
These questions could not all receive like attention. Some attracted the greater 
interest, as shown in the preliminary reports and then in the discussions. 
In Section I the subjects of habitual offenders, compensation by criminals to their 
victims, vagrancy, mendicancy, decoying girls for prostitution, conditional liberty, 
had considerable attention. 
       
     
-P-A-G-E-755
    THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL PRISON CONGRESS. 679 
In Section II the Bertillion system, prison discipline for women, prison labor, 
rewards and punishments, and criminal insanity were discussed mostly. 
In Section III aid to discharged prisoners, prison schools and libraries, intemper- 
ance and inebriate asylums were considered principally. 
In Section IV parental responsibility, the forfeiture of parental rights, the classifi- 
cation, supervision, and disposition of dependent and delinquent children were 
warmly discussed and with probably more interest than were any of the subjects in 
the other divisions. Many of the ablest debaters and writers were in this section, 
and in point of ability it was second to none. 
It would be impossible in this paper to give even an abstract of the discussions on 
each subject. Some selections will be made from the discussions and preliminary 
reports relating to some of the more important questions of the programme. 
The discussions were first in the four sections in separate rooms in the College of 
France, in the forenoon of each day. In the afternoon the sections united in a 
general assembly and, hearing the reports from the secretaries of the sessions, 
rediscussed to a greater or less extent the resolutions adopted by the sections, and 
adopted or modified the conclusion reached by the sections. The reports of the sec- 
tions were generally approved by the general assembly. These conclusions will be 
given in this report as finally adopted. 
  DISCUSSIONS AND PAPERS IN SECTION I. 
PENAL LEGISLATION. 
The president of Section I was M. Fuchs, private counselor of finances and presi- 
dent of the Society of Patronage of the Grand Duchy of Baden. He was ably 
supported by nine vice-presidents from Greece, Hamburg, Russia, Italy, Switzer- 
land, Prussia, Holland, and Austria and four most competent secretaries headed by 
M. Robinquet, advocate for the State council and the court of appeals. There was 
in this section a marked attendance of jurists, statesmen, magistrates of all grades, 
professors of law, advocates, etc., all of whom were most competent to discuss the 
philosophy of penal law, the language and construction of statutes and the effects 
of their application. 
WHO ARE RECIDIVISTS? 
The first question in this section refers to the recidivist, a new word in penology 
and especially so in the English language, and the question itself asks what consti- 
tutes one—whether repeating the same offense makes him a recidivist. The second 
part of the question is whether the penalty should increase with each offense, This 
subject in Europe is of far greater importance than in America at present and has 
consequently been more considered there and more provision has been made there to 
prevent relapse into crime. The prison population of Europe is so largely made up 
from old offenders that every effort is made to provide against the repetitiow of 
crime. 
There were eleven reports submitted on this double question: two English, one 
Spanish, one American, four French, one Greek, one Dutch, and one Italian. 
In the discussion some of the more prominent speakers held that where the first 
offense was a graye one and asecond was committed the person should be considered a 
recidivist. By the second offense he had shown himself to be dangerous to society. 
In presence of the fact of the first crime he could not be considered as a first offender. 
He is in decided revolt against the law, whatever be the diversity of his acts. 
On the other hand, a less number of speakers favored the theory of special recidi- 
vists, especially in the case of minor offenses. .They claimed that law should be more 
indulgent, reserving its severity for the habitual criminal. Different members, and 
especially the Russians, took this view. In their opinion the concurrence of similar 
violations was not sufficient to place the offender in the state of recidivism, for this 
 
-P-A-G-E-756
  680 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
concurrence might be accidental. It is necessary that among the diverse violations 
there should be not only a material identity, but above all they should be instigated 
by the same motive; and only then can it be said that the criminal instincts are 
deeply rooted in the delinquent. 
Another opinion was presented relative to a different class of professionals, who 
renounce work and live at the expense of others, and for whom crime is a profession. 
All their actions are antisocial. These are without question special recidivists. 
There was an animated discussion on the point whether progressive increase of pen- 
alties should be obligatory on the judge. Some claimed the greatest latitude for 
the judge. On the other hand, it was claimed that the judge was too much influ- 
enced by limited importance of the case before him and did not consider sufficiently 
the criminal tendencies revealed. It is important to limit the power of the judge 
in a way to prevent too many short sentences, which are the principal cause of recidi- 
vism. It is better to put professional delinquents out of power to injure by elimi- 
nating them from society for along period. A proper measure against them is sen- 
tence on indeterminate sentence. Individual characters vary,and the judge can 
most properly determine the character of the prisoner by his antecedents, while the 
law can name the number of convictions from which the offender can be named a 
recidivist, or a professional. These were some of the various ideas presented on this 
subject. 
     
TRANSPORTATION. 
The discussion of the second question in Section I, relative to transportation, was 
somewhat spirited and interesting. This subject was before the congress of Stock- 
holm and St. Petersburg. It was a surprise to the congress that the Russian dele- 
gates did not defend the system—in fact, disapproved of it in many respects—and the 
defense rested mainly with France, which adheres to the system in theory and 
practice. 
M. Babinet, for France, defended it. He said that transportation was not a theory ; 
that it was a fact; that several nations had practiced it for a long time, and that it 
has entered into their systems of repression. He said that France had transported 
criminals for forty years and desired to continue the system, which was improving, 
and that foreign delegates should not discourage the French administration in its 
efforts in that direction. 
The Italian members took no part in the discussion. Speaking for Germany, 
Dr. Starke recalled the fact that at the beginning of the century Germany, which 
he represented, had attempted to put transportation into practice in accordance with 
a convention with Russia. Since then it has definitely renounced the system, and 
to colonize its African possessions will only have recourse to free emigration. But 
the institution was violently and ably attacked by M. Prins, of Belgium. He claimed 
that every people who had attempted to colonize with convicts had miserably failed, 
notably France, in New Caledonia and Guiana, and Russiain Siberia. Only England for 
atime succeeded. Then the violent protests of the free colonists compelled the home 
Government to discontinue the system, and Australia increased remarkably in pros- 
perity. Besides, if transportation is to an unhealthy climate, it is to a slow death. 
You can not send the dregs of the population to develop a colony. On the contrary, 
if you send convicts to a healthy climate it is no more a punishment. It is a good 
fortune, while it is a defiance to the honest people among whom they are sent. Why 
place the prison so far from home, so far from serious control? Why not follow 
England, and organize transportation in the interior, as at Portland, Portsmouth, 
Chatham, and Parkhurst? Really transportation can only be employed to prepare a 
new colony for emigration, and then when the country is prepared the convicts should 
be withdrawn. It can only be employed at great expense. A transport costs seven 
times more than a convict in prison, and how can charitable and preventive work be 
incorporated in the system? The system is not preventive of crime. The convict

colony becomes the refuge of all classes who have become compromised in the mother 
country, and becomes a nursery of crime. It is wise, then, not to sacrifice all to trans- 
portation, which has too often been followed by failure. 
The surprise of the day came with the address of M. Spassovicz, of Russia. It 
was naturally expected that the Russian delegates would defend the system. For 
some years a public sentiment has been created, in America and England especially, . 
against Russia on account of Siberian exiles, and the idea has been fostered that 
Russia was wedded to the system and persisted in its continuance and all its alleged 
eruelties. The intelligent student, however, in Russian affairs is aware that in the 
past one hundred years no country has made greater advances than Russia in prison 
reform, and that no country has more advanced thinkers and workers in all phases 
of penology than Russia. And among these no one is working more for the improve- 
ment of the prison system of Russia in Europe and Asia than M. Galkine-Wraskoy, 
the able and humane chief of the Russian prison administration, who has been in 
that position the past fifteen years. He has lately returned from a long journey 
through Siberia and is doing all that:he can to do away with Siberian transporta- 
tion, in which early success is expected. 
M. Spassoviez began by stating that he was not hostile to the principle of trans- 
portation. He considered the punishment as severe, intimidating, and an excellent 
measure for the protection of society. On the other hand, he admitted the great 
difficulty in removing from the convict all hope of returning to his own country. 
This takes away an clement of reform of the first order. Russia to-day is in a 
peculiar condition, which must be considered. The nation has advanced rapidly, 
but has not reached its full development. It was only in 1861 that serfdom was 
abolished, and it was only in 1864 that the judicial and administrative departments 
were separated. It is to-day working thoroughly in prison reform. Until now 
transportation has above all been a means of removing divers rebellious elements 
from its midst. It has been applied to political, religious, and even municipal 
causes. It is certain that the institution should be radically reformed. But before 
that is done another duty is encountered and that is the reform of prisons. Every- 
where in Russia they are in a deplorable condition, and there must be prisons before 
transportation is discontinued. Following the lead of M. Spassoviez, M. Drill, law 
counsel to the minister of justice of Russia, M. Fonitzky, advocate-general of the 
court of appeals of Russia, and M. Woulfert, professor in the Military Academy, 
Russia, attacked the institution itself. They said that doubtless transportation in 
was an ideal penalty, but its practice demonstrated that it could not be 
organized, that it was decidedly condemned, and that in fifteen years there have 
been three movements for its abolition. The effort attempted in the Island of Sak- 
halien need not be taken into account. Its success could not remove the discour- 
aging results from the experience of centuries, It is time to break with the past 
and to abandon a system of repression which has produced nothing, and to return 
to that of imprisonment. 
The addresses of the Russian members showed a freedom of speech that is not 
usually credited to their country. They did not hesitate to attack a system of their 
country which for centuries has been interwoven in their criminal, religious, and 
political system. The total abolition of transportation may be looked for in Russia 
a long time before we shall see France abandon it, but not until prisons are made 
or rebuilt for their criminal population. 
Left alone to defend the system, the French members came to the rescue. M. Petit, 
one of the ablest counselors of the court of appeals, favored the system. He claimed 
that every State had a right to use its distant possessions in accordance with its 
interests. A people that does not wish to submit itself to the system of prolonged 
cellular detention has a right to set apart a portion of their colonial territory for 
Tong confinement for great criminals and incorrigibles. They can in this way protect 
themselves from recidivists and at the same time the colony can receive an element

for its development, if watched with care, so that it does not beceme troublesome to 
the henest population; that it was worthy of remark that New Caledonia had never 
protested against the presenco of convicts, and that at the colonial congress of 1890 
only asked for new measures favorable to tho colonists; that if the penalty is severe 
itis repressive. It is necessary that work should be obligatory and severe, and that 
for the interest of the colony the discipline should be extremely rigorous. New 
offenses should be punished by cellular imprisonment for an indeterminate time 
The punishment should be reformatory, and to moral instruction the religious should 
be added. The convict, so far removed from the scene of his crime, should be more 
accessible to good influences. He is encouraged in his efforts by successive mitiga- 
tions, which after a while will lead to conditional liberation, first provisional and 
then definite, so that he may become anew man. Finally, he is to be allowed, at a 
day fixed, to be restored to his family. How, then, can it be doubted that trans- 
portation should not take its place in a rational system of repression? 
The defense of the system was continued by Professor Leveille, known as an ardent 
and indomitable French advocate of transportation, He had studied the system in 
tho prisons of Guiana, and at the end of the Trans-Caspian Railroad. The time limit 
for the discussion was too brief for so great a subject, but he treated it, however, very 
happily. Transportation, he said, had two virtues—it permits work in the open air 
and it does not exhaust the conyict, and in the meantime it fits him for free life. 
It comprises, then, punishment and redemption of the fallen man. Consequently it 
has a striking superiority over the ordinary prison, which punishes but breaks up the 
family, declasses tho convict, and drives him fatally to recidivism. Whilo the jail 
produces 95 recidivists out of 100 discharged, and the prison 50 in 100, transportation 
supplies only 5in 100. Are not these figures eloquent? Abandoning general con- 
siderations, onc may engage in refuting the objections which are without cessation 
brought against transportation and strive to do justice to the legends with which 
transportation is surrounded. It is true that certain people condemn transporta- 
tion, but in truth practice it by indirect methods, such as throwing their discharged 
conyicts upon other nations, forcing them by indirect means to leave the country, or 
gencrously facilitating their emigration. 
It is equally true that the states which have maintained it, as France and Russia, 
have met with repeated failures. So far as France is concerned, these failures are 
due not to the institution itself, but either to errors in the law or mistakes in exe- 
euting the law. The law of 1850 was imperative because of requiring labor of 
political convicts. Tho law of 1885 on banishment could only end in miscarriage. 
It saw creatures exhausted by life in prisons on the Continent and had not dared to 
clearly impose the obligations of labor, and had left to exist in an equivocal con- 
dition the convicts who considered themselves as free laborers. Finally, there was 
not enough daring to break the tie which held the prisoner to his country, and it 
maintained in him tho sentiment of return. On the contrary, the law of 1854 on 
transportation was remarkably constructed. It contained in embryo two fruitful 
ideas, that which strengthens the penalty and that which assists the prisoner of 
merit, elevates him, and gradually transforms him to a freeman. But not until 
lately has this law been turned to account, which is really the chef @’euyre of legis- 
lation. The penalty has been enervated by excessive indulgence, and thero is the 
attraction to the criminals of New Caledonia. Besides, from their embarkation, 
before atonement, the convicts were surrendered to speculators at a low price or 
even gratuitously. We understand from this why the enforcement of labor has 
been feeble and the support of the men has weighed so heavily on the budget of the 
State. But these abuses have been shown and no longer exist. Recently adminis- 
trative regulations have given to the penalty its real character and have arrested 
illegal traffic. On the other hand, the revision of the penal code suppressed trans- 
portation for political offenses, and the penalty of banishment is strengthened, the 
law of 1854 is maintained. Then a happy innovation has been admitted; voluntary

“THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL PRISON CONGRESS. 683 
transportation is authorized, which permits the administration to allow the convict 
his choice between imprisonment at home or transportation to the colony. Finally, 
to prevent the return of past abuses, it is proposed to establish a superior council of 
colonial punishments, which will supervise the execution of distant penalties. 
As to Russia, it should definitely relieve itself of all forms of transportation which 
haye becomo odious to the nation and retain only transportation for crimes at com- 
mon law called katorga. It implies the obligation of work, without which neither 
repression nor colonization are possible. It corresponds directly to our penalty of 
forced labor, and for fifteen years it has been applied with success in the island of 
Saghalien. It is not proposed to abolish it, but to extend it, and the new project 
of the penal code of Russia formally favors it. Perhaps it would be humane to 
imitate on our part the Russians, who, from the first, permit the family of the con- 
demned to follow the convict into exile. At all events, it is remarkable that, pro- 
ceeding separately, the Russians and French as to transportation end with the same 
conclusions. 
M. Willems, delegate of the French minister of the colonies, said that notwith- 
standing assertions to the contrary, penal labor could be made productive. Employ- 
ment of convicts in Algeria under the direction of the military authority has been 
productive. 
M. the Pastor Arboux, chaplain of Seine prisons, insisted with much emotion on 
the necessity, in a social point of view, to practice the system of riddance in regard 
to criminals by profession. They were not satisfied to be a scourge only, but applied 
themselves in addition, with perversity, to educate young criminals by detestable 
teaching. The person who issues from prison, even a cellular prison, is not for that 
reason restored. In this point of view transportation is most favorable to the 
reformation of criminals; above all, if it is organized solidly on moral and religious 
education. 
After this spirited discussion the conclusion was adopted as found herein, and, on 
comparison with the conclusion at Stockholm on the same subject, it will be found 
that the congress of Paris was the more favorable of the two to transportation. 
This conclusion was doubtlessly affected by a sentiment of courtesy to France as the 
host of the congress. 
The question was discussed considerably in the general meeting in the Sorbonne, 
in which many took part. At this time M. Foinitzky, professor in the University of 
St. Petersburg, who has published an able work on transportation, took prominent 
part in the discussion, presenting this resolution : 
“The congress, approving the efforts to ameliorate the methods of transportation 
asa penalty and as a measure of protection to society, finds that the present condi- 
tion does not present sufficient data for a definite and uniform solution.” 
This was not adopted. 
The attention of his excellency M. Galkine-Wraskoy, the chief of the Russian 
prison system, having been called to an illustrated article in the Monde Illustré on 
the island of Saghalien, he stated that the information therein was absolutely 
authentic, and added that it was entirely true that the results obtained in the island 
of Saghalien were most encouraging. That the island is inhabited only by those 
condemned to exile. They undergo imprisonment with hard labor in view of colo- 
nization. In Siberia, on the contrary, more diverse elements are combined. Labor 
is not required of all the deported. ‘‘I have the right to say,” added he, ‘that our 
efforts in Saghalien have succeeded.” 
M. Fonitzky inquired of M. Wraskoy whether for some years there has not been 
a plan elaborated in Russia for the suppression of transportation. 
His excellency replied affirmatively, but added that it related to transportation to 
Siberia, where labor is not organized, while in the island of Saghalien, as he had 
already remarked, forced labor was rigorously practiced. This view from the head 
of tho Russian prison system showing that Siberian exile was to be discontinued,

and Saghalien was to be the great and distant prison of Russia, is an important one 
to know. The article referred to stated there were 25,000 convicts then in Saghalien 
and 80 colonists, that all industries were represented, and that already 2,000,000 
tons of grain and 8,000,000 tons of potatoes had been produced. 
Among the preliminary reports to the congress on transportation was one by 
M.N. 8. Taganitzew, councilor of the court of appeals, professor of the law school of 
§t. Petersburg, honorary member of the University of St. Petersburg and of St. Wladi- 
mir at Kiew. He was the only Russian writing on the question submitted who advo- 
eated transportation. His report contains a brief history of the rise of transporta- 
tion and somewhat of its present condition. Without making extracts from his 
argument, his conclusions are given as follows: 
“1, Colonization and transportation, united with imprisonment at hard labor, 
and in some cases separately applied, examined in the abstract unite the essential 
conditions of punishment and respond perfectly to the purposes of intimidation, 
safety, and correction. This is why it should not be excluded from the common 
system of penal measures in use at this time. 
“2, But as the practical application of transportation, as shown by historical 
experience, presents everywhere serious difficulties, it can only be recommended for 
states offering convenient conditions, and to a limited extent. 
«3. It would be desirable— 
“(a) That transportation be maintained in countries which possess proper terri- 
tory for its application; above all, if such countries do not believe it possible to 
secure penal repression by imprisonment. 
“(b) That transportation is not a general measure extending to a great number of 
criminals, without regard to individual qualities, but that it should be ordered con- 
formably to their physical and moral fitness for colonization.” 
The jurisprudence society of St. Petersburg is one of high rank, and took a promi- 
nent position through its members attending the fourth International Prison Con- 
gress in St. Petersburg. They presented quite a number of reports at that congress, 
and they were of the highest merit, taking the highest and most intelligent positions 
in prison science. It seems that the paper of M. Taganitzew was presented to the 
law society before the congress met and that society entered its protest against 
the position taken by the writer. The commission of the society, having heard the 
paper read, made the following report: 
“1, That the signification of transportation as a penalty in an abstract idea and 
without regard to experience is unanimously recognized by Russian jurists in the 
same sense as presented by Professor Taganitzew. 
“2, That, on the contrary, as to the practical application of transportation there 
are differences of opinion, and to the optimism of the report this society apposes a 
negative opinion, considering that it is doubtful whether there can be a rational 
organization of transportation in Russia, where for three hundred years it has existed 
and has not succeeded in strongly establishing itself. 
“3, Yet in the meantime we must accept transportation as necessary (always with 
the restrictions named by M. Taganitzew) in presence of the faults of prison organi- 
zation; for of the two evils—a bad prison and bad transportation—the former is evi- 
dently the greatest, and at the same time it need not be forgotten that even the 
existence of transportation ueed not check the improvement of the prison system.” 
M. Taganitzew says of the present state of transportation: 
“The want of enough prisons in Siberia for convicts was the cause, in 1879, of the 
publication of provisional regulations restraining transportation to Siberia to cer- 
tain classes of criminals. The convicts who were not transported finished their 
punishment in local prisons provided for that purpose. But sojourn in these prisons 
without labor and without any classification among criminals took away the rigor 
of punishment, making the prison a nursery of vice. And on the other hand the 
crowded local prisons, without sanitary conditions, raised the death rate to an

incredible figure, so that in 1880 transportation was reestablished on its former 
basis. At the present time the principal kinds of transportation are transportation 
with forced labor and transportation to the colonies for colonizing purposes. Forced 
labor is of two kinds: Sojourn in the islands with work for the State and sojourn in 
the colony. This is accomplished partly in Siberia and partly in the island of 
Saghalien since 1879, which forms a kind of colony for transportation. The island 
for administrative purposes is divided into three parts. At the head is the governor, 
while at the head of each division is a commander. The director of the principal 
* prison is president of the administration, which has cognizance of all civil and crim- 
inal affairs of small importance. Those of the most importance are passed on by the 
maritime court of the division. In 1882, to aid in the installation of the transports, 
women condemned to hard labor were sent to Saghalien. The principal work of the 
convicts consists in opening roads through the vast forests which cover the island, 
in the construction of bridges, stations, embankments, etc. To this should be added 
the establishment of telegraphic communications with the continent, the construc- 
tion of a fort at Alexandrovsk, erecting buildings, steam mills, sawmills, foundries, 
. salt works, and important work in the coal mines at Douet. In 1894 large compa- 
nies of convicts were sent into the province of Amour to work on the Oussouri 
Railroad. 
“Convicts are employed in clearing up the land and for raising crops; but rural 
economy and the raising of cattle do not supply the wants of the prisoners, and pro- 
visions are received from Odessa, in the region of the Amour. 
According to law the convicts, during their imprisonment, are divided into two 
classes: Those who are under observation and those who are in the way of reform. 
In the first class the convicts, in accordance with their punishment, are obliged to 
pass from one to eight years. Then, if they give some hope of amendment by their 
submission to the administration, by their temperance and their prudence, by their 
propriety and application to work, they will pass into the second class. At the 
end of one to three years they can receive permission to live out of the prison, to 
build houses with material furnished by the State, to have money, and to marry. 
During the continuance of forced labor one-tenth of the earnings belongs to the con- 
vict. At the end of this period the convicts pass into the colony, except those who 
are sentenced for an indeterminate period, and they can not become colonists under 
twenty years. 
For further information relative to Siberian transportation reference is made to 
the interview with M. Komorsky, inspector-general of Siberian prisons, in the 
report of the St. Petersburg International Prison Congress, published by the United 
States Bureau of Education. 
INDEMNITY FOR THE INJURED PARTY. 
The question relating to indemnity to the injured party by the criminal was dis- 
cussed in six preliminary reports and in the congress. There is a great variety of 
circumstances where the criminal has injured his victim, depriving him in whole or 
in part of the ability to support himself and family. The victim in some cases has died 
from his injuries and has left a family for public or private charity to maintain. 
A suit for private damages in a few cases will bring relief, but in most the judgment 
could not be collected, as poverty and crime are generally associated. As one of the 
speakers in the congress said, ‘‘ poverty and crime are two unfortunate sisters who 
always travel hand in hand together.” The discussions developed no remedy for all 
cases. That would have been impossible. Simpler remedies by legal process were 
recommended and State assistance suggested without approval. Where the offender 
has no means to pay indemnity the injured or his family must suffer. With the hope 
that further light might be thrown upon the difficult problem, it was referred in the 
conclusions to the next International Prison Congress. 
Among the preliminary reports on this subject was an able one by Mme. Dr. Lydia 
 
-P-A-G-E-762
  686 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Poet, the distinguished lady advocate of Italy. The following conclusions were pre- 
sented in her paper: 
“1. There should be secured to the victim of the crime a special lien on the prop- 
erty of the delinquent, and that attachment should issue in his favor at the same time 
as the warrant for arrest. 
“2, That for certain crimes which do not disturb the social order there should be 
imposed, instead of imprisonment for a short term, the payment of damages by the 
solvent delinquent, and for others the obligation to labor in establishments, and that 
the pay of the prisoner in whole or in part be allowed for indemnity to the victim 
until the debt be extinguished. 
“3, That in countries where it is authorized for certain crimes the accused should 
not be allowed the suspension of sentence until he has proved that he has compen- 
sated the injured party. 2 
“4, That the pay of the prisoner be employed to repair the wrong by indemnifying 
first the victim and in paying the expenses of his support by the administration, and 
that only after that he be allowed to dispose of his earnings freely. 
“5. That it should not be possible for the prisoner to obtain his pardon or condi- 
tional liberation in countries where such practices prevail, and that he be not allowed 
to be rehabilitated if he can not show he has indemnified his victim fully.” 
One of the preliminary reports was by M. Zucker, professor of criminal law at 
Prague. He presents the phases of the question at length, and ends with these con- 
clusions: 
“1, Penal law should, more than heretofore, take into account the indemnity due 
the injured party. 
«2. The public minister should have the right ex officio and informally to order 
_ assessment of damages in favor of the injured party. 
“3, The party injured should have alien on the real estate and a first lien upon the 
personal property of the guilty party, to date from his discharge, so that the guilty 
will not have time to dispose of his property. 
«4, The judge will decide what proportion of the receipts of the prisoner for labor 
in prison will be paid to the injured party for indemnity that is due him.” 
In his preliminary report on this question M. P. Armengol Y. Comet, magistrate 
etc., at Barcelona, says: 
“1, The provisions of law which prevail in our times are insufficient in practice 
to enable the victim of the offense to obtain indemnity. To obtain indemnity it is 
necessary that in criminal trials the court should determine the amount that the con- 
demned should pay to the victim or his heirs, and to realize the same should issue 
a process against the person considered as responsible, as receiver or accomplice, to 
proceed to seize his property, personal and real. 
“2. On pronouncing judgment, if the condemned is solvent, enough of his goods 
will be sold to realize the funds necessary to pay the judgment. 
“<3. If the condemned is insolvent, the damages will be paid out of the treasury of 
fines which shall be created by the minister of justice. All fines shall go into this 
treasury, and the state shall be reimbursed by the receipts for the prisoner’s labor.” 
This last suggestion is a novel one, but will seldom, if ever, be put into practice. 
M. Prins, inspector-general of the prisons of Belgium, was the author of a lengthy 
preliminary report in which he treated the subject historically and philosophically. 
He showed that proceedings for civil damages were provided in most ancient times 
by the Greeks and Romans and other ancient nations. 
“Tn England,” he says, “the system of indemnity, due to Germanic culture, 
existed until after the Norman invasion. It then received a special form of appli- 
cation, thanks to the organization of guilds, tithings, and hundreds, associations 
responsible for the conduct of their members.” 
“Tn France, in former times, the triumph of absolute monarchy rapidly marked 
the penal system with its strong imprint and made the element of public rights 
     
 
-P-A-G-E-763
    THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL PRISON CONGRESS. 687 
prevail over private rights. In the meantime the only legislative monument worthy 
of attention, tho only general penal law before the revolution—the criminal code of 
1670-—maintained the distinction between public and private offenses, public prose- 
cution and private complaint. It decided that in case of capital offenses the prosecu- 
tion will take place notwithstanding the transactions of the parties, while in other 
cases, in matter of blows without serious injuries—light misdemeanors—if the parties 
settlo for tho injuries there will be no prosecution and the settlement will be 
enforced. Thus even under Louis XIV it appeared oppressive to prosecute in the 
abstract interests of society when the private interest had declared itself satisfied, 
“But modern penal law has reversed the more ancient rule giving preference to 
the public prosecution in the interest of all.” 
In remedies proposed, M. Prins finds little difficulty in securing indemnity from 
the solvent offender, but to collect from the insolvent becomes a serious problem. 
He proposes that for light offenses public order will be sufficiently protected by a 
conviction, with sentence suspended, conditioned on the obligation to repair the 
damage done. If the offender pays the amount fixed by the court within the time 
named in the judgment, then imprisonment will be avoided. 
For graver offenses he proposes punishment by imprisonment for a stated time, to 
be followed by conditional liberation under the reservation to pay in a time named 
the damages assessed by the court. In case of failure to pay reimprisonment for the 
full time is to follow. ° 
Though no remedy has been discovered which will be effective in all cases, and 
none will be, yet the subject is one worthy the attention of the American legislator, 
who, it is possible, may be able to secure the injured party further protection than 
he can now obtain through civil process alone for private damages.    
COMPENSATION FOR PRISON LABOR. 
The fourth question of Section II is one that has long been considered by the prac- 
tical penologist: Has the prisoner a right to compensation for labor? This had a 
lengthy discussion in the sectionandin the general assembly. There were eleven pre- 
liminary reports froma great diversity of countries. M. Stevens, of Belgium, claimed 
that the prisoner owed his services to the State, and that the State owed in its turn 
remuneration to the prisoner. By dividing the pay into disposable and reservable 
the prisoner has a notion of saving. In paying by the piece and not by the day 
there is established between the convicts a classification. The disposable part of 
his pay can be used in ameliorating his regimen and the part reserved will assist in 
his restoration on leaving the prison.. M. Crémieux called the attention of the con- 
gress to the fact that the French code (article 41) admits explicitly the right to com- 
pensation for those sentenced to correctional punishment in these words: “The 
products of the work of each prisoner under correctional punishment shall be applied 
partly to the common expenses of the prisoners.” The majority of the section, how- 
ever, held that the prisoner had no right to compensation. M. Puibarand considered 
that the prison could only care for itself, as the expenses were largo and the receipts 
unimportant. In the general assembly the sentiment was divided, but all agreed 
that it was indispensable for the good government of the prison that the efforts of 
the prisoner should be recognized by compensation or gratuity for labor; that prison 
work, to be reformatory, should be paid. Several of the most prominent speakers 
argued that the prison labor imposed was an element of the punishment as much as 
the imprisonment, and that if we admitted the convict had a right to a salary it 
would not be going far to recognize he had a right to indemnity for being placed in 
prison. Labor is a confiscation of the energies as imprisonment is a confiscation of 
liberty. If he has a right to a salary, then he could require that he should be paid 
in proportion to his work. There should be rewards for work. Tho State in grant- 
ing them does a liberal act, but does not execute an obligation, and this is the sub- 
stance of the conclusion of the section as indorsed by the general assembly.

This question has more importance in Europe, where in many prisons a small pay- 
ment is made or reward given, than in America, where the practice is quite limited. 
CUSTODY OF PRISONERS’ EARNINGS, 
Question 1 of the second section, important in Europe, but of less consequence 
here, elicited much attention from the congress: Should the discharged convict con- 
trol his earnings? ‘here were ten preliminary reports, from Russia, Italy, Sweden, 
Switzerland, Norway, England, and France. All speakers deplored the squander- 
ing of their earnings by discharged prisoners. Three systems were presented. The 
first was obligatory patronage. This is successfully operated in the Grand Duchy 
of Baden. In Belgium another system is] adopted. There the burgomaster of the 
place where the discharged convict has his residence has charge of the earnings 
where they exceed 70 francs. If below that amount he can spend it freely. Ifa 
patronage society exists in the place it is to have preference in the disposition of the 
money. 
A third system is one which authorizes the discharged, with the approval of the 
administration, to choose a patron, who shall receive and disburse the earnings. 
Each system had its advocates. , Several warmly indorsed the plan of intrusting 
the funds for disbursement to postal savings banks, claiming they could better regu- 
late the time and amounts of payments. It was objected that the distribution would 
be automatic and notreformatory. It was urged that the sending part of their earn- 
ings to their families should be encouraged. The conclusions show that by some 
of the methods named there should be a trustee for the disbursements of the sav- 
ings of the discharged prisoner, 
THE PRISONS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
The discussions in the sections and general assembly continued nine days and coy- 
ered substantially all the questions of the programme of the congress. The Amer- 
ican delegation was divided in its attendance at the various sections and attended 
together the general sessions in the amphitheater of the Sorbonne, occasionally tak- 
ing part in the discussions in the sections and general assembly. The American 
delegation had organized by making the veteran penologist, Gen. R. Brinkerhoff, of 
Ohio, its chairman, and the Rev. Samuel Barrows, of Massachusetts, secretary. The 
delegation had frequent meetings to decide on the various questions which came 
before it in reference to the congress. It was deemed proper that some one of the dele- 
gation should present briefly before the general assembly a statement of the present 
condition of the prison systems in the United States, and General Brinkerhoff was 
considered a very proper person to do this. His address before the general assembly 
is here given in full: 
“Mr. PRESIDENT, LADIES, AND GENTLEMEN: The sécretary-general of the congress, 
Dr. Guillaume, has requested me to give, in behalf of the American delegation, an 
abstract of the special reformatory methods in our country, and particularly the 
Elmira system, which is being adopted in our States. It is interesting to notice that 
the three great prison systems of the world have their origin in America, 
“1, The cellular or Pennsylvania system, which has been so eloquently defended 
in this congress, and which has been so largely developed in Europe, was first intro- 
duced in Philadelphia sixty years ago. This system still prevails there and is 
administered in an able manner, but it has been abandoned in all other prisons of 
our country. We do not believe in it except for prisoners awaiting trial or in other 
exceptional cases. 
‘2. The system for work in common during the day and cellular separation at 
night had its origin in the State prison at Auburn, N. Y., fifty years ago. This system 
is substantially universal in America for prisoners condemned for a term of years, 
' for life, and for recidivists and incorrigibles.

THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL PRISON CONGRESS. 689 
“<3, The Elmira system is based on indeterminate sentence and conditional lib- 
eration. This liberation is known by the term of ‘conditional discharge,’ and is 
obtained by a system of good or bad marks and a progressive classification. It is 
only applied to adults under 30 years of age and to those convicted for the first 
offense, This system was first introduced at Elmira in 1876 under the administration 
of that prince of prison science, Mr. Z. R. Brockway, and the results obtained have 
been highly satisfactory, and results, after all, are the only proofs of the excellence 
of a system. 
“The Elmira prison contains 1,200 prisoners, which is 400 more than a reforma- 
tory should have. In the last six years the prison has had on an average oyer 800 
prisoners. It has been shown after a conscientious examination that 82 out of each 
100 discharged prisoners have become honest and respectable citizens. 
“The prisons of the United States compare favorably with those of Europe. In 
the treatment of prisoners serving out short sentences, the arrested awaiting trial, 
and discharged prisoners, England and Ireland are in advance of us; but in other 
respects we do not fear comparison, and in some we are in the advance. In Europe 
intimidation and repression seem to be dominating ideas toward the criminal classes ; 
with us they are reform and prevention. We have repudiated the idea of lex tali- 
onis. In the time of Moses, under the conditions then existing, this system may 
have been better; but to-day we live inspired by the lessons of the Divine Nazarene, 
who said that love and not hate should be our guide. In our work with criminals 
we have in view the protection of society, but all punishment inflicted on a prisoner 
for other motives is considered as a wrong against the natural rights of man. We 
believe in intimidation if that alone can protect society. In the State of Ohio if a 
man is condemned for the third time we consider him as an habitual criminal and 
sentence him for life. For incorrigible drunkards we have enacted a law giving the 
judge authority for the first offense to sentence in his discretion; for the second the 
penalty is double the first, for the third double the second, and for the fourth impris- 
onment for three years, with the privilege of conditional liberation in case of good 
conduct. Finally, we believe that reform and prevention are the means to employ 
to reduce crime. : 
“For criminal minors we have reformatories, generally called industrial schools, 
from whence they go out and may become, on the average, as good citizens as those 
who go from the common schools. But above all we believe that it is our duty to give 
to our children in the public schools an education which trains the hand and heart 
as well as the head. The State should add to each public school a kindergarten for 
children below 6 years of age. Do this and the number of criminals, which 
increases in all countries, will greatly diminish and we will enter a better era in the 
history of the world.” 
The address was very cordially applauded. 
The Rey. Samuel Barrows, an American official delegate, addressed the general 
assembly and presented some interesting details on the probation system in opera- 
tion in his country, which is the origin of the conditional sentence system in vogue 
in Europe. The idea dates from 1870 in the State of Massachusetts, where they 
adopted the plan to release certain prisoners conditionally on the request of persons 
who interested themselves in their behalf. In 1878 the State took the place of these 
petitioners and enacted a law providing for a special officer attached to the city and 
town courts, who was named by the president of the court and paid out of the 
public treasury. They are known as ‘‘ probation officers.” They make an inquiry 
when a person is arrested as to his antecedents and his family, his occupation, which 
inquiry is made rather in the spirit of charity. When the investigation is held the 
trial takes place and the judgment is pronounced. The sentence can be pronounced 
at the expiration of the probation, or even before. The officer is a true assistant 
to his protégé, the prisoner. This system is extended to habitual drunkards. The 
results have been excellent, not only in America, but in Belgium, where the number 
of conditionally convicted recidivists has fallen to 3 in 100.‘

  690 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Mr. Heyman, Mr. Ayres, and Mr. Poland, of the United States delegation, spoke at 
different times in Section IV, taking advanced grounds in reference to the better 
methods for the protection of children. 
Mr. Randall, one of the United States official delegates, had presented to the con- 
ress a preliminary report on the subject of the ‘‘ Forfeiture of parental rights,” 
especially relating to the practice in England and America in the courts, showing the 
general rule adopted in both countries. The subject is one of great interest in all 
countries, and has been considerably discussed in the Société Genérale des Prisons 
of France and in the Senate and House of Deputies of that country. Some extracts 
will be made from the report in the discussions of the fourth division. 
THE CHILDREN. 
As stated in one of the opening addresses of tho congress, the commission, recog- 
nizing the special importance of problems relating to dependent and delinquent 
children, had added a new section to the programme, to be known as Section IV, 
relating entirely to children. The great interest in this department is shown by the 
number of preliminary reports, eighty in all, and more than in any other section. | 
Among the writers were some of the most accomplished and celebrated specialists. 
The names of Bonjean, Beltrani-Scalia, Rouselle, Moldenhauer, Voisin, and Joly are 
mentioned as known to the writer, and there were many others equally distinguished. 
It is more and more recognized that the most fruitful field for prison reform lies in 
preventing pauperism and crime by the care and education of exposed dependent 
and delinquent children. In that field there is always hope. The reform of pris- 
oners, the supervision of discharged prisoners by patronage socicties, are excellent 
works in their way and will always be necessary, for there always will be criminals, 
But the highest social science is to keep the prison population down to the lowest 
number by preventing the young from becoming criminals. There were seven pre- 
liminary reports on the second question of Section IV. The longest report, anda 
very able one, was by Dr. Alex. de Moldenhauer, judge of the city court of War- 
saw, and a noted writer on various social questions. His report covers about one 
hundred octavo pages and was very thorough in the history, philosophy, and experi- 
ence in child saving. The whole report is most valuable reading, but only part of 
his conclusions can be given. In closing he recommends congress to say that: 
“The congress, in continuation of the resolutions passed by the congresses of 
Rome and St. Petersburg, which definitely recognized it to be not only the right but 
the duty of the State to prevent the pernicious influence of the parents or guard- 
jans on their children or wards, is of the opinion that tho right of guardianship of 
the State over minors should replace the guardianship of the parents or guardians 
during their minority.” 
This he applies to cases where the parents or guardians have been convicted of 
capital offenses, or for a long term of imprisonment, or for certain offenses against 
the children, or for other acts proving the parents are unworthy or incompetent to 
perform their duties, or for complicity with their children in crime, and, above all, 
when they encourage or force their children to criminal acts, and for various other 
and somewhat similar reasons. 
In one resolution he asks the congress to express its desire that for all minors who 
come in question and for whom the State will replace the parental authority there 
should be established absolutely distinct institutions for each class. 
Another he recommends is: ‘‘ The congress expresses the opinion that the decision 
concerning the forfeiture of parental rights and the substitution of guardianship 
by the State of minors should be left either to the civil or criminal courts or to a 
court especially established for the purpose.” 
There is no higher authority on this subject than M. Felix Voisin, councilor of 
the court of appeals and member of the superior council of prisons. One of the pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-767
    THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL PRISON CONGRESS. 691 
liminary reports was by him. It is brief, but comprehends much. He calls atten- 
tion to the French statute of 1889, and says: 
“It is evident that parents who excite, favor, or facilitate the prostitution or 
corruption of their children should not retain any parental authority. It is the 
samo if they are convicted as authors or accomplices of a crime committed on their 
persons, or as accomplices of a crime committed by them, or convicted for influenc- 
ing minors into debauchery; they are unworthy to retain the right of parental 
authority over their children and can have for them neither affection or respect.” 
He says further: ‘‘ But in all cases where the law of July 24, 1889, declares the for- 
feiture of parental rights operative there should be given to the magistrates the 
right to withdraw from parents adjudged incompetent or unworthy the right of 
guardianship of their children and to confer it on either private persons, societies of 
patronage, or public assistance. This authority in the courts will have the great 
advantage of rendering more frequent actions against unworthy parents, an end we 
should seek to attain. It imports more and more the introduction of law to protect 
the child, to place it properly and to oppose until its majority a legal obstacle to all 
interference by the father and mother in the education provided by public author- 
ity.” In another place he says: ‘‘The right to deprive the father and mother of 
the guardianship of their children should not belong to the criminal or corree- 
tional courts, but to the civil courts.” In this respect he says: ‘‘My views have 
been modified very little. I continue to remain a partisan of the competency of the 
civil courts.” 
Dr. Louis Fuld, advocate of Mayence, was the author of a report on this question. 
After treating the subject at length and with ability, he closes with these words: 
“1, When the parental authority is declared forfeited the legislature can estab- 
lish supervision and guardianship by the State over the parents in all cases where 
they have been condemned to imprisonment for less than two months for an offense 
against children. 
“2. Upon those who have been imprisoned for a longer period for a crime not 
against children. 
“3, Upon those who by an immoral life, drunkenness, passion for gambling, bad 
treatment, or negligence in fulfilling their duties to their children, compromise the 
moral and physical good or safety of their children.” 
Another preliminary report on this subject was by the writer of this paper. It 
was a brief legal treatise on the English and American chancery practice defining 
under what circumstances the courts declare the parental rights forfeited and sub- 
stitute other guardianship. It is largely made up from citations of court decisions. 
Translation is here given of the introductory portion, with a brief statement of the 
English and American rule: 
“For a hundred years the English and American courts and societies devoted to 
the study of social questions have discussed few of higher importance than under 
what circumstances should the law interfere and remove the child from its parents, 
The law of nature clearly indicates that in its infancy the child should remain with 
its parents, receive from them its support and education, and during this time should 
be under parental authority. The duration of this time and the limits of this author- 
ity vary according to the laws and customs of different nations, But in general 
the child becomes independent at the age of reason. The civil law of Rome fixed 
the age at 25 years after having passed through different degrees of partial emanci- 
pation. In early times the Anglo-Saxon fixed the age at 21 years. During the 
period of subjection the child had the right to support, good treatment, education, 
and to be taught a trade or profession. The parent had also the right to the obedi- 
ence of the child, good conduct, and labor and proceeds of labor. Where we find 
these family relations the best and most elevated their rights and duties are a source 
of happiness, mutual love, obedience, and respect. Is not this mutual attachment 
sufficient to protect the child? Yes, with humane and affectionate parents.
-P-A-G-E-768
  692 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
“But it is unfortunately true that many parents are so degraded by immoral lives, 
their habits and evil associations, that they have but feeble attachment for their 
children, their homes, and their friends. 
“The love of the man and the woman for the frail being they have brought into 
the world by mutual love sanctified by marriage is a love which has its origin in their 
very existence and is strong and enduring. Those parents who are faithful to nature 
and whom evil has not perverted, sacrifice their time, their rest, and their pleasure 
for this object of their supreme affection and most tender solicitude, and for them all 
sacrifices are transformed to joys. If the child is in need they feel it, and will risk 
their health and lives. In sickness and in health, in wealth and in poverty, clothed 
in fine apparel or in rags, parents and children are attached to each other by indis- 
soluble affection. Such parents do not abandon to others the child given them by 
their Creator until they have lost all hope. The reciprocal love of parents and 
children forms the strongest tie which can attach them to each other during the 
minority of the child. When they are so attached no law is needed to protect the 
ehild. 4 
“Tt is only in the abnormal family state that the law need intervene. It is only 
where the parents, corrupted by vice, place the child in conditions where it may fall, 
as they have, that the law interposes and protects the child and society. 
“Moreover, history has painted in vivid colors in all ages that the natural love of 
many parents is not sufficient to protect children against ill-treatment. There are 
great and irreparable wrongs against children; evils which they suffer during life 
and for which the parents alone are responsible. Some bring on the forfeiture of 
parental rights, while others tend to it. There is bad treatment which does not come 
from brutal force and which affects the child in high and low conditions alike. The 
transmission of bad blood isone. The father whose eharacter is low, brutal, vicious, 
given to drink, brings into the world malformed childen, feeble in mind, incorrigi- 
ble, with vicious tendencies to depravity and crime. In giving life to such children 
the father commits a crime not known to law, though his guilt is of the worst kind. 
‘Behold the contrast. Over the fireside where reign love, labor, and happiness, 
law has no need to exercise control. At the other home, where vice, hatred, 
debauchery, and crime hold their saturnalias, is where the little children suffer. 
Victor Hugo, in his strong language says: ‘He who has seen the suffering of men has 
geen nothing; he should see the suffering of women, He who has seen the suffering 
of women has seen nothing. He should see the suffering of children.’ * * * 
“ And where this suffering is caused by the parents or guardians, law comes with 
humanity to protect the child: It is necessary that the child should have another 
home and parents by adoption. It is no trifling thing to pronounce the forfeiture of 
parental rights—rights founded in nature, profoundly implanted in our physical, 
mental, and moral being. But this forfeiture does not come from bad treatment 
alone. In some cases the poverty of the parents renders them absolutely incapable 
of supporting their family. They can not for a long time supply the wants of the 
child, and it becomes a public charge, and is taken by the public authorities and placed 
until majority in another family. In this manner the forfeiture of parental rights 
occurs, and generally in America the forfeiture is not revoked. 
“The courts of appeal in England and America have often, for many years, decided 
many cases concerning the respective rights of parents and child. The arguments 
presented by the advocates and the learned opinions of the judges have shown pro- 
found researches touching the principles and precedents of law and equity, as well 
- as a philosophic study on the natural relations of the parties. The written opinions 
handed down by the judges reflect the humane tendency of the age and have given 
eredit to such judges—a credit which does honor to their spirit and sentiments, 
The tendencies of the courts and of the legislature have been to modify and soften 
the rigor of former ideas, methods, and precedents. * * * If we go back to the 
origin of the race we will find that the chief or king is as absolute in his reign over 
 
-P-A-G-E-769
    THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL PRISON CONGRESS. 693 
the people as the father is absolute master in his family. The progressive sentiment 
of modern times has diminished absolutism in the State and family. People and 
children gradually but surely attain the possession of their natural rights. * * * 
“The English chancery courts were conservative and did not desire to interfere 
with the rights of the parents except in cases of their gross misconduct and where’ 
such misconduct directly affected the future of the child. If the fault did not affect 
the child it was not considered. If, however, this misconduct gravely affected the 
good, the happiness, and the future of the child, if contact with the father exposed 
him to moral contamination, or if the company of the father isolated the child and 
deprived him of his natural society, the court interfered and placed the child in 
charge of another. * * * Modern civilization, thanks to its elevated moral influ- 
ences and Christian spirit, and to the general diffusion of useful knowledge, has 
softened manners and has influenced the courts of law and chancery and the legis- 
ipsbate: et" 
Without quoting the article in full, it will answer to include only that part giving 
the American rule as follows: 
“The right of the State to take care of its children has always been exercised 
with great fitness, and above all where the good of the child requires it the courts 
will frequently interfere to protect the young child. * * * In cases of this kind 
the court will inquire into all the facts and circumstances, then with a full knowl- 
edge of the case will decide which of the parties the child shall be confided to, and 
if it appear that neither should have it, because of incapacity for caring for it, the 
court will confide it to some other person who will be proper to bring it up. The 
court will take into consideration the interest of the child, and will place it where 
it will have better care than with its father and mother. * * * Following the 
English and American practice, but making it more certain and binding by enacting 
itin a statute, the State of Michigan has a radical measure. Under this law the 
right of custody by the father or guardian may be declared invalid in the following 
cases: First, by a decree of the court; second, in divorce cases, where the custody of 
the children is confided to the father or to the mother or to a third party; third, by 
the court of probate in legal proceedings on account of alleged ill-treatment; fourth, 
by proceedings in the same court relative to dependent children. In either of the 
above instances the child may be admitted to the State public school for dependent 
children.” 
It is impossible in this limited paper to give an abstract of the discussions of even 
the more important questions. It is gratifying to say that the discussions showeda 
general progress throughout the world in prison reform and in the prevention of 
crime. Especial testimony in this respect came from Japan, America, Germany, 
Sweden, France, Great Britain, and Russia. An interesting paper was read in the 
general assembly showing the advance in prison construction and management and 
the perfection reached in Japan. 5 
In Europe there is yet much imprisonment in common, but the general sentiment 
of the congress favored cellular separation. The new prisons of Europe are cellular, 
but mainly on the Pennsylvania system. The principle of conditional liberty was 
generally approved. The sentiment of the congress on the various questions can be 
found in the conclusions. Where there was great difference, the divisions submitted 
questions to a special commission which reported to the section and was then adopted. 
The difference in views at times was quite marked. Many of these questions related 
to matters more European than American, owing to the difference in conditions. 
But mainly they were of universal import. Charity for the feeble, education and 
not imprisonment for children, placing dependent and delinquent children in homes, 
separate and humane imprisonment for women, seeking ways to dry up the sources 
of crime, poverty, abandonment, occupied very much the thoughts and discussions, 
Pardon, reprimand, and suspension for the first offense, labor, rewards, patronage, 
visits, and means to prevent the squandering of earnings were very much discussed.
-P-A-G-E-770
694 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
There was much appeal to private initiative, the guardianship of earnings, libraries 
for prisons, alcoholism, disposition of mendicants, ete. Indemnity to the injured 
party, the forfeiture of parental rights, the identification of prisoners were also quite 
fully discussed. In the brief time given each question the discussions were often 
hurried, and being in four divisions, when congress came into general sessions many 
who did not hear tho first debates were unprepared. Under these circumstances it 
is remarkable that conclusions were reached in such good form and with such sub- 
stantial unanimity. This was effected largely by the ability of the chairmen of 
the sections and their accomplished secretaries, as well as by others in the general 
assembly. 
As a whole, the ten days’ work of specialists coming from twenty-six different 
countries with varied ideas and customs, the conclusions of the congress are remark- 
able for the unanimity of sentiment in their adoption, for their maturity of thought, 
scientific correctness, and conservatism. The proceedings, when published in full, 
will be a highly valuable addition to the literature of penology. It is only to be 
regretted that they will not appear in the English language. The Fifth Interna- 
tional Congress has done well, and we shall expect as much from the sixth in 1900 in 
Belgium. 
THE CLOSING WORDS. 
M. Duflos, the able chief of the French prison administration and first president 
of the congress, presided at the last session, and in declaring the close of the fifth 
congress spoke as follow: 
* “TLapIES AND GENTLE. : We have reached the close of our labors. Within ten 
days very much has been accomplished. Thirty questions were comprised in our 
programme. Allhave been studied with great care. They have given rise to learned 
and most profound discussions, not only in the sections, but also in the general 
assembly. The result is truly remarkable. Notwithstanding tho visits to institu- 
tions and excursions organized for our foreign colleagues; session, wo the art 
  attractions of Paris, which took away many at times from our sessions, we have had 
the high satisfaction to show an assiduity and tenacity for w: 
and satisfactory. 
“These results, I affirm, have exceeded our hopes. No programme so extensive 
has ever been submitted to a congress. We may regret without decreasing our zeal 
that some of these questions should be referred to the Sixth International Congress. 
Theso regrets your ardor, your ability, and the clearness of the thoughts presented 
have reduced toa minimum. We have a right to be proud of such results, to rejoice 
greatly, not only because we know we have done our duty, but above all because the 
example given here proves the vitality and efficiency of the congress; because this 
example is the shining confirmation of your power for good, for progress, for reform, 
justice, and peace; because, after the achievement of such work, the success of the next 
congress can not be doubted. You have proved yourselves gold and that nothing is 
impossible with men whom the love of science animates, to whom faith gives strength 
which overcomes obstacles with the light which radiates, warms, and vivifies. 
“In the meantime we must separate, after ten days devoted to labor in sessions 
during which an admirable exchange of ideas has taken place, with leisure moments 
for social conference, to revive old friendships and form new ties, and giving the 
gratifying spectacle of seeing men belonging to twenty-five different nations march- 
ing hand in hand, united by the same thoughts, lighted by the same flame, defending 
with ardor, with vivacity, different opinions, but having only one object. 
“Tt is not without heaviness of heart that I see you about toleave us. We hope 
that you will carry with you a lasting memory of your sojourn here; that you go 
with the conviction that you leave in Paris sincere and devoted friends. At times 
turn your eyes toward us, listen in the direction of France and you will hear the 
beatings of our hearts; you will see across the space our arms extended to you as 
though you said, ‘Friends, depend on us, believe in our unchangeable friendship ; we rk most commendable 
   
-P-A-G-E-771
    THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL PRISON CONGRESS. 695 
will soon be together again to attempt again our generous efforts. Our thoughts do 
not leaye you. The ties which bind us are those which can not break nor loosen.’ 
“No, ladies and gentlemen, this is not an adieu that we utter now. The Belgian 
Government, by its eminent and sympathetic representative, M. de Latour, has 
informed the International Penitentiary Commission that it tenders its hospitality in 
1900 to the Sixth International Prison Congress. The international commission has 
replied gratefully to this friendly and gracious appeal. This manifestation was 
acceptable to all the nations represented in the commission. I raised my hand with 
all my colleagues, regretting, as a Frenchman, that I could not vote twice for the 
proposition. Brussels is not too far from Paris, and we hope that the congress of 
Brussels will be an occasion for our foreign friends to come to Paris to assist in the 
festivals of labor, industry, commerce, and the arts that the Government of the 
French Republic prepares for the close of the century. 
“Au revoir, then, ladies and gentlemen. We offer for your country, your families, 
for all that is dear to you, our most sincere and affectionate wishes.” 
    CONCLUSIONS OF THE CONGRESS. 
SECTION I.—PENAL LEGISLATION. 
Question 1. 
1. Recidivism may be, according to the gravity of the case, general, special, or 
subordinate to the condition of the times. 
2. Its repression should be combined: 
a With the progressive increase of penalties, except 
vIn the infliction of a more severe penalty for professional criminals. 
8. The courts can not prejudice the first of these rules, because it recognizes the 
existence of exceptional extenuating circumstances, by an express decision. There 
should be fixed by law a special minimum to avoid the abuse of short sentences. 
4, In the second case the law should fix the number of convictions from which the 
courts could decide, according to the nature of the convictions and the degree of 
perversity, whether the offender is a criminal by profession. 
  Question 2. 
Transportation, under its various forms, with the improvements already realized 
and those of which it is susceptible, has its utility, either for the execution of long 
punishments for great crimes or for the repression of habitual criminals and obsti- 
nate recidivists. 
Question 3, 
1. It is desirable that the incapacity which affects an individual by reason of sen- 
tence pronounced against him for crime or misdemeanor at common law should follow 
him with legal effect into all countrie: 
2. It is desirable that the native convicted of crime or misdemeanor at common 
law abroad should be liable in his own country to the same forfeitures, incapacity, 
and prohibition as he would if convicted there. In the present state of international 
law the congress does not request that the forfeitures, incapacity, and prohibitions 
be the direct result of the foreign sentence, but that it be pronounced in consequence 
of a special act by the court of the country of the delinquent. 
3. The judge may consider, in fixing the penalty, convictions pronounced abroad, 
when the new violation has been committed on the territory of the delinquent. 
  Question 4. 
1. Penal legislation should consider more than it has formerly the necessity of 
securing redress for the injured party.
-P-A-G-E-772
  696 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
2. When the complaint of the plaintiff in the civil action for indemnity shall be 
established, he can not be required to pay costs. The plaintiff who has only joined 
his action to that brought by the public minister could, even if it fails, be only 
adjudged to pay the costs arising from his intervention. 
3. The aid of the court could be extended to the injured party before the proceed- 
ings on the part of the public. 
4, The public minister, in case of correctional or criminal prosecutions, will be held 
to submit without expense to the court the request for redress for the injured party, 
saving the right of the public minister to take, upon the admission or rejection of 
the request, such conclusions as may appear to him to be correct. 
5. The indemnity to the party injured will be secured by a general lien on the per- 
sonal and real estate of the person convicted, and this lien will be concurrent with 
that of the public treasury for the expenses of the prosecution. 
6. Congress decides that it takes into very serious consideration the propositions 
which have been submitted in reference to allowing the party injured a portion of 
the earnings received by the convict during his imprisonment, or to constitute a 
special fund of fines out of which aid shall be accorded to the party injured; but 
estimating that the cougress does not have sufficient data for the present solution of 
these questions, it decides to postpone the more profound’ study of the same to the 
next international congress. 
Question 5. 
1. The dual is a scientific and rational division. 
2. It is not proposed to request the States which have adopted it to abandon it. 
3. Butit may be useful to establish a correlative between the classifications of viola- 
tions and jurisdiction. To arrive at this correlation it is necessary to subdivide the 
first class of violations under the names of minor misdemeanors, major misdemean- 
ors, and crimes and misdemeanors. This tripartite division has a practical character 
which justifies its maintenance. 
Question 6. 
1. In penal cases the application of admonition by the judge and the suspension 
of sentence lead to identical results, and consequently it is useless to add the system 
of admonition to that of suspension of sentence. 
2. Legislation which recognizes in the courts the authority to suspend sentence 
for first offenses in cases of short convictions contains the best known provisions. 
SECTION II.—PENITENTIARY QUESTIONS. 
Question 1. 
It would be of great value to reach a prompt international arrangement relative 
to the unification of anthropometric proceedings. 
Question 2. 
1. It is right and necessary to provide in the regulations different prison arrange- 
ments for women and men, as much in a physical as in a moral and intellectual point 
of view. 
2. It is necessary to provide in the regulations arrangements mitigating the dis- 
ciplinary régime and ameliorating the diet regimen for women. 
3. It is necessary to institute special establishments or special quarters for mothers. 
Question 3. 
Manual labor should, as a general regulation, be made obligatory for all punish- 
ments by imprisonment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-773
  THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL PRISON CONGRESS. 697 
Question 4. 
The prisoner has no right to compensation for labor. It is for the interest of the 
State to reward the prisoner for such labor. 
Question 5. 
Without discussing prison systems in this respect, the congress considers that it is 
not desirable that compensation to prisoners be very freely extended, 
Question 6. 
1. A regulation posted in a prison should provide for the principal violations and 
indicate the different penalties. 
2. The punishment should be pronounced after a thorough examination and after 
haying heard the prisoner. 
3. The sentence should state how long the punishment is to continue. 
Question 7. 
In the interest of general discipline and reformation, at first the selection should 
be made from the worst. 
Question 8. 
1, In estimating the duration of punishment for the criminal insane there should 
be estimated the time during which 
(a) They are confined in special asylums of the prison administration ; 
(b) They are transferred to insane asylums, properly called. 
2. If legislation accords a reduction of the time of imprisonment fixed by the sen- 
tence, on condition that the time be passed in a cell, the congress is of the opinion 
that the criminal insane should continue to have the benefit of this advantage, even 
though, during his insanity, he will have been remitted to the regimen in common, 
Question 9. 
Labor and not gymnastics should maintain the ability of prisoners to work. 
  
SECTION IUI.—PREVENTIVE MEASURES. 
Question 1. 
1. It is desirable that the prisoner, on his discharge, should not have the free dis- 
posal of his earnings. 
2. Congress expresses the view that the earnings of the discharged prisoner should 
be confided each time as its importance, the morality of the discharged, or other 
circumstances justify, either to a savings bank or an official of the place where he 
locates, or to a patronage society offering all the necessary guaranties, or to persons 
approved by the administration, to be paid to him after his presumed wants are 
known. 
8. Congress is of opinion that preference should be given to patronage societies. 
     
Question 2. 
1. Schools should be organized, to serve equally the prisoner awaiting trial, the 
convicted illiterate, and those who already possess limited education. ‘This school 
should not only procure them the knowledge they need, but should also furnish a 
moral training, which, without wounding the denominational belief of any prisoner, 
should be imbued with religious spirit—the indispensable element of reformation. 
2. The libraries, having equally for their principal object the instruction and refor- 
mation of the prisoner, should be organized in the same spirit. They should contain,   
   
-P-A-G-E-774
    698 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
besides divers religious and moral works, interesting works—books of travel, respect- 
able stories, illustrated publications, such as pictorial magazines, ete. It is for 
the administration to establish the libraries. At the same time, tho assistance of 
individuals or associations can be accepted, especially to procure for foreign 
convicts books written in their language. For the latter purpose the exchange of 
books and other publications may be recommended between other countries and the 
administration. 
3. It is proper to put in the hands of prisoners a special weekly publication, which 
shall be edited by the administration. 
       
   
     
    
        
    
                 
     
   
   
    Question 8. 
1. Asylums or special quarters should be provided for the confinement of the 
insane, in accordance with the order of the court, who have been prosecuted and 
acquitted by reason of their mental condition. 
2. The discharge of the insane from the asylum should be autho 
the administration, and the physician of the institution.      ed by the court, 
Question 4, 
1. Society has the right to take steps for its preservation, even coercive, against 
beggars and vagabonds. With this right it has the duty to organize, in a reason- 
able way, public charity, private aid, and patronage. 
2. Vagabonds and beggars should be treated according to the circumstances, 
whether 
(a) Diseased or infirm paupers; ; 
(b) Beggars or accidental vagabonds; 
(c) Beggars or professional yagabonds. 
The first should be aided if unable to earn their living. The second, relieved by 
public or private charity, should be placed in refuges or charity stations, well 
organized, where work shall be obligatory. The third should be the object of severe 
repression and of a nature to prevent recidivation. 
3. The most efficient measure against these professionals is prolonged imprison- 
ment, in virtue of the order of the court, in special workhouses. Tho prisoners 
should be liberated in consequence of their reformation or if, on reclassification, their 
detention appears to be no longer necessary. Labor in the workhouses should 
be supervised, not only as a means of repression, but, above all, to assist in reclass- 
ification. 
      Question 5. 
1. The congress, impressed with the increasing progress of alcoholism, of which 
the principal cause is in the consumption of nonrectified alcohols or artificially com- 
posed drinks, the influence of which manifests itself in the increase of crime, pre- 
sents the opinion that to combat this scourge public authority and private assoc 
tions should unite for preventive and therapeutic measures. 
2, Among tho preventive measures the congress recommends, on one side, the regu- 
lation of drink houses, the limitation of their number, the reduction of hygienic 
drinks, the rectification of alcohols; and on the other side, the organization and 
establishment of temperance leagues in institutions to influence the manners and 
habits of inmates. 
3. Ina therapeutic point of view each country should create inebriate asylums, in| 
which labor should be largely organized, their number to be regulated by the ine- 
-briate population in each section. 
4, The admission to inebriate asylums should be regulated by the legislature, 
whether the inebriate himself applies for treatment, or has been convicted for mis 
demeanors incited by intoxication, or because his habitual intoxication has become 
peril to himself and the safety of others. The discharge from such asylums shoul 
also be regulated by law.

SECTION IV.—QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO CHILDREN. 
     
                                                                             
   
    
   
   
     
   
    Question 1. 
It is proper to fix the limit of penal minority at the age of 18 years, on condition 
that children committed to a reformatory educational institution over 16 years of 
age shall not be placed with the younger children. 
Question 2. 
1. In cases where the courts have jurisdiction to declare the parental authority 
forfeited it should deprive the parents of their guardianship and substitute other 
guardianship in its stead. 
2. The civil jurisdiction is that of the common law to decide on questions affecting 
the guardianship of minors. But courts of repression trying cases showing the 
unworthiness of the parents have power to declare the parental right of guardian- 
ship forfeited. 
Questions 3 and 4, 
1. Children brought into court can, according to their age, the nature of the acts for 
which they have been arrested, and the extent of their discernment, be sent to estab- 
lishments, public or private, having either a charitable, preservative, or reformatory 
character. Children under 12 years should always be sent to houses of preservation. 
Children convicted should be sent to institutions or special quarters. 
2. It is desirable that the name given to these establishments be not of a-nature to 
prejudice the future of tho children. 
3. It belongs to the judical authority to decide whether the child shall be placed 
under administrative guardianship. The selection of the regimen, if there be any, 
and any alterations in it belong to the authority charged with the education of the 
child, 
4, The response to the question of recidivism was referred to the first section of 
the congress. That in reference to the conditional liberation of minors was referred 
to the second section. 
5. A conditional discharge should be granted in all cases where the child shall- 
have received a school and professional cducation sufficient, in the opinion of the 
administration, and provided that it be shown that the child will be under contin- 
ued supervision, that it will be assured of work, and that it will be provided with 
all material and moral needs. 
6. To prevent children from becoming vagabonds or beggars, it is necessary (1) 
to deprive unworthy parents of the right to bring them up and to punish promoters 
of mendicity; (2) to aid respectable but incompetent parents in supervising their 
children sufficiently to fulfill their mission, (a) in the strict application of the school 
laws, (b) in instituting créches, asylums, or maternal schools; (3) to offer to orphan 
or abandoned youth the means to avoid vagabondage and mendicity in receiving 
them into special temporary work asylums without treating them as delinquents, 
vagabonds, or voluntary beggars. 
7. If it is demonstrated that the condition of the vagabond or mendicant child is 
attributable to the fault or negligence of those who have authority over him, they 
should be prosecuted and imprisoned, with fine and the remoyal of their civil rights, 
or with one of these penalties only, but without prejudice to parental authority or 
removal of the guardianship. 
8. In this case, and after the organization of preventive measures, the parents 
guilty of not having watched over the child can be declared, in whole or in part, 
responsible for the expenses of guardianship and the education of the minors, 
9. Lodging houses and publie houses which give in a permanent or temporary 
manner asylum to minors for the purposes of debauchery should be condemned to 
correctional punishment. For the second offense the closing of the establishment 
hhould be ordered by the court; and this should be obligatory in case of recidivists, 
   
-P-A-G-E-776
  700 “EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Question 5. 
The leading feature of a rational physical education should be professional work, 
and especially agricultural labor outdoors, for both sexes. 
Question 6, 
1. When the child has been placed at the disposal of the State, or when adminis- 
trative guardianship has been ordered, such guardianship should be during minority. 
2. In all eases where a minor has been convicted he should be placed under admin- 
istrative guardianship until his civil majority. 
3. In both cases a decision of the court could terminate this guardianship when 
the authorties have ascertained that the education of the child is completed. 
Question 7. 
Children placed under administrative guardianship, or placed under the control of 
the State, can only be efficiently supervised by patronage societies. 
Question 8. 
1. The enticing away by solicitation or fraud for prostitution, the employment of 
the same means to compel a woman even of age to surrender herself to prostitution, 
should be severely repressed with increase of penalty in case of recidivists. 
2. There should be requested a conference of delegates of Governments to take 
international measures against white slavery. 
8. The best methods to suppress the prostitution of minors are— 
(a) To raise the age of consent to 15 years. 
(0) To increase the number of reform schools, asylums, refuges, or other establish- 
ments of the same kind for female minors who have become immoral. 
4, Recognizing the influence of religious education on public morality, it is neces- 
sary to respect the important réle in which it has always been held. 
5. Every minor of both sexes less than 18 years of age found in a habitual state 
of prostitution shall be taken, after instruction or inquiry, before the court, which, 
according to the circumstances, will order its return to its parents or its committal 
until majority to a correctional institution, educational or reformatory, or to such 
respectable family as shall be designated. 
6. The congress is of the opinion that the question of regulating prostitution 
should be submitted to the next congress. 
7. The congress expresses the opinion that with the least delay possible there 
should be established between the different States, and more especially in the frontier 
Tegions of frontier States, international patronage relations for young discharged 
prisoners and abandoned children. 
8. This international patronage should be not only to aid the young and super- 
vised children, but above all to watch over and promptly direct them to their own 
country and to place them with patronage societies there.

    CHAPTER XIV. 
THE LETTERS OF RABBI AKIBAH, OR THE JEWISH PRIMER 
AS IT WAS USED IN THE PUBLIO SCHOOLS TWO THOU- 
SAND YEARS AGO! 
PREFACE BY THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
This article is interesting and valuable in the history of education as showing the 
pains taken in Hebrew education to find a spiritual sense to all natural and artificial 
objects. Europeans and Americans are content to require their children to study 
the alphabet and master it as a. mechanical affair. The Hebrew is of all peoples the 
one chosen by Divine Providence to ponder most carefully the spiritual sense of 
nature and human life. It would be expected, therefore, that an account of Hebrew 
education would show some of the devices by which the directive power of that 
wonderful people should manifest its sleepless care over the culture of the spiritual 
sense. 
The lesson of the history of education of all peoples is this demonstration of the 
constant alertness, so to speak, of the national spirit in looking to its own preser- 
vation. The Chinese lay immense stress upon the mere verbal memory, teaching 
the etiquette laid down in the books of Confucius and Mencius. The child has all 
of his habits of thought trained in the direction of the observance of family eti- 
quette. He learns to respect and obey his elder brother, his father and mother, and 
the officers of the State. He learns to protect those who depend in like manner 
upon him. This comes out in every phase of Chinese education. The culture peoples 
that have contributed to our civilization, the Greeks, the Romans, and the Jews, 
furnished still stronger illustrations of this principle. The Greeks contributed 
science and «esthetic art to modern civilization. The entire culture of the Greek 
people, at least of the Athenian people, has this significance. So, too, the Romans, 
who contributed to the world its sense of legal right, the protection of life and prop- 
erty. All that we learn about the Romans goes to give us an insight into the care 
which the spirit of the Roman people took to preserve in its education this insight 
into the human will, both the individual and the social will. 
The student of the philosophy of history and the philosophy of education will 
read with interest this excerpt from the history of the Jewish education, as showing 
the neglect of what is mechanical and prosaic; what, in other words, is the letter 
for the spirit of it—the spiritual sense which the Hebrew mind finds underlying 
all objects in time and space. 
HISTORY AND NATURE OF THE PRIMER. 
When I was engaged in writing the first part of my treatise on Hebrew education 
I discovered an ancient Jewish text-book, which was written for the public schools 
by the great educator Rabbi Akibah, who lived at the time of the second destruc- 
tion. WhenI mentioned my discovery to the well-known scholar Hon. Judge Mayer 
  
} Discovered and translated for the first time by Prof. Naphtali Herz Imber, 1896. 
701   
    
 
-P-A-G-E-778
  702 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Sulzberger, cf Philadelphia, he encouraged me to examine the booklet more carefully. 
A careful investigation followed, and I found it to bean ancient Jewish primer. The 
booklet contains about sixty small printed pages, written in fine classic Hebrew. 
Its antiquity issoon recognized by its spiritual tendency. The composition is made 
on the same principle as that of the Alpha Bethical picture book of the ancient 
Jewish primary school, namely: It is built on the letters of the Hebrew Alpha Beth. 
While the letters of the Alpha Beth were explained to the children, the meanings of 
their figures, shapes, and positions, this Jewish primer endeavors to explain the let- 
ters and meanings of the terms. 
The tablets inthe primary school correspond more to our modern picture books, 
while the Jewish primer has the character and poetical touch of modern readers. 
The booklet is divided into three parts; the first is of a lighter matter than the second, 
and the second than the third. It is probable that the first part was made for the 
first school standard, while the second and third portions were calculated for the 
higher classes. The third part assumes the character of theological commentaries. In 
general, it breathes a deep religious, poetical, spiritual tone, and we can pow under- 
derstand the psychological problem how the Hebrews, whose religion was void of 
the idealistic charm which characterized the religion of the Pagans, yet proved 
to be better devotees to their faith in spite of its dryness and lack of inspiring 
motives. The answer to that problem is the Jewish primer, and the idealistic 
spiritual education which was implanted in the heart of the child by it, and has 
inspired later the grown Hebrew to endure temptations, as well as persecution. 
From a historical and educational point of view the Jewish primer is of great value, 
ing testimonies to the great power of education. 
      THE TRANSLATION. 
First Parr. 
Said Rabbi Akibah, those are the twenty-two letters, by and through which the 
“Torah” (the law) was given to all the tribes of Israel. They are engraved by a 
fairy pen upon the most exalted crown of the Holy One; praise to Him. When the 
will of the Holy One was to create the universe, those letters arrayed themselves 
before the Lord, each desiring to be made the medium of the creative force. First 
appeared the Taw, the last of the letters in the Alpha Beth, and begged that the 
Lord would create the world with it, pleading ‘“‘O Lord, create through me the 
world as I am the first letter of the Torah (the law).” The Lord then replied, ‘‘No.” 
Then the Taw asked why, and the Lord answered, ‘‘ Because I will put thee as a sign 
of destruction upon the foreheads of the wicked.” Tay means a sign in Hebrew as 
it is written in Ezekiel (xvi), and the Lord said unto me, ‘Pass through Jerusalem, 
and put a sign upon the foreheads of the groaning and moaning people for the 
iniquities they did.” What is the meaning of the sign? When the Almighty 
resolved to destroy Jerusalem He called to the Angel of Death, saying unto him, 
“Go through Jerusalem and divide the wicked and the good ones. Upon the former 
make a Taw of blood, a sign of death, while upon the latter sign a Taw of ink, the 
symbol of life.” Why is the shape of the Taw peculiar from all the letters? 
Because the Torah saves man from all troubles. At that time the Spirit of Justice 
appeared before the Lord, urging tho destruction of the good ones too. The Lord 
asked why, and the Spirit of Justice replied, ‘‘ Because they did not warn the 
wicked.” The Lord replied, “It is known to me that those wicked would not heed 
their warnings.” Then the Spirit of Justice said that it was their duty to warn 
regardless of the consequences. ‘The Lord then declared that they should share the 
same fate as the wicked. 
At that time six destructive angels were sent upon Jerusalem to destroy her people, 
as it is written (Ezekiel ix), ‘‘ Behold, six men were coming from the upper gate, 
facing the north side, each armed, and the man dressed in linen stood among them,   
   
-P-A-G-E-779
  AN ANCIENT JEWISH PRIMER. 703 
and the pen of a writer on his loins, and he went near the copper altar.” Why the 
north side? Because all ill winds are blowing only from the north side, as it is 
written (Jeremiah i) ‘‘And he said unto me, from the north the ill fate will come 
upon the dwellers of the land.” As soon as the Taw heard it from the mouth of the 
Most High the latter left the place sorrowful. 
Then appeared before the Lord the letter Shin, the next to the last of the letters, 
praying the Lord to create with it the world, under the plea that the letter Shin is 
the first letter in the Holy Name of Shadi (the Almighty). Then the Lord refused 
to accept on the ground that Shin is the first letter of falsehood, ‘‘Sheker.” ‘And 
how,” said the Lord, ‘‘can I create the world with a letter which has no foot? and 
falsehood has no footing.” The Shin went out sorrowful, and the letter Reish 
appeared before the Lord with the same wish, saying, “I am the first letter of Thy 
name, the Merciful and the Healer.” But the Lord said ‘‘No, as Reish is the first 
letter of Rashu, which means wicked.” So the Reish left sorrowful, and the K 
* appeared before the Lord, asking that the world may be created with it, as the 
people will praise the Lord with that letter in saying thrice Holy, Holy, Holy, is 
the Lord Zebaath (Kadosh means holy). The Lord refused on the ground that 
curse is prepared to come over the generations of the flood, and in Hebrew curse is 
“Kellala.” The K went out sorrowful, and the Zadic or Z appeared before the Lord 
with the same wish as the former letters, saying, ‘Create with me the world, as Thou 
art called Zadic” (Righteous One). The Lord refused and said ‘No, as many 
troubles are to come with thee upon Israel” (Zara is trouble in Hebrew). The Z 
went out sorrowful, and the P came before the Lord, saying, ‘‘Create with me the 
world, as the laws will be called Pikiddim, and I am the first letter in Thy name 
as Redeemer” (Pode is redeemer in Hebrew), The Lord replied “No, as they will 
serye the idols with thee” (Peor is the famous namo of a famousidol). The P went 
out sorrowful, and the E or Ain came before the Lord, saying, ‘‘Create with me the 
world, as it is written (Zachazje) the eyes of the Lord are upon the whole universe” 
(Ain is eye in Hebrew). The Lord replied “No, as with thee the people watch the 
night, to commit crime and sin, as it is written (Job xxiv) ‘the eye of the adulterer 
watches the night, and I will punish the wicked by thee,’ as it is written (Job xi) 
‘the eyes of the wicked will go out.’” The E went out sorrowful, and the § or Samech 
came before the Lord, saying, ‘‘Create with me the world, as through me Thou art 
called the leaner of the fallen ones” (Samech is leaning). The Lord said ‘No, as 
with thee the pagans will destroy my city, as it is written (Psalms) ‘they made 
Jerusalem the ruins of piles.’” The S went out, and the N or Nun came before the 
Lord, saying, ‘‘ Create with me the world, as with me Thou willst resurrect the dead, 
and I am called the candle of the Lord, which is the soul in man” (Proverbs xx). 
(‘‘Ner” is candle.) The Lord answered ‘‘No, as I will blow out the light of the 
wicked in the latter days to come.” The N went out sorrowful, and the M or Mim 
came before the Lord saying, ‘‘ Create with me the world, as with me the genera- 
tions to come will crown Thee proclaiming Thy Heavenly, Eternal Kingdom, and 
with me’ Thou art called King (Melech).” The Lord said ‘‘No, as with thee will 
come a day of compassion.” The M went out sorrowful, and the L or Lamed came 
before the Lord, saying, ‘‘ Create with me the world, as with me Thou wilt once give 
to Israel the two tablestones, and Israel will learn Thy laws.” (Lamed means 
study.) The Lord said “No, as the tablestones will be broken.” The L went out 
sorrowful, and the Caf came before the Lord. At that hour, when the Caf went 
down from the Crown divine (Keter is crown), a storm arose in the celestial realm, 
When the Caf appeared before the glorious throne, the throne began to be shaken, 
and the wheels of the glorious chariot began to tremble. The Lord inquired for 
their uneasiness, and they said, ‘‘ For the Caf went down from the exalted glorious 
crown of our heads and stays before Thee, and all our glory is only called by the 
Caf, as it is written (Jeremiah xvii), ‘Exalted glorious throne, the glory of God is 
forever.’” So the Lord called to the Caf, saying, ‘‘ What is thy wish?” The Caf 
   
-P-A-G-E-780
    704 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
said, ‘‘O Lord of the universe, create with me the world, as with me is named Thy 
Throne, Thy Glory, and Thy Crown.” He answered “No, as by thee I will once 
elutch with my hands for grief, as it is written (Ezekiel xxi) ‘I will too clutch my 
hands (Caf is hand); with thee will also_go out the tears of my people and I shall 
create with thee the world.’” The C went out sorrowful, and the Jod came before 
the Lord, saying, ‘‘O Lord, create with me the world, as with me Thou art named 
Jathe Creator of the Worlds” (Isaiah xxvi). The Lord said, ‘‘No, as with thee I will 
create the wicked thought in man to Jure him away from the good path.” The Jod 
went out sorrowful, and the T or Teth came before the Lord, saying, ‘‘O Lord, create 
with me the world, as with me Thou willst send the Holy Ghost to those who fear 
Thee, and in me is hidden the good one” (Tob is good). The Lord said ‘‘No, as with 
thee I will once call my people ‘unclean,’ ‘Tame,’ and every leper will be so called.” 
The T went out sorrowful, and the Ch or Cheth came before the Lord, saying, ‘‘O 
Lord, create with me the world, as with me they feel Thy mercy feeling the whole uni- 
verse, and with me Thou art called merciful.” The Lord said ‘‘No, as with thee I once 
willengrave with an iron pen thesin of Judah.” The Ch went out sorrowful, and the 
S or Sain came before the Lord, saying, ‘‘O Lord, create with me the world, as Thy 
reverence from generation to generation exists with me.” The Lord said “No, asadul- 
tery will come upon the world through thee, and as a consequence Israel will lose 
twenty-four thousand people, and how can I create the world with thee?” The § 
went out sorrowful, and the W or Waw came before the Lord, saying, ‘‘O Lord, 
create with me the world, as with me they praiso Thee, Thou Holy One in Israel.” The 
Lord said, ‘No, as I once will inflict upon Israel for their passions.” The W went 
out sorrowful, and the H or He came before the Lord, saying, ‘‘O Lord, create 
with me the world, as with me they acknowledge Thy majesty and glory.” The 
Lord answered, ‘‘ No, as with thee I will once in the later days of judgment make the 
day that of penance, burning all the wicked and evil doers.” The H went out sor- 
rowful, and the D or Dalith came before the Lord, saying, ‘‘O Lord, create with 
me the world, as with me the generations will exalt Thee, as it is written (Psalms 
exlviii) ‘Generation to generation will praise Thy work.’” The Lord answered, “No, 
as with thee Israel will experience judgment among themselves, as it is written in 
the Scripture.” The D went out sorrowful, and the Gor Gimel came before the 
Lord, saying, ‘‘O Lord, create with me the world, as with me the people praise 
Thy greatness.” The Lord answered ‘No, as with thee I will pay to the enemies, 
as it is written (Isaiah lix) ‘as to the reward He will pay.’” The G went out sor- 
rowful, and the B or Beth came before the Lord, saying, ‘‘O Lord, create with me 
the world, as with me all the creation praises Thy glorious name, as it is written 
(Psalms Ixxxix), ‘ Blessed be the Lord forever; Amen. Praise the Lord all His hosts. 
All the coming generations will say, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel and Blessed be 
the glorious name forever’” (Psalms lxxvi). The B is the first letter in Hebrew for 
blessed. As soon as the Lord heard the plea of the B he accepted, and created the 
world with the letter B as it is written in Genesis. ‘‘ Breishith Bara Elohim,” which 
means with B created the Lord heaven and earth. As the A or the Aleph heard and 
saw how the Lord had accepted the letter B it went aside meditating in silence. 
Then the Lord said unto the A, ‘‘ Why art thou silent?” and the A replied, ‘‘ Because 
Ido not count for much, as I represent only number one, while the other letters 
represent much, as B, number two, C, three, D, four, and so on.” Then the Lord said, 
“Be not afraid, as thou art the king over all the letters; thou art one, and I am one, 
and the law is one, and with thee I will give it to Israel, my people, who are called 
one (nation), as the first letter of the Ten Commandments is the A or Aleph in the 
word ‘ Anochi’ ‘I am thy Lord.’”? 
       
1 The pleadings of the letters in every sentence they mention is that each letter begins the respective 
Biblical passage. The way of its composition shows the childish spirit, yet in that most fantastic 
tale is hidden one thought of the most prevalent philosophy of that age—the Logos idea.

Why is the head of the A or Aleph upright standing on two legs as men? Because 
it is second in Truth (A is the first letter of Emeth, truth) and falsehood has no legs 
to stand upon, since all the letters of falsehood have no foothold. Why is his hand 
stretched out from his side? Because he shows to the Almighty, who is Truth Him- 
self, as itis written (Psalm cxvi) ‘‘and the Truth of the Lord forever.” 
Why is the B or Beth with its open face toward the G? Because the B resembles 
a house (Beth is house in Hebrew) open to all, and the G resembles a man who 
sees a poor one at the door, and goes into the house to bring out some food. 
Why is the foot of the G or Gimel toward the D? Because all merey must be 
‘extended to the poor. (Dal is poor in Hebrew.) 
Why is the D or Dalith resembling a stick and facing the H? Because the poor 
man is striving only for the bliss of the material world. 
Why is the H or Hei resembling an open hut? Because he who wants to get 
outofitcandoso. Why has it two doors, onesmall and one large? Because he who 
wants to get out goes out through the larger, and he who wants to get in must come 
in through the smaller. (Allegory for birth and death.) 
Why is the W or Waw upright like a stick facing the S? Because God has hinted 
through the symbols of the letters that He will once punish the wicked by messen- 
gers with fire sticks of the purgatory, from where their woe cry will be heard, as it 
is written (Isaiah iii) ‘‘ Woe to the wicked.” 
Why has the § or Sain two points on its head, one toward the Waw and the other 
the Cheth? Because if one goes to sin, he looks twice, once to be hidden from men, 
_ the other look is directed toward the crime. 
Why has the Ch or Chet no crown? Because the wicked have only shame, and 
they are void of good name. (Chet means sin.) 
Why is the hand of the T or Teth hidden inside and its head upright with a crown 
on? Because he who does good and helps the poor that nobody sees will calm 
the wrath even that of the Angel of Death, as it is written (Proverbs xxi) “A hidden 
gift calms the wrath.” 
Why is the Jod smaller than all the letters? Because he who humbles himself 
here will inherit the life hereafter, which was created with that letter. Why is the 
point of it toward its face? Because each one gets rewarded according to his merit, 
and his good deeds are before him. 
Why resembles the Caf a throne and facing the L? Because a throne is fit only 
for the kings to sit on. (Kese is throne, and Melech is king.) 
Why is the L or Lamed taller than all the letters? Because it stands in the center 
of the twenty-two letters, and resembles a king, a throne behind and kingdom 
before him. 
Why is there an open M and a close M? (The former is used in the middle of 
the word as well as at the beginning, while the latter only at the end.) Because 
there is an open king and there is a close king. Why is the head of the open M 
toward the ground with the hand stretched on high? Because it points out to Him, 
to whom all kingdom belongs, as it is written (Psalm xxii) ‘‘To Thee, O Lord, is the 
Kingdom,” and at the same time looks to the ground to show, as King David said, 
“From Thee is all.” The closed M points out that all is closed to us, 
Why is the N or Nun facing the S or Samech? Because it looks as one who falls 
and prays to be leaned. 
Why is the S or Samech closed around? Because it is a symbol to Israel, who is 
closed round on all the corners with divine glory, and that He will not exchange him 
for another nation, and his seed will not be mixed with the seed of others, as it is 
written ‘‘The Lord belongs to His people.” Also it is written (Zechariah) “I, the 
Lord, will surround thee with a fire wall.” 
The E or Ain is the initial of Esau the wicked, from whom Persians and Tarsians

eaine forth. Why is the E ina sitting position? Because they will fall before the 
feet of Israel, as it is written (Obadja i) ‘‘The house of Jacob will be fire and Edom 
will be his inheritance.” 
Why is there a sitting and a standing P? (The standing P is only used at the end 
of a word.) Because the mouth which opens thesame seals. (P means mouth.) Tho 
idol worshipers have no open mouth in the Jaws and in the oral law or in prayers; 
only Israel alone, as it is written (Psalms exlvii) ‘He told His words to Jacob. He 
did not so to any nation.” 
Why has the Z or Zadic two heads? Because there are two kinds of righteous 
people; the one plain and the other with humility. 
Why is the K or Kaf tall and horned? Because all the horns of the wicked will be 
cut off, for they walk proudly in this life. As it is written (Psalm Ixxviii) ‘And all 
the horns of the wicked I will cut off.” He will again exalt those of Israel, as it 
is written (Psalm lxxy) ‘‘Exalted will be the horns of the pious ones.” 
Why is the face of the R or Reish turned away from the K? Because Ri 
tial of the wicked, and K the initial of the holy, and the wicked is alway 
away from tho holy. 
Why has the Sch or Shin three branches aboye and no foot or root below? Because 
the Shin is the initial of falsehood, and falsehood has no foothold and the Almighty 
will stop the mouth of falsehood. It resembles a tree whose branches are plentiful 
and the roots little; the wind can easily turn it over. 
Why is the foot of the Taw a little broken up? Because Taw is the initial of the 
Torah, the law, and he who wants to study the law must humble and lower himself. 
    the ini- 
turning 
  ANOTHER EXPLANATION FOR THE ALPHA BETH, 
  Aleph Beth means, learn wisdom. (Aleph means learn; Beth is like Bina wi 
_ dom, and on that line the whole Alpha Beth is explained according to the meanings 
of their terms.) 
Gimmel Dalith means, be merciful to the poor. Why is the leg of the Gimel 
stretched forward? Because the good ones are apt after the poor to help them. 
Why is the back of the Dalith turned toward the Gimel? Because the pocr looks 
behind him expecting somebody to help him. 
Why is the H'after D? Because he who helps the poor will become great. 
Why is the W afterH? Because of him who does not help the poor, they ‘Woe 
tothat man who can but will not do good with his wealth,” and it is written (Proverbs 
xi) “‘He who keeps away his wealth from charity, will lose it.” 
Why come after WS and S Ch? They show that if one have conquered his tem- 
per and done good, then he will find mercy at the throne of the Almighty. 
Why are the letters of truth scattered and the letters of falsehood together. (A 
is the initial of Emcth, truth; M is the second letter, and Taw is the last letter, 
while Sheker, falsehood, formed from the letters Sh, k, r, are following each other.) 
Because truth is very rare to find, while falsehood is behind the ear. As they taught 
in the College of Rabbi Ismael, he who wants to become impure, they open to him, 
but he who tries to be pure, they help him. 
Why are the five special letters of double character? (There are five letters in 
the Hebrew Alpha Beth which have double ones, and they are used at the end of the 
words; they are M,N, Z, P, Ch.) 
The simple Caf and the closed Caf show the simple hand of Moses and the closed 
hand of God. 
The open M and the closed M show that there is an open sentence (or word) and 
a hidden word, and from it must be learned the good manner; that the teacher shall 
speak and the pupil silent and listening. 
The bowed Z and the simple Z; the former represents the bowed pious one, the 
latter the simple one. Each sage must study and seek the truth of the law with

the utmost sincerity, as it is written (Psalm cxy) ‘‘ Hail to those who keep His law; 
with all their hearts they seek Him. 
  TuirpD Parr, 
“At” “Bash.” Aleph is Adam, who was the first creature of the world, as the 
creation was created by the word (logos), but he was created by the hand of the 
Almighty. How do I know that the world was created by the word? Then it is 
written (Psalm xxxiii), ‘‘He said, and it was;” in another line he says, ‘‘ By the word. 
of God the Heavens were made.” . 
How do I know that Adam was made by His hand? As it is written (Genesis) ‘‘ And 
the Lord created the man.” What is the meaning of the passsage (Psalm ¢: x) 
“And Thou puttest Thy hand upon me?” The Lord made first Adam so tall that 
his height was from the ground to the sky. When the angels saw him they began 
to tremble and appeared before the Lord saying, ‘“‘Are there two Lords; ene in 
Heaven and the other on earth?” What did God? He simply put his hand on him 
and shortened his height 2,000 cubits. 
Bash, B, is the initial of animals. Shin is the initial of reptiles, which -were 
created with Adam. Why have they been created with him? Because the Lord 
says, “If he gets proud, then we say to him, Behold, animals and reptiles were 
created as you, too.” 
Gar Dack (a combination of the letter G with R, and the letter D with K, and so 
goes on through the whole order of the Alpha Beth). Gar, Gimel; this represents 
the Garden of Eden, placing there twelve canopies of precious stones and of pearls 
for Adam, as it is written (Ezechiel xxv) ‘‘In Eden the Garden of the Lord thou 
wast; all the precious stones were thy shelter.” R means that he, Adam, went the 
first into Eden before all the pious ones. 
D,K. D means the doors of Eden, which angels opened to him, whom the Lord 
appointed as his servants. K means holy; these angels called him Adam, “holy.” 
H, Z. Has the Almighty lulled Adam into sleep. Z means the rib which He took 
from him to form from it his counterpart, his wife. 
W,F. W means that He bronght Eve to Adam, accompanied by tens of thousands 
of angels, who were singing and cheering. F means that the whole celestial family 
went down into Eden; some of them were playing on harps and the others play 
instruments, playing like virgins; while sun, moon, and stars were dancing before 
them as girls. 
S,E. S means that the Lord invited them both to a banquet in Eden. E means 
that the Lord prepared for them tables of pearl; each pearl was 2 cubits long and 60 
cubits broad, and all sorts of food were thereon, as it is written (Psalm xxiii) ‘‘Thou 
preparest a table for me.” 
Ch,$. Ch means that the angels did servant duty, roasting his meat and cooling 
his wine, and the serpent saw their honor-and envied them. §S means that the Lord 
told him not to eat from the tree of knowledge.    
      
11he second part was, judging from its character, probably taught in the next school standard 
caleulated for pupils from 8 to 10 years old. The second part does not contain the childish fantasy 
heated by the steam of oriental imagination. It simply explains the letters of the Alpha Beth in 
the line of their words and terms, while at the same time it tries to implant in the heart of the child 
religious, moral, and national patriotic sentiments. The third part is in quantity as well as quality 
far superior to the other two, for it has a homiletic character, and tries to mako the child acquainted 
with somo of the most truly national and religious traditions and legends. A new mode of explaining 
the letters is, that it takes the first letter of the Alpha Beth, combines with the last Taw and forms 
a new word “At,” which is explained by some folklore. 
‘Thon it takes the next letter B combining with the next last letter Sh or Shin and a word “Bash” 
is formed and explained. That way was for training the child’s brain to the scholastic way of argu- 
ment among the sages of the Rabbis of the Talmud. The gradual rising of the thought in the primer 
indicates the great educational principle which the author had before his eyes. The third part of the 
primer was for pupils of the age of 10 and upward; it was calculated to prepare them for the study 
of the Talmud and oral law.   
-P-A-G-E-784
  708 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
F,N. F means that Eve mistook the words of the serpent, and ate from the for- 
bidden fruit. N means that their eyes were opened to see that they were naked, 
and they covered their nakedness with fig leaves. 
Jod, M. Yod means that the Almighty was aware of it, and he went down to call 
Adam for it. M means that the Lord questioned him, ‘‘ Who told you that you were 
naked?” 
C,L. C means that the Lord invited them all for judgment. First, He called 
aside Adam, asking him why he ate from the fruit. Adam defended himself, saying 
that Eve gave him to eat. The woman was questioned, and she pleaded that she did 
it under the temptation of the serpent. The serpent was called and cursed. When 
the Lord said to the serpent ‘On thy belly thou shalt go,” the serpent begged, ““O 
Lord, make me as the fish in water, which have no feet,” and the Lord said, ‘‘ Dust 
shall be thy food.” Then the serpent said, “If the fish eat dust, I will eat it too.” 
At that moment the Lord tore his tongue in two parts, saying, ‘‘ Wicked one, thou 
hast sinned in gossip, since I make known to the world that it is on account of thy 
unruly tongue.” 
A, Ch, 8, means that God said unto the angels, I, myself, will be more merciful 
to Israel than to the idol worshipers, for the former crown me twice a day and pro- 
claim my kingdom morning and evening by their declarations, ‘‘ Hear, O Israel, the 
Lord our God is one.” If Israel would not exist, neither glory nor exaltation would 
exist. 
B, T, E (Bata). My spirit is only calmed by Israel, for the heathen make mis- 
takes to take sun, moon, and stars as deities. And when they bow before them and 
before the hosts of Heaven, then the Holy One is wrath, as it is written (Psalm vii), 
“God is wrath every day.” The Almighty says unto the angels, ‘‘ Behold, I gave 
unto those pagans spirit, mind, glory, and ruling power, and they bow to sun, moon, 
and stars, which I have created from the aureole of my face.” At that saying they 
tremble, those wheels in the orbits of the sun, moon, and stars, and two destructive 
angels go out to destroy the world on account of their wicked doings, but they give 
up their intention for the sake of the sages who study the law, and the public-school 
children who read the scripture, and for the sake of the whole of Israel who pro- 
claim morning and eyening the Heavenly Kingdom. 
G, I, F. (Gif), do not read Gif only Guf, body, that is the body of the Torah, that 
the teachers ‘of the colleges are trying to explain to Israel as it is written, “They 
will teach thy laws to Jacob.” f 
D, Ch, Z. (Dachaz), do not read Dachaz only ‘“‘Dach Kulu Chefez,” meaning the 
humble one is the whole longing. The pious ones are the “land of desire” of God. 
Why are the pious ones called ‘‘ desire?” Because they fulfill the desire of the 
Almighty. 
Ch. L. K. (Cheleck), meaning part that is Jacob, who is the property of the Lord, 
as the glorious name was sanctified through him and his children, and the Lord has 
engraved his image on his glorious throne. When the children of Jacob say thrice 
a day praise to God, then the Lord kisses his head, which is engraved upon His 
glorious throne. 
How do I know that Jacob is the property of God? Then it is written the property 
of God is his people, Jacob the property of his inheritance. 
N. M. R. (Nmar), meaning ‘he said;” those are the seraphim and fairy angels who 
can not say praise to the glory of the Lord, until Israel has first sanctified his holy 
name, as it is written (Job xxxviii) ‘‘The morning stars sing together and the sons 
of God shout for joy.” The morning stars are the children of Israel, as Moses said, 
and ye are as the stars of the sky. As the stars are shining, so the children of Israel 
are shining through the light of the law, as it is written (Proverbs vi), ‘The good 
deed is a candle and the law is light.” 
S, N. (Son) Sh, T, (Shot) are the initials of the words, ‘‘He bears the Sabbath.” 
When God promised Israel the pleasures of life hereafter in exchange for keeping the 
laws, Israel demanded a sample of that pleasure, and the Lord gaye him the Sabbath. 
 
-P-A-G-E-785
  AN ANCIENT JEWISH PRIMER. 709 
When Nagrasniel, the manager of the Purgatory, asked the Lord, ‘‘ Why didst thou 
not give me that nation of Israel as food for my flames as others?” the Lord replied, 
“All the pagans are written in thy books, with the exception of Israel, as they study 
the law, and Iam with them.” He then asked, ‘‘ Where will they live in life here- 
after?” And the Lord answered, ‘‘In the garden of Eden, full of myrrh and spices, 
whose fragrant air penetrates from one corner of the world to the other.” Then he 
wanted to know how they would enjoy their glorious time, and the Almighty will 
say, ‘With me does not dwell the wicked. Israel will once, in the later days, be 
void of the tempting wicked thought, and neither Satan nor the Angel of Death will 
approach their dwellings.” 
Then Nagrasniel will ask, ‘‘O Lord, Thou givest everyone his daily bread, give 
me also,” and the Lord will say, ‘I have given you all the wicked of the land, liars, 
and the gossipers and worshipers and the evil doers.” 
IN PRAISE OF MUSIC. 
Said Rabbi Akibah, Aleph is the initial of, Truth, learn thy mouth. Tell truth in 
order to have a share in life hereafter. God is truth; His throne is truth, and He 
receives the truth, His words are truth, His ways are truth, and His laws are truth. 
As it is written in the Scriptures, Jehovah Elohim is truth. (Jeremiah x.) 
Aleph is the initial of the words, I will open mouth and tongue. Said the Holy, 
praise Him! I will open the mouths of the children of flesh and blood that they 
shall praise me every day, and proclaim my kingdom into all the corners of the 
universe. If it had not been for the sake of song and music, which they exercise 
for me every day, I would not have created my universe.! 
How do we know that God created the world only for the sake of music andsong? 
Then it is written (Psalm xcvi), ‘Majesty and beauty before Him, might and glory in 
His temple, and of His praise is the earth full.” That God has made the heavens 
only for the sake of music, as it is written (Psalm xix), ‘‘The heavens declare the 
glory of God.” That we know, that the earth sings since she was created, for it is 
written (Isaiah, xxiv), ‘‘From the corner (or border) of the earth we hear a song to the 
righteous, and only God is righteous,” as it is written (Psalm exly), ‘God is righteous 
in all his ways.” How do we know that even seas and streams sing to the Almighty? 
For it is written (Psalm cxlviii), ‘‘Praise the Lord, all the heavens, and the water.” 
Even all the creation praises the Lord with music and song. Even Adam opened 
his mouth with song. (It is a Talmudical legend that Adam was the author of the 
ninety-second chapter of the Psalms.) I will open mouth and tongue, as among the 
two hundred and forty-eight parts of the human body (pretty near to our modern 
teaching of anatomy) with none of them is it so fit to praise the Lord as with mouth 
and tongue. 
Mouth and tongue can be compared only to the ocean and its waves. As the ocean 
opens ajar, so the mouth. As the ocean is full of pearls, so the mouth (alluding to 
the teeth). As the ocean brings forth the water, so the mouth. As the wave is lift- 
ing itself high, so the tongue, As the ocean destroys a ship, so the tongue destroys 
with a word. As the ocean roars, so the mouth. As the waves kill the people, so 
the tongue kills people. As the ocean has borders, so the mouth has borders. As 
he ocean is sometimes calm and sometimes stormy, so the mouth. As all fear the 
waves, so all fear the human tongue. As the outlet of the waters of the ocean turns 
to filth, so the words of the mouth turn into nothingness. God said (so runs another 
version), ‘‘I will open the mouth of Israel to praise my name every day, for nothing 
is pure in the world without Israel and music, as for their sakes the world exists, and 
I created Israel only for the sake of song, as it is written (Isaiah xliv), ‘My nation I 
created my praise to tell.’” 
1 Here we seo plainly how the primer or its author tried to implant into the hearts of the children 
the love of music.—The translator.

If there is no Aleph, then there is no Beth, meaning if there is no learning there 
isno house. If there is no G there is no D, meaning if there is no charity there is no 
poor, and if there is no poor there is no charity. Israel is called poor, as it is written 
(Psalm xviii), ‘‘Thou helpest the poor nation, and the eyes of the proud ones, those 
of the heathen, thou makest down.” 
Another version of the initial of the Aleph is that God says, ‘“‘My truth I have 
deposited by Israel.” When God gave the law to Israel, he promised them the 
pleasure of future life in exchange for keeping the law. Israel demanded a sample 
of that pleasure and the Lord gave them the Sabbath. How do we know that the 
Sabbath is a prototype of future life? For itis written (Psalm xcii), ‘‘ A song to the 
day of Sabbath,” meaning the life hereafter which is an everlasting Sabbath. 
When Adam saw the Sabbath he began to sing the praise of the Holy Onc. At 
that moment the angels went down in parties, some played instruments and others 
different kinds of musical works, praising, singing and saying ‘‘God,” as itis written 
(Psalm), ‘‘To sing to the name of the Most High, to tell at the mornings Thy mercy, 
and at nights Thy truth.” 
The mornings means future life, and nights this life, as it is written (Psalm civ), 
“Thou makest darkness and there is night, there the beasts of the forest are roam- 
ing.” Do the beasts only roam at night, and not at day too? 
But it is alluding to this life which is as dark as night, and the idol worshipers 
which resemble the beasts who roam in the forest at night. When the morning star 
dawns the beasts turn into their dens, so when the morning of the Messiah’s king- 
dom will dawn the heathen will turn back, never to come into life hereafter, as it is 
- written, ‘‘God will be the King of the universe.” 
Aleph means thousand; five thousand gates of wisdom has the Lord opened to 
Moses, corresponding to his five books. Eight thousand gates of “knowledge” cor- 
responding to the eight prophets, and eleven thousand gates of higher wisdom 
corresponding to the eleven books of Scripture (those of Ruth and the like). As it 
is written (Proverbs xxi), ‘‘ A desirable treasure and oil is the dwelling of the sage.” 
A treasure is the law, oil is,tle books of the scripture, calming man like balmy oil. 
Another version of the Aleph is representing the Holy One. As the Aleph is the 
first of all the letters so is God the first of all the kings, and He is also the last of 
the nobles, as it is written (Isaiah 11) ‘‘I the Lord am first, and with the last ones, 
Iam.” Why is it written with the last ones, and not with the lastone? From it wo 
Jearn that when God renews His world Ho himself arranges the order of the Jast 
ones, the order of the pious, the order of the righteous, the order of the humble ones, 
the order of the prophets, the order of kings, of princes, of nobility, of generations, 
the order of every being, the order of every beast and bird, and that of every soul. 
Those arranged in order, He brings down Enoch, the son of Jered, whose proper 
name is ‘‘Mettatron,” and the four hely beasts from under the wheels of His glorious 
throne, and places His throne on one side. Then He brings up Korah and his gang 
from the depth of the purgatory. Then He brings forth all the living visitors of this 
life, placing them on their legs. Then He asks them, ‘Did ye eversee a God like me, 
either in heaven above or on earth beneath, or in any of the four corners of the world? 
Be witness unto me, and say the truth,” as itis written (Isai 3) Ye are my witness 
that lam God!” Then Mettatron and the holy beasts with Korah and his gang will 
say in one voice, ‘We never saw a God like Thee, neither in Heaven above nor on 
earth below; Thou art the first and last, and no other God except Thee, our Lord and 
King,” as itis written (Psalm 86) ‘‘ There is no God like Thee and none as Thy work.” 
At that hour the Lord will reply, ‘Verily, I, Iam and no God with me. I was be- 
fore I created the world and I am with the creation, and I will be a God in life here- 
after. I kill and I will resurrect, I wounded them in this life and will heal them in 
future life. With the same fault with which he parts from this life, with the same 
he will appear at the resurrection—the blind, the lame, the deaf, and the kindred 
afflicted beings. And the Lord will sit as a healer and heal them.’

Why is Aleph written as ono letter and read as asyllablo of three letters. Because 
it represents the Holy One who is one, and the reading of his name isa threefold, as 
it is written ‘‘Hear Israel, (1) God our, (2) Lord, (3) God is one.” His praise and 
sanctification is also a threefold, as it is written “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord 
Zehaath.” Eyen the song is a threefold as the song of songs of Solomon. Song is 
one, songs are two, here is a threefold song.! 
Seventy names has the Holy One, those of the known ones, while the unknown 
are numberless. 
Aléph is the initial of “have chosen,” ‘‘have taken,” “have appointed.” Said the 
Lord, all those are applied to Mettatron my servant, who is sublimer than all the 
celestials. Have chosen him in Adam’s generation, when the generation of the flood 
got wicked, and took away my glory from them (in the text is ‘my Shechina,” 
meaning the divinc womanhood), and went to the heavens amid the blowing of the 
horns, as it is written (Psalm 47), ‘God went on high by the voice of the horns. 
Then I selected Enoch, the son of Jered, from them, to be with me a living witness 
with the four holy beasts in my chariot. I appointed him on allmy treasures in my 
celestial realm, and the keys of them I handed over to him, I made him a prince of 
princes to the glorious throne, a manager to four holy beasts, and to put crowns on 
their heads. . 
I made his height higher than all the celestial beings, 7,000 miles taller. I exalted 
his throne from mine. I turned his body into a flame and his bones into glitter- 
ing light. I made his appearance as the appearance of lightning, his eyes as the 
eternal light, and the reflection of his face as the reflection of the sun, the rays of 
his eyes as tho rays of the glorious throne, his garment of majesty and beauty. I 
crowned him with a crown 500 miles on 500 miles measure, and gave from my majesty 
to him. 
T called him in my name “ Jedud the Little,” who knows all the secrets and mystez- 
ies which I revealed unto him in love. I placed his throne at the entrance of my 
palace, to do judgment among the celestial family. Seventy names I named him in 
order to increase his glory. Seventy princes I placed under him in order to execute 
through them the fates of existence, to uplift the lowly and to make low the proud 
ones, to smite the kings with his word and to humtliate the nobles, to alter the run 
of time and to reveal wisdom to the earthly kings, delivering the secrets to those 
who strive fer knowledge. That Mettatron sits in Heaven three hours each day, 
gathering round him all those souls of infants, sucklings, and of school children who 
died before their times. He gathers them under the glorious throne, dividing them 
in divisions and sections, and teaches them the law, wisdom and knowledge, and all 
the secrets of the Torah, as it is written (Isaiah 28), ‘‘To whom will he teach 
wisdom, to whom will he explain the tidings? To those who were deprived from 
milk, taken from off the breasts.” 
    
    THE PRINCE OF WISDOM. 
Sagnasel is the Prince of Wisdom. Why is his name Sagnasal? Because the 
treasures of wisdom are given into his hand. All those treasures were opened to 
while on Mount Sinai, where Sagnasel taught him the law in seventy lan- 
sand in seventy ways. The prophets, the oral laws, and all knowledge per- 
taining to religion he taught him in seventy ways. At the expiration of his forty 
days Moses forgot all in one hour, and the Holy One called upon Jefeifia, the prince 
of the law, and presented him as a gift to Moses, and then his memory was strength- 
ened, Those ninety-two names of the Holy One, names of the outspoken name,    
'Phe following chapter must have been for the last standard of the grammar school. Its mystical 
environment, its more completed narratives, indicated the character and purpose of that portion of 
the “reader.” Tho so oft-cited sentences of tho Scripture were probably calculated to impress the 
pupil with the idea that the Bible is the source of all knowledge, training him to study and te know

which are engraved upon the glorious throne, which the Holy One gave from His 
name to Mettatron, and the twenty-two seals by which all the celestial orders are 
sealed, also the books of kings and of angels, of the Grim Messenger, and the books 
of fate of every nation. 
Said Mettatron, the prince of the interior, the prince of the law, the prince of 
wisdom, the prince of glory, the prince of the palace, the prince of the angels, the 
prince of princes above and below, that the Lord, the God of Israel is my witness, 
that when I revealed that secret to Moses there arose an uproar among the celestial 
hosts, and they protested. They said to me, ‘‘ Why do you reveal that secret to the 
sons of man, born from a woman, who are full of faults, unclean, full of blood and 
disease? Why do you reveal that secret by which the creation was called into 
existence, why do you reveal to man of flesh and blood?” I replied to them, 
“Because I took a permit from the Holy One. Therefore I revealed to him the 
meanings of the names going out from light and fire.” They were not satisfied with 
my explanations, and the Lord said, ‘‘I want so, and J appointed Mettatron alone, 
and he can give it to Moses.” Moses delivered that to Jehoshua, and Jehoshua to 
the elders, and the elders to the prophets, the prophets to the men of the great 
synod, and the great synod to Ezra the scribe, and Ezra to Hillel the Great, and 
Hillel to Rab Ahluhu, and Rab Ahluhu to the men of faith (the Essenes), and the 
men of faith to the people of religions to take care of it, and to heal by it all the dis- 
eases, as it is written, if thou hear and keep the words of the Lord I will not bring 
upon thee the plagues I brought down upon Egypt, as I, thy God, am thy healer. 
B reads as Beth, which means a house (the initials of Beth). Said the Lord, I 
builded, I formed, I prepared, I builded my two palaces, one in Heaven and the 
other on earth. I formed all the orders of creation. I prepared the future life. 
Why has God created the world with the letter B? Because the Lord knew that 
the world would be twice destroyed, once by the generation of the flood and once at. 
the end of 6093 years since the creation. (The letter B is in Hebrew No. 2.) 
Another reason, as the temple will be destroyed twice. For he created two worlds, 
life here and life to come. For God said, I created two palaces, one for me and the 
other for the sons of man, as it is written (Psalms), ‘‘Heaven belongs to the Lord, 
the earth he gaye to the sons of man.” 
Said the Holy One, for the people will have two kinds of worship, Israel will wor- 
ship me, the pagans, idols. Another reason, because the people have a dual thought, 
one good and the other eyil. 
Three are called ‘‘first,” the Torah, Israel, and the fear of the Lord, and for their 
sake the world was created. By the Torah is written (Proverbs 14), ‘‘The Lord 
bought me, the first of His way.” ‘‘Israel,” as it is written (Jeremiah), ‘holy is 
Israel to the Lord, the first of his fruit.” Fear of the Lord is also called “first,” as 
it is written (Proverbs 1), ‘‘The first of wisdom is the fear of the Lord.” 
B is Binda, knowledge or understanding. Without understanding the world could 
not exist even one hour, as it is written (Deuteronomy), “Select from you men of 
wisdom and understanding.” When God requested Moses to select men of under- 
standing to make them tribal leaders, Moses went throughout all the camps of Israel - 
to seek for men of understanding, and he could not find them. 
Understanding is dearer to the Almighty than the Torah; if a man knows all the 
laws of the Torah, all the scripture, all the knowledge, and has not the understand- 
ing, he has nothing acquired. 
G is the initial of Charity. If there was no charity the world could not exist. The 
Lord said, If it had not been for my charity the world could not exist. What is the 
charity that God does to this world daily? It consists in giving the people spirit, 
wisdom, understanding, thought, power, light of the eyes, hearing of the ears, 
motion of the feet, feeling of the hands, the opening of the mouths, and the talk of 
the tongue. As it is written (Psalm 33), ‘‘The charity of the Lord is full on the 
earth.” Spirit and soul, as it is written that the Lord blew into his nostrils a living

breath. Wisdom, as it is written, ‘The Lord gives from this mouth wisdom and 
knowledge.” The sense of hearing, as it is written, “And the ears of the deaf will 
be opened.” Walk of the legs, as it says, ‘Then the legs of the lame will jump as 
adeer.” Feeling of the hand, as it is said, ‘‘Lift ye your hands in holiness.” Open- 
ing of the mouth, as it says, ‘‘ Who made a mouth to man?” Talk of the tongue, as 
it is written (Proverbs), ‘‘To man is the array of heart’s feelings, but from the Lord 
is the reply of the tongue.” 
D,H. Said the Lord, ‘‘My word stands forever in Heaven.” The word represents 
the angel of healing, as it is written (Psalms), ‘‘He sends his word, and he heals 
them.” Word is the power of prophecy, as it says, ‘‘And He put His word in the 
mouth of Balaam.” 
Dalit is the initial of the Lord’s promise. 1 say to uplift the poor, as the people are 
not favorable to the poor, as it says, ‘‘The wisdom of the poor is disregarded.” But 
when a poor man prays to me, I do not turn him empty, as it is written (Psalms), 
“God comforts the ashamed poor.” The Holy One looks every moment to the poor, 
and his words are sweeter to Him than the utterances of others, as it is written 
(Psalms), ‘‘Then the Lord listens to the poor, and makes not ashamed his prisoners,” 
those afflicted people, who are imprisoned by their ailments and disease. 
Why does the D face the H? Because he who is poor in this life will be rich in life 
hereafter, like Israel who is poor here, but will be rich in future life, Again, the 
heathen who are rich here will be poor yonder in the future life. 
Why are the wicked prospering? Because God gives them their reward here for 
the few good deeds they do. For instance, some wicked do charitable works, not for 
charity’s sake, but for the sake of their name being praised, and so they are rewarded. 
here with wealth. 
If a man in Israel, who is born under a favorable planet to live a good, happy life, 
and acknowledge the Lord with all his heart, is humble in his ways and manners, 
and does not treat the poor in a haughty way, and does not curse, and gives from his 
wealth to the poor, and to the rich in the shape of a loan, such a man will eat the 
fruit in this lite while the main stock will remain for him in future life and he will 
become one of the saints on high. 
H, or Hei, is the sacred name of the Holy One, by which he created the world, as 
it is written (Genesis), ‘Those are the histories of heaven and earth, when they 
were created.” (The initials of the words ‘“ they were created” is H.) 
From it you learn that the Almighty had no trouble in creating the universe, as 
the medium he used was the H, the lightest of all the letters (in pronunciation). 
All the letters, if they are pronounced, he feels through the various organs, as 
tongue, lips, teeth, and the letters are accompanied by the unclean saliva, but the 
H, or ‘‘Hei” is pure, as when pronounced, no organ is required to help, and no saliva 
accompanies it. 
All the pronounced names of the Holy One are written with H, and with it 
heaven, earth, this life and life hereafter, and the messianic time, were sealed by it. 
The letters by which heaven and earth were sealed are twelve, corresponding to 
the twelve hours of the day and those of the night, to the twelve months of the 
year, corresponding to the twelve planets in the Zodiac. To the twelve tribes cor- 
responding to the twelve continents, bearing the twelve names of the twelve tribes, 
as itis written, ‘‘He placed the borders of the nations to the numbers of Israel’s 
tribes.” All those letters are as fire, and they glitter as lightning, and each letter 
measures 21,000 miles, and on each are chained crowns of glory as they are engraved 
by the finger of the Holy One. 
They are also the seals of the Lord, with which he seals all the souls on the 
glorious chariot. Each name has a special seal. The Lord sits on a throne of fire, 
surrounded by fire pillars with the sacred names thereon. By each pillar numberless 
angels of fire are standing. When a man knows those names, and makes use of 
them, all the heavens are filled with fire, and they go down to burn the earth, but 
ED 96——23*

(14 “EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
the heayens are linked and chained to the borders of the earth, and seeing the seal 
of the Holy One, they are filled with the spirit of mercy and do not destroy the 
earth. 
S, or Sain, is the name of the Holy One, as Sain means “maintainer,” as the Lord 
is the maintainer of all. 
The Almighty has the key of woman, as it is written, ‘He opened her womb;” 
the key of rain, as it is written, ‘‘He will open you his best treasure;” the key of 
maintenance, as it is written, “ Thou openest Thy hand to satisfy all with good will;” 
the key of human structure; the key of manna, as it is written, ‘‘He opened the 
heavens above;” the key of kingdoms; the key of eyes, as it is written, ‘‘Then the 
eyes of the blind will be opened;” the key of the deaf, as it is written, ‘‘ The cars 
of the deaf will be opened;” the key of the lips, as it is written, ‘‘The Lord will 
open my lips;” the key of the mouth, as it is written, ‘‘And the Lord opened the 
mouth of the ass;” the key of the tongue; the key of the earth, as it is written, 
“The earth shall open and flourish salyation;” the key of the prisoners, as it is 
written, ‘‘The Lord makes loose the bound ones;” He has the key of Eden, as it is 
written, ‘‘Opened to me the gates of righteousness; He has the key of the purga- 
tory, asit is written, ‘‘ Opened the gates and let enter the pious nations keeping the 
truth.” 
Do not read Amonim (Truth) only “Amanim,” as for the sake of “Amen,” which 
the wicked say in the purgatory, they are redeemed from it. In the later days the 
Lord will sit in Eden and explain the laws while all the good ones will sit and the 
celestial family will be on his right, and sun and moon with all the planets to the 
left, and the Lord will explain the laws of the new Torah, which will be given 
through the Messiah. At the end, Zembabel will stand up and say, ‘Exalted and 
sanctified shall be the Holy great name.” His voice will be heard from one corner 
of the universe to the other, and all existence will say “Amen.” The wicked of 
Israel and those of the heathen in the purgatory will also say “Amen,” and their 
voices will reach before the Lord. The Lord will.inquire for them, and tho angels 
of the service will say that they are the voices of the wicked condemned in the pur- 
gatory. At that moment the Lord will show His merey and hand over to Michael 
and Gabriel the keys of the purgatory to bring them forth from there. 
At that time the two archangels will go and open the forty thousand gates of hell. 
Tho hell is 300 miles long, 300 miles broad, 1,000 miles thick, 1,000 deep, and when a 
wicked man falls into it, he never can get out. 
The two archangels at that time will bring those condemned forth, they will be 
washed and cleansed, their wounds healed, and they will be dressed in pure rays of 
garment and brought before the glorious throne. When they will be before tho 
Lord, they will fall on their faces, bowing, praising the Holy name.. At that moment 
all will join in the eternal praise of the Lord! 
Ch, or Chet, means sin. When the wicked are punished in the purgatory for their 
sins, they repent and they are forgiven and share the future life with all the pious and 
good ones, and they sit near the ‘‘Schechina” (divine womanhood), as they save 
their broken hearts with repentance, as it is written (Psalm 34), ‘God is nigh to 
the broken hearts,” and they are dearer to the Lord than the angels. 
The angels are distant from the ‘ Schechina” 36,000 miles, as it is written, “Sera- 
phim stand above him.” 
“Above” in geometrical calculation is ‘thirty-six thousand.” The Sehechina is 
measured twice thirty-six times ten thousand miles, and the celestial mile is thousands 
of cubits; a cubit is four span and a fist, and a span measures from one corner of the 
world to the other. The earth is only one foot long, one foot broad, and one foot 
high up to the first heaven, and yet, those broken-hearted through repentance are 
nigh to the Schechina. 
But those who are proud, the Lord is far from them. Those who are proud are 
like idol worshipers, and if a man is like Moses, our master peace with him, and has 
pride, he will not escape the punishment of the hell.

F,orFeth. Feth means “lime;” that is, the lime from which all was created, and 
to which all returns, as it is written, ‘All was from dust and all returns to dust,” 
and dust islime. Lime is the lime of the future, from which all the good ones will 
flourish in parties, as the grass of the field with many garments, whose perfume will 
fill the whole of the universe, as the perfume of ‘‘Hden,” as it is written (Psalms 
xlii), ‘They will flourish from the city as the grass of the field.” The city is Jerusa- 
lem, as the Lord will start the resurrection only from Jerusalem, as it is written 
(Ezechiel), ‘I will give an ornament in the land of the living.” Is there a dead 
land? It means Palestine, which is called ‘‘ The land of the living,” as her dead will 
be resurrected first. 
What will become of those pious ones who are dead in other lands? But at the 
day of resurrection the Lord will say to the angels, ‘‘Go forth and lift up the surface 
of the ground, and make tunnels through which to bring the good ones from foreign 
lands to Jerusalem.” The angels will take up the four corners of the globe, and 
shake the wicked from it, and the good ones will be brought to Jerusalem through 
tunnels; there the Lord himself will resurrect them. 
How will the resurrection take place? The Lord will take a trumpet measuring 
a thousand cubits, the cubits of the Lord, and will blow so that it will be heard from 
one corner of the world to the other. 
At the first blow the world will be shaken up. At the second blow the ground 
will be divided. At the third blow the bones will be gathered. At the fourth blow 
the portions of the bodies will be warmed up. At the fifth blow their skins will be 
shaped. At the sixth blow the soul will be returned into their respective bodies, 
At the seventh blow they will stand up alive with their garments on. 
J, or Jod, means hand and might. We iearn from it that the Lord will give in the 
later days a might, a foothold to the pious ones, as it is written, ‘‘I will give unto 
them a hand and a good name in my house and my wall 
House means the temple, as it is written, “And my house will be called the worship 
house of all nations.” 
Wall means Jerusalem, as it is written, ‘‘ Upon thy walls, Jerusalem, I appointed 
watches!” 
Jod means also gifts, as the Lord will present gifts to all the pious ones, each one 
with a cup of life’s elixir in order to live forever. 
Name means that the Lord will reveal to them the pronounced name by which he 
lias created the heavens and earth, in order that they shall be able to create worlds 
too. Each pious one will get three hundred and forty worlds as a reward for his - 
gooddeeds. They willhave an everlasting name means the pronounced sacred name, 
with which future life was created. Praise and exaltation that will be the light of 
their eyes where at one glance they will be able to see from one part of the world to 
the other. 
Kaf, or K, means the hand of swearing (as by swearing we lift up the hand). It 
will be a hand clutching of joy at the banquet which God will tender to the right- 
eous at the later days when with each one the ‘‘Schechina” will walk, accompanied 
by tens of thousands of angels, around them pillars of lightning, and the elements 
will dance before them. 
Upon that time the prophet said, ‘‘O Lord, uplifted is Thy hand.” At that 
banquet, Isaiah will say ‘‘O Lord, uplift Thy hand, let not the wicked see the 
pleasures of the good ones.” The Lord will reply, ‘‘No; contrary, let them come, and 
be ashamed ;” then the prophet will say, ‘‘No; let them not come, and not see.” 
The Jewish nationality will be called upon to settle that dispute. Mettatron will 
bring the Jewish nationality before the Lord. Then she will say, ‘For what am I 
called here?” Then the Lord will say, ‘My dear daughter, I like that the wicked 
shall come and see the pleasures of the good ones.” ‘Let them come,” she will say, 
“Cand be ashamed.” 
At that time the wicked will come at the doors of Eden to look and behold the

  716 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
pleasures of the pious ones. They will see how everyone is clad in garment accord- 
ingly, and before each is a table of pearl, and before everyone there is a golden 
cup mounted with precious stones, while the cup is filled with life elixir, and on the 
table are arrayed many dishes of agietod food, and before everyone the angels are 
waiting. 
Their seem to reflect rays of light as that of the sun, penetrating from one 
end of the world to the other, while the heavens will open their doors, showering 
upon them a shower of perfumed dew, and its aroma will fill all the spaces in the 
universe, and millions of angels, harps in hand, will play and sing, while the sun, 
moon, and the planets will dance. 
When the wicked see those glorious things they will ask why is such an honor 
and pleasure given to those? And the angels will answer, because they kept the 
laws. Then the wicked will fall upon their faces praising the Lord, saying, ‘Mail 
to the nation, that such is to him; hail to the nation, that the Lord is his God.” 
(Psalms exliv.) 
L, or Lamed, is the initial of ‘(Heart understands knowledge.” The heart is a 
reproduction of man; since man has eyes, so has the heart; man has ears, so has the 
heart; man has a mouth, so has the heart; man has utterances, so the heart; man 
roars, so the heart; man cries, so the heart; man walks, so the heart. The heart 
sees, as it is written (Preacher i), ‘‘My heart saw wisdom.” The heart hears, as it 
is written (Kings iii), ‘‘A heart to hear to judge.” The heart talks, as it is written 
(Preacher iv), ‘I spoke with my heart.” The heart cries, as it is said (Lamentations), 
“Their hearts cried unto the Lord.” Man is consoled, so the heart; as it is said, 
“And He consoled them, and spoke with their heart.” Man legislates,so the heart; as 
it is said (Judges viii), ‘‘ My heart to legislate to Israel.” Man roams, so the heart; as 
it says (Psalms xly), ‘‘My heart roams a good thing.” Man rejoices, so the heart; as 
it is written (Samuel ii), ‘‘My heart rejoices in the Lord.” Man is clean, so the 
heart; as it says (Psalms li), ‘‘A clean heart, create in me, O Lord.” Man mourns, 
so the heart; as it says (Genesis), ‘‘And he mourned in his heart.” Manis awakened, 
so the heart; as it is written (Song of Songs), ‘‘I slept, but my heart was awakened.” 
Man inquires, so the heart; as it says (Preacher i), “‘I turned my heart to inquire.” 
Man is wise, and so the heart; as it is written (Proverbs), ‘‘The wise heart takes to 
good deeds.” Man is good, and the heart; as it is written (Proverbs), ‘A good 
heart is always jolly.” 
All that is in man is contained in the heart, and the heart is equal to the two hun- 
dred and forty-eight portions of the body. There are twelve actions and qualities 
distributed to the various instruments of the body. 
The brain acts through thought and is the thinking machine. The mouth divides 
the food, the tongue smooths the ground food, the pipes of the lungs do the breath- 
ing, and so on. 
But hate, love, envy, dwell only in the heart; therefore it is said, ‘‘Do not hate 
thy brother in thy heart; love thy God with all thy heart.” God therefore looks only 
into the heart; as it is written, ‘‘Man sees with the eyes, while God looks into the 
heart.” 
M, or Mim, Why pronounced with both letters? Because both are on the height of 
the glorious throne, where they chain the crowns of light. When the time for sancti- 
fication comes, and God does not step down from His height, they approach each 
other saying, ‘‘ When will I come to see the face of the Lord?” (Psalms.) When 
the Lord comes down then all the letters open their mouths with song of praise, 
the open M says, ‘‘ Thy kingdom is forever,” while the closed M says, ‘ And Thy realm 
is in all the generations.” 
At that time the Lord takes all the letters and kisses them, placing two crowns 
upon each—the one the crown of glory, the other a crown of glory. ‘To the open M 
He gives two crowns, and to the closed M one of ruling and other of majesty, and places 
oneto His rightand the other letter to His left, saying, ‘‘ My letters, which 1 engraved 
with pen of fire, my kingdom is only proclaimed through you.”     
   
         
   
-P-A-G-E-793
    AN ANCIENT JEWISH PRIMER. TAG 
With the open M the Lord is called ‘‘King of Kings,” while with the closed M He 
is called ‘‘ Ruler of Rulers.” When the two M’s hear it, they open their mouths in 
song of praise, and all the celestials come, fall, and bew before the Holy One, sing- 
ing and praising the Almighty. 
N,or Nun. Why is the one N straight and the other in a resting attitude? Because 
with them was the soul of man created, as every soul. Sometimes it rests and some- 
times it stands. When she (the soul) is in the body she is resting, and when she is 
out of the body she is standi 
A king wanted once to enter his palace, which was an unclean place, and he says 
to his servant, Bring the candle in. So the Lord created man from dust, blood, and 
gall; therefore He placed in him the soul in order to see what goes on in that dark, 
unclean place, and the soul is the candle of the Lord (Proverbs xxvi). The soul of 
man is the candle of the Lord, not that of the animal, as the soul of the latter has 
rest, while that of the former has no rest. 
When man dies, his soul is brought before the celestial bench, and there all the 
deeds are arrayed, and the judges tell all he did on that day or on that hour and 
place; even the private conversation between husband and wife is recorded. If he 
lost his children when he was alive, they ask him, ‘Why did you lose your children?” 
If he was blinded, or became deaf in life, they ask him to account for it, as the ways 
of the Lord are even and only sinners are stumbling on them. They ask him why 
he stumbled on his sin. If he can give a reasonable answer, they accept it; if not, he 
is whipped with a whip of fire and he turns into ashes. The ashes are scattered to 
all four corners of the world, then they are collected by four angels, an angel to each 
corner, and they put the ashes in the grave, to be there till judgment day. 
S, or Samech, means the leaner, and it represents the Lord, who leans the fallen 
ones, t is written (Psalms cxly), ‘‘The Lord leans the fallen ones.” He leans the 
heavens as well as the globes of the planets below them. Samech means also 
the Torah, which is leaned on the prophet, books of the scribes, and on the oral 
law, as it is witten, ‘‘The well which was dug by the princes, by the nobles of 
the nations.” Well means the Torah, asi ig water.” And the 
law is always compared to water, as it says, ‘‘He who is thirsty, go to the water.” 
Why are the words of the Torah compared to water? Because as water leaves 
the highest and comes down, so the Torah likes only him who is humble. ‘Dug by 
princes,” they are Moses and the seventy elders who explained the Jaws in seventy 
languages. ‘The nobles of the nation,” they are the scribes, as David, Solomon, 
Ezra, who have explained the law to Israel. 
E, or Ain, means the eye of the law, which is the eye of all eyes and the wisdom 
of all wisdom, as it is written (Psalms xix), ‘‘The law of the Lord enlightens the 
eyes.” Wisdom is only the wisdom of the law, as it is written, ‘“Ye shall keep my 
laws, as they are your wisdom and understanding.” 
P, or Pe, means mouth, and mouth means Moses, as it is written (Exodus), “I am 
ahard mouth, and astutterer of tongue.” Moses said to the Lord, ‘I know Thou 
art the only God, and Thou hast created the world only for Thy own honor, and 
created man only to do Thee honor, and every portion of the body Thou hast 
created for some purpose to serve Thee. The head to bow before Thee, the eyes to 
see Thy glory, the ears to hear Thy honor, the nose to smell, the teeth to grind the 
food, the pipe to give in and to give out. The veins as. blood vessels, the skin for 
complexion, hands to fight and to work, feet to walk, tongue to talk. Now give me 
talkative power.” The Lord replied, ‘‘Who made the mouth and tongue to Adam? 
Of course I did it.” 
Z, or Zadic, means the righteous of the world, God Himself, as He does right to 
every creature in the universe. If God had not given to man mouth and tongue the 
world could not exist fora moment, When Moses refused to accept the mission on 
account of being a stutterer the creatures of the world began to tremble, saying, 
“Behold Moses who once will speak with the Schechina one hundred and seventy- 
five times face to face and will explain every letter and law in seventy languages, 
           
-P-A-G-E-794
    718 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
     yet he says, ‘I am a stutterer ;’ what shall we say For that, that Moses made him- 
self incapable on account of his mouth, the Lord uplifted him, as it is written, ‘‘and 
Iwas standing between you and the Lord,” a position which even Mettatron can not 
haye. For the plea that he pleaded, ‘‘I am hard of talk,” the Lord speaks of him, 
“Moses, face to face I speak with him God has appointed Moses as a treasury over 
all the creation, as itis said, ‘‘Moses, my servant, the faithful in my household.” 
When Moses reached the department of the future and saw the parties of sages, of 
the Sansechrin, of the Rabbis, explaining the law in forty-nine ways, and then he 
saw the college of Rabbi Akibah, who explains three hundred and sixty-five reasons 
for the laws, he said, ‘‘T do not want to be the messenger of the Lord.” But the 
Lord knew the reason of his refusal, so He sent Sagnasel, the Prince of Wisdom, to 
Moses, and he brought him into the colleges where the laws are taught. 
"There Moses heard the Rabbis saying “That law, as well as this law, is delivered 
by Moses from Sinai.” As Moses heard this he was calm, and with satisfaction 
accepted the mission as a redeemer. 
K, or Kof, means Moses who surrounded Pharaoh with all words of wisdom in sey- 
enty tongues. When Moses and Aaron appeared before the king they found there 
seventy writers writing the correspondence in seventy languages. 
As soon as they beheld the two messengers, how their faces were shining like the 
sun, and each word they uttered was of fire, and ing the stick upon which was 
engrayed the pronounced name, they began to tremble, throwing away their pens 
and letters, bowing in fear before Moses and Aaron. 
Then the king asked them, ‘Who has sent youtome?” They replied, “‘The God of 
the Hebrews.” He asked again, ‘(What is His name, what of His strength, how 
many countries has He cenquered, how many are the numbers of His fighting army?” 
They answered him, ‘‘ His strength is full the universe, Heayen is His throne, His word 
is fire and shakes up mountains, His bow is fire, His arrows are of fire. Te is the cre- 
ator of all and the peacemaker between fire and water. With His word He created 
the world, by utterance formed the mountains, and by wisdom He creates the child 
in the womb of his mother. He clothes the skies with clouds, and lets rain fall upon 
the earth to maintain the life ofall.” Said the king to them, ‘(Ido not need Him, as 
I created myself,” as it is written (Ezechiel xxviii) ‘‘Mine is the Nile and I created 
me. What-you say,” the king continued, “that He makes rain and dew; my Nile 
~ waters my land to bring forth the sweetest fruit. But wait; I will bring the mem- 
oranda of yore, containing the letters of ancient kings; perhaps I will find among 
them some letters of your God, for, so far as I know, He never has sent to me any 
writings or greetings.” He opened his musenm and called upon the seventy writers 
to read in seventy languages at the same time. Not finding His name, he said to 
Moses and Aaron, ‘‘I know neither of Him nor of His might.” Hethensent word to 
all the wise men in Egypt to inquire, and they said, ‘‘Yes; we heard about the name 
of their God; we heard that He is the son of wise, the son of ancient kings.” At that 
time the Lord said, ‘ Fools, ye call yourselves ‘ wise ones’ and me the son of wise, 
the son of kings,” as it is written (Isaiah xiv), ‘‘Only fools are the princes of

Pharaoh that I am the son of wise, the son of kings?” 
R, or Reish, is the Almighty, who is the head of the world and its end. R is the 
word of the Lord by which He has created the seven heavens. R is the meaning of

Sh, or Shein, means teeth; those are the teeth of the wicked, which will be broken 
three times—one time here in this life, second in life hereafter, third in the Messianic 
time. As the Shein has three heads, so the Almighty will break the teeth of the 
wicked three times. 
The teeth of the wicked will grow out of their mouths 22 cubits long at the time

CHAPTER XY. 
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE, PARTICULARLY IN 
AUSTRIA, FRANCE, AND GERMANY.! 
The American Bankers’ Association has led the way in one of the most important 
educational departures of this century. It is nothing less than a systematic effort 
to arouse public attention to the importance of providing for a more extensive and 
more thorough professional education of our business classes. 
As the first step in this work, the association appointed a committee to investigate 
what was being done in a systematic way in the United States toward providing for 
this great public need of a special education for mercantile and business life. With 
a full recognition of the admirable work which many of our so-cailed ‘‘commercial 
colleges” are doing, and with the completest acknowledgment that their founders 
and promoters were the first to see the need of special commercial education and were 
doing valuable work in supplying it so far as they could, the committee felt that there 
was a field of education which these institutions were not at all cultivating, and yet 
which needed special attention. In canvassing the educational institutions of the 
country, it soon appeared that the Wharton School of Finance and. Economy of the 
University of Pennsylvania was the only institution of higher rank which was busying 
itself seriously with this educational problem. The committee, therefore, requested 
the author of this report to give the association an account of the work, aims, and 
methods of the Wharton School. In an address delivered before that body at Saratoga, 
in September, 1890,? the general situation of business education was discussed and 
an exposition of the work of the Wharton School was given. So weil pleased was the 
association with the plan there outlined and the report of the work already accom- 
plished that it adopted resolutions recommending to the colleges and universities in 
the United States the establishment of similar departments as constituent parts of 
their organization. 
This action attracted much attention and the scheme received the approval of 
leading college and university authorities, as well as business men.* 
Pursuing the same line of work, the association resolved to investigate what was 
being done in the field of secondary education corresponding to the work of the 
Wharton School of Finance and Economy in higher education. As it was generally 
known that the various countries of western Europe had done much work along this 
line, the author of the present report was invited to visit the leading centers of 
European education and examine their institutions for commercial education and 
report upon thissubject. In pursuance of this invitation, he visited England, France, 
Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and Belgium, and the following report incor- 
porates some of the results of his observation and study of this topic. The essence 
of the report has already been submitted to the association, at its last meeting, in an 
address delivered in San Francisco September 7, 1892.4 
The object in preparing the various detailed reports which constitute this work 
was to put the available information relating to these schools, their history, origin, 
development, curricula, etc., into such a form that any member of this association, or 
of any similar body, any teacher in the United States, any superintendent of schools, 
any school board, or any other body or individual who might become interested in 
this subject and who might wish to take the initiative in organizing such schools 
among us would find the assistance he needs in taking the first steps toward such 
an end.

  422 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
The object of this report, then, has not been to present a complete account of the 
system of commercial education in Europe, nor complete statistical tables as to num- 
ber of schools, pupils, teachers, etc., but rather to select a few typical institutions 
and describe them so fully that anyone who chose to do so, by making allowance for 
the difference in conditions, could reproduce their counterparts here, 
The special accounts contain many references to the burning questions of educa- 
tional policy which will prove of interest to the educational specialist. 
It is my opinion that the educational system of the United States would be enor- 
mously improved by the introduction of such schools as are described in this report 
into our scheme of public instruction, and if the American Bankers’ Association shall 
haye contributed, even to a smallextent, to this great result it will have deserved the 
thanks of every American citizen. 
Ihave set forth in the two addresses delivered before the association, in consid- 
erable detail, the reasons for believing that a system of institutions of secondary and 
higher rank should be organized with a special view of offering facilities for a pro- 
fessional education along business and commercial lines. The schools of secondary 
rank would be commercial high schools, running parallel with our present literary 
high schools on the one hand ‘and manual- training high schools on the other. The 
schools of higher rank should be of college and uniy ersity grade, and should be 
organized in connection with our sting colleges and universities 
The commercial high schools could be “established by private parties, cither indi- 
viduals or corporations, much as our academies and seminaries are organized and 
managed now. Some of the most successful of these schools have > been. thus estab- 
lished in Europe, notably in Paris, Vienna, and Turin. Or they might be established 
by boards of trade, chambers of commerce, trades leagues, or other similar bodies, 
This also has been a familiar form of organization and | ‘support in Europe. Indeed, 
it may be said that some of the most successful of the European schools have been 
managed on this plan: The School of Higher Commercial Studies at Paris, the 
Academy at Prague, and the Institute at Leipsic. 
Or they might be established by the community as integral parts of the public- 
school system. A start has been made along this line at Pittsburg Cincinnati, and 
San Francisco, in this country; but these schools haye not been dev eloped as they 
ought to be It is undoubtedly true that in the long run we shall have to rely upon 
this third form to accomplish the most general and widespread results; but there is 
also just as little doubt that more rapid progress might be made if some private 
individual or corporation would take up the matter and give us a commercial high 
school which could serve as a model for our city boards, ‘for the history of educa 
tion in this country shows conclusively that the spirit of routine and formali 
which nearly invariably prevails in any public-school system is unfavorable to rapid 
and thoroughgoing improvement, inasmuch as it is unfavorable to experimentation, 
and experimentation is necessary to progress. 
The systematic and steady development of commercial instruction lies in the 
interest of our business world, in the interest of the community in general, and in 
the interest of our public system of education. There is at present little oppor- 
tunity for a youth desiring to enter business life to get any tematic assistance 
in-preparing himself for his future career, if he desires or ex ‘pects to engage in any- 
thing but clerical work. The old system ‘of training young men in the great busi- 
ness houses has almost completely disappeared, even in those places in our country 
where it may have existed; while it can hardly be said ever to have existed at 
all in most places in this country. Even in the old countries—England, France, and 
Germany—it has broken down, like the apprenticeship system in ‘the trades s, apd at 
present the only possible substitute for it seems to be the properly organized com- 
mercial school. 
It may be said that the best preparation is a good general education of the literary 
high school and college. This has always been the answer to ev ery proposition to 
organize professional or technical education. It is essentially the medieval idea of 
education, and it dies only very slowly and very hard in the face of modern progress. 
The best practical answer to it is the fact that practical men as a class w ill have 
nothing to do with it. Opportunities for such education have been open to the busi- 
ness classes for three centuries, and they have availed themselves of them only to a 
very limited extent cither in Europe or America; while whenever a special educa- 
tion of high rank has been open to them they have shown their appreciation of it 
by patronizing the institutions which offered it. 
The fact seems to be thatin every line of educational life the number of people who 
will take a very extensive course of study of a purely liberal character is very small 
indeed, while the number of those who will take an extensive special or professional 
education is large and continually growing. Indeed, if you were to cut out of our 
present so- called. liberal courses those persons to whom the study of Latin, Greek, 
istory, mathematics, science, etc., is not only a liberal but also a technical “pursuit

    COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 723 
in the sense of preparing them directly for their future work, viz, teachers, preach- 
ers, lawyers, physicians, the number left in these courses would be astonishingly 
small, 
We can conquer the uneducated and half educated people of this country for 
secondary and higher education only by offering them courses of study which, while 
they are of a strictly educational character in the best sense of the word, shall also 
have some bearing on their future every day life, shall have some direct relation to 
the work they are called upon to do in the world. 
The first aim of an educational system should undoubtedly be to offer general or 
liberal courses of all grades, and of the very best possible character, and get as 
many people to pursue these courses as possible, no matter what their future careers. 
It should, then, go further and offer to those youth who have gone as far as they will 
in these liberal courses an opportunity to pursue their education still further along 
lines relating to their future calling—an education which, if it is based on science and 
be properly organized, can not but be liberalizing, no matter if it be technical in the 
ordinary sense of the term. Nobody can doubt that the training of a properly 
organized and managed law school is not merely technical or professional in nature, 
but also highly liberalizing, particularly as compared with the training of an ordinary 
law office: Nor will anyone deny that the work of a good manual training or trade 
high school may be made educational in avery high sense. In the same way the 
curriculum of a commercial high school may be eminently liberalizing in all its ten- 
dencies, at the same time that it trains a youth so that he may be more useful in a_ 
business house. 
Such a high schoo] may be of great advantage to the youth whose father is able 
to set him up in business, or by his business connections may be able to start him 
far up the hill that leads to business success, for it will be able to impart to him 
much information which he would otherwise obtain in a scrappy way and often not 
at all until the opportunity to use it had passed him by; and at any rate it would 
prepare him to acquire quickly the details of his business and help him to coordi- 
nato his knowledge so as to make it of the greatest useto him. It would, moreover, 
quicken his interest in all that relates to business, and help make his business life a 
source of pleasure as well as profit to him. 
If such a training would help the youth of fortune and good business connections, 
it would be of immensely greater aid to the youth who must start at the bottom and 
has only himself and his own efforts to rely upon. It would enable him to acquire 
in a much shorter time the details of any business he chooses to take up; it would 
open his eyes to business chances; give him a comprehensive view of the business 
world, and help put him ina position to profit by whatever juncture turned up. 
It is said that 95 per cent of those who enter business fail at some time in their 
career, and certainly any business man will confirm the statement that there are far 
moro failures than successes in the business world. These failures come, of course, 
from many circumstances; but there is little doubt that many of them spring from 
causes which the proper sort of preliminary training may remove; and if sound 
business education would serve to turn only 10 per cent of these failures into successes, 
it would pay for itself many times over 
Of course no commercial high school and no school of finance and economy can 
make a successful merchant or banker. Nor does a law school make a successful 
lawyer or a medical school a successful physician; but all three may so train a man 
that he will enter upon his respective career at an advantage over the man who does 
not have this training, provided other things are equal. A good commercial train- 
ing will prepare a boy to learn his business more easily and rapidly than he could 
have done withont it. o 
But such a commercial training must be really educational in character. What 
this means, in the domain of secondary education, can be seen if one will take the 
six-months course of the average so-called commercial college in the United States, 
and compare it with the three-years course of the schools discussed in the second part 
of this volume-—say of that in Vienna, or Prague, or Leipsic, or Antwerp, or of the two 
in Paris. It is work of this latter character which is at once practical and liberal; 
which educates for life while it trains for a livelihood, and which should be intro- 
duced into our scheme of public education. 
It will be noted that all the schools here discussed are really of high- ‘school grade, 
covering the years from 14 or 15 to17 or18. The only exception is to be found in 
such courses as the one-year course for graduates of gymnasia or lycées, like the one 
in Vienna and the school at Venice, which may fairly lay claim to be considered of 
college or university grade. These courses represent really the only attempt to pro- 
vide for higher commercial courses at all and which, therefore, could come into 
comparison with the work which would properly fall within the scope of schools of 
finance and economy. 
The real reason for this is to be found, in my opinion, in the general low social

724 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
estimate set on the business clas*es in Europe which are relegated to a distinctly 
lower position in the social scale than the nobility, the army, and the pro 
classes. Shopkeepers and artisans are classed together, and for neither class is really 
higher education necessary at all. Of course this state of things can not continue 
indefinitely, and there are many signs of its approaching change, and before long we 
may confidently expect to see courses in commerce in the higher schools of Europe 
which will compare favorably with those suitable to schools of finance and economy 
as discussed in this work. 
Attempts have been made to develop courses in business in connection with the 
other courses in the German polytechnic schools; but, as will be seen in the second 
part of this report, they have all been so inadequately organized that they have 
failed of their purpose and are of value to us only assolemn examples to be avoided. 
One interesting thing to note is the récent remarkable increase in attendance at 
French commercial schools. Up to 1890 the certificate of these schools was not 
accepted by the war department as entitling the holders to the privileges of the one- 
year-service law, and so boys who attended them were compelled to pass at least a 
year or two more in other schools for the mere purpose of passing the military exam- 
ination, or else they were obliged to serve the full period in the army. ‘This con- 
stituted a serious handicap for this class of instruction and accounts largely for the 
slow growth in attendance for many years, As soon asthe certificate of these schools 
was put on a par with that of other educational institutions of similar grade, the 
attendance went up by leaps and bounds, showing that it was this artificial barrier 
which kept them back. 
The circumstance mentioned above serves to show the necessity of considering all 
the facts relating to a school system before drawing concrete conclusions or compari- 
sons. It will be seen, for example, that the higher commercial schools in Germany 
give more time to certain subjects than the corresponding ools in France or 
Austria. This does not come, as one might suppose, from a difference in the ideas of 
the German directors of commercial schools, but simply from the fact that the war 
department refused to receive the certificates of these schools as entitling to the 
privileges of the one-year voluntary service until its prescriptions as to certain 
fundamental subjects were complied with. The whole matter illustrates the far- 
reaching influence of the military system in Europe oyer every department of life, 
when even the schools which fit for what is preeminently a peaceful vocation must 
adapt their curricula to the demands of the war office. 
The work of the Free School of Political Science, in Paris, is not noticed in this 
report, because its aim is quite different from that of the other institutions discussed. 
It is a most admirable school and is well worth the study of educationists. Its work 
corresponds at certain points with a portion of the work done in the Wharton School 
of Finance and Economy; but as a purely private institution it stands out of rela- 
tion to the general system of public education in France, having in an official way 
no.connection either with the secondary system on one hand, nor with what cor- 
responds to our college and university system on the other. 
There are some interesting commercial schools in Russia, Holland, and some of the 
other countries in Europe. Russia has what may perhaps be called the oldest com- 
mercial school in the world. But as I was unable to visit the other European coun- 
tries, I thought best not to attempt a description of the schools relying, as I should 
have been obliged to do, entirely on the accounts of others. 
It will be seen that but little space is given to England or English schools. The 
reason is plain to one who knows the facts. There is no institution in Great Britain 
which fairly deserves the name of commercial high school in the sense used iu this 
report. England is beginning to wake up to the necessity of this sort of education. 
Boards of trade, teachers’ conventions, educational societies have all begun to agitate 
for its introduction. The growing displacement of English youth in the great busi- 
ness houses of London by French, German, and even Italian youth began to attract 
public attention more than ten years ago. Finally, some six years ago the London 
Chamber of Commerce took up the subject in earnest, and later the universities of 
Oxford and Cambridge, and then many other institutions and societies. 
Tnstead of taking hold of the subject at the right end and organizing a great insti- 
tution in London, which might serve as a model for such schools elsewhere, the 
English began their work in this field, as in many similar instances, by establishing 
examinations, and granting commercial certificates to all such pupils as could pass 
them. As there were no schools where the candidates could prepare for these examina- 
tions, they had to wait until existing classical or scientific schools could see their way 
to the profitable introduction of the commercial side. When aschool here and there 
finally decided to open a commercial department, it was found that in all England 
there were no properly qualified teachers for this work. The outcome of the examina- 
tion has been, therefore, most unsatisfactory, and there is talk of abolishing those in 
connection with Oxford. The London experiment has been the most successful, and 
it seems likely to continue. But the chief advantage from this movement thus far 
      
        
            
     
-P-A-G-E-801
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 125 
in England has been that it has called public attention to the great need of oppor- 
tunities for some mercantile education of English youth. There is little doubt that 
England will shortly take the matter up in earnest, when we may expect excellent 
results. 
There is little doubt that an association like the American Bankers’ Association, 
however, could do an immense amount toward educating the general public as well 
as bank clerks and officials along a few special lines if it would prepare careful syllabi 
of courses of reading along banking and financial lines, specifying books, order of 
reading, etc., and then provide for examination to be held on the subjects and the 
granting of certificates. The Wharton School of Finance and Economy receives 
letters continually from young men engaged in banks throughout the country asking 
for aid in pursuing their education along special lines relating to banking and finance, 
but its cireumstances do not permit it to do this work at present. This association, 
however, could do this service in an admirable way, and if it should undertake it, 
many men throughout the entire country would rise up and call it blessed. 
There is, at present, a special reason why we in the United States should provide 
facilities for adequate education along mercantile lines in the narrow sense of the 
term. We are rapidly nearing the point in our manufacturing industry when we 
may expect to compete with England, Germany, and France in foreign markets. In 
this field of enterprise England is at great advantage because of long possession ; 
France and Germany, because of the better training and education of their youth 
who enter their business houses in foreign countries. If we wish to find such com- 
petition successful, we must be able to find a ready supply of trained men for foreign 
correspondence and service; men who have had systematic training in foreign lan- 
guages and in the geography and industries of foreign countries. Such a training 
it is the business of a commercial high school to give. 
. The curriculum of a properly organized commercial high school would contain 
many elements of a liberal character. The history of commerce and commercial 
institutions, commercial geography with the necessary preliminary work in physical 
geography, the study of products, the theory and practice of accounting are all 
subjects of general interest to every educated man, whether he is going into business 
or not; while the study of commercial law in all its ramifications is not inferior, in 
its liberalizing tendencies, to international law or general jurisprudence itself. Such 
a curriculum would prove, therefore, a valuable element in our general scheme of 
education, and would contribute powerfully toward strengthening the hold of our 
public high school system upon the affections and interest of the community, 
HIGHER COMMERCIAL INSTRUCTION IN AUSTRIA. 
HISTORIC REVIEW. 
The history of mercantile instruction in Austria down to the fifties in this century 
stands in a certain relation to the history of the real school. The oldest institution 
which had for its purpose the promotion of instruction in modern subjects was the 
Real-Handlungs-Akademie in Vienna, whose foundation dates back to the reign of 
Empress Maria Theresa, This academy, which was intended to train not merely 
efficient merchants, but also high-class officials for the economic and financial depart- 
ments of the Government, as well as skillful commercial experts, developed in a most 
happy manner. It was well directed and corresponded completely to the wants of 
the time, in which lectures on mercantile subjects were delivered to the law students 
who attended the Theresian and Savoyan academies for nobles. Before the close of 
the year 1770, in which the opening of this institution took place, the Austrian Goy- 
ernment guaranteed a certain support to the institution from the public treasury, 
and enlarged the curriculum to a two years’ course. Theplan of study of thisinsti- 
tution embraced all those subjects which are now taught in commercial schools, and, 
in addition, geometry, mechanics, moral and civillaw, philosophy, and morals. The 
instruction in languages embraced German, French, and Italian.! 
The Real-Handlungs-Akademie, in spite of the promising beginning of its activity, 
did not succeed in maintaining a permanent existence. With the reorganization of 
the entire system of education in Austria, in 1805, it lost its independent position as 
a professional school. Under the name of the Real-Akademie it became the first real 
school of Austria, which had the third and highest grade of elementary instruction, 
in a narrow sense of the term, joined immediately onto the fourth class of the nor- 
mal school. 
The object of this curriculum was the education of youth who intended to devote 
themselves to the higher arts, to trade, to banking, and bookkeeping. The subjects

which are essential for a commercial institution were limited to the last and highest 
class—that of the third year. 2 Z 
This last circumstance rendered very easy the new organization which was given 
to the Vienna Real School in the year 1815, when the Government, following the 
suggestion which Bohemia had given in 1806 by the organization of the first Ger- 
man polytechnic school in Prague, established in that year the Polytechnic School in 
Vienna. The first two years of the real school were converted into a general pre- 
paratory school for the Polytechnic Institute. The third year was extended toa 
second commercial division of technology. This arrangement was based upon the 
correctidea that a merchant needs for his business thorough technological knowledge, 
while the technologist also needs commercial knowledge. Similar commercial 
courses to that in Vienna were organized in the polytechnic institutes of Krakau 
and Lemberg. 
The commercial instruction in the coast lands developed along entirely independent 
lines from the above foundations, which were naturally adapted to theinterests of the 
internal provinces of the Empire. In Trieste a school of navigation had been in 
existence since 1774, when the Austrian and Hungarian coast lines belonged to the 
administrative division of Inner-Austria. In 1811 a division for commerce was added 
to this school; from the institution thus increased was devéloped, in 1842, the pres- 
ent Commercial and Nautical Academy in Trieste. 
The commercial courses in the technical schools, however, did not succeed in obtain- 
ing the hoped-for influence in those circles whose interests they were intended to 
serve, norcould they correspond to the varied demands of the mercantile classes, which 
naturally insisted upon a training suited to their various conditions. In order to 
meet this want, which was naturally felt most keenly in Vienna, the Geyer Com- 
mercial School in 1840, and later the Patzelt, were organized as private undertak- 
ings, and in 1848 the Corporation Commercial School was organized by the corpora- 
tion of Vienna merchants. In the southern portion of the Empire, the private 
commercial school in Laibach is worthy of mention. 
These institutions satisfied the demand down to the middle of the century, but on 
account of the general revolution in political and economic life after the year 1848— 
the development of the railroad and the telegraph, the establishment of great banks 
with foreign capital, etc.—it was a natural consequence that entirely different and 
higher demands were made in the field of commercial education than formerly. 
In order to answer these changed conditions, a lively agitation appeared almost 
contemporaneously in the leading cities of the monarchy for the purpose of estab- 
lishing higher commercial schools by private and public corporations. This led, in 
ashort time, to theestablishment of commercial academies in Prague (German, organ- 
ized in 1856), Vienna (1858), Pesth (1857). Following these new foundations came 
later similar institutions in Gratz (1863), Bohemian Academy in Prague (1872), the 
commercial academies in Linz and Chrudim (18 and Innsbruck (1887). 
The curricula of these higher commercial institutions, among which should be 
included the Commercial and Nautical Academy at Trieste, were no more nearly 
uniform in Austria than were those of similar schools in other European countries. 
The endeavor to secure for the gradnates of such schools the privileges of the one- 
year military service law has led, however, toa gradual assimilation of the curricula 
in these various institutions, with the exception of the .academy at Gratz and the 
higher public course for mercantile instruction at Trieste. 
It may be remarked here that an attempt was made by the law of February 27, 
1873, to regulate the entire field of commercial instruction for that portion of Austria 
below the Enns. <

THE PRINCIPAL COMMERCIAL INSTITUTIONS. 
1—THE COMMERCIAL ACADEMY IN VIENNA. 
A.—Fimst PERIOD (FROM THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ACADEMY DOWN TO 1872). 
Early in the year 1856, B. W. Ohligs, a manufacturer, made a motion in the Cham- 
ber of Commerce and Trades for lower Austria to establish in Vienna a general mer- 
cantile institute. He justified the motion by the exposition of the importance of 
commerce as one of the leading factors of the national economy. While instruction 
for the technical callings was secured, to a certain extent, at least, by various insti- 
tutions of learning, the professional training of the future merchant was on the 
whole neglected. This defective mercantile training was, in his opinion, a chief 
reason why, in spite of the great victories of Austrian industry in international expo- 
sitions, the trade of Austria was limited almost entirely to internal commerce. ‘The 
consulates needed men with mercantile training; the commerce of Austria being 
represented in foreign States by non-Austrian agents and middlemen. The remedy

     must, therefore, be sought in the establishment of commercial institutions which 
“should be organized to answer these demands. 
This suggestion was warmly approved: The proposition by Ohligs was supported 
by Mr. Frederick Schey, Peter Murman, Theodore Hornbostle, E. Seybl, and Edward 
Drasche. The meeting of the founders, held on the 19th of November, 1856, showed 
that there was no longer any doubt of the success of the undertaking. The Govern- 
ment gaye its consent on the 5th of January, 1857, to the formation of an association 
for the establishment of a higher commercial institution in Vienna, and for the open- 
ing of a general subscription. It was largely due to the efforts of Mr. Frederick 
Schey that this association, on the 27th of April, 1857, on the date of its first general 
meeting, showed a membership of 563, with a fund of 352,780 florins, which had been 
subscribed for the purpose mentioned. At this meeting the proposed statutes of the 
association were accepted, and the administrative council chosen. Its first presi- 
dent was Mr. Frederick Schey, who held this position until his death on the 15th of 
July, 1881. The ministry of education approved of the constitution on the 21st of 
October, 1857; the school was opened on the 13th of January, 1858, in a treasury 
building in the Renngasse, in which the ministry of finance had granted the use of 
certain rooms on the 19th of March, 1857. The school opened with 59 pupils, and 
in October,. 1858, it numbered 170 regular pupils, besides the pupils in the evening 
courses, organized for those persons who were engaged in mercantile occupations 
during the day. 
The institution established by the Association of the Vienna Commercial Academy 
has, in the course of time, undergone many changes, but the general body of stat- 
utes of the year 1857 has remained in all essential features unchanged. The Vienna 
Commercial Academy is the creation of aspecial association formed for the purpose, 
and not that of a corporation or of a city like the other commercial academies of 
Austria. 
This association consists, first, of honorary members; second, of founders; that is, 
such persons as pay yearly the sum of 315 florins during their lifetime to the sup- 
port of thé institution, or, at least 3,150 florins in six equal installments; third, of 
associate founders, i.e., such persons as contribute sums less than 3,150 florins and 
exceeding 525 florins; and fourth, of members, i.e., such persons as pay a contribu- 
tion of less than 525 florins, The various classes of members taken together consti- 
tute the general assembly. No member has any special rights, except a founder, 
who has the right to establish a scholarship, and for twenty years thereafter to name 
the holder thereof. 
The general assembly chooses the administrative council, which consists of twelve 
members, of whom six must belong to the class of tradesmen and manufacturers. 
The administrative council chooses from its members a president_and vice-presi- 
dent for the term of one year, who are eligible for reelection indefinitely. The 
administrative council chooses the director and the professors of the institution, as 
well as the subordinate officials and employees. The appointment of the director, pro- 
‘fessors, and other instructors is subject to the approval of the ministry of education. 
The administrative council fixes the amount of tuition, assigns the scholarships, and 
manages the property of the institute. The executive organ of the administrative 
council is the director of the academy. He is intrusted with the scientific and dis- 
ciplinary management of the institution; he is responsible to the administrative 
council accerding to the existing general rules and regulations of the association. 
The public spirit of Vienna citizens had established the commercial academy. It 
was of special importance for its further development that the administrative coun- 
cil succeeded in obtaining as director Mr. Franz Hauke, who, a few years before, had 
been prominently connected with the establishment of the first superior real schools 
in Austria. In constructing the curriculum of the institution great difficulties were 
to be overcome. For one could not, as in the case of the gymnasium, draw upon the 
experience of centuries in constructing its curriculum. Ohligs had sketched out 
the first curriculum for a higher commercial institution with a three years’ course. 
This plan was made the basis of the programme of the institution on the 16th of 
January, 1857, and will probably continue to form in its comprehensive scope the 
ideal of the school. The underlying thought of the three-class commercial institute 
was retained in the curriculum worked out later, but various cireumstances com- 
pelled the administrative council to make a division in the institution which was, 
according to the original plan, to have been organized asaunit. The council estab- 
lished four classes, of which the first two were preparatory, while the last two were 
to form the real academy. This organization was in so far advantageous as the 
pupils who had not completed the studies prescribed for the academy courses (i. e., 
the completion of the six-form real schools or the first six classes of the gymnasium) 
could obtain the desired preliminary preparation in the preparatory schools, as had 
been the custom for decades in technical schools. This organization of the commer- 
cial academy remained in force from 1858 to 1872, and characterizes the first period 
of the history of the institution.

  The Vienna Commercial Academy, as was proper for a professional school, always 
sought to maintain an intimate connection with practical life, which is evidenced 
by the regular visits made by the pupils, under the direction of their instructors, to 
public collections, industrial establishments, and to the great commercial centers of 
the Orient. As might have been expected, in spite of the high tuition, 150 florins a 
year, with incidental fees of 5 florins, the attendance at the institution steadily 
increased. Pupils came not only from Vienna, but from all parts of the monarchy 
belonging to the commercial district of Vienna, especially from Hungary, Galicia, 
and Moravia. Pupils who had completed this course found employment very easily. 
The Government recognized also the high character of the school on the 22d of Feb- 
ruary, 1868, by granting to the graduates of the school the privileges of the one- 
year military service. 
The opening of its own building on the 12th of October, 1862, was an external sign 
of the prosperity of the institution. In order to cover the cost of this building a 
second subscription was opened by the association in 1869, with gratifying results. 
The other obligations of the school were met from 1871 on from the surplus which 
the regular income showed over the regular expenditure. 
Encouraged by these favorable circumstances, the management next considered 
plans involving the enlargement of the programme of the school, but these were not 
carried out until, upon the death of the first director, Franz Hauke, on the 2d of 
July, 1871, Alois Czedik, of Brundelsberg, was elected director of the academy. 
B.—SECOND PERIOD (1872 TO 1877). 
In this old organization the Vienna Commercial Academy had served especially 
the wants of those people looking toward bank although the gradual extension 
of instruction in natural science showed that the wants of merchants were not 
   
-P-A-G-E-805
    COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 729 
neglected. Whoever wished to prepare himself for work in transportation or insur- 
ance was obliged to have recourse to other schools existing at that time in Vienna, 
supported either by the Government or by various corporations or companies, 
Following the suggestion of the management of the academy, the railway com- 
panies closed their schools for applicants for positions in the railway service, and 
the royal ministry of commerce its courses for telegraphic operators, At the same 
time, in combination with the insurance companies, they offered to the academy 
large grants of money for the period of six years, in return for which, in the year 
1872, the academy opened courses for railway service, postal service, telegraph serv- 
ice, and insurance. The curricula were worked out in consultation with the con- 
tributing parties; the railroad companies declared those who had completed such a 
course to be prepared for admission into the corresponding branch of the service. 
The problem now was to connect this new course with that of the old academy, 
which on its part needed some reform. For in the course of time the preparatory ~ 
classes, which had practically become a two-form intermediate school, were not at 
all in a position to compete on equal terms with the three-form real school, or with 
the four-form superior gymnasium. 
The general assembly, therefore, on the 29th day of May, 1872, upon proposal of 
the Administrative Council, ordered the reorganization of the Vienna Commercial 
Academy. In the place of the former unified school, two institutions were now 
organized, each with its own management and its own body of instructors. The 
two preparatory years and the first year of the academy were combined into a three- 
year commercial intermediate school. The second year of the academy and the sepa- 
rate courses mentioned above were combined into a new commercial institution, 
called later the ‘‘ Commercial High School.” 
A similar organization of the higher mercantile instruction was decreed for Austria 
below the Enns by the law of the 27th of F ‘ebruary, 1873. 
The establishment of the Commercial Intermediate School was approved on the 
28th of June, 1872, by the ministry of religion and instruction. The institution 
received the name “ Academic,” and was opened in October of that year. As a con- 
dition of admission to this institution the completion of the lower gymnasium or the 
lower real school was required. Whoever had not completed these studies at a 
recognized school was allowed to take an examination upon the subject-matter, 
provided he had completed his fourteenth year. On the next page is given the cur- 
riculum of the Academic Commercial Intermediate School for the year 1876.

The chief distinction between this curriculum and that of the former academy is 
to be found in the fact that in the new institution the learning of two foreign lan- 
guages was required, in such a way that all the pupils were required to study French, 
and to choose either English or Italian in addition. From this time on, instruetion 
in the foreign languages \ was given consecutively by classes. 
The final “organization of the higher division was effected after a one year’s trial, 
1872-73, on the basis of the ‘organic statute,” which was modeled after that of the 
technical high schools of Austria, and was approved by the ministry of education on 
the 28th of July, 1873. This new institution bore the name Commercial High School. 
A curator was ‘appointed as the representative of the administrative council, whose

  Herr 
Czedik was appointed to this position, which he held during the entire existence of 
this school. 
in the body The immediate direction and government of the institution was vested 
of professors, who elected each year from their midst a rector, such elec- 
tion being subject to the approval of the administrative council and the tatification 
of the ministry of religion and instruction. 
The Commercial High School was divided into three di 
    ions: The first, for bank- 
ing (including insurance and mortgage banks) ; the second, merchandising (includ- 
ing express shipping and manufacturing), and the third, for transportation (including 
railways, post, and telegraph). 
Four semesters were required to complete the course of the Commercial High 
School. The principle of freedom of study and freedom of teaching was established. 
A distinction was made between the regular and 
accepted as regular students who presented a cer     ecial students. Only those were 
cate of graduation from an inter- 
mediate school, or who could pass an examination upon an equivalent course (though 
this latter prov 
dents were permitted to pa: 
    ion was limited to the duration of three years), and only those stu- 
this examination who had completed their eighteenth 
year. Whoever could not fulfill these conditions might be enrolled as a special stu- 
dent, if he were at least 18 years of age. Most of the pupils in the railway, postal 
and telegraph courses were special students. Such students did not receive certi: 
cates of graduation, but merely certificates of attendance. 
    
‘The examinations of the regular students were divided into term examinations at 
the end of each semester, and final examinations, of a severe character, for those 
who had completed four semesters in the Commercial High School. Those students 
who had passed the severe examinations in all subjects. of the respective courses 
received a diploma, 
Those pupils in the transportation courses who were preparing themselves for 
railway, postal, and telegraph service were allowed to pass special examinations 
before special examining commissions appointed by the ministry of commerce and 
the Austrian railway managements, who contributed to the support of these courses.

These two institutions of the Association of the Vienna Commercial Academy 
existed, however, only for a short time—the intermediate school for five years, the 
high school for four. The serious results of the financial crisis which occurred in 
May, 1873, and the circumstance that the Government and the contributing private 
companies, after the close of the first period, withdrew their grants of aid, compelled 
the management of the Vienna Commercial Academy to undertake a reorganization 
of the institution. The Commercial High School, in which for each of the leading 
subjects two men had been appointed, had been organized on too great a scale for 
existing conditions. On the other hand, the feeling grew steadily in the commercial 
world that the Academic Commercial Intermediate School was a purely intermediate 
school of a general character, and not a professional school, because it formed only 
a preparation for admission into the Commercial High School, and on this account 
limited the commercial subjects in its courses toaminimum. The public was, more- 
over, opposed to a five-year course of instruction as being too long, and the graduates 
of the intermediate school entered the high school only in very small numbers. The 
consequence was the reorganization of the high school and the intermediate school. 
The first step taken was the reorganization of the Commercial Intermediate School, 
and the making of it, in accordance with the wishes of the classes whose interests it 
was to serve, a real professional school, while from purely financial considerations 
the place of the Commercial High School was taken by a separate course of one year 
for those young men who were over 17 years of age, and who could show evidence of 
an adequate liberal training. Both institutions were again put under the manage- 
ment of the same director, thus establishing a unified control and management. As 
the position of curator was given up with the discontinuance of the high school, the 
instructing body was again made the same for both institutions. These changes were 
accepted in the general assembly on the 25th of June, 1877, and were approved later 
by the ministry of religion and instruction.

The third and latest period of the existence of the Vienna Commercial Academy 
coincides with the presidency of the privy councilor, Dr. Rudolph Sonndorfer, who 
had been a professor in the Commercial High School, and was at the same time for 
the year 1876-77 director of the intermediate school. In this double position he laid 
the plans for the reorganization of the institution and carried them out with the 
beginning of the school year of 1877-78. t 
In the following pages is given a view of the development and organization of the 
institution during this period, taking up each division separately. 
| 
A. THE ACADEMY WITH A THREE-YEAR COURSE. 
The object of the three-form academy is the acquisition of a higher commercial 
training, with due regard to those subjects of a general education, acquaintance with 
which may be fairly demanded of every merchant. It is, therefore, not an interme- 
diate school which prepares for a high school, but is itself a technical school, which 
turns out its students furnished with a theoretical training directly into practical life. 
Those students are admitted who have completed the first four classes of a gymna- 
sium, or of areal school. Such pupils, after completing the courses of the Commer- 
cial Academy, enjoy the privileges of the one-year military service law. 
Those persons who can not present certificates covering the courses of study 
described above, but have at least completed the common schools and are 14 years of 
age, are admitted to an entrance examination, in which they must show a range of 
knowledge corresponding to the courses of study in the institutions mentioned above. 
The number of those pupils who are admitted on the basis of the entrance examina- 
tion is steadily decreasing.! 
The yearly tuition in this department, as in the graduate department,? is 160 florins, 
the matriculation fee 3 florins, There are, however, many scholarships and remis- 
sions of tuition, which make attendance at the school possible for poor pupils, and 
therefore open to them the opportunity of entering a mercantile career. 
Owing to the age of the pupils and the object of the school, namely, to train effi- 
cient merchants, the most rigorous discipline is enforced in the three-form academy. 
For the same reason the system of final examinations was given up, which was char- 
acteristic of the former academy, and the pupils are now examined throughout the 
entire year. ‘To carry out this idea more fully, reports are prepared by which the 
families of the pupils are kept in continuous knowledge of their school work. 
Corresponding to the purposes of the school, the subjects of instruction are di- 
vided into two groups, the professional subjects and the liberal subjects, between 
which foreign languages form a certain union, as they are learned chiefly for the 
purpose of mercantile correspondence. The curriculum of the new academy shows, 
in comparison with that of the old one, a very decided advance, in that it has not 
merely the training of young people for banking in view, but, owing to the changed 
conditions of the times, it has in view, to a far greater extent than formerly, the 
wants of those who expect to enter merchandising, chemistry, and chemical tech- 
nology. The study of commercial products and chemical technology are taught in 
the new as they were in the old academy. 
The application of the knowledge thus acquired to the demands of business life 
is, however, first made possible by the knowledge of mercantile usage and the study 
of products, because in this way the knowledge of the basis of commerce, namely, 
the classification of goods, freight rates, etc., is first brought home to the student. 
This subject completes in a certain way the instruction for merchandising. It was 
introduced into the high school by Dr. Sonndorfer, and was retained in the three- 
form academy. In the year 1880-81 tariff legislation and administration was also 
introduced.as an elective branch of study. The development of instruction in the 
knowledge of commercial products will be discussed more fully later. 
In the table on page 738 the number and distribution of the subjects of instruc- 
tion are given. Details will be found in the catalogue of the academy. It should 
be mentioned further that for those pupils of the first class that have completed the 
lower gymnasium, and therefore, as a rule, have no knowledge of French, a separate 
course in French has been organized, attendance at which, however, is not required 
of the pupils. 
That the organization of the year 1877 corresponds to the wants of the commer- 
cial world, and gives guaranty that the pupils who graduate possess the necessary 
      
  
1In the school year 1877-78, of 149 pupils who were admitted to the first year’s course only 47 per cent had completed the required preliminary studies in a recognized school. In the year 1887-88, on the 
contrary, of 232 admitted to the first year’s course 209, or 90 per cent, had completed the required studies in such a school. 2 Compare the organization of the same on page 733.     
   
   
-P-A-G-E-809
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 733 
general education, is shown by the continued and growing approval which the reor- 
ganization of the Commercial Academy has received from the public. 
The details concerning the various relations of the pupils are given on pages 745 
and 746. It appears from them that the pupils in the three-form academy come 
mostly from Vienna and lower Austria; they come in considerable numbers from 
Hungary, Moravia, Silesia, Bohemia, and Galicia. Foreign countries send from 
twenty-five to forty pupils. It is plain, therefore, that the three-form academy is not 
by any means of merely localimportance. Theinstitution receivesfrom Hungary and 
the States along the lower Danube a considerable number of pupils, who are, how- 
ever, often defective in preliminary training. As it lies in the interest of the com- 
merce of the Monarchy, and especially of Vienna, that these elements should be 
attracted, the academy established some years ago a special preparatory class in 
which such young people have an opportunity to make good the defects of their 
training, and especially to learn the German language. The number of hours has 
been fixed at twenty-eight per week,! 
Special importance is given in the curriculum to instruction in German, French, 
and mathematics. Besides these subjects, geography, history, physics, natural his- 
tory, and penmanship are taught. The instruction is given with reference to the 
purpose of the professional school which the young people intend to enter in the 
following year. The entrance examination for the first class of the academy is held 
at the end of the school year. 
B. ONE-YEAR COURSE FOR THE GRADUATES OF THE GYMNASIA AND REAL SCHOOLS, 
This course has developed from a small beginning into an institution which 
answers the demands of wide circles. It was intended originally for such youths as 
were at least 17 years of age and had pursued an extended course of liberal train- 
ing. At present it performs the functions of enabling those young men who, after 
graduation from the gymnasia or real schools, wish to pursue commercial studies to 
complete the course in these branches within one school year. All the subjects of 
study are prescribed. 
In order to insure success in the prosecution of the studies, attendance at the 
exercises is insisted upon. At the end of the year examinations are held, which 
every pupil must attend who wishes to obtain a certificate. Certificates of mere 
attendance are not given. Only those pupils are admitted to these examinations 
who have attended during the entire school year all the prescribed recitations. The 
programme of studies is given below. It will be noted that each pupil is required 
to learn one foreign language, and to pass an examination upon it at the end of the 
year. 
This graduate course gets, as a rule, most of its pupils from Hungary; then come 
Vienna, Moravia, Silesia, Galicia, and Bohemia, In some years, however, Vienna 
and lower Austria have stood third and fourth in the list. It is notable that between 
40 and 48 per cent of the pupils are of non-German birth. This fact illustrates the 
position of this graduate course in the general scheme of commercial instruction in 
the Monarchy, and shows that the idea underlying this course is a very fruitful one 
for very many different classes.

SyYNoPsiIs OF CURRICULUM IN THE ONE AND THREE YEAR CoursEs IN THE VIENNA

       A.— ONE-YEAR COURS 
Political economy.—In the lectures on this subject the object kept in view is 
acquaint the student, in a manner corresponding to his thorough preparation, with 
the laws of wealth, and especially with the influence of the same on industry and 
commerce. The most important facts of the history of political economy and its 
doctrines are discussed, and special weight is laid on the relation of these facts to 
contemporaneous events in the world’s history. Following this, the fundamental 
principles of the production, exchange, distribution, and consumption of goods are 
explained, and the manifestations of these laws in political economy. This is done 
in accordance with the object of the school, viz, special attention is given to those 
subjects which belong to commerce and industry; in particular, the money standard, 
stocks and bonds, banking, transportation, the railroad question, and, finally, the 
tariff question. 
This course of lectures is closed by a discussion of commercial crises, their causes 
and phenomena, 
    
COMMERCIAL LAW, LAWS OF BILLS OF EXCHANGE, AND LAWS RELATING TO TRADE. 
When it is desired to give students a special legal training, who do not possess 
any previous general knowledge of jurisprudence, one must continually strive to 
show how the law to bo discussed and its precepts are the results of the needs of 
life and trade, in order to awaken a lively interest in the subject and to make pos- 
sible a correct understanding of legal decisions. 
The lectures begin with the regulations relating to bills of exchange, because 
these form a complete whole, and are acknowledged to be a masterpiece of legisla- 
tion, and consequently rapidly familiarize the students with legal forms and terms. 
A preliminary study of the fundamental principles of the history of bills of exehange 
and of laws relating to them, and also the management of institutions for dealing in 
bills of exchange, is followed by an explanation of the separate laws with special 
regard to the needs of practical life. 
After this is studied, in the same manner general commercial law, in the course of 
which reference is made to those parts of the general civil law which are of interest 
in this connection, as well as to those parts of commercial law and usage which are 
not yet codified. This course is closed by a short description of the principal Jaws 
in force relating to trades and industries. 
Commercial geography and statistics. —Commercial geography considers the earth as 
an economic unit and the single States as economic factors in the great organism of 
the world’s economy. It shows how production, industry, commerce, and trade of 
the separate peoples develop themselves on the basis of geographical, ethnograph- 
ical, and geological conditions. 
In the lectures on commercial geography and statistics, the European countries, 
as also the most important countries outside of Europe, are thoroughly treated in a 
manner based on the advanced preliminary preparation enjoyed by the students.

PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN THE LABORATORY FOR STUDY OF PRODUCTS. 
Training in the use of the microscope.—Microscopical tests are thoroughly carried 
out for determining raw material and manufactures. The material for these micro- 
scopical examinations is taken from the collection of products and from objects sent 
to the school by merchants. To aid in the lectures, demonstrations, and practical 
exercises there are a special laboratory for the study of goods, with a sample collec- 
es for direct use during the teaching, a museum of merchandise, and a professional 
‘ibrary.

computing the premium, the reserve, redemption, loans, policies, and reductions. 
The insurance business in its practical workings, closing accounts (profit, loss, and 
balance accounts). 
THE FRENCH LANGUAGE. 
As a large number of students when they enter the school possess an adequate 
preparation in French, the instruction in this language is divided into two courses, 
viz: In the first course the instruction is given in German, and in the second course 
the instruction is given in French, 
First course.—This course presupposes none, or only very little, preliminary knowl- 
edge of French. Consequently the instruction begins with the pronunciation, and 
along with this the elements of etymology are explained and by a series of carefully 
selected examples the pronunciation and etymology are practiced. 
In the second semester the construction of sentences in general and the most 
important parts of syntax are treated, and in this work continued oral and written 
practice is required. For practice in correct writing and in order to familiarize the 
students with the most important commercial expressions, mercantile letters are dic- 
tated in French. These are discussed, corrected, and translated into correct French; 
special weight is laid on rapid translations from French into German. 
s EEE ROCES Dr. Filek Edler vy. Wittinghausen, Elementarbuch der franzésischen

TSeoond course.—Extending and supplementing the syntactical knowledge. Brief 
review of the entire grammar, entirely in French; at the same time written exercises, 
which, through their methodical and graded arrangement as well as through their 
number and variety, are most suitable to familiarize the students with the ordinary 
forms of the language. Translation of classical selections from French into German 
and vice versa, with special regard to the different moods of both languages. Con- 
tinual translating of German letters into French, paying careful attention to the differ- 
ence in the commercial expressions; composition of business letters and somewhat 
long, independent exercises in French. Every week reading in French from the 
market and exchange reports. 
Text-book: Bechtel and Hertzog, Franzésische Conversations grammatik fiir 
commercielle Lehranstalten. 
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 
The instruction begins—as the students are presupposed to have no preliminary 
knowledge of the subject whatever—with the very rudiments of the language, viz, 
with the explanation of Walker’s phonetic signs, in order that the students may be 
able to read even before they have systematically learned the rules of orthoepy. 
Following this there is given a concise statement of the grammatical rules which 
are practically applied by means of the selections for reading and translating given 
in Part I of the text-book. In this manner the students acquire, even in the first 
semester, a complete survey of the entire etymology, together with an elementary 
knowledge of the grammar and syntax, as well as a large number of the ordinary 
forms of expression. They also acquire no inconsiderable rapidity in reading and 
translating. 
In the second semester Part II of the text-book is begun. At first the most impor- 
tant rules for reading are explained, and this is followed by a thorough treatment 
of the grammar and syntax, which are methodically subdivided for this purpose: 
In connection therewith, these theories are applied to the selections for reading and 
 
-P-A-G-E-813

translating. These selections treat almost exclusively of economic or commercial 
subjects, now in separate sentences, now in longer, connected selections in which the 
perminalogy. used in business intercourse and commercial correspondence predomi- 
nates, 
This part of the instruction occupies two hours a week, while a third hour is 
devoted to reading some English work written in a modern conversational style. 
The above course sufficiently prepares the student in this subject for tho first 
requirements of a business calling, and at the same time the directions given place 
him in a position that by means of further self-activity he can acquire complete 
knowledge of the language. 
Text-book: H. Berger, “Lehrbuch der englischen Sprache.” 
THE ITALIAN LANGUAGE. 
As the students are supposed to have absolutely no knowledge of the Italian 
language, the instruction begins with the elementary rules of pronunciation and 
grammar. 
The first month is devoted to written exercises in the synonyms and derived words, 
by means of which the students acquire a vocabulary. Following this the text of 
the elementary grammar is taken up. In conjunction with the above, the regular 
and irregular verbs are begun, so that by the close of the school year the student is 
perfectly conversant with the most important verbs of the language. 
All the fundamental rules of the Italian language are thoroughly studied, and 
practically applied in translating suitable selections from the German into the Ital- 
jan, and vice versa. In this, special attention is paid to the Italian syntax. The 
syntax itself is treated in a special discussion and illustrated by means of classical 
selections from the Italian language, committed to memory. From this time on the 
students attempt to express their thoughts orally in the Italian language, paying 
special attention to the language of ordinary conversation, commercial terms, and. 
ae most important business correspondence—letters about exchange and letters of 
advice. 
In addition to all this it is never neglected to specify to the students books of 
assistance and a suitable method to pursue which will enable them successfully to 
continue their studies in the Italian language without assistance. 
Austrian regulations in regard to the customs and State monopolies and details of cus- 
toms administrations.—The bases of the lectures are: 
(a) Austrian regulations with regard to customs and State monopolies, especially 
those requirements which must be observed in import and export trade with foreign 
countries. - 
(b) The general Austro-Hungarian customs tariff and the legal requirements which 
it is necessary to observe in applying the tariff. 
(c) Special directions about giving credit at the custom-house, refunding duties, 
liability; authority over the details of customs administration. 
(d) Directions in regard to dutiable commerce on railroads, steamboats, and the 
railway postal system. 
(e) The form of bills of entry, as well as the legal punishments for false declarations. 
(f) The commercial and customs treaties, which are made between Austria-Hun- 
gary and foreign countries, and which are of special advantage to industry and 
commerce.

   B.—THREE YEARS’ COURSE. 
FOR PUPILS WHO HAVE FINISHED THE COURSE IN THE LOWER GYMNASIUM, THE 
REAL GYMNASIUM, OR THE LOWER REAL SCHOOL, 
    The three-year course of the Vienna Commercial Academy, as noted above, has for 
its object to guarantee to the students (graduates of lower gymnasium, real gymna- 
sium, or lower real school) who wish to devote themselves to a commercial career, 
that higher commercial professional education, with specialattention to general edu- 
cational subjects, which to-day can be rightfully demanded of every merchant.. The 
academy has a three-year course of study, and each year’s class is divided into par- 
allel divisions according to the number of students. The students receive a cer- 
tificate for each year completed, and when they have finished the course they have the 
privilege of the one-year voluntary-service law.

C.—PREPARATORY OLASS. 
In order to make it possible for those pupils to attend the academy who have not 
taken the studies required for entrance to the three years’ course, the imperial min- 
istry for religion and instruction has permitted a preparatory class to be organized 
in connection with the Commercial Academy, which has, however, the character of 
a private course. According to the decreo of the i imperial mi stry for religion and 
instruction of July, 1877 (Z. 10194), every pupil who has passed his thirteenth birth-

day may be admitted to this preparatory class, if the managers of the Commercial 
Academy find him to be properly qualified. 
The pupils of the preparatory class receive no certificate, but at the close of the 
second semester they must pass the examination required for entrance to the first 
year’s course of the Commercial Academy. The pupils receive from the managers of 
the academy a statement of the result of this examination.

Jollection of coins.—This collection was begun upon the initiative of the present 
director, and contains all the current coins, domestic and foreign, arranged by States. 
It is a great aid to instruction in mercantile subjects. 
Physical laboratory.—Instruétion in physics is given in a special room assigned for 
this purpose. The apparatus belonging to the physical laboratory has cost, up to 
the present, over 6,000 florins, and includes the most necessary instruments for pur- 
poses of experimentation and illustration. 
ul laboratory.—Chemistry and the knowledge of commercial products open 
to the pupils an understanding of the technico-commercial branches. On this 
account great emphasis has been laid on this study from the beginning of the acad- 
emy, owing to its relation to the manufacturing classes. The chemical laboratory 
has been several times enlarged, and includes not only lecture rooms, but also several 
ng rooms, which have all the equipment nec: for accurate organic analy- 
es. Tho li boratory has a large special library a darich collection of preparations 
and apparatus which are used for illustration in the lectures. It not only affords the    
        
        
             
 
-P-A-G-E-820
  744. 3 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. . 
pupils means for practical work, but also an opportunity to the director of the labora- 
tory for original investigation in every direction. The practical exercises are 
attended yearly by from 20 to 25 pupils. 
The origin of the collection of commercial products dates from the first years of 
the academy. There was also a natural-histery collection corresponding the 
wants of the preparatory classes of that period. Both collections were saa 
increased, but remained entirely separate until instruction in these two departments 
- was intrusted to the same professor, when the collections were united. The instruc- 
tion in commercial products was greatly expanded by the introduction of practical 
exercises. These exercises are attended by pupils of all three classes and of the 
graduate course also. They take place in a special laboratory for the testing of 
commercial products, which is well equipped with the necessary apparatus, includ- 
ing microscopes, saccharometers, etc. 
The combined collections for natural history and commercial products are divided 
into three groups: The collections for instruction in natural history and commercial 
products; second, the collection for practicai work in the commercial-product 
laboratory (reports are made each year from these practical exercises), and, third, 
the museum of products. 
This museum was begun at the initiative of the present director in the year 1885. 
It is located in the large hall, second story front, and in the room immediately con- 
nected withit, Theimuseum has a double purpose: To aid instruction in commercial 
products in the academy and to promote a general knowledge of such products in 
the public at large. The collection is therefore open not only to pupils, but also to 
the general public. The specialty of this museum is the collection of adulterations 
of products, and it is not impossible that a considerable influence may be exercised 
from this laboratory upon the trade in adulterated products. The museum of prod- 
ucts embraces about 4,000 numbers and 30 groups. For the completion of the same 
the administrative council has given 1,000 florins a year for the past three years. 
It is also to be noted that in the programme of instruction in the knowledge of 
commercial products belongs a system of visits to collections and factories, which 
the pupils make under the guidance of instructors. All the pupils of the academy 
take partin those excursions which occur in Vienna, but in the long trip which is 
made each year at Easter time, and which extended in 1887 to Strasburg, a limited 
number of pupils only can be included. 
Geographical cabinet ‘his cabinet is one of the most comprehensive in this special 
department. It includes170 wall maps and a large collection of casts and representa- 
tions of geographical and ethnographical objects. 
Collection to illustrate the history of art.—This collection has just been begun; its 
function is to supplement instruction in history and the history of literature, in order 
to compensate as far as possible for the rather meager number of hours assigned to 
these subjects in the programme. 
Library.—The collection of books at the Vienna Commercial Academy embraced, 
at the close of the school year 1886-87, 5,298 volumes. It is divided into two divisions, 
the professional library for the pupils and the general library. The lattér includes 
important collections used as reference libraries in the individual departments of 
instruction. The professional library for pupils was established in order to give 
them the necessary aids for further study and for the essays which they must pre- 
pare. All works of merely an amusing or entertaining character are excluded from 
this collection. 
The traveling scholarship fund,—The intermediate school has completed its fanction 
at the time when it gives the graduate his final certificate. But the professional 
school can not avoid extending its work beyond this period and serving as an organ 
of communication between the young men who have completed its curriculum and 
those people who desire young men with such training. In this respect the Vienna 
Commercial Academy has from the beginning done everything it could, and it has 
been in the happy situation of being able to secure for its graduates g good positions 
not only at home but also abroad. This last circumstance is of great ‘Importance to 
the foreign commerce of our country. Ever since the days of Maria Theresa com- 
plaints have been made continually that the monarchy has had very few national 
commercial houses in foreign countries, and yet these are the chief means of enlarg- 
ing the economic territory of the State. To obtain these, however, it is absolutely 
necessary that the citizens of the country enter business in foreign ports and thus 
learn to know foreign countries thoroughly. Now, there are probably many young 
men who possess the necessary training, but oftentimes they are not in the’ place 
where they are most necessary, and still oftener are not in a social position to learn 
commercial centers in every datail and to exercise an active influence in favor of the 
national trade. 
In order to assist young merchants who have had a certain practical experience to 
make a careful study of foreign centers of trade, the present director of the academy 
proposed in a general assembly of the association of the Vienna Commercial Academy, 
             
-P-A-G-E-821
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. TAS 
held on December 8, 1885, the establishment of a special traveling scholarship fund. 
This proposition was received with warm approval. His} sty” the Emperor gave 
the first subscription of 5,000 florins to this fund. His mple was followed by 
Prince John of Lichtenstein.and a number of prominent merchants and manufac- 
turers and various commercial institutes. The director succeeded in raising for this 
purpose the sum of 60,000 florins, The list of the various subscribers and the Tegu- 
lations for the scholarships are to be found in the report of the proceedings of ‘the 
administrative council, made December 12, 1886. In April, 1887, the administrative 
council decided to assign two scholarships of the value of a 500 florins each, one to 
Salonichi and one for Barcelona. In September, 1887, both were assigned. The con- 
ditions of these scholarships are completion of the Vienna Commercial Academy with 
distinction and at least three years’ successful practical work at home and abroad. 
Itremains now, in order to complete this account, to give some of the more important 
data relating to the school. The total attendance at the Vienna Commercial Academy, 
since its establishment in 1858 to the year 1888, inclusive, was 16,906 students. Tt is 
of interest to note how many students have completed the course of study and obtained. 
the certificate of graduation. It appears that in the first period, 1858 to 1872, there 
were 1,714 graduates; second period, 1873 to 1877, there were 1,262 graduates; third 
period, 1878 to 1888, there were 2,168 graduates, making a total of 5 5,144 in the thirty 
years of the life of the academy. The success of the instruction has been avery satis- 
factory one, and in this connection it is important to note that the report of the 
management to the ministry of education, rendered each year since the beginning 
of the third period, has been uniformly accepted as eminently satisfactory. 
The graduates of the academy have always foundemployment very quickly, whether 
at home or abroad. Former students of the academy are to be found in all the larger 
centers of trade in Germany, Switzerland, France, England, and Belgium, as w ell as 
in the leading States of North and South America. At the present time there are 
forty foundations or scholarships established by the founders in accordance with the 
provision noted above. There is one Imperial scholarship of a yearly value of 300 
florins, and two scholarships named after Czedik of 126 florins each. The assistance 
fund, established for worthy poor students, amounted on June 15, 1887, to 7,061.73 
florins, and aid was granted in the school year 1887, in cash, to the extent of 683.11 
florins; in paper, pencils, etc., to the extent of 246 florins; in text-books, to the extent 
of 290.63 florins; in traveling expenses, to the extent of 370 florins. The students 
contributed to this fund 920.25 florins. The president of the society for assisting 
poor students, which has charge of the fund, is the director of the academy ex officio. 
The executive committee consists of two professors, chosen by the instructing body, 
and a general committee of two from each division, chosen by the students. 
The association of the Vienna Commercial Academy had received, from its founda- 
tion up to 1887, from its members, contributions to the amount of 530,64: 22 florins; 
of this amount the State granted 40,950 florins, the city of Vienna 31,500 florins. 
The State made its appropriation in the form of establishing, through the ministry 
of religion and instruction and the ministry of finance, one scholarship (3,150 flor: ins) 
a year for a series of years. In consequence, the ministry for religion and instruction 
controls at present seven scholarships and the ministry of finance six. 
Of this amount, 452,110.15 florins were used for the purchase of the ground and the 
erection of the building of the academy, and to cover the deficit of the early years, 
including also 27,000 florins assigned to ‘the pension fund established in 1873. The 
rest of the sum constitutes the “academy fund, which, according to the balance of 
August 31, 1886, amounted to 159,693.80 florins. i 
The current expenses of the academy since its establishment amount to nearly 
2,000,000 florins and was covered entirely by the tuition of pupils. The income of 
the institution from tuition and incidental fees from 1878 to 1887 amounted to nearly 
900,000 florins. 
The administrative council of the Vienna Commercial Academy has, however, uni- 
formly observed the principle that the worthy pupil, though poor, should be enabled 
to attend this school. It grants, therefore, every school year to a considerable num- 
ber of pupils either entire or partial remission of tuition. These remissions repre- 
sented down to August 31, 1887, the considerable sum of 280,485 florins. 
The preliminary budget for the year 1886 showed the following estimate:

The Vienna Commercial Academy possesses, since 1873, its own pension fund, 
is managed by a separate committee. To this fund the regularly appointed p na toe 
sors contribute the samo rates as in the case of public educ ational institutions, as the 
provisions adopted by the State for similar pensions have been accepted as the rule 
for this fund. Besides this, the general assembly grants yearly a very considerablo 
sum to this fund from its surplus income. On Angust 31, 1886, this fund amounted 
to 144,314.46 florins, and the pensions payable amounted to 4,074.96 florins. In the 
gencral assembly of December 12, 1886, 5,000 florins were granted to this fund. 
The Vienna Commercial Academy is located in its own building, which was form- 
ally opened on tho 12th of October, 1862. It embraces an area of 1,953 square met: 
Its principal front is 60 meters long; its two side fronts 31 meters each. The build- 
ing is two stories high. It cost, as noted above, 452,110.15 florins. As divided at 
present, it embraces 15 lecture rooms, the museum of commercial products, the lab- 
oratories for chemistry and commercial products, the physical, geographical, and 
natural history 1s, 2 libraries, 2 faculty rooms, the office of the management and 
various small offices, and the residence of the director and 3 servants, and has accom- 
modation for 800 students. The arrangements for heat are so fixed that the vesti- 
bules, the great stairway, and the large corridors are warmed throughout. Water 
is also furnished throughout the buildin The heating costs per year from 1,400 to 
1,500 florins; gas from 1,600 to 1,700 florins. 
We might finally mention that the Vienna Commercial Academy has the largest 
attendance of similar commercial schools in Austria, Germany, and France, and that 
of late years the management has been repeatedly requested to give detailed infor- 
mation to foreign governments as to the arrangements and 
school. The school also received the highest distinction at the Vienna World’s F 
in the year 1873.

be of interest in this connection. 
Tho one-year course for graduates of the gymnasia and real schools had an enroll- 
ment in 1889 of 115 pupils; in 1890, of 105 pupils; and in 1891, of 115 pupils.

2.—COMMERCIAL ACADEMY OF PRAGUE. 
The foundation of the institution..—It is a strange fact that the very class which 
occupies to-day by its activity and wealth the most prominent place in our society has 
been neglected almost altogether-by the governments of the various States in regard 
to the professional training of its members. There are gymnasia for the training of 
the future scholar and public official, and real schools and polytechnic institutions 
for the technologist. The forester, the miner, the soldier, the sailor, all have their 
own technical schools, but the future merchant has had to content himself with the 
gymnasium or the real school. Was the reason for this to be found in the fact that 
the merchant needs no special preliminary training for his calling? That the special 
branches of knowledge appropriate to his vocation are really only facilities which 
the school is not able to give him; things of subordinate importance which he can 
easily acquire for himself by private activity and practical work? It would almost 
seem so; and it may be that this view was not unjustifiable in earlier times, but the 
present makes new demands upon the merchant if he wishes to rise above the lim- 
ited sphere of the small shopkeeper. He needs a greater amount of training and 
knowledge if he is to keep pace with the times and to occupy that place in social 
and economic life to which he is entitled. But where shall he obtain this training? 
There is no doubt that existing educational institutions are not adequate to supply 
this want. Thesolid training of the gymnasium has its great adyantages, and many 
a merchant of to-day selects his assistants rather from the ranks of the graduates of 
the gymnasium than from those of the real schools. But the gymnasium can not, of 
course, insert the purely commercial branches of instruction into its curriculum, and 
consequently it does not appear to be at all satisfactory as a preparatory school for the 
commercial career. The real schools would seem to be somewhat nearer, but these 
schools furnished a training more suitable for the manufacturer and the technologist 
than forthe merchant, and until very lately, especially in Austria, they excluded from 
these schools the important element of modern languages. The purely commercial 
branches also are either very inadequately or are not at all represented in their cur- 
riculum. The attempt has been made here and there to unite special commercial 
courses with the real schools. But this is only piecework, and can be justified only 
where it is impossible to establish independent commercial schools. For the place 
of the professional school can not be even approximately supplied in this way. 
At the time when the thought of the establishment of the commercial school 
appeared for the first time in Prague the various public educational institutions 
were far less perfect than to-day. The unsatisfactory condition of things had been 
recognized first in Germany, and it was the Leipzig Merchant Guild which took the 
first step toward the remedy. Itestablished in the year 1831 a commercial institute, 
whose organization by Schiebe remained for a long time in a certain sense the model 
for the similar establishments organized later throughout central Germany. 
About the same time the need for a special commercial school was felt in Prague. 
Mr. Johann Bachheibl, a member of the commercial council from 1831 to 1840, was 
the first to take up the matter, and to urge upon his colleagues the desirability of 
such an establishment. But many hindrances, especially the unfavorable conditions 
of the time, prevented them from carrying out the idea. It was not until the year 
1849 that the first real step toward such an institution was taken.

  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 7TA9 
The president of the commercial council in that year, Mr. Josef Halla, and a 
member of the corporation, Mr. Edward Pleschner, took up the idea with energy, 
for the need of such an institution was more and more keenly felt every day. The 
commercial council appointed a committee to obtain the necessary financial means, 
and in March, 1849, the committee published the following address to the merchants 
of Bohemia: : 
“The establishment of a commercial school in the capital city of Bohemia, a land 
where such a many-sided industry and trade flourish, has been a long-felt want. 
But it was not possible, under previous conditions, to establish this institute so 
necessary and advantageous for our youth. It remains further our honorable task 
by uniting all the necessary intelligent and pecuniary means to establish and 
develop acommercial institute. It appears superfluous to dwell upon the advantage 
of such an institution. Everyone of us reognizes how necessary to our prosperity 
is the regular and systematic training of our youth. We have been obliged up to 
the present to seek such a training for our sons in foreign countries, at the cost of 
much money and great anxiety. In the future we should find this at home. We all 
recognize, moreover, how greatly such a theoretical course would aid our young 
people when they go into practical life, and how much more useful they are to us 
when they have enjoyed the training of such an institution. The commercial 
council, inspired with this conviction, fas: therefore, resolved to establish such an 
institution. It proposes to cover the expenses in part by the use of its own capital, 
and in part by the contributions of founding and contributing members. We send, 
therefore, an earnest invitation to all members of the commercial and manufacturing 
classes of Bohemia to assist in the establishment of this useful institution, and by 
cooperative effort to leave this honorable memorial to our posterity. The com- 
mercial council has appointed a committee, which is not only to take charge of the 
new school, but to work outa curriculum upon the plan of the best existing com- 
mercial schools. The council has resolved further to make provision so that the 
apprentices in our shops, who are uot able to enter the school regularly, may obtain 
instruction in the practical knowledge relating to commerce from the teachers in 
this institute, In this arrangement we rely upon the humanity of our colleagues 
to assist us by sending regularly their apprentices, and prove in this way that they, 
as well as we, desire the training of useful and skillful clerks, and that in this way 
the value of this sort of instruction may be fably recegnized.” 
In answer to this invitation 12,000 florins were subscribed within a short time. 
As this sum, however, was not sufficient for the establishment of a higher commercial 
institute, the council resolved to organize a Sunday school for commercial branches. 
Steps were immediately taken to carry this resolution into effect. The school was 
opened on the 19th of April, 1850, on the birthday of the Emperor. Rooms were 
obtained for it in the Polytechnic Institute. 
This Sunday school, however, was intended only as a transition institute to the 
higher commercial school which was the end and aim of the eftorts of the council. 
The year 1851 brought a decisive turn in favor of the establishment of such an 
institution. In that year a man was chosen as presiding officer of the commercial 
council who possessed in himself all the qualities which were necessary to secure 
the realization of the plan above mentioned. 
Mr, Edward Pleschner, the new president, devoted his attention in the first place 
to increasing the endowment fund, and to overcoming the prejudices and objections 
against the project; which showed themselves here and there. His efforts were soon 
crowned with success. Tho fund was increased by June, 1853, to 34,398 florins; by 
the year 1855 the fund had reached 44,211 florins. The necessary financial means had 
thus been provided. 
There were many different views as to the manner in which the project should be 
carried out. Some favored the acquisition of a separate school building and the 
union of the Sunday school with the proposed academy. Others proposed that the 
Sunday school for commercial branches should be expanded so that instruction should 
be given on one week day, and that this should be gradually extended by the addi- 
tion of new subjects of instruction. A third party, under the lead of the president, 
wished to establish an independent higher commercial school, and this view was 
finally adopted. On the 18th of October a final decision was made, and the commer- 
cial council unanimously voted for the establishment of the independent commercial 
institute. 
The next effort of the council was devoted to the acquisition of a building, which 
was purchased shortly after for the sum of 58,542 florins. On the 13th of December, 
1855, the council held its first meeting in the halls of the school. 
On the 3d of October preceding the council had presented a petition to Count 
Leo Luhn, minister of religion and education, in which they expressed the convic- 
tion that the commercial classes, on account of the important position which they 
occupied from an economic and social point of view among the other classes in 
society, needed not only thorough professional knowledge, but also a higher general 
     
-P-A-G-E-826

training, and asked that the minister might permit the commercial council to estab- 
lish within the walls of Prague a new kind of institute, the like of which had not 
yet been established in Austria. 
The proposed curriculum included in the memorial embraced the following subjects: 
1. German language and literature. 
2. French, English, and Italian. 
3. Mathematies and commercial arithmetic. : 
4, Commercial and maritime law, and the law relating to promissory notes. 
5. Political econom 
6. Geography, history, and statistics. 
8. 
8.      
~ Natural history and physi 
. Chemistry. 
. Drawing and penmanship. 
10. Practical bookkeeping and correspondence, 
These subjects were selected in order that the pupil might be ready immediately 
upon leaving the academy to enter practical commercial work. 
Until the permission of the Government was obtained the committee occupied 
itself with the necessary preparations. It issued a circular letter to business men 
and manufacturers of Bohemia, in which it requested the donation of suitable mate- 
rial for tho museums and other collections. From all parts of the country specimens 
of raw materials and manufactures of every sort, natural history specimens and 
books poured in in such quantities that it would be difficult to find a similar wealth 
ore collections in any other German commercial school. 
On the 4th of March, 1856, the committee received permission to proceed with the 
opening and organization of the school, and the time for opening the school was set 
for the autumn of 1856. After the election of Mr. Karl Arenz, of Dusseldorf, as 
director of the institute, it was opened in a formal manner on the 4th of October, 
1856. The following quotations from the inaugural address of the director are of 
general interest: 
“The commercial schools are a product of this century. The only one whose exist- 
ence dates back into the preceding century is that of Biisch, the father of German 
commercial schools, which had been founded by him in Hamburg in 1768, under the 
name of ‘Commercial Academy.’ The schoel disappeared later, leaving nothing 
behind it but the grateful recollection of its honorable foundation and its me 
rious work. The commercial schools of to-day nearly all started about the s 
time, and are of the same general character. Schiebe pointed out the way in which 
they all thought they could prepare for the active career of the merchant. But the 
question as to how far these institutions were and are adapted to answer to the 
mighty advance of our material interests is a question which we can not further 
investigate on this eccasion. For it is our duty to-day to consider this new institu- 
tion whose opening we celebrate. 
“Tf we ask for the reasons which have called it into existence, it is not difficult to 
find them. In the time of a growing tendency toward the independence of every 
individual and every class, the necessity of the declaration of independence on the 
part of educational institutions which serve the various practical needs of modern life 
becomes evident. Commercial institutions belong in the same category with the 
technical institutions in so far as they have the common purpose of promoting in 
the first instance the development of our material welfare, but they are distinguished 
from these by certain internal qualities, by the fundamental principles underlying 
their foundation. In the case of the former it is the mathematical and natural 
science training through which the technical training is accomplished. In the case 
of the latter, on the contrary, the thread which runs through the curriculum, coor- 
dinating and uniting its various parts, is not higher mathematics, is not natural 
science, but is that thorough general culture which embraces a complex of general 
social knowledge and experience relating to the know ledge of the earth, relating to 
the economic nature of its inhabitants and to one’s native country, The necessity 
and justification of the existence of commercial schools, which met so many objec- 
tions in every quarter, and which, indeed, have given rise to most serious criticisms, 
are to be found in the necessity of the higher scientific training of the merchant. 
This appears more and more imperative every day, as this alone qualifies him to work 
in the different branches of trade and commerce with such foresight and certainty as 
is rendered necessary by the advance of our social relations. 
“The commercial schools must answer these demands. To use an expression of 
the elder Blanqui, the organizer of the oldest and most important commercial school 
in France: ‘They must organize our trade and commerce by training and instruc- 
tion.’ 
“T have already said that fora long time the most severe criticisms were made 
upon these commercial schools, and yet this has not prevented their growth and 
development. Men were not willing to grant them an independent standing, and 
yet they gave them a certain ‘place in the polytechnic school. This declaration of 
    
  
       
  
      
     
-P-A-G-E-827
    COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 751 
dependence was the first step toward independence. For exjferience has shown that 
this union of a commercial division with a polytechnic school was an unequal one, 
and very disadvantageous for commercial instruction. For, on the one hand, the 
natural center of gravity of commercial instruction is not to be found in such a 
union, and, on the other hand, it has never been able to secure, in such a combina- 
tion, equal recognition with the other faculties of the polytechnic school. This 
explains the unsatisfactory results of such commercial courses bath from a statistical 
and scientific standpoint. Tho union of technical and commercial courses leads, 
moreover, to what is, from a pedagogical point of view, a wrong treatment of tho 
pupils, and this is the moral ground which compels us to urge a separation of the 
commercial schools from the technical institutions, and an independent organization 
of the former. ‘The technical institutes accomplish excellent results in their own 
sphere, but the very excellence of this work means injury to the commercial side. 
“The merchant, since he belongs to the higher classes of society, must receive 
such a training in the school as will fit him to maintain his position. This school 
must be for him a technical or professional training school. It stands in the midst 
of all the other technical and professional schools, and utilizes them all. It has 
peculiar characteristics of its own, and must, therefore, be independent. I will not, 
however, dwell further upon this point of the independence ot commercial schools 
for fear of exposing myself to the same ridicule as the learned scholar who wished 
to lecture to Hannibal upon the art of war. 
“Let us consider for a moment the organization of commercial schools. If we wish 
for success, the plan of organization must not bea rigid one. It must not be for the 
school aniron frame which shall hold it within unchangeable limits. On the contrary, 
it must have regard to tho very life of the institution itself, and must correspond to 
the demands of the ever-advancing development of trade and industry. 
“Tf we consider the organization of the curriculum which our scheme has accepted. 
as tho basis of the higher training of the merchant, its fundamental principle appears 
to be the greatest possible thoroughness, and continual reference to its practical ap- 
plicability. The theoretical and practical sciences must aid and supplement one 
another. The first formulate general laws; the latter teach their application to 
given material. To go from theory down to practice, and to rise from practice to 
theory, is, and must be, the leading ‘principle in the organization of the commercial 
school. It will draw everything into the circle of its activity; it will tend to fit the 
merchant to occupy the position with honor and success in which he has been placed 
by the relations of modern society. To limit the education of the merchant to that 
quantity of knowledge known in ordinary life as mercantile would be to mistake his 
present position and his far-reaching circle of activity. The merchant is, to use the 
expression which the municipality of Mons employed in an address to the King of 
Belgium on occasion of the celebration of the constitution in July, 1856: ‘He is, so 
to speak, the industrial center into which all the threads run, and in which social 
relations cross each other and unite; into which they lead; from which they again 
run out in order to establish new combinations, which again find their common point 
in this industrial center.’ 
“The merchant must have a broad view. He must be trained to be at home in all 
relations, for his activity is an ever-changing one; it knows neither time nor place; 
it enlivens, moves, and supports the material interests of society. Commerce em- 
Draces in its giant arms the whole world, and forces it to put all its powers at its 
disposal. It unites by the stroke of the: pen al] the countries of the world. 
“The educational institution, therefore, which is destined to work out the higher 
training of the merchant, must, above all, take into the circle of its consideration 
everything which can be made useful for its purpose, and this it can do if a reasona- 
ble pedagog cal plan be followed in the division and distribution of its subjects of 
instruction, and if we do not lose sight of the fact that the various sciences are not 
to be treated separately as in the various special and technical schools, and are not 
to be taught for their own sake. For it is perfectly plain that we can accomplish 
nothing in any science, which the higher commercial school takes up, if it is to be 
taught foritselfalone. In technical schools, academies, and other higher professional 
institutions, the particular branches of science and the manner in which they are te 
be taught and utilized are determined and conditioned by the ‘purpose in view. I 
need only mention chemistry, mechanics, and other practical sciences, 
“Although it is true that ‘the merchant can never be entirely separated from the 
manufacturer, and that the one activity continually runs into ‘the other, yet it can 
not be our purpose to make of the merchant a technically trained manufacturer, a 
scientific technologist. ‘They go together, it is true, but they are not identical; the 
polytechnic trains the latter, the higher commercial school the former, and we must 
leave to each institution its peculiar work, The scheme of instruction which is to 
train merchants must be an associative one; it must know how to present in a clear 
light that which is relative, in its relative relations; it must know how to create a 
whole out of the manifold elements in its curriculum, It must form an organism; 
           
     
               
   
     
          
     
       
-P-A-G-E-828
    752 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
for the life of the eduéational system must be organic. In it all the various means 
of education must work toward a unity of result, and, therefore, the main thing in 
the commercial school is the unity of its curriculum. This attempt to secure a unity 
by the combination of many diferent elements has not always been successful. It 
is, however, the fundamental thought of this institution. 
“We have included in our curriculum three classes of educational branches: First, 
the really technical or professional; second, those which may be included under the 
head of applied sciences, and third, the purely general or liberal elements. I need 
not dwell upon the first, for that is the narrowly technical, the so-called mercantile 
training; but this will become a.mere dead routine if it is not supported, supple- 
mented, and enlivened at every point by science. Clearness of vision and thorough 
self-control, the fundamental characteristics of the merchant, can only be acquired 
by science; just as a wealth of vision, freshness, vividness are to be obtained for 
science only from life itself. The real specific activity of the merchant is concerned 
with office duty, with the handling of products, and with the direction of commerce 
and trade. The knowledge of products considered as the combination of various 
kinds of knowledge necessary in dealing with commercial products is based upon 
natural history and chemistry, which play such an important part in the physiology 
of animals and plants, and hias made modern mineralogy largely a chemical science. 
These two subjects are necessary as a means of recognizing products and of judging 
of their genuineness and adulteration. Technology is also an auxiliary science in 
the knowledge of products, for this teaches the mer chant something in regard to the 
various branches of manufacture—spinning, weaving, etc. The knowledge of sim- 
ple machines belongs also to this department. The limits of instruction in these 
subjects must be set by the extent of those products the knowledge of which is abso- 
Tutely necessary to the merchant, and that instruction in this field must relate pri- 
marily to domestic, raw, and manufactured products is a matter of course. 
“ Another side of the mercantile training which is intimately related to that just 
discussed is the geographico-statistical. Geography and statistics are the basis of 
exchange in commodities. The branches which assist in directing the course of com- 
merce are history of commerce, which teaches one the course of human civilization, 
and political economy based on this branch and on geography and statistics. To 
the narrowly mercantile training belongs also skill in arithmetic and in the various 
practical work belonging to the “office in its various rel: ations, also in the usages of 
trade and in commercial legislation, as well as fluency in the use of modern lange uages 
so far as they are commercial languages. This side of the training of the merchant 
must also have its center of gravity or point of combination, and this may be found 
in a model office, imitating an actual office; the value of, which, however, ‘it must be 
admitted, is often called into question. Iti is, however, in my opinion, so to speak, 
the laborator y of the future merchant, which at present is lacking in most German 
commercial se chools, and which we must organize here. 
“But besides this ‘specifica ally technical training, the institution must also afford its 
pupils a patriotic and moral training; a training of the character, for the future posi- 
tion of our pupils demands more than an exclusively professional education, and 
nothing is more suitable to throw into their true light the well-known socialistic and 
communistic vagaries than correct conceptions of religion, patriotism, history, politi- 
cal economy, and law. One’s character gains in firmness by a consideration of the 
truths of science; that indifference, which so often forces intellectual and material 
interests into the background and favors the development of moral and political 
weakness, must yield to determination and moral power. If we leave no intellectual 
power of the youth undeveloped, we may hope on the one hand that the pupil during 
his residence in this institution will gain besides the necessary knowledge for his 
future calling that enthusiasm for the practical work within it which will be a great 
source of encouragement during all his future life, and, on the other hand, that this 
enthusiasm will serve as the basis of a view of life which will maintain for the youth 
during his manhood an open eye and a ready hand to aid and assist the great material 
and ideal interests of our society. 
“These, in brief, are the principles which have led me in working out the plan of 
organization of this institution, which already counts in the very first hour of its 
formal existence a greater number of pupils than any other commercial institute of 
the present or former times.” 
Thus the institution was opened, and has continued its work from that time to 
this, except when it was disturbed for a short time during the summer of 1866 during 
the Austro-Prussian war. 
That the establishment of the Commercial Academy of Prague really exercised an 
epoch-making influence in Austria, and that all the other institutions established 
later have taken its organization more or less as a model, is plain from the fact that 
the well-known statistician, Von Roden, who had been chosen a member of the 
organizing committee of the Vienna Commercial Academy, immediately entered 
into correspondence with Director Arenz, in order to inform himself thoroughly as 
      
  
   
-P-A-G-E-829
    COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 753 
to the institute in Prague. The Academy for Trade and Industry at Gratz also took 
the institution at Prague as its model for the commercial division of its work; the 
Commercial School at Reichenberg likewise based its curriculum upon that of the 
institute at Prague. The Prague Academy has also exercised a considerable influ- 
ence upon the development of similar schools in other countries. ‘ - 
It is an interesting fact that the director at this school considers it a very unwise 
thing for boys to go from elementary schools first into business, and then to return 
to the commercial school at a later period for further education. He says that the 
idea that this is a good plan to follow rests upon a false educational notion. About 
24 per cent of the students of the Prague Academy, up to 1872, had followed this 
plan, and the experience of the school in the great majority of the cases shows that 
it is very unwise for young people to go into a business house before they take the 
course of the school, and that the other plan of taking the course first and then 
going into a business house is the proper one. In the latter case the advanced 
instruction of the academy joins directly on to the general course of instruction 
which the pupil has had in the elementary school. The youth is, moreover, more 
willing to adapt himself to the necessary school discipline; it is easier for him to 
take up certain subjects, and he adapts himself more readily to steady work in the 
scientific and practical branches than when he is older. 
The supposed advantages of the other plan are generally bought at the expense of 
the great disadvantage that many important details of previous instruction slip out 
of the memory during the time spent in the business house, by which it becomes 
more difficult for the youth to take up his course of study again. The certificate of 
having served an apprenticeship is not able to give the youth that tendency toward 
study which he loses in practical life. On the other hand, the young man who 
enters a business house after completing this course takes with him a riper mind, on 
account of which he can learn the details of the business much more easily than he 
otherwise could. 
The director is also of the opinion that the pupils who attend the academy ought 
not to be otherwise occupied, for this institution, like every other school, demands 
an absolutely undivided application, without which no systematic, coherent, and 
thoroughly rounded education can be obtained, If the pupil wishes for the best 
results from his instruction, he must, so long as he attends the academy, give his 
entire time to the work, and those youths who have attempted to unite practical 
work with instruction in the school have soon experienced the disadvantage of this 
combination, and have given up either one or the other. 
    HISTORY OF THE INSTITUTION FROM 1856 TO 1872. 
The attendance at the academy at Prague was so large in the school year 1857-58 
that the instruction had to be given in parallel divisions of from fifty to fifty-four 
pupils. The second year of the course was opened in the autumn of 1857 and 
the third year of the course in the autumn of 1858, The higher commercial school 
consisted, therefore, of a regular course of three years and of a preparatory class. 
The latter was abolished in 1864, as the number of students steadily decreased, and 
the necessary preparation could be obtained in other schools owing to the increase in 
the number of gymnasia and real schools. As the term academy was used for the 
commercial schools founded in Budapest in 1857, in Vienna in 1858, and in Gratz 
in 1861, the commercial council was led to claim the right to the same title for its 
institution, which was granted it by an ordinance of the Government on the 14th of 
March, 1866, in consideration of the comprehensive curriculum of the Higher Com- 
mercial Institute in Prague, of the firm establishment of the same in pecuniary 
matters, and in consideration of its excellent work. 
In the winter of 1859-60 the popular evening lectures were established, intended 
for the general public, on bookkeeping, correspondence, commercial arithmetic, 
commercial law, French, tariff legislation, money, and banking. In the year 1860-61 
a new element was introduced into the curriculum under the title of exercises in 
speaking, which will be noted again later. In 1862 the relations of the professors 
were regulated by a set of ordinances adopted by the council relating to their rights 
and duties. In 1863 the council ordered that from that time on the pupils of the 
Commercial Academy, in cases of illness, should be treated gratis in the new Mer- 
chant Guild Hospital. 
On the 31st of December, 1870, the president of the commercial council, in the 
presence of a delegation of that body, presented Director Arenz a written address in 
which the council expressed its thanks to the director of the academy for his services 
to the institution. The following quotation seems worth noting: 
“On the 4th of October, 1856, the Merchant Guild of Prague held a celebration, 
the memory of which will long remain in the minds of those who were permitted to 
share in it. We opened at that time an institute whose mission was to train and 
educate in the commercial sciences the rising generation of merchants, and in this

way to contribute to the prosperity of our national trade. If we consider the results 
achieved by this institute in the course of the fourteen years of its existence, we 
must acknowledge that they are in every respect satisfactory. 
“The Commercial Ac ademy of Pragne holds to- day an honored position among the 
educational institutions of our belove ed country, and has had an attendance, since 
tho first year of its organization, far exceeding the expectations of its founders, and 
forming the most trustworthy measure of its services. Hundreds of young men 
who have completed the three-year course of the institute have gone out into prac- 
tical life, and are at work to-day in the various commercial and industrial houses at 
home and abroad, utilizing there the knowledge which they acquired in the Com- 
mercial Academy at Prague. 
“That this institute has been able to develop such a blessing-bringing activity is 
due, Mr. Director, in a large part to you, who conceived the plan according to which 
the instruction in this institute should be organized. You have been since its 
beginning the director of its work, and have accomplished in this capacity a work 
with your colleagues of the results of which the Commercial Academy may well 
be proud.” 
The purpose of the Prague Academy has been from the beginning to direct the 
activity of its pupils immediately toward the true and at the same timo all-round 
and strictly professional training of the future merchant by subordinating every- 
thing to this end and by bringing the various branches of learning into such an 
internal connection that they supplement and explain one another. Its course of 
study, as described above, embraces thrée classes, each with a one-year curriculum. 
account of the large number of pupils each of these classes is divided into two 
-tions or parallel divisions with the samo instruction. 
“Tho method of instruction has been from the beginning the catechetical, which 
keeps the teacher and the pupil in unbroken relation to one another and enables 
the latter to have at every moment a correct judgment as to the work of the pupil, 
and thus to concentrate the work of the instruction upon the real work of teaching 
and not upon the mere preparation for the final examination. Instruction in the 
model office is also free from nonessentials. Its main purpose is directed toward 
accomplishing a clear insight and understanding of details both in themselves and 
in their relation to the whole, and in this way to develop the pupil into a thinking 
merehant, combining for this purpose theoretical accounting with the other auxiliary 
work which belongs to it and with correspondence. 
A not unimportant element in the instruction is formed by the exercises in speak- 
ing mentioned above. After a brief introduction relating to the fundamental prin- 
ciples of rhetoric and the history of eloquence, the pupils of the last year’s class are 
required in turn to make speeches in the first place upon subjects which are assigned 
to them. The essays are carefully examined beforehand by the respective professors 
in order that nothing unsuitable shall be presented. The speaker then delivers his 
essay without reference to his manuscript. After this speech a debate is opened, in 
which any other pupil may take part after those regularly assigned for the work 
have delivered their speeches. The debates are conducted in the } presence of a pro- 
fessor, who, at the close, gives a general criticism of the work. 
The instructing body’ of the academy consists of a director, professors, and the 
assistant teachers. The professors are appointed permanently after a probation of 
three years. 
The youth who attend the Commercial Academy are either regular or special 
pupils. Regular pupils are those who expect to complete all the required subjects 
in the curriculum. Special students are those who wish to attend the instruction in 
single branches. The pupils who wish to enter the lowest class must be able to 
show that they have completed the lower real school, or a lower gymnasium, or an 
equivalent course. Those who present certificates of graduation from either of the 
above-mentioned schools are admitted without examination. The pupils who desire 
admission into the middle or upper class must show by an examination that they 
possess the requisite knowledge of the curriculum of the first and second years, 
respectively. At the close of the three-year course the final examination is held. 
This examination is both oral and wr itten; it begins early in the month of July 
and lasts fourteen days. The final certificate, signed by the director and all the 
professors engaged in the work of the last year, notes the work done in each 
branch, giving the marks “very good,” “good,” “satisfactory,” ‘hardly satisfac- 
tory,” ‘‘bad.” A final mark is given covering the entire examination, and classing 
the work either as ‘‘excellent,” “well done,” or “pass.” 
Whoever does not succeed in obtaining ‘at least the mark of “pass” receives no 
certificate, but upon demand he may receive a statement that he has attended the 
work of the class during the past year. The students who pass this final examina- 
tion with success are admitted into the one- year voluntary service in the army and 
into the postal service and administrative service. 
The school endeavors to secure for its graduates positions in prominent business

houses, industrial establishments, banks, ete. The mercantile public knows that 
the aci ademy ¥ ommends only competent persons, and its candidates find, therefore, 
responsible and in most cases well-paying positions. 
As to the financial control of the avademy, this is exclusively in the hands of the 
commercial council. The scientific and pedagogical control of the institute is 
entirely in the hands of the director and the faculty. Each class has its own director 
or dean, who has the special duty of looking after the particular class and forming 
a sort of intermediate grade between the other teachers and the director. 
The yearly tuition is 150 florins. Special students pay at the rate of 7 guidena 
year for each course, of one hour a week. 
The administrative council of the academy may grant entire or partial remission 
of tuition. In 1873 about 25 per cent of the students were exempted from tuition, 
owing to the fact that they held scholarships or that the administrative council had 
exempted them from tuition. 
It is interesting to note that the institution has been, from the beginning, entirely 
dependent on its own resources, and has never been in a condition compelling it to 
ask for outside aid, whether in the form of Government grants or in the form of 
contributions from private citizens or corporations, with the exception of the endow- 
ment mentioned above. Not only has it been able to pay its expenses out of its 
income, but it has been able to add from time to time a certain surplus to its 
endowment. 
In November, 1872, a course in railroading and postal and telegraph service was 
organized. Students desiring to enter this course were required to have passed 
through an upper gymnasium, an upper real school, a commercial institute, or somo 
other equivalent school, or they were required to pass a corresponding examination. 
The candidates for the telegraph course must not be over 17, and those in the rail- 
road course not under 20 nor over 30. Persons actually employed in railroad service 
were admitted as special students. Postal cadets, stationed in Prague, were required 
to attend the postal-service course. The curriculum extended over one year. The 
courses began on the third Monday in October, and in the case of the course in 
telegraphy lasted four months. The lectures in the railroad courses and in the 
postal-service courses lasted until the middle of April. The curriculum was organ- 
ized as follows:

  One hundred and fifteen students were enrolled in the telegraph course, 73 in the 
railroad course, and 69 in the postal-service course. The tuition for the telegraph 
course and for the railroad course was 12 florins each and for the postal service 8 
florins. Those who had passed the examination in the telegraph course were eligible 
for appointment in the telegraph stations throughout Bohemia. 
According to an order of the ministry, dated January 7, 1875, these technical 
courses were to remain a permanent part of the Commercial Academy of Prague, 
and a State grant of 2,000 florins was made for three years, beginning with 1875. 
These courses were, however, abolished in the year 1877, and the commercial council 
was compelled to let them drop, owing to the fact that it could not carry them on 
with good financial results. 
The evening courses, spoken of above, owing to decreasing interest, increasing 
cost, and growing difficulties in the way of carrying them out, were dropped at the 
end of the school ; year 1860-61. 
    PURPOSE AND PRESENT ORGANIZATION OF THE ACADEMY. 
The present purpose of the academy, as expressed in the announcements of the 
school, is to furnish to those young men who have a proper preliminary education a 
theoretical and practical training for commerce in the widest sense of that term. It

is a special school for the purpose of giving a special training, characterized by a 
fundamental feature running throughout the entire course of its instruction, and 
which aims to give its pupils the kind of training which will prepare them, upon 
leaving the school, for the various departments of business activity. The various 
subjects in its curriculum are united in a close organic connection; they complement 
and explain one another, and, as a whole, aim at raising the level of the general 
culture of the pupils at the same time that they impart the necessary special knowl- 
edge. The instruction in the mercantile subjects, in the narrow sense, is not limited 
either to purely theoretical discussions nor to the acquisition of commercial mechanical 
facilities. It is, on the contrary, at once theoretical and practical. It is intended 
that the pupils shall acquire the necessary insight into the actual conduct of trade 
and commerce at the same time that they acquire those external facilities which 
belong to this particular branch of human industry. For this latter purpose the 
various practical exercises in the model office are especially intended. 
Besides the scientific and professional training of its pupils, the Commercial Acad- 
emy lays a special emphasis upon a broad training and the moral development of its 
pupils, in order to secure as far as possible the desirable maturity and firmness of 
character appropriate to the social position of the merchant. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE INSTRUCTION.—The Commercial Academy conducts two 
distinct courses—a three-year course and a one-year course. The latter is intended 
for ths graduates of the intermediate schools. The German language is used as the 
language of instruction, and the following subjects are included in the curriculum 
of the three-year course: 
German language and literature.—Exercises in grammar, in style, and in speaking, 
in order to train the student to a correct and fluent expression of his thought. The 
exercises in speaking are intended to train the pupil to self-control and clearness in 
expressing himself in discussions before the general public. The history of litera- 
ture makes the student acquainted with the most important products of German 
literature as an important element of general culture. 
The other important foreign languages.—French and English are required subjects; 
the participation of the pupils in Italian, Spanish, and Bohemian is optional. The 
chief weight in these languages is laid on practical instruction in speaking and 
writing for the mercantile career; mercantile correspondence in each of these lan- 
guages receives, therefore, special attention; at the same time the students are 
expected to make themselves acquainted with the most important literary works in 
these languages. 
Algebra.—F undamental conceptions; logarithms; equations; calculations of prob- 
abilities; proportions. 
Mercantile and political arithmetic.—Knowledge of usage; practical: training in all 
the various kinds of calculation useful in business life; arbitrage; calculation of 
funds and loans and life insurance; casting of produce and usages. 
Theory of trade.—Correspondence; office work; single and double entry bookkeep- 
ing with practical exercises (these Jast are provided for in the model office); the 
conduct of the model business house (the pupils are divided into several sections 
representing agencies or offices in the different centers of trade which carry on com- 
merce with one another, The mercantile, banking, and shipping business receive 
special attention. Great care is taken that each pupil shall receive training in each 
of these different departments without losing sight of the business as a whole. At 
the end of the year the operations of the house are closed and balanced. 
Penmanship. 
Mercantile and industrial geography.—Study of the Austro-Hungarian State; a care- 
ful study of the Austrian Empire in regard to its physical and technical development 
and its commercial importance. Industrial and commercial statistics by the com- 
parative method. 
History with continual reference to commerce and trade.—General history of the world’s 
commerce; history of the development of domestic trade. 
Political economy.—Development of the fundamentalnotions for the correct concep- 
tions of economic relations; theory of production, exchange, income, and taxation. 
Commercial and industrial legislation.—Study of the important provisions, from a 
mercantile point of view, of the civil law, of commercial law, and industrial and 
financial legislation. 
Natural history.—With special reference to the relations which are most important 
to the knowledge of products. 
Physics.—The most important natural laws and phenomena in their technical and 
commercial applications. F 
Knowledge of products, chemistry, and technology.—The study of the origin and com- 
position of commercial products, and the methods of testing the same as to their 
constituents, quantity, genuineness, and adulteration by practical exercises. Dis- 
enssion of the most important technical and mechanical manufactures, and expla- 
nation of the machines used in such work. Third-year pupils have the opportunity,

by practical excursions, of becoming acquainted with the agriculture, trade, and 
industry of Bohemia. 
Stenography.—With special reference to the needs of the office. 
h OF INSTRUCTIO. In order to promote ‘the efficiency of the instruction the 
academy Possesses— 
(1) i library for the use of teachers and pupils. 
(2) A collection of products which is kept up to date, so that 1t may fairly be con- 
sidered an exposition of everything which is important for trade and commerce. 
(3) A natural history museum, in close connection with the collection of products, 
(4) A collection of physical, mechanical, and technological apparatus, so far as is 
necessary, to make the instruction of the school effective. 
(5) A collection of technological wall maps as an aid to instruction in chemistry 
and knowledge of products. 
(6) A chemical laboratory for teachers and pupils. 
(7) A collection of coins. 
A satisfactory idea of the manner in which these various subjects are treated will 
be found by comparing the synopsis of the subjects of instruction given in the Vienna 
Commercial Aca ademy, which covers essentially the same ground.! 
Privileges connected with the certificate of graduation from the ac adeny.—The regular 
pupils who have completed the entire course and passed the final examination are 
entitled to take advantage of the one-year military service law.

Statistics.—The report of the academy for 1891 and 1892 gives the following infor- 
mation as to students attending the three-year course: 
Four hundred and forty pupils attended the course. Of these, 152 were in the first 
year’s course; 161 were in the second; 127 were in the third. It will be observed 
that the number of pupils in the third year formed a very large per cent of the num- 
ber in the first year. Of the 43£ whose names were on the rolls at the end of the 
year, 177 were Catholics; 17 were Protestants; 240 were Jews; 371 were from Bohe- 
mia, 105 being from the city of Prague alone. There were also 6 students from Ger- 
many; 3 from Russia; 2 from Roumania; 1 from France, and 1 from Egypt.

Of tho 434 pupils, 14 were 15 years of age; 81 were 16 years of age; 130 were 17 
years of age; 120 were 18 years of age; 58 were 19 years of age; 24 were 20 years of 
age; 4 were 21 years of age; 1 was 35 years of age, and 1 was 28 years of age— 
showi ing that the great m: ajority were between tho ages of 16 and 20. Considerably 
more than three-fourths of the students were over 17; about one-half over 18; 191 
were sons of merchants, 49 of manufacturers, 79 of Government officials, 33 of produce 
men, 26 of farmers, and the others of various other professions. It will be noted 
that the vast majority of them were from what might be called the business classes. 
It is interesting to note that 106 of the pupils ‘studied Italian; 42 Spanish; 187 
stenography. Also, that 10 of the students were exempted from the payment of fees 
altogether; 65 received 50 per cent remission, and 12 held the various scholarships, 
  THE ONE: 
  EAR COURSE, 
The purpose of the one-year course is to offer to young men with an advanced 
preliminary training, in the shortest possible time, such an amount of commercial 
knowledge as will prepare them for a position in some business house, or as will 
supplement their general educational training, so as to be of assistance in some other 
occupation.

Asynopsis of these subjects may be fairly well understood from the similar synopsis 
in the case of the Commercial Academy at Vienna. 
Various provisions in regard to this course.—No person can he admitted to this course 
who has not successfully completed the highest class of a domestic or foreign inter- 
mediate school. Persons are not required to have passed, however, the final exami- 
nation in this intermediate school. As no students are admitted with any different 
preliminary training, all the pupils are classed as regulars, and no student is admitted 
unless he takes all the instruction given. Only such pupils are admitted as are 
thoroughly at home in the German “language; foreigners must give evidence of a 
mastery of German before being admitted to this course. The number of pupils is 
limited to forty. The course begins on the Ist of October and closes the middle of 
July. The tuition is 150 florins a year; no remissions or reductions of tuition are 
ranted. 
e Statistics.—The report of the academy for 1891-92 shows that there were 16 pupils 
in this course at the end of the year: Catholics, 8; Protestant, 1; Jews, 7. All the 
pupils were over 18 years of age. Two were 18 years old, 1 was 19, 2 were 20, 4 
were 21, 5 were 22, 1 was 23, and 1 was 25, Eleven were graduates of the gymna- 
sium and 5 of the real school. 
Budget of the academy.—Theo financial report of the Merchant Guild of Prague for 
the year ending December 31, 1891, shows that the income of the academy for that 
year was 55,522.50 florins, Of this sum 1,600 florins came from endowment, 52,512.50 
florins came from tuition in the three-year course; 1,275 florins came from tuition in 
the one-year course; 135 florins came from laboratory fees. Its expenses were classed 
as follows: xes, 1,124.30 florins; sinking fund and rent, 4,000 florins; salaries, 
27,021.64 florins; contribution to the Merchant Guild, 2,319.98; repairs, 1,567.56

tures, 46,000 florins. The total expenses for the academy up to December 31, 1885, 
amounted to 889,476,40 florins; the total income amounted to 918,905.53 florins,

  Statistics of atiendance.—The statistics of attendance are given in the following lis 
  
  
  According to the foregoing table it appears that the attendance at the academy 
from § to 1885 amounted to 3 234, of whom about 86 per cent were from Bohemia, 
and about 13 per cent from foreign countries. Of these pupils 61 per cent were sons 
of business men; 19 per cent were sons of officials and German officers; 14 per cent 
were sons of farmers, capitalists, ete.; 6 per cent were sons of professional men. 
Fifty-three per cent came from real schools; 31 per cent came from gymnasia; 12 
per cent came from private schools; 4 per cent came from other commercial schools. 
It appears that of this number 2,128, or 70 per cent, of all the pupils who entered 
the school, completed the three-year course. Of later years the record is very much 
more favorable, rising in some instances as high as 95 per cent. 
Faculty.—The faculty for the year 1891-92 consisted of a director and 17 teachers.

Salaries and pensions.—It is an interesting feature in most of the European schools, 
whether private or public, that some arrangement is usually made for the granting 
of pensions to teachers who have served a certain length of time in the institution. 
The Merchant Guild of Prague has provided a pension fund, to be made up partly of 
grants made by the Merchant Guild itself, by contributions of the professors of the 
school, and by a certain per cent of the surplus income of the school. 
Every professor is entitled to a pension after serving ten consecutive years as a 
member of the faculty of the Commercial Academy. The pension is payable as soon 
as the professor; in consequence of bodily or mental disease, becomes unable to act 
as instructor; in all cases upon the completion of forty years of service. The amount 
of the pension, after ten years of service, is 40 per cent of the salary, and rises 2 per 
cent every year, so that after forty years of service a professor is entitled to his full 
salary for the rest of his life. 
The professors are appointed at a salary of 1,000 florins, which is raised every five 
years by the sum of 200 florins, so that after twenty-five years of service the salary 
amounts to 2,000 florins. Every professor who wishes to enjoy the pension privi- 
lege must, within twelve months after his definitive appointment, contribute the 
third part of one year’s salary to the pension fund, and must further contribute a 
third part of each quinquennial addition to his sala The widow of a professor 
who had become entitled to @ pension is entitled to a pension of 350 florins a year so 
long as she remains a widow, and the allowance to the widow for the support of the 
children of the professor who had become entitled to a pension is calculated accord- 
ing to the rule adopted by the Governinent for civil-service officials, provided that 
the pension of the mother and the allowance of the children shall not exceed the sum 
of 525 florins. 
The preceding pages contain a description of the two most important higher schools 
for commercial studies in Austria, but these two schools do not, by any means, repre- 
sent the only opportunity for youth who expect to enter business to acquire aspecial 
training for their future work. Indeed, it may be doubted whether any other coun- 
try has organized so complete a system of commercial instruction as Austria. The 
department of education has given special attention, in the last few years, to the 
.development of this branch of instruction, and while the number of schools is not 
large, considering the needs of a modern industrial and commercial community, the 
system on which they are organized is an excellent one, and there is no doubt that it 
will be further extended in the near future. 
Professor Glasser’s book on Commercial Education in Austria! gives full informa- 
tion as to the present state of commercial education, so far as it can be ascertained 
from an exposition of the laws bearing upon the subject, and by the statistics as to 
attendance, ete., in these schools. According to a table printed in that work, there 
are 13 commercial high schools of the general rank of the Commercial Academy in 
Vienna and the similar one in Prague, in the Austrian monarchy, excluding Hun- 
gary. About 3,000 pupils attend these schools. There are 104 other schools, which 
may be classed as commercial institutions, covering the ground, more or less fully, 
. appropriated in this country by the commercial colleges, though in nearly all cases 
the curriculum is based upon more scientific principles and is more carefully deyvel- 
oped in the Austrian schools than in our own. The same experience has been met in 
Austria as in other countries, that the attempt to develop commercial courses side 
by side with other courses in the same institution has not been successful. Gener- 
ally speaking, such courses have given satisfaction to no class of people; they 
interfere with the healthy development of the other courses in the institution, and 
are uniformly neglected by the authorities of the institation with which they are 
connected.

    HIGHER COMMERCIAL INSTRUCTION IN FRANCE, 
1—THE SUPERIOR SCHOOL OF COMMERCE AT PARIS. 
I.—HIsToRY OF ITS FOUNDATION AND DEVELOPMENT! 
In 1820 two Paris merchants, MM. Brodard and Legret, interested in the future of 
French commerce, conceived the project of founding a school for the purpose of pre- 
paring young men for business by specialstudies, supplementary to their general 
instruction. These men of enterprise, whose names deserve to be saved from an 
unjust oblivion, created for this purpose, in the Hotel des Fermes in rue de Grenelle- 
Saint-Honoré, an establishment of a type at that time absolutely new, to which they 
gave the name ‘‘Special School of Commerce.” 
Such an enterprise, which seems to us to-day so natural, was bold for the epoch at 
which our modest innovators undertookit. Infact, public opinion did not at that time 
recognize either the necessity or even the possibility of such instruction, for which 
practice alone up to that time had provided. Ifpeople would admit, on being pressed, 
that our industry needed trained assistants, capable of constructing and caring for 
the machines? which it employed, by repairing accidents which occurred in foundries 
and machine shops, no one thought that commerce could ever become a subject of 
instruction in the school, because, as every one claimed, on account of thé multi- 
plicity of the specialties of which it is composed. 
The basis of this idea, which furnishes some specious arguments of a nature very 
seductive to the prejudices of the superficial minds of mere routinists, will not bear 
examination. For if it is true that after having studied the sciences listed in the 
programme of commercial instruction there are still in each branch of commerce 
peculiar difficulties, dangers, resources—in a word, trade secrets, so to speak—it is not 
Jess true that the man who has been prepared by study willadvance more surely and 
steadily along his chosen way, and that, circumstances being equal, he will possess 
after a short period of practice an undisputed superiority, thanks to the instruction 
which he has received. In other words, there exists an amount of commercial knowl- 
edge, at once theoretical and practical, which one can acquire in a school, and which 
can be taught only there. It must be added, of course, that the actual management 
of real business affairs can alone complete this instruction. 
The creation of a special school of commerce, a scientific institution up to that 
time without a predecessor, offered other numerous difficulties. It was not only 
necessary to group into one body of studies, methodically organized, all those 
branches of knowledge which might be useful to a merchant, but also to choose and 
train professors, to select and classify the studies, and, finally, to find a public, a 
clientele. In a word, one had to create the pupils, so to speak, and this was not the 
easiest thing in the world, considering the ideas of the time. 
Moreover, the obstacles which these innovators encountered did not come alone 
from the prejudices against which the schools of commerce to-day must still struggle. 
It was denied at that time that we possessed the qualities essential to commerce; 
that our French spirit was suited to the slow continuousness of distant trade; to the 
chances of long-extended speculations upon which the business of importation and 
exportation depends. One did not see that our spirit, because of its very impres- 
sionableness and mobility, lends itself admirably to all these forms of business. 
Finally, men refused to recognize that our French intelligence, so keen, so supple, 
so broad, contained the germs of ability which necessity on the one hand and our

high tastes and love of riches on tho other were destined to develop. In proof of 
this fact the industrial and commercial progression, proven by statistics, may be 
cited—a progression which wonld haye been doubled and tripled by that economic 
instruction, the lack of which France cruelly misses to-day. 
In 1820 there were in addition, in the very situation of things, other serious obstacles, 
The country had just emerged from the great wars of the Republic and Empire, 
which had excited allits brilliant faculties, and it was very difficult for the nation 
to pass over quickly to the consideration of industry and commerce; to enter with- 
out hesitation upon that which men disdainfully called “a mercantile career.” The 
young men of the middle class of society, for whom this new establishment was 
specially intended, leaned toward the so-called liberal careers; they wished to be 
lawyers, physicians, writers; no one wished to be a merchant. These young men 
regarded it as a sort of derogation, an acknowledgment of inferiority, to devote 
themselves to commerce—that is to say, to a specialty of the ‘earth, earthy,” which 
did not merit serious study; and we have seen that the university, whose classical 
spirit incited to the admiration of the past, has contributed no little to confirm our 
countrymen in these ideas, which have paralyzed, and still paralyze, the industrial 
and commercial enterprises of Franc 
It was under these circumstances, little favorable to its development, that the new 
school, shortly after transferred to the Hotel Sully in the rue Saint Antoine, was 
organized. Some large buildings, spacious courts, and a large garden were put at 
its disposal. A physical cabinet, a chemical laboratory, and collections of products 
were established at a large cost. A numerous personnel, too numerous perhaps, was 
brought together. Finally, the school assumed a uniform, ried a sword, and all 
its internal movements were carried on to the sound of a drum. 
But besides these features, a little ambitious for the ends of a private school, a 
council composed of distinguished men, members of the institute, bankers, manu- 
facturers, merchants, who comprehended and appreciated at its true value the 
attempt of MM. Brodard and Legret, devoted itself to framing a programme of 
instruction, an organization of studies, and modifying it according to necessity and 
assuring its execution. Having learned by study and experience what various quali- 
ties and what various branches of knowledge are indispensable to one who would 
undertake a commercial career, these men, among whom we find the names of Chaptal, 
Jaeques Lafitte, Ternau, Lonis Marchand, Casimir Périer, J. B. Say, Charles Dupui, 
etc., sketched out with a firm and sure hand the programme and the regulations of 
this new institution. Their wise provisions have been preserved in the school. 
They have served as & model, as a point of departure, for all the attempts of the 
same sort which have been made in France and in foreign countries. It was as a 
result of their advice, for cxample, that the new scheme of instruction was originally 
distributed into three years and divided into three departments or so-called “ offices.” 
No student could pass from ono department to another without passing an examina- 
tion, This council, which has continually maintained within the school its healthy 
traditions, the cause of its prosperity, is still in existence. 
The beginning of the school was happy; pupils began to arrive promptly. One 
can even say without exaggeration that they came from every part of the globe. 
The proportion which has always maintained itself between French pupils and that 
of foreigners showed itself at the beginning, in the ratio of one-third or less of 
foreign students and two-tl c ance. ‘The faculty, well chosen, learned, and 
devoted, knew how to carry out in a happy way the plans adopted by the council, 
and during tho first two years the future appeared to be secure. 
However, misfortune arrived. The charges of the school were heavy, and, in fact, 
high in proportion to the real capital of the enterprise. The continued success of 
the school would have been able to meet this loss, but the current began to change 
before the prolonged difficulties rendered more serious by pelitical events. The 
faculty found it impossible to repair the losses under the circumstances. Faults of 
administration were added, the situation. became each day more difficult, the school 
changed hands several times, and finally came to an end after the revolution of July 
From 1820 to 1830 the Special School of Commerce was under the successive direc- 
tion of MM. Bredard and Legret, its founders; M. Monnier des Taillades, a former 
professor; M. L. Pelleport, a merchant; M. Poux-Franklin, and Adolphe Blanqui, 
directors of studies. 
* * * * % : 
Adolphe Blanqui, who held the chair of history, commerce, and political economy, 
did not fear to undertake, upon his own personal account, an enterprise which up to 
that time had demanded so many victims. 
Adolphe Blanqui was young, without wealth, already a father of a family. The 
times were bad and the future threatening for his enterprise. However, he accepted 
the heritage of ruin with a firm resolution to turn back the current of public opin- 
ion which at that time narrowly followed the so-called ‘protective doctrine of 
national labor,” resolved not to allow an institution to perish which was consecrated

to the diffusion of the principles of political economy and to commercial liberty, to 
which he had already devoted his life. He brought to this useful work an inde- 
fatigable activity, an inexhaustible and charming spirit, a wide experience, and the 
numerous end useful relations which his brilliant qualities and the gracious amenity 
of his character had gained for him. 
Adolphe Blanqui changed the name of the school and called it the “Superior 
School of Commerce,” which name it still bears to-day. He then transferred it from 
the magnificent Hotel Sully to the more modest location in the Rue Neuve Saint 
Gilles. There, as a wide administrator, he could limit the expenses and bring them 
into proportions better adapted to the resources of the moment. Followed by the 
pupils who loved him, surrounded by a small group of instructors faithful to the 
enterprise, he was an example to all of Jabor and devotion. He sacrificed his person 
and recoiled before no obstacle, and all this was done in such a way that in studying 
the history of this struggle, which lasted until his death, more than twenty-five 
years, one does not know which to admire the most—his courage, his activity, the 
variety of his knowledge, the fecundity of his genius, or the charming influence he 
ex ed upon all who came near him. 
The reputation of the institution increased with the growing celebrity of its 
director. The personality of Blanqui dominated it and protected it at the same 
time. Deputy from Bordeaux, elected a member of the institute in 1838, a brilliant 
writer, a popular professor, he threw upon the school the reflection of his own repu- 
tation. He created for it connections wherever his writings were read and appre- 
ciated. He drew upon it the attention of the Government, whose aid he secured for 
it, and the institution was then known throughout the entire world under the name 
of ‘‘Eeolo Blanqui.” 
Another man who was also to acquire a certain celebrity, and to honer the school 
where he had been trained, and to contribute largely to its success was M. Joseph 
Garnier. Twenty years younger than its director, he became his coworker and then 
his partner. His lovely character, his just and kind spirit gained for him the 
sympathies of many by which the institution profited. He remained as a professor 
of the school until his death, almost five years after. Certainly one can say that if 
commercial instruction had found in the numerous economists who have held power 
since 1820 the devotion and stance which these two men of whom we speak had 
given, the destinies of this instruction and consequently the economic condition 
of the country would have been entirely different. It is a great misfortune that men 
did not understand at that time the importance of such instruction, the necessity 
there was of developing it, of extending it, of sustaining it, and we are paying 
dearly to-day for this lack of insight on the part of our governors. 
In 1839 the growing success of the Superior School of Commerce led Adolphe 
Blanqui to transfer it to the Rue Amelot, to the building which it still occupies. He 
could then undertake certain needed modifications which were not possible while 
the school wasin the Hotel Sully. ‘The institution was again to go through a period 
of embarrassment, which, although it did not affect the instruction of the school, 
nevertheless created great difficulties for its director. Finally, after a quarter of a 
century of perseve and courageous struggle, Adolphe Blanqui died prematurely 
in 1854, at the age of 56 years, without seeing the results of the efforts which his 
profound faith in the future of economic instruction had led him to undertake. 
This Keole Blanqui, for one can fairly call it so since it had really become his work 
by virtue of all that he had done for it, was then acquired by M. Gervais de Caen. 
This able administrator, who knew how to improve the financial situation of the 
school and make of it a good business venture, said modestly of his own term of 
office “that it had come like the labors of the last hour, after the greatest heat and 
labors of the day.” He had, therefore, in his own words the easy me: 
of contributing to the solidity of the enterprise which had resisted so many storms. 
He brought to its succor financial resources and the skill of a sound, industrial, and 
commercial administration. 
M. Gervais de Caen, who directed the school for thirteen years—that is to say, until 
in 1867—gave, at least to the pupils whom he had under his care, the future 
hantsand administrators, an example not to be despised, of a good, well-manz 
ness enterprise, thanks to the order and economy of his ma ment, showing 
those positive results which the labor of man ought to produc 
M. Gervais de Caen, moreover, did not apply his habits of industrial and commer- 
cial administration in a way prejudicial to the instruction of the school. He resolved 
to maintain the traditions which he had learned in his work with Blanqui. He 
urged upon the instructing body the loftiness of its mission, demanding of them to 
take the largest possible part in the incessant progress of science and of the specialaid 
which it brings each day to commerce and to industry. Having outlived the storms, 
the Superior School of Commerce certainly achieved under his direction a normal 
rate of advance, reaching each year and oftentimes surpassing the figures fixed for 
its permanent numbers,

  7164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Interested in establishing the necessary discipline for the conduct of the studies, 
which had heen very much relaxed under the direction of Adolphe Blanqui, Gervais 
de Caen has expressed the following opinion resulting from his long experience: 
First, that one can not carry on the instruction and education of young men from 16 
to 25 years without a personal and constantsupervision; second, that in a great city 
like Paris with young men of this age, belonging almost always to families in easy 
circumstances, one can not influence efficiently the day pupils from the double point 
of view of instruction and education. In consequence, and although they were ele- 
ments of financial profit, M. Gervais de Caen did not hesitate to exclude day pupils 
from the night courses of the school, nor did he believe in theisolated work in private 
rooms, and he suppressed this absolutely. This last point of view, which has been 
enforced since that time in the Superior School, and was later adopted by the School 
of Higher Commercial Studies, and also the view relating to the exclusion of day 
pupils and to the necessity of a discipline sufficiently severe to maintain the morals 
of the resident pupils, have appeared to us worthy of production in this place. 
* * # * * * * 
At-his death M. Gervais de Caen, who had no natural heirs, made a will in favor of 
the daughter of predecessor. The direction of the school was intrusted provi- 
sionally to Aimé-G d, who for ten years had occupied most brilliantly the chair of 
chemistry in this establishment. During the last two years of the preceding admin- 
istration and the two years of the provisional administration which followed the 
munber of pupils was not maintained; iteven sensibly diminished. The only school 
in Paris where one could pursue commercial studies found it difficult to keep up its 
numbers; in spite of its brilliant past and its reputation without a rival, it had 
scarcely 70 pupils in 1869. 
Jt was then that the Paris Chamber of Commerce, always solicitous for the inter- 
ests of national commerce, was impressed with the situation. Its president, M. 
Deniére, thinking that such a school would secure a greater prestige in the eyes of 
merchants if it were patronized by the chamber, proposed to his colleagus its acqui- 
sition.. In the session of the 27th of January, 1869, the chamber accepted the 
proposition of the president and authorized him to treat with Mademoiselle Blanqui 
for the purchase of the school and the hiring of the building which it occupied. 
The purchase was made at the price of 120,000 francs, and the rent of the buildings 
was fixed at 25,000 francs per year on the following 15th and 18th of February. The 
first task of the Paris Chamber of Commerce was to select a director of the school. 
It made a choice of one of the professors of the school, M. Schwaeblé, a former pupil 
of the polytechnic school, thus showing its firm intention of maintaining the tradi- 
tions of the school and to raise, if possible, the scientific level of commercial studies, 
which it had just taken under its efficient and lasting protection. The chamber was 
happy in its choice of M. Schwaeblé as director, who saw the number of its pupils 
increase from 70 to 92 in its first year.    
     
           
     During the unhappy war of 1870 and the insurrection which followed the courses 
of the school were suspended. The building, changed into a hospital rendered very 
great servicés, and the faculty proved that it was equal to the most difficult tasks, 
and that it knew how to fulfill jts duty on every occasion. 
As soon as it was atall possible the courses were opened again, and the success of 
the school went on increasing. The chamber, studying the interests of Paris and its 
commerce, and desiring that the sons of merchants of our city should benefit to a 
greater extent by the special instruction of this school, decided in 1873 that day 
pupils, taking a lunch at the school, should be admitted from that time forward. 
As soon as this decision was made the number of pupils increased, and the figure of 
130 was quickly reached and several times passed. Weshould like to go into details 
upon this phase of the school, and its remarkable achievements would furnish us 
interesting descriptions under more than one head, but we must limit ourselves to 
absolute essentials. 
M. Schwaeblé died in the month of July, 1880, some days after the close of the 
school year. He had been present at the distribution of the prizes, and he was said 
to have expressed the wish not to die before the close of the school year. 
The chamber of commerce had to appoint his successor. A former pupil of the 
polytechnic school had served it well, and it was again a former pupil of this school 
which the chamber chose to replace M. Schwaeblé. M. J. Grelley, professor of 
physics in the school and a friend of M. Schwaeblé, was appointed to succeed him, 
This choice was not less happy than the preceding one. Forno person could have 
been better prepared for this difficult function than M. Grelley, nor more capable of 
performing it satisfactorily than he. Formerly a director of an important foundry, 
initiated into practical affairs, a good accountant, M. Grelley bad been long familiar 
with administrative, industrial, and commercial questions. On the other hand, his 
position in the school which he was called upon to direct, the justness and amenity 
of his character assured him the devoted aid of his colleagues. Under the excellent 
direction of M. Grelley, assisted by the counsel of the members of the chamber of

commerce, and notably of M. Salmon, M. Mignon, and M. Piault, the school in the 
Rue Amelot has again seen its reputation steadily increase. i 
To swum up.—The Superior School of Commerce, founded upon an idea the practical 
value of which was contested for a long time, has passed through four very different 
petiods in its sixty-five years of existence. 
The first period, from 1820 to 1830.—This was the epoch of foundation, of groping 
in the dark, of administrative mistakes which led to a frequent change of hands and 
finally to a catastrophe. 
The second period, from 1880 to 1854.—Saved from the ruins; it was protected and 
defended against all difficulties and all attacks by a powerful personality which 
instilled new life into it. 
The third period, from 1854 to 1869.—Superior to every individuality but that of 
the school itself, the management in a certain way impersonal rested upon its early 
traditions and succeeded in maintaining them and showing substantial advance. 
The fourth period, from 1869 to the present.—The apogee of the school—thanks to 
the support of the Chamber of Commerce, to the constant care of its council of 
adininistration, to the happy choice of directors, professors, and examiners, and 
finally, to the firmness of discipline, to the excellence of its curriculum of study and 
the incontestable solidity of its work. 
It has not been possible for us to procure the statistics of attendance at the 
Superior School of Commerce for every year since its organization in 1820, but we 
believe that the number of six thousand is not an incorrect estimate. There were 
1,750 pupils from 1872 to 1885, distributed as follows:

  This diminution in attendance of late years resulted from the competition of the 
School of Higher Commercial Studies, which gives essentially the same instruction. 
The first department is always the most numerous, and it is, consequently, divided 
into two sections. The table below shows the average distribution of the students 
during the last few years:

Foreign pupils constituted, on an average, one-fourth to one-third of the attendance; 
bachelors, on an average, one-twelfth. 
The school has received half residents, or day pupils, only since 1873. Of 1,650 
pupils since 1873, 498 were day pupils, an average of 35 per year.   
Il.—Sussrpizs, ScHoLarsuips, INTERNAL REGULATIONS OF THE SCHOOL. 
—The Superior School of Commerce has never received any subsidy. 
Scholarships.—In 1838 M. Cunin-Gridaine, at that time minister of commerce, 
desired on one occasion to visit the final examinations of the school to form for him- 
self an idea of the value of the work done there. Being well convinced of the 
excellence of the instruction, he conceived the thought of assisting each year a 
gertain number of poor youth, and established some half scholarships, which were 
open to competition. This was the first evidence of interest shown by the Govern- 
ment in commercial instruction. Fifteen years later, on the 8th of June, 1853, M. 
Magne converted the half scholarships into entire scholarships. To-day the State 
upports twelve scholarships for pupils who pass two years in the Superior School of

Commerce. In consequence, at the end of each school year, about the 15th of July, 
six vacant scholarships are open for competition at Paris, Lyons, Marseilles, Toulouse, 
Bordeaux, Rouen, Nantes, Nancy, Lille, and Dijon. 
The sum granted by the ministry of commerce for the aid of pupils, not having 
varied since 1853, is to-day considerably below the sum which they actually cost the 
- school. The latter accepts the situation, however, without complaining, for it finds 
a sufficent compensation for the loss which it sustains in the fact that these scholar- 
ships being open to competition, and the regulations under which they are given 
being administered with absolute impartiality, they are, with very rare exceptions, 
always held by good pupils. 
Conditions of admission to the competitive ceamination.—No one can be admitted to 
the competitive examination unless he shall have shown that he is of French birth; 
that he is at least 16 years of age, and not more. than 20, on the Ist of October of the 
year in which the examination occurs. No dispensation from this provision is 
allowed. 
The candidates who fulfill these conditions must register between the Ist and 15th 
of July, at the latest, at the prefecture of the department in which they desire to 
pass the examination. They must submit certificates at that time relating to the 
birth of the candidate—a certificate of the formalities prescribed by law—a certifi- 
cate of vaccination, end a written declaration indicating the city in which the 
candidate wishes to be examined, also detailed information as to the financial con- 
dition, the number of children and other charges of the parents, as well as an abstract 
of thp taxes paid by the parents. 
Examinations.—The examination consists entirely of written compositions, the 
subjects of which are taken from the course of study indicated below (the course of 
the first year), and sent to the prefecture of the ministry of commerce in sealed’ 
envelopes. Tho examination of the essays and tho classification of the candidates 
are reported to the ministry of commerce by a commission appointed for this 
purpose. 
The compositions comprise: First, a dictation intended to show that the candidate 
can write French correctly; second, a historical or geographical topic; third, a 
test in accounting; fourth, an exercise in arithmetic; fifth, elementary questions in 
physics or chemistry; sixth, an English or German theme; seventh, an elementary 
orien al design in black erayon. (An hour and a half is allowed for cach subject.) 
Regulations of the school.—The school receives resident and day pupils, lunching in 
the dining hall, provided they aro at least 15 yearsofage. No pupil can be admitted 
to the courses of the second year until he shall havo completed his sixteenth year. 
Admission into this division is allowed only after an examination; bachelors in sci- 
ence and bachelors of special secondary instruction are excused from this examina- 
tion. ‘Iho yearly price of board, tuition, and lodging is fixed at 2,000 francs for resi- 
dent pupils who are present at the opening of the year, which ts akes place the first 
Monday in October. “Pupils who remain at the school during the long vacation (from 
tho 3ist of August to the 30th of September) pay a sum, based on the yearly price, 
of 200 francs per month. Special lessons carried on withont interruption during 
the months of August and September prepare the new pupils, and the pupils who 
have fallen behind, for the courses of the following year. ‘The pupils do not wear 
uniforms. They can have a private room by paying a supplementary fee of 100 
francs per term. In Bas for an annual subscription of 100 franes, the pupils 
reccive lessons , fencing, dancing, riding, and boxing. This subscrip- 
tion is obligatory f e WR pupils. f 
Day puy pils.—The da; y pupils lunch at the school. They attend the courses from 
8.30 in the morning until 5 o’clock in the evening, in accordance with the programme 
of studie: 
The price for the day pupils is fixed at 1,000 francs per year for the pupils who are 
present at the beginning of the year. The pupils who follow the courses of the 
school during the long vacation pay a fee of 100 francs for the two months; they do 
not, however, receive lunch during this period. The day pupils can also profit by 
the various lessons in gymnastics, ete., by a payment of 100 franes a year. Tho 
pupils of all divisions, under the g Eines of the management of the school and in 
accordance with the instructions of their family, attend the different’ religious 
denominations to which they belong.

First class.—The Superior Schcol of Commerce is divided into three divisions or 
offices. The entire course of study lasts three years. 
The first office (first year) is, properly speaking, only a preparatory year for the 
more special studies of the following years. This first class is alvays more numerous      
 
-P-A-G-E-843
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 767 
(on an average 60 pupils), and is for this reason divided into two sections, The 
second section, which is preparatory to the first, comprises the most backward 
upils. 
at The first year is given to the improvement of penmanship, study of history, 
geography, arithmetic, and an elementary course upon the usages of commerce, pri- 
mary notions of bookkeeping, also physics and chemistry, in which the students 
study the elements, vocabulary nomenclature, and classification ; further, the cle- 
ments of ordinary legislation and of drawing. Pupils commenee in this year the 
study of foreign languages. Foreigners study the French language, and French 
pupils perfect “themselves in the more detailed study of the rules of their own 
Janguage. 
The division of labor, as shown by tho detailed programme,' implied in a certain 
way the necessity for the first organizers of this instruction to fix a minimum age 
for entrance.. Intelligence and the memory suffice for certain studies; but the study 
of science demands power of attention, reflection, and judgment. In a word, the 
epoch of their development cannot be arbitr arily advanced any more than the devel- 
opment of the brain itself The minimum age of entrance for pupils to the Superior 
School of Commerce was accerdingly fixed “at 15 years. for the first class, and the 
school, as a result of its experience, would be rather inclined to lower than raise this 
age limit. . 
Necond office or ycar.—The second office does not receive pupils under 16, as we have 
said. This provision has been maintained, though not without crea ating each year 
new (difficulties. Tho pupils in general have a marked desire to enter upon the 
second year immediately, Bete troubling themselves as to whether they are in a 
condition to profit by the courses. It is for them, and too often for their parents, a 
question of amour propre. 
The various directors of the Superior School of Commeree have found themselves 
invariably face to face with the difficulty of making those who come forth from the 
factories of baccalaureates understand that the science of commerce is not composed 
of certain formulas which it is sufficient to remember in order to be well prepared to 
make an excellent merchant. These young people are astonished that they must 
work seriously and for a long time in order to learn that which seems to them so 
simple a priori. They would often like to arrive at the advanced parts of science at 
the very beginning; to occupy themselves with finances, with the large enterprises 
of the merchant, with the complicated operations of the exchange, ete. In a word, 
they would like to begin at the end, and to begin with that which can only bo the 
complement of serious studies, leading the pupils by degrees to the possession of a 
positive knowledge which initiates them into the life of affairs. It is easy to see, 
therefore, that one was cbliged to fix a limit of age for entrance into the second 
year, and to institute an ¢ vtion which all pupils who enter it direetly must

far as to be able to make themselves understood in speaking. The language courses 
in the third office are carried on exclusively in the language studied. In the office, 
where the courses of technology and raw materials have an exceptional importance, 
one applies the studies by means of an imitation of the real transactions of commerce ; 
each pupil opens and closes accounts of all sorts, he buys and sells merchandise 
according to the course of the day, carries on a bank, dispatches ships, corresponds 
in foreign languages, devotes himself, in a word, under the direction of an experi- 
enced professor, to the most difficult and varied operations of commerce.! 
Such a plan as the above needs no commentary. We have not hesitated to pro- 
duce it entire in order to show that commercial instruction is not, as its detractors 
pretend, or those who are ignorant of it maintain, a narrow instruction “of the 
earth, earthy ;” an instraction of the shop, but it is in reality a scientific instruction 
at once general and special, directed toward the positive studies which are of use to 
young men who intend to play a rédle in commercial, industrial, administrative, or 
consular careers. 
But if the programme speaks for itself, it will not be superfluous for us to call 
attention to how much devotion, intelligence, experience in practical affairs and in 
education have been necessary since the origin of this school to create, organize, 
improve, and make this programme, in its entirety, to constitute that which one has 
called ‘‘the science of commerce,” especially when one considers the difficulty of 
finding instructors who knew how to put together the materials in which it was 
their business to instruct, for the purpose of their particular training, and in which 
variety was not to exclude the unity of view. 
It would not have been sufticient for the professors to be merely learned, as those 
in the colleges and lycées; it was necessary for their lectures to bear the seal of- 
experience, for the most of them to have been initiated into the life of affairs, for 
them to live or to have lived for a certain length of time face to face with practical 
difficulties arising with every step, and which it was necessary to solve immediately. 
It was only from such men that one could demand that they should give young men 
a training which should lead directly to the practice of commerce. 
To maintain the traditions of useful education while raising its level to the height 
of progress realized in science and its applications; such, in brief, was the work of 
the various managements which have succeeded one another at the Superior School 
of Commerce, and this was a work of no small merit. 
Distribution of the time.—The working day is divided for the resident pupils in the 
different offices as follows: Lecture and recitations, six hours; study, four hours; 
recreation, fiye hours; repose, nine hours; total, twenty-four hours. 
There is thus an average of sixty hours of labor per week, including the study 
hours in the office. The day is thus divided: From 5.30 to 6 o’clock, rising and mak- 
ing the toilet in dormitories; from 6 to 8 o’clock, study in the offices; from 8 to 8.30 
o'clock first breakfast and recreation; from 8.30 to 10 o’clock, lessons; from 10 to 11 
o’clock, lessons; from 11 to 12.30 o’clock, second breakfast and recreation; from 12.30 
to 2 o’clock, lessons; from 2 to 2.30 o’clock, recreation; from 3 to 4 o’clock, lessons; 
from 4 to 5 o’clock, lessons; from 5 to 7 o’clock, dinner and recreation; from 7 to 9 
o'clock, study in the offices.

The courses in each of the three offices are intrusted to a special professor. Each 
pupil must be present at all the courses of the office to which he belongs. The pupils 
take notes during the lectures of the professor, then study these notes in tho offices 
and consult the books at their disposal; write up their notes carefully, which aro 
then collected by the inspector to be submitted to the professor. 
We have estimated that the pupils in tho first office have a total of 900 lessons in 
the course of the school year; those of the second, 911; those of the third, 1,002, 
independent of the lessons in accompl shments, such as dancing, fencing, ete. 
Commercial and industrial excursions.—Just as industrial instruction can only gain 
by becoming commercial, so commercial instruction strengthens itself by becoming 
industrial; consequently, the courses in industrial mechanics, technology, and raw 
materials assume considerable importance in the third office, and in order to reinforce 
the theoretical descriptions of the things which they have studied, the pupils in this 
office make frequent visits, under the conduct of an inspector, to the principal estab- 
lishments of Paris and its environs. These visits are the themes of reports which 
the pupils make to their director upon each of these industries; reports which require 
carerul supplementary studies in hnical works in order to complete the notes which 
they have taken on the spot. It is evident that these weekly lessons, and the studies 
by which they are followed, train in an excellent way the observation and judgment 
of the pupil, by developing at the same time his theoretical and practical knowledge. 
The Chamber of Commerce, always in pursuit of better things, has judged, hoy 
ever, that these Thursday excursions were not sufficient for the purpose. Certain 
industries, and, indeed, some of them very important, are not represented in tho 
environs of Paris at all, notably the extractive and textile industries. The chamber 
consequently decided that each ear, beginning with 1875, the pupils of the third 
office should make a commercial trip, in the month of April, ‘ander the conduct of the 
director of the school. The expenses of this trip, which amount to about 200 francs, 
must be defrayed by the pupils. This trip lasts about three weeks. They go ordi- 
narily into the north of France and into Belgium, where the students study the 
principal factories of cotton and wool; the important coal mines, furnaces, etc. As 
soon as they have returned to the school, the pupils prepare a detailed account of their 
trip, which must be submitted on a given day to the director. These reports are 
in general very carefully prepared. The Chamber of Commerce in establishing these 
industrial trips decided at the same time to grant to the author of the best memoir, 
under the name of ‘traveling scholarship,” the sum of 1,000 franes, which could be 
utilized in making a trip either in France or in a foreign country for the purpose 
of studying some questions proposed to him by the administrative council of the 
school. .We have examined several of these essays, which were printed on account of 
their merit, and each of which reveals truly remarkable qualities of style, of method, 
and of scientific and economic observation. They give marked evidence of the solid 
character and excellence of the studies pursued by the young men who wrote them. 
The titles of a few of them follow: First, a report upon the cotton trade of England; 
second, a report upon the iron and steel trade in Great Britain; third, a report upon 
the trade and manufacture of linens in the British Isles; fourth, a report upon the 
trade and manufacture of woolens in Hamburg, Antwerp, London, and Havre; fifth, 
a report upon the coal trade in the north of France, Belgium, and England; sixth, a 
report upon the manufacture and trade in sugar; seventh, areport upon the silk trade 
and factories in France, Italy, and Switzerland.

IV.—Vaniovus EXAMINATIONS. 
Special examiners test each day a certain number of the pupils in the threo offices 
upon the principal branches of instruction. General examinations are held every 
three months for the classification of the pupils, and immediately thereafter an abstract 
of the marks which each pupil has reeei.ed for his conduct and his work is sent to 
the parents. Reports are, moreover, sent each month to the parents. 
Final examinations.—The final examinations are, in general, conducted by well- 
known men, such as Levasseur and Frederic Passy, members of the institute; Alfred 
Blanche, former councillor of the State; Dr. Gariel, general engineer of roads and 
bridges and member of the Academy of Medicine; M. Le Coeuvre, professor at the 
Central School, etc. 
The pupils are examined separately in the presence of the professor of the subject 
to which tho examination relates. _Each examiner has generally to test one-twentieth 
of the pupils. He employs for this purpose about a day, from which it may be seen 
that the examinations are taken in earnest. 
The relative importance of cach subject of instruction is determined by a coeffi- 
cient by which the mark given by the examiner is to be multiplied. The products 
obtained for the different subjects are then added together, and the pupils are clas 
fied according to the number of points. Thoso who have obtained a sum total cor- 
responding to the averago mark of 12 on the scale of 20 receive a diploma printed 
on parchment, signed by the minister of commerce. The average mark of 12 is not 
easy to obtain, as many examiners mark very low. 
To give an idea of the importance attached to each subject, we reproduce a table 
ere to determine the classification of a pupil who obtained the first diploma 
in : 
The number of points necessary to be obtained for this diploma was 2,568, which 
corresponded to the average mark of 12—that is to say, that it is equal to the product 
of 12 by the sum of the coefficient 214. It was the first time, we believe, that the 
average mark of 18.81 had been reached.

pursue their studies through the third office, and their number amounts to from six- 
teen to twenty on the average. The number of pupils receiving diplomas is natu-

” Certificates.—The pupils of the third office who are not able to obtain a diploma 
receive a certificate of studies, signed by the president of the Chamber of Commerce. 
These are the only certificates which the school recognizes as official; both certify 
the completion of the course; partial certificates are not given. 
Medals.—A certain number of medals are given as prizes each year to the pupils’ 
of the various offices by the ministry of commerce, the Chamber of Commerce, the 
Association of Commerce Geography, and the Tumni association of the school. 
The medals are in gold, silver, and bronze for the third office, and in silver and bronze 
for the second and first offices. One of the prizes given by tho Chamber of Com- 
merce consists of a traveling scholarship of 1,000 francs, of which we have already 
spoken under the heading ‘Scholarships Besides these prizes the ‘ Stenographic 
Institute of the Two Worlds” gives special diplomas to those pupils who are most 
distinguished in the study of stenograph: 
General discipline.-—Tho gencral regulations of the school aro very precise; they 
are not severe, but they are observ ed with care and firmness. Even the form testi- 
fies to experience acquired in the long history of the school; we may mention 
prohibition of reading works relating to other than the subject of studies, card 
playing, etc, 
The pupils who have obtained permission to bo out must return by 10 o’clock in 
the evening during the winter, and half-past 10 during the summer. They present 
for the signatnre of the inspector an exeat, upon which they indicate the name and 
residence of the persons whom they wish to visit, as well as the hour of arriy ing and 
departing; this exeat must bo signed by the parents of correspondents. A noto is 
made of the exact hour of departure and the hour of return of each pupil on each 
occasion that he leaves the building. No students are permitted to leavo the build- 
ing during the working hours. Pupils who do not return at the hour prescribed are 
punished in the following way: For a tardiness of from five to ten minutes a half 
demerit; from fifteen to thirty minutes an entire demerit. The pupil, besides this, is 
deprived of a certain number of possible freedoms, and can even bo expelled. The 
conversation room is open to Pon authorized to visit the pupils every day from 
11 in the morning until half-past 12; in the afternoon from 2 to half-past 2, and from 
5 to 7 in the evening. . Pupils can not be visited except in the conversation room. 
There are als special rules for the studies; the various branches of work; the 
movements within the building; the policing of dormitories and other parts of the 
building, to which the pupils must conform. In the regulations in regard to classes 
we notice that every pupil dismissed from the room of a professor is given an entire 
demerit, and the general regulations say that formal refusal to obey incurs imme- 
diate suspension from the school. The pupils receive special blank books for the 
taking of notes. These blank books are inspected at each recitation by the profes- 
sors and their assistants; the pupils write up these notes for certain courses. All 
bad work must be rewritten on Sunday. Any neglect of work is followed by a cor- 
responding punishment. _ During the term examinations every pupil caught in copy- 
ing any paper is marked and excluded from competition in the general classification. 
Under the regulations relating to studies we notice further some wise provisions 
whose rigid enforcement d clops g good work on the part of the resident pupils, and 
assures very marked superior over the day pupils, whose work suffers in general 
from the too great freedom which is allowed them outside of the school. 
In the regulations concerning dormitories we note tha ast 5 im the morn- 
ing a bell is rung once, as sig a ils :. 5 ock they report 
themselves for study, and y pupil coming in late incurs a punishment, They 
retire at 9 o’clock in the evening. 
The Superior School of Commerce prescribes, therefore, for its resident pupils 
what would be for a workingman a real day’s labor. To the credit of the resident 
pupils it should be noted that the gold medals, the great prizes, and the traveling 
scholarships are almost always taken by resident pupils. 
The regulations of the dining hall say that at the sound of the bell which 
announces lunch or dinner the pupils must come into the refectory, marching two 
by two, in the order of the places which they occupy. Each master conducts the 
pupils of his office. During the meal the inspector exercises a general supervision. 
The regulatio: regard to study prescribe that cach student while remaining in 
his chamber is forbidden to smoke or to read works not relating to his studies. The 
regulations concerning recreation say that pupils may remain in the office or may go 
into the library. They are called in turn and by groups to the gymnasium, to the 
dancing, fencing, and riding halls. ‘The failure to appear in one’s place incurs a 
punishment. §' ng, y' elling, whistling, and shouting are forbidden, and we know 
from the people who reside near the school that the conduct of the pupils in this 
respect is good. Wer add that the supervision of the school is intrusted to five 
supervising masters, an under inspector and an inspector, whose intelligent and 
devoted assistance aid the director in the firm, fatherly application of these vari- 
ous rules.

Penalties.—The punishments which may be inflicted upon pupils are half demerits, 
demerits, and suspension from the school. The director and inspector are alone 
authorized to inflict punishments, upon the demand of the professors or supervising 
masters. The notebooks of the offices and the courses, the reports of conduct, with 
the special notes of the inspector, are submitted each evening to the eyes of the 
director, and give him, combined with the frequent visits in the various offices where 
he teaches himself, a complete knowledge of each pupil, whom he may thus guide 
according to his peculiarities and needs.

       The Superior School of Commerce is administered, as we have already said, by the 
Paris Chamber of Commerce, which delegates its powers to the council of adminis- 
tration, the actual composition of which is given below: President, Jules Piault; 
administrators, Fortier-Beaulieu, Jarlaud, Magnier, Mignon, Salmon, Weber; director 
of the school, J. Grelley. 
Financial condition of the school.—Thanks to the experience, intelligence, and the 
constant efforts employed by the members of its council of administration and by 
the management, the Superior School of Commerce, famous for the solid character of 
the studies which are there pursued, as well as by its exemplary discipline and 
the comfort enjoyed by the pupils, is in an excellent financial condition. 
Without entering into too great detail it will be sufficient to note that the Paris 
Chamber of Commerce purchased the clientele and the furniture of the school for the 
sum of 120,000 francs, in 1869, though it has expended since that time almost 100,000 
franes on buildings, and that not only has the school always. paid its way, but it has 
extinguished the greater portion of the original outlay, while paying an annual 
rental of 25,000 francs to the owner of the property, and not ceasing to give excellent 
accommodations to its resident and day pupils. 
The budget of the school for 1886 is given below. This budget, which does not 
present any notable differences from those of the preceding years, will suffice for the 
purpose:

PERSONNEL OF THE SCHOOL, 
The personnel of the Superior School of Commerce is composed of professors, exam- 
iners, physician, and instructors, including altogether some seventy persons. Such 
men as Levasseur, Passy, and Le Coeuvre figure in the list of examiners. 
VII.—GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 
If we cast a last glance upon the Superior School of Commerce, we shall see that this 
useful institution, which has served as a model not only for France, but for foreign 
countries as well, has never ceased to progress, without, however, leaving the line 
which was traced for it at the very beginning by men skilled in practical affairs, 
celebrated for their scientific labors, and who knew how to recognize the need of 
special instruction for youth destined for the commercial career. It is not unim- 
portant to note in this connection that this school, due to the initiative of MM. Bro- 
dard and Legret, the School Blanqui, the School Gervais de Caen, the School of the 
Chamber of Commerce, directed by polytechnicians, has never varied from its com- 
mercial origin. It has remained a school of commerce, reserved for the preparation 
of superior employees, of trained merchants, of bankers, of managers, of commercial 
directors for industrial establishments, ete. The school has constantly endeavored 
in its career, with a perseverance and unity in view, worthy of remark, to unite 
 
-P-A-G-E-849

general and special instruction, to bind them one to the other in such a way as to 
constitute a homogeneous whole at once classic and scientific, whose parts should 
mutually assist and complement each other, whose distinct courses should be defi- 
nitely related the one to the other, and form a whole like the various chapters of a 
book, the whole, of course, remaining always improvable. 
One fact which proves the intimate and systematic connection of the courses is 
that those pupils who come out of the first office are ordinarily better prepared and 
do their work in a better way than those who, pressed by lack of time or by age, 
enter immediately the second course. One can easily understand that to follow with 
advantage the lessons of the two higher offices there is no better preparation than 
that of the school itself, for the reason that its programmes of instruction are com- 
bined into a single whole for the three years, of which the first parts are visibly and 
strongly attached to those which follow. 
It is in the second office that the instruction, without ceasing to be general, becomes 
more special by the courses which relate directly to commerce. Besides this, in the 
second office the pupils, while carrying on the study of our own language, perfect 
themselves in the study of German and English and choose one of the southern lan- 
guages, Italian or Spanish, in such a way as to learn finally three foreign languages. 
This study of foreign languages (a subject to which one has certainly up to the pres- 
ent not given the attention which it deserves either in schools of commerce or other 
schools) is facilitated in this school of the Rue Amelot, which is in a certain sense 
international in character, by the number of foreign pupils who daily assist the 
work of the professors by their conversations with their French comrades. 
It is in the second office that the mathematical spirit, which must be at the basis 
of every calculation, commences to develop. Here reason takes the place of empir- 
ical methods which tend to arrest the development of intel and the pupils 
treat all the questions which are submitted to them ina rational way. Advancing 
further, the professor must exercise them in tho practice of rapid calculation and of 
mental calculation, whose utility in business is incontestable. The mathematical 
courses are excellently given at the Superior School of Commerce. What an excel- 
lent book MM. Brasilier, Margerie, or Grelley could make upon financial and com- 
mercial mathematics! 
Mathematics and accounting, the pencil and the pen, complement cach the other. 
The course in accounting advances in the second office from elementary work to 
practice. Here one applies the principles of accounting to commerce, to industry, 
and to banking. The professor instructs in the different usages of cities and mar- 
kets; his course becomes a course in commerce; correspondence is carried on in sey- 
erallanguages. Then there is commercial geography, ascience, so to speak, entirely 
modern, and yet of the first importance in economic instruction. 
Parallel with these the students learn, in the course on the history of commerce,     
how, under the vigorous and fruitful influences of commerce, the natural resources, © 
the intellectual wealth of the nations, their political existence, etc., arise and grow. 
At the same time that they are studying the facts in which the commercial prosper- 
ity shows itself at different epochs and at different countries, the pupils have under 
their eyes, in the beautiful museum of commercial products, the natural products 
which are the bases of human exchanges, and the manufactured products which sup- 
port these exchanges. In a word, it is by the combination of theoretical and practi- 
cal lessons that they study the progress of commerce and of industry, that they 
follow its various stages {rom the carliest times down to the present; in a word, that 
they learn to know the economic evolution of humanity. 
But the young merchant must have a just notion of his commercial duties and his 
commercial rights. He mustalso be instructed in the various taxes which are levied 
on merchandise, on exportations and importations; he must understand the mechan- 
ism of the tariff; he must be acquainted with our treaties of commerce with the 
great nations; finally, he can not afford to be ignorant of the organization of our 
system of taxes. lie must understand. their purpose, their necessity, their method 
of assessment and distribution. The courses in commercial and maritime law, sup- 
plemented by those in fiscal and tariff legislation, commercial statistics, etc., fill 
this gap in his education and present him admirably well prepared for the course in 
political economy which begins in the third office, and is the philosophic crown of 
the commercial sciences taught in the school. 
In this body of useful knowledge the physical and natural sciences have also 
found a place and an application. Indeed, how could one give a.good course in raw 
materials without basing it upon courses innatural history, physics, and chemistry? 
In the same way, would not a course in technology require a course in industrial 
mechanics, if it is to be at once intelligible and fruitful? All these branches of 
instruction are closely related, and their practical administratién must be preceded. 
by theoretical studies. Moreover, noblesse oblige, one can not limit one’s self ina 
superior school to the examination, pure and simple, of raw materials and commer- 
cial products. And then, from merely practical considerations, one must teach the

pupils in the second and third offices the chemical compositions of the leading sub- 
stances, the physical conditions under which they are produced, and the mechanical 
principles employed in their various transformations. The merchant of to-day, like 
the manufacturer, must become acquainted with the scientific methods which clear 
his judgment, develop his intelligence, and prepare him finally to discover adultera- 
tions either in raw materials or manufactured products. This scientific part of the 
instruction of the school is reenforced in the third office by the commercial and 
industrial visits made every Thursday to the establishments of Paris and its envi- 
rons, as well as by the annual trip to the north of 'rance and Belgium, where all the 
leading industries are studied, under the experienced guidance of the director. 
Conclusion.—To determine upon the different courses of study, to arrange the pro- 
grammes of these studies, to improve them without ceasing by watching over their 
intelligent development in the classes, by choosing skilled professors adapted to the 
methods of instruction, and by maintaining with a firm hand the necessary disci- 
pline in every direction; all this is without doubt important. But this alone would 
be insufficient to realize the ideas of the Paris Chamber of Commerce and to preserve 
the ancient traditions of the sort of a school which we have heen discussing. Fol- 
lowing a more elevated purpose than even this, the object of this school has always 
been not merely the creation of a scientific body of commercial ruction, but that 
of an economic education based upon moral principles. ‘‘Getrich” is amotto which 
needs numerous corrections. A merchant must be twice honest—honest as a citizen, 
and honest by profession. If nothing is more difficult in the world than to get 
money, nothing is casier than to lose that which one has gained without labor. 
Fortunes which grow too rapidly disappear of themselves. Those which are the 
result of patient labor and honesty are less exposed to adversity, because their pos- 
sessors, more prudent, guard them more carefully from danger. 
We find the motto of this school summed up in the simple words: ‘‘Be good, be 
laborious, be persevering,” pronounced by M. Gustave Roy, then president of the 
chamber of commerce, on an occasion of distributing the prizes of the school. 
“Perseverance,” he added, ‘‘is indispensable to him who wishes to advance. Set 
before yourself a clear, well-defined end; let nothing turn you fromit. Be honest; 
be led on every occasion by that inward light which is called ‘conscience.’ Consult 
it, and when youask it, if it hesitates, abstain. For in all which is right, loyal, and 
honest it will never, believe me, show any hesitation. In regulating your lives in 
this way you will find your reward in the confidence, the consideration, and the 
eredit which you will inspire. A merchant should be honest from calculation, if not 
from the sense of duty.” 
To these counsels full of wisdom, to these words marked with the seal of experi- 
ence, M. Grelley, director of the school, added the following: 
“A condition essential to successin business, I do not fear to say it, isambition. The 
merchant or the manufacturer who desires only a modest subsistence lacks energy— 
lacks the great fire necessary to success. In this age of steam and electricity there isno 
place fortheindolent.. Success is for those who, to the two essential qualities of order 
and economy, add the love of labor and the firm resolution to succeed.” And he 
added, in words not less excellent, ‘I would warn you against a fault unhappily too 
common with young people who aro just starting out in life. Many people have 
what I should call a ‘ clerical’ character; they arrive in the morning at their labor, 
do exactly that which they are directed to do, and wait patiently for that which 
they call the hour of ‘liberty’ when evening comes. For these there is no such thing 
as success; they will remain employees throughout their lives. The employee who 
wishes to succeed must devote himself without ceasing to the affairs which are 
intrusted to him; he must treat them as his own; he must go before the hour of 
beginning work, and finish up in the evening that which he has not been able to do 
in the daytime. This sort of aman is sure to succeed if he adds to these qualities 
order and economy.” 
Commerce oblige is, then, the motto of this school. Honesty is a real force, like 
order, economy, and persevering labor. 
The commerce of France can only increase by the study and practice of probity, 
and it is through such a school as this that such ideas will pass into commercial life, 
and that an cxperimental demonstration will be made that probity is synonymous 
with skill and success.

Tosum up the characteristics of the Superior School of Commerce: It has based 
commercial instruction upon solid scientific instruction. From this point of view 
the programmes of this school are the most complete of any which we have had the 
pleasure of seeing. >A great part of the problem of commercial instruction appears, 
then, to us to have been solved at the Superior School of Commerce at Paris, which 
has had the honor of training, since its foundation, more than 6,000 financiers, man-

ufacturers, superior employees, etc., scattered throughout all the countries of the 
world, and among whom we could namo a large number of eminent men in various 
departments. ° 
VIII.—Tur ALUMNI ASSOCIATION OF THE SUPERIOR SCHOOL OF COMMERCE. 
Origin.—Various graduates of the Superior School of Commerce have attempted 
from time to time te create an association among the alumni of this ancient school. 
But it was very difficult to reknit the broken threads among the members of so many 
generations who had experienced so many different fortunes, and were scattered, 
since the foundation of the school in 1820, thoughout the entire commercial world. 
In 1872, a year which witnessed the rise of an extremely favorable movement to 
schools of commerce, the students of the third office finally sueceeded in forming a 
society. Guided by certain former graduates, among whom was the eminent econ- 
omist, Joseph Garnier, and aided by the counsel of their first president, M. Paul 
Lafitte, they succeeded in creating 2 society, the utility of whose work we are just 
beginning to appreciate. 
Services and progress.—The association, founded by 17 members, includes to-day 
more than 650 members. . The following table shows the annnal increase: 
Year. Members. | ear. | Members. 
    
Tho original association has not undergone any notable change, but each year has 
marked, so to speak, a stage in the moral development of tho society. The purpose 
of the unionis: First, to cultivate the friendly relations formed at the school; second, 
to utilize the relations thus created for the development of commerce and industry ; 
third, to aid former pupils by assisting them after graduation and facilitating their 
finding of positions; fourth, to assist unfortunate comrades. The former pupils of 
the school and pupils in the third office may be members of the union. The annual 
fee is 10 francs; one may become a life member by paying at one time the sum of 100 
franes. The title of ‘‘ Donor” is given to those who pay 200 francs at one time. 
The management is composed of twelve graduate members, and one member from 
the third office. It regulates the disposition of the funds, decides vpon requests for 
assistance, and supervises the publications of thesociety. From the first year of its 
organization the union has granted an annual prize in political economy for the best 
pupil in each subject. 
At its instigation a traveling scholarship was founded by the Paris Chamber of ~ 
Commerce, and given to a graduate of the third year. 
The union also names corresponding members at important points in various parts 
of the earth for the purpose of gathering commercial informatioh. These corre- 
spondents also serve as patrons to those members of the society who havenewly come 
to their respective places. 
In 1876 a quarterly Bulletin was established, which soon became very prosperous, 
and furnished to the members of the society interesting papers upon economiesubjects, 
as well as upon facts relating to the society. This publication has recently become 
amonthly. The society has published, besides, a yearbook since it was founded. 
By the publication of its Bulletin the union has established connections with various 
learned and commercial societies, notably the Geographical Society, the Society of 
Geographical Commerce at Paris, the Scientific Society of France, the Alumni Society 
of the Scheol of Arts and Metiers. 
The banquet, established at the beginning of the society, assembles each year the 
most devoted members of the union. In 1882 its president, N. Detre, invited the 
presidents of similar socicties in Lyons, Rouen, and Havre, founded upon the model 
of that of Paris, to take part in the annual banquet of the union in Paris, or to send 
delegates. It was decided at this banquet to organize a syndicate of the alumni 
society of the superior schools of commerce in France, which furnishes a new proof 
that there is utility beyond the commercial in such societies. 
The presidency of the syndicate of the alumni society is vested in the president of 
the Paris union. It was in this double capacity that M. Deligny submitted in March, 
1884, the demand for 4 new syndical grouping. Accompanied by M. Pathier, a 
 
-P-A-G-E-852
  776 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
former president, and M. René Le Roy, vice-president of the union, M. Deligny was 
called to testify before a parliamentary investigating committee, consisting of forty- 
four members.e He insisted strongly upon the necessity of giving to commercial 
instruction equal advantages to those governmental schools which aro endowed by 
the Government. 
Representations were also made to the ministry of marine to obtain traveling 
scholarships under the same conditions as the society for the encouragement of com- 
merce and industry, and M. Deligny received a formal promise that the State would 
subscribe a sum equal to that which should be subscribed for this purpose by the 
socicties interested. 
In February, 1885, M. Rouvier, minister of commerce, accepted the presidency of 
the banquet of the union, and promised his high assistance to the various purposes 
pursued by the syndicate. 
Among thenumerous evidences of the activity of this alumni society we cite further 
the foundation of the Conference Adolph Blanqui, a society for commercial and 
industrial study, whose purpose is to develop among the future graduates the taste 
for further study and the verbal discussion of questions relating to commerce and 
industry. 
‘The tribunal of Paris, appreciating the good purpose of the Conference Blanqui, 
offered it a place of meeting, which the alumni society did not hesitate to accept on 
behalf of the conference. 
Faithful to its purpose and full of solicitude for its members, the society assists 
them, aids them either in their search for positions or in their commercial careers, by 
means of the numerous relations which are maintained through the various reunions, 
by the publication of its Annual and by its Bulletin, and, finally, if misfortune over- 
takes one of its members the society is always on hand. Moreover, the last word in 
regard to this brotherly side of the society has not been said. M. Deligny proposed 
the organization of a circle which should increase still more the development of 
friendly and commercial relations, and M. Detre then proposed more material reun- 
ions for the same purpose. 
The publication of the Bulletin, as stated above, has just become a monthly. 
Finally, we may say that M. René Le Roy, the present president of the society, has 
submitted to the management a scheme already carried out in part—to form a sort of. 
gener erpaenry. in favor of comrades who are momentarily embarrassed in their busi- 
ness affairs,    
  2,—THE SCHOOL OF HIGHER COMMERCIAL STUDIES IN PARIS, 
I.—HistorY OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE SCHOOL AND ITs SUBSEQUENT 
DEVELOPMENT.    
Tho first idea of the creation of this school should be ascribed to the Paris Cham- 
ber of Commerce, which as early as 1866 took up the question of organizing an estab- 
lishment of higher commercial instruction, complementary to its higher primary 
institution in the Avenue Trudaine. In 1867 the death of Mr. Gerv ais, of Caen, pro- 
prietor and director of the Superior School of Commerce, turned the attention of the 
chamber from the idea of establishing a school, and fixed it upon the purchase of an 
establishment which already enjoyed a universal reputation, and which had become 
a successful business enterprise in the hands of its director. 
We have described in the preceding pages how the Chamber of Commerce got 
possession of the old school of Adolph Blanqui, and with what satisfactory results. 
The idea of establishing a so-called ‘school of higher commercial studies” was, 
however, simply put off by this move and not abandoned. 1t was a subject of con- 
sideration under the presidency of M. Houette, then under that of Guibal, but it was 
under the presidency of M. Gustave Roy that the Paris Chamber of Commerce under- 
took to solve all the difficulties involved in so costly and important a foundation. 
We owe it to historical truth to say that the project of the Chamber of Commerce 
met only a feeble response from public opinion, a thing which should not be an 
occasion of surprise, considering the general feeling in respect to everything con- 
cerning commercial studies, and the marked indifference which our Governments, 
imbued with the old university spirit, have showed down to the very present in 
regard to commercial instruction. Through a learned society, the Oriental Athe- 
neum of Paris, an endeavor was made to stir up an interest in this question in 1875, 
starting from the principle that the business relations of nations are developed as a 
direct consequence of the elevation of their intellectual level. This society in the 
provincial session at St. Eteinne discussed the creation in France of an institution of 
higher commercial studies. Besides this the National Society in Lyons, sharing in 
the same view, resolved to examine this question from all aspects by examining as 
fully as possible into the details of its execution. It even named a special commis- 
sion for the purpose of drawing up a set of questions to be submitted to eminent men 
at home and abroad. 
   
-P-A-G-E-853
    COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. Ot 
Without entering into further details, we must limit ourselves to calling attention 
to the general tenor of the discussion in the Oriental Atheneum of Paris, and to cer- 
tain interesting points raised by the commission of inqniry. 
After having expressed the view that a superior institute of commerce ought to be 
founded in France for the purpose of offering to the graduates of the commercial 
schools, to the consulate cadets, and also to other young people of adequate prelimi- 
nary education, the complementary knowledge necessary to create and consolidate 
new relations with foreign merchants, the Oriental Atheneum defined more especially 
the following as the necessary complement to these studies: 
First, comparative legislation of different nations; second, instruction in the lan- 
guages most used in the great commercial centers of Asia, India, China, and Japan; 
third, courses of philosophy and esthetics as applied to commerce, showing the influ- 
ence of commerce upon the civilization, the ideas, manners, and power of a country, 
and intended to develop in the students those intellectual and moral qualities which 
are capable of dignifying the professional merchant. 
The Oriental Atheneum demanded in addition a course in the history of commerce 
among all peoples, ancient and modern; a complementary course in geography, com- 
prising agricultural, industrial, mineral, and commercial statistics of all countries; 
astudy of the present treaties of commerce; a complete study of the means of trans- 
portation on Jand and water, as also of all the means of correspondence, such as the 
post, telegraph, ete. It also raised the question whether one could not insist that 
the Government should demand of candidates for consulships the diploma of the 
Superior Institute of Commerce. Finally it raised the question whether this insti- 
tution ought to be organized like the Central School of Paris, which takes its pupils 
throughout the entire day, or whether it would not be better if the pupils were 
obliged to be present only at particular courses, as in tho faculties of law and medi- 
cine. Also what would be the best means of controlling and stimulating the work 
of the pupils; how long the course should be; whether the minimum age for admis- 
sion should be fixed at 18; whether the students provided with a diploma at the 
Superior School should be admitted without examination, and whether the degree 
of bachelor should be accepted from those pupils not provided with such a diploma; 
what city of France would be best adapted for the location of such a school; what 
capital would be required; from what source it could be drawn, etc. 
On the other hand the National Society of Education at Lyons proposed the fol- 
lowing questions: 
First, whether an institute of higher commercial studies would be a useful and 
timely complement to the superior schools of commerce; second, whether this insti- 
tution could assist in completing the instruction of consulate cadets and commer- 
cial agents attached to diplomatic missions; third, whether the institution should 
be founded on the principle of freedom of superior instruction, or whether they 
should demand that the State should establish it, or whether it would not be better 
to adopt the mixed system, in which the State should come to the aid of private 
initiative. This society closed its report by expressing the following view: ‘‘The 
National Society of Education at Lyons having heard the report of the commission 
upon the proposal to found in France an institute of higher commercial studies, 
believing that this new organ of instruction would form a happy and even necessary 
complement to the actual organization of superior schools of commerce; considering 
further that it would contribute powerfully to enlarge, elevate, and dignify the 
respective commercial and administrative callings; considering that the principle 
of the plan is not denied and that its timeliness is sufficiently well established by 
the facts produced in the report, and that its realization is not beyond the efforts of 
private initiative, hereby adopts the report of the commission, and charges its presi- 
dent with communicating the same to each of the chambers of commerce in Paris, 
Lyons, and Marseilles, with the request to consult upon the means of insuring the 
execution of the project.” 
The discussion of the various points raised by the members of the Oriental Athe- 
neum of Paris and those of the National Society‘of Education at Lyons, each one of 
which threw some light upon the question, would show it to be very complex. 
Everything goes to show that the view expressed by the Congress of St. Etienne; the 
list of questions which were prepared; the final report upon the answers obtained 
to the questions, and the monograph by M. L. Desgrands, of Lyons, upon the same 
question, have contributed to persuade the chamber of Paris to take the initiative 
in the agitation and to put in execution with its own resources a project which it 
had considered for so long a time. 
FOUNDATION: OF THE SCHOOL. 
In the sessions of the 8th of May and the 24th of July, 1878, tho Paris Chamber 
of Commerce sketched out the plan of the School for Higher Commercial Studies, 
and decided upon the underlying principles. Shortly after the chamber named a 
ED 96 25*  
-P-A-G-E-854
  778 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
commission composed of Messrs.-Jaeques Siegfried, Focillon, and Michau, for the 
purpose of preparing plans of construction for the school, and what was still more 
important, its programme of studies, a function which could not haye been confided 
to more competent men. 
On the 17th of May, 1880, a decree authorized the Chamber of Commerce to borrow 
the necessary money for the construction of the school. Finally, the inauguration 
of the new establishment took place on the 4th of December, 1881, in the great amphi- 
theater of the school under tho presidency of M. Gustave Roy, president of the Paris 
Chamber of Commerce. There were also present Messrs, Léon Say, president of the 
Senate; Rouvier, minister of commerce and of the colonies, and Allain Targé, min- 
ister of finances; and the whole Paris Chamber of Commerce, justly proud of having 
expended over two millions with a liberal hand in constructing a school of com- 
merce, the most beautiful, the most spacious, the best arranged possible; for which 
school its members were happy to do the honors to the parliamentary, administra- 
tive, industrial, and commercial interest of the country. 
Purpose of the school.—The Paris Chamber of Commerce, it is certain, had no inten- 
tion to create a competitor to its own Superior School of Commerce in rue Amelot, 
but desired to found an establishment of another type, a sort of faculty or central © 
schoo! of commerce, to which, as M. Gustave Roy said on the day of inauguration, 
the purpose was to attract young men of family who had completed their classical 
studies. We find, moreover, that the purpose of the foundation of this school is 
+ well defined by the Chamber of Commerce itself in the report which it presented on 
* the 15th of February, 1879, to the ministry of agriculture and commerce, and in 
which it expressed itself on this point as follows: 
“The school is destined, in the thought of the chamber, to give supplementary 
instruction to the children of the bourgeoisie, who propose upon completing the 
college to take up a commercial career. The purpose of the chamber is to give to 
such young men the practical notions of the means by which order and clearness are 
brought into the commercial w orld, whose general mechanism will have been 
explained to them beforehand, and to impress a lofty character upon that instruction 
which comprehends those modern sciences underlying the necessities of international 
commerce.” According to the same report the chamber proposed to organize an 
establishment capable of caring for from 250 to 500 pupils. The first of these figures 
would permit it to cover its expenses at the price of 1,000 francs a year per pupil; 
the second would assure it the necessary supplementary resources for new growth, 
and would farnish it an excess of receipts which could be devoted to further improve- 
ments. 
According to these anticipations, a little optimistic, the necessary grounds for the 
construction of the school were estimated to be about 5,000 square meters. 
Situation of the school.—The School of Higher Commercial Studies is situated at 
108 Boulevard Malesherbes, and occupies a site containing 5,910.99 meters, which the 
chamber purchased at the price of 517,000 francs. Apropos of this action and in 
response to certain criticisms which have been made on the wasteful extravagance 
of the chamber in the purchase of such expensive grounds, it must be said that the 
acquisition of this site was not by any means in itself a bad stroke of business, for 
at the present hour it is worth at least three times that sum, and there is every 
reason to believe that in fifty years, the epoch at which the money borrowed must be 
repaid, the site will be worth at least 2,000,000 franes. It will be sufficient, then, for 
the school to cover its expenses during this period, for the chamber to have profited 
finally to the amount of two millions on this operation, and for its generous action 
to bo converted into a profitable stroke of business. This view is correct, in our 
opinion. 
mee magnificent buildings of the school, the construction of which was open to 
general competition, embrace, besides the rooms of administration, the dwellings 
of the director, of the instructors of studies, ete., 2 grand amphitheaters, 12 study 
halls or offices, 10 examination halls, the museum of products, the laboratory, the 
library, business hall, a large refeetory for 300 pupils, 24 spacious and well-ventil- 
ated chambers for resident students, a hall for sports, large courts, ete. 
Development of the school.—The School of Higher Commercial Studies was opened 
on tho 3d of November, 1881. The increase in the number of students may be seen 
from the following table:

This table indicates a steady growth, which will certainly increase, owing to the 
establishment of a preparatory division, a creation somewhat in contradiction, it 
is true, with the title of the school, but which will certainly be favorable to an 
increase of attendance. 
It will be noticed that the number of foreigners has not increased in proportion to 
the growth of attendance. There may be different opinions upon this subject. We 
believe that the presence of foreign pupils in the French School of Commerce, while 
it shows that the reputation of the school is extended beyond our frontiers, is also a 
condition peculiarly favorable to instruction in foreign languages. 
The pupils for the school year 1885-86 were classified as follows: Preparatory, 15; 
t year, 67; second year, 4 
ly, the number of the pupils at the superior school of Rue Amelot, not having 
been affected by the creation of the School of Higher Commercial Studies, at least to 
the extent which one might have feared, we e conclude that areal service has been 
rendered to the dey: lopment of our higher commercial instruction, which was in 
danger of being hindered from having no place in the only superior school which 
the capital of France possessed. In order to judge wisely of things it is necessary 
to take a high pointof view, and this is what the Paris Chamber of Commerce has 
done in showing itself resolved to wait patiently for the definite results which it 
Duranes and which will be the work of time and of steady effort, and of the growth 
of ideas. 
     
I].—ScHOLARSHIPS—GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL, 
Besides those young people of family, who, having completed their studies, enter 
upon active work, preferring labor to idleness, the Chamber of Commerce desired to 
see in this school also those who, less fav cored by fortune, have the intelligence, 
courage, and the will to advance. It is certain that the mixture of these two ele- 
ments and the good fellowship that is the consequence of intercourse between the 
classes, have always produced the best results. 
Scholarships and semischolarships have consequently been asked for and obtained. 
for the benefit of the new school. The founders are numerous. The ministry of 
commerce and the Chamber. of Commerce have established ten each; one or more 
each have been founded by the following: Le Conseil Municipal de Paris, Ja Banquo 
de France, le Crédit _Foncier, le Comptoir d’Escompte, la Société Générale, le Crédit 
Lyonnais, le Crédit Industriel et Commercial, la Chambre Syndicale des Agents de 
change, l'Union des Banquiers de Paris et de la Province, la Compagnie Générale des 
Omnibus, la Compagnie Transatlantique, la Compagnie du Gaz, le Gouvernement dela 
Guadeloupe, le Département de la Seine-Inférieure, la Chambre de Commerce de 
Phillipeville, MM. Gustave Roy, Dietz-Monnin, A. Poirier, Jacques Siegfried, Ch. 
Noél, Fould, Lebandy, Cousté, Houette, Pestel, and finally, ‘the banking house of the 
Rothschild brothers and Madame Menier, who have given the capital for a perpetual 
scholarship, producing a yearly income of 1 ,000 frances. 
It is interesting to note that the Chamber of Commerce of Phillipeville estab- 
lished a scholarship. This is an example which we are happy to mention in this 
place. We wish that all the chambers of commerce would understand that it is their 
duty to encourage and assist commercial instruction by the establishment of scholar- 
ships in the existing schools of commerce, while waiting for that which would be 
preferable, namely, the establishment of new schools of commerce in their own cities. 
The various kinds of scholarskips.—The school grants official scholarships, private 
scholarships, and remissions of tuition. The official scholarships granted by the 
State and the city of Paris, are so-called external scolarships, open to general com- 
petition for those young people whose parents are unable to pay the price of board. 
The prize scholarships are assigned by the founders to the candidates they designate. 
The remissions of tuition are granted by the administrators of the school; they vary 
from 250 to 500 franes. 
The price of board.at the school, including tuition, is 2,800 franes for the resident 
students; 1,300 forthe so-called ‘‘half-residents” or day pupils. Every pupil who has 
obtained an external sholarship can become a resident pupil by the payment of 1,800 
francs. Every pupil who has obtained a remission of 500 francs can become a resi- 
dent pupil by the paymentof 2,300franes, or aday pupil by the payment of 800 frances. 
Every pupil who has obtained a remission of 250 francs can become a resident pupil 
by the payment of 2,550 frances, or can pursue the studies as a day pupil by the pay- 
ment of 1,050 franes. 
Government or city scholarships.—Those young men, whether bachelors, i. e., gradu- 
ates of lycées, or not, who desire to obtain a Government or city scholarship, are 
compelled to enter into competition. The candidates must be of French birth, and 
have completed their sixteenth year at the time of the examination. Candidates for 
the scholarships of the city of Paris must be residents of Paris. Five Government 
scholarships are put up each year for competition. A notice inserted in the official 
 
-P-A-G-E-856
  780 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
journal indicates the date of the written examination, and is held at the following 
Sides, Paris, Lyons, Marseilles, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Rouen, Lille, Nantes, Nancy, 
and Dijon. 
Vacations.—The vacation comprises about three months each year, from the Ist 
day of August to the Ist day of November. The preparatory class begins a month 
sooner. 
Work during vacations.—During vacations the pupils must prepare, according to a 
plan issued by the school, a paper which represents at least a month’s work, amounting 
to eight hours a day. This paper must be prepared from a point of view essentially 
commercial; technology, the description of machines, must have only a secondary 
luce. f 
B Those papers are considered the best which indicate the sources from which the 
information is drawn; the geographical situation of the establishments visited; the 
names of the persons familiar with the subjects discussed, and those which give 
at the same time the figures relating to production, consumption, importation, and 
exportation of the raw materials or the manufactured products studied. 
Organization of the school.—The school receives resident and day pupils; foreigners 
are admitted on the same conditions as natives. The course is opened on the first 
Monday in November; the length of the course, which, like that of schools at 
Antwerp, Havre, and Bordeaux, has been two years up to the present, will shortly 
be extended to three years. Beginning with the 3d of November, 1885, a prepara- 
tory class was opened for those pupils who wished to prepare themselves to enter 
the first year of the course. 
It is hardly necessary to say that we approve of this feature, which we have 
already praised in various connections in discussing the schools of Havre and Bor- 
deaux. So long as commercial instruction is not systematically organized into 
primary, secondary, and superior schools, the higher schools will have an interest in 
organizing in connection with themselves such preparatory classes as will insure for 
them well-prepared pupils. Such a class has long been a feature of the Superior 
School of Commerce at Paris. 
The cost of board and tuition has been fixed as follows: For the preparatory year 
the price for day pupils is 1,000 francs, plus 300 franes for lunch, which is obligatory; 
the price for resident pupils is 2,200 frances. In the regular course, both in the first 
and second year, the price for day pupils is the same as in the preparatory class; 
that for resident pupils is 2,800 francs. The incidental costs for both classes of pupils 
amount to about 120 francs a year; these are necessary expenditures, even for those 
pupils holding scholarships.    
III.—Instruction, DIVISION OF THE CURRICULUM, DISTRIBUTION OF THE Hours. 
Instruction.—The Paris Chamber of Commerce desires that the instruction at the 
School of Higher Commercial Studies should respond to the needs of modern busi- 
ness, which demand of the merchant a very extensive preparation as well as an edu- 
cation capable of developing in him a feeling of the elevated réle devolving upon 
commerce in the upward movement of civilization and progress. ‘It has seemed to 
us,” said M. Gustave Roy, at that time president of the Chamber of Commerce, in 
his inaugural address at the opening of the school, ‘that commercial instruction 
must be advanced in proportion as science advances. That is why we have founded 
the School of Higher Commercial Studies. For too long a time in France commerce 
has been considered as an inferior career; it is time to protest against this idea, and 
to show that the vocations of merchants and bankers demand as much intelligence 
as any other. It is time for us to impress upon the minds of our youth those truths 
which the previous course of their education has concealed from them. We have 
the faith; we shall have the patience. Just and fruitful ideas make way slowly but 
surely. For our part, as the advance guards of the commerce of Paris, in which the 
commercial and financial life of France is centralized, let us study its wants and 
prepare its future. We have learned in commerce as well as ifi politics to have no 
fear of liberty, and it is in these ideas that the Chamber of Commerce asks its pro- 
fessors to train the youth.” 
It is worth while quoting these words of an experienced man, expressing his own 
opinion and that of the chamber over which he presided, upon a creation which had 
cost enormous sacrifices. In this case words did not precede acts; they followed 
them. The capital of France, endowed with a new and superior school, may now 
say to its friends that ‘the economic education of their children need never again 
be ignored in the difficult struggle which they must sustain. This education is as 
essential to the demands of modern commerce as military education is to that of war. 
We have no wish that you should be any longer deprived of this on account of the 
lack of schools and trained professors. Our former school is full; here is a still 
larger one. Fillit! Show us that we have not outrun the public demand.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-857
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. SL: 
We emphasize the point that the chamber of commerce, impressed with the 
insufficiency of the services rendered to commerce by consuls, and attributing rightly 
this insufficiency to their lack of economic knowledge, has opened in the direction 
of the consulate career a new outlet for the pupils of its schools. We find these 
views squarely announced in the report of M. Gustave Roy upon the programme of 
studies of the school. ‘‘The chamber,” he said, ‘‘ wishes to filla want of the public 
administration in preparing young men who shall be able to represent France in its 
consulates.” It is very certain that with this idea the instruction of the new school 
was reenforced by new courses in law and legislation. 
Programme of studies.—The programme of studies, the very title itself given to the 
school, shows that it was intended to be as advanced as possible. The report of 
M. Gustave Roy sketches very judiciously its great outlines. At every point in the 
detailed examination of the question and constitution of the programme itself one is 
forced to recognize that the programme of studies, tested since 1820 in the Superior 
School of Commerce and recently brought up to the level of modern knowledge and 
needs by M. Schwaeblé, aided by the council of administration of the school, fur- 
nished at almost every point the desiderata of an advanced course. It was, in con- 
sequence, this latter curriculum, slightly amended and strengthened upon the side 
of law and legislation, which was adopted. Without doubt, as M. Jacques Siegfried 
advised in his “‘Memoir,” it would not have been a bad idea for the committee to 
haye studied in addition the curricula of the schools of Antwerp, Lyons, Havre, and 
Marseilles, but for lack of time this was not done. 
The result is, therefore, that the School of Higher Commercial Studies and the 
Superior School of Commerce at Paris instruct in almost exactly the same subjects. It 
is true the organization of the two establishments is different, and cach one has its own 
particular physiognomy which distinguishes it. But that which concerns the public 
chiefly is results. Eimulation has resulted from the rivalry, and this will certainly 
be a benefit. We wish, therefore, that at that time, when the schools of commerce 
shall be organized as parts of a single plan, that there shall be established between 
the pupils of these schools annual competitions upon the theory as well as upon the 
application of the studies to the purposes intended, competition which would permit 
us to judge of the methods and value of cach school to the great benefit of the progress 
of economic commercial instruction. But we shall touch upon this question later. 
Preparatory schools,—The method of instruction in the School of Higher Commer- 
cial Studies is based upon oral lessons in the class room and upon subsequent exam- 
inations relating to the subject-matter of the courses. The length of the course, as 
we have said, is to-day three years. Of it, one year is the preparatory class, and - 
two years are given to the normal or higher classes. 
The programme of the subjects in the preparatory division is fixed by that of admis- 
sion to the first year of the normal course and embraces French, elements of one foreign 
language, mathematics, algebra, geometry, physics, chemistry, elementary natural 
history, history of France, and general geography. This course is common to the 
candidates for admission into the first year of the normal course and to the candidates 
who desire to compete for the day scholarships. 
Normal course—jirst year.—The studies of the first year comprise accounting, math- 
ematics, geography, thestudy of merchandise, commercial analyses, political economy, 
the various branches of law in their relation to commerce, penmanship, and foreign 
languages—one southern and one northern language, at the choice of the pupils. 
Second year.—Pupils continue the study of the subjects begun in the first year and 
take up in addition the history of commerce; budgetary, tariff, and fiscal legislation; 
the study of transportation; the importance of harbors, railroads, waterways, canals, 
docks, ete. Below is given the programme of the studies and the number of hours 
given to each branch. 
This programme offers in its entirety the elements of excellent economico-commer- 
cial instruction, such as we should like to see in the near future in high honor among 
us. For it would quickly form a nursery of young merchants able to develop our 
domestic and foreign commerce at the same time that it would develop for the future 
a solid body of judges prepared for the work of the commercial tribunals of consuls, 
possessing knowledge of commercial affairs and able to render us great services in 
foreign countries; of properly trained teachers and of experienced accountants and 
administrators, of whom we foresee that France will have great need whenever we 
shall determine to apply resolutely a reasonable system and the principles of admin- 
istrative economy to the conduct of the affairs of the nation. 
Distribution of the hours.—In the preparatory class the school day begins at quarter 
past 8 o’clock and closes at half past 4. The day pupils may remain at the school 
until half past 6 to do their work upon paying a supplementary fee of 15 francs a 
month,

IV.—Various EXAMINATIONS. 
Preparatory class.—Candidates who have completed their fifteenth year are admit- 
ted into this division without special examinations, and at any time during the year. 
This class is destined to train pupils for the first year of the regular course. 
Regular course.—First and second year. Those young men furnished with a 
diploma of bachelor of letters or sciences, also the bachelor of special secondary 
instruction, may enter directly and without examination upon the work of the first 
year, No student is admitted directly to the second year’s work. The entrance 
examinations to the first year take place from the 15th to the 30th of October of each 
year in the buildings of the school. This examination is divided into two parts, 
written and oral. 
The written examination consists of the following: First, an essay (one and one- 
half hours); second, a mathematical subject (two hours); third, the translation, 
with the aid of a dictionary, of a French text into English or German at the choice 
of the candidate (one hour). 
The oral examination comprises: First, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry; second, 
physics, chemistry, and natural history; third, general geography; fourth, the his- 
tory of France; fifth, explanation of an English or German text. 
All the subjects comprised in this programme are equally obligatory. Candidates 
whose knowledge upon any one of the subjects is considered insufficient can not be 
admitted. The topics for the written composition can be taken from any subject in 
the programme. A. correct style, a regular and legible handwriting are ectsential 
conditions. 
   
-P-A-G-E-859
    
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 783 
Besides a certificate of vaccination and of certificates proving the age (the com- 
pleted sixteenth year being the lowest year accepted) and the morality of the can- 
didate, those persons who wish to take part in the examination must send to the 
director of the school before the 15th of October a request to that effect upon 
stamped paper, declaring their intentions, and also stating. whether or not they 
desire a day scholarship. After the close of the examination the list of pupils 
admitted is definitely fixed by the council of administration of the school upon the 
proposition of the examining board, and published in the official journal. 
Foreign pupils must farnish references to their consuls. They are admitted to tho 
school in consequence of a special examination intended to determine whether they 
can follow successfully the course of study. 
Special examinations.—The method of instruction in the School of Higher Commer- 
cial Studies is based, as we have already said, upon oral lessons and yery frequent 
examinations. A table posted in the school indicates to the pupils the dates of these 
special examinations, which take place at least twice a week; one upon foreign lan- 
guages, and one upon other subjects of instruction in the programme. 
The rules of the school prescribe that no pupil may be required to pass more than 
three special examinations and more than two general examinations in the same 
week. Two pupils enter at the same timo the office of the examiner. The pupil 
who has just been examined goes out and informs his comrade who stands next to 
him upon the list that his turn has arrived. The examiner assures himself that the 
note books of the subject upon which it is his business to examine are kept up to 
date, that the graphieal and statistical sketches are made with care, and_he puts to 
the pupils who come before him such questions as are intended to ascertain whether 
the lessons in the school room have been studied and understood. He then gives a 
mark which figures in the certificate of the pupil. 
Papers and reports.—Besides their examinations the pupils are required to write 
twice a month a paper or report upon a topic assigned by the management, and 
relating to some subject of instruction in the programme. The subjects assigned 
for these papers are posted up for eight days; they bear the date of the day when 
they must be presented by the student, 
General examinations.—The general examinations cover the entire instruction in tho 
course. They take place at the end of each course. The questions relating to each 
subject are drawn by the pupil by lot. The marks for the general examinations in 
each subject are counted individually, as well as the average of the special exami- 
nations. The general average of the student is based upon the average of the special 
examinations and the marks of the general examinations. 
Marks.—The value of the marks is fixed according to the table below: 
          - Good.    
           Zero (0). ‘ailure. .-- Feeble. 14,15, 1652: 
1, 2,3 -Very bad. | 9, 10, 11. -Passable. | 17, 18, 19. - Very good. 
4, 5, 6. - Bad. Lesteschehore - Fair. 20 - Perfect. 
     Classification of pupils. —The marks obtained in the general and special examina- 
tions serve for the classification of pupils at Easter and at the close of the year, 
periods at which reports are sent to the parents. The classification at Easter is pro- 
visional; tho classification of July serves to establish the passing rank from the first 
to the second year. No pupil can pass from the first to the second year unless he 
has obtained a general average of at least 9. 
The final classification is based upon the combined general average of the exami- 
nations of the first year, which count for one-fourth, and upon that of the examina- 
tions of the second year, which count for three-fourths. To obtain a certificate one 
must have reached a general minimum average of 10. To obtain a diploma one must 
have reached at the end of the second year a general minimum average of 13. The 
report of classification given to each pupil contains, in connection with tho subjects 
of instruction, two columns of marks; the one receiving the general average of the 
special examinations, the other the marks of the general e nations. Tho marks 
appearing in these two columns are added together respectively, and each of the 
sums thus obtained is divided by the number of subjects. The quotient gives the 
average of the total marks of the special and general examinations. For example: 
The quotient of all the special examinations of a pupil is 107 for eleven subjects; 
that of all the marks of his general examinations is 106 for eight subjects, thus 
442 =9.72; 12°—13.25. The general average obtained is the sum of 9.72 and 13.25 
divided by 2, that is, 11.48. The average at the close of the second year is dimin- 
ished or increased by the average of the report of the first year. Example: (Giving 
the average of the first year as 10) [10-++ (3 x 11-48)] ~4— 11.11, the final mark.    
     
-P-A-G-E-860
  784 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
V.—Vanrtous Rewarps, Discipline, DIPLOMAS, CERTIFICATES, AND PENALTIES. 
The diplomas, signed by the minister of commerce, are granted those pupils, foreign 
or native, who have satisfied in an able manner all the tests of the final examina- 
tions at the end of the second year. In August, 1883, 40 diplomas were conferred 
upon a class of 46 pupils; in August, 1884, 39 diplomas were conferred upon a class 
of 51 pupils; in August, 1885, 29 diplomas were conferred upon a class of 49 pupils. 
It is evident that the severity of the examinations for these diplomas is steadily 
increasing from year to year. There is also for foreign pupils a special diploma 
intended to testify that they have followed the courses of the school with success. 
Certificates of capacity are given to pupils of the second year who, although not 
able to obtain a diploma, have, nevertheless, given proof of sufficient’ knowledge of 
the inmost essential subjects of instruction. 
The list of pupils graduated is published in the official journal. There 1s no formal 
distribution of these diplomas, but a simple handing over of the diplomas and cer- 
tificates on the part of the director. This lack of ceremony is not justified, in our 
opinion, by good reasons. Everything which can contribute to dignify the instruc- 
tion, to throw into relief the result of the combined efforts of instructors and pupils 
ought to be utilized for the profit of this instruction, and to increase the faith in it 
on the part of the public. One should have faith in superior commercial instruc- 
tion, and should show that one has faith. This instruction is destined to take an 
official place above secondary gencral instruction, of which it will be a development. 
For the present let us mark for it that place which it has been able to secure. 
General discipline.—The inspector of studies who is present at the various courses 
and at the examinations, devotes himself to all the details of the work of the pupils. 
He is charged, under the authority of the director of the school, with maintaining 
a careful observation of the programme of instruction, and of insuring the mainte- 
nance of discipline among the pupils. He is aided in the accomplishment of his 
mission by the under-instructors to the number of four. 
As a relaxation from mental fatigue the council of the school has decided that the 
pupils should have at their disposal a hall of sports; a billiard hall; a checkers and 
chess-room, as well as interesting reading. ‘Up to ‘the present no restrictions have 
been placed on the various methods of relaxation. Besides this, boxing, fencing, 
and dancing halls enable the pupils to amuse themselves according to their tastes. 
Finally, during the recreation hours, the pupils are authorized to smoke in the hall 
of sports and in the courtyards. 
Punishments.—The following punishments may be inflicted upon the pupils: Half 
demerit, entire demerit, temporary expulsion, reprimand pronounced by the director, 
not in the presence of the council of the school; reprimand in the presence of the 
council, and expulsion pronounced by the couneil upon the recommendation of the 
director. 
The inspector of studies notes all infractions of the rules by the pupils, and the 
reprimands which they have incurred in consequence of negligence or irregularity 
in their work. The council of the school takes into consideration the disciplinary 
marks of each pupil when it makes changes in the divisions, or when considering 
applications for certificates and diplomas. 
    
  
  VI.—ADMINISTRATION, RECEIPTS, EXPENSES. 
The school is administered by the Paris Chamber of Commerce, which founded it. 
It receives no subsidy from the State. 
The most serious efforts and earnest solicitude are employed by the president, M. 
L. Hielard; by the administrators, who aid him with their experience; by the direc- 
tor, M. Jourdan; by the president of the Chamber of Commerce, M. Dietz-Monnin, 
who sits in the council by right of his office, and who rarely fails to be present.at 
its sessions; and, finally, by M. Gustave Roy, in order to insure the development 
and the success of the School of Higher Commercial Studies. The careful study 
which we have made of the progress of this school shows that it has passed beyond 
the difficulties of its early years, and is advancing each year. 
Budget.—The budget of the school is very large, as the Paris Chamber of Commerce 
wished to do a handsome thing, and desired that no expense should be spared to call 
attention to its beautiful creation. Of course, experience can not fail to show reforms 
which it will be necessary to carry out in the modus vivendi of the various depart- 
ments, as well as in the construction of the curriculum andits application. Thanks 
to certain economies which were necessary and which could be carried through with- 
out inconvenience; thanks also to the steady growth of the number of pupils, which 
must be still more marked in consequence of the formation of the preparatory class, 
it is to be presumed that the financial condition of the School of Higher Commercial 
Studies will be sensibly improved from this time on. This, at least, is the view 
which we share, being persuaded that there is room in Paris for two great schools of 
commerce as flourishing as the rue Amelot.

This report differs essentially from the preceding one, as it shows that the school 
is making expenses and receipts meet, without counting, it is remembered, the annuity 
to the crédit foncier, which has been assumed by the Paris Chamber of Commerce 
in consequence of an agreement entered into between the chamber, the city, and 
the State, and a law relating to the construction of a bourse. By this combina- 
tion the chamber, by means of additional hundreds levied upon Parisian commerce, 
finds the necessary means to cover the annuity due to the crédit foncier. 
By alienating the most certain of its revenues and by mortgaging the future for 
fifty years, the Paris Chamber of Commerce, consulting only the dictates of a wise 
patriotism, has not hesitated to extend superior commercial instruction, and to 
attract to it the sons of our merchants. The fortunate arrangement, of which we 
have just spoken, will not impoverish anyone; and Paris possesses, as a result, a 
   
-P-A-G-E-862
786 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
magnificent establishment of commercial instruction, the most beautiful, without 
doubt, in the world. We may surely say here, if ever, ‘‘All’s well that ends well.” 
The director, M. Jourdan, an engineer of arts and manufactures, has been at the 
head of the School of Higher Commercial Studies since its foundation. He had 
formerly been the director of the Commercial School in avenue Trndaine, and had 
there attracted the attention of the Chamber of Commerce. M. Huret, inspector of 
studies, was also 4 member of the instructing body of the Commercial School, 
where he had been a professor for five years. 
The large scheme adopted by the Chamber of Commerce for its School of Higher 
Commercial Studies explains the large number of professors. The faculty number 
forty-four, including seven examiners. The chamber intended that the equipment of 
the new school should fully correspond to its really grandiose plan. It has sneeeeded 
at the cost of Jarge sacrifices, which will he appreciated and which will produce, in 
ouf opinion, the results which the chamber expects of them.   
      VII.—ConcLUSION—NOBLESSE OBLIGE. « 
But certain titles are heavy to carry, and the Paris Chamber of Commerce has 
furnished us anew proof of this. A part of that which has come to pass had already 
been forseen in the interesting report of M. Jacques Siegfried, where he says: ‘‘If 
the Paris Chamber of Commerce should count upon a considerable number of pupils 
atthe beginning it would ran the risk of being deceived. Experience shows that 
if the utility of superior commercial instruction gradually makes itself felt more 
and more, it must, on the other hand, count upon meeting those prejudgments and 
settled habits of thought over which we can not triumph without much patience.” 
With its attention occupied in raising the level of commercial instruction, and 
consequently the prestige of the commercial career, the chamber cherished more 
illusions than M. Siegfried. In fact, M. Gustave Roy, its president, said in the 
inaugural address, from which we haye already quoted some passages: ‘We have 
confidence in our work; it is proposed to draw into this school young men who have 
already completed their classical studies, not those who have not succeeded in the 
colleges, but those who have distinguished themselves there.” 
The immediate future, however, did not justify the views of M. Gustave Roy, for 
the reason that classical instruction never turns the aspiration of its pupils toward 
the commercial career, and the college graduates, notably those who have distin- 
guished themselves, despise commerce and think that they are destined exclusively 
for liberal or administrative careers. 
Thus we see that the necessities of existence turned the school away from the 
strict observation of a rule which would have brought it to an early death of inani- 
tion, and the School of Higher Commercial Studies, which was intended to give only 
superior instruction, has been compelled, in order to replenish its classes, to devote 
itself to secondary instruction. It is this same reason which compelled it to create 
classes preparatory to this latter instruction; that is to say, to introduce a primary 
element in the very institution where the secondary element was to have been 
excluded on principle. 
We have advised this last measure in the interest of the school, and we hope for 
its seecess, In order to insure homogencity in the classes, and with a view of rais- 
ing the character of the instruction, it will probably be necessary to double the 
preparatory year for certain pupils, or to cut this division into two sections. Per- 
haps it will even be advisable to adopt the samo measure for the first year of the 
regular course, so that the second year may really become an advanced course. 
As to the rest, however, we are of the conviction that this measure will be only 
transitory. The future of commercial instruction is assured because necessity com- 
pels it. Under the pressure of economic events whose action on ideas and manners 
is powerful, as-well as under that of better logic, we shall soon see a rapid trans- 
formation in our way of viewing the whole subject of education. A logical reor- 
ganization of general secondary instruction will prepare the youth for the professional 
instruction which they may have chosen, and the schools of commerce, considercd 
on a par with other special schools, will not then be less advanced.     
   
VIWI.—ASSOCIATION OF THE FORMER GRADUATES OF THE ScuooL or HiGHER 
COMMERCIAL INSTRUCTION. 
This association was founded on the 12th of July, 1883. Its place of meeting is at 
the school, 108 Boulevard Malesherbes. This association is primarily a social benefit 
society. It has for its purpose, first, to maintain and create amicable relations 
among the alumni of the School of Higher Commercial Studies; second, to come to 
the aid of former associates who may need assistance; third, to furnish to the vari- 
ous interests of the association information of every kind. ‘In order to accomplish 
these various purposes, first; a place of meeting has been fixed, and these meetings are 
held every week; second, monthly economic conferences and discussions are held by 
the members of the association; third, a quarterly bulletin has just been established,

consisting of four parts, (a) reports of the sessions of the general committee, (b) 
various studies by former pupils of the school, (c) notices of wants, (d) advertise- 
ments for the benefit of the members of the association; fourth, the president can, 
incase of urgency, give immediate pecuniary assistance; fifth, a committee of employ- 
ment is established, charged with aiding their former comrades in the choice and 
obtaining of positions; sixth, asa large number of the alumni have studied law and 
been enrolled as advocates before the court of appeals, a judicial council has been 
established. It gives advice upon all legal questions of interest to the members of 
the association. The idea seems to us excellent. We need lawyers who know how 
to analyze a balance, a liquidation, etc. Lawyers who have taken a course in the 
Superior School of Commerce can hardly fail to be successful. The association is 
administered by a committee composed of 11 members.

MINISTERIAL INSTRUCTION. 
It was not the intention of the committees who revised the programme to avoid 
repeating all the head titles; it is expressly intended each time that the same subject 
should appear in the different courses, but should not be treated by each professor, 
except from the standpoint of the special instructions which he is to give. 
The same distinction should also be present in the mind of the examiners for grad- 
uation, in the quéstions on those subjects which are found simultaneously prescribed 
in the various programmes, 
REGULAR COURSE. 
Commerce and accounting.—Two year: 
lessons. 
Instruction in the ideas of commerce, of arithmetic, and of algebra applied to commerce, 
and of accounting should be simultaneous.—It should be at the same time theoretical 
and practical, and the professors should make use of numerous practical exercises. 
‘The course on the explanations of commerce places under the eyes of the pupils 
specimens of the different commercial documents which they are to study. 
In the lessons on arithmetic and algebra, as applied.to commerce, one part should 
always be reserved for practical exercises in rapid calculation, oral and written. 
The theoretical explanation of accounting should be accompanied, during the first 
year, by the practice of keeping a complete set of books, and during the second 
year by the formation of developed treatises. First year, 120 lessons; second year, 120

    NOT ON THE COMMERCIAL SCHOOLS OF FRANCE. 
Grours.—The French schools of commerce may be divided into two groups. The 
first group comprises seven higher schools, of which two are at Paris and five in 
the provinces. ‘The second group comprises four primary and intermediate schools, 
of which three are at Paris and one in the provinces; a total of eleven schools of 
commerce, 
CONSTITUTION OF THE SCHOOLS.—The Superior School of Commerce at Paris; the 
Commercial School of the Avenue Trudaine, and the School of Higher Commercial 
Studies are all governed by the Paris Chamber of Commerce, which purchased the 
first in 1869 and founded the other two in 1862 and 1881. 
The schools at Lyons, Marscilles, Havre, and the Commercial Institute of Paris are 
controlled by private corporations. The school at Rouen was also created by a cor- 
poration; its capital having been exhausted in 1882, an arrangement was made which 
incorporated the school into the School of Sciences and Letters of Rouen (Academy 
of Caen), in whose hands it now languishes. ‘The method of subsidies was adopted 
in the case of the School of Bordeaux, which was organized in 1874. This combina- 
tion permitted a reduction of the cost of tuition to 200 francs, while giving to the 
school a good location and an excellent equipment. The School of Reims, supported 
by the same method of subsidy as the School of Bordeaux, became a public establish- 
ment in 1882 under the immediate control of the ministry of public instruction, like 
the manual scheol, The Practical School of Commerce and Accounting has remained 
private property. 
If one compares tho value of these different methods of support, one must recog- 
nize that they are allequally precarious. ‘The School of Rouen has foundered for lack 
of capital; the school at Havre manages to exist with great difficulty; that at Lyons, 
founded by a private corporation which seemed to offer more permanence, has about 
arrived at the end of its resources. If the Paris Chamber, of Commerce had been 
obliged to carry for the School of the Avenue Trudaine and that of the rue Amelot 
the same deficits as for the School of Higher Commercial Studies, it is evident it 
would have been obliged to have closed these establishments. As to the School of 
Bordeaux, it could not survive a disagreement between tho three bodies which sub- 
sidized it. Theschool at Reims alone sees its position assured by the aid of the 
State, but it has lost allliberty. So far as an educational point of view is concerned, 
those schools governed by private corporations offer more freedom in instruction. 
Nevertheless, it does not assure as careful supervision as the method of subsidies, 
for shareholders are usually little interested in operations which do not give profits. 
Finally, excellent results have been obtained under all methods, so far as the instruc- 
tion is concerned, but from the administrative and financial point of view the direct 
control by the State would be preferable to the corporation, which is less watchful 
and less attentive, and the form of corporate management is, moreover, rarely fay- 
orable to enterprise. 
CounciLs.—The different schools are administered by councils, composed ordina- 
rily of the prominent merchants of the vicinity. The councils of the three schools, 
supported by the Paris Chamber of Commerce, are recruited from the members of 
that body. Besides looking after the financial administration these committees are 
also charged with supervising the course of study. The council of the school at 
Lyons is composed of thirteen members, of whom four are chosen from the Chamber 
of Commerce and nine from the shareholders. The council of the school at Marseilles 
is composed of twelve members, of whom ten are shareholders and two are members 
of the Chamber of Commerce, and is assisted by an educational] committee founded 
by it, and whose members can be taken from outside the body of shareholders; a pro- 
vision very wise and favorable to good instruction, for it permits the introduction of 
specialists into the council. The school at Havre is administered by a council of 
twelve members, composed of shareholders elected in general assembly. Besides 
ED 96——26* 
     
-P-A-G-E-886
  810 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
looking after the financial administration, it organizes the instruction of the school 
and supervises it. At Bordeaux the administration of the school is confided to the 
Philomathie Society, under the control of a committee of supervision, composed of 
five members of the municipal council, five members of the Chamber of Commerce, 
and a representative of the council general of the Gironde, also five members of the 
Philomathic Society. The Commercial Institute of the Chaussée d’Antin is admin- 
istered by a council of supervision, taken from the founders and shareholders of the 
institute. Finally the Professional School at Reims has a committee of patronage 
and supervision, composed of fourteen members. The Superior School of Commerce 
at Paris, besides its administrative delegation, has an educational council composed 
of twenty-five notabilities and presided over by the ministry of commerce. 
ScuoLarsuips.—In addition to the information which is found in the table pub- 
lished above, we add some remarks upon the pecuniary aid which the State has 
given to commercialinstruction. A ministerial order, dated February 1, 1845,' created 
at the Superior School of Commerce at Paris, directed at that time by M. Blanqui 
sixteen half scholarships of 500 francs cach. By an order of April 23, 1853, these six: 
teen half scholarships were transformed into twelve entire scholarships of 1,200 
francs each. The total expense of 14,400 francs was taken from the grant for the 
encouragement of industry and commerce. 
A special grant for the maintenance of scholarships in the schools of commerce 
was first inserted into the budget for the year 1875. This grant amounted to 30,000 
franes; it was raised to 40,000 francs by the law of 1883. These scholarships are dis- 
tributed as follows:

. SuBsmp1zs.—The subsidies given to the establishments of commercial instruction 
were made from the grant for the encouragement of technical instruction, which 
figured regularly in the budgets since the year 1868. A special grant of 24,350 frances 
for subsidies to the establishments of commercial instruction was inscribed for the 
first time in the budget for the year 1884. For the year 1886 this grant was raised 
to 42,000 francs. These grants were distributed as follows for the year 1884-85:

TRAVELING SCHOLARSHIPS.—The budget for the year 1885, under the head of the 
ministry of commercé, contained a special grant of 9,000 frances for the establishment 
of traveling scholarships, in favor of the graduates of the higher schools of commerce. 
This grant was raised to 18,000 francs by the budget of 1886; the grant asked for at 
1 Some half scholarships had been    ablished ten years earlier. 
   
-P-A-G-E-887
    COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 811 
that time was 50,000 francs. The creation of traveling scholarships answers the 
necessity of extending our ficld. of commercial activity abroad, as well as a just 
requirement from the standpoint of instruction. One must not forget the fact that 
in other careers—in the fine arts, in university studies—traveling scholarships have 
been established at great expense, and that schools have been organized in order to 
enable the graduates to ripen their talent by the study of the works of the great 
masters. 
In Belgium the Government created, in 1862, several traveling scholarships for the 
licentiates in commercial sciences graduating from the Superior School of Commerce 
in Antwerp. Public opinion in France has been favorably inclined to the idea of 
taking a similar step in favor of the graduates of our schools of commerce. M. 
Jacquemart, in an excellent report, has made himself the eloquent interpreter of this 
sentiment, and he has been fortunate enough to gain his cause, Everything points 
to the fact that future budgets will increase each year the grant for these scholar- 
ships. Tho grant in Belgium amounts to 45,000 franes. : 
“When the French State shall decide to follow the example of Belgium, we said 
some time ago, it must not hesitate to increase the number of scholarships. One 
means of creating a large number of them without increasing the cost to the contrib- 
utors would be to transform them into temporary loans made by the treasury, and 
reimbursable under given conditions.” 
We have on several oecasions mentioned this system, which could also be adopted 
by commercial societies or syndicates or insurance companies, This system of loans 
would substitute for a beneficiary a debtor who has taken upon himself certain for- 
mal obligations. 
“The beginning of a commercial career, let us add, ought not to be a gift froma 
society; a capital received and which is not to be repaid; a debt which is not to be 
liquidated. The State should limit itself to making a loan, and tho traveler who 
benefits by the advance should repay it when he shall have succeeded in making it 
bear fruit. This capital would then assist other travelers, who would employ it 
fruitfully in their turn.” 
However it may be with these reflections, we congratulate M. Jacquemart on this 
happy initiative and the result accomplished. The necessary thing was to do some- 
thing. Below is appended the set of regulations relating to traveling scholarships, 
founded by the ministry of commerce: 
ARTICLE 1, A certain number of traveling scholarships will be annually opened to 
competition by the minstry of commerce. These scholarships, of an annual value of 
8,000 francs, are granted for three years. 
Ant. 2. To be admitted to the competition, candidates must produce a certificate 
of good conduct and moral character, and evidence showing, first, that they are 
French citizens either native or naturalized; second, that they are at least 20 years 
of age and not more than 25 at the time of the competition; third, that they are fur- 
nished with a diploma of one of the schools of commerce designated below: 
School of Higher Commercial Studies; Superior School of Commerce at Paris; Supe- 
rior School of Commerce at Lyons; Superior School of Commerce at Marseilles; 
Superior School of Commerce at Bordeaux; Superior School of Commerce at Rouen; 
Superior School of Commerce at Havre; Commercial Institute of Paris; Commercial 
School of the Avenue Trudaine at Paris. 
Arr. 3. Other things being equal, the proof that the candidate has already passed 
one or more years in active busines is also considered. 
Ant. 4, The competition, announced a month in advance in the official journal, 
occurs at Paris from the Ist to the 30th of December. 
ArT. 5. Registrations are received at the ministry of commerce up to the 15th of 
November. 
Art. 6. The competitive examination is divided into two parts: First, a written 
examination; second, an oral examination. The written examination comprises, 
first, commercial geography of the entire world; second, the history of French com- 
merce; third, a composition ina foreign language—English, German, Spanish, Italian, 
or Portuguese. The oral examination includes, first, the commercial geography of 
the entire world; second, French customs legislation; third, French commercial law ; 
fourth, a foreign language—English, German, Spanish, Italian, or Portuguese, at the 
choice of the candidate. 
Ant. 7. These different examinations are conducted before a jury named each year 
by the ministry of commerce. 
Art, 8. The candidates judged worthy of the traveling scholarships will be asked to 
choose their place of residence after consultation with the minister of commerce, who 
will strive to render their sojourn abroad easy and pleasant, by recommending them 
to large French business houses and procuring for them as much as possible the 
assistanse of diplomatic and consular agents. 
Arr, 9, Ths holders of these scholarships must address, each quarter, to the min- 
istry of commerce a study upon the commerce and industries of the region in which 
    
   
-P-A-G-E-888
812 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
they are living. They must add a certificate from the French consul in the district . 
where they are residing, certifying that they are occupying themselves with serious 
studies, with business, and with commercial journeys. 
These regulations suggest some reflections on the diploma which one requires of the 
candidate, certifying that he possesses the knowledge shown in the programmes of 
theschools. We believe, then, thatthe examination is superfluous. It will certainly 
be judged to be so later when the State shall control the schools directly. Butas long 
as the examination is recognized to be necessary, why have they eliminated from the 
test everything which relates to the science of commerce itself, which forms with 
modern languages the basis of the instruction in the schools of commerce? Lawand 
legislation are only auxiliary branches in this instruction. 
Is not the essential rather the commercial knowledge of the sort demanded, attested 
either by the possession of a diploma or by an examination covering the programme 
of the higher schools themselves, and satisfactory statements in regard to the state 
of the health, character, habits of study, intellectual keenness, industry, spirit of 
initiative, fine sense of honor, etc., all things which escape the test of the examina- 
tion? This information could be furnished by the chambers of commerce, and espe- 
cially by the man who had employed the candidate. 
The regulations say further that, other things being equal, the fact that the can- 
didate has already passed one or more years in active business will be taken into 
serious consideration. This provision authorizes, by implication at least, the candi- 
date to present himself without having had any business experience—a thing which 
seems to us undesirable. We should have preferred that, other things being equal, 
practical experience should receive absolute preference, and as a matter of principle, 
considering the actual state of commercial instruction, this practical experience 
ought to be insisted upon in all cases, with the minimum period of one full year. At 
any rate, and let us emphasize this fact, if the foundation of these traveling schol- 
arships is to give the best results regard must be had to the state of health, activity, 
initiative, and moral character of the candidate, and more attention must be paid to 
commercial knowledge than to legal knowledge. 
The holders of traveling scholarships must address, every quarter, a report to the 
minister upon the commerce and industries of the countries which they are visiting. 
This provision is excellent. We believe, however, that one ought to profit by the 
experience obtained in Belgium, where the report of a scholarship holder, demanded 
at one time a few months after the trip, is now demanded only after a full year, so 
that the pupil can make a careful study of the commerce of the country where he 
isliving. ‘Since this provision was adopted,” M. Grandgaignage, director of the 
institute, writes us, ‘‘I notice that the reports are more thorough, and merit publi- 
cation in the consular reports.” 
SCHOLARSHIPS—APPEAL TO THE MERCHANTS.—If the State is thus so far from 
having encouraged commercial instruction, what shall we say of our commerce itself? 
With rare exceptions no person in France has understood the importance of this 
instruction, which must be considered as truly national as that in agriculture and. 
industry, We have shown elsewhere in this treatise that only a few chambers of 
commerce—those of Paris, Lyons, Marseilles, and Bordeaux—have really made sac- 
rifices for the sake of this instruction. What have the other chambers of commerce 
to the number of 103done? Absolutely nothing. Those who have not created schools 
of commerce have not even founded scholarships in the establishments in which 
they ought to have interested themselves, because they are representatives of com- 
merce. Isit not incredible? And what have the syndical chambers of merchants 
and manufacturers done? These number 167 in Paris alone, and they count members 
perhaps by the thousands. Alas! They have not even founded a scholarship, nor 
encouraged in any way the graduates of these schools. Syndical chambers in the 
provinces to the number of 343 have shown the same indifference; they have given 
absolutely no aid to commercial instruction, as absolutely nothing as to the study of 
theology. How about our municipal councils, especially those of the large cities? 
The same indifference, except at Paris, Lyons, Havre, and Bordeaux. And the 
departments, the councils general? The same disregard, except the department of 
the Lower Seine, and that of the Bouches du Rhone. And what of the learned soci- 
eties, and especially the societies of political economy? Again nothing; absolutely 
nothing, except the Philomathic Society of Bordeaux and the Society for the Protec- 
tion of Commerce in Marseilles. Our economists, it would seem, ought to interest 
themselves in something else than the mere development of economic science. A 
certain number of merchants, bankers, and corporations, whose names we have men- 
tioned above, are the only individuals or bodies who have understood the advantage 
of assisting the instruction which aids our commerce directly. 
Let us then take up this good movement and aid it as much as possible. Who 
should assist the work of commercial instruction if not commercial corporations 
themselves? One must not leave the whole burden ef this work upon a few; one must 
not expect everything from the State, which justly asks that you should give the 
example to it which it needs in order to know what one should expect of it.      
   
-P-A-G-E-889
    
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 813 
If we should secure one scholarship from each chamber of commerce, from the 
municipal council of the leading city of each district, from the council general, and 
from the syndical chambers we should have a total of 1,062 scholarships. This 
would not injure any person and our commercial instruction would be immensely 
advanced. It would then take on an extension worthy of such a nation as ours. 
DURATION OF THE sTUDIES.—In the actual state of our schools the three-year 
course is not too long. The School of Lyons has just extended its course to four 
years, of which two years aro preparatory, although lowering, it is true, at the same 
time, the age of admission to 15 years. The two-year curriculum adopted by the 
school at Miihlhausen, at Rouen, Havre, and Bordeaux is too difficult for the major- 
ity of the pupils. Foreign pupils, moreover, have too imperfect a knowledge of our 
language to enable them to follow the course with advantage from the beginning. 
Commercial instruction, very complex in its nature, must strive to develop the 
judgment of the pupil at the same time that it furthers his special knowledge and 
his professional skill. It is for this reason that it must pay some regard to the age 
of the pupils and to the length of the curriculum. The age of the pupils at the timo 
devoted to work play a great réle in all educational matters. We believe, therefore, 
that the schools at Rouen, Bordeaux, and Havre will soon be ready to imitate the 
schools of higher studies and add a preparatory division. 
AGE OF ADMISSION.—At about the age of 14 the pupils in the special secondary 
instruction fnish the studies of the intermediate grade, in consequence of which they 
could enter the schools of commerce, where they would find an instruction certainly 
more profitable for them than that of the superior grades of the special secondary 
instruction. In order to recruit their preparatory classes the schools of commerce 
would find it to their advantage to lower the age of admission to 14. In exceptional 
cases the pupils properly prepared at 15 might then enter the higher school. Those 
who could not pass the examinations with success could spend another year in the 
preparatory class, which would be divided into two sections, as at Lyons and the 
Superior School of Commerce at Paris. 
BacHELoRS.—Those holding a bachelor’s degree are exempt from the examination; 
they may enter directly the first year of the higher school at Lyons; bachelors of 
science and of special secondary instruction enter the second year directly, and at 
Marseilles, likewise provided, they can pass an examination on the subject-matter of 
the first year. 
NUMBER OF PUPILS.—The number of pupils at the schools of commerce has not 
increased in the proportion which one would have hoped from the movement of public 
opinion which manifested itself in favor of commercial instruction immediately fol- 
lowing the year 1870. In 1871 the school was established at Rouen; the following 
year three other schools were opened at Lyons, Marseilles, and Havre. To found 
these four establishments they succeeded in obtaining a capital of more than 2,000,000 
franes by playing, it is true, upon the patriotic feeling then so much excited against 
the foreign element, and which desired to remove it forever from our offices. Butno 
new school was established in 1873. A new one was created in Bordeaux in 1874, and 
with this the development stopped. The enthusiasm for the movement disappeared. 
as the sentiment from which it grew died out. Little by little we returned to our tra- 
ditional indifference. Observation showed that it was much easier to obtain subscrib- 
ers than to create a really permanent movement in favor of commercial instruction. 
The habits of a nation can not be changed inaday. If money isthe sinew of instruc- 
tion, it is necessary that the schools should grow in numbers in order to assure the 
success of this branch of education. The commercial interests of our leading cities 
had subscribed the capital for these schools with very good grace, but everything 
shows that they intended for the present to preserve their children for university 
instruction, counting upon we know not whom to fill the new schools which they 
opened. But when we count upon our neighbors we are apt to suffer cruel losses. 
Statistics show that each year about 450,000 young people enter upon commercial 
or industrial pursuits. To hope that one-tenth at least of this number would attend 
the schools of commerce of various grades was not expecting too much. But statis- 
tics show that we only reached about one-thousandth in the grades of superior 
instruction, and about three and thirty-seventh thousandths counting the pupils of 
primary and superior primary instruction. The public was not slow in grasping the 
situation. Even at Bordeaux, in 1874, it was no longer possible to find subscribers 
to establish a school under the corporate form by the sale of shares. The truth is 
that in all things time is necessary to prepare the public mind for action, and that 
in 1870 we were only superticially and, so to speak, artificially in favor of commercial 
instruction and schools of commerce. If the lesson of our military experience had 
demonstrated and borne in upon the public mind the insufficiency of our general edu- 
cation, the lessons of our economic experience were not yet sufficiently impressed in 
order to show us the insufficiency of our commercial instruction. The recovery of 
business came, moreover, very soon, thus quieting our spirits—ending, it is true, 
by misleading public opinion on the subject entirely. One doubted no longer of 
the commercial prosperity of the country. Why should we instruct our youth in

commerce when commerce was going on so well without it? This recovery of busi- 
ness coming so quickly, we repeated the financial follies of the Empire, which was 
then like a vertigo, which took possession of the nation, corrupted with the ambition 
of becoming rich rapidly without labor. 
To-day things have changed. We are paying for these follies. The lesson has 
been terrible; we now haye time to reflect. And as we see on every side the economic 
progress of neighboring nations we shall recognize that our commercial education 
Jags far in the rear. Everything, then, points to the approaching success of the 
schools of commerce. 
* i t x # * * 
Of 1,488 pupils in the school at Lyons, there were 137 in the silk division of the 
school; the school at Bordeaux had 230 pupils in its industrial division, leaying, 
therefore, a total of 7,053 pupils for higher commercial studies since 1871 and 9,238 
in primary and higher primary instruction. 
Examination of the attendance shows a continued increase in the number of 
pupils in the superior schools during the years from 1872 to 1877. ‘The growth has 
been sensibly slower from 1880 to the present. However, thanks to the creation of 
the School of Higher Commercial Studies, the annual number exceeded 600, begin- 
ning with 1883. In 1886 it was 618, falling, however, to 490 if one deduets the 128 
pupils in the School of Higher Commercial Studies, which would show a diminution 
of about 100 pupils as compared with the years 1877 and 1878. This diminution is 
certainly due to the law relating to military exemption, which did not include in 
the class exempt from the examination the graduates of the schools of commerce. 
We should no longer cast upon these schools a discrimination so marked as it is 
undeserved, for the military examination does not correspond in severity even to 
the final examination of the first year in the higher schools of commerce. If one had 
wished to injure, to hamper, the growth of these excellent schools, one could not have 
chosen a more efficient means. One can scarcely attribute so unjust a discrimination 
to anything else than ill will.! 
In that which concerns the primary and intermediate schools, figures show a con- 
stant growth in attendance. In 1884 the number of students in the School of the 
Avenue Trudaine decreased about 50 in consequence of the competition of the Com- 
mercial Institute, which was so nearly like it, but the following year this loss dis- 
appeared, and commercial instruction, in consequence of the creation of the insti- 
tute, saw the total number of the pupils increased. The Commercial School of the 
Avenue Trudaine has had 8,780 pupils since its creation in 1863. 
ForeEIGN puri1s.—At the Superior School of Commerce in Paris, an establishment 
whose reputation is widely extended, the foreign pupils sometimes form one-third of 
the total number. The School of Higher Commercial Studies had 10 foreigners in 
the year 1886, a total of 51 since its establishment in 1883. At the school at Lyons 
there is an average of 10 foreign pupils, there being 9 for the scholastic year 1885-86. 
At the school at Marseilles the yearly average of foreign pupils is from 25 to 30, 
except during the last year or two, when the fear of cholera has reduced the number 
by half. At the school of Bordeaux there have been 43 foreign pupils since 1874, 
and 44 at Havre since 1880, 11 of whom belonged to the year 1885-86. 
BACCALAUREATE PUPILS.—It is a matter of interest to note the proportion in which 
baccalaureate students—that is, graduates of the lycées—are to be found in these 
schools of commerce. On an average the Higher School of Commerce at Paris has 
from 8 to 10; the School of Higher Commercial Studies has this year 51;? it has 
enrolled 186 since 1883. There are 15 this year at Lyons; from 6 to 8 each year at 
Marseilles; 35 at Bordeaux since 1874, and about 10 at Havre since 1880, 
RESIDENT PUPILS, HALF-BOARDERS, AND DAY PUPILS.—The Higher School of Com- 
merce at Paris has received haif-boarders only since 1873. Of 1,650 enrollments from 
1873 to the present, 1,152 were resident pupils and 498 half-residents, being an aver- 
age of 23. The School of Higher Commercial Studies has this year 52 resident and 
74 half-boarders; the school at Lyons 18 residents and 85 day pupils; that at Mar- 
seilles 15 resident and 97 day pupils. 
Rewarps.—At the end of each year the pupils who have passed the examination 
in a satisfactory manner receive either diplomas or certificates. Gold, silver, and 
bronze medals are awarded in the schools of Paris and Marseilles. At Lyons at the 
end of the second preparatory year the pupils receive a certificate. The diplomes 
oi the Superior School of Commerce and those of the Higher Commercial School of 
Studies are signed by the minister of commerce. 
TRAVELING SCHOLARSHIPS.—Certain schools grant prizes in the form of traveling 
scholarships to the best pupils, imposing upon them the condition of presenting to 
the director of the school a commercial report upon the countries which they have 
  mination has since been removed, and in the last two years, 1892 and 1893, attendance 
has increased at these schools.

visited. At the Superior School of Commerco at Paris, where this prize was estab- 
lished by the Chamber of Commerce, a special topic is assigned to the pupil, who 
must make an extended study upon it. At the school of Lyons the graduate has free 
choice of his subject, as also at Bordeaux. At Havre the traveling scholarships have 
been abolished. 
DieLomas.—At Paris, Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux, and Havre the graduates have, 
up to the present, remained faithful to their chosen career and withont, one may say, 
asingle exception. We believe that this record is unequaled by the pupils of any 
other branch of instruction, and we deduce from this the most favorable conclusions 
both as to the schools themselves and as to the career, which never fails those who 
devote themselves to it, provided they have been properly trained, and are resolved 
to follow the line of good conduct and of persevering labor to which they owe their 
diplomas. What finer eulogy could be pronounced on any branch of instruction than 
to say that none of its graduates have gone to swell the ranks of the discontented. 
There’ is another thing which we must not forget in regard to this commercial 
instruction, and that is that it has led about 18 per cent of its pupils to try their 
fortunes abroad, At Bordeaux, of 93 graduates 16 are in foreign countries or in the 
colonies. At Lyons,-86 out of 400; at Marseilles, 37 out of 230; at Havre, 18 out of 
125; at Paris, 30 out of 233, being a total of 187 educated young men who are devot- 
ing themselves to the development of our foreign commerce. This is a most fayor- 
able result, and speaks well for these schools of commerce, without the benefit of 
whose training these young men would have probably remained in France. 
As to the graduates who have remained at home, they have usually remunerative 
posts, formerly open to foreigners alone. ‘These schools have furnished French mer- 
chants a body of employees, specially trained, whom a few years of practice make 
into exceptionally valuable assistants. 
Unhappily the number of pupils who pursue their studies up to the obtaining of 
a diploma is scarcely 15 per cent, being 1,132 out of 7,369 for the period from 1872 to 
1886. Without doubt this number would have been considerably larger if the diploma 
had been accepted as a ground of exemption from the one-year military service 
examination. 
Prorrssors.—The number of professors yaries from nine at the school of Havre 
to thirty-two in the superior schools of Paris. ‘The salaries are varied in proportion 
to the importance of the course and the number of hours which the professors give’ 
to the respective courses. As to the importance of the courses, they are subject to 
various estimates, according as the instruction in the various schools tends in one 
direction or another. From the point of view of the specialty, it would seem that 
the professors of accounting, of merchandise, and of commercial geography should 
be found among the best paid instructors. But at the School of Higher Commercial 
Studies, for example, where one gives, it is true, not so much time to commercial 
instruction, a professor of accounting receives only one-sixth of the remuneration 
per hour as a professor of law. There are, moreover, many things to be said upon 
this complex question of instructors, which is closely connected with tho definitive 
organization of schools of commerce. We return to this subject further on. 
Of the six superior schools of commerce only three—that of Paris in the rue 
Amelot, that of Marseilles, and that of Havre—have directors who also teach. This 
point will also be discussed later.

The budget for 1886 in the first two columns can be modified in the course of the 
scholastic year. They are made upon estimates based, it is true, upon the experi- 
ence of preceding years, notably for the Superior School of Commerce, whose receipts 
and expenses can be estimated almost exactly. It will be noticed that this school 
pays rent, and practically contributes to the sinking fund. In the budget of the 
second school the rent represented by the annuity due the erédit foncier does not 
figure. The school of Lyons shows a loss, as also that of Havre. ‘The school of Mar- 
seilles shows a surplus. ‘That of Bordeaux is assisted by various subsidies. One will 
find the expenses of the Commercial School given on another page. These expenses 
amount to 120,000 franes, of which 76,000 francs are for salaries. We have no 
information on this point as to the Commercial-Institute. The Professional School 
at Reims expends 61,000 franes for salaries, of which 47,000 are paid by the State, the 
rest by the city of Reims, which also pays for the expenses of the school buildings. 
The Superior School of Commerce more than balances its expenses and its receipts, 
and is thus enabled to contribute largely to the sinking fund. The Commercial 
School of the Avenue Trudaine is also in a prosperous condition. The school of Mar- 
seilles, in the provinces, after having had a deficit for many years on an average of 
11,472 franes from 1872 to 1881, has seen its receipts exceed its expenses in 1882, 1884, 
and 1885. The schools at Lyons and Havre and the School of Higher Commercial 
Studies at Paris regularly show a deficit; that at Bordeaux also; but these losses-are 
provided for in the latter case by the various subsidies. As to the Commercial Insti- 
tute in the Chaussée d’Antin, it is still in the first period of its establishment, that 
of sacrifices, but everything leads us to hope for excellent results in the near future. 
Finally, the school at Rouen is suffering, the school at Reims has just begun to 
grow, and the Practical School of Commerce and Accounting is a profitable private 
venture.   
A COMPARISON OF THE PROGRAMMES OF THE HIGHER SCHOOLS, 
The programmes of the superior schools of commerce possess a uniformly common 
basis of instruction. This is made up of accounting, arithmetic, penmanship, geog- 
raphy, and commercial history, the study of merchandise, French and foreign lan- 
guages, law and legislation relating to commerce, political economy, and the elements 
of the physical and natural sciences. To these general and special subjects of 
instruction almost all the schools have added visits to local industrial establishments, 
and some of them, notably the superior schools of commerce at Paris and Havre, 
take long trips of inspection throughout France and in foreign countries. Finally, 
to answer special wants or local exigencies, certain schools have added other branches 
of instruction. Such, for example, is the course of elocution at the schools at Mar- 
seilles and Havre; the course of equipment at Marseilles, Havre, and Bordeaux; the 
course in the physical, chemical, and mechanical sciences, and the course in drawing 
at the Superior School of Commerce at Paris, and numerous courses in law at the 
School of Higher Studies. 
SPIRIT OF OUR COMMERCIAL TRUCTION.—The instruction, more comprehensive 
at the Superior School of Commerce at Paris and at the School of Higher Commercial 
Studies, is more limited to a narrow specialty in the schools of Lyons, Marseilles, 
Havre, and Bordeaux, where one devotes more time to the practical exercises in the 
commercial offices and less time to theoretical science. 
These two tendencies in fact have shown themselves in the spirit of our commer- 
cial instruction from the foundation of the school at Miihlhausen, whose pro- 
gramme taken from that of Antwerp made a departure from that of the Superior 
School of Commerce of Paris. It is of value to define more exactly the motives which 
have underlain these two contrary tendencies. Those who favor confining the 
instruction to the narrow specialty argue as follows: 
«When @ school has a well-defined end all its instruction ought to tend toward 
this end. Whatever departs from this is taken from the time necessary to the funda- 
mental studies. Without doubt it would be very agreeable to know everything, but 
as one can not study everything one must resolve to limit one’s self. In overloading 
the programme the only result can be that the pupils have studied a little of every- 
thing and do not know anything thoroughly.” 
‘The programmes of the school at Miihlhausen and those of the schools at Lyons, 
Marseilles, Rouen, Havre, and Bordeaux have been constructed in accordance with 
this idea. The opposite line of reasoning is as follows: 
*‘Some have wished the commercial schools to be almost exact representations of 
business offices. For this purpose one has imitated a business house, and the pupils 
correspond with each other like true merchants. As a mere exercise this does not 
seem to be bad, but it is entirely insufficient as a scheme of instruction. One sacri- 
fices theory to child’s play and to a supposed reality which in fact does not exist. 
Is it not a strong deception to believe that you can find, even among the best pupils, 
young men capable of doing real business service at the time they leave school? One 
can certainly not instruct in all the branches of business, Which branches shall one 
           
-P-A-G-E-893
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 817 
choose? At the Polytechnic School, for example, the purpose is to train engineers 
and officers for special departments. One might believe that each group should fol- 
low a course appropriate to the career chosen by its members. But this is not at all 
so. The pupils, without exception, follow the same courses, and in consequence these 
courses are absolutely theoretical. Itis only on graduation from the Polytechnic 
School that the young men enter the schools of application, where they pass two or 
three years, and from which they graduate as engineers or soldiers. Why should 
one take up any other plan in the training of merchants? Is there any reason to 
complain of the results obtained at the Polytechnic School? Are not our engineers 
sought for throughout the entire world? Can not one say without exaggeration that 
most of the railroads of Europe have been built by them? The various branches 
of commerce are more numerous than the careers open to young men leaving the 
Polytechnic School. But there isa body of knowledge common to all these branches, 
and their generality necessarily implies a general theoretical instruction.” 
The conclusion of this line of reasoning is that the schools of commerce must be 
made polytechnic schools, to which business houses shall stand in the relation of 
schools of application. 
* * * * * * * 
  These two extreme methods of regarding commercial instruction have each its own 
value, for they contain each a part of the truth. 
So far as the first line of reasoning is concerned, it is necessary to consider the 
very difficult circumstances under which the schools of commerce, established since 
1870, were placed. It is also fair to take account of the current of opinion favorable 
to the practical instruction which prevails with us, especially in commerce, where 
one denies the efficacy of a purely theoretical commercial instruction. Finally, for 
the class of pupils compelled in great part to leave school for the employment of the 
office or the bank, is it not necessary to attempt to communicate rapidly the knowl- 
edge by immediate use? It was, then, under the pressure of these various influences 
and on account of the necessity of recruiting their classes that the managers of our 
schoolsof commerce have elaborated their programmes, from which they have omitted 
everything which did not seem to be directly related to commerce and absolutely 
essential to its study. On the contrary, at the Superior School of Commerce at 
Paris, attended by the children of merchants in easy circumstances, one has been 
able to work out a three-year curriculum, less elementary, more comprehensive, more 
general; where theory predominates over practice, perhaps to even too great an 
extent, and an effort was made from the very beginning to eetablish a programme of 
studies which, carefully worked out, should not be inferior to-day, from a scientific 
point of view, to that of special secondary instruction. On this fact is based the 
charge that in this school everything is sacrificed to theory. They are, however, 
following a correct view of things, inasmuch as they wish that all special instruc- 
tion should be solidly based upon general instruction. Moreover, so long as the 
superior schools of commerce are aiming to attract graduates of secondary instruc- 
tion they must take care that the latter on entering these schools should not find 
themselves engaged in a course of study a degree lower than that which they have 
completed in the colleges or lycées. 
At Miihlhausen, and later at Marseilles, Lyons, Rouen, Havre, and Bordeaux, they 
preferred to model their schools after the institute at Antwerp, without noticing 
that the examinations for admission into the last-named institution are relatively 
high, and in these schools they fixed from the first the length of the curriculum at 
two years, though it had been established by long experience that three years, of 
which one may be a preparatory year, constitute the minimum period necessary to 
higher commercial instruction, unless the pupils are bachelors of science, or of special 
secondary instruction. The institute at Antwerp itself has added a preparatory 
class, and our schools at Lyons and Marseilles have done likewise. We believe that 
the instruction in our superior schools of commerce must, without distinction, follow 
the example of the school in the Rue Amelot in everything which relates to science. 
A reform of their programmes in this direction would offer the advantage of putting 
them in a position to receive the bachelors of special secondary instruction, when 
the movement of public opinion brings these last to them, a thing which will soon 
happen. 
it consequence of the assimilation of the special baccalaureates and of the classical 
baccalaureates, other things remaining the same, this modification of their pro- 
grammes would also give to the schools of commerce an opportunity of preparing 
for the examinations those of their pupils who desired to join a university degree to 
their diploma. 
* * * * * * * 
But in the eyes of the partisans of practical instruction a good commercial 
apprentice is not necessarily a college graduate; quite the contrary. A good com- 
mercial apprentice, they say, is the man who knows how to cipher well; to keep 
       
-P-A-G-E-894
  818 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
books well; who has good notions of commercial geography; who has learned to 
recognize raw miners and manufactured products; who can reckon up figures 
rapidly and transportation charges; who knows how to cast up an account without 
omitting anything; and who speaks several languages. ‘This is our object,” they 
say. ‘Ours also,” reply the partisans of theoretical instruction. But instead of 
deceiving ourselves as to the value of pretended practice, which can never even from 
an empirical point of view, take the place of practice with real things, we think we 
ought to apply the precious time of the pupils to theoretical studies which have 
become essential to the epoch of scientific progress. A man, they continue, may 
know how to cipher well, know how to keep books well, and still be a most pitiable 
merchant. How often does one see good accountants, who, puffed up by the convic- 
tion that they are the chief cause of the success of the house that employs them, set 
up for themselves after they have made some savings, and become bankrupt in a 
short time. The calling of a merchant demands a complex of qualities which can 
not be acquired at school, and which render it one of the most diffierlt of all. The 
most important of these qualities, which everyone thinks he possesses, but which is 
the rarest of all things, is clearness of judgment. Tho love of labor, order, economy, 
initiative enterprise, scrupulous honesty, commercial sense are also other indispen- 
sable qualities for the merchant. Do you pretend to teach these things? 
  * * * * * * * 
Let us try to sum up the valuable points in this discussion, which dates from 1866, 
the time of the establishment of the school at Miihlhausen and which threatens to 
become eternal. For this purpose let us begin by formulating the pedagogical spirit 
underlying these two methods. 
On the one hend, one has limited the amount of time given to general instrue- 
tion for the benefit of special instruction, and of the professional instruction based 
upon numerous model exercises which we have described under the head of the 
Institute of Antwerp. 
On the other hand, the endeavor is made to strengthen general and special instruc- 
tion, ané the applications of the commercial theory in model offices are limited to 
the minimum, leaving to practical life the work of finishing, from a professional 
point of view, the studies commenced in the school. 
The first question which presents itself to us would, then, be this: Should commer- 
cial instruction give the preference to practice over theory? 
Upon this point, which divides the schools and the opinions of merchants, a 
majority of whom are favorable to practical instruction, we believe there can be no 
difierence of opinion in an epoch of industrial progress like ours, where the level of 
instruction is coming up on all sides, as to its being absolutely necessary to base com- 
‘mercial instruction upon a general scientific instruction as complete as possible. 
Certainly we must have recourse to practical applications, but one must not forget 
that application is simply putting into operation the principles and the rules which 
constitute the science itself. Theoretical instruction must, therefore, have prece- 
dence. Above everything else a commercial school must be polytechnic—that is, a 
liberal school. 
The second question: In what way and to what extent shall technical instruction, 
in practice, be associated with cither general or special theoretical instruction? 
In answer to this question we would reply that the fictitious exercises of the 
model offices are insufficient. Just as one shows to the pupils who expect to be engi- 
neers, farmers, physicians, officers, true mines, true bridges, real farms, real patients, 
real fortifications, real cannons, in the same way one must show and lead the 
pupils in the commercial schools to study real business and commercial houses, real 
accounts, real documents, real transactions. Professional study is limited to science, 
but one does not prepare practitioners without practice, and it is necessary that this 
practice should not be simply fictitious. The school of commerce will be, then, at 
once 2 school of polytechnics and a school of application. 
The third question: Can commercial instruction develop the moral qualities which 
make a good merchant? 
This third point, more delicate than the two preceding, does not, however, give us 
more trouble. One must demand of a good education all that which it is able to 
give. To pretend that the qualities demanded in business could not germinate and 
develop in the commercial school is to place commercial instruction a degree below 
that of our special schools, and consequently to deny the value of this instruction. 
The painter, singer, soldier, priest, missionary, physician follow careers which 
demand, besides the appropriate knowledge, special qualities which the school 
knows how to increase or to beget in the individual. The moral qualities which 
make a successful merchant are in the same way acquired by an education properly 
ordered and methodically pursued. Instruction must always be educative, and just 
as one inculeates patriotism in the soldier, humanity in the physician, self-denial 
in the missionary, the cultivation of science in the scholar, devotion and culture in 
the teacher, love of beauty in the artist, in exactly the same way the aptitude for 
        
 
-P-A-G-E-895
    COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 819 
commercial affairs, a desire for work, the love of order and economy, the spirit of 
enterprise, clearness of judgment, probity—all qualities which make a good business 
man—can be taught in the schools of commerce. It is here a question of the direction 
to be given to the instruction; a question of training, of discipline. 
These are the results which one must try to accomplish, and the means of doing so 
can be found. The self-control of the priest, the bravery of the soldier, the fiery 
oratory of the advocate, even the skill of extemporizing in the case of the artistand 
the poet are the fruit of exercise properly devised and methodically and daily 
repeated. In the same way the qualities of order, of economy, of foresight, of judg- 
ment, of integrity, of equity can also be obtained if one knows how to develop them. 
The commercial sense itself, or the sense for commerce, the sense for business, would 
not be an exception. Besides this, each profession posse a fund of experience, of 
prepared rules and precepts—of trade secrets, so to speak—which is not the exclu- 
sive possession of any one person, and which a good scheme of instruction should 
have and know how to propagate. 
    
  
s » * * * * * 
CONCLUSION.—To sum up the matter of commercial instruction, all the efforts 
must be devoted to develop in the pupil the theoretical and practical knowledge 
and the moral qualities which a business career demands. It will be, then, at once 
general, special, professional, and moral.! 
It will be general by its programme of the sciences; it will be special by the direc- 
tion given tothe pupils about commercial things, by the importance given to the 
study of accounting; of industrial and commercial economy; of living languages; 
of penmanship; of geography; of history; of law; of legislation, and of political 
economy. It will be professional by the careful study of that which goes on in 
business, banking, and commercial houses, where one regards order and_ method by 
practical application and by the study of things. And, finally, it will be moral 
because the work, properly directed, impresses good habits upon the youth, and 
because the economic instruction results in an elevated and morality-producing 
philosophy. 
Critical examination of the actual programmes of study.—Let us take up, then, one by 
one the more important subjects and indicate the modifications which seem to us 
desirable in commercial instruction. 
Accounting.—In examining the programmes of the commercial schools one sees 
that a more and more important place has been assigned in their instruction to 
accounting. It is plain that in doing so they have yielded to the steady pressure 
of public opinion. But were they prepared to fill up the numerous hours given to 
this insruction in a thoroughly satisfactory way? We do not believe that we are 
wrong in saying that even the directors of the commercial schools themselves con- 
sider that the enormous amount of time given to exercises in accounting is out of 
all proportion to the real value of this instruction, and, consequently, to its results. 
It is necessary, then, to make a reform at this point. Must one reduce the number of 
hours given to the study of accounting? Is it not rather necessary to modify this 
instruction and to organize it on a different and more rational plan? It has been 
aecused of oscillating in an uncertain manner between theories badly formulated 
and practical errors upon which the professors base their courses and the fictitious 
books which they require their pupils to keep in the commercial bureau. We believe 
that instruction in accounting should strive to beceme at once more scientific and 
more practical. It must get out of the stationary state in which it is at present. 
We think that while studying seriously the scientific theory the schools of commerce 
would find it to their real advantage to turn their attention to actual practice. We 
should like to see their museums enriched with administrative materials, which, 
methodically arranged by the professors, synthesized by means of their summaries or 
graphical illustrations, accompanied with explanations, should constitute the mate- 
rial for lessons in things relating to accounting and administration. In consequence, 
the greatest effort should be made to enable the professors to carry their instruction 
in industry, banking, commerce, agriculture, and the great branches of adminis- 
tration into the field of practice itself, without being obliged to go outside of the 
school. In this way all the exercises from that of the preparatory class up to that of 
the third year might be based upon the materials of actual business. Moreover, 
during the entire course of the study the pupils should be furnished with documents 
of every sort, the facsimile of real papers referring to the various operations of the 
accountant or manager of which we have justspoken. The collection of thesedocu- 
ments, their distribution in connection with the matters discussed, and the various 
correspondence which they haye occasioned, the keeping of various books relating 
  
  1 The distinction which is hero made between special and professional instruction is not without importance. Special instruction can be given outside of the profession itself; i graft itself upon the instruction given in the exercises of the model or fictitious office. Professional instruction grows out of the practice of the profession itself.

to these operations would constitute an actual lively instruction which would inter- 
est the pupils very much. There would be, in fact, under their very eyes, the 
foundry, the office, the bank, the farm, the great branches of administration, etc., 
less the raw materials, the manufactured products, the cash, plus the demonstration 
of the professor.

We believe it is not necessary to insist upon the value of such an instruction as 
this, at once analytic and synthetic, based upon actualities substituted for the more or 
less fantastic exercises of the fictitious office. After having been initiated into the 
first theoretical and practical notions, the pupil would be able to obtain from the 
programmes, well constructed, at a glance the system of accounting and the various 
branches of any given enterprise. He would follow the foundation and the series of 
operations in examining the books and correspondence relating to them. He would 
understand the purposes of the various documents, their relations to one another, 
their centralization, their results. His attention, at first concentrated upon mat- 
ters of detail, would gradually rise to a conception of the whole. Afterwards he 
would form, little by little, comparisons between the various branches of accounting 
and administration which had passed under his eyes. 
This study would then become an object of a distinct course in comparative 
accounting, in which the professor would pass in review the various methods of 
keeping books used in actual practice; methods whose special advantages and dis- 
advantages he would set forth and discuss from a theoretical point of view. Upon 
a selected topic from real transactions the pupil could be exercised in the practice 
of these various methods—English, German, American, synoptical, logis-mographic, 
ete. Here, also, the different systems of accounting, constructed in accordance with 
these methods, would figure in the museum of the schoo], and would be set forth 
in graphical tables which would synthesize them. Finally, the professor, arrived at 
this point inthe course, could direct his attention to the great systems of accounting 
in mining, metallurgy, sugar industry, transportation companies, farms, banks, 
insurance, and, lastly, public accounting. 
Thus organized and pursued, we believe that instruction in accounting would 
really merit the place which is given to it at the base of economic instruction; that 
it would increase the favor accorded to our schools of commerce, and that our com- 
merce and even the country itself would gain considerably in the near future. 
Commercial and industrial economy.—This course, which we do not find figuring in 
any programme, ought to exist in all the commercial and industrial schools. It 
would find in great part its substance in the materials of the preceding course, of 
which it would be the development and, so to speak, the crown. The professional 
-truths derived from the facts relating to commercial and industrial experience would 
complete its subject-matter. 
“Wherever human industry is developed and concentrated,” says M. Courcelle- 
Seneuil, ‘‘ there a tradition is established. The founders of enterprises transmit to 
their successors these traditions—these devices whose truth their experience has 
led them to recognize, and which one may rightly consider as principles—their 
maxims in commerce, in manufacture, in agriculture, and ineach of the subdivisions 
of these three great branches of human industry.” 
Some of these truths are purely technical in character; others havea higher signifi- 
cance. Oneshould teach the pupils how to become good employees, good buyers, good. 
sellers, good cashiers, good accountants. But the art of buying and selling—that of 
paying and receiving—and that of recording these operations do not constitute the 
whole science of commerce. For a good purchaser, a good salesman, a good cashier, 
anda good accountant would not be sufficient to insure the success of any enterprise. 
It is also necessary that these enterprises be well organized, well administered, well 
directed; and the art of organizing, administering, and directing is based on eco- 
nomic science in this sense, a necessary complement to industrial and commercial 
science. 
Without contesting, then, the utility of courses in political economy, which con- 
tain, so to speak, the general philosophy of commercial instruction, we should like to 
see in the programmes of our schools of commerce a course in commercial and indus- 
trial economy, from which the pupils would derive great professional gain. We 
shall content ourselves here with indicating the outlines of this important course: 
First, of the various kinds of commercial and industrial classification; second, the 
capital necessary for various enterprises, the necessity of determining this exactly, 
the establishment of the business, the study of the laws; third, of merchandise, 
of the raw materials, of the margin of the markets; fourth, of the workmanship, 
of general costs, of gains and losses; fifth, commercial and industrial organization 
and administration; sixth, the importance of accounting in methods of control, 
the exact determination of the selling price, the keeping of inventories; seventh, 
of the conduct of the business, of the material and moral conditions necessary to its 
success, of credit, of the general methods of conducting it, of the means of getting rid   
   
-P-A-G-E-897
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 821 
ofmiddlemen; cighth, corporations—the great branches ofadministration—methodsof 
liquidation, etc. ; ninth, of the duties of the employee, of the merchant, of the agent, 
of the shareholder, of the manager, etc. 
Besides their own personal studies the professors would find excellent help for 
such courses in the following works: Philosophy of Commerce, by M. Stirling; The 
Duty of the Merchant—Conscience and the Science of Duty, by M. Oudat; Commer- 
cial Practice, by M. Devinck; Manual of Business, by M. Courcelle-Seneuil; and 
especially in the excellent treatise on Industrial Economy, by M. Ad. Guilbault, a 
very remarkable work relating to this subject. 
Private economy.—Domestic or private economy is at the base of the preceding. 
He who does not carry order into his personal affairs, in the management of his own 
house, will not find it easy to carry this principle into his business house. If itis 
wrong to expend too much, it is a still greater wrong to expend without keeping 
accounts. Whoever does not keep accounts is doing business on a venture. Who- 
ever keeps accounts reflects or will reflect. Confidence and credit desert the prodi- 
gal. Credit is the nerve of business; a house of any importance can not sustain 
itself by its own resources. 
The future merchant must learn habits of economy and saving, which is nothing 
more than putting into practice the lessons which he has learned. Commercial 
schools have then the duty of developing these habits by obliging the pupils to save, 
and invest their savings, however modest they may be. These savings should be 
evidenced by a savings-bank book, or by the purchase of securities of some sort, or 
by the payments of special premiums which our companies should inaugurate for 
the benefit of the schools. If one should agree to this view, a coefficient of order 
and economy might be introduced into the examination mark, similar to that of in- 
dustry and good conduct. Itis, then, by training the judgment of the pupils and by 
endeavoring to develop in them the professional knowledge and the moral qualities 
of order that schools of commerce will fulfill most completely their educative mis- 
sion and that they will do service to commerce. 
Arithmetic, algebra, and geometry.—Besides being indispensible to the study of 
science, mathematics and notably geometry exercise a happy influence upon the 
reasoning power of man. Instead of desiring to limit this instruction, therefore, 
one must develop it without losing sight of its special application to business. Let 
us ask the instructors to give some time to mental arithmetic, an excellent exercise 
for a future employee or merchant. In theory, arithmetic offers combinations which 
are infinite, a circumstance which the makers of school arithmetics have abused. In 
current practice one is ordinarily limited to operations of simple addition, subtrac- 
tion, multiplication, or division, or to the rule of three. Oneshould train the pupils 
to perform these various calculations very rapidly, as far as possible without recourse 
to the pencil; this sort of skill being very useful and much prized in practice. 
There is a large number of more or less practical processes of rapid calculation, a 
knowledge of which should be tanght to all pupils. 
The instructor should not omit to discuss the different methods of calculating 
insurance used by French and foreign companies and to seize this opportunity to 
emphasize the advantages of insurance for the merchant. In short, we are particu- 
larly in favor of this sort of saving, and our commercial schools should convert their 
pupils upon this subject. We believe, also, thatin return for this useful propaganda 
the insurance companies would not hesitate to form special combinations for the use 
of pupils and the instructing personnel, as well as the alumni association and the 
schools themselves, for which, by means of annual premiums, provided for by gifts 
or by legacies left by the friends of commercial instruction, one could build up a 
capital which would insure their future. Could not one in this way, whether by 
means of gifts, or insurance, or grants, create retiring fees for the personnel of these 
establishments? 
We believe that by taking up seriously a plan of this kind the most excellent 
results could be achieved. ‘Help yourself and heaven will help you” is an adage 
which ought to be in special favor in commercial schools. One accuses our insur- 
ance companies of being merely routinists in their management. Is not the fault 
rather in commerce in general, which by adapting itself somewhat could have com- 
pelled these companies to certain concessions of a nature to render more easy the 
introduction and extension of insurance? For example, why should one not pay the 
premiums in insurance as one pays his taxes? This usage once introduced, the com- 
panies might draw bills upon the insured parties which they could pay through the 
post-office or otherwise. It is easier to pay small sums than relative large annual 
premiums. One would popularize insurance in this way, and render it applicable 
from the school on. We do not care to insist on this subject at this time, contenting 
ourselves with calling it to the attention of the parties interested and to specialists. 
Beginning with the schools of commerce, the habit of insurance, facilitated and 
simplified, would, without doubt, get possession of our entire education, These   
-P-A-G-E-898
  822 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
small insurances, subscribed by the boys at school, would be later converted into 
large insurances, and the cause of insurance would be definitely gained in France. 
The professor of mathematics, as applied to commerce and finances, should also 
give special attention in the third year to the study of the functions of popular 
banks. In France, especially during the last few years, our capitalists manifested a 
tendency, more and more marked, to realize upon the funds invested in industry, 
and to employ them in mortgage loans, national securities, ete. These so-called 
“father of the family investments ” will some day cause the rate of interest on good 
securities to fall below 3 per cent. During this period our commerce will gradually 
decrease. When the obligation of entering upon business enterprises shall be again 
imposed by the necessity of things, even upon large fortunes on account of the 
small rate of interest, we shall be obliged to return to labor, which is the true 
source of wealth. But will it not then be too late? Will not our industries have 
pe ed one by one, and shall we be ablo to resuscitate them again? But if on 
account of the lack of confidence, or indolence, or excess of prudence, the sons of 
the bourgeoisie maintain an expectant attitude, there is no lack among us of men 
who ask only for the opportunity to work, to engage in business enterprise, and cer- 
tainly by means of farms, banks, and popular joint-stock enterprises, we should be 
able to create a new supply of active producers. Ina word, it has become necessary 
to make it possible for intelligent and properly educated men of the lower and mid- 
dle classes to get out of the ranks of wage earners, and to undertake enterprises on 
their own account. 
Capital frowns upon labor, but labor does not frown upon capital. Germany has 
been specially benefited by its popular banks; credit has stimulated its industrial 
and commercial development. - This question of banks is of special interest to our 
future. It is for this reason that we should like the schools of commerce to turn 
their instruction toward practical economy, and the study of the principal questions 
connected with it. 
Among these questions that of the participation of employees and laborers in the 
profits of the enterprises in which they are engaged, deserves to be studied in the 
schools. Profit sharing has already given results which it would be useful te make 
known to the pupils by showing them that it satisfies the sentiment of social justice, 
and that it is an element of stability and prosperity. 
Penmanship.—One must consider penmanship at its real value, giving to it, in the 
eyes of the pupils, the importance which it really has in practice. Finally, penman- 
ship is necessary to the work of the accountant and of correspondents. He who 
possesses a beautiful handwriting—an evidence of taste, of character, and of method— 
possesses an almost certain means of finding speedy employment; his other quali- 
ties will do the rest. We know a number of excellent positions which began really 
with good handwriting. A request for employment, well written, makes a favor- 
able impression upon him to whom it is directed. The commercial schools, then, 
should raise the coefficient of this subject in order to favor a careful study of pen- 
manship. 
Stenography.—The study of stenography ought to be comprised in the programme 
of the preparatory year. One would insure the pupils in this way the ability of tak- 
ing down, without mistakes, the lectures and of getting all the substance out of 
them. It is also of advantage to exercise the young men in expressing their 
thoughts easily by exercises in elocution, as is done in the schools at Marseilles and 
Havre, and those of the United States. But none the less important to train them 
in taking down rapidly the words of others. These two branches complement each 
other. In the United States stenography has become a very lucrative profession for 
both sexes. 
Industrial and commercial geography.—It is no longer necessary to demonstrate the 
advantage of instruction in geograp. 
“Geography,” says M. Rauel Frary, “is the science which contributes most to 
make us educated men; that which procures for him who possesses it the most real 
distinction, the most incontestable superiority in social relations. That which 
enables him to obtain without pedantry the title of ‘learned man.’ Our other 
branches of knowledge,” says he, further, ‘‘disappear for the most part with time, 
but this strengthens and develops itself continually. The books which are the most 
widely read next to novels are books of travels. The well-managed journal is intel- 
ligible only to him who knows geography, foreign politics, colonial politics, political 
economy.” 
“Look at the English journals,” says M. Thierey-Mieg; ‘‘they are principally geo- 
graphical cyclopedias. In each number is considered everything which occurs 
throughout the entire world. Why? Evidently because all this interests the 
English reader.” 
Commercial schools, we are happy to say, have always given a large place in their 
programmes for the study of geography, even exceeding that in classical schools. 
They will perfect this instruction still more. They will see to it that their pupils 
     
    
            
   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-899
    COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 823 
familiarize themselves with the collection and study of commercial, industrial, and 
political maps. Their efforts will be directed toward rendering as attractive as pos- 
sible the study of a science which has always been treated in too dry a fashion. We 
wish that for this purpose they would establish conferences, which might be con- 
ducted by travelers or by the former graduates and subsequent holders of traveling 
scholarships. These conferences might be held in the evening in the lecture rooms, 
and they could be rendered more attractive by the use of the lantern, by maps, by 
prints, photographs, etc. 
The mnseum of the school should have relief maps of the principal countries, and 
its library should contain collections and photographs, history of travels, illustrated 
books, etc. Industry and commerce need to know their field—that is to say, the 
whole world—to give to their efforts the most profitable direction. Geography 
enlarges the horizon of young men; it shows a multitude of careers where their 
activity can find an employment far more profitable than the clerkship or Govern- 
ment careers. 
M. Rauel Frary is right in saying, ‘‘ Let us say to short-sighted people who claim 
that emigration is useless because France is not yet thickly populated, and becan 
we have not yet th rplus population to be sent abroad: Our bourgeoisie, in spi 
of its voluntary sterility, is too numerous. Its children strive with one another in 
Government schools and in the public departments. In order to offer employment 
to this crowd of candidates the Government creates new positions. Far from deliv- 
ering the body social from these parasites the public is even increasing their multi- 
tude day by day. Emigration, whether to foreign countries or to the colonies, frees 
the soil of a useless incumbrance. It opens markets to our national labor. The 
success of those who go increases the welfare and stimulates the utility of those who 
remain. 
The truth of this is proven by what occurs in Germany and Switzerland, where 
for a long time past the study of geography and foreign languages has been steadily 
developed: From this point of view the special secondary instruction of these two 
countries would seem to have for a chief end the training of emigrants. 
Study of railroads, tariffs, commercial and industrial equipment.—This course is 
closely connected with commercial geography. It demands special maps, indicat- 
ing the courses of the railroads, canals, the navigable portion of streams and rivers, 
and the small and great lines of steamboats. These maps to be useful must be 
accompanied with indications of distances, points of departure, the length of tho 
trip, the length of the voyage, ete. One would initiate in this way the student into 
a knowledge of the different tariffs of transportation. They would then learn to 
distinguish between the general, special, and international tariffs of the railroads; 
a point in regard to which so many merchants are in ignorance. They would study 
the different systems of classification of merchandise adopted by the different com- 
panies, and varying with each one of them. They would be shown the advantage 
which is claimed for the application of one operation in preference to another, and 
to direct their shipments by keeping an exact account of tho differences of price 
according to the line adopted. A similar course closed by careful study of the cus- 
toms tariff ought to appear in the instruction of the school in the last year at least, 
and ‘be intrusted to a specialist. The postal tariffs would also be a subject of 
instruction, of the practical study of which an example is already given in tho 
instruction in the Practical School of Commerce and Accounting. 
Finally, to render this study of tarifis as profitable as possible it would be neces- 
sary to place under the eyes of the students all the actual documents used in prac- 
tice, and to imitate shipments of every sort to render them familiar with the subject. 
One will find examples of real operations in the accounting operations of which we 
have already spoken. In comparing the various methods of shipment by post, by 
rail, or otherwise, one would set forth’ the exact differences. The same comparison 
would be made for the different methods of packing for shipment, and the study of 
the different methods of reshipment. In the lessons upon commercial and industrial 
equipment, transportation enterprises, docks, etc., present also matters of interest 
which it is not necessary to emphasize further here, These lessons would be sup- 
plemented to advantage by visits to the shops and factories, and during the Easter ’ 
vacation by trips to foreign countries, under the guidance of a director, as is now 
practiced in the superior schools of commerce at Paris and Havre. 
Commercial and industrial tecknology.—This course constitutes at once a part of the 
general, special, and professional instruction. It should be given, therefore, in all 
three years, becoming more practical in proportion as the pupil advances, and finally 
ending in a comparative study of the means of transportation, tariffs, commercial 
and industrial equipment. 
Raw and manufactured products.—A preliminary knowledge of the physical and 
chemical qualities of products will be acquired in the laboratory and in the sample 
museums of the school. Theoretical study, therefore, will form the beginning of 
this important course. The pupils will consequently be trained to distinguish the   
      
-P-A-G-E-900
  824 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
different types of raw materials and of manufactured products and to recognize 
their essential qualities, their forms of production, and their value. . They will be 
given general explanations as to the different processes of production, extraction, 
and manufacture. Tho various adulterations will be explained to them, and they 
will learn to distinguish products little by little, either by sight, taste, touch, reac- 
tions, chemical analyses, or by microscopical investigations. 
In the museum of tho school general graphical tables will indicate the various 
forms of raw products, of the raw material, of colonial commodities classified in 
series. ‘They will give general indications as to the commercial quality of the prod- 
ucts. These tables will refer to geographical maps, where will be indicated by 
colors the zones of production and the annual value of theirexportation. Explana- 
tory remarks in the margin of these maps will complete the commercial information 
and give useful statistics. The tables showing the production of cotton, silk, wool, 
sugar, coal, various metals, seeds, cereals will be well completed by diagrams indi- 
cating the variations in price of the most important mercantile commodities, This 
course, essentially practical, constituting the conclusion of the courses in physics, 
chemistry, mechanics, commercial and industrial geography, technology, etc., should 
not be limited to the explanations and manipulations in the laboratories and 
museums, and it is for this reason that the various schools of commerce have adopted, 
in a more or less intermittent form, the system of industrial visits, which, of them- 
selves, seem to us insufficient. However wise the professor of technology may be 
who conducts the pupils into industrial establishments, he is often obliged to con- 
tent himself with generalities. Each branch of industry has its trade secrets, which 
are continually modified. The encyclopedias and special treatises must constantly 
keep in touch with the practice. ‘The pupil, then, after having arrived at a certain 
stage of knowledge, would get more advantage from conferences conducted by spe- 
cialists in the different industries. These conferences should commence in the very 
first year of the regular course; they would take place in the shops and even in the 
factories of such manufacturers as would consent to do so. One would pass then in 
review the different industries—silk, ceramics, glassware, materials of construction, 
paper, pasteboard, chemical products, furniture, metals, leather, and hides. 
The art of buying and sellin -Aside from the professional skill which is the result 
of the personal ability and_ experience of a merchant, the art of buying and selling 
conforms to certain principles which can be taught in the school. The various ele- 
ments of the curriculum of the commercial school should converge toward one end— 
to make merchants; and it would be surprising if this instruction were to stop at 
tho very threshold of the culminating point of the science of commerce. Moreover, 
the operations of purchase and sale, carried on in a manner to leave a profit, a just 
remuneration for capital, labor, and the service which the merchant renders, pre- 
supposes a knowledge of arithmetic and accounting which enables him to fix the 
price at which things must be resold in order to yield a profit, as well as a knowl- 
edge of the market—its wants, its extent—and also of merchandise itself. The same 
operations carried on with foreign countries necessitate, moreover, the knowledge 
ot foreign languages, of commercial usages, and of monetary systems. All these 
branches of knowledge, and others also, constitute a part of the programme of com- 
mercial instruction, comprising, moreover, the mechanism of the great speculation 
markets. What remains, then, to teach the pupil? 
The art of earning money, like that of winning a battle, must be tested in the 
field. But to win battles it is necessary to have studied tactics and strategy, and 
the various branches of knowledge relating to these subjects. We may then learn 
commercial tactics and strategy from former merchants who have retired from busi- 
ness and are willing to devote the substance of that which they know for the 
instruction of young merchants. The results of their personal observation, the 
experience which they have gained from others, that which they have themselves 
acquired, these merchants might impart in a general way, or as they relate to cer- 
tain branches of business. This course, which would not be the least interesting of 
those which we have described, would form the clement of a technological confer- 
ence of which we have already spoken above, as well as the course in commercial 
and industrial economy. 
Marine equipment.—This course corresponds to certain local wants. It is given at 
three schools—at Marseilles, Havre, and Bordeaux. One must take care that this 
course is not extended unduly and shall not become a course in naval architecture, 
which would be superfluous and could hardly be considered a part of commercial 
instruction. 
French language.—The work in the French language should be completed in the 
preparatory class. In the upper classes the pupils should occupy themselves with 
literature, history, reading, outlines of literary history, etc. This part of the 
instruction would relieve the minds of the pupils from the severe tension which the 
positive instruction requires. The merchant of to-day, moreover, ought not to be a 
stranger in the literary field. 
   
-P-A-G-E-901
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 825 
Another reason, based on physiology, would require such instruction as this. 
Man is rather formed for action and contemplation, for physical exercise or for 
poetry, than for analysis and scientific abstraction. For this reason we would 
include gymnastics and literature in the economic curriculum, as well as music, 
which is a form of poetry at the same time that it is an education of the senses. 
Monthly literary conferences should be held in the evenings, concurrently with the 
conferences in commercial geography. In these might be treated especially the 
literature of the different nations and the more important recent additions to liter- 
ature. Finally, the study of French, besides being the occasion of numerous oral 
exercises, which should train the style of the students, would be a good opportunity 
for commercial essays or abstracts of certain courses and accounts of the Thursday 
visits. Each pupil should be obliged to have his book of essays relating to things 
done outside of the school. 
Foreign languages.—We have already indicated certain modifications which, in 
our opinion, ought to be introduced into the instruction in foreign languages in our 
commercial schools, an instruction which, up to the present, has been modeled too 
exclusively upon that of the classical languages. Is it by reading the classic authors 
to her child that a mother teaches it to understand the persons who speak to it and 
to make itself understood by them? A child of 5 years of age has no idea of rules 
of grammar, while it may employ fluently and correctly a large number of words 
and phrases to express its thought at this age; it may already speak several lan- 
guages. In Russia, Poland, Greece, Egypt, and Denmark young children converse 
by turn in French, English, Italian, and their mother tongue. We are acquainted 
with families in Paris from the coloniés whose children speak five languages. 
Under the influence of necessity a Frenchman residing abroad or a person residing 
in France learns very quickly to express himself in the foreign tongue—a few weeks 
is sufficient; with the aid of a teacher, a complete mastery may be gained in six 
months, at least so far as the warts of commerce demand. ‘This result is due to the 
fact that the memory, ear, and tongue are all trained at the same time. ‘This cireum- 
stance indicates the proper method to be followed. One should turn our schools 
of commerce into a sort of French colony. Certain days should be fixed when each of 
the languages to be learned should be exclusively employed in conversation, outside 
of the lecture room. The teachers of language, much more closely attached to the 
schools than they are at present, should be present at the meals, in the study rooms, 
and in the play rooms. The noninstructing personnel of the school should be com- 
posed entirely of foreigners, each speaking two languages besides French. One 
would thus surround the pupils with persons required to converse with them in the 
languages designated, and never in French. In a word, one would create the neces- 
sity and the obligation to learn the language just as in a foreign country. 
By this rational method, which demands simultaneous training of the memory, 
ear, and tongue, progress would be much more rapid. In the three years of the com- 
mercial curriculum the young people accustomed to study would easily master three 
languages, and could learn to understand a larger number. One may object to the 
introduction of this method, thinking it would largely increase the expense of the 
schools. Butas the old saying goes, ‘“‘He who wishes the end must wish the means.” 
One must pause to consider the results, for it is the results which satisfy the public 
and secure success. We are generally divided between the desire to instruct our 
children in foreign languages and the conviction that one can do this successfully 
only by sending them abroad. But as it is painful to send one’s children away, and 
is, moreover, not always an easy thing to do, and finally as it may seem hardly rea- 
sonable to sacrifice a whole year for the sake of a single subject, it almost always 
turns out that nothing is accomplished. In this way the study of foreign languages 
among us is very limited. But would not things change altogether, to the great 
advantage of commercial schools, if this establishment should prove by positive 
results the possibility of teaching foreign languages in France itself? Then, with- 
out doubt, by this fact alone, the commercial schools would attract ‘public favor 
and their classrooms would soon become too small. 
Elocution, conferences.—The ordinary business man certainly lacks facility of speech. 
Is it not this fact which keeps them, to the great damage of the country, out of the 
public legislative halls, which are left, so to speak, almost exclusively to the politi- 
cians, while the real interests of the nation demand specially the experience of 
men trained in business practice and accustomed to the difficulties of administra- 
tion? Our commercial schools, then, should train their pupils to express themselves 
before an audience. They should accomplish this by repeated exercises in elocu- 
tionary reading; the students should accompany these readings with explanations. 
Finally, these exercises might be replaced_by short debates upon given subjects, as 
is done at the schools of Marseilles and Havre. The director of the school might 
preside at these debates. The instractorsin the office, and the teachers in geography, 
commercial law, industrial and commercial economy should also be present. 
The questions should relate to the subjects in which instruction is given. From

ten to fifteen minutes might be allowed for each speech. Each of the professors 
might correct the speech, both as to the style and the manner of the pupil falling 
within his field of instruction. The subject to be debated might be indicated at 
the close of each discussion for the following day, and the referees appointed. The 
use of notes might be allowed tothe debater, but he should not be allowed to read 
his speech. At the end of each debate, and after the pupils have gone out, marks 
might be given by the director and professors present, the same as at examinations. 
In order to give to these conferences the importance which they merit, it would be 
desirable for one of the members of the council of the school, assisted by several of 
his colleagues, to preside at least once a month. 
In the course of his career the merchant is frequently called upon to defend his 
interests. He will certainly be able to do this in a much more efficient manner if he 
has been trained in public speaking. In the chambers of administration, in the 
syndical chambers, in the consular tribunals to which he belongs he would cer- 
tainly derive great advantages from such facility. Finally, commercial schools have 
also the mission to train instructors for the commercial schools, and for this purpose 
lessons in elocution are certainly very desirable. 
Commercial law, legislation.—A knowledge, at least in outline, of the code of com- 
merce and of the various systems of law is necessary to the merchant. But we 
must not give too much space to this study for fear that the merchant, confident of 
his own knowledge, should come to believe that he could later disregard the advice 
of specialists, which would certainly be a source of danger. One should strive to 
give a practical character to this course. As a complement to the theory of com- 
mercial law, each school should possess a com'plete collection of judicial and extra- 
judicial decisions carefully annotated, and which the professor might use to explain 
to the pupils the mechanism and usages of procedure, the turns to which it Jends 
itself in skilfull hands, the contradictions of jurisprudence, the small basis there is to 
human justice, and finally the great advantage which even an unfavorable compro- 
mise ordinarily has over a suecessful lawsuit. 
In our opinion, the truly moral and practical side of this instruction would be in 
ineulcating a respect for law, for the rights of others, and to make each pupil a 
sworn cnemy to lawsuits. It is in this spirit that one should warn them against the 
many inconveniences and dangers of a suit, which takes from business precious 
time and energy, which deprives the merchant of that tranquillity of spirit whieh 
he needs so much in order to conduct his business well, and which does not often 
accomplish anything else than empty satisfaction and the enrichment of lawyers. 
Physical and natural sciences.—The elements of these sciences form a part of the gen- 
eral instruction which the pupil has received before entering the commercial sehool, 
and which will be developed in the direction of his specialties in the preparatory 
ear. 
= Mechanics.—It would be an injury to abolish this course in which the student 
learns so many useful things, among others the value of the machines for the trans- 
mission of motion, the various forms of engines—steam, gas, water, air, electro-r 
netic, ete. The elementary study of mechanics is as necessary as that ef phys 
chemistry, or natural history. 
Drawing.—The same thing is true of this as of the preceding subject. The study 
of drawing finds its application in the construction of graphical figures, diagrams, 
maps, sketches, etc. Drawing exercises the eye and the hand; it develops a taste for 
form; it unites positive instruction to matters of art, both pure and industrial, in 
whose production commerce largely deals, and which, therefore, merchants must 
know how to appreciate. 
History of commerce.—Might we not as well entitle this heading ‘‘ History of civil- 
ization?” Commerce has always played a very great role in the history of the world. 
It is that which binds together men and nations; it is that which supports progress 
in all its forms; it is the vehicle of ideas; it is the propagator of the beautiful, of 
the valuable, of the good and the useful. 
The history of commerce, connected intimately with that of humanity, gives ele- 
vated views of morals and philosophy, views which are drawn from the facts and which 
give to the future merchants a just ideaof the economic and social importance of the 
career to which they have devoted themselves. Before becoming analytic the his- 
tory of commerce should, then, be treated in a general way, as is proper, moreover, in 
other subjects in which instruction is given. One must not lose sight of the fact 
that the pupil logically feels the need ef knowing where one is leading him, and what 
purpose the subject serves in which one isinstructing him. Nothing is better adapted 
to secure his attention than to give him in advance a general idea of the leading 
features of that which one wishes him to learn. 
Politicat economy.—The more carefully this subject is developed the more valuable 
it will be. Political economy is a matter of controversy to-day at almost all points, 
and the schools ought to beware of teaching their pupils disputable doctrines, whether 
economic or socialistic. The professor should limit himself to setting forth the 
       
       g- Ss es,     
   
-P-A-G-E-903
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 827 
general facts of production, circulation, and consumption of wealth; the aifferent sys- 
tems of exchanges, and the advantages and disadvantages which appear according 
to the zones of industry and commerce. This must suffice. Commercial instruction 
can not have as its purpose the training of dialecticians, but rather of practical men, 
who will derive more advantage from the study of domestic, industrial, and commer- 
cial economy than from the generalities of political economy, which will remain 
matters of controversy. : 
We have explained elsewhere that these differences upon the point of doctrine 
spring largely from the lack of sufficiently exact and complete statistics, a defect 
which one must attribute to the general insufficiency of practical accounting. From 
this it results that even the facts of production, circulation, and consumption of 
wealth have thus far escaped a complete analysis, which might set them forth in a 
clear light. Political and social economy is, therefore, a science still full of obseuri- 
ties and contradictions, and, consequently, a science the instruction in which should 
be carefully conducted in the schools. 
Morals.—Morals is a complex of the ideas and rules intended to direct our actions. 
Merals is independent of religion, and is anterior to it. Every man has an idea of 
justice and injustice, of that which is good and of that which is bad, of that which he 
ought to do and of that which he ought not todo. Even thesavages have their rules 
of family and social morals. The courses in the history of commerce, in the various 
commercial and industrial branches, in political economy, and the courses in law 
and legislation imply morals. Higher commercial instruction should include socio- 
logical studies from which morals might be scientifically separated, and not merely 
by the exposition of its principles, which one knows without reasoning about them. 
Ethics, then, holds a large place in commercial education. It is a question of prin- 
ciple; it is also a vital question; a question of existence that our commerce should 
be and should remain true. 
German commerce, in the efforts which it is making to compete with ours, is becom- 
ing more demoralized from year to year. French commerce, on the contrary, ought 
to strive to secure a reputation for. excellence of its products and for honesty in its 
transactions, where manufacturers would be convinced of the truth that honesty is 
areal forco, just asorder and as the love of labor, and that without honesty the rela- 
tions between merchants and consumers can not be permanent. 
Our retail commerce, particularly that in cloth and food, is paying dearly at the 
present moment for losing sight of this truth. In fact, our shopkeepers seem to be 
possessed of the strange idea that they have the right to cheat because they have 
paid foralicense. Tell them that commerce is organized robbery, and they will pro- 
test only for form’s sake, if they protest at all. ‘They do not revolt under a sense of 
injury. Their conscience cries out to them: ‘You rob whenever you make a sale, 
every day, every hour; you rob in quantity, quality, and price; you teach your wife, 
your children, your clerks torob as youdo. Yourob the poor as wellas the rich; you 
would rob your own mother, and if it is necessary, in order to increase your profits, 
that you should adulterate and poison, you become an adulterator and a poisoner. 
All this, too, without courage, for you rob and poison withoutrunning anyrisk. Your 
victims greet you, thank you, and aroinclined to think that you are good, honest men 
because you do not rob them more. But when tired of you your patrons flee from you 
on the very first occasion, Then go; run after them into the galleries of the great 
establishments whose competition is ruining you without mercy; into the markets, 
into the bazars better equipped than your shops, and where‘one can buy at better 
rates. Go, beseech your patrons; try to excite their pity for the lot of the small 
shopkeeper on account of the competition to which he is exposed—you will then see 
how they ridicule you.” 
After twenty years more at this rate our small shopkeepers will have disappeared 
in Paris and in the large cities. See to what end piracy leads! 
Let us avoid a similar fate for our wholesale trade. Let us preserve a precious 
reputation for thorough honesty, which will sooner or later bring back to us the con- 
sumers who for a time are led away by the artifices of our rivals. 8 
The properly constructed programme of commercial instruction, then, condemns 
such piracy and constantly pleads for order, good faith, and honor. It is for this 
reason that accounting, ascience of order in accounts, should be kept at the very head 
of this programme—accounting—the history of the facts of human labor in numbers; 
accounting, hated by the pirates who practice in the dark and do not love to face 
their robberies; accounting, whose accurate practice will save our industry by spur- 
ring on its progress, still hesitating and uncertain for lack of this orderly principle. 
Let us go into a great factory, where we see exposed small objects cut in bone and. 
ivory. And as we go into eestacies over the cheapness and the fine workmanship of 
these objects, the merchant remarks to us: ‘‘ Here are some made in Switzerland and 
Germany; I am going to astonish you. Not only are they more poorly made than 
ours, but they cost more. This is casy to explain; our Parisian laborers are more 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-904
  828 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
skillful, do double the work in the same time, and you see that the workmanship is 
much more elegant.” Is not this atypical example? The manufacturer adds: ‘You 
haye just organized a system of accounting which has enabled me to reform my system 
of manufacture. In consequence, I have diminished my capital, reduced my business 
expenses, cut down the useless general charges, increased the general productive 
charges, perfected my equipment, interested my personnel and my laborers in the 
welfare of my enterprise, etc., so that to-day I find it to my advantage to manufac- 
ture in Paris, and the foreigners purchase of me. People pretend that French man- 
ufacturers can not stand competition, and give as a reason that labor is dearer here 
than elsewhere. Ill will, routine, and ignorance have much more to do with our 
inability. The truth is, that labor equalizes itself in all industrial centers. It is to 
be had cheaply only where it is not in demand. 
“The truth is, also, that we have accustomed ourselves to buy at high prices what- 
ever gives a large profit, without being obliged to reckon closely. The truth is, also, 
that whenever we wish we can sell at as low a price and as good a quality a8 our 
competitors. It occasioned great expense, I admit, to change 1 my method of doing 
business, but to-day I count myself happy for having taken in time a step which 
saved me from ruin and transformed my industry. If other manufacturers would do 
likewise we should have nothing to fear from our neighbors.” 
“You speak to me of commercial morality,” adds our interlocutor; ‘it is indeed a 
subject of great importance, and upon which you rightly insist. Commercial moral- 
ity is not an illusion or a myth as paradoxical as prejudiced people may pretend. 
There is no social department in which practice mist conform to thorough honesty 
more than in ours. Even the soldier does not introduce greater regularity into his 
life than the merchant who is worthy of the name must into his. No one has more 
care than he to fulfill engagements once entered into and his word once given. I 
repeat it, we must and can carry on business in an honest way. This is to be our 
force; this will be our glory! Our city is skillful in labor, it has taste, it has invent- 
iveness—this is essential. When our education in matters relating to commerce and 
industry shall be well organized, and when we shall conform our lives to this instruc- 
tion, we shall be invincible.’ 
Music, bodily exercise.—Music is the education of the senses, and this reason alone 
would determine us to include it in professional instruction. Experience in affairs 
and relations of life shows, moreover, that the possession of an agreeable art is often 
a valuable means of success, by making the circumstances favorable to the individ- 
nal, to say nothing of the fact that it is a good preservative from the dangers of ennui 
and idleness. Finally, in a school where the courses of study demand a continued 
tension of the mind toward science and the positivesubjects of commercial economy, 
nothing will relieve the pupil better than music, which, like drawing, like litera- 
ture, like the bodily exercises in the gymnasium and fencing hall, enters into the 
hygiene of a well-balanced education. A good system of instruction must respond to 
the various wants and aspirations of man. It must conform to the law of contrasts. 
Without this it would produce a destruction of the just balance in the moral and 
physical health of the pupil, resulting in lassitude and disgust. 
Lessons in vocal and instrumental music might be given in the evening after the 
study hour, from 9 to 10 o’clock. They could alternate with conversation hours. 
They should be obligatory like the other branches, and gratuitous like the lessons in 
gymnastics and boxing. Riding lessons, however, might be optional and extra. 
Commercial and industrial visits, These visits should be made every Thursday, not 
only to the shops and magazines of commerce and industry, but also to the various 
museums and public expositions. Such lessons being a part of the professional 
instruction, should be provided for in the formal regulations; and all schools, without 
exception, should be required to observe them. As it isnot possible to give in a prof- 
itable manner lessons of this sort to a large number of pupils at once, the various 
classes would have to. be worked in sections, going in different directions under the 
conduct of the special instructors. At the Commercial Institute, where this system 
has already been begun this year, most of the pupils are sent off each Thursday to 
several different places. The goneral application of this system would present, the 
advantage of varying the lessons in technical things according to the previous prep- 
aration of the pupils, and by proceeding methodically by going from the simple to 
the complex. 
General considerations.—It is said that “silence is golden,” If this proverb is true, 
it does not apply to ideas which ought to be spoken. Our commercial schools have 
all rendered services which are not generally appreciated at their true value, because 
of the silence which one has observed in regard to it up to the present time, and 
which we believe it is our duty to bréak, if for no other purpose than to serve by our 
modest efforts a cause which seems to us intimately connected with the future pros- 
perity of our country. Making all due concessions, the equipment of the French 
schools of commerce is not inferior in any respect to that of the other schools of 
     
  
 
-P-A-G-E-905
    COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 829 
general or special instruction. If one considers the efforts thus far put forth by them, 
the difficulties of every sort which they have surmounted, and the results which they 
have obtained in spite of these difficulties, one must be convinced that the evil days 
of commercial instruction are approaching their end, and that public favor will soon 
replace the indifference, as inconceivable as it is unjust. 
Does not superior commercial instruction answer to the wants of all social positions, 
except possibly the so-called ‘literary profession,” and indeed may we not say of 
them—for the lawyer, the magistrate, the public functionary, the councilor find it 
to their advantage to know the theory and practice of business? The employees in 
our commerce and industry, merchants, manufacturers, bankers, brokers, exchangers, 
farmers—that is to say, all the active personnel of our interior and foreign commerce— 
ought they not to have this instruction in preference to any other? As to the fami- 
lies of fortune, who do not destine their children to commercial or industrial business, 
what better education could they give them than that which comprises in its curric- 
ulum the science of order and economy—knowledge necessary to the preservation 
of a fortune. Practical arithmetic, accounting, living languages, the elements of 
civil and commercial law, and the many other subjects—are not these branches more 
necessary to the modern mind than Latin, Greek, ancient history, etc.? What, then, 
is lacking in this economic education to make it in demand? 
It lacks only the sanction which crowns university studies. It is not sufficient to 
open the doors of entrance into the schools of commerce, one must also open the doors 
ot exit. Nothing further can be done until the legitimate demands in favor of eco- 
nomic instruction shall be met and it shall be puton a par with classical instruction. 
  HIGHER COMMERCIAL INSTRUCTION IN GERMANY. 
Germany has, in many respects, the most fully developed system of commercial 
schools of lower and higher grade in Europe. As the subject of this work relates 
primarily to commercial high schools, it will not be necessary to do more than men- 
tion the large number of primary and secondary schools of commercial instruction 
to be found within the limits of the German Empire. The work by Harry Schmitt! 
gives a very full account of the present extent of commercial education in Germany. 
A statistical table, referring to the same subject and published in Glasser’s work,? 
brings the data down to the school year 1892-93. 
It appears from these works that there are some fifty-five schools in the German 
Empire which may be classed under the head of commercial high schools, with a 
total of 5,681 pupils. Many of these are supported by merchant guilds, a number 
by the cities and a few by the State. The commercial classes and commercial courses 
organized in connection with the real schools are, of course, supported by the State 
or city, respectively. 
In Germany, at a very early date, the better class of commercial high schools 
obtained for their graduates the privileges of the one-year military exemption law. 
This had a very beneficial influence upon the attendance at these schools, and the 
fact that no discrimination in this respect is made against commercial high schools, 
has undoubtedly contributed very largely to the success of these institutions. 
THE PUBLIC COMMERCIAL INSTITUTE AT LEIPSIC, 
[Oeffentliche Handels-Lehranstalt zu Leipzig.] 
Of all these schools, the Public Commercial Institute at Leipsic is, perhaps, for 
our purpose, the best type, and as it is the oldest of the existing schools, it presents, 
to a certain extent, a picture of the development of this branch of instruction in the 
German Empire. 
This celebrated institute owes its origin to the Merchant Guild of Leipsic, a cor- 
poration which has existed since the year 1479, and whose numerous special privileges 
were ended with the introduction of commercial liberty into the Kingdom of Saxony 
in 1861. In 1867 this corporation became an open society. Shortly before this time 
a ministerial ordinance had established the chambers of commerce for the purpose 
of representing commercial interests.? 
Five of these chambers of commerce have been established in Saxony. There was 
nothing more, therefore, for this ancient Merchant Guild of Leipsic to do except to 
watch over the interests of the schools of commerce, to help, with the considerable 
fortune which it possessed, certain needy merchants, and to assist other various

public enterprises. It devoted itself to this useful mission, but as no new members 
could be chosen the extinction of this guild was only a matter of time, and in conse- 
quence of an agreement between this guild and the Chamber of Commerce at Leipsie 
the school became the property of the latter body and is supported by the same, 
using, in the first instance, the income of the funds which belonged to the former 
Merchant Guild. 
The honor of persuading the Merchant Guild to found in 1831 a practical and theo- 
retical school of commerce belonged to Charles Lebrecht Hammer, a member of the 
firm of Hammer & Schmidt. The Commercial Institute of Leipsic was not, it is 
true, the first school of this sort established in Germany. A man named Busch had 
established, at his own expense, an Academy of Commerce in Hamburg toward the 
close of tho last century, and this academy had prospered for some time. The Mer- 
chant Guild of Gotha had a school for apprentices in commercial houses from the 
year 1818, and finally in several of the larger cities of Germany there were private 
schools of this sort. 
The Merchant Guild of Leipsic, then, can not claim the credit of having been the 
first to establish such a school, but it was the first in Germany, we believe, to open 
a professional school, in which they proposed to train future merchants who desired 
to prepare themselves for business by appropriate theoretical studies. 
While the common run of merchants declared at that time, as generally in Frauce, 
against this sort of preparation in a school, the Merchant Guild of Leipsic recog- 
nized at that time and emphasized the necessity of raising the level of special 
studies for those youth who were destined for commercial pursuits, and the further 
necessity of preparing the way for practice by a study of the theory. Such had also 
been the object, as we have seen in another place, of the men who established the 
Superior School of Commerce in Paris in 1820. } 
The foundation of the Institute of Leipsic was assisted by the Saxon Government. 
King Anthony showed himself favorable to tho enterprise and contributed from his 
private purse. In 1835 the Chamber of Commerce granted a subsidy of 1,500 German 
dollars; this subsidy is continued at present. 
One fortunate umstance contributed to the rapid growth of the Commercial 
Institute of Leipsic. Its first director, David August Schiebe, was a man of great 
knowledge, of large experience, and at the same time of a very energetic character. 
He gave to the establishment an excellent organization. The severe discipline which 
he introduced and the success which followed it gave the school a great prestige. 
David August Schiebe was born at Strasburg, in Alsace, on the 2d of October, 
1779. He pursued his studies in the lyceum of this city, and was then entered as an 
apprentice in a commercial house of his native place. He was later a clerk at Stras- 
burg, and from 1804 to 1807 was employed in a banking house at Frankfort. In 1807 
he returned to Strasburg and entered the house of Franck & Co. In his leisure hours 
he occupied himself with literary work, and gave lessons to young merchants. In 
1817 he gathered a certain number of instructors about him, and his enterprise 
seemed upon the point of becoming a school of commerce. But the attempt was 
premature, and he was obliged to close the institution after two years. He then 
devoted himself to the direction of industrial enterprises, and acted as agent in most 
varied commercial affairs. In 1819 he published, in French, his theoretical and 
practical treatise on Bills of Exchange, a work which was followed in 1825 by his 
Commercial Correspondence, 
Some years after this tho school at Leipsic was opened. The directorship of the 
school was offered to him, and Schiebe hastened to accept a position which enabled 
him to spread his ideas and to establish a system of instruction, the necessity of 
which he had been one of the first to recognize, 
The necessary text-books for this instruction were not at hand; Schiebe prepared 
them. His works on Commercial Arithmetic, Bookkeeping, and The Science of the 
Counting-House exercised a wide influence upon the development of commercial 
studies in Germany. They appeared in a large number of editions during his life 
and after his death. ‘‘Even to-day,” says Kippenberg, formerly director of the 
school at Gera, ‘“‘Schiebe’s books are the best to be found in this branch of instruction.” 
After having directed with great success, and in what may be called a truly prac- 
tical manner, the school of Leipsie down to the year 1850, Schiebe retired from the 
management and returned to Strasburg, his native city, where he died the following 
ye: His talents, his experience, and his professional loyalty render his memory 
dear to all his former pupils. For his indefatigable devotion and for the didactic 
works which he left behind him the school at Leipsic and in general the professors 
of commercial instruction in Germany owe him undying gratitude. 
The successor of Schiebe from 1850 to 1862 was Alexander Steinhouse. After hav- 
ing been employed for twenty-seven years in the greatest commercial houses at 
Breslau, Venice, and Tampico he traveled in France, Germany, America, and the 
Indies, and closed his career as a merchant at Riga. From that time on he devoted 
his activity to the study of the commercial sciences, and for ten years was professor     
   
  
     
-P-A-G-E-907
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 831 
in various public and private schools, and at last at Moscow. He devoted himself 
to the writing of pedagogical works, and published a commercial arithmetic in 
Russia. Under his direction the Commercial Institute of Leipsic improved its 
methods of instruction, and the number of its pupils went on increasing. In 1862 
Steinhouse resigned his position as director and went to establish a school of com- 
merce at Breslau. 
From 1863 to 1878 the director of the Commercial Institute of Leipsic was Dr. Karl 
Gustav Oderman. He had been professor in this school from 1839 to 1854, and was, 
consequently, fully acquainted with everything relating to it. He had, moreover, 
shown his ability for directing work by his assistance in the founding and directing 
of a commercial school at Dresden. Under his direction the school of Leipsic pre- 
served in general its former character, but it experienced numerous innovations in 
the scope of its instruction—innovations rendered necessary by the new school law 
of the Kingdom of Saxony and by the educational reforms in Germany. We shall 
describe these changes more fully below. 
Dr. Oderman also took up the revision of the pedagogical works by Schiebe, which 
remained, so to speak, the classical works in this school. In cooperation with Dr. 
Feller, Oderman wrote a commercial arithmetic, which has been a great success in 
the commercial world, and which is now in its fifteenth edition. Oderman resigned 
in 1878, and left the school with the reputation of an experienced master, of a scien- 
tific trainer of youth, and an energetic director. In recognition of these services 
the King of Saxony, from whom he had already obtained several distinctions, 
accorded him the title of professor. 
Charles Wolfrum, who succeeded him in 1878 as director of the school, had been 
professor of the commercial sciences at the Commercial School of Augsburg from 
1851 to 1862; director of the school at Gotha from 1862 to 1872, and director of the 
School of Commerce at Augsburg from 1872 to 1878. He still holds the position of 
director at the Commercial Institute at Leipsic. 
We shall have oceasion later to speak more in detail of the organization of the 
institute, but to give a general notion of its development it will be sufficient to noto 
here that from 1851 to 1886 there were 5,827 pupils in the department for apprentices; 
5,002 pupils in the higher department; 322 pupils in the professional course; making 
a total of 11,151 pupils in fifty-five years, or an average of about 202 pupils a year. 
The Commercial Institute of Leipsic had in 1884-85, 472 pupils; 1885-86, 494 pupils; 
1890-91, 620 pupils; 1891-92, 662 pupils; 1892-93, 681 pupils.   
DIVISION OF THE INSTITUTE—GOVERNMENT—TEES. 
The Commercial Institute of Leipsic, as noted above, has been, since December 21, 
1886, under the control of the Leipsic Chamber of Commerce. It is under immedi- 
ate supervision of the city council of Leipsic, and under the general supervision of 
tho royal ministry of the interior. The school board, which has immediate charge 
of the school, is elected by the Chamber of Commerce, and consists of six members, 
elected for a term of six years, one-half going out at the end of each three years. 
The purpose of the school, according to the statutes published in 1888, is a two- 
fold one. One is to give the commercial apprentices an opportunity to obtain the 
necessary general education and special training necessary for their calling; sec- 
ondly, to give the desirable scientilic training to those youth who wish to devote 
themselves to commerce and similar careers. The school is, accordingly, divided into 
three divisions. First, the apprentice department, which is the continuation school 
for apprentices actually engaged in commercial houses, and whose pupils arerelieved 
from the necessity of visiting the city continuation schools. Secondly, the higher 
department, which is authorized to grant a certificate, conferring the privileges of 
the one-year military service law upon those pupils who complete the course in this 
division. Thirdly, the professional course, the purpose of which is to acquaint young 
men who have already acquired by study along other lines the degree of education 
necessary to secure the privileges of the one-year exemption law with the general 
theory of commerce, 
PROVISIONS RELATING TO TIE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS OF THE SCHOOL. 
First, apprentice department.—Every apprentice of a Leipsic commercial house can 
be admitted in the apprentice department upon showing his fitness to take up the 
work. Each candidate must pass an entrance examination. In order to he admitted 
into the third or lowest class, it is necessary that the pupil shall have completed an 
elementary school. To be admitted to the second class, he must show that he is 
acquainted with the subjects taughtin the third class. Pupils can be admitted oniy 
upon the request of the head of a commercial house, who thereby becomes responsible

Third, professional course.—As this is the most advanced class in the school, only those 
pupils are admitted who hold a certificate entitling them to the privileges of the one- 
year military service law, or who have completed an equivalent course. This depart-

week, and a regular students’ department, with thirty-four hours aweek. The course 
in both cases covers one year.

Insiruction is given between the hours of 7 and 9 in the morning. 
Tt will be noted that this institution is organized so as to answer the wants of a 
commercial community in a most complete way. For those young men who have 
had a good preliminary preparation, such as is involved in the completion of what 
_ We may call an ordinary English high school, and who have gone directly from that 
into business, there is found an opportunity in the apprentice division of the pro- 
fessional course to get assistance in the special or technical study of the business in 
which they are engaged. Those who are able to spend another year, after completing 
such a course as is mentioned, find in the regular students’ division of the profes- 
sional course an opportunity to spend another year in preparing themselves some- 
what more specially before entering upon a business career. This latter course 
corresponds very closely to the graduate course described in connection with the 
Prague and Vienna academies of commerce. 
The second or higher division of this school corresponds very closely to what we 
should call an ordinary commercial high school, with a course of three years. It is 
evident that the pupil attending this department must give his entire time to the 
work of the school. 
In the first, or apprentice department, an opportunity is offered for those clerks 
and apprentices in business houses who have had the advantage of an elementary 
school education, to carry on systematic work, suited to their age and preliminary 
training, at the same time that they are engaged in commercial houses. It will be 
noted, as stated above, that the instruction in the apprentice department, both 
higher and lower, is given between the hours of 7 and 9 in the morning, so that 
pupils are able to attend these courses while actually engaged in business. It will 
be interesting to note the distribution of students among the various departments. 
In 1892-93 out of 681 pupils 454 were in the first, or apprentice division, taking 
the ten hours a week course through the three years; 155 were in the higher division; 
and 72 were in the professional course, of whom 37 were in the regular division and 
35 in the apprentice division. 
The second, or higher division, corresponds to the regular course in the academies 
of Prague and Vienna. It will be noted that the first, or elementary division, has 
by far the largest number of pupils, and to judge from the growing number in this 
department it answers a real want in a commercial community like that of Leipsic. 
In the annual report of the Commercial Institute for 1892-93 the director expresses 
himself as follows upon one or two important matters connected with the curriculum 
of the school: 
“Wholesale and retail trade are as different in their methods of work as the ordi- 
nary work of a mechanic and that in a large factory. In training youth, therefore, 
ED 96. 27   
   
-P-A-G-E-910
  834 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
for one or the other of these callings, the demands to be made are very different. To 
do good work in retail trade one needs less comprehensiveness of knowledge than 
skill and reliability in the operations of simple business transactions, The curricu- 
lum of an ordinary public school gives the apprentice in retail trade, therefore, a 
satisfactory preliminary training. If to this be added certain instruction in a prop- 
erly organized professional school the young pupil receives a scientific basis upon 
which the more ambitious of them can successfully build. And it will remain for 
experience to bring their technical skill to its highest degree. 
“But this course of study is very insufficient for a young man who wishes to 
occupy & more important position in the field of wholesale trade. Itis a great fault 
in our commercial education that we are trying to reach by a simple supplementary 
course, such as that given in our first division, the same result as can be obtained 
only upon the basis of thorough preliminary training. This is sometimes done from 
ignorance and sometimes from lack of resources, The large dealer has no less 
important functions to perform in a community than the educated individuals of 
other classes, and he can fulfill them satisfactorily only if he is willing to give as 
much time and care to his education as the members of other classes are willing to 
give to theirs. We must allow to each youth an opportunity to obtain a well-rounded 
general education first of all, and then, before entering commercial life, a careful 
course in the commercial sciences and languages. Instruction of such importance 
can not be carried on as a mere side issue, before or after business hours. It can only 
accomplish its proper result in case the pupils have a satisfactory preliminary train- 
ing, are of the proper age, and devote their entire time to the school. Such supple- 
mentary or continuation instruction as is given in our first department is and can 
be only a temporary resource. The object of this department must remain, there- 
fore, so long as present conditions prevail, the education of the mercantile middle 
class for the work of retail trade. Nothing more can be accomplished by this method 
of instruction. 
“The curriculum covers three years of ten hours a week; the subjects are indi- 
cated above. Very little is demanded of the pupils in the way of work at home. 
It is fortunate that the instruction can be given between the hours of 7 and 9 in the 
morning, or 2 and 4 in the afternoon, while body and mind are still fresh. Evening 
work along this line is almost useless. 
“The attendance in this first division has increased from year to year, a proof that 
its advantages are coming to be generally recognized by our mercantile classes. In 
consequence of this growing attendance it has been possible to divide the pupils 
into divisions according to their preliminary training. Those who are better pre- 
pared are put into the same divisions, and the instruction can be carried somewhat 
further and with better success than in the other divisions. As a rule about 70 to 75 
per cent of the pupils who enter have completed the curriculum of the public school 
(what wein the United States should call the grammar school), the others have 
attended the lower classes of higher schools. Itis interesting to note that about 
one-fourth of the pupils who enter this department complete the three-year course. 
At the close of the second year most of these pupils have reached an age when they 
are no longer required to attend a continuation school, and it is seldom that their 
own desire, or the wish of parents or masters, is strong enough to persuade them to 
complete the course.” ! 
In regard to the professional course the director makes the following remarks in 
the same report: 
“Tt has become more and more evident every year that the business circles of our 
own and other cities are coming to recognize the importance of our professional 
course (third department of the institute). Well-known manufacturers and mer- 
chants both at home and abroad are sending their sons to this course, in consequence 
of the favorable opinions of former graduates. We have received, and are receiving, 
from day to day, very flattering letters from former graduates and from employers. 
Indeed, it would be a cause for surprise if a year’s earnest study of foreign languagesand 
the various branches. of commercial science should not have a permanent influence 
upon the intellectual development of the pupils. The extraordinary ability of the 
young German merchant, who is coming to be recognized in foreign countries, 
though in many cases with great unwillingness and with considerable envy, is no 
result of routine work. It is the consequence of careful and thorough training of 
our young people. Our mercantilo classes should, therefore, derive new courage 
from this fact; they should rather make many steps forward than a single one back- 
ward. They should be careful not to save time and money at the wrong place. A 
nation whose commercial ralations are extending throughout all continents, whose

mercantile and naval marine is well equipped for the very best service, whose banner 
waves over many colonies, needs merchants of insight, financiers of wisdom, and 
inventive and enterprising organizers.” 
PROGRAMME AND METHODS. 
Léantey, in his excellent work, so frequently referred to in this report, also calls 
attention to the fact that the Institute of Leipsic has taken special pains to divide 
and subdivide its instruction so as to adapt it in the best manner possible to the 
wants of its pupils. The business of the retail dealer does not necessiate such 
special and comprehensive knowledge as that of the wholesale dealer. The small 
merchant can only rarely turn to a profitable purpose in his sphere of action the 
knowledge of foreign languages, of mathematics, of algebra, ete. He needs, how- 
ever, to be well acquainted with the goods themselves, to be versed in mercantile 
calculation, accounting, ete. The Institute of Leipsic has then established an ele- 
mentary training, and a more advanced training for young men who wish to cnter 
the wholesale trade. 
In Germany the youth of limited means generally enter business immediately upon 
quitting the elementary school. Those who take up commerce as a career complete 
their school training in a continuation school during the three or four years of 
apprenticeship, through which they must pass. They are required by law to follow 
the courses of these schools while serving their apprenticeship. Under these condi- 
tions, it is no great disadvantage for them to enter at an early age upon business life, 
which trains them in the handling of goods, in the proper conduct toward their 
customers, in bookkeeping, and in applying the knowledge which they gain in the 
school. 
There are also the studies preparatory for more advanced positions, studies in 
which the Institute of Leipsic gives by far the largest share to theory, contrary to 
the method applied in the beginning by Schiebe. This development, a work of 
time, of circumstances, and of the difficulties which lay in the way of developing a 
suitable personnel to give the instruction, is worthy of careful study. Schiebe laid 
down a programme of study which shows his preference for practical work; instruc- 
tion in the science of commerce beginning in the second class, four hours a week. 
Schiebe himself gave this course, following the theory of commercial science by 
Jacob and his own works upon the subject; he thought that the pupil would 
arrive at a better understanding of commercial affairs if he actually went through 
the same process as the merchant in his office. 
“This method is empiric,” said Dr. nerick, ‘‘it offers, it is true, a certainadvan- 
tage, it trains the pupils in acquiring a certain facility and external polish, but the 
real knowledge and training which is the essential part can. not be acquired by such 
an unscientific method.” 
Certainly, we answer, practical lessons ought not to precede theoretical lessons. 
But after the theory has been set forth, these practical lessons may come in to com- 
plete the training of the pupil and to enable him to derive the fullest advantage 
from the instruction in the school. It is, however, very essential that these practical 
lessons shall be well given. It is this upon which we have insisted in our plan upon 
the reorganization of commercial instruction. (Léautey.) 
“At the school at Leipsic,” continues our correspondent, ‘‘many years passed 
before we had text-books treating of the various branches of commercial science 
in amanner simple and clear. It was only as the result of long development that 
we came to see that the simple repetition of the same exercises again and again has 
only a very small value, if one does not penetrate into the very reason and spirit of 
the same. Everywhere we endeavored to discover a common law resulting from the 
unending variety of similar facts, and by this means to escape a useless prolixity. 
This is the road which scientific commercial instruction in Germany has followed to 
perfect itself.” 
Very well. But in this way has: there not been a certain abuse of theory? 
Extremes meet, and they are ordinarily equally pernicious. We repeat what we 
said before, that the schools of commerce should be at once polytechnic schools and 
schools of application, and in order that application shall bear its best fruit it is 
necessary that it should be exercised not upon imaginary operations, but upon real 
operations properly conducted, properly systematized, and all the documents relat- 
ing to which should be methodically brought together under the eyes of the pupils. 
It would be superfluous to recount here the various modifications which were made 
in the Institute of Leipsic from 1831 to 1868, modifications which were suggested by 
the experience of the school. It 1s sufficient to say that during this whole period 
the basis of the method remained the same as Schiebe had instituted in the first 
instance. But in the movement for educational reform from 1868 to 1871 the Insti- 
tute at Leipsic was compelled to follow the movement or lose its title of a higher 
school. The law relating to military service in Saxony, of December 24, 1866, had

conceded to the three schools of commerce at Dresden, Chemnitz, and Leipsic the 
right to give a certificate entitling to the one-year military service privileges, and 
A necessary to reorganize the instruction to conform to the requirements of 
this law. 
It was, then, at this time that the university tendency of general culture began 
to overbalance the purely commercial instruction of early years both at the Institute 
at Leipsic, and, in general, in all the higher schools of commerce in Germany. In 
all these institutions it was necessary, in order to comply with the provisions of the 
military law, to reorganize their curricula from the very bottom, and to give more time 
to the instruction in mathematics, physical and natural sciences, history, geography, 
and literature, This reorganization implied the necessity of diminishing the time 
iven to the commercial sciences, and also the importance of the practical exercises 
in the countinghouse. 
it was not until 1869 that the Institute at Leipsic declared itself ready to comply 
with the legal provisions, and from that time on this establishment acquired the 
right to give the certificate for the one-year voluntary service. 
This change in its instruction led it, on the other hand, to enlarge the sphere of 
action of the school, in order to preserve its former professional character. It was 
noted that a certain number of pupils from the real schools, who held the military 
certificate, entered immediately into business life, to spend the years which had still to 
elapse before they were of military age. These young men, from 16 to 17 years of 
age, while trained in modern languages, mathematics, history, geography, but entirely 
unacquainted with the commercial sciences, found themselves at a disadvantage in 
their practical careers on account of this lack of special knowledge. It appeared, 
then, to be plain that the Institute at Leipsic had here the task of creating a profes- 
sional course for those young men who had obtained the military The 
success of this course, opened in 1876, did not entirely meet the expectations of its 
founders. 
Three years later, in 1879, another attempt was made. By the side of the profes- 
sional course, which comprises ten lectures a week, another course was established 
of from thirty to thirty-two exercises per week for those youth who held the military 
certificate and were willing to devote an additional year to study for preparation of 
the commercial career, This last course was received with considerable favor, and 
the attendance shows a steady increase. This result, although very satisfactory, 
shows that in Germany, as in France, public opinion is still in doubt as to the value 
of commercial instruction. 
The director of the school expressed himself upon this point in the following 
manner; 
“Té is thought,” he said, ‘by large classes of our population that commercial 
practice can fully take the place of theoretical knowledge. It is, however, true that 
he who has a theoretical knowledge learns more from experience than the mere 
empiricist, to whom he will always be superior when it comes to a matter of judg- 
ment or to execute intelligently an order, or to act with energy and decision in dif- 
ferent situations; but many years will probably pass before the value of our techni- 
cal professional instruction will be fully appreciated and before the number of our 
pupils increases in proportion to the advantages which professional study assures to 
him who follows it thoroughly.” 
It is not necessary to print a synopsis of the courses, as the individual subjects 
taught cover very much the same ground, having due regard to the greater or less 
proportion of time devoted to them, as in the French and Austrian schools. It will 
be noted from a comparison of the curriculum given above with those of the schools 
in France and Austria that considerably more attention is given to the nontechnical 
subjects in Germany. ‘This may be explained, however, by the fact mentioned above, 
that in order to get the privilege of granting the military certificate, these schools 
were obliged to introduce general subjects more largely, rather than because of any 
belief that the German curriculum in its present form is better than the French or 
Austrian. 
It is not necessary to go into a more detailed discussion of questions of discipline, 
eic., as in this respect the Institute of Leipsic differs but little from those already 
mentioned. A glance at the budget of the school may, however, be of interest. 
‘The school is carried on, under ordinary conditions, in such a way that a financial 
deficit regularly occurs, which is met by the chamber of commerce from the pro- 
ceeds of funds belonging toit. It is well housed in a model school building, erected 
in 1890. The budget for the year 1885-86 shows the following receipts and expendi- 
tures.

NorE.—Sections of the report relating to higher commercial instruction in Bel- 
gium, Italy, and England areomitted. In regard to the latter Professor James says: 
“Tt is not far from the truth to say that. there is no such instruction given in 
England at all, at least such thorough, systematic, and advanced instruction as 
. would justify our putting it in the same category as that of nee, Austria, or Ger- 
many. It isin this department as in so many others. The genius of the people—so 
eminently commercial—the favorable situation of the country, and the many other 
circumstances which have combined to put England at the very head of commercial 
nations, have also seemed at first to dispense with the necessity of giving time and 
labor to systematic school preparation for such occupations. On the other hand, the 
many unfavorable circumstances which have combined to prevent the growth of 
commerce and industry in Germany, l'rance, and Austria have brought these nations 
to a recognition of the fact that thorough education along all these lines the only 
hope of their being able to compete with England at all. The result has been what 
might have been expected. Owing to the superior education and training of her 
youth Germany has been steadily diminishing the disadvantages of her ition, 
and English merchants are now awaking to the fact not only that German trade is 
increasing more rapidly than English but that even the trade of England herself is 
passing into the hands of German merchants who have settled in London.”

    CHAPTER XVI. 
EARLY EDUCATIONAL LIFE IN MIDDLE GEORGIA. 
VACATION TIME—ACADEMIES—A MANUAL-LABOR SCHOOL—THE 
UNIVERSITY. 
I.—VAcATION TIME. 
Some account has been given of society in middle Georgia during the period of 
occupation by immigrants from the older States, mainly from Virginia and North 
Carolina, who,. despite the perils on the very border of savage existence, were 
attracted thither by the extraordinary fecundity and salubrity of that region. 
Therein it appeared that, on account of peculiar exigencies of situation in the 
beginning, patrician rule, as in all similar conditions in the past, obtained; but 
that, not long afterwards, other exigencies equally important led to coalescence of 
the several classes of whites for purposes of security and well-being needful to all. 
To this coalescence, it was argued, were owing the speedy, healthful growth and 
development of a rural population which in a comparatively brief while helped to 
raise the State, the youngest of the thirteen, to a high rank among its confederates. 
In that account were mentioned some of the shifts to which resort was compelled 
under the then existing conditions to obtain for the children of those immigrants 
instruction in the elements of learning, and sketches were made of what came to be 
known as ‘‘Old-field schools,” which were, perhaps, if not the most unique, at least 
the most crude among the elementary schools throughout the whole country, yet, 
notwithstanding their eccentricities and jejuneness, productive of much benefit to 
* the new community so far distant from enlightened centers. Exuberance of health 
and eagerness of enterprise enabled tho settlers to meet difficulties and drawbacks, 
make the best of opportunities, however slender, turn all accidents to every possible 
good account, and, fully conscious of the need of better things, patiently, yet with 
energy and confidence, labor for their procurement. Boys and girls who got their 
first instruction at these schools, even those grown afterwards to be among the 
most eminent and accomplished, used to recall and rehearse scenes therein enacted 
so grotesque and bizarre as to sound incredible, yet which, even including some 
that were barbarous, were told not only without a tittle of pain or resentment, but 
with a humor so gushing as to be thankful for things whose recollections inspired it, 
Note was made in that account of the intermingling of sexes both in school and 
in class, and some habitudes peculiar to such close relationship, including inchoate 
devotion of the stronger to the weaker. Mention was made, also, of several things 
in discipline, of the games and sports indulged separately by boys and girls, and 
of other things attendant upon school life. 
In this chapter the writer will undertake to describe portions of the life of boys 
and girls while out of school, within family circles, and, when grown old enough for 
them, in social reunions. Field sports of boys will be mentioned, and such games as, 
during the approach toward maturity, both sexes played in company. The chapter 
will end with an account of the very early ages at which marriage engagements in

general were contracted, and some of the incidents usually occurring before, during, 
and after their solemnization, followed by an account of the founding of academies, 
manual labor schools, and of the State University. 
In this region, as doubtless was the case in all other rural communities at that 
period, youth of both sexes, whatever might be their pecuniary circumstances, were 
required to spend a greater or less portion of the time at work. In families with 
narrow means this was necessary. Children when not at school worked habitually 
with the same regularity as ‘negroes or hired laborers. Indeed, the two or three 
years’ schooling gotten by them generally was spread through twice or thrice as 
many on account of times and seasons when their services at home were indispen- 
sable to sufficient cultivation of crops and work within doors. Seldom one of this 
sort attended more than three or four months in the year. It was often as surpris 
ing as gratifying to note the amount of learning acquired by boys and girls in 
cumstances so narrow. Difficulties enhanced in their eyes the value of what they 
had few and limited opportunities of pursuing. Many a lad with no more than these 
rose to much respectability for intelligence and some to high positions in professional 
life. So, too, even children of the better sort were required to work during the 
period of vacation from school. Few boys of any sort did not learn to handle the 
plow, the hoe, and the ax. While engaged on plantation work they labored never 
apart, but alongside of negroes, going to fields and returning at the same hours, 
their dinners being sent to them as to the rest. True, they were indulged in more 
frequent holidays, yet in many of these their friends among the poorer classes, par- 
ticularly on Saturdays, were allowed to join them in sportings with hounds, gun, and 
red. A people among whom were few who dearly loved mere money getting were 
none the less stringent of rule that their children should grow up with just notions 
of the importance of work and becoming respect for it. As sons of the more pros- 
perous grew older, instead of manual labor they were gradually inducted into the 
knowledge of supervising and in the disposition of crops when gathered. 
It was the same with girls, perhaps to a degree more stringent because of their 
closer confinement at home and in continual presence of work which industrious 
mothers of families saw needed to be looked after. Vestments of every sort, for 
whites as well as blacks, were cut and made at home. These, except the few for 
special occasions, as hereinbefore mentioned, were made of the produce of the plan- 
tation—flax, wool, and cotton. This work, the whole of it, was done in the mansion 
under the supervision of the mistress, and mainly by herself and her daughters. When 
portions were assigned to negro women or girls, it was of a kind needing less of spe- 
cial painstaking, yet requiring the mistress’ continual direction, for deftness with 
the needle and shears always seemed difficult for them to acquire.   
    
EVENINGS AT HOME, 
The interval between supper and bedtime was spent by the whole family together. 
If lessons were not already conned, children studied by a table, rendering and receiy- 
ing assistance when needed. This seldom occupied all the space, as the lessons were 
not unreasonable. Afterwards, if it was in summer, they sat together on the piazza, 
which hardly any house was without, until the hour of evening family prayer, that 
was seldom omitted if the father was a church member. A Bible chapter was read, 
a hymn sung, and then the prayer on bended knees, sometimes the latter seeming 
rather long to children and such of the servants as accepted invitation to be present; 
this was evinced when at its close they were yet on the floor, being overcome by 
sleep. In winter girls assisted their mothers in sewing and knitting for the family, 
white and black, and the boys helped the father in rolling into balls from brooches 
the thread spun during the day and reeling the balls into hanks. In times before 
the cotton gin, all picked apart the seed and the lint. So long used to this habit 
some became, that even after the gin was introduced some planters, when satisfied 
with reading, kept it up during the evening, unwilling to be entirely idle during any

portion of their working time. During the hours of sleep doors oftener than other- 
wise were left unlocked and windows unbarred. A man’s own negroes were trusted — 
as his children, Domestic police, as in patriarchal times, was in the family, and it 
was not very far from perfect. Children when at home were often allowed to play 
with much freedom with their coevals among the negroes; but only boys with boys, 
and girls with girls, and the latter only in daylight. In such plays the humbler 
indulged as much freedom as the higher, and the admission of defeat was as honest 
in the one case as in the other, although upon disputed points there was the same 
sort of wrangling or what was common to either race while contending apart. 
Elderly negroes who happened to be passing by took the same liberty as parents 
used in warning against extravagances of any sort, and a white child’s heedlessness 
to such interference, especially if attended with disrespectful words, were reported 
in the ‘white house” whither the giver was called and made render account. These 
persons were usually addressed as ‘‘Uncle” or “Aunt,” titles destined to last 
throughout life. 
This freedom of intercourse between children of both races, within limitations 
known to be prudent regarding the best welfare of all, led to benign consequences. 
Many of the most affectionate, long-enduring friendships existing in the South were 
between white men and their slaves, which began in childhood under supervision of 
the parents of both. It was quite common for two children, a white and a black, 
to become so attached, that the humbler grew up with hope of becoming that young 
master’s or that young miss’ slave when the time should come for the former to marry 
and go away with allotted portions of the estate. Not only they, but their families 
wished them to follow the fortunes of those who had been so long and so well 
beloved. To the world outside such separations seemed hard. Far more often than 
not they were in accordance with long-cherished hopes, and they served to enhance 
yet more the happiness of that naturally thankful and affectionate race. 
BOYS’ FIELD SPORTS. 
Out of school, children whose parents were of whatever degree of property hold- 
ing were indulged with holidays of reasonable frequency. Almost any Saturday a 
boy with his fishing rod, or with his gun and two or three hounds, would meet his 
likes similarly attended and spend the day along the margin of a creek or within 
fields and woods. Lesser game for a long time continued plentiful, such as squirrels, 
rabbits, opossums, raccoons, partridges, field larks, and particularly doves by the 
thousands. Any family, however humble, would have been ashamed to be regarded 
so poor as not to afford to keep several hounds. 
Boys who were too young to handle guns or follow hounds afar used to resort to 
devices for taking birds. 
Traps.—Perhaps never a Georgia boy, when come to 7 or 8 years, failed to have his 
one or more traps for catching birds. If he was lame or an invalid, a trap must be 
built for him and set somewhere in a meadow or near the woodside. It was con- 
structed of laths about 3 feet in length for the four at bottom, 2 inches wide, and 
a quarter of an inch thick, decreasing in length for about 10 inches. It was set. by 
three sticks called triggers, a long and two short, forming, when joined, the figure 4, 
placed horizontally with the stem atthe bottom. Around thisstem and beneath was 
strewn the bait—grains of corn, oats, and wheat. A very light touch sprang the 
trigger and the trap came down. The captive was taken out at the top by removal 
of the short laths in sufficient numbers to allow insertion of the hand and arm. 
Results from such huntings were very far from compensating for the work done in 
their behalf, but they were ever hoped and expected to be better the next time. 
They were far more satisfactory in the case of one bird in particular, the quail, called 
there ‘‘partridge.” Going in flocks, ingenuity was called upon to frame a trap so as to 
get all, which would certainly follow the getting of the first. The trap for this pur- 
pose was called a “coop.” It was similarly constructed, possibly somewhat heavier. 
ED 96. 27*  
-P-A-G-E-918
  842 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Instead of triggers its delusion was compassed by a tunnel, wide and horizontal at 
tho opening, about a foot or 15 inches from the coop, and after reaching it aseend- 
ing and narrowing until it opened rather abruptly within by an aperture of size to 
easily admit one bird and no more. Grain was scattered in profusion about the 
coop, more so in the opening, and extending through the tunnel. The leader of tho 
flock passed along tho wide, gentle slope, feeding as he went, the rest eagerly fol- 
lowing. Some grains were scattered upon the ground within in order to hinder 
apprehension from arising until all were inside. - In this condition it never oceurred 
to them to attempt egress through the same route by which they had entered. The 
tunnel’s opening inside being abrupt and darkened, the captive vainly strove to 
pass through the spaces in the sides and roof of tho coop. 
Day hunting with hounds and gun.—The hunting of squirrels and rabbits, doubtless, 
was about the same as in all other regions where these animals abound. It was 
pursued by half-grown lads regarded not yet old enough to overcome the awkward 
difficulties in chasing such as could be taken only in the night; or, as in the case of 
tho fox, at carly dawn and on horseback. Many a vain petition to venture, at least 
upon the former, was presented to mothers, and many a boy was made happy at 
the coming of the time when it was deemed not too imprudent to grant it. 
Hunting the opossum.—A sport which boys greatly delighted in was accompanying 
the negroes while hunting the opossum. Its relish was the dearer because of the 
infrequency with which parents, especially mothers, consented to it. Of all delights 
to the palate cf a Southern negro, and indeed of many a Southern white man, the 
flesh of the opossum, when baked to the proper degree of brown, is the dearest. 
Abounding in fat perhaps beyond any other animal, its flesh resembles much that of 
a sucking pig, only being more soft. It is so easily fattened that on being taken 
out of the woods it generally is in condition fit for the oven, Southerners regard it 
of all meats the least indigestible, and but for its superabundant fat it would appear 
more frequently om tables of the whites. In some houses this superfluity was dis- 
posed of by placing a layer or more of oak or hickory sticks to the height of 3 or 4 
inches at the bottom of the oven, and upon the latticowork thus made laying tho 
opossum. By such mode much of the oil was deposited on the bottom. The negro, 
when cooking for himself, never resorts to these measures, but takes his favorite 
as ho is, indeed preferring him with all his imperfections on his head. 
At every home, whatever might be lacking for making up the full of home com- 
. forts, is was never an opossum dog; seldom was it without two or three. These 
wero not of the pack of hounds—from four to eight and more—kept by the owner 
for the fox and the rabbit. They belonged to the negroes, and were usually well 
trained. The hunter, providing himself with an ax, a torch of lightwood sticks of 
suitable length (about 2 feet), accompanied by at least one other, bearing another ax 
and an armful of other sticks, sallied forth to the weods. Both he and his dog well 
knew the most-frequented haunts of the quarry, along skirts of wood and meadow 
wherein grew the persimmon, the muscadine, and the wild grape. A rabbit starting 
up attracted little notice from the dog, that understood well enough that that sort of 
game was for the day, never for the night. After the trail was found the pursuit 
was usually brief, as this beast is not swift of foot, and travels over an inconsiderable 
space. The dog barks little or none while pursuing, and so the opossum, when about 
to be overtaken by surprise, makes with what speed is possible to a tree. In his 
emergency he sometimes has to take to a small sapling, up which he can mount no 
higher than 6 or 8 feet without bending the top. If he is not too hotly pressed he 
will take to a large one, although he is not as particular in that matter as the 
raccoon, who, being more swift of foot and more capable in general of taking care 
of himself, invariably seeks the largest he can find in his flight. There was one 
exception, however, and that in the case of an opossum of smaller size, more slender 
of make, much more fleet of foot, and with preponderance of black hairs in his skin. 
Whenever it was a very large tree to which the hunter was called by his dog, he 
             
-P-A-G-E-919
    EARLY EDUCATIONAL LIFE IN MIDDLE GEORGIA. 843 
was apt to suspect that it was either a raccoon or a “ Blue Dick,” as this variety was 
called. Whether it was of a distinct species was not known. Individuals were not 
often met with, and a black hunter was always disappointed when one of them took 
the place of its betters, as, though small and thin, it cost more to take him and to 
fatten him afterwards. 
The “treeing” was announced by a bark peculiar to that office, and entirely differ- 
ent from others. There was no sound of cagerness, as in those of pursuit. It was 
one brief utterance of mere announcement, as if the dog had finished the task 
assigned to him and would now lie down and rest till his owners came up. If his 
bark was harkened to, he gave no more. If not, he repeated it at intervals until it 
was. Then he sat or lay while the tree-was being felled. Just before this crisis, 
unless the treo was very small, one of the axmen, quitting that work, repaired a 
short distance on the side opposite to that inwhich the tree was to fall and held 
him by the collar during the descent. This was done to secure him from being 
crushed by rushing too speedily among the branches. Instant upon the fall he was 
loosed, and, rushing forward, seized his game, nearly always before it could get to 
another tree. At that instant all excitement ended. A moment before the seizure, 
if he had it to spare, the opossum, offering no resistance, laid itself down and to all 
appearances died. This was regarded as an instinctive artifiee to attempt cscape 
from death by seeming to be dead already. It will fight with neither man nor dog, 
and at last seems to implore for pity and sparing of life to one so entirely submissive. 
This gave rise to the phrase ‘playing ’possum,” applied to persons suspected of 
making insincere ado about their own ailments or other suffering, or pretending to 
be asleep. 
"The way in which the captive was secured, if not novel, was curious, and singu- 
larly hard. A hickory stick of, say, 2 inches in thickness and 5 or 6 feet long was 
split at a small distance from ene end, and before the wedge was withdrawn the 
long, hairless, thick-skinned tail was drawn about half its length through the slit, 
after which the wedge was withdrawn. The captor slung the stick across his 
shoulders, trimmed his torch, and, if not ready to return home, hied his dog to 
another search. Occasionally a negro would return home, not too late for rest 
enough for the morrow’s work, with three or four hanging from his pole. 
The killing was usually postponed to a Sunday. During the interval it was kept 
in a box set with its open side upon the ground and made firm by heavy stones laid 
upon the top, ventilated by auger holes. It was fed upon persimmons mainly, but 
with addition of bread, coilards, potatoes, and other vegetables gotten from the 
negro’s small garden that iay behind his cabin. It was really surprising what 
degrees of fatness it would take on in a very short time. 
The killing was after a way peculiar tothatanimal. In all probability never since 
Georgia was first occupied by white people with slaves did an opossum, when killed 
by a negro, meet death in any other. For this time-honored custom he felt respect 
that would have been sorely hurt even by suggestion of substitution of another. 
The affection he cherished for this dear object made him scrupulous that when his 
end was to come, as it must come inevitably according to the destiny of all beings, 
sentient and not, it should be decently in accord with usage handed down from the 
ancestors of both. And so on afair Sunday morning, taking him tenderly, yet with 
sufficient firmness of grasp by the tail, he drew him from his box into the light of 
day, let him “‘go dead” for a while, after his harmlessly deceptive way, and, it may 
be, addressed to him some words of praise for the manner in which he had made him- 
self ready for the winding up of this his last job. Then, laying down his ax with 
the helve across the victim’s neck and placing his foot upon it near the space of con- 
taet, while he kept it pressed, with his two hands he pulled his tail until his neck 
was broken. Already a pot of water hard by had been made hot for scalding the 
hair from his precious.“ carcass,” by this time become, as some expressed it, ‘‘as round 
asa butter ball.” After he was baked and set upon a tray, flanked satisfactorily with

attendant good things, it was interesting to see the rapidity with which, using a 
fayored simile among negroes, it would “‘ go down de red lane.” 
Raccoon hunting.—Seldom was a young boy allowed to go upon hunt of the raccoon. 
It is a beast of considerable fleetness, extremely wily, and combative to the last 
degree. Probably of all animals, if not the most cunning in devices to evade its pur- 
suers, it is the most adroit and pertinacious in fight. Not one hound in a hundred 
could cope with it in single combat on land, and it required three and four to do so in 
water. A coon hunt of several dogs (and it required a pack) gave chase often a mile 
or more before the quarry was compelled to tree, and this, back and forth, winding 
right and left through the densest thickets that the fugitive knows best on the mar- 
gin of the creek. The tearing and soiling of clothes, inevitable to close following of 
hounds, made parents put a ban upon sons until they were well on toward manhood. 
Even grown persons, on account of the expense, seldom hunted them except for the 
purpose of lessening their ravages upon the young corn ears in adjoining fields, and 
never with intent to eat them. Occasionally a negro, for lack of opossum, would 
cook them and try to get as much compensation as possible for such lack. Generally, 
however, after taking the skin the rest was thrown away. Yet occasionally a hunt 
was indulged in for the sake of the excitement throughout, particularly at the close. 
Very often several trees, seldom not more than the first, had to be felled. One of 
the animal's devices was to take one tree in a thicket and, after ascending among the 
higher limbs that intermingle with those of other trees, pass stealthily from one to 
another. In such moyements it was interesting to note the competition of the lower 
animal’s instincts with theingenuity of man. Occasionally, by no means frequently, 
the quick ear of a hound detected the trick when a slender limb was bent by a pas- 
sage; but what was more to the purpose, the hunter might be able once in a while to 
discover the object of his pursuit by placing himself in the fairest position and 
then, having the torch put behind and lowered, peer up among the branches. The 
raccoon was in constant watch of its pursuers, and the glittering eyes reflecting the 
torchlight, betrayed its covert. When the tree fell, foreseeing it must be overtaken, 
it made haste for the nearest water, where a fight took place which really thrilled 
one to witness. Nothing could equal the celerity with which one and another of its 
enemies were bitten and clawed, amidst growlings of inteiisest desperation. The 
hounds howled aloud with corresponding pain and anger from repeated inflictions. 
On fit opportunity the raccoon, seizing one by the nose, dived beneath the stream, 
where it could remain considerably longer than the former. When it became neces- 
sary to rise, it loosed its hold and reappeared as far away as possible from the point 
of descent, and its latest adversary had to repair to the bank for a moment’s rest. 
From sheer exhaustion of defending against its numerous enemies it perished at last, 
yet often with its teeth and claws quivering in their flesh. 
Yet, it seems singularly noteworthy, as used to be solemnly declared by negroes, 
whose observations of habits among animals of the woods had extended through long 
periods and whose statements in that regard were in general entirely reliable, that 
in a combat between a raccoon and an opossum the latter, if of corresponding age 
and growth, invariably prevails. And it is thus: The opossum, shrinking himself 
into as small and round a ball as possible, makes his one bite; it may be the jaw, 
and it may be the shoulder, or a hind leg. Whatever it beit is a mouthful on which 
after fastening his teeth, jaw and all, he deliberately and with apparent entire res- 
ignation “goes dead,” and the assaults of his enemy of whatever numbers and vari- 
eties seem to have no sort of influence upon his corpse. It is as if a choice morsel 
had been locked within a strong box whose owner had gone away with the key in 
his pocket. When the raccoon becomes abjectly demoralized and by unmistakable 
signs shows that he is more than fully satisfied the dead comes back to life, opens 
his jaws, and the other makes off without unnecessary delay. 
This exigency is far worse when the raccoon is caught in part by a trap. If it be 
in a portion of his body not vital and to which he can apply his teeth, with these he 
cuts the rest of himself loose and leaves the other part to tell its own tale alone.

Plantation Fourth of July.—Among the yearly holidays anticipated most eagerly 
by children was the plantation Fourth of July. 
Independence Day, as many used to style it, always had its several commemora- 
tions. The principal one was held on the day itself in the villages, or, in districts 
too remote from those, in the meeting-house grove or near a cross-roads store. In the 
latter case an orator and a reader came from town, all surviving Revolutionary sol- 
diers were carried and sat in chairs in front ofthe audience and with women divided 
the eloquent praises of the peroration. Afterwards came the barbecue, for whose 
enjoyment juicy exhalations from pits wherein the ‘‘ carcasses” were nearing a proper 
finish for some time before made all mouths ready. c 
The other came on later, usually on the third or fourth Saturday of the month. 
This was the negroes’ ‘‘Fourthof July.” By this time the small grain had been 
harvested, cotton and corn received their third and last plowing, and the crop was 
pronounced to be “laid by” during the four weeks before the ripening. 
On this occasion things were put on early andkeptonlate. Pigs and lambs, accord- 
ing to the number in the family, were barbecued, supplemented by fowls and vege- ' 
tables, cakes, conserves, and other good things. Yet the scene most interesting to 
children was the cider beating. Apples brought in carts from the orchard were 
emptied into a long trough made of a poplar log, where they were beaten by men 
with pestles. A rude press was built and fastened to one of the trees in the groye, 
and on a layer of oat straw the pulp gathered in buckets was emptied, the long beam 
attached to the screw that pressed being drawn around bya horse or mule. The fun 
to children was in being allowed with long oat straws to suck the new cider from the 
trough. The dinner table was setin the grove. After the whites were served, the 
negroes sat down on their chairs and benches, when all, men, women, and children, 
did the best they knew how with the viands before them. When all could dono 
more on that line, the old foreman, called upon for a speech and unanimously denied 
being excused, said his say, and was followed by others among the men, who talked 
their talks, and by the half-grown boys and girls, who sang theirsongs. After dinner 
the aged and other adults sat around under the trees and looked on as the young, 
white and black, disported over the grove. Except Christmas and Christmas week, 
this was the whitest of all days in the year. It mattered not what had been the 
favorableness of the seasons and the general prospect of crops, on this day conditions, 
whether promising or otherwise, were put out of mind. Everybody was conscious 
that he had done his part faithfully, and knew that the same was felt by everybody 
else, so all gave themselves to enjoyment, willing to leave the future to the disposal 
of the Creator. With apparent reluctance the sun went down at last too soon. Yet 
often the moon at or not far from its full, or the heavens lit by starlight allowed the 
children to continue their sports till near the hour of 9, at which all must: retire to 
their beds. 
SWIMMING. 
No school was very far from some sort of swimming hole. At a proper distance 
from the spring the boys made a dam in the spring branch, whither they very often 
resorted. On Saturdays in time of summer they went to the nearest millpond. By 
the time one was 10 or 11 he swam as easily as the best. It is probable that not 
one in a thousand grew to manhood without learning this delightful art. Any- 
one felt ashamed when another said of him about this: ‘‘He can’t do anything; he 
can’t even swim.” It was remarkable what often could be done in diving, by long 
practice. Occasionally a boy remained under water so long that a stranger looking 
on might begin to apprehend that a serious accident had occurred, when, rising far 
beyond the place of immersion, his hearty exhalation gave assurance that all was 
right with him. Contests of endurance were very frequent. If the bathing hole 
was small the divers, one at a time, standing each with his back to the water, waited 
till a-stone suitable in size was thrown in, and the bubbling that might tend to betray 
the spot at which it had entered subsided. Then, plunging in headforemost, they
-P-A-G-E-922
  846 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
made search for it. If it was rather easily found a smaller was substituted. Not 
very many habitually engaged in a contest that necessarily imparted such discom- 
fort. Besides, many carried oft-repeated orders from home against a practice so 
hazardous, on pain, in case of violation, of losing permission to go into the water 
at all. 
Another thing of a very decidedly unpleasant character, often resulting from too 
long indulgence in the sport when the swimming pool was not entirely within the 
shade of trees, was burning the skin of arms and shoulders by the double action of 
the sun’s heat directly and through reflection of the water. The luxury of the sport 
was so delightful, especially in a mill pond which could not very often be reached, 
that sometimes boys lingered too long in braving this danger. As long as they were 
in the water no sort of indication of what was insidiously coming was given. Only 
apartial foretaste was given when they were drying themselves on the bank. But 
by the time they had reached home never a boy so beset who did not sorely repent 
that he had gone away from home on that day, or that he had not gone in a direc_ 
tion leading farther and farther from that mill pond. As soon as such an one got 
within 50 yards of the house, his mother, if happening to look that way, discovered 
in his red-red face what was the matter, and at once began to make ready for prompt 
dealing with the case. Sometimes, if it had been possible, he would have liked to 
conceal his predicament, enduring the pain, whose stinging severity none but the 
experienced can understand. Yet he would have sorely preferred this to the medical 
treatment. This was always as follows: 
On a bed, more frequently for greater convenience on a pallet spread upon the 
floor, the sufferer, after removal of his shirt, was laid flat on his front, his arms 
extended. Then at brief intervals during several hours the burnt surface was 
mopped with a goose feather dipped in a bowl of cream. The position, the silent, 
relentless sting, and, neither last nor least, the descent, along with feather and cream, 
of words of a kind most remote from such as soothes an invalid to hear, made his con- 
dition seem of all most uncomfortable. If not audibly, at least inwardly, he made, 
if for the third or fourth time, the resolve that never, no never while memory 
remained, would he be caught again in precisely that style.   
GAM 
  Ss. 
When children had arrived at the age approximating maturity, games conducted 
with animation often becoming rather noisy and boisterous were dropped, and others 
more quiet and subdued were substituted. In these both sexes joined, and behavior 
was of a kind to be expected of those who began to look forward to marriage. That 
period in the times now being considered came forward earlier than afterwards 
when travel increased, bringing larger numbers into acquaintance with one another. 
Country girls then often were fully grown at 15, sometimes at 14; matured by the 
latitude, good health, and abundant exercise. Boys were men in size generally at 
18. At this stage few parents were opposed to marriages when other things seemed 
suited. Among the young, choice of life partners was limited mainly to the imme- 
diate neighborhood, and this was seldom protracted beyond the twentieth or twenty- 
first year, as often as otherwise not beyond the nineteenth. When a girl at 13 or 14 
left off her pantelets and let her gown reach to her feet, the understanding among 
boys was that she would be apt to understand what he was hinting about when the 
theme was married life as compared with single blessedness. In such discussions 
the softer of course declared preference for the latter. Yet it was not uninteresting 
to listen to argument from her opponent, which being more persistent, strenuous, 
eager, and in time appearing more sensible, she suffered herself to become convinced 
by it. Marriage engagements were always brief, brought within as near limits as 
the suitor by prayers and tears could obtain. If the alliance was satisfactory to 
both families, they generally seconded his pleas. For there was no need to inquire 
_ about antecedents personal or social, nor about existing conditions. These were

already known. Perhaps never was a rural community in which were fewer secrets. 
Whatever occurred in neighborhood or domestic existence became known to eyery- 
body—beginnings of courtships, their progress, rivalries, probable results, dates 
of maids suffering themselves to be overtaken, engagements when to be consum- 
mated. Even rejections, although sometimes (not always) endeavoring, could not 
hide themselves; it was too good an item for other enamored youths to let lio in 
silence. Whenevera prospective marriage was kept secret it was because the parties 
to it knew of or apprehended family hostility, which, if it conld not be overcome, 
would compel to elopement. 
Mention has been made hereinbefore of the appreciation of leisure among the rural 
population of this region, adults as well as youths, married persons and single. 
Hospitality was regarded even a religious duty, and few were so poor as not to prac- 
tice it within, often much over the limit of their capacity. A few parties of pleasure 
among the young were frequent at all seasons. When dancing fell under interdict 
of the churches, resort was had to plays, of which there was quite a number, for 
mere conversation could not easily be substituted when none had read more than avery 
few books, which, however interesting, could not support oft-repeated discussion. 
Well-grown boys, well learned in the history of braye heroes described in the half 
dozen romances in vogue, essayed, with varions degrees of success and occasions of 
fitness, to imitate their language, and were laughed at by girls and rivals for appar- 
ent blunders, and so it was that very soon after meeting and exchange of usual 
inquiries and compliments, suggestion of plays met with favor. Descriptions of a 
few of the most leading of these are hereto subjoined. 
Criticism.—In this play one of the company, male or female, was assigned to a chair 
apart from the rest to be criticised. In the beginning, unless one volunteered or 
assented to suggestions to become the first subject, it was decided by lots. This 
however, was seldom resorted to, as more than one of the youngest boys showed wil- 
lingness to be made thus conspicuous. Then one of the company went around ask- 
ing everyone what the subject looked like, at the same time kneeling for the answer, 
which was whispered in the ear. After the round was made, the interrogator stopped 
and, looking toward ono and another, reflected several moments while fixing in ree- 
genio the various criticisms. If he could not clearly recall every one, a partial 
round was made again. After that he announced them to the subject, who had to 
guess at the names of his critics. If he failed of all, he had to remain where he was 
for another ordeal. If not, the one first properly guessed took his place. Announce- 
ment of failure or success, when occurring early, was not made until a full report was 
rendered, for in this the fun consisted. As a rule the critics liked to be known, par- 
ticularly when the declared similitude was complimentary. Between boys this was 
never the case; a boy subject never thought of attributing to one of his sort any 
except ridiculous comparisons with his inferiors. There were several that might be 
called stock phrases which were seldom omitted, because younger boys were par- 
ticularly fond of them, such as “‘he looks like a ram goat tied to a shavin,” a ‘‘sore- 
eyed kitten peepin’ out of a pan of buttermilk,” or ‘‘he would if he could, and if he 
couldn’t how would he?” Occasionally a lover hinted his feelings to his sweetheart 
by comparing her to the ‘Queen of Sheby,” when the comparison was announced 
exhibiting such consciousness as would remove doubts of the author; and it vexed 
him when she, dishonestly enough, guessed a small boy or a rival whom he hoped 
she did not care for. Girls’ comparisons, except in cases of little boys, were not 
usually very complimentary, nor did they aim so much at being funny, usually 
employing some phrase taken from a book. If a large boy got a high compliment in 
that way, he would be sure that it was not sent by the one he liked best, prac 
she had been made aware of his feeling. 
Thimble.—In this game, when all except one were seated about the room, she (in 
ease of a girl) holding a thimble in her closed hands, went around, and the rest, 
with theirs opened only enough to receive it if dropped within them, hoped each to 
get the compliment. Their hands, whether successful or not, were kept closed so    
       
-P-A-G-E-924

that no intimation could be made of the one who held it. The carrier said to each: 
“Hold fast what I give you.” When the round was made, the giver demanded of 
the rest successively to guess who was the holder. All who missed had to forfeit 
- something, as a fan, a pocketknife, a handkerchief, or something else. When these 
forfeits had accumulated to a considerable number they were redeemed in this wise: 
By a table on which they had been laid, one who was more often than otherwise a 
boy, was seated in a chair by its side. Then a girl standing behind held above his 
head so that he could not perceive it, one forfeit at a time, beginning with the 
words: “‘Heavy, heavy hangs over your head: What shall the owner do to redeem 
it?” The boy inquired: ‘Is it fine or superfine?” meaning is the property that of a 
boy or of a girl. The cost of redemption depended upon the humor of the seller and 
the character of the owner. Many a ridiculous thing was enjoined to boys, as to 
“cut the pigeon wing ”—that is, jump up and crack his heels together three times 
before returning to the floor; ‘to put his face in sucha shape as would hideas much 
of its ugliness as possible ;” to ‘‘ go to Miss Betty Perkins and ask her forgiveness for 
telling a lie on her;” to apologize to Miss Nancy Crother for saying she wasn’t nigh 
as pretty as she thought she was;” or ‘‘to how-to the prettiest, kneel to the wittiest, 
and kiss the one he loves best.” The last was sometimes a little embarrassing, as the 
debtor might not like to make public his sentiments, and if he chose, managed to 
conceal them by approaching indifferent)y the two who sat nearest for the honors. 
Then it was tantalizing, and so meant to be when imposed, as being sure that neither 
his sweetheart nor any other near her age would allow him to make payment in that 
wise, and so he took his kiss from one of the little girls. Yet, not always, unless he 
was near grown and was somewhat of a favorite among the younger sort. A half- 
grown boy’s advances were not seldom met with the turning her lips away or cover- 
ing them with her hands by the child he thus ‘proposed to assault; or she might be, 
if only 10 or 11, big enough to wish it understood that her kisses, considering it 
time to dispense with mere make-believes, had decided to reserve themselves for 
more becoming bestowal. Hearty laughs followed such discomfiture. It was also 
very funny and very nice, when a little girl, after suffering herself kissed by one 
she liked well, ran to the one whom she knew or suspected he loved best, and turned 
over to her what she had received, or she might bestow it mischieviously upon one 
who was not so known or suspected. There might be blushes of more than one sort, 
but the fun was cordial and loud enough to overcome all. When such a sequence of 
punishment was imposed upon a girl, the only hope of a boy to get a kiss was on his 
smallness and generally known good behavior, particularly his deportment toward 
girls in general. 
This was one of the favorites among both sexes, especially those approaching 
maturity. It became so because of its freedom from boisterousness, and the oppor- 
tunities it afforded for wit and humor, not counting out those for delicate hintings 
of serious intents and hopes on the part of individuals who indulged ideas of turn- 
ing from childish things, and passing to housekeeping. 
King and Queen.—This was not often played and never in its entirety by both sexes 
together. Two chairs were placed near one of the walls at a distance of the breadth 
of another between them. The whole was covered with a sheet or counterpane, and 
the king and the queen occupied the chairs, arranging the covering so as to make 
believe there was a seat between them. Attendants were on hand to introduce 
strangers and subjects expressing a wish to be made known to their majesties, who, 
on a holiday occasion, graciously condescended to give temporary occupancy of the 
seat between them, Upon introduction and invitation, the one presented, with 
humble thankfulness, turned and seated himself. At that instant the sovereigns 
rose simultaneously and the guest fell to the floor. The play was indulged only when 
a boy present had not been made acquainted with the trick, or so pretended in order 
that he might be the principal figure in the denouement. 
It is probable that the play thus rendered was of recent origin, differing widely

from another of the same name recorded in English books, which was as follows, 
taken from Mrs. Valentine’s work: 
“The company sit in two rows facing each other. There must be an even number, 
as 6,8,10,or12. One row personates a range of gentlemen with a king sitting at the 
end. The opposite row is to consist of ladies, she at the end being queen. The king 
numbers all the gentlemen 1, 2, 3,4,and they remember their number. The queen 
numbers the ladies, but all their numbers must be different from those of the gen- 
tlemen; for instance, if the gentlemen are 1, 2, 3, 4,5, the ladies must be 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
When all is arranged, the king and queen each call out a number. If the king calls 
No. 2, he who bears that title must start up and run all around the company, The 
queen must at the same time call out one of her ladies, for instance, No. 8, and the 
lady must pursue the gentleman all around, If she catches him before he gets to 
the king he pays a forfeit. They then resume their seats, and it is the queen’s turn 
to call first. She may call No. 10 and the king No. 4. The gentleman now pursues 
the lady, and if he catches her before she gets to the queen she pays a forfeit. Some- 
times in this play all the odd numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7, are allotted to the gentlemen and the 
even numbers, 2, 4, 6, 8, are given to the ladies.” 
Consequences.—Not often others than grown or nearly grown persons, male and 
female, together played at this. 
A leaf of foolscap paper was cut lengthwise about 5 or 6 inches in width so as to 
be easily folded. The first one to whom it was handed wrote, so as not to be 
seen by any other, the name of a gentleman. Carefully folding underneath, it was 
then passed. to the second, who wrote the name of a lady. After like disposal, the 
others, one by one, wrote brief sentences concerning relative situations and talks 
between the parties, The first, usually, was telling where they first met, followed by 
what he said to her, what she said to lim, what the world said about them, and so 
on to the last, who told the consequences. This was quite a popular play. Incon- 
gtuities, mostly absurd as possible, running through the history were often very 
humorots. Say the page ran thus: 
James Reeder. 
Susan Reynolds. 
They met in a brier patch. 
He said ‘Did you all have waffles for breakfast?” 
“Tl think of your proposal, and answer definitely later.” 
“Tt’s some cooler than it was yesterday.” 
“You are very much mistaken.” 
“You are handsomer than I was told.” 
“How this world is given to lying!” 
“The world said, ‘She might do well, and then again she mightn’t.’” 
Consequences: ‘A great deal of talk, but no cider.” 
Fishing.—In this play one, say a girl, stood in the floor holding a handkerchief by 
a corner, and bobbed it up and down as a fisherman does with hook and line. The 
others, fishes for the time being, went up and timidly touched the lower corner 
between thumb and finger. If he were not the one for whom she was specially 
angling, she jerked it away, and his disappointment, real or feigned, always begat 
merriment. When the favored boy bit she let the handkerchief fall into his hands 
and, if he were not too big, gave him a kiss. Then he whispered iv her ear the 
name of the fish he would select. This afforded much fun for the girls and little 
boys, the latter especially, because of the kisses they got from the grown girls, 
whom they would have preferred to girls of their own age, even if these had con- 
sented. What fun to the large boys was the witness of others’ disappointment at 
denials. In this all the girls, big and little, heartily participated, as well as the 
teasing of the big by the little boys with words pretendingly compassionate, as that 
if they only knew or even dreamed of what they had missed they would look even 
more sorrowful than they looked already. A play so near being one-sided the large

boys ere long urged to be changed to another that was more general in dispensing 
enjoyment, 
Tho foregoing constitute the principal games or, as they were almost always 
called, ‘‘plays” that obtained among the youth of the simple people. Those of 
higher-sounding names, such as ‘‘Tho bells of London,” ‘‘The Prussian exercise,” 
«Dressing the lady,” ‘The throne of compliments,” and their likes in the old country 
were unknown to them; nor were such as dominoes, games with historical cards, 
educational toys, croquet, calisthenics, charades, enigmas, rebuses. The pleasure 
gotten from those in their circle was abundantly sufficient. Set evening parties 
were not very frequent, because of the inconvenience of carrying and fetching the 
guests at night and the necessary lateness of the hours of retirement of these and 
the familiesat home. Yet when come to marriageable age they were frequent enough. 
The hour of assembling was ‘candle light,” and they seldom lasted as long as 10 
o'clock, an hour later than usual bedtime. In the frequent dinings, or rather 
“‘spending-the-days,” children had other lesser reunions. Added to this they were 
sometimes allowed to ‘‘go home” with one another for a night during the period of 
school time. 
Singing schools.—A much-favored occasion for the meeting of youths of both sexes 
was at singing schools. 
Instrumental music during this period may as well be said to have been none or 
thereabout. It was before the time of the.piano. Both the ruling religious denom- 
inations, in their proscription of the dance, virtually included the fiddle, its chief 
inspirer and indispensable concomitant. Now and then one got him a flute, but the 
emotion produced by the flute played by itself without other accompaniment, even 
when at its best, is rather negative, of a kind that suggests, even appears to yearn for 
something better. Of course it did never come to its best in such a society, or any- 
where within the neighborhood of it. The face of a flutist and the attitude of his 
upper limbs at first view seem rather pathetic, from the sad drooping of the former 
and the apparent beseeching of thelatter. These, when the sounds produced by them 
are common and less than common, might excite compassion except from the fact 
that sense of the ridiculous gets in before itand keeps itout. Many a man and many 
a woman, good and pious as any, regretted that their church discipline imposed 
silence upon the fiddle, yet they honorably held to observance of the precept to 
abstain from anything likely or decided to be likely to cause others to offend. And 
so thatrural people could not but content themselves with such music as was poured 
from their own and other singers’ throats, and a heartier and more spirit comforting 
has seldom been heard in castle or palace than in country meetinghouse and cot- 
tage. In earliest years children learned from their mothers hymns and ballad songs, 
which were sung often with marvelous melodiousness. 
Singing schools becamo notable institutions, being greater favorites in inverse 
ratio to the amount of culture in the community. Often, however, young persons, 
male and female, of the better sort, attended but mainly for the sake of a morning 
or afternoon’s recreation and willingness to help the teacher in eking out his preca- 
rious livelihood. The singing-school teacher, like the old-field schoolmaster, was 
unique, unpractical, and generally unfit for other employment. He made up his 
classes in communities extending over perhaps two or three counties, giving weekly 
or semiweekly lessons, twenty-four in number, at a dollar for each pupil. These 
were usually at the church or the schoolhouse. The pupils, of whatever ages and 
numbers, were all put into one class and drilled in what most of them already knew, 
the hymns contained in the hymn books. It was of some advantage, of course, to 
get the rudiments of singing by the four notes then used—mii, fa, sol, la, and to have 
the voice strengthened. by singing in chorus; and these were about all. Trifling as 
the tuition fee was, it paid reasonably well for the average education gotten by it. 
It was amusing to note the exalted ideas held by the teacher of the greatness of 
his art, evinced by the solemn circumstantiality of his announcements and direc- 
tions as, with both hands high lifted, working up and down, he walked or rather 
       
-P-A-G-E-927
  EARLY EDUCATIONAL LIFE IN MIDDLE GEORGIA. 851 
marched alternately before his three sections, treble, tenor, aud bass. Intheintervals, 
after mopping his face with his handkerchief, with ever-smiling countenance, he com- 
mented upon the last performance, expressing delight at the rapidity with which 
everybody was improving. There were alw one or two who had no more of voice 
or ear for music than a calf or ahandsaw. It might be a boy of 14 with what they 
called his “‘goslin squeal” on him, or one born without an atem of mu in his soul. 
Yet it would not have suited in any sort of wise to scold or severely critic He 
might get a friendly request to try to ‘‘pearten up” a little on his A’s or his D’s, so 
he could be ‘‘unanimous” with the rest on the last note. Lmudierous to the last 
degree were the efforts of such a singer, mostly serious yet occasionally out of pure 
desperate fun, to make satisfactory compliance with this reque: At such times, of 
those who understood their business some would frown and stick their fingers in 
their ears, or pause for a few shakes of irrepressible silent laughter with handker- 
chiefs stuffed into their throdts, but afterwards, intent upon decorum, make up by 
yet higher and more gushing strains. 
Not every teacher was himself possessed of voice suited to good singing. Educated 
musicians recognize of course that this is not at all essential to competent teaching. 
Yet on one occasion it served the purpose of a plea to an action in one of the courts 
of the State. This case used to be rehearsed with much humor many years ina 
company of gentlemen by Joseph Henry Lumpkin, late chief justice of the supreme 
court. 
It was thus: An old gentleman, close, yet meaning to be honest in all his ways of 
saving and increasing his very moderate estate, was persuaded, much against his will 
and judgment, by three of his children, to let them enter a singing school. They were 
supported by their mother, a faithful church member, who took it much to heart that 
not even a simple hymn could be decently sung by a single member of the family. 
The father maintained that singing was not in the family at the start, and in his 
opinion if it wasn’t in them then it could never get there afterwards. But he was pre- 
vailed upon, and the children punctually attended every lesson, from beginning to end 
of the term, when, as the father contended, and the poor mother had to admit, that, 
if anything, singing was farther off from that family than ever before, and he flatly 
refused to pay the teacher’s bill of $3. To the latter’s threats to sue, he answered 
that he might sue and welcome, just as soon as it suited him. Action was speedily 
brought in the court of the district justice of the peace, Itseems almost a pity that 
not more of the rulings of those old-time judicial magistrates were handed down. 
Their jurisdiction on money claims extended to $30, and issues of fact were decided 
by a jury of five. The office, somewhat like that of the schoolmaster, was sought by 
none except from that sort who were unfit for any other calling, and whose love of 
notoriety was quite above their learning and capacity. It was often amusing to see 
what turn the judicial mind sometimes felt itself called on to take. In this particular 
case the defendant was aided by a young man who at odd times was reading Black- 
stone’s Commentaries with some hope of being a lawyer. Such men, or any others, 
could practice in justices’ courts without license. This‘one putin apleaof “failure of 
consideration,” in that the services rendered by the plaintiff were wholly without 
value to the defendant, and because the said plaintiff did not do and was not com- 
petent to do himself what he undertook and promised to teach others to do; that he 
did not teach defendant’s children to sing, and could not do so because he knew not 
how to sing himself. 
The plaintiff proved his case by several witnesses and submitted to the court. 
Defendant’s counsel, in his opening speech, announced that maxim in the law requir- 
ing that in all issues of fact the very best evidence possible to be obtained should 
be adduced. His honor was assured that that long-established dictum was well 
known to all courts, including the honorable court before which he now stood. 
Then in proof, in best proof, of the justice of the defendant’s plea, counsel would 
respectfully claim that the plaintiff be required by the honorable court to sing, if

he could, any song that he might choose to undertake. The plaintiff seemed appalled 
and disgusted, and the bystanders looked at one another, silently asking if such as 
that was so or not so. After revolving the subject for a few minutes with solemnest, 
seyerest scrutiny, plaintiff was ordered to rise and do his best. In vain he pleaded 
to be excused, on one and another ground—absence of all expectation, incipience of 
cold, matter of his singing having nothing to do in the case, etc. Yet not daring to 
disobey the order, he lifted up what voice he had and began. Before he had gotten 
through the first stanza the court, putting one hand upon his ear, and with the other 
taking up his pen for the entry on his docket, said mournfully yet firmly: 
“That'll do. For the good Lord’s sake, that’lldo! The plaintiff has proved the 
case against his own self, and he is onsuited.” 
SUNDAY MEETING DAYS. 
The longer a man reflects upon it the more just and reasonable seems the remark 
of a great divine (Dr. Chalmers, if rightly remembered), that the vices springing 
out of a single campaign of a great army are more numerous than those from all 
other sources during a whole generation. In the beginning of war prayerful per- 
sons, including many who are not so, become more instant and earnest in invocations 
to the Deity to forefend or to shorten and mitigate apprehended disasters. As the 
struggle goes on and becomes intensified with suffering of various sorts, those least 
steadfast begin to suspect that Heaven either hears not or regards not their beseech- 
ings; and so the temptation is either to doubt the existence of any Almighty Power 
that takes cognizance of human affairs, or to regard it as hostile or at least indiffer- 
ent. And so in time, growing desperate, they become prone to indulgence of natural 
evil proclivities. Such is the case after long-continued devouring pestilences. 
Witness the plague in Florence in the period from 1328 out of whose desolation 
Boccaccio picked materials for the Decamerone. The war of Independence ended in 
the attainment of that for which it was waged, but it led to much license in moral 
conduct and indifference to religious obligations throughout the whole country. 
The duello for a time was frequent, as well on Boston Common as at Bladensburg 
and grounds farther South. Trust in an Almighty Being and Its merciful heed to 
continued humble supplication yet remained among women, but men in general in 
this region, so distant from enlightened centers, were sadly indifferent in the mat- 
ter of religious opinions and practices. In this state of things rose a set of young 
men, sons of devout women, whose mission, despite some extravagances natural to 
existing conditions, wrought speedy salutary changes. 
One thing that made the endeavors of those uncultured clergymen more efficacious 
was the partisan zeal with which they combated in support of their several forms 
of religious faith and dogma. In the absence of those of the Church of England,* 
1 Hostility to the British Government naturally involved the like to the Established Church. Of 
tho few clergymen within the Province, supported as they had been by the Society for Propagating 
the Gospel in Forign Parts, some withdrew. In the convention of February, 1777, wherein the first 
constitution of the State of Georgia was ratified, one of the articles made clergymen ineligible to the 
legislature, another changed the names of the old parishes. The following is taken from Stevens's 
History of Georgia, Vol. IT, p. 299: ‘Tho old parish of Christ Church, in which was Savannah, and a 
part of the parish of St. Philip were set off as a new county and called Chatham, in honor of the elder 
Pitt, the venerable Earl of Chatham. The parishes of St. David and St. Patrick were created into one 
county and called Glynn, after the eminent counselor of that name. The parishes of St. Matthew 
and tho upper part of St. Philip were to be known by the name of Effingham, after Lord Efingham, 
who had refused to employ his sword against the Americans, and resigned the colonelcy of the Twenty- 
second Regiment rather than serve with it in the war of tho Revolution. ‘To the parish of St. Paul, in 
which Augusta was situated, was given the name of Richmond, in honor of the Duke of Richmond, 
who had boldly advocated the cause of America in the House of Lords. The parish of St. George 
was named Burke, after that great commoner and wise statesman. The parishes of St. John, St. 
Andrew, and St. James were to form ono county, under the name of Liberty, a distinction awarded to 
the parish of St. John for its carly and steady devotion to the cause of frecdom. ‘The parishes 
of St. Thomas and St. Mary were to constitute another county, by the name of Camden, after the 
distinguished lord chancellor of England and firm friend of America.

EARLY EDUCATIONAL LIFE IN MIDDLE GEORGIA. 853, 
Baptists and Methodists strenuously sought to establish each their own, the former 
wholly independent of the mother church, the other at first claiming to be a society 
within its fold instituted for the purpose of developing a more fervent devoutness 
than that which had seemed to become habitual not only among the laity but the 
priesthood. The Methodists at that time, following the example and the words of 
Wesley, claimed to be not a church, but a society in the old church. The disputa- 
tions between the two denominations were often quite acrimonious; occasionally, 
when conducted by men of unusually limited education and understanding, quite 
ridiculous. Yet among the leaders were a few men of large abilities, as Lovick Pierce, 
Hope Hull, and Bishop Andrew of the Methodists, and Jesse Mercer and the Mar- 
shalls among the Baptists. In these disputations, wherein examples of piousliving 
were necessary to the most earnest and eloquent argumentation each must so ordi- 
nate its discipline as to advance its claim to be fashioned by thatset up by the disci- 
ples of our Lord. They thus became, as it were, rivals in denunciating certain 
habits and customs which of old time were regarded, if not entirely innocent, at 
least venial. But now such as dancing, card playing, horse racing, even moderate 
use of what they called ‘‘cuss words” were branded as moral sins, whose last end 
was subjection to endless fire and brimstone. 
In none of this warfare was a spirit of cant. Clergymen of both parties were 
men who, of whatever degree of fitness for public preaching, led “upright lives, 
earnestly desiring the weal of others and honestly believing their teachings to be in 
accord with the will and the instructions of the Master whom they strove to serve 
with all their heart. From such endeavors, helped on by such examples, blessing 
must always come. They served at least to moderate excesses, and, what was more, 
to crush out the infidelity which, among other misfortunes, the war had produced. 
In that later generation, if any at all, might be counted on one’s fingers the number 
of those who did not believe in God and the incarnation of Christ. 
Public religious services were held only once a month, on a stated Sunday, prefa- 
tory to which, on the day previous, church members were expected to meet their 
pastor at the church. After a sermon he descended from the pulpit, took a chair at 
its base, and, not as pastor but as presiding officer (styled moderator) of the monthly 
conference, called the members to order for the transaction of business. This con- 
sisted mainly in the hearing and settling of misunderstandings between individ- 
uals of the congregation, reception of new members, examination of charges against 
delinquents, expulsions when found guilty of conduct unchristian or otherwise 
violative of denominational rules. These were Baptists, who in rural districts far 
outnumbered the Methodists, although the latter had corresponding advantage in 
villages. 
It was curious the variety of issues that were discussed in this Saturday confer- 
ence. The denomination believed literally in the injunction against Christians 
going to law with one another for the settlement of business disputes, and while 
they did not inquire officially or interfere in those in families, yet they did not hesi- 
tate to act upon them when brought to their notice by an individual party. Even 
a husband or a wife was liable to be summoned, provided (otherwise not) they were 
both church members. Every separate congregation was an entirely independent 
body, and democratic in its constitution. The pastor had no power except as pre- 
siding officer. Questions were decided by vote of the male members, which in some 
cases, particularly in the admission of new members, must be unanimous. In cases 
more than ordinarily difficult of settlement, invitations were extended to other con- 
gregations to send delegates to assist in the discussion, but these were advisory 
only and not allowed to vote. In one of the old counties was a case of this kind, 
where the preliminary issue was whether a witness who was not a church member, 
however credible and otherwise competent, should be allowed to testify for or against 
one who was. After repeated meetings of conference, some of which were extended 
to four or five hours, and assisted by delegates from sister churches, it was decided. 
 
-P-A-G-E-930

in the negative. The main issue was between a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law. 
Another was of an old husband, for many years a leading member, who instituted 
a charge of disobedience against his old wife because, contrary to the express 
injunctions of the Apostle Paul upon all wives, she had flatly refused at his orders 
to break away from the home whereat they had lived in reasonable contentment for 
fifty years and follow after him, who had lately taken up the resolve to move into 
another county. The issue, through management of the most thoughtful among 
the members, was not allowed to come to trial, the complainant being dissuaded 
$ from his unreasonable demands, z 
Singular as this court was, sometimes, rather laughable for the eccentricities in 
both trials and judgments, it settled many disputes that otherwise might have been 
prolonged and ended in unhappy results. It served to make parties to business 
transactions more fair and circumspect, and it further served to render less wide 
open (occasionally to shut) the mouths of the gossip and the busybody. Young 
members, who were in attendance because, rather than for better reasons, they were 
obliged to be at roll call or render a satisfactory excuse 2 month hence, used to have 
their patience sorely tried at what to them seemed useless discussions, which their 
elders thought well often to prolong until the fast-descending sun gave warning that 
dusk was near at hand. Some of the women, young and old, although without vote 
or speech unleSs when called upon to defend themselves or testify for others, rather 
liked them, as it was the only opportunity extended to them of listening to speechi- 
fying of other sort than a sermon. 
But Sundays! Few scenes were more interesting than gatherings on Sunday 
mecting days. Persons dwelling within a circle of 6 and 7 miles’ radius were sure 
to attend unless prevented by providential or other insurmountable hindrances— 
men, women, children, nursing babies, all. The few who owned family carriages 
put their wives and youngest children in them; the same with gigs and other humble 
vehicles drawn by one horse. Fathers and grown-up sons and daughters traveled 
on horseback. Those without any of these went on foot. But this was almost 
neyer. Carriage horses, gig horses, saddle horses, plow horses, mares with young 
colts, and mules bore the throngs along the highways, whose clouds of red dust in 
summer time busied fans all the day and brushes for many minutes after the return 
home. Almost none would have been content to be left out of these monthly pro- 
cessions. Even the colts and mules exhibited much interest, the former ii dashing 
along in all conjunctions with the grown-up horses, while their dams kept up unre- 
mitting whickerings in apprehension of harm to their reckless coursings, and in 
occasional answering to the call, giving signs of wishing to take brief luncheons, 
and then, finding things not ready, dashing off again, never with idea as to whither 
their legs would take them; and the mules, eternally braying, their sorrowful com- 
plainings sounding as if they were inquiring what was the purpose of all this ado, 
and what, if anything, was to come of it. It was a sight to move a good man’s 
heart to see the shifts. that the humblest had to make to avoid being cut out of enjoy- 
nent of the sweets of this, which, no matter of what color the others, was a white day 
in the month. Good women, of whatever degree of property, would have felt keenly 
the hardship of compulsory detention at. home by young children or other hin- 
drances. Often a family of several made the trip in this wise: On the back of a 
mare, followed by her colt, rode the head of the family ; on the pommel of the saddle, 
his hands holding to the mane, rode the youngest but one; behind, on the saddle 
blanket, rode the next older. On another mare, accompanied by her offspring, sat 
the wife; alternately on her knee and her arm was the latest born, and behind was 
the oldest of the four, boy or girl, as (in the language of the law) the ease might 
be. Bound to get to meeting somehow, they were thankful for this in absence 
of more convenient and showy conveyance. No housewife was without one nice 
gown anil fit accompaniments for the occasion. Perhaps a majority owned at least 
one black silk, whose service was extended through many seasons. This “Sunday

frock,” no sooner had the wearer returned home, was removed, carefully dusted, 
scrupulously folded, and tenderly laid in a chest, wherein, from time to time, were 
sprinkled fresh layers of rose petals, leaves of apple, thyme, and lavender. Its 
companions were a glistening pair of prunellas, wrapped in soft paper, the long 
white embroidered cape, a tortoise-shell comb, elaborately hemstitched handker- 
chiefs, starched petticoats, “bought” stockings, gloves, and ribbons. On a shelf, 
high above, a bandbox held the leghorn bonnet or green ¢alash, resting upon which 
was a fan made from a turkey tail or two wings of the white heron. There these 
dwelt in silence until the next meeting day in course. 
Arrived at the meetinghouse, with its oak grovo of several acres spotted with horse 
blocks for convenience of feminine equestrians, all alighted, fastened their beasts, 
and then in twos or moro made for the spring at the foot of the hill. By the time of 
returning, the preacher entered the house followed by the others. On one side of 
the long, broad middle aisle, to which two others somewhat narrower ran parallel, 
sat the women, the men on the other. Very young boy children were allowed to sit 
with their mothers for the sake of more efficient care of them when overtaken by 
somnolence during the invariably long sermon. Nursing children were usually kept 
by their nurses outside in the shadow of the trees, but were brought in without 
hesitation to their mothers when in need of nourishment. The cry of ono of them 
in church occasioned no surprise and little discomfort, as it was only a brief while 
till the mother rose, or the listening nurse came in and took it away. 
The congregation diminished in devotional fecling with the increase of distance 
from the pulpit. If the younger and moro volatile was a boy, the more he was apt 
to make for a back seat, unless forewarned against it by parents. There they could 
ogle their sweethearts, take naps in less notice, and in waking moments seek immor- 
tality, at least for tho initials of their names, by cutting them on the benches. Sing- 
ing was always by the congregation, the clergyman lining the hymns. Indistinct- 
ness of hearing the words made little impediment to the heartiness with which they 
weresung. Of singing that inspired the heart, it is not often that one wassounded 
more genuinely sweet and musical than this. Enjoyment-was so heartfelt that more 
often than otherwise the two concluding lines of the last stanza wererepeated. One 
who has long survived such scenes recalls them with much fondness; sights and 
sounds, gentle waving of fans and handkerchiefs, humble, fervent prayers, sermons 
long, yet burning with unction, songs in multitudinous chorus of spirit and under- 
standing, among smells wafted from simply perfumed vestments all whose exquisite 
sweetness, seemingly a part of the worship of the Almighty, passed with his youth 
to return no more. 
It is no less than wonder to recall the benign results of these meetings conducted 
by unlettered men, most of them planters. Some of these, although not scholarly, 
were of excellent understanding. Because of this, and their good reputation and 
influence, they were chosen by their denominations, and the choice was ratified, 
inasmuch that almost always without exception the leaders fully trusted that the 
“calls” which they claimed to have gotten from divine sources were sent. Yet occa- 
sionally was a curious specimen, sv much so as left many to suspect that those eails 
to which they responded so promptly were intended for somebody else. Those men 
could manage to string along scripture texts and common platitudes through an 
honr, and an hour and a quarter, and then backdown with apparent regret that 
their voices and physical strength and the attention of their hearers forbade fur- 
ther elaboration of the heavenly delightful theme. Some of such men, to the last 
degree upright in character and blameless in deportment, wholly unconscious of 
their unfitness for expounding the Holy Scriptures, held on through periods of thirty, 
forty, fifty years, delivering about the same sermon on texts extending from the 
beginning of Genesis to the end of Revelations. In those periods thousands on 
thousands were brought into the Church, to live thereafter lives as free from reproach 
as could be found anywhere. Every congregation of course had its own pastor, who 
 
-P-A-G-E-932
    856 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
generally served as many as four, giving to each one Sunday and the foregoing Sat- 
urday. The pecuniary compensation paid for such service was surprisingly small. 
Sometimes the clergymen were possessed of more means, as they were more intelli- 
gent than their flocks. Such men expected littleif any compensation, and no assess- 
ment was had in any case; members when contributing at all doing so according to 
their several degrees of liberality and sense of proper obligation. The lesser lights 
who had no stated engagements, at intervals, when the work on their little farms 
did not overpress, took their jades from the plow, and, sending to the denominational 
weekly paper lists of appointments, were wont to sally forth on a fortnight’s mis- 
sionary tour, taking in besides meetinghouses a few of those of prominent brethren 
along the way. During this journey, in which they never would have been allowed 
to pay out a centif they had had one in their pockets on leaving home, small sums 
at each meeting were silently made up, garments newly made of domestic produce 
and manufacture, amounting to full suits, were bestowed by good women, their 
beasts got shoeing and were well fed and cared for generally, and both were happy 
and thankful when, with their several accretions of fat and sleek, they got back 
home again. 
Yet, however interesting these public exercises were to most of the congregation, 
with the younger sort they did not equal the scenes to take place when they were 
over and the congregation dismissed. It was many minutes before began disper- 
sion. Men, more especially women, who dwelt so far apart as to meet only on 
these occasions, lingered to shake hands, ask and answer questions about family and 
neighborhood happenings, exchange congratulations of babies’ looks, commenda- 
tions of their behavior during the services, or excuses and apologies when it had not 
been of the best. Yet beyond these were the opportunities, the very best of all, for 
courtships. Rapid and animated were the rivalries among young men and boys to 
become escorts of girls on the return. Permission if not granted before was quickly 
begged atthe door. Seldom a girl rode back with her father or mother or brother. 
Another, a declared beau, or not, went for her and his own nags, with which, meet- 
ing her at one of the horse blocks, seating her, and mounting his own, together they 
started on the ride to her home, he always on the left, she onthe right. The gait at 
which travel was made depended in some measure on the interest she felt in his soci- 
ety. They looked their best and had on their best things. It would have been gross 
neglect of hospitable duty on reaching her home not to invite the escort to alight 
and remain for dinner. Itis probable that a majority of marriage engagements in 
rural regions three-quarters of a century ago dated from those horseback rides in 
couples on Sunday meeting days. In such courtships, ardent as brief, brief as 
ardent, lovers had the advantage which some critics ascribe to Romeo in his suit to 
Juliet in that the latter was not his first love. The argument is that the conquest 
of Juliet so quickly after first sight and approach might have subtracted from our 
respect for her delicacy in being too easily won. To prevent this Shakespeare gave 
to Romeo an experience which was of infinite service in his present suit; this was 
to make him in love first with Rosaline, in pursuit of whom he had learned what of 
courtly words and manners do not suit, and striven to acquire those that do. After 
Rosaline was lost he knew better, than without her help he would have known, how 
to woo the daughter of Capulet. 
Whatever was of importance in such preliminaries, an old-time Georgia boy not 
more than one in a hundred times was without them. At 13 or 14, sometimes less, 
he imagined himself in love, and it was nearly always with a female already mar- 
riagable. Ashe grew older, and at a rate whose slowness was disgusting to himself, 
his aspirations became more reasonable, and he studied carefully how to talk and 
behave, when in fit season he became a lover in earnest. Along highways leading 
between those country meetinghouses and the homes of marriagable girls, lovers 
through several generations of long ago told their passion and pleaded their pleas. 
Their language was not gotten from Shakespeare and Spenser, with whom they had

not made acquaintance, but many a tender morsel from the Mysteries of Udolpho 
and Children of the Abbey was rolled under and from the tongue. Those to whom 
they were addressed listened with smiles, never with chiding, and not often with 
answer in kindred phrase. If this did not win in one case it was sure, unless too 
oddly and inaptly mixed, to win somewhere else. Ludicrous to the last degree as 
some of these courtships were, they abounded not Jess in heartiness; and whatever 
the results were to be, prompt were the announcements. Such things as unneces- 
sary delays suited no occasion, either in business engrossments or in romance. 
Among a people whose educational opportunities and the periods of using them 
were within such narrow limitations early marriages must prevail. Two or three 
years’ schooling, strung along as it usually was in several installments through five 
and six, was, in general, the limit. After this boys of 17 and 18 and girls of 14 and 
15 went to steady work on their several lines. By the time the former reached legal 
majority they were either married or, as was generally decided, they ought to be 
before very long. By this time, often two or three years before, that matter, pro- 
vided parents assented, had been settled. “Indeed, silent understandings to mate 
were often had during school time between lads of 15 and lasses a little younger. 
Every boy and girl within a narrow circle knew every girl and boy therein and none 
besides, and so their mating, like birds in the wood, began with attainment of 
puberty; and all, of whatever property condition, must have publie solemnization. 
None other than runaway matches took place at other hour than candlelight. Cards 
of invitation were never or rarely ever issued. When the date was agreed upon 
(almost always a Tuesday or a Thursday), it became known to everybody in the 
neighborhood in a day or two, and the bride’s father or mother, on occasions of 
meeting such of their acquaintances as they wished to attend, gave verbal invita- 
tions that often included the whole family. From the date of the engagement to 
this the interval was brief. The universal sentiment of the community favored this. 
“If you are going to marry, marry,” were the words of friends and relations, even 
parents, with additions such as these: ‘‘Don’t be dangling along until people get 
tired of talking about you, and you get tired of talking about yourselves and each 
other.” The bridegroom was always for an early day. To the bride it often seemed 
more delicate to have to be persuaded. With all of the romance, all, old and young, 
recognized the seriousness of the business part, for the couple, no matter in what 
condition born and reared, were expected after thirty-six hours to go to work like 
other people. 
The wedding.—Betore sunset guests commenced to assemble. Ladies after alight- 
ing went into the house, and some busied themselves with assisting the bride to robe 
and the mother in preparing the supper table. The men, after tying their horses to 
horseshoes, swinging limbs of trees, and fence corners, assembled -in the front yard 
and discussed neighborhood topies and the prospects of the couple. Lighting of 
candles was the signal that the great eventful moment was approaching. Outsiders 
hurried in without delay, each with aim to get as nigh the couple as possible, with 
special intent to see how the bride was standing the “racket,” Of course they were 
sure the bridegroom was all right, and, as they often expressed it, ‘‘bold as a sheep.” 
The first to enter were two little girls bearing candles in candlesticks burnished to all 
sible brightness.. These were for the preacher to read clearly the license author- 
izing his part of the business. As they approached they separated, turned, and he 
rose and stood between them. The ceremony was brief in the midst of solemnity as 
profound as that at a funeral. At the close the preacher bestowed a few words of 
counsel, generally, if he were not wholly without humor, ending about thus: ‘There 
are two times when a married woman ought to stay at home; one is when her husband. 
isaway from home.” Waiting a moment or so for her to take this all in, he added: 
“The other is when her husband is at home.” Then rose laughter from all mouths, 
for the jeu @’esprit, although old as the oldest, was ever new for the many things it 
was meant to let go. All, oldest and youngest, highest and humblest, shook hands    
    
    
      
     
   
 
-P-A-G-E-934
  
  858 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
and spoke hearty congratulations. When these, over and over again repeated, were 
passed, then the supper. From houses miles and miles around had been borrowed 
knives and forks, glasses and crockery, chairs, and syllabub stands. If tables could 
groan, as some poet imagined, the grief of those beneath old-time wedding suppers 
must have been wholly disconsolate what time they were made to stand and endure, 
The strongest (indeed, if it could be called strong) drink was syllabub, a froth 
made of sweet wine and whipped white of eggs. With those experienced in grog 
and sweetened dram, it required tumblers on tumblers to help down the quantities 
on quantities of good eatables. At furthest, by 10 o’clock guests were departed, and 
in a few minutes longer the family, with its new addition, retired. 
Yet, in all this gay assemblage of country folk usually, at least quite often, there 
was one whose feeling it was touching to note, one who not always, indeed who 
rather seldom, appeared elsewhere than in the dining room, and not always there, 
unless there were not another on whom with entire trust she could devolve super- 
intendence. To her the loud, merry chattings and laughter imparted sadness whose 
relief was silent prayer and tears. Consent to the match, however unreserved, hopes 
for the bride, howeyer abounding, her prospects however bright in the seeming, the 
addition of the bridegroom, however welcome, were not enough for the mother in 
the beginning of that period of change and separation. It was inevitable, yet upon 
the goer and her new guide it was a benediction. 
Infare.—Next day came the infare, dining (if not at convenient distance apart) of 
both families together at the house of the bridegroom’s parents. It was pleasant to 
note the ideas of the complete coalescence of the two young persons united in one 
according to the laws of the Creator and the State. That the union was to con- 
tinue throughout their joint life none ever had a doubt, for this was regarded as one 
life, ever inseparable except by the hand of Him who had ratified and consecrated 
it. There is yet, here and there, living a man or woman who remembers the first 
libel (as the suit was named in the laws) for divorce in the State, and the sentiment 
of awe and repugnance with which its publication was met by all classes. It was 
brought in another portion of the State, and even to this date has had few successors 
in middle Georgia. 
After the infare the newly married were expected to repair to the home provided 
for them. Henceforth the wife wore upon her head a white cap, both abroad and at 
home. Almost without variation her domestic work was inaugurated by cutting 
and making, without assistance from any other, a shirt for her husband. Any bride, 
however young, would have felt ashamed of incompetence for this task, preliminary 
to the others to come in married existence. 
In this and the foregoing chapter the writer has endeavored to give sketches, as 
faithful as possible, from his own and his elders’ reminiscences of the early school 
and vacation life of boyhood and girlhood in middle Georgia, and of their passing 
into manhood and womanhood, to be speedily followed by marriage. Brief and 
simple as were the preliminaries to this last consummation, it was done with sense 
of all its responsibility and tho vicissitudes to be strewn along the unseen way 
before those who, with joined hands, were starting upon it, yet in cheerful hope of 
obtaining the goods allowed to be expected by the upright and industrious. 
  II.—ACADEMIES. 
The period from the old to the new was not long. The peculiar conditions of that 
early society, described in the first of this series of papers, soon made apparent to 
the common sert—what had been all along in the minds of the upper—that educa- 
tion of a higher grade than that gotten from the old-field schools must be provided 
for youth. The one to give embodiment to the sentiments of the people of this and 
all regions of the State in that behalf was a young man newly come from Connecti- 
cut, of which he was a native—Abram Baldwin. But consideration of him and his

work must be postponed to a subsequent part of this chapter, in which some account 
will be given of the founding of the State University. In this will be noticed the 
earliest academies, the rise of which was hastened by the efforts exerted by him 
upon a more extended field. It will appear hereafter how wise and benign were his 
endeavors, and that they fell short of fulfillment because of his premature death 
and the lack of other equally competent leadership. 
At the very beginning of legislative movements toward education, movements 
which, as will be noted hereafter, were on the wisest, most liberal scale, the country 
beyond the Oconee River, the western boundary of middle Georgia, was oceupied by 
Indians. The State was without available resources, yet, foreseeing that in time 
these would become vast, it began to lay foundations on which to build as these 
should materialize. Those movements began in 1785. The following year, at a 
place called Shoulderbone, in Hancock County, on the hither side of the river, a 
treaty was made with the Creek Indians. This did not prevent an occasional mur- 
derous irruption into that and Greene, the adjoining county. Yet, thirty years later, 
in 1815, an academy was incorporated in the village of Powelton, about 25 miles, and 
not long after another at Mount Zion, in the same county, 15 miles, east of that 
tiver. Within a short while these two academies rose to a degree of success and 
efficiency that in some respects have not been surpassed by any others since risen in 
the State. A number of planters, of well-descended ancestry in the older States, 
cordially joined by others who had become developed in thoughtfulness and intelli- 
gence by contact with them, having accumulated property to justify the proceeding, 
contributed to erect in these villages large and commodious buildings, and then, 
through advertising in Northern journals and by correspondence, succeeded in secur- 
ing teachers of the highest degree of competence. Several of these planters, leaving 
their plantations to the management of supervisors, moved their residences into the 
villages for the greater convenience of schooling and for supplying board to the 
youth who, as they foresaw, would be sent from other communities. 
The teachers, without exception, came from New England. More conspicuous in 
that regard than all others was Vermont, to which, three-quarters of a century 
ago, middle Georgia became bound in a debt of gratitude which it has always 
gratefully admitted. A series of men, all of whom, with one exception, were natives 
of Vermont and alumni of Middlebury College, came to these two villages wherein 
they put and conducted academical instruction on a scale equal to any at that period 
in the whole North. The one exception was Salem Town, a native of Belchertown, 
Mass., where he was born in 1779. For several years he was master of the Powelton 
Academy, which in time rose to have near 150 pupils, more in number than the 
inhabitants, white and black. Boys and girls in the neighborhood as far as 3 and 4 
miles outward, on foot, on horseback, some in vehicies called Jersey wagons, came 
from home; others from distant communities in that and other counties near and 
remote attended as boarders. A very large number of those who afterwards rose to 
distinguished positions were educated by him. He was destined to become far more 
famous as an author. In answer to a work appearing in 1822 entitled System of Spec- 
ulative Masonry, he published in 1828 Reviewed in Freemasonry, Its Pretensions 
Exposed, ete. During the time he remained in Powelton, he taught orally the prin- 
ciples which afterwards (in 1836) were published in that well-known volume, 
Town’s Analysis of the Derivative Words in the English Language. Admission 
of this fact appears in the preface to the book, which has run through many, very 
many editions, and which is still used by many teachers. Before the publication, 
he returned to the North, and for forty years longer taught in the State of New 
York. Here he wrote and published other school books, as Grammar School Reader, 
aseries of readers, Speller and Definer, Chart of Elementary Sounds, Speaker and 
Reader, and several more besides. Allibone, in his Dictionary of Authors, says: 
“Of the readers, more than 1,500,000, and of the Speller and Definer, nearly 150,000 
coples were issued (in Boston) in three years, 1857-1860. The series is recommended 
 
-P-A-G-E-936
  860 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
by more than 1,000 authorities.” Below this occurs the following note: ‘Over 
1,000,000 copies of Town and Holbrook’s Progressive Series, published by Oliver 
Ellsworth, of Boston, are printed yearly.” (Amer. Lit. Gaz., Sept. 15, 1864.) 
In this, the first academy of much note in that region, it was remarkable the 
~ interest taken by the people without distinction of class. A society democratic 
from the beginning, in which the humblest were made to indulge aspirations equal 
to the best, came forward in support of what became soon the object of its chief 
pride. Treated as equals in the old-field schools, and to a degree of equality in 
social life, youth of both sexes changed to the academy with assurance of like enjoy- 
ment of freedom in the larger opportunities put within their reach. Even those of 
straitened means dwelling at a distance were able by some straining to meet the 
small expenses of board and tuition. The former, abundant and excellent, inelud- 
ing lodging and laundering, was gotten for $8 and $10 a month. Tuition was $8, 
$12, and $16 for a term of twenty-two weeks, which was as sure to run through its 
whole length as the sun to continue to give his light by day. A little more than 
$100 would carry a pupil, even in classes most advanced, through the entire scholastic 
year of forty-four weeks. 
It has always seemed strange, and no less unfair, that teachers in schools among 
modern peoples, even those most accomplished and competent, have been paid for 
their services fees so little when compared with those received in other professions. 
Certainly, the work ef a capable master of a school who has been made entirely 
qualified for it, who well understands all of its many duties and responsibilities, and 
who honorably devotes himself to the performance of them, the greatest and the 
least, is of very highest importance, and perhaps is of all, when thus considered, 
the one most exhausting to health of body, mind, and spirit. A doilar a month in 
the old-field schools was in most cases as much as the service therein rendered was 
worth, and the laborer escaped such exhaustion by never overworking himself, 
either in the preparation or cultivation of the one little field rented to him, and by 
his frequent outings, when his portion of the gathered crop was unsatisfactory to 
the owner, and he went away in search of another. What exhaustion was ia him 
other than that in a natural way wrought by time coexisted with the beginning of 
his professional career. It was not possible for him to dwindle into a smaller com- 
pass than that in which, # his start, he was inclosed. Like some insects, he was as 
big at his birth as he ever became afterwards. 
That compensation for the services of such a man as Salem Town would seem 
more strangely inadequate to the work done if it had not been general throughout 
the whole country, and if it had not received so little increase down to this date. 
Workers in other professions are paid according to the comparative worth of their 
professional services, and the comparative importance of the ends for which they 
are employed, little to the untried and the ordinary, larger tu the experienced and the 
distinguished; but teachers for the most part must be content with graded pay, 
beginning low, and never rising high.! Yet, with a commuuity in a most fertile      
    
   
    1Jn ancient Athens difference between the lowest and highest grades was much. Masters of ele- 
mentary schools, besides being usuaily regarded with little respect, were paid next to nothing, while 
the rhetoricians and sophists demanded large sums. In Professor Becker's Charicles occurs the fol- 
lowing: “Advanced instruction was imparted by teachers of a higher order, the rhetoricians and 
sophists, whose ch rges only the rich could defray. Thus Aristippus demanded 1,000 drachmas (about 
$150 of onr money) and, according to Plutarch, Isocrates required a like sum; and when Demosthenes 
offered him 200, with the understanding to take only a fifth part of the course, he answered: “0 Demos- 
thenes, we do not important work in pieces; as the finest fish are purchased whole, so I, if you wish 
to learn, must give you my full course.” 
‘That was a scene to be pictured by an artist, the poor, wheezing, stammering young Demosthenes 
applying for entrance into the school of the great Isocrates, whom Cicero compared to the Trojan 
wooden horse, because of the number of eminent Grecks it had educated and poured out upon their 
country, and offering a fitth part of the fees for a fifth portion of the instruction. It was, however, « 
pardonavle departure from the usual modesty of the illustrious rhetorician in reminding the boy by 
answering that the best fish in the market were not cut Into slices for purchasers, but sold entire. 
Regarding the higher class of schools among the Romans, the same author, in Gallus, writes, “ We 
       
       
-P-A-G-E-937

region, whose simple wants made comfortable living easy to be gotten, those fees 
were accepted by the best teachers without complaint or attempt to have them 
increased. 
Town’s successors for several years were without exception Vermonters—Baptists, 
and graduates of Middlebury College, Otis Smith, Lucius Whittle, and others. Of 
these the one to become most distinguished was the former, who was as prominent in 
the pulpit as at the head of theacademy. Accorded the degree of doctor of divinity, 
he was for several years president of Mercer University, founded by the Baptists at 
* Penfield, to which, with others of its kind, reference will be made hereafter. Lucius 
Whittle, perhaps as a scholar more erudite than his predecessor, unfortunately, as 
was believed from disappointment of his hope to marry a young lady, his country- 
woman and teacher of the classes in music, partially lost bis understanding, left the 
school and the village, wandered to the West, and was never again heard from. Then, 
in 1835, came in a native Georgian, Simpson Fouché, long celebrated as a teacher 
and disciplinarian. For, by this time, the profession under the conduct of those New 
Englanders had been lifted above the repugnance created by their predecessors, the 
old-fielders. 
During all these years this school was coeducational. Boys and girls from 8 to 18 
lived in the same families and recited in the same classes. In forenoons and after- 
noons they had their quarter of an hour’s recess alternately and their separate play- 
grounds. Besides occasional small gatherings at private houses, not seldom one was 
had for all in the long music hall of the academy, sometimes given by boys and girls 
alternately, and sometimes by both jointly, the former contributing bonbons pur- 
chased at the stores, and girls substantials from their mothers and hostesses. Two 
or three Saturdays in the spring fishing excursions made up of both sexes, with one 
of the townswomen for matron, were made to the Ogeechee River, a mile or so dis- 
tant, or they went nutting in the uncut woods or gathered berries in the fallowed 
fields. Despite the decay of the old village, lads and lasses yet repair to the same 
ground under the red oaks and hickories. Theschool has never had a blot upon the 
name it obtained and carried during the seasons of its greatest prosperity. From 
its foundation four score years ago, until now, when it is conducted by that excellent 
scholar and gentlemen, Prof. Samnel N. Chapman, it was never stained by a single 
scandal. Salutary have seemed always competitions among and between the two 
sexes. Associations permitted under guidance of a discipline which, both in school 
and in families, was no less prudent than generous, stimulated to emulation for high- 
est possible development of understanding, and for practice of best deportment among 
gentlemen and ladies. In the State of Georgia, and in the two States, its daughters, 
beyond the Chattahoochee, are to-day great numbers of descendants from happy 
unions, first thought of which, although not often yet put in words of solemn avowal, 
had their beginnings in class and other reunions at this time-honored school. 
About the same time, in the village of Mount Zion, 10 miles to the southwest, was 
begun another academy destined to become equally famous with that at Powelton, 
one of whose masters came to be more widely known than any other that ever taught 
in the State. He was Carlisle P., younger of the brothers Beman, who came to 
are not aware what the pay for tuition amounted to; at all events, it varied a good deal, and in the 
elementary schools was very trifling.” (Juy., vii, 288.) 
Tt appears from this satire that Quintilian, the most illustrious rhetorician of his time, received 
what would be about $50 or $60 of our money. 
        
Quintilian gets and hardly gets ten pounds, 
On education all is grudged as lost, 
And sons are still a father’s lightest cost. 
Of the school of the poorer Palemon, the poet ends his compassionate words thus: 
Where ropy vapours Virgil’s pages soil, 
And Horace looks one blot, all soot and oil, 
Even then, the stipend thus reduced, thus small, 
Without a lawsuit rarely comes at all.

Mount Zion, the leading citizens of which were Presbyterians. In theirnative State, 
Vermont, they were of the denomination of Congregationalists. As there were no 
congregations of these anywhere near by—perhaps nowhere in the State—they became 
affiliated with Presbyterians, from whom they differed in nowise except in the mat- 
ter of church government. The elder, Nathan, a man of highly brilliant parts, 
established his famous academy, but after some years returned to the North and 
resided for the remainder of his life in the upper portion of New York State. His 
second marriage was with the mother of the distinguished William L. Yancey, one 
of the principal leaders of the secession movement in the Southern States. The 
younger remained, like his brother, became a doctor of divinity, and although 
inferior to him as a divine, as a teacher, during more than forty years, became well 
known throughout the whole South. As large a number of distinguished men went 
out from this academy as from that in Powelton, nearly all of whom were taught by 
these two brothers. Carlisle for a few years was president of Oglethorpe University, 
founded at Midway by the Presbyterians, but, preferring to teach without super- 
intendenco of trustees, he gave up this position, for some years conducted one at 
Lagrange, then returned to Mount Zion, where he continued to teach until he became 
an oldman. Wherever he went pupils followed him. His school was large whenhe 
went into retirement. Like the rest of his countrymen who remained in the State, 
he became entirely devoted to its interests. Their descendants fought and some of 
them fell in the Confederate war. 
Within a few years afterwards Putnam County, immediately west from Hancock, 
with the Oconee River between, having been relieved of the Indians, another Ver- 
monter and Middlebury graduate came from Brattleboro and raised to high repute 
an academy just founded at Eatonton, the county seat. This was Alonzo Church. 
He had not been there long when he wasmade professor of mathematics and astronomy 
in the State University, afterwards its president, and so continued for thirty-five 
years, at the end. of which advanced age and infirm health led him to resign. He 
was aman of commanding presence and courtly manners. He and his family were 
perhaps most efficacious of all in that beautiful town of Athens in imparting to its 
society a tone which was not surpassed by that of any village in the whole South. 
Its influence extended far and wide, particularly throughout the adjacent counties 
of middle Georgia. 
Yet later, about the year 1833, two academies for girls were founded and became 
justly famous, that of Sereno Taylor, another Vermonter, at Sparta, the county seat 
of Hancock, and that of Miss Br tt, a lady from Massachusetts, at Washington, 
the county seat of Wilkes. To these noted schools largenumbers of girls came, not 
only from that and many other counties in the State, but from Alabama and Missis- 
sippi. Unfortunately, both of these institutions when at their highest suffered sorely 
from the departure of their principals—Mr. Taylor, from the pressure of debts con- 
tracted by too large expenditures in behalf of his academy, and Miss Brackett by 
marriage with Dr. Adams, a well-known Presbyterian divine, of Massachusetts. 
Neither of these schools were ever able to maintain afterwards the reputation and 
patronage before held by them. 
A rather curious circumstance served to weaken the hold of Mr. Taylor, particn- 
larly among the patrons near by, and it is another illustration of the hostility felt 
by both of the leading religious denominations for one musical instrament in par- 
ticular, The organ, the piano, the harp, and the seraphine had reasonably cordial 
welcome in the schools, and the piano in families. But the violin continued to be 
feared as before when the Baptist and Methodist divines first began to cry out against 
dancing, a sin which this instrument was suspected to have been devised by the evil 
spirittoencourage. Mr. Taylor, whose appointmentsin music, judging from the num- 
ber of excellent pianists who were educated therein, were perhaps more complete 
than those of any other school in the State, then and afterwards set high impor- 
tance upon the violin, which, although a Baptist clergyman, ho himself played at 
his concerts, occasionally taking it with him even to the Baptist Church on Sunday

mornings when he was to preach. The members, few in numbers, while all of them 
did not approve, made little complaint, for the music was wholly of a devotional 
kind and of high excellence. Yet several rural denominations expressed serious 
objections, and one day a committee from some of them called at the academy and 
respectfully, yet seriously, remonstrated with the principal. He listened to their 
admonitions with his well-known amiability, made no promises, and when they were 
gone continued to do ashe had done before. A rather unpractical person in mat- 
ters of business, the houses he built, the high salaries he paid to his assistants, and 
the numbers of musical instruments he purchased involved him in financial trouble, 
and the property holders of his own religious faith declining to come to his aid, he 
was obliged to suspend. 
Discipline in the academies of Powelton and Mount Zion in the case of girls, 
although firm and exacting, was regulated by moderation. The spirit of good lady- 
hood, with constant prudent oversight both of parent and teacher, aided by instinctive 
delicacy in shrinking from merited public exposure and censure, served to restrain 
the willful and excite even the indolent to emulation. The same can not be said in 
the case of boys. Rigor in the old fields, hard as it was sometimes, yet had inter- 
vals of respite, partly from caprice, partly from general senselessness and lack of 
earnestness in its inflictions, and partly from weariness in punishing, with seldom a 
pulsation of passion or principle, or recognition of need of its unresting continuance. 
But in those academies, notably at Mount Zion, Discipline (it merits a capital letter) 
in full armor strode along, never resting, never hasting, as Goethe says, ‘‘like astar.” 
To boys from 8 years to any number under legal majority, rules, and they were not 
very unreasonable, were put, punishment for violations of which when detected were 
as sure as from the unalterable laws of the Medes and Persians. The ferule disap- 
peared except for an accidental mild application upon the palms of little girls. But 
the hickory, long, sinewy, solid, keen, and wiry, was plied with vigor, understood to 
mean that this operation was one of pure, dutiful, solemn, indispensable business, 
omission or abatement of which was never to be thought of. It was meant to hurt 
the outside primarily, but also to push its way inside through thick and thin to 
whatever was or could be made sensitive to pain in the interior. Resistance was 
seldom offered, even by the biggest and most daring. Those masters were as 
intrepid as they were resolute in discharge of every tittle of what they regarded a 
duty which no brave, honorable man could shrink from. Besides, as in the older 
schools, they were sustained by parents, guardians, and the whole public. Many a 
youth of 17 and 18 was sent there mainly for the discipline, which was reputed to 
be stricter and stronger than that which he had been able to resist or parry else- 
where. Expulsions and withdrawals were almost none. The hickory was trusted 
to be better and more benign than the former, and when a boy betook himself away 
without leave and was brought back by his father its application was doubled, for 
the first offense and for the last. In a village with fewer inhabitants than students, 
this discipline was deemed necessary to extend itself outside the academy. The 
system tended doubtless to produce, by provoking it, unlicensed behavior, especially 
under cover of night. It was always surprising how little of this escaped detection, 
sometimes even in the midst of its perpetration. Those New Englanders seemed to 
have made a study of schoolboys, and found them out through and through. It was 
said that hardly ever a student was found able to withstand Dr. Beman’s searching 
examinations. Not that the mischief done was of a kind base or malevolent. It 
might be a game of playing cards, moderate circulating of a flask of whisky, lifting 
a vehicle from its running gear, a gate from its hinges, or a brace of fowls from the 
roost. Of these the one first named seemed to be regarded most atrocious, It seems 
now almost incredible how condignly this game was condemned by many, even intel- 
ligent and theughtful persons. Struggling for leadership between the religious 
denominations led to anathemas of this with dancing, fiddling, chicken fighting, 
horse racing, and the like, that were common throughout that region thirty years 
before. Yet card playing, comparatively noiseless, held on to some sort of existence

in secret. Few children whose parents were church members or regular church- 
goers had ever seen a pack, and then only when wrested from the hands of an 
offender, white or black, for some negroes had learned the game of old sledge and 
were fond of indulging it on opportunities. Most of the merchants, from deference 
to general sentiment, did not keep them for sale; the others compromised by warn- 
ing purchasers of their danger when used beyond moderation. Persons yet living 
can recall the awe yet also the fascination with which for the first, perhaps the only 
time during childhood they looked upon that long-haired, weighty-crowned, out- 
landish-vestured, bloody-eyed despot, the king, and that brazen-faced, loosely-clad 
female, the queen, possibly a portrait of the Scarlet Woman foretold by the holy 
prophets, and yet more, that flat-headed, red hatbanded, short-breeched, striped- 
stockinged, high-heeled-slippered monster, the jack. Surely, surely, this must be a 
picture of the bad man, although they could not remember ever to have been told that 
his name was Jack. Among crimes less than felonies, so to speak, yet punished with 
more or less severity according to frequency of recurrence and detection were the 
chewing and smoking of tobacco. Consequently few boys by the time they got into 
their teens had not learned to practice one or the other. 
It may seem curious that this system of espionage and unreasonable punishment 
obtained so long. It was practiced even in the State University, at least fora time, 
during the presidency of Dr. Moses P. Waddel, who had been for many years head 
master of the academy at Williston, S.C. In the Sketches of Athens, Ga., by Dr. Henry 
Hull, occurs the following: ‘‘ His administration of the university was singularly 
successful. From the handful of students he found, the attendance increased to 100 
or more, and for ten years, with wise counsel and inflexible discipline, he kept the 
institution ever advancing. He thought the students of the university not too good 
for correction, and used to whip them without compunction when he deemed the 
punishment needed. An entry in his diary, still extant, says: ‘Caught—chewing 
tobacco. Whipped him for it.’” 
Gen. Robert Toombs often told of his last day’s experience at the university when 
under Dr, Waddel. His guardian, Thomas W. Cobb, who was then a Senator of the 
United States, sent him to the university when he was about 14 years old. One 
night while he and another student were engaged in a game of cards in his room, the 
tutor, whose office it was to keep watch upon the occupants of the buildings, came 
upon them in the act. It so happened that Mr. Cobb, who lived in the adjoining 
county, was in Athens. Toombs knowing well that the tutor would report his find- 
ing the next day, and that at the afternoon meeting of the faculty he would be 
punished, repaired to Mr. Cobb’s room at the tavern near by, and reporting the cir- 
cumstances, preyailed upon him to send a letter to Dr. Waddel asking a dismissal. 
Next morning early he took the letter to the doctor’s residence and got the desired 
paper. Later in the day, going forth and back during the removal of his goods, 
quite unexpectedly he met the doctor, who at once began to berate him for what he 
called “taking the advantage of him.” The boy cut him off in this wise: ‘Dr. 
Waddel, perhaps you do not know whom you are addressing in such language. I 
am not, as you seem to suppose, a student of this university, but a citizen of the 
State of Georgia.” Once, when Toombs had rehearsed the story at a village tavern 
in court week, one of the lawyers asked w reply was given? 
“T didn’t hear it,” answered Toombs, “for [immediately turned away and made for 
the tavern and Mr. Cobb.” 
Many scenes, some of them desperate and well nigh tragic, used to be told of school 
and of college times in which teachers, although occasionally in great peril of life, yet 
infused with intrepid resolution and supported by public opinion, prevailed. Truth 
is, that during that period occasionally was a youth who seemed to feel, like Achilles, 
that laws were not made for such as him. Such sentiments were exasperated by the 
existing policy. In time it passed away, and its results made people wonder that it 
could have continued so long.

    EARLY EDUCATIONAL LIFE IN MIDDLE GEORGIA. 865 
As for the courses of studies in those academies, they were as near being perfect 
as in any others in the whole country, South and North. Each pupil who was. 
advanced beyond the first elements had three regular studies, never less, seldom 
more. Forenoon recitations in spelling, reading, and in grammar—English, Latin, 
and Greek—were not counted among these; history, natural philosophy, and chem- 
istry were. Among the last mentioned chemistry was the favorite, and because of 
the peculiar way in which the text-book was constructed. There yet survive a few 
who recall with ease and even with fondness Mrs. Marcet’s Conversations on Chem- 
istry, of which, although an English production, more than 150,000 copies were sold 
in the United States. Many of the most eminent scholars gave high praise to if. 
Added to the accurate instruction imparted by it, much piquancy is in the conversa- 
tions themselves between the instructress, Mrs. B., and her two pupils, Emily and 
Caroline.! 
Comstock’s Philosophy was studied by quite a number; but of the two Mrs. 
Marcet’s work was far above it in favor. 
The abundant excellence of these Vermont masters showed particularly in math- 
ematics and Latin and Greek. It was simply impossible, and no pupil more than 
once or twice attempted to escape detection of want of diligence in preparing reci- 
tations. With those naturally dull, who were satisfactorily industrious, they were 
patient and sympathetic. For the idle and negligent they had no mercy, and it 
was wonderful the quickness with which they were able to discern. None were 
allowed to advance without thorough acquaintance with whatever was to be left 
behind. Classes were frequently changing in numbers, because whoever could not 
keep up with the average was reduced to a lower, and whoever could get ahead 
was required to do so. Of everyone was exacted work according to capacity to per- 
form it by faithful application. In classical studies, Valpy’s Greek Grammar and 
Adams’s Latin Grammar, lessons in which were recited every morning, were required 
to be learned from cover to cover. Fifty y after that period old gentlemen 
together recalling the latter especially, sometimes merrily contended who could 
recite from it word for word the greatest number of rules, observations, exceptions, 
notes, etc., and tell the sides of the pages right or left wherever they occurred. 
Boys were prepared for the freshman, sophomore, occasionally the junior class in 
the university. Whenever one from either of these academies was presented by 
letter from the master, faculties, taking their fitness for granted, sometimes dis- 
pensed with other than partial examination, not seldom, when some not very impor- 
tant things could be made up in private, admitting to a class above the one 
applied for. 
Not all, perhaps not a majority, of those educated at these academies went to the 
university or the colleges; many had not taken classical studies. Yet the years 
spent in such as were preparatory for business purposes only, contact with those 
pursuing the higher, and then the experience of a lofty, exacting, yet just disci- 
pline and continued serious work of master and pupil, developed both vigor and 
thoughtfulness in understandings that otherwise might have gone to waste. Many 
a wild, willful youth, his habits being conquered, rose to be a faithful student and 
afterwards a steady useful man. These masters did not expel. Their settled belief 
was that it was better to keep and continue efforts to reform the evil-minded than 
to drive them out to bea curse upon society. Many such a one in after life admitted 
his obligations to discipline that saved him from ruin.   
   
    1 Sydney Smith was a dear friend of Mrs. Marcet. Lady Holland tells an anecdote of a conversa- 
tion between the two while at a dining party. They were discussing in a semiserious way the exist- 
ence of purgatory. Mrs. Marcet appeared to be rather in favor of the dogma, when Smith playfully 
said to her: 
“Well, Mrs. Marcet, if indeed there is a purgatory, let me tell you what in my opionion will be the 
punishment assigned for your greater purification. You will be everlastingly putting questions to 
Emily and Caroline, and they will everlastingly be giving wrong answers.”

Such things as holidays might he said to be not so much as thought about, much 
less hoped for. Festivals like Easter, Whitsuntide, Ascension, Michaelmas ceased 
from people’s mouths, and not only their recurrence became unnoticed but their 
meaning unknown. Once in a series of years a day of solemn fasting was set apart, 
in hope, by this and congregated supplication for divine deliverance, to be saved 
from the consequences of long-continued dry weather, but the denial of food and drink, 
except such as boys and girls could furtively get from cupboards, for fourteen working 
hours from sun to sun, made it seem to many a wretched sham of holiday, and they 
were glad when it was over. The school opened on the second Monday in January, 
and closed with two days’ public examination at the end of the twenty-second 
week. After four weeks’ vacation it reopened for alike other term. Pupils regarded 
it a hardship that the Fourth of July came in one and Christmas in the other. The 
average of daily sessions was seldom less than eight hours. 
Such is a running account of those academies. The blessings imparted by them 
were incaleulably numerous and benign. If there was an exception, it was not 
avowed, and hardly known, to the rule, to be set down as universal, that the men 
who conducted them were remembered with gratitude and pride.

Noteworthy seems the fact that of those eminent New Englanders who led the 
earliest movements toward higher education in middle Georgia, nearly all were 
Middlebury College men. Some of them have been mentioned previously by this 
writer, There remains yet another who, although graduated from Union, spent the 
first three years of his college course there. This was Rev. Adiel Sherwood, born at 
Fort Edward, N. Y., of a family several of whom were distinguished for services 
rendered in colonial and Revolutionary times. In 1818 he removed to the State of 
Georgia, where, with the exception of a few years while holding a professorship in 
Columbian College, Washington, and the presidency of Shurtleff College, he remained 
until after the Confederate war. In 1865 he removed to the State of Missouri, dying 
in St. Louis in the year 1879. He became a learned, eminent divine among the 
Baptists, and was much admired and honored by people of all religious demomina- 
tions. Assoon as he had become settled within the State he began to devise schemes 
for the better education of the Baptists, particularly their clergy. He was the mov- 
ing spirit in the formation in 1820 of the General Association, which afterwards 
became that powerful organization, the Georgia Baptist Convention. It now scems 
singular that such a movement was not received with promptest cordiality. This 
was on account of the prejudice among many of that simple country folk against 
high education of the clergy. The argument was that the Apostles, who were the 
greatest preachers the Church ever produced, had little, almost no education, but 
became what they were by sole dependence upon the sustaining grace of their 
Divine Master.!- What sufficed then ought to suffice now. Indeed, it had seemed to 
1 Although an uncommonly grave person, he put down in his diary some rather ludicrous instances 
of the dense ignorance of a few of the clergy in districts where education was next to none. Oneof 
them announced from the pulpit that our Lord had been beheaded by the Pope of Rome, and another, 
mistaking the word meet, asked him what his opinion was about the sort of meat for repentance 
spoken of by St. Paul. 
In the history of tho Baptist denomination compiled for the Christian Index, Atlanta, 1881, occurs 
the following: 
“The necessity of education among many of the early Baptist ministers of Georgia was most 
apparent, and this partly explains the persistency of our fathers in their determination to establish a 
seat of learning. * * * One of their strange arguments was, ‘If learning is to help the preacher, 
why not pray to learning instead of to the Lord.’ Some of them claimed to be inspired to preach, 
averring that as they rose in the pulpit they had given their text no consideration until that moment 
when they opened the Bible, and that they intended to preach just as the Lord handed out the message 
tothem. * * * Humphrey Posy, being invited to preach for Joel Colley, who was for twenty years 
moderator of the Yellow River Association, took for his text St. Paul’s assertion ‘I am not ashamed 
of the Gospel of Christ,’ and observed ‘If Paul, a learned man, was not ashamed of the Gospel, I ought

be so, for in the denomination were a few preachers with very high oratorical powers 
who had had no schooling beyond two or three years’ attendance at old-field schools 
and had educated themselves at home. Therefore men of education were forced to 
move slowly and cautiously in the formation of larger bodies wherein it was fore- 
seen that they must necessarily act the leading parts. The resolution of Dr. Sher- 
wood was offered through another. In a letter written in 1870 in answer to one lately 
received from a relative in which was the question why he had so acted, he answered, 
“Tn the resolution for forming the Georgia Baptist Convention I do not remember 
any desire or end than the advancement of the cause of truth and the salvation of 
sinners. The resolution was handed to C. J. Jenkins,' as he was popular and I was 
regarded an educated man, which you know was considered an impediment in the 
opinion of some in those early times.” 
The original plan of Dr. Sherwood was to found a school for the education of 
young men for the ministry, and have manual labor connected with it. Brought up 
on a farm in New York State and working upon it in the vacations from college, he 
had become thoroughly acquainted with farm operations and was eagerly anxious for 
manual labor, at least in agriculture, to be mingled with general and professional — 
education among candidates for the Gospel ministry. In his diary for the year 1829, 
published in the Memoir by his daugbter,? is the following: 
“In that year (1829) I presented to the executive committee of the convention a 
plan for a manual-labor school for young ministers, but nearly to a man were they 
opposed to it. Perhaps Judge Stocks? was my only fellow helper.” 
Not discouraged by this first failure, after waiting two years he brought forth his 
scheme again. Quoting from his diary again we have the following: 
“In 1831, at the regular session of the State convention, held at Buckhead, Burke 
County, I brought up my motion, deferred on the advice of the executive committee — 
for 1829, for a manual-labor school for young ministers. Brethren Mercer, Armstrong, 
and Sanders, some of the most influential in the State convention, opposed the meas- 
ure, but Thomas Stocks, John Davis, and Absalom Janes,* and others, supported me 
in the matter, and we carried it through.” 
The resolution was in the following words: 
“ Resolved, That as soon as the funds will justify it, this convention will establish 
in some central part of the State a classical and theological school which shall 
unite agricultural labor with study, and be opened only for those preparing for the 
ministry.” 
In the following year this last clause was altered and made to read, ‘‘admitting 
others besides students in divinity.” 
The lack of promptness in carrying out the resolution led Dr. Sherwood to begin 
an institution of his own, as will be seen from this extract: 
* A school was to have Bee opened in January of the ee ing year (1832), but 
      ce apbert Inu olpenig the nonvicee, adel, Calley carsedted a augpoced cxrus G6; Nees Dany ak ae 
that his Bible was not like Mr. Posy’s Bible, for his Bible, instead of being ‘brought up at the feet of 
Gamaliel,’ read ‘brought up at the foot of Gamel Hill,’ a hill so poor it would not sprout a pea, and 
thereby Paul was a poor man, unable to get an education and had to learn tent making to gain a liv- 
ing. * * * Another preacher, preaching from the parable of the pounds in Luke xix, claimed that 
an ‘austere man,’ in verse 21 proved John to be an ‘oyster man,’ who employed his time fishing for 
oysters. As Dr. Sherwood says, ‘If such ignorance was ever called to preach, it brings to mind the 
importanity of a good Methodist brother in Milledgeville by the namo of Pierson, who avowed that 
the Lord called to him almost every night, “Pierson, Pierson, go preach my Gospel.” But his 
prethren refused to license him because of his destitution of qu ations. He importuned, and they 
at last informed him that he mistook the name, and it was ee whom he heard the Lord call, 
alluding to Dr. Lovick Pierce.’” (Pp, 139-140.) .

  868 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
in the fall no farm had been purchased, and I discovered that the committee were 
afraid of putting the plan into practice. I therefore purchased 160 acres of land, 14 
miles northwest of Eatonton, from Thomas Cooper,! for $600, and advertised for 8 or 
10 pupils, on the manual-labor plan. This experiment succeeded so well that the 
committee of the convention began to look out for a locality, and the result was 
the purchase of a farm from Mr. James Redd in Greene County. The committee 
requested me to relinquish my school in the latter part of 1832, stating that they 
were about to establish one of the same kind, to which I readily assented, as my 
undertaking had cost me some $500 out of pocket.” 
This experience seemed sufficient to keep him from the desire to have further per- 
sonal communion with the enterprise, for in an autobiographical sketch he wrote 
thus: 
“Tn 1833 the manual-labor school of the Georgia Baptist Convention was begun on 
the spot now known as Penfield, a few miles from Greensboro, and which with the 
exception of one single log cabin was then in the woods. Mr. B. M. Sanders was 
chosen principal. Although requested by Jesse Mercer, James Armstrong, and 
Judge Stocks, I declined being a candidate for the office.” 
It is not easy to understand why an institution begun as this was did not come to 
a quicker end. To this double log cabin resorted 39 students at the opening of 1833. 
In the History of the Baptist Denomination is an extended account of the several 
matters leading to the establishment of Mercer Institute, so named from Jesse 
Mercer, the most eminent among the clergy in the State. The executive committee, 
who acted as an agent of the convention in affairs relating to the management, 
were expressly enjoined against making any debts. ‘‘No debts shall be contracted 
by the committee or trustees on the credit of the institution without funds in hand 
to pay, otherwise in every case it shall be on their own individual responsibility.” 
The following are some of the initial regulations: 
“The scholastic year shall be divided into two terms, first, of six months, from 
the second Monday in January to the second Monday in July, and the second, of five 
months, from the third Monday in July to the third Monday in December. The rates 
of tuition shall be $1.50 per month for all students in English grammar, geography, 
history, and common arithmetic; $2.50 per month for all in the learned languages, 
criticism, philosophy, mathematics, and other higher English branches of science. 
All over 16 years of age shall have board, room rent, and firewood for $4 a month, 
exclusive of their labor, and those under 16 shall pay $6 per month and have the 
value of their labor deducted as may be estimated by the steward and trustees; 
washing shall be furnished for $8 a year—all of which shall be required each term 
. inadvance. Each student shall furnish his own bedding and candles.” 
Despite the indisputable fact that this movement was begun with ideas not only 
humane but beneficent, one can not but be reminded here of the advertisement of 
Mr. Waxford Squeers of ‘his famous school at Dotheboys Hall, which goes thus: 
“Education: At Mr. Waxford Squeers’ Academy, Dotheboys Hall, at the delight- 
ful village of Dotheboys, near Greta Bridge, in Yorkshire, youth are boarded, 
clothed, booked, furnished with pocket money, providéd with all necessaries, 
instructed in all languages, living and dead, mathematics, orthography, geometry, 
astronomy, trigonometry, the use of the globes, algebra, single stick (if required), 
writing, arithmetic, fortification, and every other branch of classical literature. 
Terms, 20 guineas perannum. No extras, no vacations; adict unparalleled. * * * 
“N. B.—An able assistant wanted, Annual salary, 5 pounds. A master of arts

Of each one of the pupils to be sent there one, without great stretch of imagina- 
tion, might recall Dickens’ ‘‘Supposititious little boy who had been left with a

widowed mother who didn’t know what to do with him; the poor lady had thought, 
as a means of thawing the tardy compassion of his relatives in his behalf, of sending 
him to a Yorkshire school.” 
Rey. Billington M. Sanders undertook the management of this institution. In 
his farewell address, delivered at his retirement in December, 1839, are the following 
words: 
“The arrangements consisted of two double cabins with a garret to each for 
dwelling, for dining, and for study for both teachers and students. With these 
limited accommodations and with one assistant I opened the institution in January, 
1833, with 39 students, having 36 of them to board in my own family. Among these 
were 7 young men preparing for the ministry.” 
Yet, surprising as it seems now, the language immediately following indicates a 
success which was most encouraging to the hopes of its friends in the denomination. 
“T shall ever remember with lively emotions of pleasure the patience and cheer- 
fulness with which the students of this year sustained the privations and trials to 
which they were subjected by their cramped circumstances. They may be truly 
said to have borne hardships like good soldiers. While living as in a camp in their 
midst and burdened with the charge and responsibility of the literary, theological, 
laboring, and boarding departments, I found no little support in all my cares and 
labors from witnessing that while they lived upon the cheapest fare, had.no place 
for study but the common schoolroom, no place to retire to for rest but a garret 
without fire in the coldest weather, and labored diligently three hours a day, no 
complaint was heard, but that the most entire cheerfulness ran through all their 
words and actions. 
“Tn a word, those favorable indications of the success of the enterprise soon 
began to inspire its friends with confidence and to animate their efforts for the 
extension of its advantages. An amount was soon raised to erect another large 
school building with eight comfortable rooms for dormitories and a brick basement 
for chapel and schoolrooms. 
“The second year operations were commenced with increased accommodations, 
with an additional teacher, and 80 students, 70 of whom boarded in common.” 
Such extraordinary success in circumstances extremely limited and otherwise 
unpromising was due, perhaps, mainly to the character of the man chosen as leader. 
Billington Sanders, as was seen hereinbefore, was opposed to the scheme of Dr. 
Sherwood to connect manual labor with education. It was with reluctance, there- 
fore, that he consented to become the principal, with the understanding that he was 
to be relieved whenever a suitable person could be gotten to succeed him. It had 
appeared that the Baptists in general desired such an institution, and he bravely 
made the sacrifices inseparable from the chief responsibility of its conduct. Besides 
being one of the most popular clergymen in the denomination, he was possessed of 
considerable property, upon which he lived with the liberality common to well-to-do 
planters. He had the entire confidence of everybody in his capacity, integrity, 
energy, will, resolution, and courage. His face was much like that of Gen. Andrew 
Jackson, and he was his equal in intrepid pursuit of aims and performance of action 
believed to be just and proper. Fathers who were in the habit of receiving unqnues- 
tioning obedience from their children at home knew that they would be required to 
render it as entirely to this their chosen representative. Boys well understood that 
they must endure, perform, and obey, and that if they came back home without 
leave they would be at once returned, and, after punishment for such audacity, be 
put to work again. The simple, plain, hard fare on which they lived was believed 
to be of the sort best suited to teach habits of economy such as few, perhaps none, 
had learned at home, where their mothers, nobody objecting, were used to set before 
them three excellent square meals every day. Thoreau, a leader in the noted Brook 
Farm, demonstrated that a man could live on $14 a year, and we have seen how far 
20 guineas went at Dotheboys Hall. The experiment here was to put the education

of youth on as economical scale as possible and combine it with labor, for the pur- 
pose, among others, of hindering book learning from puffing up to the degree of 
bringing on repugnance to work. 
Fortunately this man had a wife who was perhaps as competent and loyal a 
helpmeet as ever stood by husband and children in exigent conditions, known by 
thousands of Baptists even down to this day as ‘‘Old Mistress.” The assiduous 
motherly care and tenderness with which she watched and tended the youth under 
her keeping had the blessing of Heaven and the ever-enduring, affectionate grati- 
tude of its recipients. Her husband whipped with the unction that was universal 
among his predecessors and contemporaries high and low in the profession. It was 
said of him that sometimes he wept sorely at the necessity of inflicting punishment, 
for he was a man abounding in charity as in unselfish devotion to all conceived 
duties. Yet this weakness, as proved by oft-repeated oxperience, meant everything 
but sparing to the culprit. Instead, it seemed to exasperate its condignness. This 
writer has often heard an old boy shout and make his hearers shout with laughter 
while telling of scenes in which this peculiarity was exhibited. ‘Truth is,” one of 
those used to say, ‘‘when a boy was called up to be whipped, he hoped that Old 
Master (as we called him) would not get to crying with his admonitions (sometimes 
as affectionate as possible in the beginning), knowing that if he did it would be so 
much the worse for his back. He’d begin very mildly, almost beseechingly, pointing 
out our errors and counseling for all sakes to quit them; but when he got warmed 
up his under lip began to drop and the tears to pour down his cheeks. Then he’d 
suddenly riso from his chair and cry out, ‘And the fact is, in the way you are going 
on you are to ruin yourself and bring down the gray hairs of your parents to the 
gra-y-ve!’ Then he’d light on the offender just as 2 man, holding by his hind leg, 
beats with a stick a sheep-killing hound. That was a time for a fellow to run away 
if there was anywhere except home to go. But afterwards the mistress came along 
with words and tendering of blessed soothing. Many and many a prank of mischief 
was forefended by her admonitions, and many another’s punishment healed by her 
precious balm.” 
As for insubordination, there was next to none, since for that sufficient audacity 
“was impossible in the face of the discipline without and within. But tricks, prac- 
tical jokes, and the like were as natural and as inevitable as physical growth in 
such uncommonly healthy daily exercises, amid living that, although of the plainest, 
was abundant and entirely sustaining. These were the more numerous and the 
bolder because of that wretched system of espionage then obtaining in almost all 
schools, especially boarding. Occasionally one of those young men who were pre- 
paring for the ministry, called ‘‘ beneficiaries,” conceived it his duty to be informant 
as well as divinity student, and such action as that is always attended with increase 
instead of diminution of wrongdoing. Orchards, chicken roosts, and fruit patches 
never dwelt in entire security, the less because the zest of enjoyment of their yield 
was enhanced by the risk in obtaining. Many a boy who never thought of such 
pranks when at home too easily fell into them when he found that a sycophant was 
sneaking after his footsteps. 
Perhaps it was hoped that the plan would pay expenses. If so, its friends were 
disappointed, yet above this was the notion that at least it would serve to promote 
health, economy, industry, and sense of the dignity of labor. In the matter of the 
first, it was eminently successful. On a farm of near 400 acres, with gentle undu- 
lations of hill and lowland in an extremely healthy region, at daily exercise which 
was not, and could not have been pushed beyond moderation, and which did not 
rise even to that degree, this work was much like that undergone in daily sports and 
athletics in boarding schools generally. As for the acquisition of skill, at least any 
considerable degree of it, few, if any, had indulged expectation. Truth is, such a 
thing was little among the parents of those boys. Of scientific agriculture there 
was next to none. The pioneers of that happy region, as was noted in a former 
paper in this series, cut and slashed that fecund soil which in spite of such reckless-

ness gave forth in abundance its first fruits. If profound interest could have been 
felt by these lads in such work, it would have effected little good, perhaps some 
harm by leading them when come to adult age to continue the havoc then in general 
practice by which not very many planters, although with abundant support for all, 
man and beast, made little above the natural accretions from increase in the number 
of their negroes. The thought that agriculture was a thing to be taught was in 
very few, if any men’s minds. Mr. Sanders was an excellent preacher and a good 
manager of money accounts, but as a planter he had much to learn himself. He 
preached, taught arithmetic, algebra, geography, grammar, theology, some Latin, a 
little Greek, and supervised the work of forty hands save one on the plantation. 
These students and these hands he lodged and fed just-as himself and his family were 
lodged and fed, and the little sickness that occurred, he and his wife doctored and 
tended, as if the patients had been their own dear children. Strictly adhering to 
the maxims of St. Paul adopted at the beginning to ‘“‘owe no man anything,” he did 
all that was possible to the energy and the high mindedness which he had perhaps 
more than any other man in the denomination, at least more than any other who 
was or could have been made available for the multifold responsibilities of the 
position. The school grew satisfactorily, new subscriptions of funds came in, other 
and really excellent buildings were erected, additional professors were called, and a 
steward with a salary was engaged to superintend the farm, and assume charge of 
the boarding department. 4 
This writer lately received a letter in answer to one of inquiry from a friend who 
had been a student at this school, and was graduated in the university, which it 
became afterwards. He is a gentleman of excellent attainments and for more than 
fifty years an eminent minister of the gospel. Some extracts are here given. 
«‘The labor system was started to give exercise and health to the boys. It was in 
the place of the baseball and other athletic exercises connected with most colleges 
now. * * * J don’t know exactly, but I do not think it ever did pay expenses. 
These were light, for we ate corn bread and slept on our own beds, * * * there 
was great rejoicing even in anticipation over Thursday night, which was biscuit 
night.!. We worked two hours each day except Saturday—two long hours. The 
pay was a mere pittance, about bought the goose quills we used. The work was on 
the farm. There was a sort of mechanical department. You remember > 
preacher, 30 years old, parrot-toed, a carpenter; he bossed it. Fora long time I 
worked at the whip saw. * * * We fared hard. ‘Old Mistress’ herself drank 
the stuff that old Pete*made, called coffee, and lived as hard as the rest of us. She 
practiced self denial, and perhaps did as much as anyone to build up Mercer. * * * 
All the leading denominations in Georgia, you remember, tried the system. The 
Baptists, believing in perseverance, were the last to quit.” 
Although some of this gentleman’s recollections were not ‘‘very pleasant,” yet the 
system, to his view, served reasonably its purposes. It was abandoned not very long 
after its riso into Mercer University, for, among other reasons, because so large a 
number of youth refused (with their parents’ consent) to go there, and instead 
resorted to the State University. 
This particular experiment, the most extensive and long continued on that line of 
educational endeavor in middle Georgia, has been selected by this writer, because of 
his better acquaintance with it, he having been during two of its last years a student   
1The old boys used to tell things about these bisenits which might not be wholly uninteresting to 
some of tho numerous students of financial topics nowadays. The wide-hearted Old Mistress, if she 
were not allowed to give to her charge this delightful Southern plate but once a week, was resolute in 
her determination that they should have a plenty, and she generously turned her eyes far, far away 
when the large surplusage above what they could consume went into their pockets. Now, in the 
absence of pocket money, these became an accredited medium of exchange in what merchandising 
wwas carried on among themselves. Tops, sets of marbles, buckskin-covered balls, half-spent pocket- 
knives, slices of watermelon that cost nothing to the seller, and other such luxuries were bought and 
sold by lads of 12 and 14 in this quasi fiat money, whose commercial value varied according to its 
nearness to foregone or coming Thursday nights. :

of the university. The most thoughtful, even among the students, foresaw that the 
system must come toanend. As theschool rose in numbers and, when raised to a col- 
lege, was supplied with a full corps of professors competent to impart not only higher 
learning but love of it, that sort of outdoor exercise grew to be regarded, both by 
students and teachers, as becoming constantly less and less adequate to realize the 
hopes of its founders, at least as they witnessed and partook of its practice. In 
time the founders themselves became so convinced those most intelligent among 
them deciding that union of study and work under those particular circumstances 
was impracticable; that education must concern itself with principles and causes 
before it came to things. Quotation is made here of a few brief paragraphs from a 
pamphlet, Psychology of Manual Training, by Hon. William T. Harris, Commissioner 
of Education. The first is: 
“Man goes back from the fact to the producing cause. But he goes back of its 
producing cause to a deeper cause that unites two or more series of producing 
causes; back of the oak and pine to tree in general; back of tree, and grass, and 
lichen to plant in general; back of plant and animal life to life in general. Man’s 
powers of thought rise from things to cause, and from cause to cause, leaving a 
smaller and smaller residuum of mere sense data, and yet getting nearer the under- 
lying reality which causes all these sense data * * 
«This is the great point for educators to observe. We do not get at the true real- 
ity by sense perception but by thought. * * * 
“School studies are for the most part given to a knowledge of human nature and 
human combination, rather than to a knowledge of material things. * * * If 
the child will learn how to read and write, he may learn the experience of the race 
through the countless ages of its existence. He may by scientific books and period- 
icals see the world throngh the sense of myriads of trained specialists devoting 
whole lives to the inventory of nature. What is immensely more than this, he may 
think with their brains, and assist his feeble powers of observation and reflection 
by the gigantic aggregate of the mental labor of the race. This is the great mean- 
ing of school education, to give to the pupil the use of the means for availing him- 
self of the mental products of the race. Compared with what he receives from the 
race, the productions of the most original of men are a mere speck in a wide field of 
view. Everyone may add something to the aggregate of the world’s knowledge, but 
he must, if he is educated and rises above the brute, receive infinitely more than he 
gives. Hence, in comparing the educative effect of learning to read with the edu- 
cative effect of learning the carpenter’s trade, we must cdhsider the difference of 
manne 3S 
Speaking of the school proper he says: ‘Its education is followed by its greatest 
educative effects afterwards through life. For the person is destined to use this 
knowledge of reading daily as a key by which to unlock the treasures of all human 
learning. The school has given him the possession of the means of permanent and 
continuous self-education. It is the difference between a piece of baked bread 
which nourishes for the day and the seed corn which is the possibility of countless 
harvests. Education that educates the child in the art of self-education is that 
which the aggregate experience of mankind has chosen for the school.” 
In this pamphlet, suggested by the intemperate zeal of some who have before 
their eyes scientific physical training so closely set that they can not see the greater 
things beyond it, are many other unanswerable arguments. 
The people of middle Georgia, few of whom at that period (sixty years ago) were 
liberally educated, were earnestly intent that their children should become so, yet 
were not entirely without apprehension that much learning might tend to seduce 
them from a just estimate of frugality, industry, economy, and the performance or 
the superintendence of manual work. He was very far from being an exception, that 
excellent and well-to-do old farmer who, when asked if he intended to send his 
boys to college, answered: “No, that I aint; seem to me the mainest things them 
 
-P-A-G-E-949
    EARLY EDUCATIONAL LIFE IN MIDDLE GEORGIA. 873: 
college boys learn, is to chaw and smoke seegars, talk dictionary words, git above 
work, and be imp’dent to old people.” To guard against dreaded results they made 
them take along and use things of home life—the hoe, the plow, and the trace chain; 
to mingle in their thoughts of Greek and Roman those of corn and cotton; to work, 
to feed, and to curry horses, mules, and oxen. The experiment was made by men of 
several denominations, sensible and to the last degree resolute. Their sons in con- 
tact with this double existence, after a year or two of half-hearted endeavorings, 
saw before their fathers the incongruity; necessarily they were economical, for 
their pocket moneys were extremely limited, and they knew better than to make 
debts in the stores, which were not long in appearing in the village that rapidly 
formed around them. As they advanced in knowledge under the excellent teachers 
provided for them, while they took on no disgust for manual work in itself, their 
performance of it was languid and less than indifferent. Circulars following home 
the best students with a disgracefully low figure in labor were excused for the sake 
of the exalted figures obtained in their studies. These many of them pursued with 
great diligence, and almost all to satisfaction. What punishments were received 
(and they came in frequent, relentless showers!) were mainly for other things than 
neglect of text-books. With these they made haste. What haste there was, when 
laying them aside they repaired to the field, was made while homeward bound; 
never when outward. If ever a laborer was unworthy of his hire, pitiful as was 
the wage, it was here. There was little or no complaining ever; during the last 
years there was none. Workers went forth loitering, yet cheerful, feeling no sort of 
dread of hurting themselves in the smallest particular by overwork. Often, but 
entirely leisurely, they looked at the descending sun, and sometimes when he seemed 
to be making no more haste than they were, deciding that his not being quite down 
was no reason why he ought not to be, they—but not too far—anticipated that inter- 
esting occasion and made for home. A good bath and a shifting of clothing made 
them more than ready for the good supper they knew to be preparing; for by this 
time a dozen or so of well-to-do planters had settled in the village, and for a sum 
which now would seem absurdly little gave board of the very best. 
The system itself, when the college was opened, foresaw its own decline; but, 
apparently in tenderness toward the older brethren, so many of whose hopes had 
been with it from the start, it lingered to its twelfth year, when, with resignation, 
approximating unanimity of students, faculty, trustees, and people, it went the way 
of all the earth. Its very last article was preceded by the following resolution, 
passed by the trustees in December, 1844: 
«‘Whereas the manual-labor department of Mercer University has been sustained 
at a heavy expense—an expense which the present state of our fund will not justify— 
and has, in our judgment, materially retarded the growth of our institution after as 
favorable experience as we have been able to make of the scheme; and 
“Whereas the contributors of the university fund, so far as they have been called 
upon, expressed themselves with almost entire unanimity, ready to concur in any 
measure in reference to the system which the board of trustees may deem essential 
to the prosperity of the institution; and 
‘Whereas the board of trustees have found themselves under all circumstances 
unable to accomplish to any desired extent the important and benevolent designs for 
which it was originally organized: Be it therefore 
“« Resolved, That this department be, and is hereby, indefinitely suspended.” 
Thus the Baptists, latest of all, noted for their perseverance, had to admit at last 
that even to this favorite virtue were limitations. 
    
1 From these, however, college students and those in preparatory classes who were over 16 years old 
were exempt.

IV.—THE UNIVERSITY. 
The situation of the State of Georgia at the several periods during the war of 
Independence was peculiarly exigent. Youngest and most remote of all the prov- 
inces, sparsely occupied by whites, exposed along a border of several hundred miles 
toIndian maraudings, its hardships, real and apprehended, were among the most try- 
ing. Discouraged by these hardships, a considerable number defected from the cause 
of liberty, and between these, known as Tories, and the rest many tragic scenes 
occurred. During the latter part of the year 1776 affairs became so embarrassing 
that the leaders of public opinion in South Carolina conceived the idea of annexa- 
tion, and in the general assembly of that State the following resolution was intro- 
duced and passed unanimously: 
“That a union between the two States of South Carolina and Georgia would tend 
effectually to promote their strength, wealth, and dignity, and to secure their lib- 
erty, independence, and safety.” 
Commissioners were sent to Georgia, but the proposal met with no favor. One of 
these, William Henry Drayton, after its rejection, became so persistent in private 
efforts toward the end for which he had been sent that Governor Treutlen, acting 
on the advice of the executive council, published offer of rewards for the apprehension 
of him and hisassociates. Yetin the convention called by Archibald Bulloch, governor 
and president of the council of safety, the first constitution was adopted, February 
5, 1777, one of the articles of which required the erection of a school at the public 
expense in each county. From this period the State was constantly harassed by dis- 
asters and dangers. Savannah was taken, the government transferred to Augusta, 
and at one time such was the exigency of conditions that the governor, John Hous- 
toun, was invested with dictatorial powers. Relief came not until the evacuation 
of the province by Sir James Wright, the royal governor, June 14, 1782. Yet it was 
not.until the close of the war that measures could be taken in the cause of educa- 
tion, and these were recommended by Governor Lyman Hall during the three months’ 
session of the general assembly in the summer of 1783. In his opening message were 
the following: 
“¥rom a view of the profligate and wicked lives of many in the community, it 
appears that some laws to restrain vice and encourage virtue aro of the highest 
importance to the welfare of the State, it being certain that almost all the evils of 
government originate from men of corrupt principles and abandoned manners. In 
addition, therefore, to wholesome laws restraining vice, every encouragement ought 
to be given to introduce religion, and learned clergy to perform divine worship in 
honor to God, and to cultivate principles of religion and virtue among our citizens. 
For this purpose it will be your wisdom to lay an early foundation for endowing 
seminaries of learning; nor can you, I conceive, lay a better than by a grant of a 
sufficient tract of land that may, as in other governments, hereafter, by lease or 
otherwise, raise a revenue sufficient to support such valuable institutions.”! 
There is something pathetic in the patriotic and wise endeavors of a small number 
of men, one of whom was the full equal of any in his generation, to found a uni- 
versity in the State, and their failure because of the early death of the chief among 
their great leaders. Lyman Hall, born in Connecticut, removed to Georgia in 1752, 
and became one of the bravest and most influential patriots. He wasasigner of the 
Declaration of Independence, a Representative in Congress, was made governor of 
Georgia, and while thus acting, supported and guided mainly by another from the 
same State, originated those endeavors. 
In Stevens’s History of Georgia (p. 353) occurs the following: 
“In the midst, however, of the troubles incident to the unsettled state of a fron- 
tier province in that transition period, when military law had ceased and civil law 
was but imperfectly established, the legislature, with a forecast which reflects the

-P-A-G-E-951
    EARLY EDUCATIONAL LIFE IN MIDDLE GEORGIA. 875 
highest character upon their wisdom, took measures for the establishment. of a State 
institution of learning. On tho 25th of February, 1784, a committee of the legisla- 
ture was sent to the executive council bearing a resolution requesting his honor the 
governor to grant land warrants for 5,000 acres each in the name of John Houstoun, 
James Habersham, William Few, Joseph Clay, Abram Baldwin, William Houstoun, 
and Nathan Brownson, esqrs., or their successors in office, in trust for the college that 
is to be established in this State, that one or more of tho said trustees be requested 
to proceed immediately, with a surveyor or surveyors, and superintend the survey- 
ing of the said land in cach county agreeable to the act for that purpose made,” ete. 
In the next section the land thus provided was to be exempted from taxation. 
The act to which reference was made by appointment of the committee was an act 
for laying out the two counties of Franklin and Washington, the eleventh section of 
which is given as follows: 
“And whereas the encouragement of religion and learning is an object of great 
importance to any community and must tend to the prosperity, happiness, and advan- 
tage of the same: Z 
“Beit enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the county surveyors, immediately after 
the passing of this act, shall proceed to lay out in each county 20,000 acres of land of 
the first quality, in separate tracts of 5,000 acres each, for the endowment of a col- 
lege or seminary of learning, and which said lands shall be vested in and granted to 
his honor the governor for the time being.” ! 
Thence followed appointment of the trustees hereinbefore named, who were 
“empowered to do all such things as to them shall appear requisite and necessary, 
o forward the establishment and progress of the same; and all vacancies shall be 
filled up by the said trustees. And the said county surveyors shall in six months 
after the passing of this act make returns to the trustees, hereinbefore mentioned, 
of all regular plats of all such tracts as they shall have laid out and surveyed by 
virtue of this act.” 
On the 27th of January, 1785, an act in pursuance of the plans thus started was 
passed, being entitled ‘“‘An act for the more full and complete establishment of a 
public seat of learning in this State.” The preamble to this act is so excellent of 
its kind that it is given in full herein: 
“As it is the distinguishing happiness of free governments that civil order should 
be the result of choice, and not necessity, and the common wishes of the people 
become the laws of the land, their public prosperity, and even existence, very much 
depends upon suitably forming the minds and morals of their citizens. When the 
minds of the people in general are viciously disposed and unprincipled, and their 
conduct disorderly, a free government will be attended with greater confusions and 
evils more horrid than the wild, uncultivated state of nature. It can only be happy 
where the public principles and opinions are properly directed and their manners 
regulated. This is an influence beyond the reach of laws and punishments and can 
be claimed only by religion and education. It should therefore be among the first 
objects of those who wish well to the national prosperity to encourage and support 
the principles of religion and morality and early to place the youth under the form- 
ing hand of society that, by instruction, they may be molded to the love of virtue 
and good order. Sending them abroad to other countries for their education will 
not answer these purposes; it is too humiliating an acknowledgment of the igno- 
rance or infirmity of our own, and will always be the cause of so great foreign 
attachments that upon principles of policy it is inadmissible. 
“This country, in the times of our danger and distress, found security in the 
principle and abilities which wise regulations had before established in the minds 
of our countrymen, that our present happiness, joined to the pleasing -prospects, 
should conspire to make us feel ourselves under the strongest obligations to form

the youth, the rising hope of our land, to render the like glorious and essential 
services to our country.” ! 
A noble beginning for higher education was made in this session of the general 
assembly, led by one whose name and memory from the people of Georgia merit more 
gratitude than those of any other in its history; one who but for having been over- 
taken of death in his prime would have placed education upon a level with that in 
the State of which he was native, with whose polity he had become thoroughly 
acquainted, and had eager desire to extend it. Abram Baldwin, born in Guilford, 
Conn., in the year 1754, was graduated at Yale College in 1772, and for four 
from 1775 to 1778—was a tutor there. Having studied divinity with view to become 
a clergyman, he was invited, in the year 1781, to become professor of divinity and 
college pastor, but declined the offer and served as chaplain in one of the regiments 
of his native State. Here he made acquaintance with Gen. Nathanael Greene. At 
the close of the war Gen. Greene removed to Georgia, and persuaded Baldwin to do 
the same, which he did in the year 1784. Withdrawing from the ministry, he began 
studying for the bar, was admitted to practice, and rapidly rose into a large business. 
Within a few months after his admission, having already a commanding figure among 
leaders of public opinion, he was elected to the legislature at the session next ensu- 
ing after his arrival and in the same year. Seldom, if ever, had a man, coming into 
a strange community far remote from his native, with antecedents so little known, 
risen with such rapidity. From the very first his presence and demeanor, his walk 
and conversation impressed all minds with the notion that he was one born to be a 
leader of men. This he easily became in the first public body to which he was so 
speedily sent. 
Baldwin was a lawgiver. It so appeared in the general assembly of January, 
1785, less than a year after his coming into the State, unknown of all except the dis- 
tinguished soldier at whose instance he had come, and who died in the following 
year. It is not apposite to the subject of this article to allude otherwise than briefly 
to the work done by him for purposes besides educational. Preeminently gifted as 
he was, the impress of his hands must necessarily be upon whatever enterprise came 
within the compass of the plane wherever he traveled and wrought. It seems a 
pity, not only for his adopted State but for the whole country, that little memorial 
was left of such a man beyond the records of his public actions and the traditions of 
his acknowledged greatness. In the exigencies of a new, inchoate society, with a 
vast, unpeopled territory, extending far westward, it was remarkable how quickly 
all thoughtful, patriotic minds put themselves under the lead of this young stranger 
of 30 years. Almost universal tradition assigned to him well-nigh sole author- 
ship of the judiciary system of the State, which great lawyers in this country and 
which such as Lord Tenterden and Lord Brougham declared to be a marvel of its 
kind. Such a man seemed to be more needed in the councils of the young confed- 
erate government than in those of his own State, and so, two years afterwards he 
was sent to the Federal convention, and played a conspicuous part in the formation 
of the Federal Constitution. No member of the convention more thoughtfully 
revolved the subjects of investigation. In the notes taken down by Madison the 
speeches and general movements made by him exhibit great carefulness and conser- 
vation, yet boldness wherever it seemed to him needed to be put forth. He was a 
leader among those who foresaw and dreaded the policy of intrusting to the General 
Government any greater powers beyond what were essential to the discharge of 
federative functions. One noted sentence of his has been often referred to: “ Polit- 
ical power is like the screw in mathematics; it holds all it has, and every turn gives 
it more.” With the instinct of genins he recognized at a glance, as it were, the 
peculiar needs of the society into which he had come to dwell, and in what time 
was left for the purpose he Jabored to supply them. It was well known, and it 
became a matter of frequent speech, that in all the public assemblies in which he

had parts to enact, in those framing the constitution of Georgia, in the general 
assembly of the State, in Congess as Member of the House, to which he was elected 
in 1790, and in the Senate, he was never absent from his post for a single day until 
his last sickness, just one week before his death, in Washington, in 1807, at the age 
of 52 years. 
The principal item of the loss to the civil government of the State by the transfer 
of Baldwin to Congress and particularly by his early death was a long postpone- 
ment of the establishment of the supreme court of appeals for the correction of errors 
of superior court judges. Foresight of the indispensable need of such a tribunal 
provided for its early foundation; but the withdrawal of the great leader delayed — 
it for half a century. If he had lived, what took place in 1845 would have done so 
long, long before, and been put upon a far more satisfactory foundation. It is 
remarkable that many of the very greatest lawyers in the State opposed it to the 
last, an example of the willingness of prominent citizens to be content with systems 
wherein they have obtained positions of controlling influence. 
Yet the most serious loss inflicted upon the State by the absence of Baldwin was 
felt by its educational interests. It was his aim that general superintendence of 
education should be assumed by the State under the leading influence of one great 
university. He was one of those wise men who maintain that education within any 
State properly begins at the summit instead of the bottom. The decision of the 
multitudes, after he passed away, like that of multitudes everywhere when not ade- 
quately guided, that it should begin at the bottom and ascend delayed for ahundred 
years, and it yet delays, the accomplishment of that aim of a man who was the full 
equal of Thomas Jefferson in lawgiving wisdom, and possibly his superior in culti- 
vation. 
On January 25, 1785, an act was passed by the general assembly, some sections of 
which are as follows: t 
“Whereas for the great purposes of internal education, divers allotments of land 
have at different times been made, particularly by the legislature at their sessions 
in July, 1783, and February, 1784, all of which may be comprehended and made the 
basis of one general and complete establishment; therefore, enacted, 
“Src. I, That the general superintendence and regulation of the literature of the 
State, and in particular of the public seat of learning, shall be committed and 
intrusted to one board, denominated ‘the board of visitors,’ hereby vested with all 
powers of visitation, to see that the intent of this institution is carried into effect; 
and [18 persons named] who shall compose another board, denominated ‘the board 
of trustees.’ These two boards united, or a majority of each of them, shall compose 
the ‘Senatus Academicus of the University of Georgia.’ 
“Src. II. All statutes, laws, and ordinances for the government of the reverses 
shall be made and enacted by the two boards united, or a majority of each of them, 
subject always to be laid before the general assembly as often as required, and to be 
repealed or disallowed as the general assembly shall think proper.”! 
(As before seen, 40,000 acres of land had been set apart in lots of 5,000 acres each, 
for the university in the new counties of Washington and Franklin.) 
“Suc. IV. As the appointment of a person to be the president and head of the 
university is one of the first and most important concerns on which its respect and 
usefulness greatly depend, the board of trustees shall first examine and nominate; 
but the appointment of the president shall be by the two boards jointly, who shall 
also have the power of removing him from office for misdemeanors, unfaithfulness, 
or incapacity.” 
Several sections follow containing details regarding management, then comes 
“Sc. XIII. The Senatus Academicus at their stated annual meetings shall consult 
and advise, not only upon the affairs of the university, but also to remedy the 
defects, and advance the interests of literature through the State in general. For

this purpose it shall be the business of the members, previous to their meeting, to 
obtain an acquaintance with the state and regulations of the schools and places of 
education in their respective counties, that they may thus be possessed of the whole, 
and haye it before them for their mutual assistance and deliberation. Upon this 
information they shall recommend what kind of schools and academies shall be 
instituted, agreeably to the constitution, in the several parts of the State, and pre- 
scribe what branches of education shall be taught and inculcated in each. They 
shall also examine and recommend the instructors to be employed in them, or appoint 
persons for that purpose. The president of the university, as often as the duties of 
his station shall permit, and some of the members, at least once in a year, shall visit 
them and examine into their order and performances. 
“Src. XIV. All public schools, instituted or to be supported by funds or public 
moneys in this State, shall be considered as parts or members of the university, and 
shall be under the foregoing directions and regulations. 
“Src. XV. Whatsoever public measures are necessary to be adopted for accom- 
plishing these great and important designs, the trustees shall, from time to time 
represent and lay before the general assembly.” 
Such is an outline of the plan projected by this young man for education in the 
State. It was to begin where in every new State it should begin, with a great uni- 
versity, a primum mobile, destined to organize and preside over and regulate all 
inferior institutions receiving in time those who had passed through their courses to 
itself in order to qualify them for the coming duties of manhood and citizenship. 
A fair site was selected: on the Oconee River, around which the town of Athens grew 
up, and another native of Connecticut, Josiah Meigs, was elected president. 
In the same year, 1790, when Baldwin was elected to Congress, died his chief col- 
laborator, Lyman Hall. He was one of the Georgia signers of the Declaration of 
Independence, governor of the State, and before the advent of Baldwin the most 
cultured among its political leaders. He died childless at the age of 66 years.! His 
death was a sore loss to the State, and was felt to beso. But he died in cheerful 
hope that the provisions thus made for its welfare would accomplish the ends for 
which they had been devised. Such was also the hope of his young survivor, when 
he left for the more extended field where the people desired his talents to bo 
employed. Yet as president of the board of visitors he continued to be the main 
director in putting the institution on a foundation. With nothing but land to 
appropriate for this purpose, although land was in abundance for the support of a 
hundred fold greater population, and therefore had merely nominal market value, 
yet the beginning was made in 1801 under President Meigs, who in time was assisted 
by Prof. Addin Lewis, who had come from Connecticut at the same time with the 
president. These two with a tutor in French for some years constituted the faculty. 
Moneys accruing from rent of the university lands being wholly inadequate, the gen- 
eral assembly the following year passed an act for the loan of $5,000 ‘‘in aid of the 
funds of the said institution for erecting the college buildings,” conditioned to be 
repaid with interest. In 1803 a further act was passed, authorizing the trustees to 
“sell and dispose of, in such manner as they may deem most for the benefit of the 
institution, the tract of land belonging to the university in the county of Hancock, 
and to appropriate the moneys arising from the sale in such manner as in their 
judgment will most advance the beneficial purposes of the said university, and that 
they also have full power and authority to sell and dispose of in like manner, and 
for the same purposes, all such lots and land situate in and adjoining the site of the 
university as they think proper, reserving, nevertheless, the quantity of 37 acres 
1 The inscription upon his tomb, written by his widow, concludes with these touching words: 
“To him so mourn'd in death, so loved in life, 
The childless parent and the widowed wife, 
With tears inscribed this monumental stone, 
That holds his ashes and expects her own.””

of land for the college yard.”! This last tract bought and presented to the State by 
John Milledge consisted of over 600 acres, but the amount of sales was small, the 
village, so far from the center of existing population, being necessarily slow in set- 
tlement. Thus the institution struggled during infancy. In the year 1807 he who 
had been its founder and mainly its soul, died. He alone among its supporters fully 
comprehended what a great university is, what it means, what-is its full scope, and 
what it needs and can not do without for thé compass of its ends. The history of 
this institution henceforth is one of continuously recurring disappointments. The 
following extract, taken from a pamphlet written by the late Dr. Henry Hull, one of 
its first graduates and afterwards for several years one of the faculty, well sums up 
the accidents of twenty-five years whose likes were continued until 1884, when the 
pamphlet was written. It has for its title, Sketches from the Early History of 
Athens, Georgia, 1801-1825. 
“For a quarter of a century, at least, the interests of Athens and of the univer- 
sity went hand in hand—they rose and fell together; indeed, one was nothing with- 
out the other. The income of the university was derived from the rents of land 
deeded it by the State, and as land was very cheap none but the poorest as a rule 
rented it; consequently, the income was small and veryuncertain. From its organi- 
zation, in 1801, to 1811, the faculty consisted of a president, Mr. Meigs; one pro- 
fessor of French, M. Petit de Clairville, and one tutor, Addin Lewis, whose place 
in 1808 was filled by James Merriwether for a year, after which M. Petit held on 
for two years and resigned in 1810, leaving President Meigs alone in his glory to 
instruct all the classes in every department of science. So the college came very 
near to the gates of death, and the town had but little more vitality. In 1811 the 
faculty reorganized by the election of Dr. John Brown, president, and Dr. Henry 
Jackson and Mr. John R. Golding, professors. This galvanized the college into 
spasmodic breathing, and the town sympathized in the shock. A few ne before 
vacant, were occupied, and some whitewashing and maybe alittle painting done, and 
the place looked for brighter days. I don’t remember that anyone was so sanguine - 
as to build a new house or improve a yacant lot; but the hoped-for improvement did 
not come, and the college and town languished, notwithstanding the election, 
in 1813, of an educational professor, Dr. William Green. But this strengthening of 
the faculty did not have the expected effect of strengthening the institution. The 
rents did not come in, and the professors’ salaries, ridiculously small though they 
were, were not paid; no apparatus could be bought, no library was within reach, 
So the college languished and the town sickened, and if the legislature had not: 
authorized the board of trustees to sell the lands and invest the proceeds, both 
would soon have died together. But that important measure was adopted, and in 
1816 the lands were sold and notes and bonds taken in payment. The State took 
them to the amount of $120,000, and transferred to the university 1,000 shares of the 
stock of the Bank of the State of Georgia, guaranteeing 8 per cent dividend annually, 
and this it has paid, and only this, to the present day.” 
Thereis humor, yet some pathos, in the succeeding paragraph, in which Dr. Hull 
gave account of the disposal of the last, perhaps most valuable, tract owned by the 
university. 
“The line between Georgia and South Carolina was the northern bank of the 
Savannah River at high water, from its mouth to its intersection with the thirty- 
fifth parallel of north latitude, and where it forked the larger of the two should be 
considered a continuation of the Savannah. Now, the Tugaloo and Seneca formed 
the first fork from its mouth, and it became a question which was the larger. It was 
generally conceded that the Seneca was the principal stream, and was therefore con- _ 
sidered the boundary between the States. The lands between the rivers belonged 
then to Georgia, a part of which, 5,000 acres, lying near the junction and very valu- 
able, was deeded by the State, with other tracts, to the university. This district

was represented in the Georgia legislature by a Mr. Lane. Subsequent surveys, pre- 
tending to be more carefully made, determined that the Tugaloo was the larger river, 
and it became the boundary line, thereby losing to the University of Georgia her 
5,000 valuable acres. But our board of trustees resolved to make an effort to retain 
it. Supposing that such a tract, away in the backwoods, remote from any settle- 
ment, where public lands were worth but little more than the cost of surveying 
them, could be of small consideration to a State, they appointed one of their own 
body, a lawyer of distinction, to wait on the legislature of South Carolina, then in 
session, and ask the grant of the land should be confirmed to the university, not 
doubting that so small a favor would be granted. Colonel C, was a man of exquisite 
taste in wines and brandies, or at least he thought so, and kept that gift in active 
exercise on all proper occasions, and sometimes when the occasion was not proper. 
The South Carolinians knew exactly how to entertain such a man with becoming 
hospitality. There were some members of the legislature who, learning the object 
of the colonel’s visit and desiring to own themselves the land in question, deter- 
mined to prevent the confirmation of the grant, and succeeded in keeping our dele- 
gate in such a blissful state of tasting and tasting certain old and costly liquors that 
he did not have an opportunity to present the claims of the university until the legis- 
lature adjourned. Before its next meeting the lands were sold.” 
Yet for many years considerable interest in the university continued to be felt, and 
if thoroughly competent leadership had existed, it might have been put in time upon 
firm satisfactory foundation. A resolution of remarkable thoughtfulness and ability 
was adopted by the legislature in December, 1831. A brief extract is as follows: 
_ In our country every man ought to prepare himself for taking part in her public 
business. Should he never aspire to a seat in her State or national councils, he yet 
owes it as a duty to himself and his posterity, to let any talent he may possess 
appear at best in her primary assemblies. 
“Tf this view of our duty be correct, and it is believed it cannot be controverted, 
the committee feel warranted in considering the subject of education, the noblest 
and most important that can engage the attention of the lawgiver; it lies, in truth, 
at the basis of the whole social system. It affects not only the indjvidual happiness, 
the character and the usefulness of those who are its objects, but it exerts a most 
powerful and irresistible influence upon the government, the laws, and the liberties 
of communities. No nation where the majority of the people are well educated 
can be enslaved; no nation where the great mass is ignorant can retain its freedom. 
In proportion to the general intelligence will be the force, the wealth, and the 
influence of a State, and it will be respected in the exact ratio of the instructed 
talent it can bring into its negotiations.” ! 
Such utterances as this indicated the earnest interest felt by instructed minds for 
the bettering of an institution begun with purposes so patriotic and benign. Yet 
at that same session of the general assembly, Edward J. Black, representative from 
Richmond County, and afterwards member of Congress, one of the most distinguished 
politicians of the State, in a speech of notable eloquence, attacked the university, 
particularly regarding the manner in which it was conducted, and introduced a 
resolution for the appointment of a committee “to prepare and report a bill to 
remove the site of Franklin College” (the name by which the university was gen- 
erally called) “from Athens to Milledgeville, and to appropriate money for the 
erection of suitable buildings for that purpose, and to appoint fit and proper persons 
for designating the spot upon which said buildings shall be erected, and for super- 
intending the erection of the same.”? 
The journal from which this was taken does not contain any report of the com- 
mittee. The majority earnestly opposed it and doubtless it was deemed prudent to

let it sleep. This action of Mr. Black was a startling indication of prejudices 
against the university which for certain reasons had been rising for some time past, 
particularly in the middle and upper portions of the State which were to become 
strong enough to hinder for good further public intervention in its behalf. A com- 
mittee was appointed by the general assembly of 1833 to examine into the account 
of receipts and disbursements of the university from the 1st of November, 1831, to 
-the ist of November, 1833. Some suspicion had been cast upon the management of 
the funds and complaints made that it was needlessly backward in repaying the 
comparatively small advances that had been made to it when in particularly exigent 
circumstances. Investigation showed that the account had been kept with entire 
fairness and accuracy, and the committee so found. Yet they felt themselves called 
upon to append a significant insinuation after premising assertion of what they 
styled “the generous patronage of the State.” They reported: 
“The committee to whom was referred an account of the receipts and disburse- 
ments of the University of Georgia, from the 1st of November, 1831, to the 1st of 
November, 1833, inclusive, have had the same under consideration, and beg leave to 
report that on a careful perusal of said report they find the respective debts and 
credits in said account appear fair and explicit, and furnish a distinct detail of the 
fiscal concerns of that institution. This seminary of learning has long enjoyed the 
generous patronage of the legislature of this State and has evidently, within a 
short period, made rapid advances in public estimation. 
“It is an institution that requires ample supplies, because the disbursements 
necessary to keep it in successful operation are great; but so long as the funds pro- 
vided are both judiciously and economically applied it will receive the approbation 
of the people of Georgia.” 7 
Then follows an admonition which plainly evinced the hostility that for several 
years had been growing into virulence that foreboded unhappy consequences. It is 
put in these words: 
“But, to insure the future countenance of the State, the strongest evidence should 
be given, by those employed in carrying it forward, that the interest of the whole 
people, and not of a part, is strictly attended to. The pursuit of literature alone 
ean secure the confidence of the public, and both teacher and student will find it to 
be to their interest to devote their attention exclusively to this great object. Let 
it be run by action, not profession, that a generous emulation prevails among all 
those directly or indirectly connected with the university, to raise its character to a 
pitch of elevation that may make it an ornament and honor to the State. This is 
the only remuneration that she requires, and in fact imperiously demands. 
“Your committee deem these cursory remarks necessary to satisfy public expecta- 
tion, and admonitory to the university of the true course it ought to pursue.”! 
The university had been started when the settlements of middle Georgia were 
sparse and were struggling with many hardships to gain a substantial foothold. If 
not satisfied with the old field schools they were not in condition to obtain higher. 
In the first years after the opening, therefore, comparatively few from this region 
were sent to it. A majority of students came from Savannah and the counties near 
by, which were older, more prosperous, and far more advanced in culture. For sey- 
eral years all the country west of the Oconee River and south of Clark wherein 
the University was located continued to be Indian territory. Complaints began to 
be made that the low country students were more favored than the others. It was 
remarked that the long vacation instead of being set in the summer was in the 
winter. The cause of this, as was charged by middle Georgia people, was that such 
arrangement was suited to the peculiar habits of the low countrymen of property 
who used to spend the greater part of the summer at Madison Springs, a watering 
place near by the seat of the university, or in the villages among the mountains not 
far beyond. These it suited to haye yacation mainly in winter, when families 
would be at home.

Another cause of complaint was that the university soon fell under the control of 
one political party. It seemed an oversight in the act organizing the institution in 
making the board of trustees a close corporation, vacancies in which were to be filled 
by the remaining members, a provision which, it was argued, enabled the majority 
party to exercise and perpetuate domination. The late Mr. Justice John A. Camp- 
bell was often heard to say that during his attendance at the university the college 
was dominated by the party that was opposed to that of which his father, Duncan 
G. Campbell, was a prominent leader. Indeed it is an interesting fact that during 
many years Athens was the place and commencement the occasion of the meeting 
of both political parties for consultation and caucus nomination of candidates for 
governor and other high State and Federal officials. Old citizens yet point to the 
places where stood the two taverns at which the leaders severally sojourned during 
commencement week. 
Both these complaints, whether just or not, were greatly injurious. Belief or 
suspicion that the tone of the community was in favor of those whom middle 
Georgia people assumed to be, or at least to feel, aristocratic because of their wealth 
and better culture, served not only to diminish interest in the university, but to 
originate a jealousy between the two sections which it took several decades of years 
to subdue. Then such belief or suspicion regarding political partisanism necessarily 
wrought harm in all sections. 
But that which served to block effectually such support from the State as would 
secure the ends which the founders intended for the university was the denomi- 
national spirit of the two prevailing bodies of Christians—the Baptists and the 
Methodists—who far outnumbered all the rest in the rural districts of the State. 
To the faculty of the institution these denominations during the forming years 
made almost no contributions. This was owing to the fact that they at first had 
almost none to present who were qualified to be professors. Hardly a single one 
among their clergy had received a college education. Some of the most eloquent 
and otherwise great preachers, whose superiors in some important respects the State 
has never since produced, had gotten what education they possessed in elementary 
schools and in intervals of work on their plantations and other places of business, 
and were entirely uninustructed in classical and scientific studies. On the other 
hand, the Presbyterians, few in numbers outside of cities, had only an educated 
clergy, and proportionately a far greater number of educated persons among the 
laity. Some of the latter had been engaged in teaching, particularly in towns, while 
few, if any, in the two other denominations had ever pursued that vocation. From 
the old fields to academies of high grade the leap was, as it were, instantaneous, as 
as has been seen, and these were kept by teachers from New England. Yet it was 
not sc much because professorships were filled by Presbyterians as because of the 
rivalry between themselves that sentiment rose and rapidly took shape with each of 
the others to have its own university that tended to withdraw their support from 
the State institution. Unfortunately most persons, haying little knowledge of the 
chief ends of a great university, believed honestly that the one already established 
was as high as there was any need for, Their aim, therefore, was to leave Savannah, 
the Presbyterians, and the politicians to run it on their own lines, while they would 
start each its own, intended to foster, besides literature and science, denominational 
religious faith and to aspire to denominational supremacy. A few thoughtful per- 
sons in each denomination opposed movements foreseen to be fatal to highest univer- 
sity education; but their counsels were rejected, and Mercer University and Emory 
College almost simultaneously rose into being, their founders and supporters being 
at least four-fifths of the State. About the same time the Presbyterians, with like 
denominational intent, started their own separate institution, Oglethorpe Univer- 
sity, at the village of Midway. This last, however, in a few years, for lack of ade- 
quate support from a community comparatively few in numbers, was suspended. 
The two others, supported liberally from the beginning by their denominations, rose 
speedily into successful rivalry with the State University, averaging during fifty 
   
-P-A-G-E-959
    EARLY EDUCATIONAL LIFE IN MIDDLE GEORGIA. 883 
years at least as many pupils and imparting about as good college education. Cur- 
ricula of studies have been substantially the same in all, and alumni from all have 
risen to highest professional positions and made distinguished careers. Eminent 
specialists in any branch haye not been sent forth because of lack of the means of 
specialization possessed by such as Harvard, Yale, and Johns Hopkins. If these six 
hundred and upward of youth had been at the university instead of divided among 
three colleges, and the sentiment of all parties had been in its support, it would 
have been before now equal to any in the country, Tho existence of continued 
rivalry and the apparent need of continual struggle in each to be equal if not fore- 
most, tended to lower the standard of scholarship in bestowal of degrees. Bachelors 
of arts and masters of arts by hundreds have been so dubbed with insufficient consid- 
eration of what are imported by those high distinctions. Whoever aimed at special 
education in any department went out of the State to obtain it; and they do so yet. 
Looking back to Abram Baldwin and those who acted under his leadership, one 
is continually reminded of the misfortune of his death, to be succeeded by none in 
influence and authority to perpetuate and extend his ideas. Like Lycurgus, he esti- 
mated that highest education among other things was necessary to the founding 
of a new State. From Crete, Lycurgus brought Thales to Lacedemon, whom, pro- 
fessing to be only a lyric poet, he saw to be a wise lawgiver besides. ‘The very 
songs which he composed,” said Plutarch, ‘‘ were exhortations to obedience and con- 
cord, and the very measure and cadence of the verse, conveying impressions of order 
and tranquillity, had so great influence on the minds of the listeners that they were 
insensibly softened and civilized, insomuch that they renounced their feuds and ani- 
mosities and were united in a common admiration of virtue. So that it may be said 
that Thales prepared the way for the discipline introduced by Lycurgus.” Further 
on are these words touching Homer’s poem: ‘‘Here” (in Crete) “he had the first sight 
of Homer’s works in the hands, we may suppose, of the posterity of Creophylos;! 
and, having observed that the few loose expressions and actions of ill example which 
are to be found in his poems were much outweighed by serious lessons of State and 
rules of morality, he set himself eagerly to transcribe and digest them into order, as 
thinking they would be of good use in his own country. They had, indeed, obtained ~ 
some slight repute amongst the Greeks, and scattered portions, as chance conveyed. 
them, were in the hands of individuals; but Lycurgus first made them really 
known.” 3 
Baldwin, brought up at time-honored Yale, and devoting four other years to par- 
ticipation in its discipline, sought and hoped to found its like in the young State of 
his adoption. A foundation was laid broad, benign, and wise. The following four 
sections in the act of 1785 show how wide was the scope of his intentions: 
“Src. IX. All officers appointed to the instruction and government of the univer- 
sity shall be of the Christian religion, and within three months after they enter upon 
the execution of their trust snall publicly take the oath of allogiance and fidelity 
and the oaths of office prescribed in the statutes of the university—the president, 
before the governor or president of the council, and all other officers before the presi- 
dent of the university. 
“Src, X. The president, professors, tutors, students, and all officers and servants 
of the university, whose office requires their constant attendance, shall be, and they 
are hereby, excused from military duty, and from all such like duties and services; 
and all lands and other property of the university is hereby exempted from taxation. 
“Src. XI. The trustees shall not exclude any person of any religious denomination 
whatever from free and equal liberty and advantages of education, or from any of the 
liberties, privileges, and immunities of the university in his edueation, on account 
of his, her, or their speculative sentiments in religion, or being of a different religious 
profession.”?

“Sxc. XIV. All public schools, instituted or to be supported by funds or public 
moneys in this State, shall be considered as parts or members of the university, and 
shall be under the foregoing directions and regulations. 
“Sec. XV. Whatsoever public measures are necessary to be adopted for accomplish- 
ing these great and important designs the trustees shall from time to time repre- 
sent and lay before the general assembly.” 
Baldwin’s aim, as in the judiciary, to have one supreme appellate court for regu- 
lating all other judiciak, tribunals already and to be hereafter established, was to 
have one great university which should guide all lesser institutions, private and pub- 
lic, of every grade, and become the center whither aspirants in all branches in time 
should resort for complete special requisitions. 
That the people of Georgia, despite this one unhappy mistake, have always been 
disposed toward education of its youth of both sexes, indeed fully as much so as 
those of any other State in the Union, has been over and often evinced. To mention 
only the Wesleyan Female College, at Macon (claimed to be the oldest of its kind in 
the world), and its nearly or quite tiwenty followers in several other towns and vil- 
lages, the general assembly, from time to time, made appropriations to existing acad- 
emies, and various provisions designed to give education to all, including the poor. 
As early as 1792, and later, in 1810, acts were passed authorizing disposition of part 
of the proceeds of the sales of confiscated property among the four academies then 
in existence. In 1817 an act was passed, as follows: 
“Whereas it is universally acknowledged that in all well-regulated governments, 
and particularly that form of government under which we have the happiness to 
live, the education of youth, and the general advancement of useful knowledge, are 
objects of primary importance; and 
“Whereas the present system of education in this State is not well calculated for 
the general diffusion and equal distribution of useful learning: 
“Src. I. Be it therefore enacted, §'c., That from and immediately after the passage 
of this act the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars be, and the same is 
hereby, set apart and appropriated for the future endowment and support of free 
schools throughout this State: Provided, That nothing contained herein shall prevent 
any future general assembly from repealing the whole or any part of the aboye- 
recited law.” 
This evinces both the universal desire to promote education and the incipient lack 
of trustful support of the university, and want of intelligence as to the precise 
definite purpose to which the appropriation ought to be devoted. 
An attempt at definiteness was made in the year 1820 by the following act: 
“All such funds as now are or hereafter may come into the possession of this 
State, or may hereafter become due to the-same on account of confiscated or reverted 
property or the sales thereof, and for forfeited land, and all such funds as may accrue 
to the State undér the several escheat laws thereof, provided such escheated property 
has not been heretofore set apart to other special purposes by law, be, and the same 
is hereby, set apart as a fund for the promotion of literature and the advancement 
of the county academies in the manner heretofore pointed out. 
“Sec, II. The fund herein contemplated and set apart for literature purposes shall 
be distributed among the county academies in this State in such proportions as 
appear to be still due as contemplated by the act of 1792.” 
In the following year, December 21, 1821, the sum of $500,000 was set apart, “the 
one half for the support and encouragement of free schools and the other half for 
the endowment of county academies.” 
Yet distrust was exhibited in Section VI, the last, by the words, ‘ Nothing in this 
act contained shall be so construed as to prevent any future general assembly from 
altering or repealing this act, or any part thereof.” 
The action of subsequent legislatures on the subject of education shows earnest 
appreciation of its importance and as earnest zeal for its advancement and universal 
_ diffusion; but these generous sentiments failed of great results because of, what

became at last, settled departure from the plan considered by Baldwin and continued 
want of leaders who were or could he made by study and reflection competent for 
their direction. Instead of providing first for the highest, the idea grew that exist- 
ing degrees were as high as there was any need for, and the strain was to let every 
youth in the State have a share in such as was to be gotten. Committees, changing 
in their make-up every year, made vague reports on existing conditions as they came 
to them by hearsay, and suggested indefinite resolutions regarding future action. 
Charges came from the poor that discriminations were made in the odious act cre- 
ating the poor school fund between their children and the children of the rich. 
These with others of general mismanagement of the moneys appropriated for educa- 
tion had most discouraging effect. The committee of the legislature of 1828 said: 
“Such has been the irregular manner in which the reports of academies and free 
schools have been made that they find it impossible to give such a condensed view 
of them as can lead to any correct conclusion as to their real state and condition. 
They had found out but one fact, that, with some honorable exceptions, there had 
been. great waste and misapplication of the funds.”! 
More gloomy yet was the report in the following year, 1829: 
“That the present free-school system of the State of Georgia is miserably defective 
your committee have had but too mortifying testimony in the returns of the several 
counties submitted to their inspection during the present session. The fund set 
apart for free schools, although entirely inadequate to effect the important desider- 
atum of furnishing the means for a plain and substantial education to every family 
in the State under a more regular and economical administration, has, it is feared, 
been dissipated with comparative little benefit.”! 
Again, in a brief report of the committee appointed by the session of 1836, occur 
these words: 
“From all the information before your committee, there is great imperfection 
apparent in this system of education, and great laxity in the disbursement of this 
fund [the poor school], calling for a thorough reformation.” 
Yet it seems that the committee did not point out the errors in the system, nor to 
what particulars reformation should be directed. Such committees were composed of 
its own members, lawyers, planters, merchants, who, although some were educated 
persons, were without experience in such matters, and must therefore make indefi- 
nite reports upon a system which, so far as they had investigated, seemed to be in 
sore need of betterment, the means of which they left to the legislature in its col- 
lected wisdom to devise. If ever committees had indispensable need of experts to 
conduct their examinations, these did so. Yetit is to be questioned if upon any one 
a teacher was employed, for no teacher with a school worth the keeping could afford 
to go to the legislature, Abandoning for two months his business, which none but 
himself could satisfactorily conduct. Doubtless such committees rose as briefly as 
possible after deciding in their own minds that changes of some sort were sadly 
needed to be made by somebody. 
It was thus that State education languished for years and years, while all minds 
were honestly desirous that it should flourish if only could be entertained the proper 
mode of inaugurating, and cultivating, and supporting it. The one sole want was 
a university—a university in fact asinname. The institution so named began with 
fair prospects, when Josiah Meigs, a scholarly man, took his seat as its head. So had 
been the beginning of the old universities under one competent leader, who from 
time to time drew others who were his likes. So began the University of Pennsyl- 
vania, when Dr, Shippen, after completing his education abroad opened a room of 
his office in Philadelphia for students in medicine. So began Johns Hopkins Uni- 
versity when Dr. Gilman came to Baltimore, and commenced the calling, at discreet 
intervals, of that list of distinguished teachers, who, under his thorough leadership 
during one score of years, have made it renowned throughout the world. The

premature death of Baldwin was a misfortune whose consequences are still felt after 
the passing of near a century. -His wisdom and sagacity, and the honor in which he 
and his counsels were held, would have forestalled the accidents which served to 
withdraw from the institution he had founded the warm affection felt by the whole 
people-at its inception. The complaints herein aforementioned, whether reasonable 
or not, those in control seemed to take little pains to regard or endeavor to reconcile. 
It was, therefore, that when the religious denominations took into their own hands 
the higher education of their youth, a sense of relief came not only to a majority of 
the people, but to the legislature which had been long partially handling the sub- 
ject in which they seemed to have little patience because of habitual neglect of pains 
that would have led to sufficient acquaintance with its multifold needs and the 
means to supply them. This sense of relief on the part of the legislature appears in 
the adopted report and resolution of the year 1834, which express ‘‘a cordial appro- 
bation of the manual-labor system of education, and a willingness to foster and 
encourage the efforts making to that end by several religious denominations.”' 
These denominations, after trial of the manual-labor system for a few years’ aban- 
doned it as impracticable. 
This much, however, must be said of those institutions. Within them numbers of 
young men have been educated to the degree which they were able to impart far 
greater than would have been if they had not existed; that is, assuming that dis- 
satisfaction with the State university was to continue. In that view they have done 
much good by doubling and trebling the work being done by the university better 
than which was not possible in the State during the continuance of existing condi- 
tions. Unfortunately the degree thus attainable in college has seemed to all, with 
now and then an exception, satisfactory, and so the State has been without eminent 
native specialists in any department. Action upon this line has been directed by the 
idea settled in the majority of minds everywhere, that it is better to give moderate 
education to the multitude than the very highest to a few, ignoring the fact that the 
latter policy is of all the most efficacious in effecting the former. If, through legis- 
lative enactments (a thing not very probable) or private benefactions, the State col- 
lege shall become a university indeed, complete in all its appointments, then perhaps 
a monument, other than the small slab on the outer wall of one of the college build- 
ings inscribed with his name and another’s, will be erected to the memory of Abram 
Baldwin.

  CHAPTER XVII. 
HORACE MANN. 
The educational history of our country is divided roughly into two 
epochs—that of rural and that of urban education. This is also the 
struggle that is going on now—to eliminate rural methods and supplant 
them by urban methods—for it often happens that a city grows in 
population but is slow to avail itself of the opportunity that a large 
population and accumulated wealth afford for superior methods of 
instruction. 
The number of cities within the United States containing 8,000 inhab- 
itants and upward was in 1790 only 6; between 1800 and 1810 it increased 
to 11; in 1820, 13; in 1830, 26; in 1840, 44. In the fifty years between 
1840 and 1890 it increased from 44 to 443, or ten times the former num- 
ber. The urban population in this country in 1790 was, according to 
the Superintendent of the Census, only 1 in 30 of the population; in 1840 
it had increased to 1 in 12; in 1890, to1 in 3. In fact, if we count the 
towns on the railroads that are made urban by their close connections 
with large cities, and the suburban districts, it is safe to say that now 
one-half of the population is urban. 
In sparsely settled regions a district of 4 square miles will furnish 
only 20, 30, or 40 children of school age, and it follows as a matter of 
course that the schools were small, their annual sessions very short, the 
funds to pay teachers scarce, the teachers themselves poorly educated. 
and not professionally trained. Tor the first forty years of this nation 
such was the condition of nine-tenths of all the schools. By 1830 the: 
growth of cities began to be felt. 
As villages grew, and after the railroad had connected them to the - 
large cities, bringing them into contact with urban life, graded schools 
began to exist and to hold an annual session of ten or eleven months. 
This required the services of a person whose entire vocation was teach- 
ing. One of the chief defects of the rural district school was to be found 
in the fact that the man who taught the winter school took up teaching 
as a mere makeshift, depending on his other business or trade (surveyor 
or clerk or farmer, etc.) for his chief support. There was small chance

for the acquirement of any knowledge of the true methods of teaching. 
Another evil, more prominent than the former, was the letting down of 
standards caused by the low qualifications of the average committeeman. 
The town as a whole could afford a school committee of high qualifica- 
tions; the average district rarely. The township system, therefore, 
attains a far higher standard of efficiency than the district system. 
‘When the villages began to catch the urban spirit and establish 
graded schools with a full annual session there came a demand for a 
higher order of teacher—the professional teacher, in short. This caused 
a comparison of ideals, and the most enlightened in the community began 
an agitation of the school question, and supervision was demanded. In 
Massachusetts, where the urban civilization had made most progress, 
this agitation resulted in the formation of a State board of education in 
1837 and the employment of Horace Mann as its secretary (June, 1837). 
Boston had been connected with Providence and Worcester and Lowell 
by railroads before 1835, and in 1842 the first great trunk railroad had 
been completed through Springfield to Albany, opening to Boston a 
communication with the great West by the Erie Canal and the newly 
completed railroad from Albany to Buffalo. This was the beginning 
of the great urban epoch in America that has gone on increasing in 
potency to this day. 
Horace Mann came to the head of education in Massachusetts just at 
the beginning of this epoch of railroads and the growth of cities. He 
attacked with unsparing severity the evils of the schools as he found 
them, these evils being chiefly the survivals of the rural-school epoch. 
The school-district system, introduced into Connecticut in 1701, into 
Rhode Island about 1750, and into Massachusetts in 1789, was pro- 
nounced by Horace Mann to be the most disastrous feature in the whole 
history of educational legislation in Massachusetts. Side by side with 
the new impulse given to education in the villages, no doubt the dis- 
trict system seemed very bad. Its evils were manifest in the opposition 
to central graded schools, which were needed in the populous villages, 
but which would break up the oid district lines. Local power is never 
given up to a central power without a struggle. The stubbornness of 
this contest on the part of local committeemen was continued long after 
the adoption of the township system in Massachusetts and elsewhere. 
The district fought for its “rights” through its representatives on the 
town board, thereby postponing the feasible consolidation of districts 
and the formation of properly classified schools. 
Let us dwell a moment on this advantage of consolidated or “ union” 
schools, so called, in New York State and the West. In the rural 
school, isolated as it was, all grades of pupils from the lowest primary 
up to the secondary came together under one master, who had to give 
individual instruction to each, finding only five minutes or a little more 
for such lesson. Under such circumstances he could not well manage 
over 20 or 30 pupils. In his classes, each formed of one pupil in those 
 
-P-A-G-E-965
    HORACE MANN. . 889 
branches other than reading and spelling, he might have done better 
teaching had he’ had two pupils instead of one, for the child learns 
almost as much from paying attention to the efforts of his classmate to 
recite as from his own. A skillful teacher can make a recitation by an 
entire class of 20 or 30 pupils of even grade of advancement far more 
instructive to each pupil than a private tutor can'make the same lesson 
to his one pupil. The other pupils of the class furnish a sort of bridge 
between the teacher’s mind (that sees or should see the topic under 
discussion in its relations to all human learning) and the individual 
pupil’s mind (that sees the topic in its barest outlines and has scarcely 
learned its relations to other topics), for each pupil gets some one- 
sided view of it for himself in preparing his lesson and sees in the class 
exercise (which we call “recitation” in our American school technique) 
many other one-sided views presented by his fellow-pupils, who are not 
likely to repeat his one-sided view, but to have others, equally distorted, 
of their own. 
Suppose two ungraded schools to be united in one and divided again 
according to grade, the 30 pupils youngest and in lowest elementary 
studies taken by one teacher and the other 30 pupils taken by the 
other teacher. One-half of the number of classes is saved by consoli- 
dation and each teacher has twice as much time for each class exercise 
or recitation. He can find more time to go into the merits of the sub- 
ject when he has ten minutes instead of five minutes. 
In a populous village a school of 500 pupils is collected. There is a 
teacher for each 50 pupils, making 10 in all; for nearly twice as many 
pupils can be taught by each teacher in a well-graded school as in an 
ungraded school. Each of these 10 teachers divides his 50 pupils into 
two classes according to advancement, and classes average a half year’s 
difference in their intervals of progress from the classes above or below. 
He has thirty minutes for each recitation. It is now possible to pro- 
mote a bright pupil, who is not finding enough to do in the tasks set 
for his class, to the next class above, for he can soon make up what 
he has omitted by the leap from one class to another. So, too, a 
pupil who is falling behind his class can take up his work with the next 
class below and find it better suited to his powers. 
It was an insight into this principle that led Martin Luther to insist 
on grading the schools. The Jesuits, who were the first to seize on the 
chief weapon of the Protestants—namely, education for the people— 
and turnit against them in the interest of the Catholic Church, formed 
a school system in 1590, and also took much pains with grading and 
classification. 
Horace Mann’s efforts did not at once abolish the district system in 
Massachusetts, but they prevailed to consolidate districts in populous 
sections of the State. His school reports were widely read outside of 
the State, and spread the agitation of the school question into Rhode 
Island, Connecticut, and New York, and elsewhere. Connecticut

succeeded in abolishing her district system in 1856, but Massachusetts 
clung to it until 1869, after several vain attempts to get rid of it. In 
this action she was followed by Maine in 1872. And this is what the 
State superintendent of Maine says of the evils of the district system 
in an able summary: 
First, the school moneys were inequably divided, some districts receiving much 
more than they could profitably expend, others much less than was absolutely needed; 
second, poor schoolhouses in remote and sparsely settled districts; third, short 
schools, or poor ones, if the agent attempted to lengthen them by hiring cheap 
teachers. Little money, poor schoolhouses, short schools are the necessary attend- 
-ants of this system. 
Horace Mann extended his criticisms and suggestions to the exami- 
‘nation of teachers and their instruction in institutes; to the improve- 
ment of school buildings; the raising of school funds by taxation; the 
creating of a correct public opinion on school questions; the care for 
vicious youth in appropriate schools. He discarded the hidebound 
text-book method of teaching and substituted the oral discussion of 
the topic in place of the memorizing of the words of the book. He 
encouraged school libraries and school apparatus. 
Horace Mann’s influence aided in founding the first normal school in 
the United States at Lexington (afterward removed to Framingham), 
and a second one at Barre, both in 1839, and a third one at Bridge- 
water, in the fall of the next year. 
Inspired by the example in Massachusetts, Connecticut was aroused 
by Henry Barnard, who carried through the legislature the act organ- 
izing a State board of commissioners, and became himself the first 
secretary of it (1849). In 1849 Connecticut established a normal school. 
In 1843 Mr. Barnard went to Rhode Island and assisted in drawing up 
the State school law, under which he became the first commissioner, 
and labored there for six years. 
These were the chief fermenting influences in education that have 
worked a wide change in the management of schools in the Middle and 
Western States within the past fifty years. Let us consider some of 
those points more in detail and get a little closer to the personality of 
the hero whom we commemorate here. 
There had been in Massachusetts from 1789 to 1839—a period of fifty 
years—an apparent retrogression of education. This apparent retro- 
gression was due to the increase of local self-government and the 
decrease of central, especially parochial, authority. It was a necessary 
and on the whole a healthful movement. The central power had been 
largely theocratic or ecclesiastical at the beginning. But the reaction 
against ecclesiastical control went too far in the direction of individual- 
ism. The farthest swing of the pendulum in this direction was reached 
in 1828, when the districts obtained the exclusive control of the schools 
in all matters except in the item of examination of teachers. The 
public schools diminished in efficiency, and a twofold opposition began 
 
-P-A-G-E-967
    HORACE MANN. 891 
some years before 1828, which took, on the one hand, the shape of an 
attempt to remedy the deficiency of public schools by the establish- 
ment of academies, and, on the other hand, that of a vigorous attack 
by educational reformers, such as Horace Mann and his devoted con- 
temporary, James G. Carter. The establishment of a State board of 
education and the appointment of Horace Mann as its secretary, there- 
fore, mark an era of return from the extreme of individualism to the 
proper union of local and central authority in the management of 
schools. 
Horace Mann’s function at this very important epoch was that of 
educational statesman. We must not permit our attention to be 
distracted from this point if we would behold the greatness and benefi- 
cence of his labors. Pestalozzi was essentially an educational mission- 
ary, a teacher of pupils in the first grade of the elementary school. 
Horace Mann was equally an educational missionary, for he conse- 
crated himself religiously to the task of promoting the school educa- 
tion of the people. Other people, all people, select vocations in which 
they are to work and earn a livelihood. But the missionary consecrates 
his whole life to a chosen work, not for what it will return to him in 
wealth or honor, but for the intrinsic worth of the object to be accom- 
plished as a good for the human race. 
The enthusiasm of Horace Mann shone out of his soul in his praise 
of the act of the Massachusetts legislature establishing the State board 
of education in 1837: 
This board I believe to be like a spring, almost imperceptible, flowing from the 
highest table-land, between oceans, which is destined to deepen and widen as it 
descends, diffusing fertility and beauty in its course, and nations shall dwell upon 
its banks. It is the first great movement toward an organized system of common 
education, which shall at once be thorough and universal. 
It was he that was to succeed in making that State board of educa- 
tion the fertilizing spring that he describes. It was a board with lim- 
ited powers. It could not found schools nor direct or manage them 
after they were founded. It could only collect information and diffuse 
it. It could persuade the people, but not command them. In a nation 
founded upon the idea of local self-government it was a very great 
achievement to show what can be accomplished by a board that'can 
not coerce but only persuade. This is the point of view to see Horace 
Mann’s greatness. One thinks of the potency of Peter the Hermit 
preaching a crusade. It was a crusade that Horace Mann preached in 
his twelve reports and in his hundreds of popular addresses, and in his 
thousands of letters, written with his own hand. 
The first report of Horace Mann, as secretary, was made in 1837, and 
contains the best statement ever made of the duties: of school com- 
mittees, especially in the selection of teachers. It sets forth the apathy 
of the people regarding the schools and regrets the employment of 
incompetent teachers. (48 pp.)
-P-A-G-E-968
  892 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
There was a supplementary report on schoolhouses which discussed 
the matter of ventilation and warming, the proper kind of desks, the 
location of the building, the lighting of the room, the playgrounds, and 
the duties of the teacher in regard to light and ventilation. (60 pp.) 
In the second report, 1838, there is much discussion of the method of 
teaching reading, whether by letters or by the word method. <A just 
criticism is made upon the character of the school reading books. 
(60 pp.) 
In the third report, 1839, he discusses the responsibility of the people 
for the improvement in common schools, the employment of children 
in manufactories, the importance of libraries, and the kind of books 
needed, the effect of reading on the formation of character, and recom- 
mends strongly the establishment of school-district libraries. (52 pp.) 
The fourth report, 1840, points out the desirability of union schools 
for the sake of grading and classifying the pupils and cheapening the 
cost of instruction. It shows the value of regularity and punctuality 
in attendance. (40 pp.) 
The fifth report, 1841, has a world-wide fame for its presentation of 
the advantages of education, the effect of it upon the fortunes of men, 
the production of property, the multiplication of human comforts, and 
all the elements of material well-being. He showed how education 
awakened thought, increased the resources of the individual, opening 
his eyes to the possibility of combinations not seen by the uneducated. 
The circular letter which he prepared, making inquiries of manufac- 
turers and men of business, is the most suggestive letter of its kind. 
This report deserves to be published in a pamphlet and placed in the 
hands of the people of every generation. (37 pp.) 
qn his sixth report, 1842, he presents the subject of physiology and 
its importance as a branch to be taught in the schools. (100 pp.) 
The seventh report, 1843, records his observations in Huropean 
schools, and starts endless questions regarding the methods of organi- 
zation and instruction, bringing into light the questions of corporal 
punishment and the overcultivation of the memory of words. He 
describes in an eloquent manner the evils of a partial system of educa- 
tion and treats in a judicial manner the advantages and disadvan- 
tages of the schools that he found in Scotland, Prussia, and Saxony. 
(190 pp.) 
In the eighth report, 1844, he treats of the employment of female 
teachers and of the method of conducting teachers’ institutes, teachers’ 
associations, and the study of vocal music. (30 pp.) 
In his ninth report, 1845, he discusses the motives to which the 
teacher should appeal, describes the school vices to be avoided, points 
out the transcendent importance of moral instruction, and shows how 
obedienee should be secured by affection and respect and not by fear. 
He treats of the dangers of truancy and the prevention of whispering, 
and a variety of practical difficulties that meet the teacher in the 
   
-P-A-G-E-969
  HORACE MANN. 893 
schoolroom and shows how to avoid the evils of emulation, and com- 
mends the system of instruction by induction instead of deduction 
and the importance of substituting investigation for memorizing. - 
(104. pp.) 
The tenth report, 1846, gives the history of the common-school system 
in Massachusetts and shows the relation which education holds to the 
future generations of the Commonwealth. (35 pp.) 
The eleventh report, 1847, makes a strong presentation of the power 
of the common schools to redeem the State from social evils and crimes. 
There is a circular letter of inquiry with regard to the effect of educa- 
tion in the prevention of vice and crime. The letter of 1841 had inquired 
regarding the effect of education upon thrift and industry. Replies 
obtained to the letter of 1847 gave encouraging facts and opinions in 
regard to the moral effect of school education. The report continues to 
diseuss the qualifications of teachers and the methods of securing reg- 
ular attendance of children, and paints a picture of the effect of 
universal education. 
Every follower of God and friend of human kind will find the only sure means of 
carrying forward the particular reform to which he is devoted ‘n universal educa- 
tion. In whatever department of philanthropy he may be engaged, he will find that 
department to be only a segment of the great circle of beneficence of which universal 
education is the center and circumference. (80 pp.) 
The twelfth and last report of Horace Maun presents anew the capacity 
of the common-school system to improve the pecuniary condition and 
elevate the intellectual, moral, and religious character of the Common- 
wealth, repeating with new force the arguments brought forward in 
previous reports. He shows the importance of religion and the reading 
of the Bible in the common school; shows the importance of health and 
the necessity of providing for physical training in the schoolroom; sets 
forth the necessity of the schools for the political education of the citi. 
zens. His devices to show the use of intelligence gained in the schools 
to the mechanic, the merchant, and the farmer seem inexhaustible. 
(120 pp.) 
As a consequence of the seventh report, which sets forth the advan- 
tages of the schools of Germany, there arose the famous controversy 
with the 31 Boston schoolmasters. : 
In studying the records of Massachusetts, one is impressed by the fact 
that every new movement in education has run the gauntlet of fierce 
and bitter opposition before adoption. The ability of the conservative 
party has always been conspicuous, and the friends of the new meas- 
ure have been forced to exert all their strength, and to eliminate one 
after another. the objectionable features discovered in advance by their 
enemies. To this fact is due the success of so many of the reforms and. 
improvements that have proceeded from this State. The fire of criti- 
cism has purified the gold from the dross in a large measure already 
before the stage of practical experiment has begun. In reviewing this 
long record of bitter quarrels over new measures that have now become 
 
-P-A-G-E-970
894 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
old and venerable because of their good results in all parts of the nation, 
we are apt to become impatient and blame too severely the conservative 
. party in Massachusetts. 
We forget that the opposition helped to perfect the theory of the 
reform, and did much to make it a real advance instead of a mere 
change from one imperfect method to another. Even at best, educa- 
tional changes are often only changes of fashion—the swing of the pen- 
dulum from one extreme to another—and sure to need correction by a 
fresh reaction. Again, it is patent in Massachusetts history that the 
defects of old methods were in great part remedied by the good sense 
and skill of many highly cultured teachers who still practiced them, 
and hence the wholesale denunciation of the old methods was felt to 
be unjust. The best teachers resented the attack on their methods. It 
seemed unfair, because it charged against the method all the mistakes 
committed by inexperience and stupidity, and because, too, it claimed 
more for the new device than could be realized. The old was condemned 
for its poor results in the hands of the most incompetent, while the 
new was commended as the ideal without considering what it would 
become in the hands of unfaithful teachers. . 
Take as an instance of this the use of text-books. Everyone will 
admit that what is called the “slavish use” of such means is a great 
evil. The memorizing of words and sentences, without criticism and 
reflection on their meaning, is a mechanical training of the mind and 
fit only for parrots. But on the other hand, the proper use of the 
printed page is the greatest of all arts taught in the school. How to 
get out of printed words and sentences the original thought and obser- 
vation recorded there—how to verify these and critically go over the 
steps of the author’s mind—this is the method of discovery and leads 
to the only real progress. For real progress comes from availing one’s 
self of the wisdoin of the race and using it as an instrument of new 
discovery. That other method sometimes commended, of original 
investigation without aid from books, forgets that mankind has toiled 
for long thousands of years to construct a ladder of achievement and 
that civilization is on the highest round of thisladder. It has invented 
school education in order that its youth may climb quickly to the top 
on the rounds which have been added one by one, slowly, in the lapse 
of ages. The youth shall profit vicariously by the thought and experi- 
ence of those who have gone before. For the child of the savage tribe 
there is no such vicarious thinking and living; he begins practically at 
the bottom of this ladder, with no rounds on which he may climb. 
Nov, there was in Massachusetts and elsewhere much excellent teach- 
ing in the academies and common schools—teaching which trained the 
pupil to criticise and verify instead of to accept the statements of the 
book with blind credulity. The good teachers knew that their methods 
were good and felt indignant to hear them caricatured and an inferior 
method recommended as a substitute.

HORACE MANN. 895 
For the merely oral method does not possess in it the capability of 
producing the independent scholar who can be trained by holding him 
responsible for mastering-critically the printed page and making alive 
again its thoughts and perceptions. It was a sense of something valu- 
able in the old method that was not touched by the criticisms of Horace 
Mann that led to the reply of the Boston masters. 
Here we come to the closer view of the character of Horace Mann. 
He was, like so many of the great men of the Puritans, modeled on the 
type of the Hebrew prophets. The close and continuous study of the 
characters portrayed in the Old Testament, the weekly sermons, most 
of which were studies of those characters, had educated all Puritans 
to see ideals of character in ancient leaders who devoted themselves to 
a cause and withstood popular clamor, fiercely denouncing whatever 
form of idol worship they saw among their countrymen. § 
The ideal of a strong, serious-minded, independent manhood, un- 
swerved by personal interest, thoroughly patriotic, and devoted to the 
public interest, it draws its support from a sense of righteousness that 
gives it a backbone coterminous with the axis on which the universe 
revolves. So long as this character is recognized and respected, and 
has in the main the support of the community, small and great, it 
stands firm like an oak, and thrives on the hostility of the elements in 
society that it opposes. 
But this species of character modeled on the Hebrew prophet, it 
should be said, is far more likely to be an inward tragedy than a gen- 
uine historical one. The average man puts on the air of a censor of 
his age or his community and develops an overweening egotism, or he 
poses as an unappreciated genius for poetry, or philosophy, or philan- 
thropy, or statesmanship, or theology, or ethical purity of character. 
The pathway of history for eighteen centuries is strewn with wrecked 
individualities of men who have become fanatics or cranks through the 
demoniac possession of a single idea and the self-delusion—a sugges- 
tion of the evil one—that they are exceptionally wise and gifted above 
their fellow-men; that they, in short, are right and the world all wrong. 
It is saved from being a tragedy in Horace Mann, and in other great 
men before and after who have personified this Hebrew-prophet type 
of reformer, by the greatness of the cause they have espoused and by 
their self-sacrificing devotion to it. 
The Great Teacher gave the one prescription to ward off the fatal 
disease that attacks this Hebrew individualism, and that prescription 
is humility and self-abasement. Its intellectual rule is the measure by 
service of one’s fellows: Be their servant if you would rule over them. 
But we have from this ideal the most important fruition of all human 
history, namely, the development of individualism and the formation 
of a set of institutions to nurture it. 
We have characters that are so strong that they can withstand any 
amount of opposition from their fellow-men and still stand erect with- . 
out fear. “One with God is a majority.”

  896 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
Thus Horace Mann was intrenched in his fundamental principle, and 
on all occasions returned to it to rally his strength. In his own words 
he describes his conviction and at the same time lays down the details 
of his policy and methods of winning success: 
The education of the whole people in a republican government can never be 
attained without the consent of the whole people. Compulsion, even if it were 
desirable, is not an available instrument. Enlightenment, not coercion, is our 
resource. The nature of education must be explained. The whole mass of mind 
must be instructed in regard to its comprehension and enduring interests. We can 
not drive our people up a dark avenue, even though it be the right one; but we 
must hang the starry lights of knowledge about it, and show them not only the 
directness of its course to the goal of prosperity and honor, but the beauty of the 
way that leads to it. 
In some districts there will be but a single man or woman, in some towns scarcely 
half a dozen men or women, who have espoused this noble enterprise; but whether 
there be half a dozen or but one, they must be like the little leaven which a woman 
took and hid in three measures of meal. Let the intelligent visit the ignorant day 
by day, as the oculist visits the blind man and detaches the scales from his eyes, 
until the living sense leaps in the living light. 
Let the zealous seek contact and communion with those who are frozen up in 
indifference, and thaw off the icebergs wherein they lie embedded. Let the love of 
beautiful childhood, the love of country, the dictates of reason, the admonitions of 
conscience, the sense of religious responsibility, be plied in mingled tenderness and 
earnestness until the obdurate and dark mass of avarice, ignorance, and prejudice 
shall be dissipated by their blended light and heat. 
He preached the same doctrine regarding the right of the state to 
educate at public expense that James G. Carter had preached. It is 
stated in these simple propositions: 
1, The successive generations of men, taken collectively, constitute a great com- 
monwealth, ‘ 
2. The property of the commonwealth is pledged for the education of all its youth 
up to such a point as will save them from poverty and vice and prepare them for 
adequate performance of their social and civil duties. 
3. The successive holders of this property are trustees bound to the faithful exe- 
cution of this trust by the most sacred obligations; and the embezzlement and 
pillage from children and descendants have not less of criminality, but far more than 
the same offenses when perpetrated against contemporaries. 
The net result of Mr. Mann’s labors in his great career as educa- 
tional statesman is put tersely by Mr. Martin in these words: 
In the evolution of the Massachusetts public schools during these twelve years of 
Mr. Mann’s labors, statistics tell us that the appropriations for public schools had 
doubled; that more than $2,000,000 had been spent in providing better schoolhouses; 
that the wages of men as teachers had increased 62 per cent, of women 51 per cent, 
while the whole number of women employed as teachers had increased 54 per cent; 
one month had been added to the average length of the schools; the ratio of private- 
school expenditures to those of the public schools had diminished from 75 per cent to 
36 per cent; the compensation of school committees had been made compulsory, and 
their supervision was more. general and more constant; three normal schools had 
been established, and had sent out several hundred teachers, who were making 
themselves felt in all parts of the State.!

  HORACE MANN. 897 
In conclusion, I suggest again the thought of Mr. Mann as a charac- 
ter inspired with missionary zeal to reform society by means of the 
school system. It was this missionary zeal that led him to advocate in 
the Massachusetts legislature the first insane asylum and secure its 
establishment; to favor the establishment of asylums for deaf, dumb, 
and blind; to secure normal schools, humane school discipline, meth- 
ods of instruction that appeal to the child’s interest and arouse him to 
self-activity, and finally to devote the evening of his life to the Antioch 
College experiment. 
It is this missionary zeal for the school that works so widely and in 
so many followers to-day. What enthusiastic teacher is not proud to 
be called a disciple of Horace Mann? ‘

LETTER TO THE COMMISSIONER. 
1918 SUNDERLAND PLACE, 
Washington, D. C., 9 Dec., 1896. 
Dear Sir. I accede very gladly to your offer to publish in your annual report the 
material I have gathered for a bibliography of my father, Horace Mann. Iregret that 
the work is not more complete. 
Ihave in my possession many interesting and valuable fragments of publications 
on the subject, which cannot be included in this list because I do not know where 
or when they were published. I have also a large number of indefinite references 
to publications which I have not been able to see. Beyond these, I have reason to 
believe that much material exists of which I know nothing. 
Lavail myself of the opportunity afforded by this publication to ask all persons. 
kindly disposed to acquaint me with the titles of all publications relating to Horace 
Mann, not mentioned in this list, that I may further complete the work. I would 
like to receive definite references, and to know where the publications can be found. 
I-would like also to obtain copies where such can be had. 
Yours respectfully,

CORRELATION OF STUDIES. 
[The two following papers continue the discussion aroused by the report of the 
Committee of Fifteen, from a new point of view.] 
IsOLATION AND UNIFICATION AS BASES OF CouRSES OF STUDY.! 
By Emerson E. White, LL. D., Columbus, Ohio. 
An important condition in the development of any science is the use of clearly 
defined terms to denote its facts and principles. This is strikingly illustrated in the 
development of the natural and physical sciences. The terminology of chemistry, 
physics, and biology has made these sciences possible. It is difficult to see how they 
could be presented in language without the use of definite technical terms, not only 
to denote phenomena, but principles and laws. Most of the terms in the present 
science of electricity lie outside of the vocabulary of the general scholar, and are 
known only to specialists in the science. The same is true, to a greater or less 
degree, of all the modern trades, professions, and arts. Each has a large glossary of 
technical terms peculiar to itself, each term having a definite meaning. 
It is one of the recognized infelicities of the science of psychology that so many of 
its terms are in general literature, where they are used with varying and often 
diverse significations. Indeed, one of the first conditions of the intelligent reading 
of a work on psychology is the determining of the definite meaning of the terms used. 
by the author—not always an easy task. No psychologist who uses important terms 
in different senses, or with the meaning obscure, can be a successful author. Thisis 
specially true in that branch of psychology known as moral science or ethics. Much 
of the inconclusive and fruitless discussion which besets the student of ethics is due 
tothe fact that the disputants use terms in different senses. A common source of 
disagreement is the use of words by one party with a larger or smaller content than 
the other, and this is true even when these contents contain a considerable common 
elemeat. 
We thus approach one of the serious obstacles in the development of a science of 
pedagogy. Its terminology presents a most striking contrast to that of the physical 
sciences. Many of its terms are borrowed from psychology and ethics, not a few 
from philosophy, and these from authors who use the same terms in different senses. 
Indeed, the science of pedagogy has a very small vocabulary of technical terms, 
which are used by all writers with the same meaning. This fact is the source of wide 
confusion in thought and much fruitless discussion. It must be evident to every 
careful observer that the movement in recent pedagogical inquiry is the reverse of 
the movement in 6ther modern sciences. Instead of careful differentiation and the 
use of special terms to denote things that differ, there is in pedagogy much ambi- 
tious generalization and the use of terms that express indefinite and vague entities— 
terms that have been appropriately called ‘blanket words,” since they so readily 
cover a group of diverse ideas. I frankly confess that I read articles and listen to

addresses on pedagogy that baffle my understanding, not, as I flatter myself, because 
they are too deep for me, but because of their vagueness and obscurity. Much of 
the present conflict of opinion in pedagogy is largely due to the fact that those who 
differ do not understand each other, and itis doubtful ifeach one always under- 
stands himself. 
We have an instructive example of this difficulty in the discussion of the past year 
over the place and value of “correlation,” “coordination,” and ‘concentration” in 
school instruction. Tho discussion has been a Babel confusion of ideas, if not of 
tongues, and well-meant attempts to settle the pedagogical meaning of these terms 
have only added to the confusion. After all that has been said, several writers for 
tho educational journals are using the incongruous terms coordination and concen- 
tration as synonymous. One of the surprises of the profession was the expressed 
expectation that a recent report on the “ correlation of studies” would be deyoted to 
a discussion of the theory of concentration! 
The desire to be understood in the present paper has led me to avoid, as far as 
possible, these badly mixed up terms, and to use instead terms that are more defi- 
nite and fundamenial. For this purpose I have selected the terms ‘‘ isolation” and 
“ynification” as denoting opposite processes and results. 
The term isolation, as used herein, denotes the separation of a branch of study 
from other branches for the purposes of instruction—the teaching of it in a separate 
exercise. I do not use the term in the sense of exclusion. The isolation of a branch 
of knowledge in instruction does not involve the exclusion of all the facts and skill 
that may have their origin in other branches. For example, the isolation of arith- 
metic as a school exercise does not mean that the data for its problems may not be 
taken from another branch of study. It simply means the making of instruction and 
drill in number the central and controlling end of the exercise, the unit of activity. 
The same is true of isolation as applied to the other branches of the course. 
Tho term unification is used in a contrary sense. The unification of two or more 
branches of study means their union in instruction in such manner as makes them 
one branch, with a common sequence of facts, and taught with a common end or pur- 
pose. The term is not limited to any particular mode of uniting the several subje 
For our present purpose it makes no difference whether they are united as coordi- 
nate elements, or whether one is made the principal or core and the others subordi- 
nated to it, as we construct complex sentences. ' 
The term unification is, however, exclusive of isolation. It does not include the 
teaching of branches in separate exercises, however skillfully these exercises are 
related to each other. If two branches are taught in separate exercises, each having 
its appropriate and special development, they are not unified in any true pedagog- 
ical sense. For the purposes of instruction they are isolated. Noris this fact of 
isolation changed if the several separate exercises all center in the pupil and actu- 
ally contribute to one teaching result. All rational instruction necessarily centers 
in the pupil, and in this respect methods do not essentially differ. The essential fact 
in complete unification is the unity of the subjects or branches in actual instruction— 
their oneness in the teaching process. 
This leads to the natural division of the studies of a school course into coordinate 
groups or unities. Fortunately this subject has been too ably and too exhaustively 
discussed in this presence to require further elucidation. The only question is whether 
there are more or less than five coordinate groups of studies. Dr. Harris admits 
that there is a sixth coordinate group of knowledge, the one that includes religious 
truth—the fifth in Dr. Thomas Hill’s ‘‘hierarchy of studies;” and Dr. De Garmo’s 
earnest plea for the recognition of three coordinate groups, the third being called the 
“Ceconomic,” necessitates, if conceded, the adding of a seventh coordinate group—a 
group that includes drawing, construction, book keeping, etc., and better designated 
as the “industrial art” group. Whether these two additional coordinate groups 
be, or be not, recognized as belonging to the school course does not concern our    
   
-P-A-G-E-1007
  CORRELATION OF STUDIES. q 931 
present purpose. The important fact is that, while these coordinate groups, whether 
five or seven, have certain interrelations, they have a different origin, a different 
law of sequence, and, as a consequence, a different development; and it follows that 
no one of these coordinate groups can be united with another coordinate group by 
making the one or the other subordinate. Coordinate entities can not be unified on 
the principle ef subordination. This is a fact of prime importance in pedagogy. If 
the existence of coordinate groups of studies be once conceded, the Ziller theory of 
concentration is left in the air, since this involves subordination. 
lt is also plain that, in discussing the question of unification, a clear distinction 
must be made between the unifying of allied subjects in the same group and the 
unifying of subjects that belong in different coordinate groups. A failure to obserye 
this distinction is resulting in much confusion. There is necessarily a close relation 
between subjects in the same natural group, and their union at different points in 
instruction may, as a consequence, be both feasible and desirable. But the unifying 
of coordinate branches is a different matter. Take, for example, the several subjects 
that make up the mathematical group. Whether arithmetic, algebra, and geometry 
shall be taught tandem, or the clements of algebra and concrete geometry run abreast 
of arithmetic in the latter part of the arithmetical course, is a pedagogical question 
that can be best settled by experience. This is simply the proper correlation of 
allied subjects within a group. But the harnessing of mathematics to history or to 
natural science is another procedure. It constitutes a team of pedagogic animals 
that do not naturally travel the same road or in the same direction. 
The unifying of allied subjects within a group and the unification of separate 
coordinate groups are very different pedagogic problems. The distinction has a 
parallel in the difference of the powers of the signs ++ and — and the signs x and — 
in algebra, the former denoting relations between terms and the latter the relations 
of numbers within a term. It is important to keep this distinction in mind, for it is 
easy to pick out facts, and even groups of facts, in allied subjects which are so 
closely related that they may be taught together with obvious advantage, and then 
cite these instances as evidence that unification is a universal principle of teaching. 
It should also be kept in mind that the unifying of closely related facts or groups 
of facts selected from separate branches is not the unification of the branches as 
wholes. A teacher may, for example, use the transparency of glass to illustrate the 
meaning of a lucid style in writing, but this would hardly be the unification of 
physics and rhetoric. The pedagogic purpose is not to teach the transparency of 
glass. The same is true when the skill acquired in one branch is used as an aid in 
teaching another. Thus, skill in drawing may be utilized in teaching geography, 
but this is not, in any true sense, tho unification of drawing and geography, and, 
whenever it may be desirable to call such a procedure unification, care should be 
taken not to broaden the meaning to a unifying of the branches of study. 
We are prepared to ask whether either isolation or unification can be made the 
basis of a course of study. It may be helpful in this inquiry to note that each of 
these principles may haye three quite distinct degrees of application, as follows: 
INsoLaTIOn.—First degree: Complete; all branches taught separately throughout 
the course. Second degree: General isolation, with incidental blendings; especially in 
primary instruction, including the language arts. Third degree: Coordinate branches 
for development and drill, with rational blendings of allied subjects when relations 
are close and helpful; especially in elementary instruction. 
Unirication.—Third degree: Allied subjects at points of close relation, especially 
in elementary instruction, with isolation of all coordinate branches for special devel- 
opment and drill. Second degree: Groups; all branches united in two or three 
coordinate groups, cach with a central core; incidental isolation of branches for 
special development and drill. First degree: Complete; all branches united in one 
organic whole, with a central core. 
Tt is here seen that isolation is considered complete when it applies to each branch -

932 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
of instruction, whether the erid be knowledge or skill, and to each branch from the 
beginning to the end of the course. It seems unnecessary to add that this degree 
of isolation is not found in the American school. Spelling and reading were united 
more or less closely long before I was a pupil, and the same has long been true of the 
elements in other allied branches. Complete isolation is neither practicable nor 
desirable. 
The second degree of isolation more nearly represents the practice of the modern 
school, The coordinate groups of studies are isolated in instruction, except in the 
lowest grades, and the well-defined branches in each group are taught, as a rule, in 
separate exercises. There is, however, an increasing blending of the school arts, 
especially in primary grades, the arts of reading, spelling, writing, and language 
having many close relations and possibly interunions. Advantage is also taken of 
the natural relations between allied subjects, and there is much incidental blending 
of these subjects in actual instruction. But in many schools unification is not intel- 
ligently sought as an end. What is done in this direction is incidental, and only the 
more simple associations are attempted. Isolation is the dominant principle, unifica- 
tion being incidental and exceptional. 
The third degree of isolation will be best explained in connection with the same 
degree of unification. 
Complete unification is the blending of all subjects and branches of study into 
one whole and the teaching of the same in successive sections. When this union is 
effected by making one group or branch of study in the course the center or core 
and subordinating all other subjects to it, the process is properly called the concen- 
tration of studies. In such a unification of subjects the principle of sequence and 
development of the central or core study necessarily dominates the entire group, 
and the proper development of each subordinate study is sacrificed. Nor is this 
result ayoided by making the child the center, whatever this may mean, since this 
ignores the principle of development in all branches, Complete unification of school 
studies is neither practicable nor desirable. 
In the second degree of unification all branches and subjects are united in two or 
three coordinate groups, each with a central core. It recognizes coordination as a 
true and fundamental principle in a course of school studies; and it allows each 
coordinate group to have its own principle of development, contenting itself with 
those natural and simple associations which are easily established between subjects 
in the same group. It also permits the isolation of the coordinate branches in actual 
instruction, and their systematic treatment. All this means much, for, if the prin- 
ciple of isolation applies to coordinate groups because they are coordinate, it neces- 
sarily applies to all the coordinate groups in a course, whatever be the number of 
such groups. 
If the attempt to subordinate mathematics to literature or history leads to fantastic 
results, as is conceded, the same will be true of an attempt to subordinate either 
physical or biological science to the so-called culture studies, Hence the argument 
for two or for three coordinate groups, each with its own sequence and development, 
concedes the whole ground; and we thus again reach the fact, making one subor- 
dinate to the other. Coordination excludes subordination. 
A glance at the outline given above will suffice to show that the third degree of 
unification and the third degree of isolation are practically the same. They differ 
chiefly in emphasis, one putting the emphasis on unification and the other on isola- 
tion. Both agree in the unification of allied subjects and closely related facts, and 
both require the isolation of coordinate branches for development and drill. Neither 
proposes to subject one branch of study to the principle of development that belongs 
to another, but each branch and subject is to receive such separate treatment as its 
nature demands. Both agree that unification is most feasible in elementary instruc- 
tion where the association of facts is simple and easy. 
It is obvious from this survey that the application of the principle of unification 
falls largely within the details of actual instruction. If closely related facts in 
 
-P-A-G-E-1009
CORRELATION OF STUDIES. 933 
different branches are to be united in instruction, it must be done by the living teacher; 
and hence the problem of unification belongs more to the art of instruction than to 
the curriculum of studies. The curriculum should, however, not only include the 
five coordinate groups of studies, but the sequence in each group should correspond 
with the psychical development and progress of the pupil. Since human knowledge 
is the result of human knowing, every branch of study has natural phases that cor- 
respond to the physical phases through which pupils pass as they ascend in the 
course. <A true course of study not only properly correlates the five coordinate 
groups of studies, but it cuts off a section of each in every round of its ascent. It 
thus adjusts, so far as this can be done in a scheme of studies, the exercises and dis- 
ciplines of the school to the psychical condition and needs of the mind. Studies are 
thus put in right interrelation by being put in right relations to the pupil. The 
child is, in this psychological sense, thé center of the course of study. 
These facts suggest the mischief that may lurk in an exaggerated view of the 
importance of unifying all the studies of a child. The attempt, for example, to 
associate every fact of nature with literature may give now and then a beautiful, 
even striking, lesson; but nine-tenths of the important facts of nature can not be 
hitched to a poem. The attempt to establish such associations inevitably results in 
fantastic, and even ridiculous, combinations. Nor can I see much promise in the 
-effort to unify all branches of instruction by universal relations. There may be a 
“causal flexus” that binds all knowledge into an organic unity, but children are not 
philosophic spiders that gather knowledge by excursions over a web of philosophic 
causation. 
It is seen from the foregoing survey of the subject that the principle of unification 
can not be made the basis of a rational course of instruction—much less of a curric- 
ulum of school studies. Its most fruitful applications are in teaching allied sub- 
jects within the several coordinate groups, and here chiefly in teaching the elements. 
It also has an important place in teaching the more closely related facts in different 
coordinate groups, known facts in one group being used in teaching related facts in 
another group. Here is the recognized field for the practical application of the 
principle of unification, and such application promises valuable results. 
But the obvious principle that underlies not only courses of study but methods of 
teaching, is the fact that every coordinate branch of study has its own natural 
sequence and development, requiring its isolation and separate treatment. Instead 
of the concentration of all branches of study by subordinating all the rest to one 
central core, there must be increasing differentiation and isolation, with proper recog- 
nition, of course, of all important interrelations. It thus appears that isolation is 
the dominating principle in a true course of study, unification having its place and 
function chiefly in the processes of instruction. 
One more observation seems a fitting conclusion to this study. It does not follow 
that facts taught separately remain isolated in the pupil’s thought. The mind is 
endowed with the power of assimilation and unification, and this power is more 
fundamental in education than is dreamed of by some philosophers. Were the assimi- 
lation of knowledge or the unification of mental power dependent upon the philo- 
sophic mixing of the materials of instruction in the mind’s hopper, I fear that most 
of us now present would be idiots. We have all been doing a litttle assimilating 
and unifying our own account, and have actually been able to see some of the 
simpler relations between facts not learned in the same school exercise, or in the 
same day, or even in the same year. It may be true that few of us have seen many 
of the “universal relations,” which, according to the somewhat uncertain testimony 
‘of philosophy, binds all knowledge into one “organic unity,” but we hope to get 
more of these insights, at least in the next world. Nor are we much comforted with 
the suggestion that a child can be made to feel the oneness of all knowledge, even 
though he may not intellectually apprehend it. The feeling of a truth not present 
in the mind seems to border on mystery! It is a wise child that sees the immediate 
relation between the more common facts of observation and experience.

  934 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
  ON THE CORRELATION OF ELEMENTARY STuDrEs.! 
By George H. Howison, LL. D., Mills professor of philosophy in the University of California. 
What Iam about to say to you, fellow-teachers, may well enough be taken as a 
sort of introduction to the inquiries which the committee from our State council of 
education has invited you to undertake during the year now opening—I mean the 
inquiries (1) into the course of study that is best for elementary schools, and (2) 
into the arrangement of the chosen studies that is most suitable in view of the edu- 
cational aims. You listened to our committee’s report with patient, nay, with 
interested attention, and you doubtless noted, at its close a few moments ago, the 
course of reading recommended as auxiliary to your study of the various questions 
proposed. You therefore can not have failed to take especial notice of the promi- 
nence given in that course of reading to the two reports, now heard of everywhere, 
sent out to the educational world by our National Educational Association. I refer, 
of course, to the report of the committee of ten and the report of the committee of 
fifteen. 
These two reports are named by the committee from our State council as the pri- 
mary and chief texts by which your studies on the clementary curriculum and its 
arrangement are to be guided. It is only the report of the committee of fifteen, to 
be sure, that treats directly of your question; and the council has accordingly asked. 
me to say to you a few words about that, particularly with reference to the very 
lively discussion which its exposition of principles has provoked. Still, as our State 
council committee has conjoined with this report of the fifteen the report of the ten— 
doubtless because some principles in the latter, though laid down for secondary 
schools, are felt to be of great importance for elementary schools as well—it will be 
natural and proper for me, in what I say, to bring out something of the relations 
subsisting between the two reports, noticing particularly certain marked differ- 
ences between them. 
By way of préliminary, it is worth saying that the report of the committee of 
fifteen really contains three distinct reports on three very distinct subjects con- 
nected with elementary schools, the committee having been divided for this purpose 
into three sections of five members each; so that it is only with the second of these 
sections that we are really concerned this morning—the section whose report deals 
with the correlation of elementary studies. We are consequently to consider not 
the views of fifteen, but only of five committeemen. For the sake of a brief and 
convenient style of citation, then, I shall refer to these two great reports, during the 
rest of my remarks, as the report of the ten and the report of the five. 
Strongly as these two reports resemble each other in their exceptional ability, 
there is nothing more striking about them than the different, yes, the contrasted 
fates with which they have thus far met. The report of the ten has been hailed 
with an acclaim so nearly universal that the few dissenting voices are practically 
drowned in the wave of approval; but the report of the five seems in some danger 
of having its voice overwhelmed in the clamor of dissent which it has roused. The 
reasons for this great contrast of fates attending two performances so akin in pre- 
eminent merit are not merely a matter for our curious interest, but are an imperative 
object of our inquiry, if we would be true to the heart of great educational dis- 
cussions. Accordingly, though it will be impossible to do any full justice to the 
subject in the few minutes at our disposal, I will endeavor to show, in a brief and 
imperfect way, what the main causes are that have brought this: great difference 
about. 
Notable of both the reports is the fact that each is dominated by the influence of one 
mind—that of the chairman of the committee in charge of it; and this to a degree quite 
unusual in such cases. So that, in effect, we have in these two reports the expression 
of the minds of two men of profoundly differing types; the two, in fact, who by a 
1 Address before the California Teachers’ Association, at its meeting held in Oakland in January, 
1896.
-P-A-G-E-1011
  CORRELATION OF STUDIES. 935 
silent general consent have now for years been acknowledged as in their respective 
kinds unquestionably the leaders of our American education. In the report of the 
ten, we have the mind of the president of Harvard University; and not only upon 
the matter of an orderly and sound curriculum for secondary schools, but implicitly _ 
upon the far profounder matter of the determining principle for the whole scheme 
of a people’s education. In the report of the five, we have the mind of the United 
States Commissioner of Education; and he, too, in setting forth the principles deter- 
mining the right correlation of studies for elementary schools, finds his occasion, and 
indeed the necessity, to give us explicitly his full mind upon the principles that 
should determine all selection and all correlation of all studies, if education is to be 
sound; and he takes such a course in this great matter as to make his mind upon it 
appear as if it were the mind of mankind itself thereon. For his chief argument is 
that the safety of the human kind as an historical whole is what is in issue in the 
question of correlating studies, and that the all-controlling principle in a right cor- 
relation is the due selection and apportioning of studies in the light of their bearing 
on the historic integrity of the human race, and on the integrity of each child asa 
member in a whole that is to be historically continuous, and genuinely because his- 
torically progressive. What really makes these two reports so interesting and so 
significant is the conflict latent in them between these two marked personalities. 
We can read in this the deeper conflict of two great types of personality—two types 
of human aim and purpose; two contending views, in fact, upon the meaning, the 
explanation, and the direction of life; in short, the conflict of two philosophies. 
The gist of the difference between these two philosophies, and consequently 
between the two reports, is the different value which they place (1) upon the native 
tendencies of each particular human being that lead him away from a fixed common 
type of mankind, and (2) upon that universal or rational type. The one proceeds 
upon the view that each peculiar and individual expression of the common human 
nature is the one fact of truly cardinal value; the other, upon the view that the 
supreme consideration must be the type characteristically human—not private and 
peculiar, but public, generic, and, above all, historic. The one fills its eye with the 
single human being and his peculiar whole of personal endowment, in no other 
exactly repeated, and incapable of being replaced by anything but itself; the other, 
with the imposing whole of the universal rational nature, in comparison with which 
individual variations seem trivial, and which appears clothed with the authority 
and majesty of history, and with the incomparable warrant of a public judgment 
that has borne the test of time, of experience, of the long conflict of considerate 
reflection and experience-sobered forethought with the complex and adverse cir- 
cumstances amid which the race has had to mature. The one therefore finds the 
chief motives of educational aims and methods in the interests of the single pupil; 
the other, in the rational authority of the human type, historically developed and 
tested and warranted. The watchword of the one will be that word now heard so 
constantly from almost every quarter, the word so naturally dear to every modern 
heart, the word so attractive, so fascinating, the kindling word “interest ;” the watch- 
word of the other, that word which, if often forgotten amid the whirl of contending 
and confusing interests, is still the word that wakes the deepest chords in the human 
soul whenever it is heard, the commanding word ‘ duty,” the bracing word “charac- 
ter,” the invigorating phrase ‘‘a reasonable life.” Everywhere the one philosophy, 
and accordingly the one report, echoes to the theme of election in education, the great- 
est possible range of free choice by the individual student as to what he will study, 
guided by what he finds answering to his native interest in subjects; everywhere the 
other, to the theme of a rational system of subjects for study, which is held to 
express the universal reason of mankind in its several essential aspects, and which 
must enter into every scheme of education that can claim to be truly human, in the 
sense of being genuinely reasonable. Thus the one philosophy, with its accordant 
report, finds the master principle of education in personal native impulse, in personal 
desire; the other finds it in a public or generic intelligent judgment, that gets at 
 
-P-A-G-E-1012
936 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
  the abiding heart of human nature with all the mass and momentum of history, in a 
universal rational will which is to judge, to master, and to use all merely private 
desires. Consequently, the report of the ten appeals directly to the foremost ten- 
dencies of the times, the present mood of the Zeitgeist, and naturally finds a corre- 
sponding response. But the report of the five has to stem the prevailing current; 
indeed, has to turn it from its course; and it not only invites the prevalent thought 
to an unrelished self-criticism, but it demands as the effective means of this a much 
subtler and deeper order of thinking than the habitual flow of consciousness finds 
easy. This largely accounts, as it seems to me, for the present greater success of 
the report of the committee of ten; but it also foretells, as I believe, the profounder 
coming acceptance of the report of the five, an acceptance that may be slow in 
maturing, and that will no doubt be attended with corrective criticism of details, 
but that will be all the more settled and secure. 
Another reason for the difference in fate of the two reports, is undoubtedly to be 
found in the different methods by which they are respectively supplied with evidence 
to convince and to influence those to whom they are addressed. This difference of 
methods is, in part, ingrained in the very difference of view and aim which we have 
just considered; but itis, in perhaps greater part, also owing to the characteristic 
powers of their two authors. Without the least disparagement of either, I think 
we may truly say that if the author of the first has a genius for administration, the 
author of the other has a genius for thought, for penetrating to first principles and 
to fundamental reasons. Thus the report of the ten, instead of arguing, proceeds, 
with the genuine administrative instinct, directly to the established sources of 
administrative authority, and, selecting approved representatives of the staff 
actually engaged in managing and teaching secondary schools, obtains their opin- 
ions, justly reckoned weighty, on the several questions raised. These are colligated, 
judiciously sifted, adjusted, most skillfully harmonized; and the condensed result— 
briefly, pertinently, and forcibly set forth—carries with it, naturally, all the convine- 
ing weight that judgment already accepted and taken for granted must always have, 
and must have in the highest degree when there is confidence in the process by 
which its adequate representatives have been selected, and confidence in the adminis- 
trative capacity of the man who selects them. Far different from this simple appeal 
to what the public directly concerned has already definitely settled, and this master- 
ful avoidance of inquiries that may unsettle everything, and must unavoidably 
unsettle much, and stir up the more or less violent dispute that inevitably attends 
all starting of real questions—far different from this is the problem of the man who 
will inquire into the final reasons of things; who can not find it in him to admit that 
what either individuals or communities, either personal instincts or gradually 
acquired customs and habits of feeling, merely want to have or to do is what in 
reason they ought to have and to do, but is drawn onward by a high conviction that 
there is a discoverable reason, an ideal justification, for everything that is worth 
man’s while to do or tohave. The report of the five inquires into the chief problem 
of education in this spirit of deep and truly sober speculation. It opens matters to 
- the bottom, and stirs them up from their depths. Its direct appeal to the ultimate 
reason in the case, its appeal from mere fact and actual practice to ideal considera- 
tions, may be in the best sense stimulating; but it carries with it the unavoidable 
consequence that the judgments of its readers, once invited and aroused, will surely 
be diverse, will be strongly so at first, and will require a process more or less tedious, 
a lapse of time possibly long, in order to come to a settled harmony. 
Accordingly, the author of this report has found himself—very likely without 
surprise—confronted with a keen opposition to his main positions, and that, too, from 
the very class of minds among our school managers that may well claim to rank 
among the most intelligently alert. There are three main lines of objection which 
they follow in criticising the report. 
The first of these is that its author’s view on correlation of studies misses the 
teal aim entirely; his scheme, they say, is not correlation in the true sense of the
-P-A-G-E-1013
   
CORRELATION OF STUDIES. 937 
word at all. His system should be called, rather, a system for the selection and 
valuation of studies; a system of their coordination instead of their correlation. 
Correlation, they will have it, means the bringing of the subjects of study into a 
closer unity than that of coordination; it means that they shall be brought into a 
unity of subordination, and that some subject, or rather some principle of dealing 
with all subjects, needs to be found that will serve to reduce each to its proper place 
and function as an auxiliary of greater or less subordination in the process of real 
education. It must settle which of them is really principal and substantive, and 
which merely subsidiary and instrumental. The report, they claim, has only begun 
the work assigned to its committee; or worse, it has built up a barrier in the way of 
the work, by suddenly arresting the investigation when it has settled upon the 
several studies that legitimately belong in an elementary curriculum, and then 
obstinately insisting that this shall be taken as the only problem, and its result as 
the only true meaning of correlation. 
This brings them to their second line of objection. What they really mean is, that 
correlation, taken in the sense of a unification by subordination, has its secret in the 
recognition that mind, the development and right discipline of which is the business 
of education, carries in its very being as self-conscious intelligenco a distinction 
between consciousness as substantive contents and consciousness as mere form—mere 
way of putting or stating those contents. All the interest of mental being lies in 
the contents, they say, and none of it at all, or next to none of it, is the mere form. 
Thus this distinction between knowledge of contents and knowledge of mere form 
is the distinction, they claim, between the knowledge that alone is substantive and 
real and the knowledge that is merely nominal. The form apart from the contents 
is unreal, hollow, meaningless, insignificant. There is in it no interest, except fora 
few unusual minds, who, whatever their remote usefulness as makers and polishers of 
instruments for real intelligences, are themselves hardly human, are a sort of gnomes 
that live in the underground Diimmerung and are by nature repellent dryasdusts. 
The application of this vital distinction between form and contents to the question 
of correlation, say these critics of Dr. Harris, would settle a main practical question 
in elementary education at once. It would explain why the children in elementary — 
schools do not flourish as they ought; it would show that they are perishing from an 
unsucculent diet of the three R’s—from a lack of the proper nourishment to be 
found only in interesting contents, and a vain attempt to feed minds on the empty 
husks of the merely formal consciousness. For, cry these Herbartian philosophers, 
what is Reading, ’Riting, or ’Rithmetic, but just the form of thought and reality, 
pure and simple, form torn off from its proper contents, and in itself destitute of 
any human interest or meaning? Nature and man, natural science, history, poetry, 
these alone furnish the mind with contents. What wonder that the school children 
do not care, except rarely, for learning to read and write and cipher, when it is plain 
that not one of these things gives them any interesting contents, any savory pabu- 
lum at all, but instead only forces on them the juiceless cud of empty form? These 
things, no doubt, have to enter into the work of elementary education, but they 
should only play a minor and a servant’s part there, just as the mechanic’s tools are 
indispensable to his work, but after all are nothing but tools, and would lodge him 
on the summit of absurdity if he spent his time in making them and keeping them 
in order. .The demand paramount, say these critics, is to correlate these formal 
studies into their proper place of humble service and instrumentality, and to teach 
them by means of interesting contents to which they are applied. All the threo R’s 
should be taught incidentally merely, as need for them actually comes up in the 
course of learning by the help of the senses the interesting things of science, history, 
and poetry. 
At this point the third line of objection from these critics comes into plain view, 
the real and basal line. They claim that Dr. Harris makes no proper provision for 
interest—that he ignores or belittles the absolute mainspring of fruitful education, 
ED 96. 30*  
-P-A-G-E-1014
938 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-96. 
which is that whatever a pupil studies shail interest him. Dr. Harris, his critics 
maintain, would bring all pupils, every one of whom is an unreplaceable original, 
with desires, powers, and interests all his own, having in themselves mandatory 
rights, the satisfaction and preservation of which ought to be the devout study and 
persistent business of every teacher—Dr. Harris would bring them all under the Pro- 
crustean forms of a publie and undiscriminating tradition, a tradition, too, that 
commits the fatal oversight of rating formal and implemental studies even higher 
than studies of contents and substance, and that ignores the plain truth, no longer 
to be blinked, that human beings are not all cast in the same mold, but are made in 
every variety of nature, with interests endlessly varying; a tradition, finally, that 
knows nothing of the central fact that the entire life of humanity turns upon interest, 
which is at once its spring, its inspiration, and its hope. 
But in this doctrine of interest—this absolute justification of the human natural 
self as a product of birth and heredity—Dr. Harris hears the knell of civilization. 
The secret of that, surely, whatever it may be, is of somewhat higher import than 
the satisfaction of merely individual instinets, qualifications, and desires. And just 
as surely, it can not lie directly in those private desires, can not be made out of end- 
less variation, isolation, difference. Nor can the great thing we mean by character, 
which assuredly is the true goal of all education, be built out of mere instincts and 
desires and the perpetual consultation of these, and the persistent cultivation of 
them. What must become of rational freedom, of all that goes to make real man- 
hood and real womanhood, if the culture of each person is to be studied and guided 
wholly from the point of view of the natural interests, the private personal desires, 
of each? = 
Well, there is the issue between Dr. Harris and his erities—the issue between inter- 
est and character. On which side of it are you? I shall undertake no decision of it 
now, though I admit that my sympathies are mainly with the view of our distin- 
guished Commissioner of Education. Next year I shall hope to bear some part in 
the discussion of this question that is to come at our meeting in San Jose, and then 
Ishall be glad to go into the core of the subject on its merits. For the present, I 
must content myself with having thus briefly told you what I suppose the real ques- 
tion is, and with the further statement that, in my opinion, there can never be any 
satisfactory solution of the many problems connected with elementary education 
until we find the means of separating the elementary school, in accordance with its 
true philosophical definition, from the various forms of the secondary school, and of 
causing secondary education to begin, as it should, at a much earlier date than at 
present, somewhere near the beginning of the present so-called sixth grade of the 
grammar school. To this end, we need most of all to attain a philosophical dis- 
tinction between the elementary school and secondary schools, and to supplant by 
this our present meaningless and futile distinction, which knows no difference 
between them but the shallow fact that the one comes first and the other comes 
second. 
Let me close by saying that I would not for a moment be supposed to deny the 
educational value of interest. -Nor would I be thought to imply that Dr. Harris 
overlooks this; he only sees that there is something still more valuable. Interest 
is indispensable to successful education; you can not teach the uninterested mind. 
But it is the very business of the teachor, and the very genius of the true teacher, 
to kindle interest; to know what is reasonable, what is for the highest good of the 
pupil, and to be able to rouse his interest in that, even when he has no interest in it 
by nature.

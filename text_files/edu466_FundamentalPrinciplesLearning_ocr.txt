  PREFACE 
The present volume is a rewriting of manuscript which the 
writer has used for some time as part of his lectures to stu- 
dents in educational psychology. The aim is especially to show 
how the results of general psychology and experimental psy- 
chology and of allied sciences can be put into use by the teacher 
and the student in the problems of learning and of study. In 
the chapters on Making the Appeal to the Student, and Atten- 
tion and Sustained Effort, examples have been given from 
the writer’s own studies and observations for the purpose of 
illustrating psychological principles involved and to suggest to 
teachers ways that have proved successful in the actual everyday 
work of the teacher. 
The writer thinks that The Habit Theory has not received 
its due in educational practice and perhaps not in educational 
thought. It is a principle which runs through the whole work 
of education and the adoption of it as the fundamental work- 
ing principle of the teacher’s work should help to bring the 
definiteness that is needed. If habits, including habitudes, 
dispositions and attitudes, are not all the results that education 
can show, we can see what is left out after we do our duty to 
the first and fundamental things. 
The general scheme of the book can be indicated by the fol- 
lowing statement of some of the main thoughts: (1) The nature 
of education and of the educational process from the point of 
view of permanent results in the individual. (2) The necessity 
for permanent results of some kind and the nature of these 
results. (3) The process of learning, of making acquisitions 
which can be made more or less permanent and suggestions 
for the right direction of this learning process. (4) A discus- 
sion of how to make the best progress in learning. (5) The 
getting of not only specific but general improvement. (6) The 
factors that make for permanent results. (7) Modes of appeal 
for the purpose of arousing and directing the desired activities. 
(8) The development through lower to higher stages of attention, 
7

activity, and effort. (9) The development of the emotional and 
moral nature for permanent results in moral character. (10) 
Physical and physiological conditions that are involved in learn- 
ing and study. (11) The problem of how to study, teaching to 
study, and of putting supervised study into the school. (12) 
The need for definite ends of education and the possibility of 
using the principles and facts presented herein to help towards 
greater definiteness of aim, of procedure and of obtaining recog- 
nizable and measurable end results so that the work of education 
shall approach in definiteness the achievement of other big 
business enterprises. 
References at the ends of chapters indicate books and articles 
that seem to the author to be most useful to the teacher if he 
wishes to choose from a large number of possible references. 
Others may be equally good, but a selected bibliography seems 
to be most valuable. 
It is my pleasure and duty to acknowledge the helpful criti- 
cisms and suggestions of Dean L. D. Coffman, Professor N. 
Wilde, Professor H. H. Woodrow, Professor J. Peterson, and 
Mr. J. R. Kantor, of The University of Minnesota and of Pro- 
fessor H. W. Odum, of The University of Georgia.

PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION 
  The first edition of this book was in every sense of the word a 
war product. The author finished his work hastily before enter- 
ing the army, and the publisher suffered many difficulties, espe- 
cially, the loss of one printer after another after the publication 
was under way. Although the pressure of other duties does not 
give time for all the revision that the author would like, never- 
theless, there has been opportunity for a somewhat better 
organization of material, omission of some slight repetition, 
the addition of chapters relating particularly to the higher type 
of education, and of paragraphs that it is hoped add clarity and 
definiteness to the entire subject and at the same time bring the 
the discussions into line with recent developments of thought. 
New references have been added. 
It is perhaps not inappropriate to add a word of thanks for 
the favorable criticisms that have been made of the book by 
reviewers and for the expressions of appreciation that have been 
made to the author by both teachers and students. 
I wish especially to express my appreciation of suggestions and 
criticisms made by my colleague, Professor Geo. A. Hutchinson, 
of this University.

  Fundamental Principles of 
Learning and Study 
PART 1: HABIT AND EDUCATION 
CHAPTER 1 
THE NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF HABIT 
Habit and Daily Life-—The accomplished adult who rises in 
the morning, dresses, eats breakfast and in a short time finds 
himself quickly and easily disposing of item after item of his daily 
work is but a single example of one of the most marvelous things 
of life. We are accustomed to these things and do not consider 
them as marvelous. The wonders of the world so-called are 
great structures, pyramids, bridges, hanging gardens, radio, and 
the like. These are all wonderful but they are only productions 
of the mind of man. Man who can produce them is the real 
marvel. - 
At first he could not dress himself; but now he dresses with 
hardly a thought about his clothes dnd is already thinking of the 
problems of the day. At first he was unable to handle the fork, 
knife, and spoon; but now he enters into conversation and per- 
haps glances at the morning paper as he despatches the morning 
meal. At first he was unable to make himself intelligible to 
others or to solve any problems; now he speaks easily or turns 
to the typewriter, and with hardly a thought about the typing, 
dashes off a letter with his thoughts upon the composition and its 
probable effect upon the reader. The problems that at first were 
difficult and required much consideration, now find prompt and 
accurate solution. New problems must, indeed, require much 
of the strain of attention and reasoning that was present at an 
earlier period, but these are solved more quickly and easily, and 
once solved form the basis for still quicker and more accurate 
decision when a similar situaticn again arises.

14 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
During the hours not taken up with business or professional 
work the mature individual turns to some of his permanent 
interests: favorite authors, or musical selections; old friends and 
pastimes; a customary walk among the hills or the old arm chair 
by the fire. 
Features of Established Habits.—If now we consider the 
features of established habits we find that they act with regular- 
ity and after the nature of the mechanical and the instinctive; 
that they carry with them a desire or proneness for the activity 
that has developed into the habitual; that they tend to act with 
slighter and slighter stimulation and even in the face of obstacles; 
that they act with relative independence of attention and thought 
and become more and more automatic; that they not only reen- 
“force original nature and enrich it, but that they may even 
overcome original nature and act quite at variance with it; that 
there is increasing accuracy, promptness and ease of action; and 
that attention and thought are relieved to consider new problems 
and to make acquisition of new dispositions and tendencies. 
Our mature individual, who is now able to accomplish what he 
could not do at the outset, appears to be the product not merely 
of his perceiving, thinking, etc., but of his habits, of the per- 
manent dispositions and tendencies, that have developed within 
him and have given him stability, accuracy, ease, interests, 
character. 
Habit in Psychological Literature.—The literature of psy- 
chology is rich in the indication of the various kinds of habits 
and of the extensiveness of habituation in the human organism. 
Woodworth!” in his Psychology speaks of “habits of attention” 
and of “inattention,” of ‘profanity, free spending, erect car- 
riage,” and “language habits” and of the bad habit of grouchi- 
ness;”’ “a loosely organized instinct may become, through the 
individual’s experience, a closely organized habit;” and, ‘even 
children . . . are ‘little creatures of habits.’”’ 
Stout writes of ‘habitual action as when one knits, or plays a 
musical instrument;” ‘‘fencing;” “habits of thought and will” 
as when one “answers letters on the day on which they are 
received,” and the habit of ‘making puns.” 
All psychomatic functions are “immeasurably facilitated by 
the consolidations, extensions and ellipses which experience 
gradually acquires under habituation,’ writes Bentley and 
the pages of Titchener'** teem with references to habit.
-P-A-G-E-15
  
  NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF HABIT 15 
Andrews” explains that both specific and general habits 
“find illustration in the ‘professional mind.’ On the one hand, 
the mental processes corresponding to the facts of the profession, 
e.g. law, are at the instant service of consciousness, so strong are 
the habitual tendencies favoring their re-experience. These are 
specific habits. On the other hand, the continued experiencing 
of the mass of related processes, which form the mental side of a 
profession like law, develops general mental habits in accord with 
these experiences. The lawyer’s thought shows the impress of 
these habits; it follows legal logic.” The specific habits “func- 
tion in memory, imagination, thought, bodily movement, etc., 
in which specific processes experienced in the past, reappear in 
consciousness.” The general habits “function in habits of 
thought, attitude and volition in which novel processes of the © 
present are shaped in accord with the experiences of the past.’’ 
Sully on Habit.—Writing on habit, Prof. Sully tells us that: 
“The dependence of. mental development on cerebral changes 
is illustrated in a peculiar way in the phenomena of habit. By 
the term habit is meant the transformation of once fully con- 
scious mental processes into semi-conscious or automatic actions, 
as in the practised actions of walking, writing, and so forth. This 
result depends, it is evident, on the perfect co-ordination of 
certain central elements. As a result of such perfect ‘organi- 
zation” of psychical actions nervous energy is liberated for the 
building up of new formations.%* 
“Development and Habit.—Mental development implies not 
merely an advance from lower to higher psychical forms, but 
a growing rapidity and facility in all recurring or repeated 
processes. This result, already touched on in connection with 
organic development, is an extension of the psycho-physical 
attribute, retentiveness. We carry out accustomed acts of percep- 
tion, as in recognizing a person, customary trains of ideas, as in 
learning a series of historical events, and habitual actions, as in 
swimming or skating, more and more rapidly, and with less and less 
strain of attention, just because of the organization of the traces 
of previous like actions. So far as this organization comes in, 
the conscious element grows weaker, and tends to lapse. To 
this extent habit would seem to imply no psychical but only 
nervous development. 
“This dropping out of the conscious factor as the consequence 
of repeated exercise and of habit is, however, only one part of
-P-A-G-E-16
ne 
16 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
the result. The tendency of repeated psycho-physical processes 
to become automatic and unconscious sets free the activity of 
attention for further processes of psychical acquisition and 
growth. Indeed, it is only by this economising of attention or 
consciousness in the case of habitual processes that the. more com- 
plicated psychical processes become possible. Thus it is by learn- 
ing to recognise first words, and then groups of words, swiftly 
and automatically, that we are able to carry out the difficult, 
complex intellectual processes of reading.” 
Two Meanings of Habit.—‘‘ Habit, as we shall see, has a nar- 
rower and a wider meaning. When it refers to the rigid fix- 
ing of ideas or actions in one definite order it is a force that 
opposes development.” ‘Habitual action or grouping of ideas 
means action or grouping which is altered with difficulty. This 
is seen in the case of the uneducated mind, which is narrow and 
rigid, just because it has formed certain fixed modes of associat- 
ing ideas through which it cannot break. But taken in a larger 
sense, as including all the effect of repetition of psychical processes, 
habit is an integral factor in the processes of development itself; 
for it is only by retaining the traces of our past activity that we can 
render this activity more perfect.’’97 
“We are best fitted to cope with our life-surroundings when 
we are able on the one hand to carry out all recurring uniform 
modes of responsive action easily, simply and automatically, 
and at the same time to bring to bear a highly evolved reflective 
consciousness on new, difficult, and complex problems of life.’’** 
Writing on habit, Prof. Angell says: ‘The whole course of 
mental development could truly enough be described as made 
up of this process of acquiring habits, which once imbedded in 
the tissues of the nervous system become the permanent possession 
of the individual, ready, when need arises, to step in and deal 
with the necessities of any particular situation . . . Neural 
habit . . . is not only the great emancipator of consciousness 
from the necessities of endless control over the same trivial 
round of acts, it is the great tool by which that feature of mind 
which we call the will executes its behests and renders our mental 
decisions and choices effective in the world of action. Without 
habits consciousness could never get beyond the borders of the 
inevitable daily routine. With habit, however, it is able to 
pass from victory to victory, leaving behind in captivity the 
special coordinations it needs.”’*
-P-A-G-E-17
    NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF HABIT 17 
The Formation of Habits.—‘‘It shall be our next business to 
trace in outline the process by which consciousness and the 
brain bring order out of . . . threatened chaos and leave the 
organism a group of habits to which additions are continually 
made and by means of which the organism becomes increas- 
ingly master of the situation. This account will be only a sketch, 
however, for all the rest of our study will be devoted to filling 
in the details. In the chapters upon volition we shall return 
specifically to these very points.’’4 
Passing over these pages which give the details mentioned, but 
to the most important of which the writer gives page references, 
if the reader cares to look them up, we come to Angell’s conclud- 
ing statements: ‘‘When we bring all our considerations together 
it becomes obvious that the proposition from which we set out 
early in our work is true in'a very wide and deep sense. Mind 
we have found to be, indeed, an engine for accomplishing the most 
remarkable adjustments of the organism to its life conditions. 
We have seen how the various features of cognitive and affective 
consciousness contribute each its quota to the general efficiency 
of the reactions which the organism is able to make upon its 
surroundings, physical and social . . . we have discovered 
volition concerned with impulses, with pleasure and pain, with 
emotion, with ideas, with sensations, with memory, with reason- 
ing, and with every form and type of mental operation. We 
have observed the evolving control beginning with the mere 
mastery of movements, passing from this to more and more 
remote ends, for the attainment of which the previously mastered 
movements now available as habitual coordinations are employed, 
until finally we find the mind setting up for itself the ideas which 
we call ideals, and by means of these shaping the whole course of 
a lifetime.’’® 
Habit is Fundamental for the Most Complete Kind of Think- 
ing.—Any kind of thinking whatever appears to be dependent 
upon just this elementary law of habit. ‘‘I shall try to show, in 
the pages which immediately follow,” writes James, ‘‘that there 
is no other elementary causal law of association than the law 
of neural habit. All the materials of our thought are due to the 
way in which one elementary process of the cerebral hemispheres 
tends to excite whatever other elementary process it may have 
excited at some former time. The number of elementary proc- 
esses at work, however, and the nature of those which at any 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
    
  18 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
time are fully effective in rousing the others, determine the char- _ 
acter of the total brain-action, and, as a consequence of this, — 
they determine the object thought of at the time. According 
as this resultant object is one thing or another, we call it a prod- 
uct of association by contiguity or of association by similarity, 
or contrast, or whatever other sorts we may have recognized as 
ultimate. Its production, however, is, in each one of these 
cases, to. be explained by a merely quantitatve variation in the 
elementary brain-processés momentarily at work under the 
law of habit, so that psychic contiguity, similarity, etc., are deriva- 
tives of a single profownder fact.”*> . . . “From the guessing 
of newspaper engimas to the plotting of the policy of an empire 
there is no other process than this. We trust to the laws of cerebral 
nature to present us spontaneously with the appropriate idea.”** 
“The way to a deeper understanding of the order of our 
ideas lies in the direction of cerebral physiology. The ele- 
mentary process of revival can be nothing but the law of habit.” 
«. . But even though there be a mental spontaneity, it can 
certainly not create ideas or summon them ex abrupto. Its 
power is limited to selecting amongst those which the associative 
machinery has already introduced or tends to introduce.’’” 
Habit and Plasticity.—Sully tells us, ‘It is evident from our 
account of habit that it is essentially a process of fixation, a 
restriction of movement to definite lines. Habitual actions, just 
because they become sub-conscious and largely non-voluntary, 
are rendered stable and unalterable. Habit thus presents one 
aspect which is opposed to all that we understand by develop- 
ment or progress. Itself the product of development, it tends 
in its turn to obstruct to some extent further development. 
We see this in the difficulty the tyro at the oars encounters in 
turning his boat, rowing with the one arm and backing water 
with the other; and in the common failure of stout resolve to 
break through noxious habits. i 
“While, however, in its narrower and more rigid form, habit 
diminishes the plasticity of the neuro-muscular apparatus, it 
would be an error to suppose that it is wholly an obstacle to 
progress. This would overlook the range of the principle, its 
influence in cases where action falls far short of the automatic 
stage, and also misunderstand the nature of motor development. 
What we call new movements are never wholly new, and, as 
pointed out above, the perfect mastery of particular movements
-P-A-G-E-19
    
NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF HABIT 19 
always helps us to the mastery of others. Thus the movements 
of equilibration and locomotion in skating are, as every learner 
knows, greatly furthered by previously acquired and habitual 
movements. The learning here consists in a few and compara- 
tively slight modifications of old combinations in particular 
directions; and though the modifications may be difficult through 
the obstructive force of the previous coordinations, they are a 
far less difficult operation than would be the learning of the whole 
group of movements de novo.”’®? 
Habit a Universal Principle.—It is not inappropriate to indi- 
cate that this principle of habit, or the tendency for repetition, 
has very wide application in various fields. 
The logician tells us that ‘Induction is only possible on the 
assumption that things not only are together but belong together. 
. the universal nature of a thing cannot be discovered in 
the form of some essence or substance that remains perma- 
nent and unchanging . . . it must be defined through the 
constancy of behavior shown in its changing relations to its 
environment.’ 
But even more, the finding of things happening again as they 
have happened before under the same conditions is at the very 
bottom of our thinking and a necessary basis of all reasoning. 
According to Pearson, ‘‘Anything, be it noted, that tends to 
weaken our confidence in the uniform order of phenomena, in 
what we have termed the routine of perceptions, tends also to 
stultify our reasoning faculty by destroying the sole basis of our 
knowledge.’’7® 
Jevons asserts that ‘It must be the ground of all reasoning 
and inference that what is true of one thing will be true of its 
equivalent, and that under carefully ascertained conditions, 
Nature repeats herself.”’*® ‘We must always rise to something 
which is general or same in the cases (of induction), and assuming 
that sameness to be extended to new cases we learn their nature. 
Hearing a clock tick five thousand times without exception or 
variation, we adopt the very probable hypothesis that there is 
some invariably active machine which produces those uniform 
sounds, and which will, in the absence of change, go on produc- 
ing them.’’4® 
On what else can prediction in any science be based than on 
the assumption that what nature has done before under certain 
condition, will be done again under those conditions? ‘Every
-P-A-G-E-20
20° FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
  law of nature is the statement of a certain uniformity observed 
to exist among phenomena, and since the laws of nature are 
invariably obeyed, it seems to follow that the course of nature 
itself is uniform, so that we can safely judge of the future by the 
present. ‘This inference is supported by some of the results of 
physical astronomy.’’!7 
Habit and the Social Sciences.—Or let us turn to history. We 
are all accustomed to the phrase that “history repeats itself.” 
The orders and speeches of Napoleon to his troops are seemingly 
repeated in the present speeches and messages of the Kaiser to his 
troops. The French denunciation of the English one hundred 
years ago appears today in the German denunciation of the Eng- 
lish. The. treaty of Utrecht and the reapportioning of Europe 
among the powers, (1713-14), finds its counterpart in the Con- 
gress of Vienna and another reapportioning of Europe, (1815). 
We may ask, will this analog of habit appear the same as before? 
The present war completes part of the repetition of events. Will 
the reapportioning of Europe again recur? (Note: This was 
written in 1917.) 
Biology furnishes analogs. Spencer writes: “A species of 
plant that has been transformed from one soil or climate to 
another, frequently undergoes what botanists call ‘a change of 
habit.’ ’’? 
In the field of social physology McDougall tells us, “In short, 
the formation of habits by the individuals of each generation 
is an essential condition of the perpetuation of custom, and 
custom is the principle condition of all social organization.’’®* 
Ross, in his Social Psychology, also shows the working of this 
fundamental law.*” 
Sumner in his excellent work in social science takes us again 
tohabit. In the preface he says: “‘ The thesis which is expounded 
in these chapters (chs. 1 and 2) is: that the folkways are habits of 
the individual and customs of the society which arise from efforts 
to satisify needs,” etc.%* 
In his Laws of Imitation, Tarde’ writes: ‘Repetition exists, 
then, for the sake of variation.” ‘‘Science, as I have said, deals 
only with quantities and growths, or in more general terms, with 
the resemblances and repetitions of phenomena . . . Every 
advance of knowledge tends to strengthen the conviction that 
all resemblance is due to repetition.” ‘In the distant future all 
social phenomena will be reducible to mathematical formula.”
-P-A-G-E-21
  NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF HABIT 21 
“. . 2 every civilization is fated to . . . begin its 
endlesd cycle over again.” ‘Everything repeats itself, and 
nothing persists.” . . . “Tradition and custom, the conserva- 
tive forms of ations have been fixing and perpetuating its 
new acquisitions and consolidating its increments in the heart 
of every class of people that has been raised up through the 
example of higher classes or of more civilized neighbors.” 
Ellwood, summarizing the studies of the classicists in social 
theory, says that, ‘‘Law in the social sciences, then, rests upon 
the fact of habit . . . A social law is a statement of the habitual 
way in which individuals, or groups of individuals, interact.’’?® 
In the realm of philosophy we find Taylor telling us that “We 
should . . . have to think of the ‘laws’ or ‘uniformities’ in 
physical nature as corresponding to the habitual modes of 
reaction of the sentient beings . . . Habit and spontaneity 
would mutually imply each other in nature at large.’’107 
The Varying Strengths of Habits.—Using habit as we have 
broadly defined it, that is, as more or less permanent dispositions 
or tendencies, we find tendencies of various strengths. Language 
supplies us with terms which express some of these degress, as 
for example, inclination, desire, bent, bias, leaning, attitude, 
disposition, predisposition, mood, passion, craving, automatism. 
Habits are of all degrees of strength. We may, perhaps, for 
practical purposes distinguish five degrees: (1) There are the 
strongest habits which we may call automatic or reflex. These 
are habits that tend to act invariably on the appropriate stimulus. 
They include tendencies that were inborn and have been often 
repeated, and tendencies that were acquired early in life which 
have also had much repetition. Things learned later in life may 
approach this degree of automatism, but rarely if ever reach it. 
Habits formed in a strict military school during four years and 
repeated daily throughout that period might furnish examples of 
this order. These are quite fully second nature, so to speak. 
(2) Well established habits of adult life, such as professional 
habits, ways of doing things, ways of looking at things, affective 
responses of the artist, and the like. (8) The fairly well formed 
habits of life, such as the things that are pretty well learned in 
school and college, things that we recall but not perfectly, activi- 
ties that we can perform, but which need considerable practice 
before they are prompt and sure. (4) The dispositions that 
may or may not act upon the proper occasion, that depend upon  
-P-A-G-E-22
    22 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
recency of practice and mood, and the number of obstacles or 
inhibitions that arise to hinder them. (5) The weakest tenden- 
cies which have relatively little effect on the individual, and 
which tend to die out in a very short time and leave but the 
faintest trace. The faintest impression probably leaves some 
effect upon the nervous system, although it may be so little 
that for practical purposes it can be ignored. 
Kinds of Habits.—Finally we may indicate in general sum- 
mary some of the most important kinds of habits. 
I. Intellectual. ; 
1. Habits of observing carefully and accurately. 
2. Habits of clear and accurate association and recall; 
memorial habits, or memories. 
3. Habits of forming new concepts and of refining and 
correcting old ones. 
4. Habits of making clear, accurate, logical judgments. 
5. Habits of thinking over, meditating upon, rehearsing, 
and thinking out old ideas and conclusions, from new 
points of view, for productive thought, 7. e., originality. 
6. Habits of good attention. 
II. Emotional. 
1. Permanent interests, in science, literature, art, gov-

2. Emotional attitudes, desires, and the like, which may 
develop into such things as, logical sentiments or desire 
for truth, ethical sentiments or desire for the highest 
good, aesthetic sentiments or desire for the beautiful, 
religious sentiments. Dislikes on the other hand, for 
things, that are unworthy, immoral, etc. Under this 
head we may include “habitudes.”’

writing, handling apparatus, using tools, ete. 
Generalized Habits and the Habit of Generalizing and Apply- 
ing.—Habits are both specific and general. The habits men- 
tioned above must be acquired in connection with certain 
activities and result in the easier, more economical doing of the
-P-A-G-E-23
  NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF HABIT 23 
things learned. But habits may be generalized or general; that 
is, they may act from the arousal of different stimuli than those 
which originally aroused them, or they may act under the domi- 
nance of different emotional states. There may also be the habit 
of applying what is learned, of trying to make it help in other 
fields“than.that-in which the habit was acquired. These may 
include the results of education which are called “transfers of 
training,” and it is possible that all transfers may be reduced to 
the transfer of habits, under favorable conditions, e. g., presence 
of ideals, realizations of value, desire and attempt to make 
applications,-etc. In other words, transfer of training, which 
refers-to-improyement in one activity which is-correlated..with 
improvement in another or other-activities; may at bottom be 
habits-learned. in one situation which~are~set.into~action” by 
stimuli.different from those which originally started the habit. 
We commonly think of Habits as specific; and’so hundreds and 
thousands of them are, such as the specific responses of the 
individual in any skilled act. But we must also admit what 
James has called “general forms of discharge, that seem to be 
grooved out by habit in the brain,” such as the tendency of our 
emotions to evaporate, and of the attention to wander. Colvin 
has used the term ‘generalized habit,’”’ for those habits ‘which 
are common to a number of different stimuli.” Other writers 
use the terms ‘“‘habitude” and “habitual attitude.” 
Although we shall use the term habit, as our definition permits, 
to include this type of habitual tendency, it is most important 
that we distinguish habitude from habit in the narrower sense. 
And this to which I refer 7s not a kind of habit whose development 
is correlated with a dropping out of consciousness. The develop- 
ment of habitudes, on the other hand, may actually demand 
definite conscious reflection where previously there was none. 
Sully thus makes the distinction: In speaking of moral habitudes, 
he tells us how “The prevailing motive, for example, punctuality 
in fulfilling engagements, now passes into the form of a fixed 
inclination or active disposition. Or, to express the result 
another way, we may say that conduct is brought more fully 
under the sway of a general rule or maxim. This result is what 
is known as a moral habitude . . . The word habitude is 
here used to mark it off from ‘habit’ in the narrow sense of 
mechanical response. In following out a general maxim we 
never act mechanically as when we repeat a particular kind of  
-P-A-G-E-24
    24 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
action . . . our actions may be organised into a certain number 
of persistent norms or types of conduct, as thrift, temperance, ful- 
filment of promise and the like, they are not so uniform in their 
actual, concrete combinations as to allow of our particular actions 
becoming in the complete sense habitual. It may often require 
a good deal of reflexion before we can say what is the honest 
or the just course of action.”!°° We may therefore say that 
while we commonly think of habits which lead to action, we have 
also habits which lead to thought. 
The Term Habit.—The word habit is used both in a narrow 
and in a broad sense. In the former sense it denotes a more or 
—_ less mechanical or automatic tendency to act as we have acted 
before. In the broad sense it refers to the ‘‘tendency to think, 
feel and do as we have thought, felt or done before;” to habits of 
thought, of liberality, of attention and inattention, of grouchi- 
ness, of erect carriage; to moral habitudes and volitional dis- 
positions; in fact, to all the acquired dispositions and tendencies 
of mind and body, as our references have already indicated. 
Retention and tendency to repetition are central ideas in our 
conception of habit. It must be added that the term habit is 
used for acquired, as contrasted with native, tendencies to 
reaction such as reflexes and instincts. The only difference 
between instinct and habit is that the former is innate or inherent 
and the latter is acquired. The term habit is also used to denote, 
not only tendency to action, but the action itself; thus the skilled 
actions of the typist and the absorbed attention of the scientist 
are called habits. 
Disadvantages of the Term Habit—The term habit in too 
many minds suggests only the narrow mechanical action of 
the individual. The term habit does include those activities 
which have been made habitual to the highest degree, activities 
which are often called automatic. But habit rightly understood 
means just what the term is used to mean, from the automatic 
activities in the motor realm to the professional attitudes and 
moral habitudes. Bagley speaks of ‘‘a new habit of psychological 
observation,” and of “specific habits of cleanliness, industry, 
and mental application.”’ Andrews, in an excellent article in 
The American Journal of Psychology defines habit and gives as 
his first illustration the “attitude of ‘loyalty to Alma Mater.’ ”’ 
The habit, strictly speaking, he writes, “is the similar form as 
regards feeling which consciousness repeatedly takes.” In a
-P-A-G-E-25
  
NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF HABIT 25 
later place he quotes the following from James: “ ‘It isnot simply 
particular lines of discharge, but general forms of discharge that 
are grooved out by habit in the brain.’”” The disadvantage in 
terms exist, however, though many quotations of this kind might 
be made to show that common usage of the term includes this 
broader meaning. 
Habit in the narrow sense could never be the satisfactory 
end of education as Colvin well says, and further, as he tells 
us, we must seek in education ‘‘the disposition to learn new facts 
and acquire new habits.’ 
As mentioned above, we shall for convenience use the term 
habit to include habitude, attitude, disposition, etc., and to 
indicate any strength or type of habit at all.

  CHAPTER 2 
HABIT IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND IN THE GROUP 
Our first chapter has given some idea of the nature of habit 
and of the range and comprehensiveness of the principle of habit- 
uation; it is our interest now to look further into the problem 
of habit and consider especially two matters, namely, (1) the 
basis of habit in the individual, and, (2) the function of habit in 
civilization not only of the individual but of groups of individuals. 
Carpenter’s Well-known Statements.—It is not without 
interest that we look first at the remarks of one of the older writers 
on the subject. Much that is found in Carpenter’s Mental 
Physiology is not acceptable at the present day but the following 
on habit is still apt: 
“Tt is a matter of universal experience,” he tell us, ‘‘that every 
kind of training for special aptitudes is both far more effective, 
and leaves a more permanent impress, when exerted on the 
growing organism than when brought to bear on the adult. The 
effect of such training is shown in the tendency of the organ to 
‘grow to’ the mode in which it is habitually exercised; as is 
evidenced by the increased size and power of particular sets of 
muscles, and the extraordinary flexibility of joints, which are 
acquired by such as have early exercised in gymnastic perform- 
ances . . . There is no part of the organism of man in which 
the reconstructive activity is so great, during the whole period of 
life, as it is in the ganglionic substance of the brain. This is 
indicated by the enormous supply of blood which it receives. 
. . It is, moreover, a fact of great significance that the 
nerve-substance is specially distinguished by its reparative power 
. the study of psychology has evolved no more certain result 
than that there are uniformities of mental action which are so 
entirely conformable to those of bodily action as to indicate their 
intimate relation to a ‘mechanism of thought and feeling,’ acting 
under the like conditions with that of sense and motion. The 
psychical principle of association, indeed, and the physiological 
principles of nutrition, simply express the former in terms of 
26

  HABIT IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND IN THE GROUP 27 
mind, the latter in terns of brain—the universally admitted fact 
that any sequence of mental action which has been frequently 
repeated tends to perpetuate itself; so that we find ourselves 
automatically prompted to think, feel or do what we have been 
before accustomed to think, feel, or do, under like circumstances, 
without any consciously formed purpose, or anticipation of results. 
For there is no reason to regard the cerebrum as an exception to 
the general principle that, while each part of the organism tends 
to form itself in accordance with the mode in which it is 
habitually exercised, this tendency will be especially strong with 
the nervous apparatus, in virtue of that incessant regeneration 
which is the very condition of its functional activity. It scarcely, 
indeed, admits of doubt that every state of ideational consciousness 
which is either very strong or is habitually repeated leaves an organic 
impression on the cerebrum; in virtue of which that same state 
may be reproduced at any future time, in respondence to a 
suggestion fitted to excite it . . . The ‘strength of early asso- 
ciation’ is a fact so universally recognized that the expression of 
it has become proverbial; and this precisely accords with the 
physiological principle that, during the period of growth and 
development, the formative activity of the brain will be most 
amenable to directive influences. It is in this way that what is 
early ‘learned by heart’ becomes branded in (as it were) upon 
the cerebrum; so that its ‘traces’ are never lost, even though 
the conscious memory of it may have completely faded out. For, 
when the organic modification has been once fixed in the growing 
brain, it becomes a part of the normal fabric, and is regularly main- 
tained by nutritive substitution; so that it may endure to the end of 
life, like the scar of a wound.’’!4 (Also#4.) 
Coming nearer to the present we find James telling us “that 
we may without hesitation lay down as our first proposition the 
following, that the phenomena of habit in living beings are due to 
the plasticity of the organic materials of which their bodies are 
composed. 
“But the philosophy of habit is thus, in the first instance, a 
chapter in physics rather than in physiology or psychology. 
That it is at bottom a physical principle is admitted by all 
recent writers on the subject. They call attention to analogues 
of acquired habits exhibited by dead matter. Thus, M. Leon 
Dumont, whose essay on habit is perhaps the most philosophi- 
cal account yet published, writes: ‘Every one knows how a gar-

ment, after having been worn a certain time, clings to the shape 
of the body better than when it was new; there has been a change 
in the tissue, and this change is a new habit of cohesion. A lock 
works better after being used some time; at the outset more force 
was required to overcome certain roughnesses in the mechanism. 
The overcoming of the irresistance is a phenomenon of habituation. 
It costs less trouble to fold a paper when it has been folded already. 
This saving of trouble is due to the essential nature of habit, 
which brings it about that, to reproduce the effect, a less amount 
of the outward cause is required. The sounds of a violin improve 
by use in the hands of an able artist, because the fibres of the 
wood at last contract habits of vibration conformed to harmonic 
relations. This is what gives such inestimable value to instru- 
ments that have belonged to great masters. Water, in flowing, 
hollows out for itself a channel, which grow broader and deeper; 
and, after having ceased to flow, it resumes, when it flows again, 
the path traced by itself before. Just so, the impressions of 
outer objects fashion for themselves in the nervous system more 
and more appropriate paths, and these vital phenomena recur 
under similar excitements from without, when they have been 
interrupted a certain time.’ 
“Not in the nervous system alone. A scar anywhere is a 
locus minoris resistentiae, more liable to be abraded, inflamed, 
to suffer pain and cold, than are the neighboring parts. A 
sprained ankle; a dislocated arm, are in danger of being sprained 
or dislocated again; joints that have once been attacked by 
rheumatism or gout, mucous membranes that have been the 
seat of catarrh, are with each fresh recurrence more prone to a 
relapse, until often the morbid state chronically substitutes itself 
for the sound one. And if we ascend to the nervous system, we 
find how many so-called functional diseases seem to keep them- 
selves going simply because they happen to have once begun.’’* 
(See also 127.) 
Modern Neurology and Habit.—Let us now refer to one of 
the most recent and generally accepted authorites in neurology, 
C. J. Herrick, *°* who, in his Introduction to Neurology, asserts 
that ‘All functions of the nervous system are facilitated by 
repetition, and many such repetitions lead to an enduring change 
in the mode of response to stimulation which may be called 
physiological habit. This implies that the performance of every 
reaction leaves some sort of a residual change in the structure of
-P-A-G-E-29
  
HABIT IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND IN THE GROUP 29 
the neuron systems involved. These acquired modifications of 
behavior are manifested in some degree by all organisms, and 
this capacity lies at the basis of all associative memory (whether 
consciously or unconsciously performed) and the capacity of 
learning by experience. This modifiability through individual 
experience is possessed by the cerebral cortex in higher degree 
than by any other part of the nervous system; and the capacity 
for reacting to stimuli in terms of past experience as well as of 
the present situation lies at the basis of that docility and intelli- 
gent adaptation of means to ends which are characteristic of the 
higher mammals.” 
Further, and, remembering that reference is particularly to the 
cerebral cortex, we read that, in addition to the “hereditary 
organization, the newborn child possesses the large association 
centers of the brain with their vast and undetermined potencies, 
the exact form of whose internal organization is not wholly laid 
down at birth, but is in part shaped by each individual separately 
during the course of the growth period by the processes of educa- 
tion to which he is subjected, that is, by his experience. This 
capacity for individuality in development, this ability to profit 
by experience, this docility, is man’s most distinctive and valu- 
able characteristic. And since the form which this modifiable 
tissue will take is determined by the environing influences to 
which the child is subjected, and since these influences are largely 
under social control, it follows that human culture can advance 
by leaps and bounds wherever a high level of community life and 
educational ideals is maintained.” 
Heredity vs. Environment.—This possibility of rapid change 
made possible through~the control of experience by means of 
educational methods stands sharply in contrast to what Herrick 
has on the previous page said in regard to the possibilites of 
biological and eugenic methods: “The pattern of this hereditary 
fabric can be changed only very slowly by the agency of selective 
matings and other strictly biological factors or by degenerations 
of a distinctly pathological sort. It is thus manifest that the 
improvement of the racial stock of normal individuals by the 
practice of eugenics must necessarily be very slow, .. .” 
The burden of improvement of individuals and of the race lies 
therefore it seems not so much upon physical heredity but upon 
the environmental influences that very largely determine experi- 
ences. ‘So well have we learned the lesson,’’ continues Herrick,
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
“that the child brings with him into the world no mental endow- 
ments ready-made—no knowledge, no ideas, no morals—but 
that these have to be developed anew in each generation under 
the guiding hand of education, that we devote one-third of the 
expected span of life of our most promising youth to the educa- 
tional training necessary to ensure the highest possible develop- 
ment of the latent cultural capacities of these association centers 
of the cerebral cortex.” The student of education should read 
the two last chapters of the book; we cannot quote further. 
Upon what actually happens in the brain tissue we can only 
speculate; we may speak of paths, dispositions, tendencies, 
traces as resulting from exercise. What we may be sure of is 
that there is greater ease, promptness, sureness and effectiveness 
of activities that have been practiced; we may assume that 
changes, acquisitions have been made in terms, let us say, of 
tendencies or dispositions. 
Habit and Civilization—If now we have gained a true and 
comprehensive concept of the basis of habit and its significance 
from the point of view of neurology we are ready to look 
further and consider the function of habit from the angle of 
social psychology and sociology. And we may introduce this 
general discussion by recalling what has already been quoted 
from Herrick, namely, that whatever improvement possible by 
means of biological and eugenic methods are necessarily very 
slow, and that progress can be very rapid when dealt with by 
means of the control of experience, that is, by means of educational 
methods. 
Results in the School.—Our first reference is to some of the 
results of the experimental work done in one of the largest 
schools in New York City and reported by Irwin and Marks. 
In the ungraded department truancy was practically eliminated. 
Throughout the school, once the children had ‘‘become familiar 
with airs by MacDowell and Beethoven, they were able to render 
them with the same enjoyment they had previously derived 
from street tunes and monotonous jazz.’’ Children of low 
intelligence quotient were trained so that they could “manage 
their affairs with ordinary prudence.” The child of low grade 
mentality ‘‘is amenable to the formation of good habits while he 
is under its care, and if he is started out with well established 
practices in regard to health, work, and play, there is a strong 
likelihood that they will last.” .. . “The boy with a low
-P-A-G-E-31
a a a a 
HABIT IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND IN THE GROUP 31 
1Q who goes all the way through school and leaves it with a 
socialized friendly attitude towards others, carries within him- 
self the greatest possible protection against danger. He has 
established habits of frictionless relationships which are the best 
social safeguard that can be given him.” It appears that 
such marked improvement in children was brought about by 
the experiment in this school that the Superintendent of Schools 
of New York City designated 25 elementary schools as experi- 
mental centers.” 
Results in the Clinic.—After long years of experience in the 
clinic we have from Dr. Mateer a book on The Unstable Child 
and in this book Miss Mateer® tells us that ‘‘The psychopath 
needs a health regime. Regular living, regular meals, nourish- 
ing food, regular sleep, regular rest and work. He needs habits 
of healthful living so firmly ingrained that they will withstand 
the shocks and irregularities of everyday life. He needs a long 
period of such living, with regular demands impartially enforced. 
The problem is one of morale and habit formation.” 
“What he needs is early detection, long years of training, super- 
vised parole without stigma, and a chance to make good. He 
will repay such care as no feeble-minded can.” 
Statement from Sociology.—Our survey thus far suggests 
the somewhat greater influence of the factor of habituation, of 
the environing factors, and somewhat less fatal dependence upon 
heredity, upon the degree of deficiency, abnormality, and psychop- 
athy, than we have been led to believe. A recent volume from 
a sociologist tends to corroborate the suggestion. Bernard” in 
his book entitled Instinct very clearly shows that much that has 
been uncritically classified under instinct belongs under the 
concept of habit complexes. Environmental influences have 
their effect before birth: ‘‘Both prenatal and preconceptual 
environmental influences have had their share in producing 
the character of the child up to this point.” / 
Comparing the savage with the civilized man he asks how such 
great changes could have been made as have appeared if the 
changes depended upon heredity. Could new instincts have 
appeared fast enough to explain the changes or must we assume 
that the new demands of environment have brought the change? 
And he answers that the latter called for ‘“‘new organizations of 
the old simple innate or acquired activity units into new character 
complexes to serve as adjustment mechanisms. He points to  
-P-A-G-E-32
  32 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
the cases in which a higher record of mortality, morbidity, 
immorality, criminality, poverty, and tuberculosis show a higher 
correlation with environmental influences than with hereditary 
factors. “. . . many people without changing their race, 
sex or nationality, lose their religious reverence, change their 
political ideals and even cease to hold allegiance to historic sex 
attitudes under the pressure of modern city life.” 
“People are taken out of environments in which they have 
developed criminality, alcoholism, poverty, immorality, disease, 
etc., and are transfered to other environments better supervised 
or artifically controlled and they lose their old social and moral 
traits and build up new ones; they have their characters literally 
made over. This making over process is sometimes so effectively 
accomplished that the old environments cannot reclaim the 
transformed individuals to their former characters. In other 
cases, they tend to revert to their earlier habits whenever they 
are placed under stimuli characteristic of their earlier lives.”’ 
In like vein the writer calls attention to the difficulty of 
interpreting the sudden appearance of ability in the Italians 
in 1600 to sing grand opera in terms of a change due to bio- 
logical heredity. Such changes are due to the development of 
habit complexes brought about by the changing pressures of 
environment. 
If now we conclude that the factors of biological heredity have 
less to do with the changes in human nature than we have thought 
we must not lose sight of the immense part it does play in the 
making of a man. It may be that heredity contributes much 
more than half, perhaps, 80 to 90 per cent., to the developed human 
being; whatever the proportion is we certainly do not know. 
But the changes in civilization are essentially the contribution 
of environmental influence and the making, remaking, and modify- 
ing of civilization is at bottom the making, remaking, and 
modifying of habits. The problems of education lie not so 
much, and, indeed, perhaps very little, in the analysis of the 
hereditary contribution, but in the psychology of learning. + The 
study of original nature has offered the suggestion to the student 
of education that he must look elsewhere for many facts of very 
great consequence to education; the study of learning and of 
environmental influences has contributed most of that which is of 
’ vital significance to education. We come thus naturally to the 
discussion of Habit and Education.

  CHAPTER 3 
HABIT AND THE SOCIAL HERITAGE 
Habit and Two Types of Education.—We cannot adequately 
conceive of education without considering both the acquisition 
of that which has been called the social heritage, and the higher 
type of education which includes the development of the dis- 
position to originality, initiative, productive work. The former 
or lower type of education deals with the acquisitions of skills, 
knowledge, appreciations, etc., that have been acquired pre- 
viously by the race and are now passed on to the succeeding gen- 
eration by means of social inheritance or education; the latter, or 
higher type of education, deals with the stimulation to and acqui- 
sition of the disposition to go beyond the past, to do more than 
reproduce, to take the initiative, to be original, to think and to 
bring forth the new creation. Early education is necessarily to 
a large extent of the former kind; later education is or should be 
progressively of the latter type. 
In this and the following chapters we shall consider habit in 
its relation to these two types of acquisition; in this chapter we 
shall deal, at least by emphasis, more with the lower, type of 
education, and in the following more with the higher. f In this 
discussion we shall see that education of whatever type is abso- 
lutely dependent upon the law of habit and that all acquisitions 
of any kind whatsoever are made according to the laws of habit 
formation or learning. This means that all acquisition is the 
outcome of practice, whether it be skill, knowledge, appreciation, 
or habit in either the narrower or wider meaning. Using habit 
as coordinate with these other expressions, while correct from one 
point of view, may, on the other hand, mislead many students so 
they will not thoroughly realize that habit is really fundamental 
to all acquisitions of any and all kinds. 
Paradox of Habit.—We may see, from what has already been 
said, and from what is to follow, that all results of education are 
habits of some kind: habits in the realm of motor skill, habits of 
thought, memorial habits or memories, permanent likes or dis- 
34 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
HABIT AND THE SOCIAL HERITAGE 35 
  likes, the “habit of making new habits,’ moral dispositions; 
but not only the making of habits but the modifying and remak- 
ing of them. Tentatively, at least, we shall define education 
as the making, modifying and remaking of more or less permanent 
tendencies or dispositions, 7. e., habits. To this can be added 
two thoughts to supplement with fundamental principles and 
this will be done later. Following our main emphasis upon the 
lower type of education in this chapter it will be shown how these 
permanent tendencies make for fixity and stability and repro- 
duction; in the next chapter how they are the only possible 
foundation for the development of originality, flexibility, ini- 
tiative, and in the moral realm may demand conscious choice 
and reflective thinking. 
Habit but Not Automatism.—Habit is thus used in this book, 
according to common usage, to refer in the broadest kind of 
way to the permanent acquisition of the individual. It is not 
to be interpreted as meaning a bringing about of automatism. 
It includes this, as in the best formed acts of skill, but it includes 
much more. Making an individual a narrow mechanical kind 
of person could never be a satisfactory or adequate work of 
educaton. Man is not made to be an automaton. In fact, 
with normal people and any right kind of education there is. no 
danger of making one an automaton. The fact is that fixity 
and plasticity exist together in the organism. The increase of 
fixity does not do away with the plasticity, though it modifies it, 
and brings not rigidity but elasticity.®? 
No Justification for Education Which Does Not Make Perma- 
nent Results.—Furthermore, there would be no excuse for 
education if the results of education were not in some way per- 
manent. If tendencies to think, feel, and do, could not be 
more or less well fixed in the organism, the efforts of teachers 
might as well stop. Just what these permanent tendencies 
shall be must be determined by society in terms of its needs, 
right desires and ideals. And the aims may be expressed in 
broad generalizations, such as, adaptation, social efficiency, 
or character. But we attain these things by acquiring the 
habits and by later modifying these habits and forming new 
ones to bring better adaptation, greater efficiency, the higher 
development of character. Social organization depends on 
custom and custom depends on habit. Evolution appears to 
provide for just this bringing about of fixity and for the sub-
-P-A-G-E-36
  36 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
sequent breaking up of the fixity for the purpose of further 
progress. Witness the change from plasticity to fixity from 
infancy to old age and the production of plasticity again by 
means of the new generation. Witness in the course of history 
the development of forms in social usage and the breaking up of 
these forms or their modification for further progress. 
The forming, modifying and remaking of habits, habitudes, 
dispositions, tendencies, etc., under the guidance of ideals set 
up by society, seems to be the fundamental work of education. 
The theory is not new. Witness the work of Radestock on 
“Habit and Education.”’? Many will accept this theory; 
others will be disturbed and object. It is worth noting that of 
the many people the writer has asked, none has been able to 
suggest an exception to the statement that all the results of education 
dre habits of some kind. But remember that habit as defined by 
the author means more than is commonly meant by that term 
in its narrow mechanical significance. 
Only Results in the Individual Dealt With in This Book.—Let 
it be fully understood at this point that the writer is not deal- 
ing with the results of education in society; nor with the ulti- 
mate results of education in the institutions of society. Here 
indeed, we may find other things than habits as the outcome 
‘of education. The only results of education considered under 
this theory of habit and, for the most part throughout this vol- 
ume, are the results in the individual. This point is of the greatest 
importance and must not be lost sight of. 
Second, and of equal importance, it must be understood and 
remembered that the writer has in mind the educational proc- 
ess in the individual. The futility and uselessness of attempting 
to give a simple definition of such complex things as education 
in its many phases, is fully apparent to the writer. There 
is no attempt to deal with education in all of its varied 
aspects. The attempt,—and it cannot, perhaps, be too much 
emphasized, or held too clearly in the mind of the reader,—is 
to deal in the most fundamental and definite way possible 
with the educational processes, the means and methods of direct- 
ing them, and the results of these educational processes in the 
individual. 
The theory can be extended to extra-individual results of 
Education, for these are preserved in customs and traditions 
which are habits of groups, and in mental products, literature,
-P-A-G-E-37
HABIT AND THE SOCIAL HERITAGE 37 
  art, law, science, inventions, etc., which are an objective form 
of retention. 
The importance of this educational process cannot be over- 
estimated. All that an individual is or can be, is the outcome 
of two things, physical heredity on the one hand, and educa- 
tion, or social heredity, on the other. Educational influences 
form, modify, change, bring about the development of that 
which is given in heredity. This process of education in the 
individual, not to speak of the education in the larger sense of 
its various aspects, ranks with the few great things in life, 7. e., 
the process of getting food and drink, that of getting shelter and 
clothing, and of obtaining social intercourse with other human 
beings. If life is to go on normally, we need all of these things. 
But, also, if living is to improve from generation to generation 
we are absolutely dependent upon education of the higher type. 
Prof. Titchener tells us that ‘‘the habit imposed by education 
becomes second nature. This, indeed, is the chief problem of 
education. In psychological language, the teacher must find 
out the child’s natural mental constitution, noticing the good 
and bad features of it, and must seek by influence of all kinds 
to accentuate the good and minimise the bad. In biological 
language, he must find out the child’s natural nervous tendencies, 
and strive—by favoring the formation of good habits—to keep 
the right channels open for the flow of mental processes and 
dam up those that lead mind astray. Natural constitution and 
natural tendency must be partly reinforced and partly checked 
by acquired constitution and acquired tendency.’’!¢ 
The Work of the Teacher.—“ All our life,”’ wrote James, ‘‘so 
far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits,—practical, 
emotional, and intellectual,—systematically organized for our 
weal or woe, and bearing us irresistibly toward our destiny, 
whatever the latter may be . . . Ninety-nine hundredths or, 
possibly, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousandths of our 
activity is purely automatic and habitual, from our rising in the 
morning to our lying down each night . . ./the teacher’s 
prime concern should be to ingrain into the pupils that assort- 
ment of habits that shall be most useful to him throughout life. 
Education is for behavior and habits are the stuff of which 
behavior consists.’’4? 
It is then the concern of the teacher to understand what 
habits should be formed, to learn how they can most economi-
-P-A-G-E-38
Fe 
38 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
cally and most thoroughly be developed, and to train himself 
in the technique which is necessary for directing the develop- 
ment of new habits and the modifications of old ones,—. e., 
the language, arithmetic, science, aesthetic, motor, attentive, 
and other kinds of habits. And not only habits which appear 
in external behavior, but also those habits which are internal 
and may never be apparent from ordinary observation, which 
may, for example, result in inhibition, in refusal to do the unkind, 
the immoral, or other undesirable act, e. g., habits of decision. 
Education and the Development of Permanent Desires and 
Interests.—It cannot, perhaps, be too much emphasized that a 
part, and an essential part of the work of education is to develop 
permanent desires and interests. Not only to read good litera- 
ture but to have a permanent interest in good literature. Not 
only to be neat or accurate or careful when required, but to 
develop the desire to be neat, accurate, and careful. And 
not only to have the idea of these things, and the permanent 
desire to attain them, but to try to do so, in order that the 
desired educational result, 7. e., the permanent tendency to think, 
feel, and do these things, may be accomplished, so far as possible. 
These, also, are fundamental to progress. What would one 
accomplish without a passion for his work? This very lack 
of passion for work is the cause of much mediocre performance. 
Fundamental Nature and Comprehensiveness of the Habit 
Theory.—If we look back over the facts already brought out 
we shall see that the theory has the advantage of bringing 
us to the fundamental elements of the learning process. Such 
a procedure cannot do other than help us to a better understand- 
ing of education. One of the most common, and also, perhaps, 
one of the wisest pieces of advice given to beginners in whatever 
field it may be, is to start at the bottom and work up. 
As to the comprehensiveness of the principle it is not a small 
thing for the teacher to realize that all results of the learning 
process come only in conformance to the laws of habit formation. 
Wherever economy is to be had it is to be had only when there is 
conformance to these laws. Disregard of them and opposition to 
them cause unnecessary waste for both the student and the 
teacher. 
It Gives Definiteness to the Work of the Teacher.—No one 
thing more than definiteness is needed in the school. And 
nothing more than the thorough application of the habit prin-
-P-A-G-E-39
  HABIT AND THE SOCIAL HERITAGE 39 
ciple to all phases of education will help to this great end. The 
great aims of education whatever they are can be interpreted 
in terms of habits. The methods of the teacher, the technique 
necessary for successful teaching, can be definitely worked out 
for the forming and modifying of original nature so as to make the 
desirable permanent dispositions. In fact the more general 
statements of the aim and work of education can be dealt with 
in the school in no other way. To develop character, social 
efficiency, to prepare for enjoyment of life, to make one ready 
for one’s vocation or profession can be done, but it cannot be done 
in general or in the abstract. These results are big complex 
things and must be dealt with by dealing with the elements that 
constitute them. The elements are thousands of habits. The 
habits are habits of thought, of feeling and of action. These 
the teacher can deal with definitely and can prepare himself to 
deal with. Thinking, feeling, and doing this, and this and this, 
and in this way, and that way and the other way, is specifically 
and definitely what the teacher can deal with. And he can do it 
with the assurance that this thinking and feeling and doing will 
determine the general outcome. 
Habits Result in Character.—There is nothing more true than 
that the definite bits of work and application that the teacher 
gets the student to do become the very texture of his life. Note 
what James says in this connection and note also that he speaks 
not merely of that which concerns skill or more mechanical habit- 
ual things but of the most complex thought processes. 
“As we become permanent drunkards by so many separate 
drinks,” he writes, “‘so we become saints in the moral, and 
authorities and experts in the practical and scientific spheres, 
by so many separate acts and hours of work. Let no youth 
have any anxiety about the upshot of his education, whatever 
the line of it may be. If he keep faithfully busy each hour of 
the working day, he may safely leave the final result to itself. 
He can with perfect certainty count on waking up some fine 
morning, to find himself one of the competent ones of his genera- 
tion, in whatever pursuit he may have singled out. Silently, 
between all the details of his business, the power of judging in 
all that class of matter will have built itself up within him as a 
possession that will never pass away. Young people should 
know this truth in advance. The ignorance of it has prob- 
ably engendered more discouragement and faint-heartedness
-P-A-G-E-40
40 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
  in youths embarking on arduous careers than all other causes 
put together.’’4° 
It Gives the Basis for Scientific Treatment and Measurement. 
This treatment of the results of education also gives the ele- 
ments that can be dealt with in a scientific manner. All that 
can be measured and all that is being measured by educational 
tests is behavior, and habits are the stuff of which behavior is 
made. It may be that some of the higher moral and aesthetic 
attitudes cannot be measured, or at least, that they cannot 
be measured in the same way that intellectual and motor habits 
of many kinds can. Difficulty with some of the more elusive 
results is no reason to fail with the quantitative treatment of 
the results that can be measured. 
Looking over the results of some of the school surveys that 
have been made one may see how often this quantative treat- 
ment has helped to point out the places where particular qual- 
itative defects appear in the work of certain teachers. The 
quantitative work, does not, then, in any way, take the place 
of, or displace qualitative work. It supplements it and it is 
the direct scientific way of getting at the places where quality 
of work is poor. The teacher will find that such a study of all 
the work of teachers in a school will be much more just to each 
one than the old method of making personal judgments. 
It Reduces All Education to the Same Terms.—Whatever of 
value comes from a fundamental principle and reducing of large 
and various activities to the same terms appears in the reducing of 
the results of education to habits. There is here a unifying 
principle. The teacher should be helped to see the far reaching 
significance of the fundamental laws of habit for all his work. 
There should come a much greater simplification of many com- 
plex matters and more clarity in the understanding of them. 
The interpretation of all education in terms of habit should help 
‘the teacher to avoid many of the violations of the laws of habit 
that are all too common in the schools of today. 
Psychological Factors Necessary to Habit Formation.—The 
emphasis on these factors is more significant than may at first 
appear. We cannot merely look at end results. We cannot 
merely think of stimuli and responses. Successful direction 
of habit formation requires a knowledge of the conscious factors, 
the intellectual and emotional factors that enter in practice. The 
presence of ideals, knowledge of successes and failures, intention
-P-A-G-E-41
  HABIT AND THE SOCIAL HERITAGE 41 
to remember, attitude of the learner, determination, knowledge 
of what to do and how to do it, etc., all are important in the 
economy of learning. Later pages will show how these and 
kindred factors are all important. 
Manifold Nature of the Teacher’s Work.—A further advan- 
tage of this habit theory of education, emphasizing as it does, 
the various kinds of habits to be formed, lies in its pointing out 
clearly the manifold nature of the teacher’s work. If the teaching 
is merely informational, instructional, it is inadequate, as this 
type of teaching deals only or at least for the most part, with 
the habits of thought. There must also be the inspirational, 
the arousing, the stimulating, for the purpose of developing the 
feeling habits, and habitudes. And, finally, there must be such 
instructing and arousing as will result in the motor conclusion, 
the tendency to act appropriately in the various situations for 
which education succeeds in preparing the individual. 
Other Aims of Education Included and Refined.—This view 
of education also includes and makes definite the various aims 
of education with which we are familiar. Adaptation, social 
efficiency, the formation of character, etc. These aims are to 
be attained through the formation of the appropriate habits. 
Adaptation comes only through the forming and modifying of 
habits. Whatever efficiency one has is the result of practice, 
and the outcome of practice is nothing more nor less than 
habit. 
The Principle is True for the Highest Results at Which Educa- 
tion Can Aim.—Sully long ago emphasized the place of habit 
in moral character, and we can perhaps, do no better than to 
quote a few sentences from his pages concerning moral char- 
acter and the education of the will. ‘The height of moral 
character,” he writes, ‘‘attained in any case is thus determined 
by the fixity and the commanding influence of the virtuous disposi- 
tion, which again is measurable in terms of the facility, or absence 
of conscious effort, of the controlling process.’’!! 
This he writes under the caption of ‘Character as organized 
Habit.” On the education of the will, he writes, “As we have 
seen in dealing with the several forms of self-control, and more 
especially with the phenomena of moral effort, the special direc- 
tion of attention to an idea serves to modify its feeling-value, 
and so its motive force. Education of will, in the sense of 
developing one’s character, turns on this fact. If only a desire
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
to be better exists we can ourselves contribute towards the 
improvement by furthering from time to time the reinstate- 
ment of the appropriate motives so as to fix them as dominant 
forces. 
Judgments, Ideas and Habits.—The teacher finds one of the 
most important and most difficult parts of his work is that of 
getting the student to think, to form correct judgments, to deal 
with ideas instead of mere words. It may be that if the school 
gave more material for thought and more of live incentive and 
brought more of the kind of appeal to thought and the kind of 
reward for thinking that life normally affords when people 
outside of school actually think, it would not be so disappointing 
a matter. The writer has seen the school room made lively 
with keen critical thinking and has seen teachers whose pupils 
could not have failed to catch some of the stimulus to more 
careful and correct thinking. Such stimulus and_ practice 
cannot fail to make desirable tendencies or habits in the field 
of thought. 
The tendency to have certain ideas or forms of thought are 
not, of course, the ideas or thoughts. Habits of thought are 
the tendencies to think more or less as one has thought before, 
and we have already shown how even the most complex think- 
ing depends at bottom on the laws of habit. Helping the student 
to think and reason is dealt with in a later chapter. 
Comprehensiveness of the Principle of Habit.—While this 
conception of education is fundamental it is also comprehensive. 
The growth of our perception is a matter of habit formation; 
perception does not actually take place until one comes to asso- 
ciate certain meanings with certain sense impressions and this 
soon is habit; memory is a kind of habit,®* depending upon asso- 
ciations which tend to recur again as they earlier appeared. 
Likes and dislikes are habits, and if we could not get our pupils to 
habitually like and prefer certain more worthy things and actions, 
and to habitually dislike and refuse other things and actions 
which are unworthy, we might well despair of ever raising them 
to any higher moral, aesthetic, or other levels whose attainment 
depends upon the higher feelings and sentiments. 
The formation of so many thousands of habits as the aim of 
education is only a more clearly defined way of saying that 
the aim of education is the development of character. For 
character, when it is analyzed, is fownd to be the sum total of
-P-A-G-E-43
  HABIT AND THE SOCIAL HERITAGE 43 
one’s habits of thinking, feeling, and doing. If the teacher 
attempts to follow the extremely vague and indefinite direction: 
Develop the characters of your pupils, there is no possible way 
in which he can go about doing it except by directing the develop- 
ment of habits. 
These Modifications Which Result in Habits Make up One’s 
Education.—These facts are not only fundamentally true and 
vitally important, but also give the basis for the much needed 
definiteness and specificness to the problem of and procedure 
in education. This it can do by defining the habits to be formed, 
thousands of habits of spelling, of arithmetic, of French, 
of German, of mechanical acts and skill, etc. It would thus 
have end products, z.e., behavior which results from habits 
formed, which could be measured. This, furthermore, is exactly 
what is measured by the educational examinations and tests at 
the present time. 
Taking certain habits as the ends to be attained, the teacher 
could have a clear and definite idea of his work and could be 
able to look for the particular means of attaining these ends 
and know when he has attained them. 
Having now looked at the lower type of education with its 
greater predominance of fixity, let us turn to the other aspect 
in which the remaking and flexibility, the foundations of origi- 
nality and initiative have their proper emphasis.

  CHAPTER 4 
HABIT AND EDUCATION FOR CREATIVE ACTIVITY 
Habit and the Higher Type of Education.—It is not difficult 
for the student to see how habit makes for the lower type of 
education, the type in which things become more fixed and stable, 
and in which the idea of automatomism seems to be dominant. 
It is not so easy to understand how this habituation is the basis 
and foundation for the highest type of education. Possibly 
nothing more illuminating in this connection could be found than 
a” study of the course of preparation made by the masters of any 
line of work. Continual and ever repeated practice, repetition, 
copying, imitation, the mastering of the best known in their 
line, would be found to be present in the apprenticeship of them 
all. But out of all this habituation there came the mastery, and 
with continued work and study there occurred the new combina- 
tion, the new departure, the modifications that made the new 
creations. As James has dwelt upon the one aspect of education, 
so has he considered the other. 
Quotation from James.—‘‘I have been accused,” he writes, 
“when talking of the subject of habit, of making old habits 
appear so strong that the acquiring of new ones, and particularly 
anything like a sudden reform or conversion, would be made 
impossible by my doctrine (the doctrine, namely, that ‘‘Educa- 
tion is for behavior, and habits are the stuff of which behavior 
consists”). Of course this would suffice to condemn the latter; 
for sudden conversions, however infrequent they may be, unques- 
tionably do occur. But there is no incompatibility between the 
general laws I have laid down and the most startling sudden 
alterations in the way of character. New habits can be launched, 
I have expressly said, on condition of there being new stimuli 
and new excitements. Now life abounds in these, and sometimes 
they are such critical and revolutionary experiences that they 
change a man’s whole scale of value and system of ideas. In such 
eases, the old order of his habits will be ruptured; and, if the 
45

new motives are lasting, new habits will be formed, and build 
up in him a new or regenerate ‘nature.’ ’’4% 
Habit and Originality—Nevertheless from one quarter we 
hear that the originality of the educated man has been spoiled 
by the college. From another quarter we are told that there 
is no one so set in his ways, so inflexible in his thinking as the 
uneducated. The fact is that the ways of the educated and 
the uneducated may become fixed, and either may fail in ability 
to be original, or what is worse, to accept the worthwhile origi- 
nality of others. 
What kinds of habits are necessary to keep one from this rut 
of stereotypy? And is it after all habit that is to blame for 
the inability to look at things from more than one point of 
view, for always thinking exactly the same thing and doing 
exactly the same thing in the similar situations of life? The 
difficulty is not in having these habits, but in not having other 
habits as well, other habits from which one may choose and 
thus respond in different ways as the particular needs of the 
situation and the times demand. 
This may be shown by the following considerations. Let 
us take on the one hand, the man who has thought according 
to one point of view, and ‘in terms of one theory all his life. 
His habits of thinking are fixed and his actions are always in 
accordance with this one fixed mode of thinking. On the 
other hand, take the man who has thought out the same prob- 
lems from different points of view; 7. e., who has formed several 
habits of thought where the other man had one. He may, 
therefore, act not merely in some one fixed way, but in one 
situation at one time one of these habits of thought may 
gain the ascendency and determine the action, at another time 
another of the habits of thought may win out and determine 
the response. 
The Danger of Too Much Fixity.—The question of the dan- 
ger of too much fixity, the killing of originality, and the like, 
may always arise to point out a possible bad effect of education, 
that is, of the formation and modification of habits. Occasion- 
ally an article appears in which the writer has endeavored to show 
that our original men are men who never had the advantage or 
disadvantage of a college education; their originality was not 
taken away from them by an education which fixed their thoughts 
in the ruts of academic thinking, in stereotyped ways of looking
-P-A-G-E-47
  HABIT AND EDUCATION FOR CREATIVE ACTIVITY 47 
at things. Suppose that for the majority of people education does 
bring about a good deal of fixity, of following in the thoughts and 
ways of the teachers, this may not be so bad considering the 
value of most of this much vaunted originality. The writer 
hazards the statement that for every list of men who have pro- 
duced valuable original things without having had formal school 
training, equally imposing lists could be made of men who have 
produced things of originality and of as great or greater value, 
who have had this school training. If a careful comparison 
were made of the products of the originality of men with and 
without school and college educations, it is not at all unlikely 
that the men of the greater amount of education would be 
found to have produced per capita more things of originality 
and of lasting value than have those without this education. 
The originality of the expert, of the man with the best knowl- 
edge of the best in his line, is, in other words, likely to be the 
most valuable, and to be just as frequently found. As has 
already been said, the instability of the individual in everyday 
life, in vocations, etc., suggests that perhaps more and not less 
fixity would be well. A recent writer tells us that the average 
length of time a man holds a position in the United States is 
less than a year. 
No Necessary Danger of Losing Plasticity through Education. 
The danger of losing plasticity that is sometimes expressed is 
not founded upon the facts of experience. We do not find 
that the man who has practised and formed many habits has 
become thereby unable to make new habits or to modify his 
old habits. The most highly educated people are not found 
to be unable to accept new ideas. True, we can find plenty of 
cases in which people appear unable to change. We find plenty 
who are “set in their way.’ But we can find also many who are 
able to change and who do change even in advanced years of 
life. It is in the advanced years that we may look for the 
fixity that does not change. And this fact of age is the one that 
we must look to if we would find that which leaves increasingly 
less and less plasticity. In other words it is senility and not the 
number of habits that means the loss of plasticity. 
Even the reflexes have not lost all plasticity but are in some 
cases at least modifiable. Angell writes ‘‘that certain of them 
are unquestionably open to modification, either through the 
direct control of the mind, as when one succeeds in suppressing
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
a tendency to wink, or through the indirect effect of general 
organic conditions.’’? 
As one can demonstrate by experiment, the winking reflex 
can be practically eliminated by practice. Have someone 
place a glass immediately in front of the eye and hit the glass 
continually with a felt hammer. The winking finally disappears. 
Flexibility Depends Partly on a Variety of Habits.—Besides 
the fact that plasticity is still present until advanced years, 
flexibility depends partly on having a variety of habits for situa- 
tions in which a variety of responses may be desired. And, 
from these habits, one should have the habit of choosing. This 
choice may take the form of choosing partly from one habit 
and partly from another. Moreover, the impulse may guide 
one to modify some old habit a little or a good deal, and the 
original comes out of such an operation if it occurs at all. 
Remember again how James pointed out that from the simplest 
thinking to the most complex, we are dependent upon the asso- 
ciations and what they can suggest. Education can train to 
habits of looking at the same thing from different points of view, 
and of reacting to the same thing in different ways. It may, in 
other words, by developing a variety of tendencies to react, 
lay the foundation which avoids the inflexibility, and which 
helps,—not merely permits,—but helps to bring about a variety 
of possible responses. 
Habit Fixes but It also Releases.—The higher centers of the 
brain are released by habit to deal with the new and problematic, 
to make further modifications which may result in habit, and to 
permit greater and greater freedom in higher and still higher 
mental problems. The absurdity of the idea that habits ‘rob 
the individual of further modifiability is shown by countless facts 
in our everyday observation. Men are all the time shifting from 
one thing to another, from one view to another, from one attitude 
to another. They are different individuals in different years 
and even, sometimes, in different months of the same year. 
Deep set habits of a life time may be changed by disappointment 
in love, in business, by great good fortune, by deep emotional 
experiences. The facts suggest that more and not less perma- 
nence would be better and render the individual and society more 
stable and efficient. 
Both fixity and flexibility are desirable, in some things the 
one, in some things the other to a larger degree. Spelling,
-P-A-G-E-49
  HABIT AND EDUCATION FOR CREATIVE ACTIVITY 49 
multiplication, addition, and many like things’ call for fixity of 
response. The choice of methods of solving problems, the taking 
of new points of view, the accepting of new ideas, demand 
thought about such things in different ways, 7. e., habits of 
thinking and of acting in different ways. 
Variety of Response a Peculiarly Human Trait.—We come to 
a most significant thing in connection with the human being 
when we deal with the more and more varied modes of response 
in a given situation. By nature man has the possibility of more 
ways of responding to situations than the lower animals. 
Through education he may find more than he could otherwise 
know. He may, in other words, through the chosen experiences 
brought about by his teachers discover responses of which he had 
never thought and of which he might not be able of himself to 
think. He may have as a result of his education very many ten- 
dencies from which to choose instead of only a fewor of only one; 
or, he may hesitate in great moral matters, where, before, he 
acted on some primitive impulse and habit arising from the 
activity of that primitive impulse. To hesitate before we do 
the immoral act may mean that we are saved; that we make the 
moral decision after all and act accordingly. So, out of educa-~ 
tion may come that higher result, the development of ideas of 
better action, from which one chooses according to the particular 
situation in which he is placed. This is a peculiarly human 
thing, that an impulse can shoot through a new brain path; that 
of many possible tendencies, one of many, instead of one only, 
may function. 
Education and Initiative—Education which fails to arouse 
the pupil to try new methods, to work out new results, to act 
in a different and more appropriate way in the varying situa- 
* tions of life would fail in that all important thing which we 
call initiative. There is education which spoils initiative; 
there is also education which arouses one to take initiative. 
There is education which makes one more resourceful, and 
which helps one to have the courage to try the new, to step out 
of the beaten road and to make a path that has not yet been 
tried and proven safe. Education must, among other things, 
develop the habit of taking the initiative. 
The basis for this initiative has already been intimated and 
it lies in the tendencies already formed in the nervous system. 
We found a few pages back that only the habitual associative  
-P-A-G-E-50
  50 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
tendencies could give us the ideas from which to choose in the 
most complicated kind of thinking. This with some feeling, 
impulse, courage, is the raw material of initiative. The pos- 
sibility of taking the inititative, of doing the new thing, lies in 
having a variety of things suggested by our associative proc- 
esses; and the likelihood that we shall do this, lies in the habit 
of choosing from among them, of combining in a new way, of 
trying to make the impulse shoot through the new path. 
Education in other words, must train us to various possi- 
bilities of response; along with these we must have formed the 
habit of thinking, reasoning, choosing, selecting, and then acting, 
and not of merely responding in a mechanical, reflex sort of way 
in either new or old situations. The continual formation and 
modification of habits should help this rather than hinder it. 
They should predispose the individual so that he may tend to 
select in new and modified ways. 
Habit is the Basis of Progress in Education.—In the first place, 
and, perhaps, most important, habit is the basis of all progress 
in education. As Professor Titchener tells us ‘Looking at life 
in the large, we may say that the period of training or educa- 
tion is a period of secondary attention, and that the following 
period of mastery and achievement is a period of derived pri- 
mary attention. Looking at experience more in detail, we see 
that education itself consists, psychologically, in an alter- 
nation of the two attentions; habit is made the basis of further 
acquisition, and acquisition gained with effort, passes in its 
turn into habit; the cycle returns, so long as the nervous sys- 
tem remains plastic.’’!8 
In another place in the same book the author emphasizes 
the value of practice whose results are habits. The passage 
is too good to leave unquoted and its significance too great to 
overlook. ‘In psychological experiments,” he writes, ‘‘the prac- 
tised observer has a threefold superiority over the unpractised: 
his attitude to the stimuli, in successive observations, is more 
nearly uniform; his attention is sustained at a higher level; and 
his discrimination is more refined. This means that the focal 
mental processes are few in number; that they are extremely 
vivid; and that they are protected by strong inhibitory forces, 
against intrusion from the outside . . . Habit is, in general, 
the outcome of practice; if practice shows us a nervous set or 
disposition in the making, habit is the set taken, the disposition 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  HABIT AND EDUCATION FOR CREATIVE ACTIVITY 51 
established; the plastic organ has hardened in some special way. 
Like practice, habit in its early stages requires attention; but 
it is to be noticed that a habit may be formed, not only by the 
repetition that practice brings, but also by any single stimulus 
that violently impresses the nervous system; the plastic mechan- 
ism may be thrown, by a sudden wrench, into a new and perma- 
nent arrangement; just as we may give a permanent bend to a 
fencing foil by a single violent lunge. We have already seen, in 
our discussion of the development of attention (pp. 98-99), that 
habits already formed are the basis of new acquisition; and we may 
remark in passing that the moral and practical importance of habit 
has often been written upon and can hardly be overestimated.”14 
Progress to Higher Stages of Efficiency.—Progress, if we look 
at the matter in the large, means breaking up one’s present 
efficiency in order to raise him to a higher stage of efficiency. 
More in detail, this means the modifying of old habits, of think- 
ing, of feeling, and of acting, as well as the making of new ones. 
It means the improvement of methods. It includes the raising 
of ideals and stimulating one to striving harder for the attaining 
of results in the direction of these ideals. Work must proceed on 
a higher level. 
Progress and Modifying the Old Habits.—The fact that old 
habits can be modified, that they are not unalterable, that they 
need not leave us unchangeable in our responses, is almost 
too well known in everyone’s experience and observation to 
need mention. I know, for example, of a man who practised 
law until he was over fifty years of age and was then called to 
be head of a large university. According to his own statement, 
the first year called for the making of many new habits and the 
modifying of old habits so that the new work could go on in 
the same habitual way in which the law work had gone. But 
the changes were made and the new work was done later in the 
same easy habitual way as the law work had been done. We 
can all, no doubt, cite many examples of this kind of thing. 
A shift from one kind of position requires a great many new 
habits and the modifying of many old habits,—but, and here 
is the essential point,—the change can and does come. The old 
habits do not leave us merely fixed and hardened. The habits 
which are already made are the foundations for the necessary 
changes, without which the adaptation to the new kind of 
work would be even more difficult.  
-P-A-G-E-52
    52 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
A quotation from the study of typewriting will show how 
this change goes on in the process of learning. Professor Book, 
in his excellent monograph on The Psychology of Skill, writes 
as follows: “Besides determining the special habits of every 
kind and order involved in the mastery of typewriting and show- 
ing concretely, by a minute history of the learning process, how 
these habits were developed and perfected as successively 
organized and recombined into associations and habits that 
bring the learner always more directly and economically to his 
goal, this study has shown the important role played in the learn- 
ing by effort and hygiene. 
“Two facts stand out above all the rest: (1) All special habits 
and associations involved in the mastery of typewriting must 
be carefully perfected. (2) They must then as rapidly as possible 
be outgrown and give way to higher and more direct habits of writing. 
Bryan and Harter were right when they said: ‘We believe that 
by no device is it possible to gain freedom in using the higher- 
order habits until the lower have been so well mastered that 
attention is not diverted by them.’ They suggested a truth of 
still greater importance when they added: ‘It is, nevertheless 
wise at all times to practise with the highest units possible, and 
thus learn all the units in their proper setting.’ The older 
elementary habits tend naturally and strongly to persist and must 
be left behind as rapidly as possible to prevent arrest. To try to 
crowd ahead before the elementary habits are sufficiently mas- 
tered to make safe the taking of a forward step, or to fail to 
perfect the elemental associations which must be combined to form 
the higher and more direct methods of writing, is fatal to progress 
or interest,’’!° 
Other points appear in the above quotation, but of interest 
in this connection are the facts that the fundamental things 
are habits, and that progress depends upon them. These habits 
can and must change, just as surely as they are necessary as 
foundation habits. 
As habit is the fundamental principle of education, so the 
determining of these habits in the directions of ideals is the 
guiding principle. The history of education is the history 
of how educators have tried to make ideals function in the lives 
of people and to bring about permanent educational possessions 
in terms of ideals. The importance of ideals can hardly be over- 
estimated and the necessity for the best ideals surely cannot.  
-P-A-G-E-53
  HABIT AND EDUCATION FOR CREATIVE ACTIVITY 53 
The following true story is a suggestion of what ideals mean 
in life. What they mean for the individual they mean for 
society. What they mean for society they mean for the whole 
world. Let the reader look to history and decide for himself 
how far the ideals of people or of individuals might be taken 
as true indication of what they shall be and do. 
Ideals and Achievement.—‘‘Success,” said the master instru- 
ment maker of the world, ‘“‘is having an ideal and living up to 
it as closely as one can.” Last November, some of the leading 
men of the country gathered to celebrate the seventy-fifth 
birthday of the man who made the statement quoted above. 
“Uncle John” Brashear for twenty-one years worked for ten 
hours a day in the South Side Mills of Pittsburg. After supper, 
in a little shop built by himself and wife with their own hands, 
he made astronomical instruments which are considered the 
best that man has produced. His first lens took three years to 
finish. The second lens took two years more and broke before it 
was finished. Dismayed at first, a word from his wife gave him 
new courage, and together they set out to make a larger and 
better lens than either of the others. After twenty-one years in 
the rolling mill he was free to give all of his time to the interest of 
his life, which was to make the best instruments possible by which 
people could study the stars. 
The most difficult problems in instrument making have been 
given him. When Professor Michelson needed optical surfaces 
that nowhere showed an error as great as one-millionth of an 
inch he asked Brashear to make them, and he made them. 
When the Canadian Government decided to have the largest 
telescope in the world they turned to Brashear. In return for a 
kindness which Professor Tyndall did him, the instrument maker 
sent him two planes and a ruled grating on which he had scratched 
lines so fine that they were sixty to the breadth of a human hair. 
Dr. Brashear says: “If there is anything in my life uncommon 
it is because from the time I was a boy, no matter what I had 
to do, I tried to do it a little better than it had ever been done 
before.”’ But Charles S. Schwab writes: ‘It seems to me that 
of all men of fame and achievement I have known, he is the 
most wonderful, . . . I have known him at times to get so 
interested in the struggle for perfection that he would turn 
out an instrument which in the making cost several times its 
selling price.”  
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
Ideals as Permanent Motives in Life-—What greater work 
can the teacher do than to develop ideals which shall function 
powerfully as motives? Note the essential factors which appear 
in the above example. On the one hand was the habitual 
thinking of perfection, on the other the permanent desire to make 
things a little better than they had ever been made before. 
Added to this was the constant effort to attain this perfection. 
So education must most vitally concern itself with ideals. It 
must do so by developing a tendency to think the ideal something, 
neatness, perfection, or what not, to feel for this thing and to 
have the habitual desire for it, and, also, to stimulate one to act 
in connection with this ideal so that the disposition to strive 
towards it becomes the habit of life.8 
The Controlling Principle of Education.—If the ideals of per- 
fection and completeness in achievement, for example, in observa- 
tion, memorization, in attainment of most valuable interests 
and sentiments, and in the mastery of skill and execution,—the 
standards in attainment in each and every bit of learning should 
be those which are reasonably and psychologically possible. 
The striving towards the ideals should reach certain standards 
at certain stages of education; thus standards should be the 
controlling principle of education. 
So the ideal may remain ever so high and unattainable,—if 
they are attainable they are not high enough;—but the stand- 
ards must be determined by the physical and mental con- 
stitution of the student. For each individual let us say: 
We will try to educate him to his best, not some one else’s 
best. 
Ideals and Standards.—The making, modifying, and remak- 
ing of habits should be done under the guidance of ideals set 
up by society. What ideals shall be set up is a problem of the 
philosophy of education and does not primarily concern us in 
this book. At bottom it is an ethical problem: what should be 
the sum total of habits of the educated person, the intellectual, 
emotional, and motor habits? 
Also the making, remaking, and modifying of habits should 
be determined as much as possible at each stage of education 
by standards determined by educators. For each mental age 
there must be certain standards which students shall be expected 
to reach in each subject or activity. We have thus three great 
principles of education. We might, of course, emphasize needs
-P-A-G-E-55
  HABIT AND EDUCATION FOR CREATIVE ACTIVITY 55 
But it is assumed that the needs of the individual and of society 
are cared for in the ideals. 
The Three Great Principles of Education.—The fundamental 
working principle of education is thus seen to be the making, 
modifying, and remaking of Habit. The guiding principle of 
education is striving towards Ideals. The controlling principle 
of education is attaining Standards. The ideals may be those 
of neatness, loyalty, accuracy, clear thinking, perfect memories, 
appreciation of the best in literature, art and science, the best 
kind of critical judgment in a chosen field of thought, accurate 
spelling of all words, perfect rendition of a piece of music, ete. 
The strivings toward these should reach certain standards deter- 
mined by educators. In terms of these principles we can give a 
more complete definition of education. Hducation is the making, 
modifying, and remaking of habits under the guidance of ideals 
and the control of standards. 
Education as Habit under the Guidance of Ideals and the 
Control of Standards.—Education, reduces, then, to the forma- 
tion of habits including habitudes and the modifications of those 
already formed. It means the remaking of the individual. 
This process goes on under the guidance of ideals and the con- 
trol of standards. Society must determine what these ideals 
shall be. Educators must determine’ the standards. The 
pressure upon the learner to acquire the necessary education, 
t.e., the necessary habits, may come from without himself, 
or the ideals may be accepted and a motive force arise within 
him to drive him on to attainment. Both of these things occur: 
society, in the persons of parent and teacher, and the demands of 
others, and ideals attained in the course of development in the 
individual all play their part. 
Factors in Creative Activity——Considering now the two types 
of education, we may see that habit is fundamental to the former 
and is the basis no less of the latter. But through the permanent 
tendencies the higher type of education is to be attained and 
by means and methods that can be explicitly set forth. In 
the first place the variety or multiplicity of habits helps to raise 
one above the narrowness of being able to react in only one way 
in a given situation; again the development of the permanent 
disposition to think, to look for new ideas, to develop new con- 
cepts, to see the new in the old rather than always the old in 
the new, and, third, from what we know about the psychology  
-P-A-G-E-56
56 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
  of thinking, as well as the psychology of learning as indicated 
from the more generally known experiments, we can push our- 
selves so as to rise above a plateau, we can work, and think, and 
ponder over the old facts and exercise the old habits of thought 
until the new combination comes, the new idea appears, the 
nervous impulse forms a new bond among the neurons, however 
little we know or can ever know as to why the thing can happen. 
Education is ever the modifying and remaking, as well as the 
making, of habits. The individual as long as he can continue in 
the course just suggested is the individual in the making and 
education is a process to be continued for all or most of life. 
It depends only upon the individual and upon the environing 
influences which make him what he is. 
As a matter of historical corroboration of what we have said 
about the place of habit in education we may look to the accom- 
plishments of educators who have been working essentially 
in terms of the habit theory. Professor Meriam, among others, 
has brought to our notice lately the very important fact that 
grade school pupils may be prepared for high school as well, and 
in some cases better, without ordinary teaching of arithmetic, 
reading, writing and spelling. The students in The University 
Elementary School of the University of Missouri, pursue four 
“studies.”’ They are, (1) Observation of nature and industrial 
activities, (2) Playing games of present interest, (3) Handwork: 
making things of immediate usefulness, (4) Enjoyment of 
stories, pictures, music. 
“Reading, writing, arithmetic and other such ‘common 
branches’ are not taught as such at all. The content of such 
branches is used only as needed in one or more of the four 
studies constituting the curriculum of this school. This does 
not mean that pupils in this school do not learn to ‘read, write 
or cipher.’ It does mean, however, that proficiency in these 
common school studies is made subordinate, as a purpose, to 
proficiency in ‘Observation,’ ‘Play,’ ‘Handwork,’ and ‘Enjoyment 
of Stories.’ Thus it might be rightly claimed that the work of 
this school should be measured, not in terms of school subjects, 
but in terms of the out-of-school activities of the pupils.’’® 
The point is that activities that children will be required to 
do can be chosen and the habits involved in these activities 
developed. The resulting proficiency can be measured. If the 
habits to be formed can be chosen the teacher has a definite
-P-A-G-E-57
ee eee PTs ee ee ee 
HABIT AND EDUCATION FOR CREATIVE ACTIVITY 57 
work to do. And the performance of the pupil in the expression 
of these habits is as definite an end product to measure as is 
possible in human beings. 
In other schools the same emphasis on activity and the direc- 
tion of activity instead of on content and information has 
been made. Notable among them are The Andover Play 
School,48 The California Play Demonstration School,*! and 
The Worcester Girls’ Trade School,**. Jones in his exellent 
monograph on “Training in Education” gives an outline of the 
principle features of these systems,*® and says: ‘Activity 
liberates reflexes involved in instincts, thus making possible the 
formation of Habits, of learning and forgetting through the 
operation of the factors and laws discussed previously. As 
pointed out and emphasized by almost every great educator and 
implied in the great systems of education, activity is the real 
basis of education.”’®° 
The principle appears in A Conduct Curriculum, for the 
Kindergarten and first Grade, written by Miss Patty Smith 
Hill and seven compilers . . . “instead of making our ‘Habit 
Inventory’ an appendix to the curriculum, then in use with its 
subject-matter, knowledge and technique, we found ourselves 
gradually transforming the curriculum, as a whole, by applying 
the principles of habit formation to all of the school subjects.’ 
Of the recent and more important literature showing the impor- 
tance and relation of habit to education we may especially 
recommend to the reader, Dewey’s, Human Nature and Conduct, 
and Barnard’s, Instinct. 
The Educative Process.—The educative process is then 
essentially that of making and modifying and remaking the 
individual’s tendencies. The process of remaking is the process 
by virtue of which he comes to acquire the disposition to rise 
above the lower type of education. And in the higher stage 
of education the individual rises above standards and achieves 
rather in terms of ideals and purposes not independent of the 
mastery attained through the lower type of acquisition, but 
building upon them is disposed to make the new combination, 
to select from a number of possible responses, to act somehow 
with valuable originality, to recognize the new in the old, and, 
indeed, to perceive the new in the new.*   
*We shall return to this subject, the higher type of education, and 
treat it from the point of view of stimulation in Chapter 17.

  PART 2: LEARNING AND RETENTION 
CHAPTER 5 
LEARNING AND HABIT FORMATION 
Habit Formation.—We have in the first four chapters briefly 
reviewed the place of habit in the development of the individual, 
and indicated the meaning of the term habit and the extensive- 
ness of habituation, not only in the individual, but in a much 
wider range of the world’s activities. Habits are of many kinds 
and of all degrees of strength. The two qualities of plasticity 
and fixity are fundamental to development and education, the 
process of education being one of continual making, modifying 
and remaking of more or less permanent dispositions. The 
burden of reproduction of the past is upon physical heredity and 
upon social heredity, 7. e., the lower type of education. The 
possibilities of progress lie in education of the higher or creative 
type and practically all progress depends, not upon physical 
heredity, but upon education. Cultivation of the desirable 
results of education is carried on under the control of standards 
and the guidance of ideals. We must now consider the detailed 
problems of habit formation or the psychology of learning. We 
shall first deal briefly with the results of habit formation and 
then consider some of the fundamental principles of 
and breaking of habits. _ 
Life and Habit Formation.—Life goes on mostly through 
habit; and any progress beyond the slow laborious doing of 
Pines as one does when learning how to do them, depends, if 
we except reflex and instinct, absolutely upon habit. More- 
over this learning as we have already shown, depends on pre- 
vious acquisitions which have become habits. If we think of 
the nervous system this means that the higher centers are con- 
cerned with the new, the problematic, the difficult, that which 
has not yet been mastered. As soon as this learning becomes 
sufficiently habitual, the lower centers take up_the activities, a

as far as they can, bring about the performances, and at the 
same time relieve the highercenters. The higher centers can 
now concern themselves with the next new problem. It is 
not to be understood that only the lower centers act accord- 
ing to this law of habit. The higher centers, the brain, also 
must be considered as taking the “‘sets” which practice gives them. 
rogress in learning shows the of activity with atten- 
_» _tion_at—first, changing into activity which is habitual; again 
attention a ing new, wh: een learned 
sufficiently well being carried on by habit. In this way all 
“progress i-made-inr skit; im memorizing, in mastering all of the ‘reactions to our world. 
"Habit brings perfection and accuracy of action, lessens fatigue 
and strain, insures an increasing degree of promptness.and-cer- 
tainty of response, and gradually eliminates things to which one 
must give attention. The scope of one’s response is thus greatly 
enlarged, and the time in which one can successfully and com- 
fortably carry on activities which have been made habitual is 
very much lengthened. Judgments and actions are better and 
quicker; and one can respond to more and more complex 
situations. 
Habits tend, within limits, to make people do the same things 
in sume ay-sick tothe sme rd or profeion; ke the

ald _coat_and wear the n in the 0 ; think-things:

they have ave never done e them: fall back on the ¢ old interpretations; 
cling to to the old. beliefs; in short, be and feel and -do-the-same 
-things in the same way. It gives a stability to the individual 
and to society. 
Habits of the broadest kind, or “‘habitudes,” it must be remem- 
bered, have a different result. They tend to make people 
respond in terms of ideals, motives, maxims, and the like, and 
require judgment and conscious reflection. Here one is made 
more rather than less conscious. 
Strong Guiding Influence of Habit.—Little do we realize, per- 
haps, the fact that habit once made determines what we shall 
do even in cases in which our conscious processes would indi- 
cate some other behavior. No better statement of this matter 
can be found than that of Prof. Titchener, who writes: ‘‘ Now 
the important point in the present connection is this: that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
    LEARNING AND HABIT FORMATION 
side which finally proves to be the stronger, in the struggle of 
secondary attention, need not necessarily be the consciously 
stronger. The conflict between working and going to the fire 
may lead to a victory for work, in spite of the fact that conscious- 
ness is more fully occupied by fire-ideas than it is by work-ideas. 
The nervous system in virtue of its own bias or leaning, has 
brought up further reinforcements on the side of work, and these 
reinforcements have directed or guided consciousness although 
they are not themselves represented in consciousness.” 
“The guiding influence of nervous bias is not a matter of 
inference, still less a matter of speculation; it can be demon- 
strated in the psychological laboratory. Suppose that we are 
measuring the time required to reply to a spoken word by another 
word of the same class or kind: to associate dog to cat, table to 
chair, and soon. The experimenter prepares a long list of words: 
cat, chair, and so forth. Then he explains to the observer the 
precise nature of the experiment: I shall call out certain words, 
he says, and you are to reply, as quickly as you can, with words 
of the same class; if I say horse, you will mention some other 
animal, and if I say pen, you will mention something else that 
has to do with writing. The observer understands, and the 
experiment begins. Suppose, further, that the experiments 
have been continued for some days. The experimenter has no 
need to repeat his explanation at every sitting; the observer 
takes it for granted that he is still to reply with a coordinate 
word. And suppose, finally, that some day, after a week’s 
work, the experimenter interrupts the series, and asks: Are you 
thinking about what I told you to do? The observer, fearing 
that he has made some error, and feeling very repentent, will 
say: No, to tell the truth I had absolutely forgotten all about it; 
it had gone altogether out of my mind; have I done anything 
wrong? He had not done anything wrong; but his answer 
shows that a certain tendency, impressed upon his nervous system 
by the experimenter’s original explanation, has been effective 
to direct the course of his ideas long after its conscious correlate 
has disappeared. And what happens here, in the laboratory, 
happens every day of our lives in the wider experience outside 
the laboratory.’ 
Importance of Early Training.—For the determination of our 
future life, our future thinking, liking, disliking, ability to do 
and ways of doing, nothing so much as the understanding of

habit, makes one realize the importance of doing early what 
one desired to do later. Competency, efficiency, mastery, are 
j eds Lian wien practice. The point is 
that Toglar application DHTES meviterle results in whatever 
field _it_may be: in the making of judgments-in the fields of 
law, or science, or business; in acquiring appreciation in the 
field of art, or of music, or of literature; in drawing, or in 
playing a musical instrument, or in anything else of which one 
ean think. 
These habits of feeling, of thinking and of acting are the things 
we fall back on in the emergencies of life, and they are what 
carry us through successfully if we come through successfully 
atall. Even the original thinking in the novel situations, depend, 
as already shown, upon the habits of thought. Or, to put it 
differently, for example, we rightly expect that the difficult 
problems will be solved better and more surely, not by one who 
has newly entered the field of thought in which the problem 
occurs, but by one who has worked in this field, who has solved 
problems and become familiar with all this kind of facts, who, in 
other words, has formed his habits of thinking in this field and 
whose judgments are, in proportion to his mastery of the field, 
likely to be sure and right. 
Knowing this, one knows, not the royal road, but what might 
perhaps be called the real stairway to efficiency or better to 
mastery of his chosen field or portion thereof. The analogy 
of the stairway is significant. It should suggest two facts, 
first, that there are habits dependent on others made earlier, 
and second, and partly for this reason, that habits should be 
fully made. Many habits are made easily, some with a single 
performance if they are simple and easy and pleasant, or if 
the experience is very vivid; but it is obvious that there are 
many desirable habits which are complex and not so pleasant 
and which do not make themselves, so to speak. The hit or 
miss method of learning, imitation of which one is conscious, 
or imitation of which one is not conscious, are sufficient for 
many of the former kinds of habits; but for the more difficult 
ones there are many conditions of which the teacher and the 
student should be conscious, many helps to the formation of 
habits of which they should be able to take advantage; many 
hindrances which they should be able either to avoid or to 
render less effective.

  LEARNING AND HABIT FORMATION 
PrincipLes oF Haprr ForMATION 
1. Learning Correctly.—That “we learn to do by doing” 
true. That we learn to do re oe doing incorrectly is 
part of this truth. Abo tudent must 
follow another precept (‘learn to do ea “a correctly,™ - Repeat 
but_repeat_onl seevtiek acaianal TRS ablation of Gh correct 
as ras comeing that is once learned is never 
entirely unlearned; that is to say, anything once made a part 
of the nervous system is never entirely wiped out. Anyone 
can pick out many incorrect habits that are a part of him. The 
spelling of a certain word was learned incorrectly; the finger 
learned to hit the wrong key on the typewriter; the wrong 
form of speech or the incorrect pronunciation crept in and became 
habitual; then there was the attempt to unlearn and relearn. 
Who does,not keenly realize the difficulty? Unlearning and 
relearning(harder than the original learning! Yes, but more 
than that, the original learning is never entirely unlearned. 
The new habit may be learned. The old habit may be submerged 
a good part of the time, or may grow weaker from disuse. But 
when one is in a hurry, or is striving the hardest for a perfect 
performance, out comes the old incorrect response. We hit 
the wrong key on the typewriter, or make the same grammatical 
error. With an understanding of the facts of habit the conclu- 
sion is obvious: learn correctly the first time, never let anything 
incorrect become habitual. Never practise unless you practise 
correctly and thoroughly; bad practice is worse than no practice; 
the pianist, the singer, the billiard player, the expert in any line 
comes to learn this sooner or later. 
2. Accuracy First, Speed Later.—As a corollary of what has 
just been said it follows that accuracy should be worked for 
first_and—that speed should be left. till later. Without doubt 
this is a principle which should govern all kinds of learning. 
The fastest’ way to progress is to go slowly at first. Speed will 
come. And the demand and pressure of circumstances can 
generally be expected to accomplish this. I have frequently 
stated this general principle to teachers and have had nothing 
but concurrence in the matter from them. 
3. Strong and Decided Initiative.t'\—As has been often 
said, in the forming of a habit, we should launch ourselves 
with as strong and decided an initiative as possible. The start
-P-A-G-E-64
    JNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
is very important. Success helps to further success. Failure 
may dishearten. 
4, Continuity of Practice.—‘‘Continuity of training,” James 
says, “is the great means of making the nervous system act 
infallibly right.” Never to permit an exception till the habit 
is fully formed is the rule. Exceptions undo much that has 
been done. They even start another habit; the habit of making 
exceptions. The more difficult the habit, the more important 
that an exception does not occur; because this makes it easier 
to fall into the way of letting them occur. 
5. Use of Every Opportunity.—The same author adds the 
following maxim: ‘‘Seize the very first opportunity to act on 
every resolution you make, and on every emotional prompt- 
ing you may experience in the direction of the habits you aspire 
to gain. It is not in the moment of their forming, but in the 
moment of their producing motor effects, that resolves and 
aspirations communicate the new ‘set’ to the brain.” 
6. Caring Enough and Determination—If a person only 
cares enough, he is likely to succeed in forming the habit he 
sets out to make. What we care enough for we generally find 
time for, and find a way to do. It is just the not caring enough 
that is as likely as anything to be the weak place. Closely 
related to this is determination; let one be determined, his mind 
be fully made up, as the phrase goes, and he has one of the 
best helps. Internally one needs this whole hearted giving of 
one’s self to the task of habit making if the habit be difficult 
and unpleasant. Caring enough, a deep thorough-going desire 
for the habit determination, high resolve, and then throwing 
one’s self into the doing,—these are invaluable internal aids. 
7. A Clear Plan.—One is more likely to do a thing if he knows 
exactly what to do and how to doit. If the method of doing, the 
way to start in, the order of sequence, or what not, are still in 
question, it takes more effort to hold to the thing. A clear 
plan eliminates many difficulties, and hesitations, and decisions 
to put off until another time. 
8. Realization of Value.—Another internal help is the realiza- 
tion of the value of the habit, if it be once formed. Knowing 
what one can accomplish with this skill; what can be attained 
with that combination of habits; how certain acquisitions can 
be applied in bettering one’s position, or salary, makes one of the 
strongest incentives. As an illustration of this, note the change
-P-A-G-E-65
  LEARNING AND HABIT FORMATION 
in attitude and efforts of students when they come to find that 
certain subjects will be of practical value to them, e. g., profes- 
sional students, who are getting the things which mean entering 
into and succeeding in their professions. 
9. Success and the Feeling of Success; Mastery and the 
Feeling of Mastery.—One needs to succeed, to master something, 
and to learn the difference it makes in the whole mental life 
and attitude of the individual. One is a different person when 
he has mastered something and has the feeling of success 
and, better, the feeling of mastery. Move slowly and surely 
towards success and towards mastering your desired habits, 
and every bit of success and the feeling of all earlier successes 
will help you. 
10. Suggestion.—Suggestion helps in various ways. You 
may have the suggestion of people. People who are accom- 
plishing things, who are doing what you want to do, who are 
enthusiastic, and who keep you in the general atmosphere of 
doing and succeeding, are by all means valuable to one who is 
trying to form difficult habits. 
Suggestion also helps when it lies in objects, and places, and 
the like. The library, the gymnasium, the study room, the 
laboratory, all are suggestions, and where work is being done 
and studying is going on, it is easier to work or to study as the 
case may be. 
11. Publishing Intentions.—Telling a friend or a few good 
friends that you are going to form a certain habit may bring 
the strongest pressure to bear. If the friends are of the right 
kind they will see that you are reminded of your resolution; 
if you fail you will be joked about it; whatever happens, you 
will either succeed or fail, not only in your own knowledge, 
but in the eyes of your friends. This has been found to help 
where everything else has failed. 
12. Penalties.—If one can enforce a penalty or get someone 
else to enforce a penalty for him he may find that he has a 
very helpful incentive. But the penalty must be a real one. 
Putting a dime in a box for each failure and having in the back- 
ground of mind the idea that when you get enough you will 
spend it for a box of candy or a theatre is not a penalty. There 
must be an actual felt loss to yourself. If you pay for every 
failure, the money in the end must be lost to you entirely. Per- 
haps the best kind of a penalty is the removal of some privilege.  
-P-A-G-E-66
\   UNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
It presses hard on one to find himself deprived of something 
which he really desires and to which he is accustomed. 
13. Putting One’s Self on Honor.—If it seems necessary, put- 
ting one’s self on honor will often help. But one should never 
do this unless he endeavors in every possible way to succeed. 
Failing when one has appealed to this kind of a last resort is 
a serious affair. 
14. Thoroughness.—Habits should be completely formed. 
Habits are the bases of later acquisitions and for that reason 
if for no other they should be fully made. A partially formed 
habit fails to bring the results that habits are known to bring, 
and which we have mentioned above. Neither is there the 
permanence that goes with the fully made habit. Perhaps the 
largest part of the difficulty with most of our learning lies in 
the fact that previous acquisitions have not been sufficiently 
f-well learned. The promptness and accuracy which some 
‘ people show in learning new things, in solving new problems, 
in applying old knowledge, lies very largely, if not almost wholly, 
except for native capacity, in the fact that the earlier acquisitions 
were thoroughly made. Getting over the ground, getting 
through, is not making the most valuable and permanent progress. 
Hinprances To Hasit ForMATION 
1. Not Caring Enough.—Some of the things that we have 
called helps to habit formation may be lacking, and a lack of 
the sincere desire is one of the most serious handicaps. Many 
things in this life are not done simply because we do not care. 
If the stimulating suggestion only happened along, or we fell 
upon the right biographical sketch, or had one of the “calico 
wives” that make “broadcloth husbands!’”’ Perhaps we would 
not settle down comfortably and say, ‘‘What’s the use?” 
2. Laziness.—Human beings, like inanimate objects, are 
subject to the law of inertia. Laziness may be merely a matter 
of habit. Again failure to rise and make necessary efforts 
may be simply that the incentives, the things that stir one up 
are lacking. 
3. Lack of Incentive.—This lack of incentive may well be 
emphasized. A word from a friend, a suggestion from a news- 
paper, or a journal, a smile of reproach may be all that is neces- 
sary to arouse one to the most strenuous efforts. If the incentive
-P-A-G-E-67
ena 
LEARNING AND HABIT FORMATION 67 
does not come and if one is not too lazy, he may find the former 
with a little effort and be a winner instead of a loser. 
4, Other Habits.—Old habits are the basis upon which new 
acquisitions are made. But it is also true that some old habits 
interfere with the formation of some new habits. Where the 
new act opposes the habitual acts, the old tendencies make the 
acquisition difficult. This is all the more true where one has 
to break an old habit or substitute a new for an old one. 
5. Difficulty and Complexity.—The habit itself may be dif- 
ficult. Progress in the formation of habits leads one to more 
and more complex and difficult problems. The advance that 
one makes renders it easier to do what has already been made 
habitual, but succeeding steps are naturally harder and dis- 
couragement may creep in. 
6. Unpleasantness.—When a thing is to be done, it is likely 
that the best thing one can do is to forget one’s feelings and 
think of the thing to be done. Old things are pleasant and 
new things are likely to be unpleasant if they require effort. 
We have, at least, to cope with that biological tendency that 
leads us to avoid the unpleasant. 
7. The Pressure of Time and Other Things.—We fail to take 
up the formation of many new habits because we have too 
many other things to do. It is the old story: I haven’t time; 
I’m too busy; I can’t get time now to do half the things I want 
to do. Time is short when we are doing things. When we 
are really busy we have not time for half of the worth while 
things. It is a question of choosing; but if we really care 
enough, and if the new habit is sufficiently valuable, the proba- 
bility is that at least most of us can find time. 
8. The Tendency to Feel without Acting.—One of the most 
insidious evils of life lies in this habit of feeling, of having a 
fine impulse or sentiment, and then letting the tendency fritter 
off without coming to any motor consequence. Instead of 
forming the desirable habits of acting in accordance with our 
fine feelings, we actually form habits of merely enjoying the 
thrill and then, likely enough, of looking for the next thrill. 
James tells us that “Every time a resolve or a fine glow of feeling 
evaporates without bearing practical fruit is worse than a 
chance lost; it works so as positively to hinder future resolutions 
and emotions from taking the normal path of discharge. There 
is no more contemptible type of human character than that of
-P-A-G-E-68
TE ge a ee 
68 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
the nerveless sentimentalist and dreamer, who spends his life 
in a weltering sea of sensibility and emotion, but who never does 
a manly concrete deed. 
The habit of excessive novel-reading and theatre-going will 
produce true monsters in this line. The weeping of a Rus- 
sian lady over the fictitious personages in the play, while her 
coachman is freezing to death on his seat outside, is the sort 
of thing that everywhere happens on a less glaring scale. Even 
the habit of excessive indulgence in music, for those who are 
neither performers themselves: nor musically gifted enough 
to take it in a purely intellectual way, has probably a relaxing 
effect upon the character. One becomes filled with emotions 
which habitually pass without prompting to any deed, and so 
the inertly sentimental condition is kept up. The remedy 
would be, never to suffer one’s self to have an emotion at a 
concert, without expressing it afterward in some active way. 
Let the expression be the least thing in the world—speaking 
genially to one’s aunt, or giving up one’s seat in a horse-car, 
if nothing more heroic offers—but let it not fail to take place.’”’** 
9. The Incomplete Learning of Other Habits.—Although 
treated in another place, it is appropriate here to mention the 
fact that incomplete learning of foundation habits interferes 
with future learning. Whereas one’s attention should be free 
to deal with the new habit that is to be formed, this incomplete 
learning necessitates giving attention to direct the old actions. 
This is a serious interference and is to be obviated by complete 
learning of one thing before going on to the next. 
Breaxine Op Hasits 
1. Never Permit the Old Habit to Function.—If possible, and 
if the consequences are not too severe on the individual, the 
best thing is to discontinue the old habit at once and completely. 
This may be extremely difficult and one may need all the 
determination, and purpose, and desire for the death of the 
old habit that is possible. “Tapering off” is a makeshift which 
may be necessary. But after all it is probably only in very 
extreme cases that it is necessary. It has the disadvantage of 
continuing the habit, of exercising it, even though it be only 
light exercise. 
2. Remove the Conditions and Suggestions for the Old Habit. 
To assist one in leaving off the old habit, all the things that 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  LEARNING AND HABIT FORMATION 69 
  suggest it should be avoided. It is easier to stay away from a 
feast than to go and not partake. If necessary remove your- 
self from the environment and the people which invite or even 
make you think of the old habit. The force of suggestion can 
hardly be too much emphasized. One may break an old habit 
with comparative ease by going to a new environment and 
among different people. And one may fall into the old habit 
again immediately on frequenting the old haunts. 
3. Develop a Substitute Habit—Train yourself to a substi- 
tute habit so that whenever you think of the old habit, the new 
one takes its place. In the development of the new habit one 
can make use of many suggestions given for the formation of 
new habits. 
4, Penalties.—As already shown, penalties, if they be real, 
are helps to the formation of habits; they are also helps to 
breaking habits. Let one suffer some unpleasant consequence 
of every lapse into the old habit and he will have a powerful 
influence to its discontinuance. 
5. A New Ideal Coupled with Strong Emotion.—Religious 
conversions give us some of the best illustrations of the break- 
ing of old habits under the guidance of a new ideal and aided 
by the strong emotional reaction that may accompany it. Find- 
ing a new center of energy as it has been termed, a new 
strong motive to action and to a new kind of life, may bring 
the desired result. Religion often accomplishes this. 
6. New Demands and Responsibilities—New demands and 
responsibilities also afford the motive power, so to speak, for 
breaking old habits and forming new ones. A new and better 
position, the presence of imitative children, the need for greater 
efficiency, the influence of a new group of business or social 
acquaintances, all help if they can be had. 
Summary of Thorndike.—Much of the general universality 
in connection with learning can be summarized as suggested by 
Thorndike, in the laws of use, disuse and effect ; connections tend 
to grow stronger through exercise and when attended by pleasant 
or satisfying concomitants; and they tend to grow weaker 
through inactivity or disuse and when accompanied by unpleas- 
ant experiences. The abbreviation which also gives us helpful 
generalization, namely, S-R, in which S stands for stimulus,—for 
bond or connection, and R for response needs to have full and 
accurate interpretation if it is to render its proper service. We
-P-A-G-E-70
    70 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
do not have here, as I have heard it called, stimulus-response 
psychology, but, rather, stimulus-connection-response psy- 
chology. The central factor must not be overlooked and it might 
be more helpful to write our abbreviation SCR in order to put 
more emphasis upon the important central factor. The stimulus 
and response are essential; but the importance of the central factor 
of thought and feeling is no less to be taken account of. Thorn- 
dike does so in his “‘ease series” such as “ease of identification 
of the bonds to be formed or broken, ease of identification of the 
states of affairs which should satisfy or annoy, and ease of 
application of satisfaction or annoyance to them;” and in his 
“interest series” in which he mentions ‘‘interest in work, interest 
in improvement, an active, inquiring attitude, attention, and 
acceptance of the work as significant to the worker’s wants;” 
and in his noting the need for ‘‘the absence of irrelevant 
emotional excitement, and the absence of worry.’ In 
succeeding chapters we shall encounter more of the central factors. 
A final word from James may conclude our statement of intro- 
ductory fundamental principles of learning: ‘As a final practical 
maxim, relative to these habits of will,’ writes James, ‘‘we may, 
then, offer something like this: Keep the faculty (we should today 
prefer to use the term disposition or habit) of effort alive in you 
by a little gratuitous exercise every day. That is, be systemati- 
cally ascetic or heroic in little unnecessary points, do every day or 
two something for no other reason than that you would rather 
not do it, so that when the hour of dire need draws nigh, it 
may find you not unnerved and untrained to stand the test. 
Asceticism of this sort is like the insurance which a man pays 
on his house and goods. The tax does him no good at the 
time, and possibly may never bring him a return. But if the 
fire does come, his having paid it will be his salvation from ruin. 
So with the man who has daily inured himself to habits of con- 
centrated attention, energetic volition, and self-denial in unneces- 
sary things. He will stand like a tower when everything rocks 
around him, and when his softer fellow-mortals are winnowed 
like chaff in the blast.”

  CHAPTER 6 
LEARNING THROUGH THE SENSES AND BY REASONING 
The Acquisition of Knowledge.—Lower organisms come into 
life and seem to adapt themselves with comparative ease to 
their environment. They do adapt themselves with less 
difficulty than the higher organisms. This is true, partly, because 
their inherited tendencies suffice to a very large degree to adapt 
‘them, and partly, because they have no such complex environ- 
ment to which to become adapted as have the higher organisms. 
It is, however, not until we come to the highest form of life, 
namely, man, that we find the learning process must go on for a 
good many years before the individual is prepared to do what 
human beings consider really effective living. And it is only 
in the years beyond babyhood and earliest childhood that the 
conscious, self directed learning, called study goes on. The 
young child can learn but he cannot study. 
When he does come to study, in the home, in the school 
room, on the playground, or later in professional life, certain 
mental processes are necessary and fundamental. Of these 
processes we may mention as perhaps the most important, the 
ones that enter into the acquisition of knowledge through the 
senses, the making of judgments, the getting of clear conceptions, 
and memorizing or making permanent, or, at least, comparatively 
permanent the acquisitions. 
The larger activities just mentioned are made possible in 
different ways. The gathering of facts may be by means of 
observation, by reading, by conversation, or by recall of facts 
formerly learned and by reasoning. Clear ideas may be had 
through sufficiently careful and prolonged observation, or by 
turning over in mind ideas recalled or thought out. The desired 
judgments can be made only through careful reasoning with 
relevant ideas. 
In acquisition selection is always going on. One selects cer- 
tain factors rather than others in the study of external things; 
one selects some ideas rather than others in reasoning. There 
72
-P-A-G-E-73
  LEARNING THROUGH SENSES AND BY REASONING 73 
is always a grouping of thoughts; ideas are grouped with other 
ideas already present; indeed, either for understanding or for 
remembering, there must be some grouping or associating of 
ideas. There is always some degree of impressing, of making 
the tendency to remember. Other processes might be men- 
tioned. In the present chapter we shall deal in turn with the 
acquisition of knowledge through the senses, and the acquisition 
of knowledge through reasoning. We may in fact classify all 
kinds of learning under these two heads for practical reasons. 
We might, of course, have another division of associative learning. 
But again let it be said and emphasized that association goes 
on in all kinds of learning and we prefer to deal with it in this 
way. 
Acquisition through the Senses: Observational Learning.— 
Four factors which determine our perceptions can be mentioned. 
These are the objects themselves, the contents of consciousness, 
mental habits, and physiological conditions. 
1. The External Object—The physical object obviously 
enough is one determinant of perception. The stimulus arouses 
the sense organ. But the sensory processes alone are not 
sufficient. The first sights, sounds, feelings and the like, of 
the infant are not the same as the sights, sounds and feelings of 
the adult. We are reasonably sure that there are no “‘percep- 
tions” in the first experiences of the infant. The impressions 
at first have no meaning. The object is not seen as the particular 
object which it is. 
2. The Contents of Consciousness.—A particularly instruc- 
tive case which illustrates the second factor is that of a man 
who was born blind and received his sight by an operation 
when an adult. He gazed at objects which were familiar to 
him through touch, but was unable to recognize them until he 
felt of them. Not until past experience, in the form of imagery 
if you please, supplemented his sense impressions, could he 
“perceive” through the sense of sight. In the same way, 
knowledge that one has, determines whether or not one can 
read a page of Latin or of any other language. Knowledge of 
an object makes it possible to observe more details of the object. 
3. Mental Habits.—Mental habits also have a great deal to 
do with our perceptions. A good illustration of this is afforded 
by the clock in the Court House tower in Minneapolis. I 
fell into the habit of asking my students what kind of numerals
-P-A-G-E-74
  
  74 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
there are on the face of thisclock. Most of them answered Roman, 
a fewsaid Arabic, and a few that there are no numerals on the face 
of this particular clock. The latter few were correct; there are 
none. But many people have ‘‘seen” them and I am sure that 
I “saw” them once or twice before I discovered that I had a good 
example of illusion to use for my classes in beginning psychology. 
On the face of this clock twelve single bars are used in place of 
numerals; but people tend to “see’? what they are in the habit of 
seeing. 
4. Physiological Processes.—The correcting of physical defects 
of school children has impressed those at all conversant with 
the facts that the physiological processes of the body and espe- 
cially those of the nervous system are exceedingly important. 
In fact, when we state the exact truth, we are obliged to say 
that mental activity, of whatever kind, is absolutely dependent 
upon the underlying physiological activities. Mental defects 
correlate with brain defects. The removal of defects of eye 
and ear and of other organs is followed by improvement in school 
work. More will be said on this subject in the chapter on 
Physical and Physiological Conditions. Suffice it to say here 
that observational learning as well as any other kind of learning 
depends directly upon good neural activity. 
Attention.—One of the results of attention is better intellectual 
work, The better the attention, the better the intellectual 
activity. Attention means mental clearness. Genius, we are 
told, is only a “protracted attention.” And it is this getting 
ideas clear and having them ¢lear for a sufficiently long time 
that is one of the essentials in learning and especially in study. 
Attention to the object, the page, the speaker, is of prime 
importance in this kind of learning; attention which is definitely 
directed to the things which are to be remembered. This 
attention needs to be, not spasmodic and wandering, but 
sustained. 
Thoroughness.—The completeness of observational learning, 
Meumann tells us, aids the memory. Where things are left 
out, where there are lost links, so to speak, memory fails to find 
the connections which should be present. Thoroughness is 
essential, but just what thoroughness means in a given case is 
a matter of judgment. Only by fulfilling the requirements of a 
task is one sufficiently thorough, but thoroughness in finishing a 
woodshed is different from thoroughness in finishing parlor
-P-A-G-E-75

LEARNING THROUGH SENSES AND BY REASONING 75 
decorations. A student may not be sufficiently thorough 
even if he does all the exercises in a given lesson; he may be much 
more thorough if he does half of the exercises and masters the 
principles involved. But it must be remembered that it is the 
doing over and over again that makes an acquisition wholly ours. 
Again a student may not be sufficiently thorough even though he 
memorizes all the facts in a chapter; he may be more thorough 
if he chooses only the important facts and understands them. 
There is a quotation in Porter’s famous old book entitled, 
“The Elements of Intellectual Science’ that is worthy of the 
consideration of anyone who would become a real student: 
“The late Sir Thomas Folwell Burton advised his sons in the 
following golden words: ‘What you know, know thoroughly.’ 
There are few instances in modern times of a rise equal 
i that of Sir Edward Sugden . . . I ventured to ask him, 
What was the secret of his success; ie answer was: ‘I resolved, 
when beginning to read law, to make everything I acquired 
perfectly my own, and never to go to a second thing until I had 
entirely accomplished the first. Many of my competitors read 
as much in a day as I read in a week; but at the end of twelve 
months, my knowledge was as fresh as on the day it was acquired 
while theirs had glided away from their recollection.’ ” 
Observation with Definite Expectation.—Observational study 
may go on under either one of two conditions: first, with definite 
expectation of the things that are to be noted; second, under 
the problem of making a complete observation of everything 
under consideration. The results of the observations with and 
without definite expectation are sure to be different in most 
cases. With the expectation present a person finds what he is 
seeking more quickly; he is surer of it when he sees it; and he 
has a more comfortable feeling in being able to say, this is not it 
and that is not it, and finally, this is it and I know it; this looks 
exactly like the picture in the book, or it is exactly what the 
teacher described. 
But beware! The clear imagination of the thing to be 
observed is all too likely to make one see it as he imagines it 
rather than as it is, or possibly to think he sees it even if it is 
not present. Students find what they are looking for whether 
it is there or not. In the laboratory they find structures whether 
the microscope reveals them or not. Or they see something 
else and mistake it for the thing which is clearly imagined in 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  76 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
their own minds. The fact was reported to me recently that for 
a number of years instructors in a certain subject had “seen” 
a certain structure which had been reported to exist in a certain 
kind of plant. The existence of this structure was believed for 
several years and was found by many students. A more inten- 
sive study of the same plant later proved that no such structure 
existed. The triumph of suggestion over perception! The 
student who knows definitely what he is looking for, must then, 
make his observation as true to the facts as possible to avoid the 
influence of misleading suggestions. 
“Apperception.”—As commonly used, apperception probably 
means nothing more than perception, except that it may serve 
to emphasize the meaning side of the perception. It is true 
that a person must interpret in terms of the knowledge that he 
has; that is the only possible way. The more he knows when he 
reads a book or hears a lecture, the more he can understand and 
remember. The student generally has too few ideas under 
which to classify the new facts; one important work of an educa- 
tion is to develop more and more heads under which to classify 
new facts. In this way classifying can be more accurate. Get- 
ting mentally fossilized is mostly a matter of being unable to 
develop new ideas with which to understand and to classify. 
Taking one point of view may lead one to over look others. 
And one should remember that it is safe to look at problems 
from more than one point of view. 
Observation for Complete Analysis.—In the second place, 
observation may be made for complete analysis. A problem 
may be set: to analyze as completely as possible this plant, or 
that tissue in anatomy, or the reaction in the test tube, that is, 
to note whatever there is to note. Here the student loses the 
limiting effect of definite expectation, and he needs to limit 
the attention by the problem, noting only the things that are 
pertinent to his problem. If he is to note everything possible, 
to make an exhaustive analysis, the limitation of the attention 
is not so vital; but here one should at least be systematic and 
observe first one kind of fact and then another, for example, 
facts in relation to form, then to color, then to texture, etc., or 
in whatever order the material and problem demand. Points 
of view should be present to the student from his general infor- 
mation, and others should present themselves as the study pro- 
ceeds. The results of such study are to be verified by repeated
-P-A-G-E-77
  LEARNING THROUGH SENSES AND BY REASONING ie 
observation and by comparison with the results of others. 
It may also be remarked that besides the details to be noted, one 
should not forget to note the impression of the thing as a whole, 
that is, the general or total impression. 
Learning by Trial and Error.—What is commonly known asthe 
trial and error method of learning offers a means of producing 
results that the student can observe and from which he can select 
those results and methods that are suitable for his purpose. 
It should be remembered that the trial and error method may 
waste much time, but for simple things it may give a solution 
quickly and save time required for reasoning. If the method 
is used systematically, as by the inventor, it may give results 
that could be had in no other way. This is the method by which 
Edison is said to have discovered the filament for the incandescent 
lamp. One kind of material was used after the other and cast 
aside until finally the acceptable material was found. The 
value of a theory obtained by reasoning, the usefulness of a new 
piece of apparatus, can be known only through trying and observ- 
ing the results of the trials. 
Imitation.—Imitation has its limitations; it permits one to 
progress no farther than the model, and the value of results is 
directly dependent upon the correctness of the model. Above 
all, one should realize how much is learned through uncon- 
scious imitation, that is, imitation of which the imitator is uncon- 
scious: the acquiring of a language, of the accent, of the feeling 
for a language, pronunciation, manner of acting and of talking, 
all are or may be learned largely by imitation of which the learner 
is hardly conscious and all too likely not at all critical. Some 
of the things that go the deepest and are the hardest to eradicate 
are learned by this method. This fact alone makes it imperative 
that one have for teachers those whom one can imitate to advan- 
tage. The need for a fine personality in the teacher comes from 
the tendency towards unconscious imitation on the part of the 
student. 
Note-taking.—Learning through the senses is likely to involve 
taking notes. Taking notes is a difficult art. Reviewing poor 
notes for an examination is the cause of some if not of many 
failures. A few suggestions are pertinent. 
Just as all study should be topical, so all note-taking should 
be topical. The first thing is to know the general subject or 
problem; next to get the first main head, then the sub-heads
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
under this with illustrations for each point if possible; next 
the second main head with the sub-heads and illustrations; 
next the third main head, and so on. 
Note specific facts and the exceptions to the facts; both are 
valuable. Be sure to put down self explanatory headings, not 
mere headings that suggest that there were facts of some kind 
given. Get the facts. Do not fall into the bad habit of merely 
getting general impressions. If an address is for the pur- 
pose of inspiring, be inspired if you can; this is not the kind of 
talk on which to take notes. 
For accuracy use the words of the speaker; for speed in getting 
things written, learn to put into your own words and to abbre- 
viate. Use shorthand expressions and learn the words that 
can be omitted without loss of meaning. Be brief; the fewer 
notes you take, the more likely you will be to choose the more 
important things or at least to have a chance to train yourself 
to do this, and, what is also very important, you can attend to 
the thoughts expressed and not be so liable to put down one 
thought and lose two. Taking complete statements means a 
loss of time and is of very questionable advantage in the long run. 
Occasionally a full statement, or a definition, should be taken. 
As a rule you can find a sufficient number of full statements in 
the text-books. Remember anyway that the speaker gives more 
than you are to get into your notes or than you need to remember. 
Get the important things with examples to make them clear. 
Improvement in the art comes through practice. The writ- 
ing itself should become largely mechanical. Train yourself 
to give the maximum of attention to the thought and to the 
selection of what you shall write and a minimum of attention 
to the writing itself. 
Acquisition by Reasoning.—In reasoning the emphasis is on 
the selection of ideas, meanings, consequences. The picking 
out and ordering of material, facts, ideas, according to mean- 
ing, is the fundamental and essential thing to both understand- 
ing and remembering. The student, the public speaker, 
anyone, indeed, with a reasonably good memory, finds it possible 
to memorize unorganized material; but that which is organized 
can be mastered much more quickly. If the material that one 
studies is not presented with a sufficient degree of organization, 
the student will do best to organize if for himself, both for ease 
of understanding and for subsequent ability to recall it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
LEARNING THROUGH SENSES AND BY REASONING 79 
Study of this kind follows one of two directions, either the 
thinking through the thoughts of another as found in his written 
discourse or speech, or in the relatively independent reasoning 
carried on by the use of ideas present in one’s own memory. 
The two situations are, so far as the nature of the problems of 
study go, very largely the same with one exception; in the latter 
case the student is dependent upon the richness and readiness 
of his own mind to furnish the ideas with which to reason. 
Selection and Organization.—Taking selection and organi- 
zation of material as the most vital things to be accomplished 
in study of this kind, how shall we proceed? It is found, as 
might be expected, that attention to meaning is best. The 
realization of the general problem of the point at issue, of the 
purpose or aim should be sought first; then the leading thoughts 
and the subsidiary thoughts for each leading thought. Every 
concrete example that is given or that can be found is a help 
in getting the ideas clear, in knowing not vaguely but exactly 
what is meant. Concrete examples, thinking in terms of definite 
objects, etc., are valuable especially if the matter is descriptive. 
Attention to temporal relations is important if the matter is 
narrative;’ and the logical relations help wherever they can be 
found in any kind of material. Concrete examples are always 
valuable, and the ability to give a concrete example is a good 
test of clearness of thought. Experience seems to show that a 
mastery of material is aided very greatly by outlining and then 
mastering the outline. The outline emphasizes the important 
thoughts and shows relations between them; making the outline 
directs attention upon one point after another, assuring the stu- 
dent of attention to each point which goes into his outline. 
Putting the thoughts into one’s own words may help also. 
Essence of Reasoning.—The essence of all reasoning lies in 
the choosing or rejecting, the affirming or denying of any ideas 
or rather series of ideas that are present in succeeding moments 
in mind. One such affirmation or negation is a judgment; 
a series of such judgments constitutes reasoning. The raw 
material of the reasoning is the ideas of which something is 
to be affirmed or denied. The highest type of reasoning, 
so-called, requires that the former ideas be attributes of some 
larger complex, or of some phase of a situation, some partly 
hidden quality perhaps; and being able to affirm or to deny 
the consequences of these. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
    80 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
The Problem for the Student.—The problem for the student, 
when he is to do something more than merely follow the course 
of reasoning of someone else, is to reason correctly for himself. 
What helps to this do we find? The study of logic may help 
or it may not; it depends on how it is taught and how it is studied. 
But if it or anything else demands certain practice, especially, 
in the way of correct thinking, or if the student demands it of 
himself he may expect to come into the habit of correct reasoning. 
Helps to the Habits of Correct Thinking.—Following through 
good reasoning of others is a valuable aid. This is made possible 
both by the written and spoken words of another. It is obvious 
that one should choose only books in which the thinking is 
correct, clear, and helpful, not books which are vague and 
confused. Reasoning with others and finding one’s mistakes 
in the criticisms of others and in the inability to make one’s 
arguments go clearly and strikingly home to the other party 
in the discussion; studying one’s own language and developing 
one’s vocabulary, these are essential. Advance in thought and 
language will be found to go along together. 
Another help lies in the checking of the results of reasoning 
by trials or by experiment. In other words, learn to verify. 
This is done in the business and professional world and should 
be practised by the student. A sufficient fund of knowledge 
on which to do the reasoning is necessary; observation, recall 
in memory, all the results of past thinking are foundations for 
reasoning. Practice in picking out the essential attribute or 
phase of a situation, or fact that in this particular case leads to 
the right conclusion, and knowledge of right and wrong ways 
of thinking, common errors in thinking and how to avoid them, 
all help. 
The Value of Ideas.—Ideas, it is seen, are useful in several 
ways: they permit a wider range of possible judgments and 
therefore of possible modes of action; they permit the affirmation 
or the denial of a reasoned conclusion, which means perhaps 
great economy. So far as action goes, this means that memory 
can present what observation cannot in the way of suggesting the 
right performance; a course of action may be rehearsed mentally 
and judged to be satisfactory or unsatisfactory without the need 
of actually trying out and losing time. Ideas may suggest 
several things and the best tried first thus bringing a saving of 
time and effort.
-P-A-G-E-81
  LEARNING THROUGH SENSES AND BY REASONING 81 
Age and Learning.—In the modern tendency to think that 
all types of learning are about equally important at all ages, 
we may fall into the way of thinking that age, after all, is not 
so very important as a factor in acquisition. Recent experi- 
ments tend to show that students in the elementary school 
carry on reflective thinking in the same general manner as do 
high school pupils. All of which may be true, but if it is true, 
it does not in any way go to show that a greater amount of 
reflective thinking for younger pupils is a step in the direction 
of economy. 
The more important question in relation to age, is not just 
what should come early, but that acquisitions that are to be 
made, be made as early as possible. It seems that we can do 
no better than to go back to James’ statement: ‘‘The greatest 
thing, then, in all education, is to make our nervous system our 
ally instead of our enemy. Itis to fund and capitalize our acquisi- 
tions, and live at ease upon the interest of the fund. For this 
we must make automatic and habitual, as early as possible, as 
many useful actions as we can, and guard against the growing 
into ways that are likely to be disadvantageous to us, as we should 
guard against the plague.” 
The truth is that the earlier we make acquisitions the more 
they become a part of us. The better the habits the better 
foundation we have for all later acquisitions. And, further- 
more, the better we have guarded against poorer and less econom- 
ical learning. 
Jost’s Law.—Jost’s law states that ‘Of two associations which 
are of equal strength but of different ages, the older receives 
the greater intensification from a new repetition.’ Surely 
economy appears to lie in early acquisition. This does not 
mean to imply that health of the young child should in any 
way be endangered. Health is the first and most important 
thing for the young. 
Let us add the fact that some kind of habits are formed anyway 
by the child in his earliest years and the educational problem 
resolves itself not into how early shall education begin but into 
the problem of determining what those early habits shall be. After 
all, then, it is merely a choice of what habits shall be formed in 
the earliest years. It is to be hoped that the education will 
be directed and only the best habits be formed. We say, of 
course, and then forget the matter, that children know more than  
-P-A-G-E-82
  82 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
we give them credit for. Yes, they do, and they are forming 
habits which we undertake altogether too late many times to 
deal with. 
Subjects to Be Taught at Different Ages.—To come back to the 
less important problem, which is, however, of considerable 
importance. How much should age determine the content of 
what is taught? The common view, which has been current 
for a long time, is that up to the age of about eight or nine, the

student is preeminently fitted to do memory work and not 
very well able to do work that involves much reasoning. After 
this age he is especially fitted to study things that involve rea- 
soning. As Parker puts it: ‘It is commonly maintained that 
the age from six to fourteen is the best age for learning a language 
and for acquiring motor skill, and that adolescence is the golden 
age for reasoning.’”’ The newer conception is expressed by the 
same author as follows: “In opposition to this general point 
of view this chapter maintains that all types of learning are 
important at all ages.’’73 +
-P-A-G-E-83
    LEARNING THROUGH SENSES AND BY REASONING 83 
Out of the conflict of facts and opinions it is probably too 
early to draw many conclusions. But it is certain that some 
reflective thinking is beyond the grasp of children; and further 
that some reflective thinking that they can do can not be dealt 
with economically till a later age. 
The question is not what they can do, merely, but what can 
they do most economically? And this is, probably, for the 
most part to be determined. 
Other Conclusions.—It seems possible at this time to state a 
few other conclusions relative to age. Younger children lack 
a wide range of information for use as the basis for reasoning. 
Children before adolescence have fewer or no ideals, and lack 
in determination, purpose, and ‘‘mental grasp.’’ They are more 
distracted by their feelings. There is greater fatigue for the 
same amount of work and shorter study periods are necessary. 
Silent reading is faster than oral reading after about the fourth 
grade. See Fig. 1. Arithmetic is learned much more quickly 
after about ten years of age. The study of grammar shows rela- 
’ tively poor results with children, and much better results with 
adults. 
What subjects should be taught at certain ages is also com- 
plicated by social problems which are very important. The 
question has been raised especially in connection with the 
teaching of foreign languages to young people. Many children 
will never use foreign languages and many parents have objected 
to teaching them until it is known that children will need them. 
When it is found that a child will need a certain language, it is 
argued, then is time enough to teach him that language.

  CHAPTER 7 
PROBLEMS OF THINKING 
Common Tendencies in Intellectual Activity—The economy 
of study demands that the student’s thinking be accurate. It 
is of value then, to note the common natural tendencies in the 
world of thought; some of them are very likely to lead one 
astray. They are all valuable in their places and when used 
correctly. So easily does one fall into the pitfalls of incorrect 
thinking that students often become skeptical of reasoning alto- 
gether. History reveals blunder after blunder in the reasoning 
of men. It reveals also the travail through which man passed 
to find correct solutions for hisproblems. A review of the intellec- 
tual efforts of man permits us to note the advantages and dis- 
advantages of his modes of thinking. Some of these are the 
subject matter of this chapter. Perhaps the most valuable 
service such a chapter can render is to point out the dangerous 
bypaths into which one is continually liable to be led, many of 
which he may never notice if his attention is not called to them. 
Predisposition or Prejudice——It must be remembered that 
all of our thinking is subject to our particular prejudice or 
bias. Try as hard as we will it is practically impossible to 
free ourselves from all prejudice. Our points of view have been 
largely determined by our home training. The likes and dis- 
likes, the hopes and beliefs of our dear ones have become a 
part of us. So our political creed is largely a matter of prejudice 
with most of us rather than conclusions cooly and carefully 
thought out. Our hopes and our ambitions color our thinking. 
How many of us have believed that a doctrine was right because 
a dear friend accepted it! How much more the evidence for 
our side of an argument weighs with us, even though the evidence 
for the other side is better! We “preperceive” as James puts it, 
because we already have the image of the thing in mind. That 
is to say, we see things before they have appeared for observation. 
More than that we see things that cannot by any possibility 
appear for observation. Remember the structure “seen” by the 
85

  botanists in the plant which was afterwards proved to contain 
no such structure. We hear much about ‘“‘party bias” and find 
even in advanced students evidence of the fact that disputes 
arise on account of the prejudice of people. A man, for example, 
hears what he wants to hear in a lecture and afterwards in dis- 
cussion with the lecturer shows that he has interpreted the state- 
ments of the lecture not at all in accordance with the intention of 
the lecturer but according to his own prejudice. 
Some predispositions have their advantages; know just what 
you are looking for, and if it is there, you will find and recog- 
nize it more easily. Espouse a cause, and you can the more 
easily find the arguments to justify it. Get into sympathy 
with an enemy, and you can more easily see and understand 
his situation and the reasons for his actions. 
To realize the presence and the effects of predispositions is 
a means and should be a help towards guarding against our 
being misled. Granted that we cannot be without prejudice 
of some kind; we can learn to predispose ourselves to know exactly 
and clearly instead of to know just this or just that and to justify 
what we have thought or believed, or want to think or to believe. 
Empathy.—Man tends to humanize his surroundings, and 
the tendency harks back to the childhood of the race. For 
early man, all that moved and changed was supposed to have 
thoughts and feelings like hisown. Asa heritage of the childhood 
thinking of the race we have such expressions as “the angry 
storm,” “the gentle breeze,” “the fury of the elements,” and “the 
smiling sky.” Thus we are prone to think of the pillars that hold 
up ponderous weights in a humanizing kind of way. We see a 
pillar, as Titchener puts it, “plant itself doggedly under a too 
heavy pressure,—precisely as a man might do.’’ But we go on 
to read reasoning into the mind of the animal, and morality 
into the mind of the human infant. How do we know that the 
motive of a certain writer was the same as we would have had. 
The tendency to interpret in terms of our own mental proc- 
esses thus leads us to very questionable conclusions not only 
in the empathizing of inanimate things but in the particular 
conclusions in regard to the human being itself. To reason 
our own personality into things has its basis in the fact that we 
are dependent upon our own thoughts for the interpretations 
of things external to ourselves. But it is obvious that the 
tendency needs to be checked by objective facts.

PROBLEMS OF THINKING 87 
Partial, Hasty Observations and False Conclusions.—A com- 
mon, and all too common, tendency is to observe only partially, 
to notice some outstanding features of the thing observed, of 
the page read, to get a hasty total impression and afterwards, 
likely enough, to supplement this from imagination. A short 
time ago a student made a statement which was obviously the 
result of unconsciously putting together two halves of two dif- 
ferent sentences. The ideas expressed in the two sentences 
had been missed and another incorrect one substituted. 
The often quoted case of Agassiz and the fish furnishes an 
example of that kind of study which should offset the hurrying, 
superficial work of the majority of our students. The student, 
you remember, thought he had finished his observational study 
of the fish in a few hours. Agassiz taught him that he could 
see new things for several days. To be able to perceive is an 
achievement. 
Learning by Trial and Error.—The trial and error method 
may most quickly show how a simple piece of apparatus works; 
in searching for the best material for the filament for the incan- 
descent light that method may be the only way, and the inventor 
accordingly chooses it, because it offers material for observational 
learning and reasoning. But in complex and especially in danger- 
ous problems the method may be very slow or hazardous; a little 
thinking may remove both the waste of time and the danger; 
the use of reason may permit one to rehearse former performances 
and reject many useless trials; by thinking one may select the 
best way to be tried first; thus instead of shaking the clock to 
make it go, one may look for the simple thing which may set 
everything right so that it will not soon stop again. But reason- 
ing seems to be unpleasant for most people, and they fall into 
the easier habits of the trial and error method or into the habit of 
imitating wherever they can. 
Imitation.—Imitation gives us a very large part of our habits. 
We unconsciously imitate the language of those around us; 
we consciously imitate the methods of the expert workman. 
There are the advantages of directness, and concreteness, 
and a clear idea of the thing to be done and how to do it, 
economy of time and high incentive if the model is suffi- 
ciently good. But the poor model and the mistaken action mis- 
lead the imitator; how much easier and more expedient to copy 
the poor model in the shop, the poor system in the office, the

time worn methods of the mechanic than to think a little and to 
have something better. 
The student whether he be in college or in business, should 
choose the best model, and should add some reasoning also. 
The successful man must have not only sight, but insight; and 
not only insight but foresight. It is by seeing into, and through 
and beyond; by dreaming out what may be and making those 
dreams come true that one transforms a job into a position, 
and is himself transformed from a $1000.00 man into a $5000.00 
man. 
Careful Rather than Fast Work.—We need to advise students 
to do careful, accurate, work rather than to do fast work. The 
demands of life will bring the student to work fast. Speed, 
after all, is one of the late things to acquire. The stenographer 
works first for accuracy and can later force himself for speed. 
All our knowledge of habit formation, so far as it bears on this 
subject, emphasizes the need of accuracy first. Speed can and 
will come later; and later is the only time it can come without 
interfering with the quality of the work. Rapid reading and 
skimming are work for the very advanced student, or reviewer, 
not for everyone. 
The Tendency to Get General Impressions.—When Professor 
Hiram Corson, the famous teacher of English literature at 
Cornell University, advised his students to read the plays of 
Shakespeare, going rapidly over one each evening until he had 
read them all, he had in mind, as he once told me, a very valuable 
point. That was that it was highly educative to get bird’s eye 
views, general impressions, to see in a large view, things in their 
relations, somewhat as one might get their general impressions 
of a city by going over it in an air ship or riding through all its 
principal streets in an automobile. Grant that this is valuable 
and itis. Grant that it is well worth while to get general impres- 
sions, to see the significance of many facts, to be able to see the 
principles, or fundamental truths, which may be derived from 
detailed facts. The sciences demand the knowledge of detailed 
facts, and the student should realize that if he sometimes 
studies for general impressions alone, at many other times 
he must be very attentive to details for the purpose of having 
detailed knowledge. It is easy to fall into the habit of getting 
general impressions; it is not so easy to bring one’s self to the 
hard work of mastering details.
-P-A-G-E-89
  PROBLEMS OF THINKING 89 
Coincidences Considered as Matters of Cause and Effect.— 
One of the most common and misleading tendencies is that of 
regarding coincidences, things that occur together in. time, as 
having happened as cause and effect. It having been observed 
that accidents have befallen those who began a journey on Friday, 
the belief has arisen that the accident happened as an effect 
of the starting on Friday. One may ridicule, but such supersti- 
tions are so deeply set in many people that it is considered by 
some business men a bad proposition to have a room numbered 13 
in a hotel. If one analyzes like cases one finds that a few facts 
have been observed and many others overlooked. People 
have started on Friday and had no accidents. Others have 
started on other days of the week and met with accidents. The 
illustration is typical, and the tendency involved is universal: 
events, which are mere coincidences, are supposed to have 
happened with some cause and effect relationship. 
Jumping to Conclusions on the Basis of Too Few Facts.—Our 
practical every day living leads us to make many inferences 
very quickly and with brief observations that we do not need 
to stop and verify. The advantage is obvious; it saves time 
and in a large percent of cases satisfies the requirements 
of the situation. But this is just the tendency that frequently 
leads us astray. The student of sociology may spend a few 
hours in an institution and from his observations come to con- 
clusions which are wholly at variance with the facts. Many 
of those who as students have worked their way across the 
Atlantic have found that a few hours observation which a pas- 
senger can enjoy even under the best circumstances, give in 
many ways an inadequate idea of many of the workings of the 
ships. Not so long ago people concluded that a liquid would 
rise in an inverted tube from which the air had been withdrawn, 
because “nature abhorred a vacuum.” 
One may conclude that a certain method of study is the best 
because of the excellent results obtained, e. g. memorizing by 
parts. Further facts may show that another method is better. 
Memorizing by wholes rather than by parts has thus proved to 
be better. The student who makes observations in the labora- 
tory needs to realize that what he observes, far from indicating a 
scientific law, may be an exception to the rule. The fact is 
that a few observations may be very misleading; many detailed 
   
-P-A-G-E-90
  
  90 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
observations alone give safety to conclusions and then they 
should be verified by the observations of other students. 
Reasoning by Analogy.—As misleading, and probably as 
common, as any method of reasoning, is analogy, reasoning by 
similarities or by resemblances. We reason that the school 
system of Gary is very good and that since it is so good for 
Gary it would be good for our city. The likelihood is that it 
would not be good for any other city than Gary, although some 
features might and probably could be very well adapted to 
other cities. The classical example of analogy which is best 
known is that of Newton reasoning from the fall of the apple 
to the theory of gravitation which he afterwards verified by 
other methods. But it should be remembered that he did verify 
by other methods. And it should not be forgotten that for 
one analogy that has led scientists to the truth, there have been 
many that have led them astray. 
The first thing to realize is that analogy never proves any- 
thing; at best it can only suggest possible truths, and reasoning 
of some other kind is necessary to bring the proof. Only 
on the degree of similarity and the importance of the similarities 
found can truths be even indicated. Vague resemblances and 
fancied similarities are forever leading the reasoner astray and 
proving nothing. 
The economist reasons that since government ownership 
has proved good for some other country it would in like man- 
ner be good for us. But what is good for one people would 
not necessarily do for another people. Farmers have reasoned 
that if fertilizer is good for one crop it is good for another. 
But the fertilizer that is good for corn is not in like manner good 
for oats. I have an acquaintance who reasoned that since 
the daily cold plunge was excellent for her husband it would also 
be good for her. The result of her first plunge was a severe 
illness from which she did not recover for two weeks. A good 
many people who see life in terms of efficiency,—there are many 
students among the number,—are reasoning that they can work 
the long hours and sleep the few that some great people are said 
to have worked and slept. Some discover the danger; others go 
on to the breakdown. 
Reasoning from What “Ought to be” to Supposed Facts.—Rea- 
soning from the idea that a thing ought to be thus and so, isa 
dangerous kind of procedure. The fact is that we frequently
-P-A-G-E-91
  PROBLEMS OF THINKING 91 
do not find what we think ought to be. The law on this sub- 
ject ought to be so and so, but very likely it is not. Or perhaps 
we find the statement of the law and decide that the interpre- 
tation ought to be thus and so, and to our dismay find out later 
that it is very different. Perhaps a thing should be a certain 
way, but that does not alter the facts of the case. The oft 
repeated remark of one of my old teachers of mathematics is 
not without its significance: we should “‘ascertain by finding out.” 
The Conversion of Arguments.—A less common tendency is 
that of converting arguments. Students learn in psychology 
that for every psychical process there is a corresponding process 
in the nervous system. It is not uncommon for them to errone- 
ously conclude that for every process in the nervous system 
there is a corresponding psychical process. This is not true. 
The error of conversion of arguments is obvious, if from the 
statement, all college professors are adults, we concede that all 
adults are college professors. In physics we learn that equal 
volumes of gases having the same temperature and pressure have 
the same number of molecules; but to convert this and say that 
volumes having the same number of molecules have the same 
temperature and pressure, is wrong. 
Originality without Preparation.—There is also a tendency 
to attempt to be original on the basis of too few ideas, of too 
little knowledge in the field where the originality is attempted. 
To be original is one thing; to produce something that is both 
original and valuable is another. For the latter, one needs 
first to know all one can in the field of his efforts; to have many 
memories of the best in this field; to have some critical judgment 
in these matters. Then he may reasonably hope to be original 
in a valuable sort of way. 
Affirming of the Whole What is True of a Part.—Like the 
blind men who told about the elephant after each of them had 
felt of a part of the animal, we are continually reasoning from 
a part of the whole. One man said that the elephant was like 
his trunk; another said he was like his tail; another who had felt 
of a leg said he was like a tree. We reason that an organization 
is like some of the members we know. Commonly enough people 
denounce a club, or a church, or all churches, on account of the 
few rascals, or hypocrites that they know to be members. Many 
people evidently judge a college community by the noisy, loafing 
few who are generally conspicuous.
-P-A-G-E-92
  92 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
Affirming of a Part What is True of the Whole.—Commonly 
also we reason from a whole to the part. An organization is 
taken as sufficient to vouch for its members. If a man belongs 
to that organization, we say, he must be all right. Most people 
are on their guard against this particular mistake. But most 
people do exactly the same kind of thing when they accept 
every statement of a man or a book because of the established 
reputation of the individual or of the book as a whole. This 
is indeed an error against which the student must constantly 
guard. A text book may be the best that can be had but the 
excellence of the book cannot be so great that every statement 
is to be accepted. 
Reasoning from Incorrect Premises.—Much of the trickery 
used by those who would mislead the unwary consists in try- 
ing to get the victim to accept something incorrect at the outset, 
in the first statement, before he realizes that it is time to be 
on his guard. A small error at the beginning of an argument 
is sufficient to lead to the wildest conclusions. A good illustra- 
tion of this is the course of reasoning, familiar to many of us, 
by means of which we prove by faultless logic, that an obtuse 
angle is equal to a right angle. All that is needed for this 
is the incorrect start. And the error is, by the way, not very 
easy to detect. 
Proving One Thing and Assuming Proof of Another.—If a 
belief is very dear to us it is not at all uncommon to reason to 
the possibility of the belief and then to assume the probability. 
However, a thing may be possible but far from probable. It is 
possible that the world will come to an end in a few years but 
it is not probable. The student may prove that government 
ownership is good for one country and assume that he has 
proved it for his own country. One may prove objections 
against a movement and assume that the movement itself has 
been proved undesirable. But there may be more or better 
arguments in favor of it. p 
Appeal to the Feelings Instead of to the Intellect.—Everyone 
is well acquainted with this form of influencing people. In 
the court room, pictures of the sorrowing, needy wife at home, 
of the children who need the protection and care of the father, 
or the presentation of a child to the jury, are used to work 
upon the feelings. The clever writer may be able to make you 
feel that a thing is so; but to feel may lead you from the correct
-P-A-G-E-93
  PROBLEMS OF THINKING 93 
thinking. The slogan appeals largely to our feelings and carries 
conviction, especially with the crowd. When facts give out, 
when the lawyer cannot prove his case against his opponent, 
the appeal may be to the feelings by way of slander. 
Rejecting a Conclusion Because of Some Bad Arguments.— 
It seems to be a common tendency to throw things overboard in 
a wholesale fashion when one begins, instead of selecting the 
good and retaining it and rejecting the rest. “Nothing,” wrote 
Paulsen, “‘is more dangerous to a good cause than false argu- 
ments.” I know, as most of us do if we look around a little, a 
number of people, who have lost their faith because their beliefs 
were dependent upon bad arguments. When the arguments 
went, the beliefs went with them. Paulsen gives the case of 
Darwin who lost his belief in Christianity because the poor 
arguments which had been taught him in early life had to go 
by the board. The thing that the student should learn, of 
course, is that arguments may be bad and have to go, but 
that the belief, or cause, or what not, may be good, and that 
there may be good arguments if they can only be found. 
Language Difficulties.—One of the great difficulties in educa- 
tion is in the use of words. Words are easily used not to express 
ideas but in place of ideas. One child returned home from 
school and told her mother that she had learned a new word. 
What was it? “Gozinta.” What did it mean? That she did 
not know, but the teacher had said: “Two gozinta eight four 
times.” This indefiniteness of ideas in connection with language 
is the cause of most of the differences between disputants in 
ordinary arguments; the definition of terms and a few distinctions 
may show them that they have no real difference of opinion. 
Words are used in more than one sense, and ambiguity arises; 
words are employed as slogans and election cries to arouse the 
feelings and at the same time to hoodwink the intellect. Our 
natural psychological tendencies, if we are not alert and discrimi- 
nating, put us at the mercy of these things, not only when used 
by others but also when used by ourselves. A good piece of 
advice from which every student might profit, is: “Avoid being 
at the mercy of your words.” Students are often unable to 
answer a question unless it is stated in the exact words of the 
book. They are at the mercy of words. 
The Great Achievement for the Student.—The great achieve- 
ment for the student is to be clear and accurate and to under- 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  94 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
stand. To be lost in logical quibbles is small, and to put undue 
emphasis on technicalities hardly gives evidence of sincerity 
and desire for the exact truth. To think accurately and to get 
into the habit of thinking accurately is far different from the 
mere getting of conclusions or answers. In order to think clearly 
and accurately, the student must learn how to think and how to 
avoid errors in thinking. He must realize the natural tendencies 
and know when they are leading him aright and when they are 
misleading him. He must put himself resolutely to the effort 
of doing the hard work of real thinking. And it is well and 
comforting for him to remember that there are few things in 
which keener or more lasting pleasure can be found than that 
which is to be found in good intellectual work. 
QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY 
1. Distinguish between psychological tendencies of thought and logical 
errors that may result from them. 
2. What errors may occur from too much haste? 
3. What would you consider as the most common logical pitfalls for the 
student? 
4, How may predisposition or prejudice affect reasoning and even per- 
ception? 
5. Pick out as many mistakes as you can that you think you have been mak- 
ing in your studying. 
“Sg, What are some of the advantages of learning by, (A) the trial and error 
method, (B) by imitation? Name some disadvantages for each method. 
7. Are there times or studies that make the attempt to get general impres- 
sions more valuable than learning so many detailed facts? When or for 
what studies is this true? 
8. Recall instances in which pupils have answered in terms of words instead 
of ideas. What can you do to help students to get back of words to the 
ideas? What does it mean to be at the mercy of words?

CHAPTER 8 
PROGRESS AND IMPROVABILITY 
The Universality of Improvement.—With the exception of 
a very few cases, it can safely be said that there is no intellectual 
or motor activity which does not improve with practice. Where 
small improvement is noted it is likely either that the require- 
ments of life have already brought about a large share of the 
possible improvement in the given case, or, that the conditions 
for improvement are in some way lacking. Normally one can 
rightly expect, if he take advantage of the conditions of improve- 
ment, and, of course, if he have the capacity to start with, that 
very great improvement can be made in anything which he is 
willing to practice regularly and persistently. The fact stands 
out from experiments and the experiences of experts that the 
improvement can be much greater than most people ever attain. 
How easy to go a little way while the novelty continues and 
the difficulties are comparatively few and quickly overcome. 
How sure, on the other hand, is the expertness, the proficiency, 
even the mastery of practically anything, if one has the stuff 
within him and is aroused to make continuous application to 
the chosen work. To do and to do again, to fail if necessary 
and to come back with the resilience of a Damascus blade, to 
keep everlastingly at it, is the first and most fundamental con- 
dition of improvement. 
Regularity and Persistence.—It has been said that twenty 
minutes a day for a year would give an average individual the 
fundamentals of practically any science which he would study 
with this regularity. Remember James’ statement in his chap- 
ter on habit; the most frequently read and quoted chapter of 
psychology ever written. “Let no youth have any anxiety 
about the upshot of his education, whatever the line of it may 
be. If he keeps faithfully busy each hour of the working day, 
he may safely leave the final result to itself. He can with perfect 
certainty count on waking up some fine morning, to find himself 
one of the competent ones of his generation, in whatever pursuit 
95
-P-A-G-E-96
  96 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
he may have singled out. Silently, between all the details of 
his business, the power of judging in all that class of matter 
will have built itself up within him as a possession that will never 
pass away.” 
This persistence is not easy. Man is inherently lazy. He 
needs the conditions, the suggestions, motives, incentives,those 
things which bring about the sustained attention and the per- 
manent interests. Teachers note that pupils do about as well 
as they are obliged to do. We often see authors settling down 
comfortably after they have produced books which bring them 
satisfactory incomes. And the fact is that we know very little 
about the highest degrees of improvement because it is so difficult 
to get people to practice sufficiently long.

Drill—The value of drill is clearly shown by Dallenbach.”° 
In his experiment, twenty-nine 2nd grade public school pupils, 
of both sexes, were given daily for 17 weeks a ten minute exercise 
in rapid observation and reproduction of various visual materials, 
letters, digits, words, geometrical figures, etc. 
The results of the experiment show that the effect of drill 
was clearly persistent even after 41 weeks of no practice. Fur- 
ther, a special test by means of Binet’s card of objects, showed 
that the practiced children were superior to their unpracticed 
schoolmates when tested in recall and description some 50 weeks 
later. (See Fig. 2.) 
Phillips’? reports that a drill group in arithmetic made a 
much better gain than the non-drill group, being 12 per cent. 
better in fundamentals, 50 per cent. better in reasoning tests, 
and 31 per cent. better in the combined tests.

Brown! summarizes results of some of his experiments as 
follows: ‘‘Five minute drill periods upon the fundamental num- 
ber facts, preceding the daily lesson in arithmetic, were found 
to be beneficial in the sixth, seventh and eighth grades. Benefit 
was not limited to improved mastery of the number habits, but 
included increased efficiency in arithmetical reasoning.’’

panying figures. (Figs. 3 and 4.) 
Use versus Drill in Memorizing.—Kirkpatrick has given the 
results of a study in which he dealt with three methods and

products of 7 multiplied by the prime numbers from 17 to 53. 
Various groups of students, including both children and adults 
were studied, three methods being used. The methods were, 
(1) to memorize and then use the knowledge, (2) to practice 
with the help of a key, and (3) to compute the products from 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
98 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
former knowledge. He reports the value of the methods as . 
follows: ‘‘It seems that memorizing apart from use is the poor- 
est method of all, drill in using somewhat better, (if there is 
not so much effort to attain speed that there is little incidental 
learning), while the method of using previous knowledge as a 
guide in practice is the best of the three . . . The results indi- 
cate that in many lines of teaching there has been a tremen- 
dous waste of time, energy and interest in first memorizing, 
then later practicing, the use of what has been learned.’’®? 
It is likely that these results found in arithmetic would be 
largely the same in other fields, although we must always be 
very careful about generalizing from one field to another. We 
may probably say that working things out for one’s self is superior 
to memorizing or learning by use of a key or set of rules. There 
is reason to believe that the following methods from 1 to 4 
indicate increasingly better ways of learning. 
1. Memorizing and then using. Poorest. 
2. Learning by use of a key or set of rules. Better, but not 
most economical. 
3. Learning by using former knowledge to work our results. 
Better than methods 1 or 2. 
4. Learning by using former knowledge to work out results 
plus the intention or purpose of memorizing. Probably the best 
of all. The value of intention to learn has been shown in another 
place 
Definiteness of Practice.—The greatest improvement appears to 
come from the most definite practice. This means that improve- 
ment is best and fastest when one practices directly the thing 
to be done and not something else, not something very like it, 
not a combination of things, but definitely and specifically the 
thing to be improved. In other words, if one desires to improve 
his ability to remember prose, he should practice memorizing 
prose; if one desires to improve in remembering poetry he should 
practice memorizing poetry; if it be in anatomy, study anatomy; 
if it be reasoning in philosophy and logic, study philosophy and 
logic; if it be reasoning in law, study law; if it is stenography, 
study stenography, and further, if it is to write business letters, 
study and practice writing business letters; if it is writing scientific 
matter, practice that; one does not practice in a canoe if he is in 
training to win a boat race, nor does he practice swimming to 
gain improvement in the high jump.
-P-A-G-E-99
    PROGRESS AND IMPROVABILITY 99 
The whole point is that the mind works much more specifi- 
cally than most people imagine; and one cannot train in one 
thing and have equal improvement in another; the fact is that 
he may have no improvement in the other activity, or further 
that there may be actual interference. (See chapter on Trans- 
fer of Training.) The injunction, practice the thing you 
would improve in, does not mean, however, to attempt the 
higher habits before the lower habits are formed; that is, one 
does not attempt to play the pipe organ, nor to sing in opera 
at the outset; the principle indicated is that one should go as 
directly as possible to definite specific training in the habits 
desired. On the negative side one should avoid forming irrel- 
evant habits; habits which have to be modified later or per- 
haps unlearned, so far as they can be unlearned. 
Lower and Higher Order Habits Develop Together.—Experi- 
ments have shown that lower and higher order habits develop 
together. For example, in learning a language the grasp of 
larger units comes along with the attempt to grasp smaller 
units. The telegrapher finds words coming along with letters, 
and, later, sentences coming with words. The context helps 
in learning to deal with parts. This fact indicates a psycho- 
logical basis for beginning a foreign language with sentences 
instead of with words, or letters. It is perhaps too early to 
generalize fully, but it may be said that the direct method, 
which follows this procedure, is proving to be very economical 
of time and effort, and it may prove to be the most economical 
method with pupils of some if not of all ages. The great diffi- 
culty at present is to get teachers who can teach by this method. 
The Order of Learning.—The suggestion has been made that 
the order of learning is important. Work done on text books 
during the last twenty-five or more years, gives evidence of the 
value of learning in at least a good order. It is a question as 
to whether there is a best order for any material; there is no 
question among teachers that a good order of presenting topics 
of or requiring habits to be formed is exceedingly valuable. 
The best direction of action and the best order of things depend 
generally on the text or the teacher; these requirements for the 
best progress, even if there were no others, are sufficient to make 
it fully worth while to have the best teacher and the best text. 
Especially should the best teacher be had at the beginning 
so that the best foundation be laid; a poor teacher cannot do
-P-A-G-E-100
I a a a 
100 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
so much damage later; it is obvious also that a good teacher 
can carry one to a higher stage of mastery than a poorer teacher; 
so one should have the best teacher again for the most advanced 
work. 
Learning as we are going to use the activity. Experimental 
evidence, so far as it goes at present, seems to indicate that we 
should learn any new activity as nearly as possible in the way in 
which we are going to use it later. In typewriting, for example, 
it appears that we should begin by practicing typing letters or 
copying notes rather than by using formal drill exercises. How 
universal this principle may be found to be we cannot as yet 
say but theoretically we can see that this method requires the 
practice of the activities that we will later use rather than 
activities some of which we will not later use; it avoids the 
making of habits that will not later be called upon to function. 
In some learning this method may entail too great difficulty and 
discouragement. For wide generalization upon this point we 
must await further experiment. 
The Critical Attitude—In experiments where the subjects 
know their scores, their successes and failures, they make the 
best progress. The elimination of much waste lies in the pick- 
ing out of the correct responses and repeating them, and the 
picking out of incorrect responses and eliminating them. With- 
out this the student fails to make the improvement he should. 
Nor could he expect to make very much improvement unless 
he can make the necessary distinctions between what should 
be continued and what discontinued. Here again appears 
the value of the teacher and of the best possible teacher, the 
teacher who permits only the correct actions and eliminates 
the incorrect responses. This does not mean that the student 
should not try for himself and make no mistakes. It does mean 
that after the student has made mistakes, they should be corrected 
and only the correct tendencies be allowed to develop into habits. 
When Fritz Kreisler emphasized the value of thoughtful 
practice he struck one of the keynotes of improvement. Not 
only should one be persistent and practice correctly, etc., but 
he must do more than mere mechanical repetition. The latter 
drills into the nervous system, it makes for habit, but is nowhere 
so valuable as careful, thoughtful efforts. 
Improvement of Methods.—Professor James brought to our 
attention the fact that the secret of a good deal of improvement
-P-A-G-E-101
  PROGRESS AND IMPROVABILITY 101 
in memory lay in the improvement of methods. He refers 
to the experience of Mr. Thurlow Weed, who improved his 
ability of recall the events of the day by recounting them to 
his wife every evening. 
On this matter Professor James writes: ‘I do not doubt that 
Mr. Weed’s practical command of his past experiences was 
much greater after fifty years of this heroic drill than it would 
have been without it. Expecting to give his account in the 
evening, he attended better to each incident of the day, named 
and conceived it differently, set his mind upon it, and in the 
evening went over it again. He did more thinking, about it, 
and it stayed with him in consequence. But I venture to affirm 
pretty confidently, (although I know how foolish it often is to 
deny a fact on the strength of a theory), that the same matter 
casually attended to and not thought about, would have stuck in 
his memory no better at the end than at the beginning of his 
years of heroic self-discipline. He had acquired a better method 
of noting and recording his experiences, but his physiological 
retentiveness was probably not a bit improved. All improve- 
ment of memory consists, then, in the improvement of one’s habitual 
methods of recording facts.”’*® 
Recent experimentation has shown the truth of James’ state- 
ment in relation to improvement of method. Nor can this be 
too much emphasized. A fundamental fact in the problem 
of improvement is that if one wants to improve in anything, 
he should improve his methods. There is no question as to 
the great generality of this principle. 
The following study very well illustrates and emphasizes 
the importance of methods. 
Improvement in Observational Learning.—The careful study 
of Dr. Foster on the effect of practice upon visualizing throws 
light upon the ways in which learning of this kind may 
improve. During 10 weeks three adult observers practiced on 
pictures, nonsense syllables, drawings, poetry, and objects. Dr. 
Foster writes: “Ability to reproduce increased with practice, 
although the increase was rapid at first and slow later. The 
greatest gain of final over initial ability was 44 per cent.; the 
least, 6 per cent. 
The chief reasons for the practice-improvements were: | 
1. Confidence and ‘doing one’s best? replaced discourage- 
ment and ‘giving up.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
    102 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
2. Familiarity with material lessened the difficulty. 
3. The observers learned where and how to distribute atten- 
tion effectively. 
4. More efficient methods of work were adopted. Tricks 
of counting, naming, grouping, etc., were discovered and used. 
5. Regular and definite procedure replaced hap-hazard, unor- 
ganized procedure. 
In no case did practice increase the ability or even the tend- 
ency to visualize. The best reproducer of visual impressions 
was the poorest visualizer, and relied almost wholly upon verbal 
cues for recall. 
Our results show that the ability gained is very specific.’’* 
(See also 17.) 
The Feelings of Satisfaction and of Dissatisfaction.—Let one 
be satisfied with one’s efforts and progress is likely to stop. To 
be dissatisfied is one of the best indicators of better effort for 
improvement. Conscientious effort brings in better results in 
learning. As we have said before the feeling attitude, the 
realization of need for accomplishment, desire for the best 
results, caring enough, etc., are real aids to progress. Or to be 
more accurate they are the psychical aspects of the 
dispositions which result in better work. 
Can we work better when we are in the mood of it? Shall 
we wait until we feel like work in order to get the best results? 
We often do work better when we feel like it, but it is found 
that scores may be better on days when the subjects of experi- 
ments do not feel fit.. Or a subject may feel very fit and actually 
do poor work. There are many who say that they cannot 
do ‘good intellectual work unless they are in the mood for 
it. We all know that valuable thoughts come to us when we 
are thinking of something else. We know the right idea may 
flash across our minds when we least expect it. Experiments 
seem to show, however, that in the long run, we are likely to 
do more and better work if we apply ourselves independently 
of our feelings. It certainly appears that the habit of depend- 
ing upon moods may be formed and much valuable time may 
be lost by giving way to them. 
Physiological Conditions.—Good physiological conditions evi- 
dently make for better intellectual work. Some discussions 
of this point seem to err by making the judgment of individuals 
as to whether or not they felt fit the criterion of the physiological
-P-A-G-E-103
  PROGRESS AND IMPROVABILITY 103 
conditions. There are many cases where known illness cor- 
related with poor work. School children have been found to 
improve after the removal of physical defects. Proper feeding 
improves study. The importance of the subject makes it 
worthy of discussion in a separate chapter. Here it is sufficient 
to emphasize the fact, that while progress may not be interfered 
with by not feeling well, it is interfered with considerably by 
not being well. 
The Principle of Completeness of Response.—Professor Peter- 
son has called attention to a very important point which is 
undoubtedly too much overlooked in attempts to understand 
and explain improvement in learning. ‘There is no question 
that many of our attempted neural explanations involving one 
arc, or at best a few neural arcs, are altogether too simple ade- 
quately to explain in such physical terms as we desire how’ one 
act can survive over the other more or less random acts because 
of its greater success in meeting the needs of the organism 
. In a complex condition such as we actually find in the 
nervous and muscular systems, where various more or less related 
acts are involved in each reaction, some of these acts may be 
of an inhibitory nature to others under certain circumstances, 
while occasionally under other conditions all may tend rather 
positively to aid or strengthen one another. These mutually 
inhibiting or reinforcing effects would be determined not only 
by the nature and complexity of the stimulus but also by the 
inherited and acquired Sst eousel connections, bodily 
structure, etc.—of the organism” 
“In the case of the maze problem the animal on entering a 
cul de sac,—or any other path, in fact—responds more or less 
incompletely because all the subordinate activities involved 
cannot take place at once. If the animal’s progress is soon 
checked in a blind alley the animal is not seriously nonplused. 
Certain elements of the general response are tending to drain 
into other alleys that may recently have been passed, thus 
partially dividing the animal’s activity. These elements now 
prevail when the others are checked. Let us suppose that 
the correct path, A, has just been passed when the animal 
suddenly comes to the end of the cul de sac, B. The tenden- 
cies to respond to A are still surviving and now direct the impeded 
activity into this, the successful, path. If, on the other hand, 
the correct path had been chosen the first time the distracting  
-P-A-G-E-104
  104 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
impulses toward B would have become fainter and fainter as 
the animal proceeded into A, and would have finally faded 
away. The principle is not different when the complexity of 
the situation is increased. When the food is finally reached 
all the remaining delayed reactions, the tendencies, still per- 
sisting, to go into other alleys recently passed, are relaxed— 
the act as a whole is complete.’’78 
This principle, which is also called the overlapping of responses, 
is worthy of the emphasis which Professor Peterson puts upon 
it. We are undoubtedly helped to a large extent by artificial 
simplifications in psychology; we are brought back to the real 
situation by statements like the above which emphasize the great 
complexity of affairs. 
Improvement in Subnormals.—A_ study by Professor 
Woodrow, recently published,!*! suggests that subnormals can 
improve as rapidly and as well as normals in activities which 
are not beyond the mental grasp of the subnormals. Both 
normal and subnormal children, all about nine years old men- 
tally, were trained by means of a form sorting test. In his 
manuscript, Professor Woodrow concludes as follows: “To 
sum up, in the present experiment, feebleminded children 
were found to show the same amount of improvement and to 
improve in accordance with essentially the same practice curve 
as normal children of the same mental age and same initial 
ability. While in both the feebleminded and normal groups 
there existed great individual variation, it was impossible to 
discover any effects of practice which were significantly different 
for the two groups.” Also, ‘The conclusion is definitely indi- 
cated, that feebleminded children improve with practice the 
same as normal children of like mental age.” As noted by the 
writer the normal children might have been expected to outstrip 
the subnormal children if the practice had continued for a very 
long period. Subnormal children do not change mentally as do 
the normal from one age to another.

CHAPTER 9 
PLATEAUS AND HINDRANCES TO PROGRESS 
  Are Plateaus Necessary in Human Learning?—It is main- 
tained on good authority that there are no plateaus in animal 
learning. Itis also believed by some psychologists that plateaus 
are not necessary in human learning. But other psychologists 
believe that they are in the natural order of events. Plateaus, 
it may be said, are arrests in learning; one learns but comes to a 
time when he either does not, or apparently does not, make any 
progress. It may be that he takes a “slump’’ and the work is 
actually poorer than previous work. The apparent arrest, may, 
as many believe, be only apparent; progress may actually be 
going on somewhere among the neurons. 
On the one hand we have the fact that progress after a pla- 
teau is very likely to be rapid. It may be inferred from this 
that there was no actual stop in progress but that the progress 
could not be observed. It simply did not appear in objective 
results. 
On the other hand nature seems to advance by fits and starts. 
Plants grow more at one time of the year than at another. In 
the growing child increase of weight appears more at one time 
and increase in height more at another. The fact stands that 
in most learning, whether in laboratory experiments or in our 
schools, individuals show advance at times and at other times 
fail to show advance. The practical conclusions for us at present 
is that plateaus exist and that we have not been able to wholly 
eliminate them, especially under school and college conditions. 
We have therefore the problem of understanding the conditions 
or causes of plateaus and the methods for making them as few 
as possible, of postponing their appearance, and of overcoming 
them when they do appear.*#109 
The Curve of Learning.—If we can represent in a kind of ideal 
way the progress of learning of different kinds, it can be done 
only by dropping out all the variations and differences that

Progress at Different Stages of Learning.—It appears from an 
examination of the curves shown in the text that learning, so 
far as these curves go, is fast at first and later slows down. 
This is, in fact, what appears from most of the studies of learn- 
ing. It is not safe to generalize from one kind of learning to 
another and while the above facts may be true for most learn- 
ing, still we do not yet know this and we must take into account 
such studies as those of Professor Swift in which learning is 
found to be slow at first and then faster. 
In the study of Tossing and Catching Balls and in one On 
Learning Short-hand, Swift finds that the initial progress is 
slow and then very fast. As he puts it: “ . . . the learner
-P-A-G-E-109
ee ater ee Se” Se ee aha ee eee Ge eee 
PLATEAUS AND HINDRANCES TO PROGRESS 109 
seems to make no advance for a time and then springs to a 
higher level, perhaps only to fall back a little but, at all events, 
not to go higher until he has strengthened his position here.” 
Also he writes: “I have found no evidence for one or two 
special periods of delay in progress in which preparation is 
made for a higher order of habits . . . automitization is going 
on throughout the process.” 
In discussing the rapid rise found at the beginning of other 
studies of learning than his own he writes: “This immediate 
rapid rise at the beginning seems to be true only of these things 
that have symbols or other devices for handling and presenting 
ideas, and it is probable that after this first spurt, the length of 
which would vary with different sorts of material, the general 
form of the curve for learning is concave until the physiological 
limit is approached. Telegraphing involves fewer symbols, 
and the distraction of deciding on sounds and abbreviations, 
that mark the learning of the Pernin short-hand system, would 
not so greatly disturb the beginner, and so, having less thinking 
and deciding to do at the start, the learner in telegraphy would 
probably go on improving without great set backs longer than 
the short-hand writer.” 
The effect of the learner becoming able to get the context 
appeared soon after the reading of the short-hand notes began. 
Occasional spurts occurred as a result. Later many spurts 
were noted and attributed to this cause. Swift thinks that early 
rapid rise in the learning of short-hand does not occur because of 
the lack of associations also and after many associations have 
had time to form they bring about the rapid progress. Some 
concave curves are probably due to a faulty method of plotting. 
Progress and Individual Differences.—Progress of individuals 
in the ordinary classes in our schools is made more difficult 
because of the individual differences of the different pupils. 
A very few of the pupils are able to go very rapidly. Most of 
the pupils can go only at a medium rate. A number will be found 
who can keep up with the medium rate students only with great 
difficulty, and with special attention, or who cannot keep up at 
all. 
The best rate of progress for one pupil is not the best rate 
for another. It is doubtless true that for any given student it 
is right for him to go ahead at his own best rate. With small 
classes or with individuals it would be reasonably possible for   
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  110 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
the teacher to see that this was accomplished. If for no other 
reason, the possibility of better progress for all, would demand 
the best possible classification of pupils into the various classes. 
Problems of Individual Differences.—The classification of 
pupils according to their individual differences and the adapta- 
tion of education to the individual have brought many efforts, 
on the one hand of testing, and, on the other, of making wise 
application of the results of tests. Progress in learning is limited 
by a number of factors: the development of intelligence, the 
capacity for development, physical and social conditions, and 
the normal functioning of the psychosomatic functions. 
In a general classification we have the supernormal, the 
normal and the subnormal intelligence. As regards development 
we have the various mental ages, and the physiological, anatom- 
ical, and chronological ages, all of which in the perfectly 
developing individual would correspond, but which in reality 
often differ greatly. Physical conditions of which we make 
special treatment in another chapter make great variations in 
progress, and social stimulation is treated elsewhere at con- 
siderable length. The determining factors of normal functioning 
as contrasted with what Dr. Mateer calls psychopathy have 
probably not been sufficiently recognized. All these things along 
with heredity which determines the limits of capacity contribute 
to the differences among individuals. 
Tests.—The effort to determine the amounts of ability, progress 
and the possibilities of progress has brought forth many tests of 
varying nature.. The mental tests are perhaps best known: 
the individual test, such as the Stanford revision of the Binet- 
Simon scale, is the most accurate. Group tests, such as the 
Army Alpha, National, Haggerty, Otis, etc., permit the examina- 
tion of large groups in a comparitively short time. Many 
tests of achievement in particular subjects help to give more 
accurate indication of progress in various subjects. With many 
limitations all of these tests make positive and valuable contribu- 
tion when rightly used and their results properly interpreted. 
Progress depends not only upon what these tests attempt to meas- 
ure but to a great extent upon interest, application and determi- 
nation for which we have as yet only the beginnings of testing 
material and technique. 
Sorting of Pupils: “Opportunity Classes.’—In many schools 
there are slower and faster classes of pupils who are doing the
-P-A-G-E-111
  PLATEAUS AND HINDRANCES TO PROGRESS 111 
same work. This is often convenient and helpful. Where a 
school system is large enough it is advantageous if not ethically 
the duty of the school authorities, for the children to be classified 
according to ability. Two per cent. of a school population can 
be picked out as especially bright and capable of fast progress. 
A larger per cent. are unable to do the average work of the average 
student. For the sake of the teachers and for the best progress 
of the individual pupils experience indicates that there should be 
special classes. There are many kinds of makeshifts for the 
purpose of letting the brilliant student get along faster and for 
getting the poor student up to grade but the special classes are 
the real solution. 
Such classes could be called opportunity classes. The pupils 
do not need to be tagged ‘“‘supernormals”’ or ‘‘subnormals.” 
In fact it is almost necessary that they do not be called such. 
There is too much feeling aroused in the minds of both pupil 
and parent. But opportunity classes might be formed for both 
the bright and dull students. The bright students could go faster 
and do their better quality and quantity of work. For the less 
bright pupils there could be a modified curriculum. They 
could be called upon to do the kind of work they can do and at 
which they can succeed and all be greatly benefited. 
It is not the purpose of the writer to discuss at length the 
problem of special classes. But it is a matter which cannot be 
overlooked and one which teachers must more and more come 
to consider, where ever their school systems are large enough 
to permit of such a solution of individual differences. Going 
at the right pace for the great majority of pupils is going too fast 
for the dull ones. And it is not at the present day sufficient to 
give the old solution: teach the dullest in the class and the rest 
will get the lesson. We must administer our schools so that 
all students, so far as is possible, will make the best progress 
that is possible for them. It is not, by the way, the function 
of the bright pupil to stimulate the dull pupil. He is there to 
learn and not to be bored to his educational death by the 
pace required for the latter. It is the teacher’s place to do the 
stimulating. 
Causes of Plateaus.—Plateaus are variously explained by 
different writers. We do not yet fully understand plateaus 
and their causes. It is possible to state many conditions which 
are directly correlated with plateaus. These should give us a
-P-A-G-E-112
  112 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
fair basis for dealing with the problem involved. Future study 
must supply information as to what conditions are most impor- 
tant for particular subjects. 
The Nature of the Learner.—The feeling attitude is likely to 
change as one goes on in a subject; the novelty wears off, and 
the first enthusiasm dies down; interest and effort are all too 
likely to wane. Add to this the laziness of human nature, 
faintheartedness, distrust of one’s own ability, anxiety, and 
the feelings of discouragement and we have the secrets of a 
good many of the failures to get very far with anything. Dis- 
tractions at such a time can easily disturb and one may be 
wooed to a pleasanter task. Something else novel and easy 
makes the stronger appeal. Strong emotions, especially those 
that last: for a long time, indicate conditions in the individual 
that are likely to interfere with progress. Adolescent changes 
are examples of this. As already indicated physiological con- 
ditions are important and bad bodily conditions interfere with 
progress. 
Defective Training.—Poor preparation is a cause of plateaus. 
Things are not sufficiently well learned; habits not fully formed 
interfere with the advanced work, with the formation of higher 
habits. Where habits are not fully formed and one attempts to 
take the next step in advance, the attention is constantly dis- 
tracted from the new to the old activities. This is a serious cause 
of trouble and may result in disturbing both stages of the activity, 
the one which is not fully made into habit, the other which should 
have undistracted attention so that it can be properly learned 
and reduced to habit. 
Growing Complexity and Critical Stages.—It is obvious that 
work gets more complex and difficult as one proceeds; there 
are fewer improvements to make, and these few are harder to 
make; the advanced work requires the perfecting of habits 
which takes a long time. We are fairly well acquainted with 
the critical stages that appear in certain kinds of learning, 
for example, in typewriting, and in telegraphing. Two such 
critical stages are commonly distinguished. There is the 
plateau which separates the first easy learning from the stage 
in which some little or perhaps fair proficiency is gained; the 
second plateau precedes the ascent from drudgery to a consider- 
able degree of proficiency. Teachers often know just about 
the place in the student’s progress in which to look for these
-P-A-G-E-113
  PLATEAUS AND HINDRANCES TO PROGRESS 113 
plateaus and may give valuable aid and encouragement at such 
atime. The fact also appears that most people, students and 
teachers alike, have altogether too little experience with higher 
habits. We are just beginning to learn about the factors entering 
into the highest degrees of skill. 
Improper Use of Time and Effort; Poor Methods.—Plateaus 
are brought on by the improper use of time and effort. James 
long ago told us that improvement in memorizing lay largely 
in improvement of methods used. Several of our recent studies 
show that much of the lack of progress is due to poor methods. 
We are told that methods should never be left to chance. They 
should be carefully worked out and then improved as progress 
in the study shows that it is possible to improve them. 
Failure to make use of a proper distribution of time, so that 
intervals, and Jost’s law, can help the learner, mean slower 
progress, if they do not actually bring about plateaus. 
The Illusion of Progress.—In intellectual work one needs to 
be warned against the illusion of great progress which is likely 
to come with going over a large amount of material in a short 
time: the result in the long run is very often little actual gain 
and, especially, a relatively small degree of permanent retention. 
It was not vanity or conceit, but this fact which led a great scholar 
to remark that if he read as much as most of his colleagues did, 
he would know as little as they. 
The illusion of progress in a young child may occasionally 
be helpful in getting him to try to do his best. Children who 
have been given praise or good marks that they had not really 
earned have been known to live up to the praise, or the marks 
immediately afterwards. This suggests one of the factors that 
make for economic progress, namely, thoroughness of learning. 
The quotation already made from Porter is apt. The phenom- 
enal success of the lawyer was on account of his reading, not 
so much as his colleagues, but on account of his making it thor- 
oughly his. Thorough learning, completely formed habits, 
do more for the avoidance of plateaus than one ordinarily realizes. 
Observation of Principles Already Mentioned.—Many prin- 
ciples have already been mentioned whose observance make 
. for avoidance of plateaus; regularity of practice and adher- 
ence to correct practice; definiteness of practice; practice of 
the thing to be learned and not something else; the avoidance 
of irrelevant habits; the right use of time and effort; the best
-P-A-G-E-114
  114 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
‘a 
number and frequency of practice periods and intervals, and 
the like. Learning in a good order; distinguishing the correct 
from the incorrect responses and eliminating the latter; satis- 
faction only with the correct actions and results. Improve- 
ment of methods, and the continual use of the best methods,— 
methods should never be left to chance; mastery of fundamentals 
before going to something dependent upon them. The best 
physical conditions; avoidance of getting mentally stale; inde- 
pendence of moods, rest and recreation when needed; forcing 
when one tries to get on the highest levels of performance. 
Forcing One’s Self.—The fact appears from experiments and 
from the experiences of those who have attained the highest 
degrees of skill that the only way in which to get to these very 
high stages is to force one’s self. Forcing is not to be recom- 
mended if one is ill, or too nervous, or if he needs quiet, rest, 
and recreation to get him out of a rut or to remedy his having 
become stale. But granted a good healthy condition, to attain 
the highest stages of proficiency, only one thing will serve, 
namely, forcing. The learner must put forth his very best 
efforts, without forgetting, however, that short periods of this 
great effort are undoubtedly best, and that the best methods must 
be used. 
Colvin, in The Learning Process, very well summarizes the 
facts in connection with this matter of effort. He writes: 
“The value of putting forth a maximal effort to gain a permanent 
improvement has been emphasized, particularly by Bryan 
and Harter, who say: ‘One conclusion seems to stand out from 
all these facts more clearly than anything else, namely, that in 
learning to interpret the telegraphic language, it is the intense 
effort that educates.’ Swift, while agreeing with this conclusion 
in general, adds the caution that spurts cannot be relied on to 
accomplish this result. The effort must be sustained, not spo- 
radic and haphazard. Book emphasizes the fact that a balance 
must be preserved between accuracy and speed. The imper- 
fectly formed habits must be mastered before substantial 
progress can be made. They should be acquired as rapidly as 
possible, but not so rapidly that speed shall be gained at the 
expense of accuracy, ‘The desire to hurry on must be nicely 
balanced with due caution.’” 1° 
The effort to get to the highest efficiency may need to con- 
tinue not only months but years. In the higher stages of expert-
-P-A-G-E-115
  PLATEAUS AND HINDRANCES TO PROGRESS 115- 
¥ 
ness a little improvement often means that a man is many 
times more valuable in his line of work; this little improvement 
in the advanced stages may mean that a man is worth several 
thousand dollars more than formerly in his business. 
The Limit of Improvability—There is a point above which 
there are only diminishing returns for one who tries to reach 
a higher degree of expertness, and this point one must decide 
very largely for himself; some can go farther than others with 
profitable returns for the investment of time and energy; others 
reach their limits of profitable returns earlier. The demands of 
different individuals also make it advisable for each to determine 
the degree of expertness in any particular line he needs for his 
own best service. Let it be said again, however, that most of 
us can improve far beyond our expectation if we only go about it 
rightly and keep persistently at it. In the problems and experi- 
ences of the expert one finds much that is closed to the student 
who goes only the little way that most people go; on the highest 
levels of endeavor one can find the keenest intellectual pleasure 
and the best and most lasting satisfaction.

  CHAPTER 10 
MEMORIES AND THE PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 
The Modern Conception of Memory.—The modern concep- 
tion of memory leads us to think of it as a form of habit;%* 
the recall of facts in memory is brought about in much the same 
manner as all habitual response. In other words, the making 
of memories makes at the same time dispositions in the nervous 
system, opens certain paths of discharge, and the more practice, 
the more easily and certainly will these paths, these dispositions, 
act or function again as they functioned before if only the right 
stimulus comes along. 
Memory is commonly thought of as being a “storehouse” of 
ideas. But, if we wish to hold to that gross notion, we must 
remember two facts; first, that memories change by subtraction, 
dropping out of details; a memory is not as full or accurate a 
few days or weeks after the learning as at first, and, second, that 
memories change by addition; addition from later experiences, 
perceptions and other memories, and also from the creative 
imagination. The psychology of testimony gives us ample illus- 
tration of both kinds of change. The ‘‘storehouse” idea is, 
then, misleading. |Memorizing is practice for recall; learning a 
skillful act is also practice for recall; the first being recall of | 
nervous activities which reinstate with greater or less accuracy 
the ideas desired; the second being the recall of nervous activities 
which bring about the desired actions. 
Another fact is that the term memory itself is likely to be 
misleading. We have many memories, or many kinds of mem- 
ories, and that is a fundamental fact that should be kept in 
mind. Psychology has not far to look for proof of the existence 
of many memories. The successful business man may have 
good memories for many kinds of things, but he frequently has a 
good memory for his line of work and miserably poor memories 
for other things; students who have memorized a great deal of 
one kind of material, do not find a corresponding improvement of 
117
-P-A-G-E-118
    118 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
ability in memorizing other kinds of material; pathological cases 
show loss of one kind of memory while the other memories remain 
unchanged. We have, then, not memory, but many memories. 
cjyvThe Conditions of Memory. —The secrets of good memories 
Shave been partly revealed in the preceding chapters. For the 
way to get the best results in memory is to have the right con- 
ions for study and study according to the best methods. As 
it puts it, ‘Do not try to improve your memory. Try to 
learn better.” 
All the conditions which we can name for attention and for 
observation are also conditions of memory and help to determine 
what and how well we shall remember. Attention is a prime 
condition of memory. The factors that determine attention, 
are, then, determinants of memory so far as they function. (See 
chapters on Stimulation.) 
In like manner all the factors that make for the right feelings 
make also for memory: the arousal of instinctive tendencies, 
curiosity, emulation, etc., the suggestion that brings the right 
set or mood, the control of bodily conditions and action, acquiring 
pleasing or valuable knowledge, having a purpose, a determina- 
tion, and especially an intention to remember. 
Association is the grouping of impressions, and the primary 
law, so called, of association is that conscious processes are likely 
to recur with those conscious processes with which they earlier 
appeared; given, that is to say, any conscious process, as it 
appears, any or all processes that were earlier associated with it 
are likely to appear. But it must be remembered that they may 
have been together under any one of many different circum- 
stances,—with attention or with inattention, clearly or vaguely, 
for a long time or for the briefest moment, on only one occasion 
or at a number of times. These other factors, besides the mere 
being together, are also factors that determine our memories. 
Mere association would not necessarily make for retention. 
Ability to recall depends upon the conditions under which the 
association are made. 
These conditions indicate what are called the secondary laws 
of association of which the following are the most important: 
(some have already been mentioned but are included in the 
following list) attention, feelings, emotional impressiveness, 
‘‘will,”’ want or need, feeling of social pressure, frequency of 
repetition, duration of the stimulus, vividness, recency, primacy,
-P-A-G-E-119
  MEMORIES AND PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 119 
age, regularity, number of previous connections, order of learn- 
ing, distribution of time, nature of material, divisions of 
material, length of material, logical connection, rhythm, warming 
up period, hardening period, fatigue, physiological conditions, 
habits, individual differences, number of senses involved,—all 
are given as determinants of memory. 
Vividness, Frequency of Repetition, Duration, Recency, and 
Primacy.—Attention and feeling disposition are prime conditions 
of good memory; so are the factors of vividness, frequency of 
repetition, duration, recency and primacy of impression. It 
needs no argument or example to prove that vividness of impres- 
sion means greater likelihood of retention; emotional impressive- 
ness, pleasantness or unpleasantness, the whole feeling reaction, 
may be important solely for the vividness of impression which 
accompanies it. It is a question how many of the other factors 
mentioned could not be reduced to a matter of vividness. We 
shall discuss them separately. 
Frequency of Repetition.—The law most commonly recognized 
and most frequently relied upon is that of frequency of repetition; 
it is pretty certain that if a thing is repeated a sufficient number 
of times it_wil e some impression. What is said later about 
the presence of the intention to remember, indicates the limita- 
tion of this law however. Drill work in the schools which was 
once very popular became less so as teachers began to emphasize 
the need of the pupil’s understanding everything he learned. 
But experiments have shown that while the understanding is 
very important, the repetition is also important, and drill is 
rightly becoming fashionable again. Again, let us say; under- 
standing is an immense aid in memorizing. But it has not proved 
to take the place of frequency of repetition. 
he duration of any impression naturally has much the same 
ct in deepening an impression. Thoughts aroused by a 
hasty skimming of the daily paper, the hundred and one ideas 
that flit through the mind in the course of the day, are generally 
doomed to an early oblivion. But the ideas that are held until 
they are once clear, the thoughts that are turned over in the mind, 
are impressed_and associated with other thoughts, and are pro- 
portionately more likely to be remembered. 
An Accumulation of Repetitions—Meumann has made a 
careful summary of facts in connection with an accumulation 
of repetitions and we cannot do better than quote his conclu-  
-P-A-G-E-120
  120 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
sions: ‘“‘What is the effect,’ he asks, “ofan accumulation of 
repetitions of any give material? Let us assume that a 
material which, so far as its amount i¢-concerned, can be learned 
perfectly well at a single sitting is learned until it can be repeated 
once from memory. What now is the effect of additional repeti- 
tion? . . . According to the experiments of Ebbinghaus the 
extra repetitions gradually become less and less effective so that, 
for instance, a dispropgrtionately large number of repetitions must 
be employed in order not only to attain the first recitation from 
memory, but to imprint the material so indelibly upon memory 
that it can be repeated without error at the end of twénty-four 
hours, or can be retained permanently. This observation was, in 
general, confirmed by Weber and by Knors; but these investigators 
alsoshow that a process of learning which has been continued only 
to the point where a first recitation from memory is just barely 
possible does not by any means guarantee a complete mastery 
or a permanent retention. Many additional repetitions are 
still necessary before a lasting retention is attained. It is 
clearly evident that immediate reproduction is a potent factor 
even in this process of ‘first correct recitation.’” 
Continuing, Meumann writes: “Certain important rules for 
the practice of teaching may be derived from the foregoing. 
“1, The mere act of learning a material until it can barely 
be reproduced never secures a permanent retention in the case 
of nonsense material of considerable bulk, even up to ten or 
twelve syllables; in the case of significant material it very seldom 
secures a permanent retention. From this it follows: 
“2. That for everything which is to be retained permanently, 
a subsequent ‘freshening’ by means of additional repetitions is 
indispensible. It follows, too, 
“3. That we should not be content to regard the ability barely 
to recite it from memory as an indication that a material has 
been memorized. Really permanent retention or complete 
mastery demands many more repetitions for its achievement. 
We see here how important the factor of mechanical learning is 
for genuine memorial function. That which is to become an 
imperishable possession of memory,—not as a part of one’s 
systematized body of knowledge, but only as a datum of concrete 
cognition,—can be acquired only at the cost of many repetitions. 
“4, If we wish, at a single sitting, to learn a material so perfectly 
that it will be retained permanently we must devote an excessive
-P-A-G-E-121
    
MEMORIES AND PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 121 
number of repetitions to it; and even then the result, so far as 
permanent retention’ is concerned, will remain in doubt.” & 
Primacy and Recency.—‘/First impressions are_ lasting;” 
and other things being equal the most recent experience makes the 
deepest impression. We remember the first story in the old 
school reader, and carry away most clearly the ideas expressed 
by the last speaker. Other factors modify the working of these, 
of course. Other laws of memory are working at the same time. 
For example, the first impression is likely fo determine the feeling 
disposition. But the most recent impressions, on the other hand, 
have the advantage of being left without interference by succeed- 
ing impressions. Both laws, primacy and recency, are exceed- 
ingly important. Each may be disturbed by the other, or by still 
other laws. 
The teacher may of course take advantage of several laws 
in the presentation of material. That material which he specially 
wishes to be remembered he may present at the outset, thus 
taking advantage of primacy, he may refer to it several times 
during the presentation, thus having repetition, and in conclusion 
he may bring this material together in a summary so as to take 
advantage of the law of recency. 
Distribution of Repetitions.—The time element enters into the 
learning in other ways than those already indicated. Jost’s 
law, as already indicated, stated that ‘Of two associations which 
are of equal strength but of different ages, the older receives 
the greater intensification from a new repetition.”’ That is to say, 
the older memory can be relearned more quickly if it has faded. 
The practical significance of this law is, for example, if one 
has to memorize material that will take approximately six 
hours, he should divide the time, and thus give an opportunity 
to make associations at different periods, which means the oppor- 
tunity of refreshing older impressions. The same law indicates 
one of the reasons for having children learn many valuable things 
early in life, the earlier the better. 
Besides the advantage of having older associations to 
strengthen by this division of study periods, there is another 
in the activity that continues during the intervals between 
study. Improvement is often found at the beginning of study 
periods which points to the making of progress during the 
intervals; the nature of the activities that bring about this prog- 
ress is not definitely known. Perhaps the learning processes  
-P-A-G-E-122
  
  122 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
actually continue after one stops the studying. Perhaps, and 
what is more likely, partly formed bad habits tend to drop out, to 
be weakened or lost during the intervals of practice. In this way 
inhibitions or interferences are eliminated. 
Reviews and the Division of Time.—Reviews are important 
for preparation for advanced work, they are important when 
one is preparing for an examination that covers a term’s or a 
year’s work. One of my advanced students who has taught 
history for a number of years found that the surest way to get 
her pupils through the state examinations was to organize the 
work so that the most important things recurred systematically 
and were thus reviewed several times during the course. This 
teacher tells me that the suggestion came from another instructor 
and proved so successful that, whereas, her pupils formerly often 
failed in the state examinations, she now succeeded in preparing 
as many as forty pupils and with not a single failure in the 
examinations. 
In preparation for advanced work, probably the best method 
for the student is to go through the previous notes or text or 
both and mark the things that need to be reviewed. Then the 
student should concentrate on these things until they are thor- 
oughly learned. 
Experimental Study of the Value of Reviews for a Short 
Assignment.—In a preliminary study the author has made experi- 
ments with sixth, seventh and eighth grade, high, and normal 
school students, to discover the relative value of 614 vs. 4 plus 
214 minutes study of a page of difficult history, a page of easier 
history, and a page of introduction to the metric system. Four- 
teen classes were tested. Each class was divided into a review 
and a non-review group. The review groups studied a page of 
history mimeographed, for 4 minutes, then wrote what they could 
remember for exactly 12 minutes. Later they reviewed for 214 
minutes. The non-review groups studied for 614 minutes at one 
time and then wrote for exactly 12 minutes. In some experi- 
ments the non-review groups studied at the same time that the 
review groups studied. In some experiments they studied when 
the review groups had their review. In this way the factor of 
recency was checked up. Both groups were later given an exami- 
nation at the same time. The groups were divided on the basis 
of scholarship according to school grades. Fourteen experiments 
were made with fourteen different classes. In all there were
-P-A-G-E-123
  MEMORIES AND PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 123 
730 cases. Experiment 1 was done with a page of history that 
was too difficult. Experiments 2-9 were done with an easier 
page of history. Experiments 10-14 were on the metric system. 
In experiments 1-3 the review groups had the advantage of 
recency. In all other experiments the review groups reviewed 
at the same time the non-review groups studied so that neither 
groups had the advantage of recency. 
“The average superiority of the review groups in the first 
three experiments where the review groups had the advantage 
of recency is 93 per cent. The average superiority in the other 
experiments is\67 per cent., and if we eliminate experiment 12, 
it is just less than 30 per cent. The extreme result in the 
twelfth experiment is due to the fact of several failures and near 
failures in the non-review group.”*4 (See Fig. 10.) The

Fig. 10.—The lower curve represents the non-review, the upper curve the 
review groups. Superiority of review groups in per cents. in experiments 1 to 14 
is as follows, respectively: 180, 79, 21, 17, 24, 22, 38, 14, 39, 50, 35, 440, 30, 27. 
experiments without exception show that the division of time so 
as to allow a short review period is valuable. It is generally 
known that the division of time for large amounts of material 
is very important. As suggested in the article just quoted, it 
may be that the value of reviews is directly proportional to the 
difficulty of the learning. 
The “Warming Up’’ Period.—The division of time involves 
other factors: the “warming up” period, the “hardening” period, 
and fatigue. The nervous system works very much like a 
machine. If one watches a lathe as the turner begins work 
in the morning, one notices that after the belt is thrown on 
the lathe starts, gathers speed, and is soon going merrily. After 
a moment or two the observer notices a continuing increase of
-P-A-G-E-124
  124 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
speed; the machine is getting ‘‘warmed up” and for the first 
few minutes does not attain its greatest speed. So with the 
nervous system and mental activity: the first few minutesdo 
not give the best results, and a study period should be long 
enough to allow taking advantage of the warming period. 
Fatigue.—At the other end of the study period there is the 
factor of fatigue. This, as has been said, is to be distinguished 
from weariness or the feeling of fatigue. This feeling is not 
an index of actual fatigue; the feeling may come prematurely 
on account of lazy habits of stopping long before one is really 
tired, or, if frequently disregarded when one is working long 
hours, perhaps with insufficient sleep, the feeling may fail to 
appear and be a warning against overwork. Experiment 
shows that the time during which the same quantity and quality 
of work can be sustained can be lengthened greatly over what 
is commonly believed. Eight, ten and twelve hours have been 
tried successfully, for example, in multiplication work. 
This does not prove, however, that very long hours of study 
are the most economical and best in the long run for study or 
for health. The fact is that fatigue lowers the quality and 
lessens the quantity of work and is to be avoided. The fact is, 
also, that work for fairly long periods is less harmful than has 
been supposed, and that a good deal of the injury attributed 
to work and study is the result of poor bodily conditions, insuffi- 
cient fresh air, sleep, exercise, proper food, and the presence of 
abnormal emotional states. In fact, one way to improve the 
memory is to improve the physical conditions. 
The “Hardening’’ Period.—It has further been found that one 
can take advantage of what has been termed the “hardening” 
period. This is the period immediately following a study 
period. If, during a few minutes directly after study, one lets 
his mind dwell on the subject of study, permits no distractions, 
no other thoughts to come, does not turn his attention to some 
other topic, the things learned will have a chance to sink in, 
so to speak; interference with the ideas will be avoided; the 
associations just made will not be broken up. Three or four 
minutes may very profitably be used as a hardening period. 
The Value of Comparatively Short Periods.—Experiment has 
shown us more in regard to the division of time. Economy 
requires avoidance of fatigue, elimination of the over long 
study period; economy may also be gained under some circum- 
4    
-P-A-G-E-125
  MEMORIES AND PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 125 
stances, at least, by the use of very short periods. In memo- 
rizing non-sense syllables, Ebbinghaus found that for later 
learning, thirty-eight repetitions distributed over three days were 
better than sixty-eight repetitions in one sitting. Jost, using 
non-sense syllables and making experiments with three divisions 
of time found two repetitions a day for twelve days best, four 
repetitions a day for six days, next best, and eight repetitions a 
day for three days poorest. Starch, requiring the association 
of letters with numbers and the transposing of grouped numbers

into prose, reports ten and twenty minute periods of practically 
the same value, the former slightly better. A forty minute 
period considerably poorer than either and a two hour period 
poorest. (See Fig. 11.) 
Dearborn”! with the same kind of material and problem, 
found that one ten minute period was better than two five 
minute periods per day. Pyle®® has experimented with adults 
in the learning of alphabet characters. He found that 30 
minutes a day gave better results than 15, 45, or 60 minutes. 
He concludes that the second practice on the same day is not 
as valuable as the first, and that after a few practices, further
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
practice on the same day is useless. In learning to run the 
typewriter the results were somewhat different. In the acquisi- 
tion of skill in this experiment Pyle found that concentrated 
practice,—about 5 practices the first day,—was economical. 
Later on the distributed practice again proved to be most 
economical. *! 
It is generally dangerous to draw conclusions from one kind 
of material to another. But it appears that for many kinds of 
material, at least, fairly short periods are not only economical, 
but far better than longer periods. Experience and experi- 
ment seem to show that for the working out of ideas, solving 
problems, writing essays, and the like, longer periods may not 
only be better but that they may be absolutely necessary. 
Immediate and Permanent Retention. Many Associations.— 
The factors that make for immediate retention for a first accurate 
recitation, for example, great concentration of effort for a short 
time, many repetitions during one sitting, do not make in the 
same way for permanent retention. While a thing may be 
learned for immediate recall by great effort and vividness of 
impression, psychologists have no two opinions in regard to the 
need for many associations with the thing to be remembered if 
it is to be long retained. Thatis to say the materiat to be 
remembered for a long time must be assimilated, it must find 
its place in the thinking of the student. It must be gone over 
again and again, and this means time, and better yet, distributed 
time; time divided into different periods as has just been shown. 
It is just this going over day after day, this using at frequent 
intervals that makes permanent and sure the recall of facts 
by the teacher, the business man, the doctor, the man in any 
line of work. Constant use means frequent repetition and many 
associations and as a result permanent acquisitions. If one 
realizes the thousands of impressions made through the eye 
and ear and the other senses in the course of only one hour, it 
will be seen that it is extremely valuable that the individual 
soon forget most of the impressions that are made only once. 
For the course of his thoughts would otherwise be continually 
disturbed with worthless memories constantly usurping the 
place of useful information and relevant thinking. It is again 
extremely valuable that the things gone over again and again 
are the things that become permanent for these are the things 
useful in every day life.
-P-A-G-E-127
  MEMORIES AND PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 127 
Cramming.—Cramming, it will now be seen, becomes a 
matter of making impressions which will last only a short time, 
for the failure to go over again and again, to review at different 
periods, means a lack of associations, a lack of assimilation, and 
hence, a lack of permanency. Cramming therefore fails for 
retention that is to last any great length of time. But cramming, 
on the other hand, is not to be condemned for other purposes. 
Some material is valuable only for a short time; furthermore 
some professions demand the ability to cram; the lawyer, the public 
speaker, the business man, the actor, all are required to learn a 
fairly large number of facts at short notice; very often this 
knowledge need not be remembered for a long time. The 
ability to cram is, therefore, a valuable asset; this the student soon 
learns,—to his delight, if he is able to do it well and wishes to 
pass an examination,—to his sorrow, if he hopes to retain the 
information after the examination. 
The student, then, must choose: either to depend on cramming, 
and to find that, outside the good or bad results of the examina- 
tion, all that he has left is the ability to cram: or to take more 
time, to review at different times, to form the necessary associa- 
tions and have a surprising amout of information when he gets 
through. Cramming is after all neither good nor bad, but like 
almost everything, it is good for some purposes, and inadequate 
for others; the ability to cram is likely to be a valuable asset to 
anyone. It is possible to learn to cram for more permanent 
retention. The determination to remember permanently; think- 
ing over the material as much as possible and early and frequent 
reviews make for permanent retention. 
t is worth noting that inability to recall immediately indi- 
cates poor observation, imperfect impressions, and the student 
who finds this kind of difficulty needs practice in observation. 
Inability to recall after a lapse of time indicates a defect in mem- 
ory, and the student here needs practice in memorizing the kind 
\.of material which he wishes to remember. 
Memory is no sure index of general intelligence; people of 
low intelligence often show astonishing memories, and can 
sometimes repeat accurately without hesitation more than one 
has patience to hear. On the other hand memory is funda- 
mental to reasoning, inasmuch as memory furnishes the material 
for reasoning; neither is great learning an index of ability to use 
that knowledge, and we often find the great student unable to
-P-A-G-E-128
    128 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
use his knowledge, whereas the man with a few facts and ability 
to put them into operation, to make the applications, steps in 
and achieves the success. 
The Rate of Learning.—The old statement that quick learners 
are correspondingly quick to forget has been denied; and evidence 
has been brought forward to show that students who learn fastest 
also remember the best; we are told that fast learners are at no 
disadvantage. It seems most probable that two types of learners 
have been observed: one in which learning is fast and retention 
superior; another in which the learning is fast and retention 
inferior. There is no room for doubt that there are fast and slow 
learners; in the face of evidence available during the last few 
years it must be believed that many fast learners remember as 
well as, or better than slow learners. 
The problem for any individual student is to find his own 
best rate; and excepting those who skim over their books with 
a superficial rapidity, it is for most people true that their rate 
of study could and should be a little faster than it generally is. 
A little extra pressure, desire to beat the other fellow, some- 
thing that gets us more solidly to work, frequently helps us to 
a speedier learning of a lesson which generally is learned lazily 
and not so well. The only way to find one’s own best rate of 
study is to try out different rates and choose the rate that gives 
the best results. 
But it is to be understood that fre rate of learning at the 
beginning of a task is not the ratd which is best later when 
some progress has been made. Understanding requires a slower 
rate at first; accuracy is the essential in the beginning, for the 
understanding of tegtesl material memorizing, the learning of a 
skillful act, or what not. The work should go slowly enough 
for accuracy; speed can and should come later. The later study 
can be faster and should be; if as slow as at first, interes may lag 
and effort wane. 
Meumann considers the rate of learning ‘‘the most universal 
and fundamental condition of memorial activity work because 
the tempo of learning determines the time during which not 
only the single syllable remains in consciousness and is imprinted 
upon consciousness, but also the rapidity with which the associa- 
tions between the several syllables are formed.” Learning 
at a very fast rate is bad; learning at a very slow rate is bad; there 
is a loss either way, and the student if he is to do his best work
-P-A-G-E-129
  MEMORIES AND PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 129 
with the best economy must find his own best rate of study, first 
for the material he is studying, second, for the stage of progress 
he has already made with this material, and third, for the problem 
he has before him, whether to understand, to memorize, or to 
learn a skillful act. 
Auditory learning is faster than visual learning; if one learns 
through the eye, one must then expect to go a bit slower, but 
there is the satisfaction of knowing that the visual learning is 
more accurate. 
Regularity of Application—The continual dropping of water 
wears away stones; regular application to a subject will remove 
mountains. It is not too much to say that twenty minutes a 
day for a year would be sufficient for a fair student to learn the 
fundamentals of a science. This means regularity, and it is the 
regular application day after day, week after week, month after 
month that counts. The spasmodic effort just before an exami- 
nation serves, perhaps, for the immediate occasion, but for that 
only. The superhuman effort for a short time overtaxes the 
system, and gives only indifferent results with a very dispropor- 
tionate expenditure of time and energy. 
The regular, systematic, accomplishment is the true way to 
success; this is the insuring of habits, and habits, if well formed, 
are as sure as anything that a man can rely upon. It is because 
of this regularity more than anything else that men awake 
suddenly to the realization of competency in their field. It is 
this which brings mastery; and when it comes one knows that he 
has command of that which has thus been practiced regularly; 
it is a part of him, and remains a part of him as long as his nervous 
system continues to work normally. 
Frequency of Practice.—Is it most economical to practice 
for a certain length of period once a day, once every other day, 
twice a week, or several times a day? Granted the value 
of regularity, what is the best distribution of periods? The 
problem is very important especially in connection with the 
determination of the curriculum for schools and _ colleges. 
Very commonly we find students studying according to either 
one of two plans: the five times a week plan, or the alternate 
day plan. 
The study of Murphy” perhaps sums up the larger part 
of our experimental information on the subject. We have 
spoken elsewhere of the value of distribution of periods, Of
-P-A-G-E-130
ee 
130 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
this there is no doubt. We have only begun to get answer to 
the question of the best distribution. 
Murphy tells us: ‘In regard to periods of work up to a limit 
of twenty or thirty minutes, the conclusion has been reached 
that one practice period per day gives better results than any 
other larger number per day. Lashley (in an unpublished 
study) found in archery practice that the group which made 
five shots per day showed greater improvement for the same 
number of shots than those who made twenty shots of forty 
shots per day. 
“As yet no conclusion has been reached in regard to the value 
of alternate days’ practice compared with daily practice. Pyle, 
from his experiments in transcribing reading matter into new — 
characters, concluded that daily practice is better than practice 
on alternate days. He had, however, only six subjects in the 
test, and even to this conclusion, he adds that after the initial 
stages alternate days may be better. 
“Professor Leuba and Miss Hyde of Bryn Mawr have added 
some information to this question in their tests on ‘Hand 
Movements.” Their test was to find out the progress in skill 
in writing English prose in German script. Four divisions 
were made of their subjects: One group working twice per day 
one daily, one on alternate days, and another every third 
day” . . . thereis seen “‘very little difference between the alter- 
nate and daily practice groups, but in comparing them with 
other groups a decided showing is found in favor of the daily 
and alternate day groups. One defect in this comparison is 
the short length of the curve. The indications are that with 
further practice the alternate group would compare yet more 
favorably . . . at the end of the tenth trial the group working 
on alternate days was superior.” 
Professor Murphy gives the result of his own experiments in 
javelin throwing. Three groups of Normal School girls using 
the left hand, practiced throwing the javelin; one group throw- 
ing five times a week, another three times a week, the third 
once a week. Some attention was also given to twice a day 
practice. Professor Murphy states in conclusion that, ‘Frome 
a study of the results of the above experiment, and from a 
careful study of the attitude of those throwing the javelin, we 
conclude that learning periods can be distributed by giving 
alternate days practice, and even weekly practice, without any” 
loss in learning. We believe this to be a conservative statement  
-P-A-G-E-131
  MEMORIES AND PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 131 
not only for practice periods involving skill or hand manipulation 
but also for so-called mental work. We believe we are justified 
in stating that better work, for the amount of time expended, 
can be done in our schools through a distribution of three times 
per week than through a distribution of five times per week.” 
While there is apparently considerable economy in relatively 
longer intervals between practice periods, it is perhaps wise to 
await further study and to be especially careful about generalizing 
from one kind of learning to another. 
QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY 
1. Explain how the old view of ‘‘memory”’ is supplanted by the modern 
view of ‘‘memories.”’ Give reasons for this change of view. 
2. How may the “‘storehouse”’ idea of memory be misleading? In what 
sense may it be correct? 
3. ‘The nervous modification which we have here named ‘impression’ 
is, clearly, the first term in the series of nervous changes which con- 
dition the process of learning.”’ Discuss this statement and show how 
much that we have said in earlier chapters is significant for the per- 
manence of retention. 
4. “The conditions of impression are also the conditions of association.” 
Can we conclude from this fact that we should try to make the con- 
ditions of learning as nearly as possible the same as the conditions that 
will be present when we want to recall? 
“§. Make a list of the factors that you consider most valuable in the school 
room for the purpose of helping students to retain what.they study.

something to a class. Choose the subject and the factors you would use 
and show how you would use them.

  CHAPTER 11 
MEMORIES AND THE PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 
(Concluded) 
The Nature of Material—The nature of material and its 
organization or lack of organization make an immense dif- 
ference in learning and in retaining. Organization is immensely 
valuable both for mastery and for subsequent recall. A speaker 
finds it easy to remember his address if he has organized it 
logically; the audience finds that such a talk can be reported 
with comparative ease; but let it be put together in a disorderly 
way and both speaker and hearers find proportionate difficulty 
in remembering even the main ideas. The teacher who can 
lecture hour after hour with comparatively little dependence on 
notes owes his readiness of recall very largely to the fact that the 
ideas have been organized. When one has this organization of 
a science in mind, whatever he studies finds its appropriate 
place in his system of thought, and is so much the more likely 
to be remembered. 
It follows for the student, then, that if the material which 
he studies is not properly organized, he should organize it for 
himself. It is conceivable that the organization of material 
could be done by a few very good students without written notes; 
but this method is bound to fail in many details if not with 
many of the main thoughts; this is especially true of things learned 
through lecture. If one can listen to a lecture, understand it, 
and afterwards find what he is unable to remember in a textbook 
sufficiently well organized, it is probably the best way to do. 
But the essential thing is to have the material organized and to 
have it so that it can be reviewed. Once going over a thing is 
not sufficient. 
Topical Study.—Topical study and topical organization are 
undoubtedly the best; know first the general subject, next the 
first main thought and the subheads under it with illustrations: 
then the next main thought and the subheads and illustrations 
under each, and so on. The subheads may be arguments for 
or against, examples, explanations, applications, or whatever 
132

  MEMORIES AND PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 133 
else belongs with that main thought. We think by topics, we 
use, answer questions, solve problems, index our knowledge by 
topics; and for all these purposes and in practically all cireum- 
stances the topical method of study and of organization is best. 
Light from Later Chapters.—It is obvious that some material 
can be mastered as one goes along and that other material is 
so difficult that one finds it either very hard or impossible to 
master in this way. For skillful acts, habits need to be made 
thoroughly before higher habits, that is, habits dependent upon 
the fundamental habits, can be made economically. On the 
other hand, common experience shows that what is not under- 
stood or well remembered may be cleared up and easily fixed 
in memory when later paragraphs are read, or after later chapters 
are studied: later statements throw light on earlier ones. 
It is a common experience for students to find on review for 
examination that many parts of a course which were not at all 
clear earlier become perfectly clear through the review, and 
furthermore, the different facts find their proper place, appear 
in the true perspective in the student’s mind. To go ahead 
and get light and then to review is, with much meaningful 
material, often the thing todo. This suggests naturally enough 
the problem of learning by the whole or part or by some other 
method, and the further problem of the size or amount of the 
units to be learned at any one time. 
The Whole versus the Part Method.—Experiments give us 
considerable evidence in connection with the first question. 
The most common way to learn a poem or a speech is to learn 
a part, then another part, and so forth, until the entire poem 
or speech is learned. The results of experiments show that in 
comparison with the method of learning by going from beginning 
to end and repeating the process till the learning is complete, 
learning by parts is wasteful of time and energy. Learning by 
wholes is more economical than learning by parts. The possible 
exception to this rule is found with non-sense syllables which have 
been used in experiments; there is little or none of this kind of 
memorizing in real life however, and furthermore, there is reason 
to believe that a modification of the whole method is best even 
with this kind of material. 
Meumann has reported the results of his own experiments 
and of the experiments of others. The results, in which there 
is general agreement, are as follows: “For adults and children  
-P-A-G-E-134
  134 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
it ismore advantageous and it is psychologically and pedagogically 
more appropriate to learn every sort of material as a whole 
than to break it up into parts:”—‘ If, for example, an observer 
remembers thirty per cent. of a poem which he learned three 
months ago by the whole procedure, he would be found to have 
forgotten almost the whole of it during the same interval if he 
had learned it by the part procedure. Indeed, it sometimes 
happened, it is true, that stanzas which had been learned by the 
whole procedure required more repetitions on relearning than 
stanzas learned by the part procedure; but, even in those cases, 
the former stanzas were remembered essentially better than the 
latter. Hence, the whole method again proves to be more 
advantageous in so far as retention for longer periods of time is 
concerned.” 
Again he writes: “‘I have discovered that the whole procedure 
is advantageous not only in the laboratory but in practice, for 
teachers of my acquaintance have submitted it to a thorough 
test in their schools. Let the children see how wholly different 
is their concentration of attention when they learn by means of 
the whole method or by one of the mediating methods, and how, 
in employing the part method as they ordinarily do, they waste - 
an extravagant number or repetitions on the first few lines of a 
stanza of poetry and neglect the other lines.’”’®* The conclusions 
stated above were based on studies of memorizing non-sense 
syllables and poetry. 
Miss Lakenan compared the whole and part methods in con- 
nection with both prose and poetry. She writes: ‘‘ For memoriz- 
ing poetry, the whole method is, in general, more economical 
than the part method. In cases where the part method was of 
advantage for the first learning, the percentage retained after 
a number of months was greater for material learned by the whole 
method than for that learned by the part method; prose is 
more readily learned and better retained by means of the whole 
method than by the part; for both poetry and prose there is an 
increase in effectiveness of the whole method with increase in 
the length of the selection to be learned, up to 36 lines of poetry 
and 300 words of prose, which were the limits of the experiments 
. most children tested found the whole method of advantage 
for the first learning.’’®* 
Reasons offered in explanation of the advantage of the whole 
method are numerous: better distribution of attention and effort;
-P-A-G-E-135
  MEMORIES AND PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 135 
realization of meaning of the whole; consequent better interest 
and sustained effort; avoidance of transition from one section to 
another and the final putting them all together; having parts in 
right order and position from the beginning, and thus learning 
cues for succeeding parts from the outset; aid given by total 
impression. 
Modification of the Whole Method.—What Meumann calls 
the “mediating” method is a modification of the whole method. 
For example, a language vocabulary exercise is to be learned; 
the student goes through it from start to finish as required by 
the whole method; but he notes or marks the hard places and as he 
goes over the exercise in the following repetitions he allows the 
mind to dwell longer on the hard parts. This obviously combines 
the further factor of duration of impression. The term ‘“‘mediat- 
ing” is not sufficiently descriptive of the method designated: the 
expression, modified whole method, is at least more definite and 
might perhaps be most useful. 
Another modification of method is in the combination of the 
whole and part methods; this allows for individual differences. 
It has been used most successfully with school children. The 
material is first studied by the whole method; then the hard 
parts are studied by the part method; finally the entire matter 
is gone over by the whole method again. This also permits 
greater attention and the expenditure of more time and energy 
on the hard parts and proves to be most successful and economical 
in many situations. 
Size of Units.—As to the size of units, the amount of material 
to be studied by the whole method or by any other method, 
only partial answer has been given by psychological experiments. 
The results seem to differ with practiced and unpracticed observ- 
ers. Ebbinghaus found that with unpracticed observers larger 
amounts of material required a disproportionately large number 
of repetitions. With practiced observers an increase in the 
amount to learn does not require a proportionate increase in the 
number of repetitions needed for learning. The conclusion seems 
.to be that for unpracticed observers or learners, shorter units, 
and for better trained students longer units, are best. 
Meumann states on the basis of work done in his laboratory 
that “the task assigned for a single period must be as great as 
the capacity of the learner permits.’’® In defense of this he 
reports the following facts: syllables may be learned with a
-P-A-G-E-136
  136 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
certain number of repetitions, as for example, 8 in 5.2 repetitions; 
12 in 10.4; 16 in 17; 18 in 21.5; 24 in 30; 36 in 32.5 repetitions. 
Miss Lakenan reports: “In learning prose by the whole 
method, fewer repetitions are required for learning a 300 word 
selection than for learning a 100 or 200 word selection, while 
in learning prose by the part method there is a slight increase 
in the number of repetitions required with increase in the length 
of selection to be learned. In memorizing poetry, 36 lines require 
fewer repetitions for learning than do 18 lines, when the whole 
method is used. When the part method is used, there is an 
increase in the number of repetitions required for learning with 
increase in the length of the selections to be learned, with 
one exception,—36 lines require fewer repetitions than do 
27 lines.’’57 
Henmon found similarly with meaningful material that an 
increase in amount of material did not require a proportional 
increase in the number of repetitions. It is probable, there- 
fore, that economy is to be found in taking a fairly long task 
rather than a shorter one; just how long, psychologists are not 
ready to say; further experiments must be made; and when 
they are made, individual differences will probably make it 
very much an individual problem still; better students will 
find it economical to take longer amounts while poorer students 
will find it advisable to take smaller amounts to study at one 
time. Experience tells part of this, as, for example, the division 
of a play into acts is found to be the best. 
In this connection Meumann writes: ‘‘The slow increase in 
number of repetitions with increase in amount of material 
reveals the presence of a fact of will, and also perhaps of an 
attitude or adjustment, which may be described by the state- 
ment that the expenditure of energy is regulated automatically 
to conform with the magnitude of the achievement which is 
demanded of the learner. It is a matter of every-day obser- 
vation that our task progresses more readily when we make 
it part of a larger task than when we set about it independ- 
ently. Our awareness of the fact that the task is large leads us 
unconsciously and involuntarily to a keener and more effective 
concentration of our energies. I have found this phenomenon 
to occur in learning, in the work-curve, and even in ergo- 
graphic experiments, so that I am led to suppose that it may be 
a universal law of will.”

  MEMORIES AND PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 137 
Size of Units and the Length of Assignments.—The topical 
method of study and of assigning lessons permits of a solution 
to this problem. A topic or several topics are assigned. All 
students must learn a certain minimum about each topic. The 
better students are credited for all they learn in addition. Credit 
is also given for quality of work. Obviously the procedure 
requires a careful organization of the course. But no teacher 
should attempt to teach a course if it has not been well organized. 
Order of Learning.—Order of learning is akin to organization 
of material. The order of studying facts in a subject in a 
course in school or college, gives the basis for the organization 
of all the facts learned; on the basis of such order of learning 
and organization the material is most easily learned and best 
remembered. In physics, for example, it is likely that the funda- 
mental matters of time, space and mass should be studied first; 
then the phenomena arising from the combination of two of 
these; then the phenomena arising from the combination of all 
three; and, finally, the more complex phenomena which can be 
properly understood on the basis of these facts. This ordering 
of materials, the presentation of facts in the best sequence, is the 
problem of the teacher and of the author of the text-book; 
but the student should expect to find such presentation from the 
teacher and from the text-book. 
Silent Learning versus Learning Aloud.—Is it more economic 
to study silently or aloud? Dumville and Lewis** report that 
they found the silent method better for groups of children 
who learned poetry by the “entire” method. The groups 
using the silent method not only did better in reproduction 
but the individuals, evidently without exception liked the silent 
method better. 
Pintner and Gilliland®? report that groups which they studied 
showed better results when using the silent method. (See Fig. 
1.) Mead* reports that fifteen out of seventeen classes did better 
in reading by the silent method. Seventy per cent. of the children, 
aged 9.2 to 16 years, taken separately did better by this method. 
Explanations offered indicate that the silent method is con- 
sidered to allow better exercise of individual differences in such 
things as rate of learning, span of apprehension, difference 
in understanding words, kinds of associations, type of imagery, 
and that there is less distraction and better attention when this 
method is used.
-P-A-G-E-138
    138 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
We have yet to learn if a combination of the two methods 
would not give the best results. Dumville and Lewis think 
that the combination of a little concerted learning and the rest 
and by far the most of silent learning would in common prac- 
tice in schools give the best result. 
The Attitude of the Student.—When all is said the fact remains 
that all progress in learning depends on the activity of the student; 
and it depends on the text or the teacher only so far as the text 
or the teacher arouses this activity of the student. Ultimately 
all education depends on the activity of the learner, and the 
school or college can only arouse and help to direct this activity 
and make it economic. The teacher can offer the stimulus, the 
incentive. The attitude, the condition of the student, the way he 
goes to work, determine what he shall learn. In the field of 
memory the old illustration is pertinent. A baggageman deliv- 
ered a trunk to the wrong address while drunk and was unable to 
recall the place where he had left the trunk until he was again 
drunk. The point is that the conditions of learning are also 
the conditions of recall. The student should realize then that 
he should put himself in the same attitude when studying in 
which he will find himself when trying to recall; this means 
among other things, something of the aggressive attitude. 
Artificial Systems and Devices: Mnemonics.—The majority 
of students, teachers, business and professional men find that 
the logical organization and the continual use of their subject 
matter are not only sufficient for remembering their material 
but that these means are the most satisfactory; on the other 
hand, men with excellent memories find aid in the use of artificial 
systems or devices, in mnemonic systems or mnemonic devices. 
The railway postal clerk who has to memorize all the post-offices 
in three states, looks in vain for logical connection with such 
incorrigible material and rightly seeks aid in mnemonics. 
We have, in the first place, to recognize the fact that people 
for the most part do not make their memories serve them as 
they might; case after case could be cited of people who com- 
plained of poor memories, but found that a little demand in 
the way of practice revealed good or excellent memories. In 
the second place, people commonly hold to the notion that 
they can practice on one kind of material and as a result be 
better able to remember other kinds of material; failing in this 
they feel the need of an artificial cure-all. And, in the third  
-P-A-G-E-139
  
  MEMORIES AND PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 139 
place, the flight to an artificial system is a flight to a means of 
interpolating into the material to be learned the logical or 
other associations which the student should find within nearly 
all kinds of material itself. The justification of a mnemonic, 
therefore, so far as it can be justified at all, lies in its interpo- 
lating some kind of helpful association where there is none in 
the material itself. 
Disadvantages of Mnemonics.—This bringing in of some kind 
of association into discrete, incorrigible material is the advantage of 
mnemonics, and constitutes, so far as the author can see, its only 
defense. And the disadvantages are many. The logic that is 
used is often bad logic; one uses poor logic enough without train- 
ing in its use; the system is of little use unless it is fully mastered 
and continually used; this is likely to mean overuse, that is, 
use where it should not be resorted to, and therefore, a tendency 
away from relying on native memory and making it serve one as 
it should. It is obvious, too, that reliance on an artificial system 
may postpone or even eliminate the discovery of logical rela- 
tions within the material to be learned which the student should 
find if he is to have any mastery of his subject. 
Furthermore, any recall through the medium of mnemonics 
is slower because of the additional associations involved, and 
is correct only if the system has been used correctly. The 
mind has all this time of course the burden of the additional 
auxiliary ideas demanded by the system. The enthusiast is 
likely to overuse such a system at first; later to become dissat- 
isfied with it and to find it more a burden than a help. 
At best mnemonics is only an aid to memory and should 
never be substituted for ordinary memorizing; it should never 
be used except to supplement, and then only for material which 
cannot be dealt with in a better way. Its true use is, then, with 
very difficult discrete material and only as an occasional supple- 
mentary aid. {he little mnemonic devices arranged by teachers 
perform this office. 
Habit or Logic in Language.—Rules for correct pronunciation 
and for the cortect use of language are a sort of logical method 
language; and the teacher should learn once 
for all that knowledge of rules does not make much difference 
with the actual performance. A person speaks and writes 
correctly becausé he has heard and read and been called upon 
to use correct language. The direct method of teaching lan-    
   
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
guages recognizes this fact. Experimental pedagogy has 
shown us how little the knowledge of rules has to do with the 
correct use of language;®* and experience tells us that children 
can learn several languages if people around them use those 
languages. It is fairly safe to say that no one but a teacher 
and he very seldom thinks of a rule or makes any application of 
a rule in the use of language. ‘‘Grammar,” according to the 
recent report of the U. S. Bureau of Education,* “receives 
altogether too much time and is taught too intensively and too 
analytically.” 
Forgetting.—The facts of forgetting are very complex and 
confusing. Few generalizations can be made that apply to

different kinds of material. The rate of “forgetting and its 
extent differ as the material as well as the conditions of learning 
differ. It may be safe to say, however, that ‘forgetting is at 
first very rapid and that this decreases as time goes on. In 
some kinds of learning at least one retains or is able to repro- 
duce more at the end of twenty-four than at the end of eight 
hours after learning. 
The study of Radossawljewitsch is probably as representa- 
tive as any for the rate of forgetting non-sense syllables. These
-P-A-G-E-141
  MEMORIES AND PERMANENCE OF ACQUISITION 141 
were learned by 27 observers until they could reproduce them 
twice without error. The average results are as follows: 2.5 
per cent. were forgotten in 5 minutes; 11.4 per cent. in 20 minutes; 
29.3. per cent. in 60 minutes; 52.6 per cent. in 8 hours; 32.2 
per cent. in 1 day; 39.1 per cent. in 2 days; 50.7 per cent. in 6 
days; 59 per cent. in 14 days; 62.2 per cent. in 21 days; 79.8 per 
cent. in 30 days; 97.2 per cent. in 120 days. This is made clearer 
by the accompanying curve. (Fig. 12.) 
The forgetting of poetry seems to follow another curve, and 
this is represented in the second figure which again shows the 
faster forgetting at first and slower later. (Fig. 13.)

Permanence and the Kind of Learning.—Some of our acquisi- 
tions are without doubt much more permanent than others. 
Some are no doubt more likely to be permanent because of the 
nature of the learning or of the nature of the thing learned, or 
for both reasons. Thorndike makes the following statement 
in The Psychology of Learning: ‘‘It is perhaps the case that 
functions whose improvements consists in responding more 
surely and more quickly by some movements of the muscles 
to some sense presentations with which the former are to be 
bound with few intermediaries, retain their improvement better 
than functions where the surety and speed of bonds from one 
internally initiated event in the brain to another are the main 
facts to be improved. Skating, dancing, swimming, typewriting 
in an advanced stage, on the one hand, and the recital of poems, 
or non-sense series, knowledge of chemistry or geology, the ability
-P-A-G-E-142
  142 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
to translate English into German, and typewriting at the begin- 
ning, on the other, illustrate and suggest this contrast. 
“Tt is possible that the secondary or so-called higher 
connections in the nervous system which correspond to the 
association of ‘ideas’ are fundamentally less retentive of modifi- 
cation produced in them by learning than are the more primary 
‘and direct neural bonds which correspond to the association 
of sensory situation and motor response. Knowledge may 
be by the nature of man’s neurones less retainable than skill. 
Roughly, as a matter of general observation, it seems to be.”’ 11°

  CHAPTER 12 
ACQUISITION OF AFFECTIVE AND MORAL TRAITS 
Habit Extends to Feeling. —The instability that we commonly 
note in the life of the feelings may often lead us to doubt whether 
or not there is anything permanent in connection with our 
feelings. We are pleased with one thing one day and displeased 
with it the next. Something has satisfied us for weeks, but all 
of a sudden we decide that we are tired of it. 
On the other hand, we find ourselves saying that old friends 
are best. We turn back to the old accustomed authors and 
delight in the music with which we are familiar. In the emer- 
gencies of life we fall back upon the old customs and the old 
beliefs. In fact, when we depend upon what we consider the 
stability of a man’s character we depend upon what we believe 
or know to be his habitual way of acting in terms of certain 
sentiments of right and justice, etc. When we plan entertain- 
ments for our friends we plan in terms of what we know they like 
and are interested in. 
In the education of our children we are certainly hoping 
that we shall succeed in getting them to like and be satisfied 
only -with certain worthy and acceptable things and actions; 
and that they shall dislike and be dissatisfied with certain other 
unworthy and unacceptable things and actions. We hope 
that noble desires will become permanent, and ignoble desires 
will die out. Perhaps nowhere do our feeling habits appear 
more strikingly ingrained than in some such case as the way 
in which we like a certain chair, or place to read or study, or 
certain of our old haunts; or in what we term cravings, such 
as the craving for strong drink or tobacco, or the symphony 
if we have been accustomed to it and are deprived of it for a 
year or two. 
In the extremity we fly to the old beliefs. Through life we 
have the same old illogical fears that were implanted in child- 
hood. One child gets into the habit of flying into a rage if 
things cross him; it may be the severest struggle of adult life 
143
-P-A-G-E-144
  
  144 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
to control this habit and not fly into a rage. Another child is 
taught to be good natured and smile when he desires anything 
from his parents. It becomes the habit of his life. The child 
cares little for the classical music or literature but he hears it 
at home and at school. He may tire of it. Repetition may 
make him weary of it. But there is implanted in him an appetite, 
perhaps, a craving for it, which is a permanent acquisition. 
The Opposing Tendencies.—Here we seem to have a contra- 
diction; repetition blunts feelings but it also develops permanent 
desires, appetites, cravings, and the like. Sully has told us in 
this connection: “Our permanent surroundings and manner of 
life tend to grow indifferent, that is, to lose all or most of their 
affective concomitants. This applies at once to our pleasures 
and to our pains. Thus we get used, that is, comparatively 
indifferent, to surroundings, companions, lines of activity, which, 
when they were new, were highly enjoyable, or, on the other hand, 
particularly agreeable.”’ But, also, Sully writes: ‘“‘The process 
of organic adjustment or accommodation just referred to is less 
simple than we have supposed. Exercise tends to strengthen 
an organ, and is one main condition of organic growth. One 
important result of this is that stimuli, which were at first fati- 
guing and so painful, may with repeated application become pleasur- 
able. Thus an amount of muscle-work or brain-work, which is 
at first unpleasant, may with increase of functional power become 
enjoyable. Another effect tending to disguise the general decay 
of feeling is due to its increasing complication as experience 
advances and associations form themselves. In this way our 
friends, our books, and so forth, though losing some of their 
pristine charm, become endeared by associations. The action of 
association leads on to the influence of Habit in the domain of 
feeling. What remains with us, what we habitually see, and 
habitually do, while it loses its keen pleasurableness, generates 
through habit an attachment or clinging of mind which betrays 
itself whenever it is removed. Jennie Deans, feeling strange 
and lost in her London surroundings, and longing to get back 
to her familiar scenes, is an example of this effect. Every 
sudden rupture in our experience, as the loss of a familiar friend, 
shows the same force of custom in producing an attachment of 
mind. Here, then, we have an effect precisely the reverse of 
blunting. The older and more fixed the habit, the harder is it 
to bear the sundering of the bond. Habit is thus a fertile source
-P-A-G-E-145
  ACQUISITION OF AFFECTIVE AND MORAL TRAITS 145 
of negative pains, or the pains of craving, a source which grows 
more prolific as life advances.”!° Thus we see as Sully says 
in summary, “the principle of habit, which, though it tends, as we 
have seen to dull feeling, tends also indirectly to fix and further tt 
by strengthening the disposition to the appropriate motor reation. 
A child who is allowed to fall again and again into the mental and 
bodily attitude of anger contracts a stronger organic disposition 
to react in this way, a fact clearly seen in the greater rapidity of 
the outburst, and in the diminished strength of the stimulus 
requisite for calling it forth.’’!% 
Permanence in Connection with the Feelings.—The habitual 
in the world of feeling is indicated also in the following quotation 
from Professor Titchener: ‘‘The name of passion is also given 
to any abiding interest, to any mode of strong emotive response 
that is specific and lasting. We say that a man has a passion for 
success, for science, for gambling; and we mean that a situation 
which shows any sort of reference to these things will appeal to 
him, dominatingly and one sidedly, through that reference.”1!9 
Whatever we shall call these permanent or relatively permanent 
acquisitions in the world of feeling, we mean just these things 
that are called permanent interests, or cravings, or passions or 
sentiments; or such things as Titchener mentions when he says: 
“Other current usage identifies sentiment with what we have 
called passion (in the second sense), 7. e., with such things as love 
of power, of fame, or economy, of cleanliness; hatred of injustice, 
of oppression, of affectation; devotion to science, or art or reli- 
gion. It seems, however, more natural to speak of a passion for 
cleanliness, a passion for order, a passion for justice, a passion 
for old furniture, than to name these affective dispositions 
“sentiments.” 
Feelings and Action.—The important thing in connection 
with all this is that the student in the course of his education 
does acquire those tendencies to desire, crave, need, whatever 
you would call it, the things that are desirable, and to act so as 
to obtain them. Feelings and action of the appropriate kind 
should go together. And they should continue to act together as 
permanent tendencies. The feeling should not habitually 
fritter off and nothing come of it. To have the feeling alone 
would only be a luxury, and perhaps, as Thorndike says, a vice. 
From the practical point of view, we shall lose nothing if we 
talk in the everyday forms of speech and imply that the feel-
-P-A-G-E-146
  
  146 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
ings actually bring about actions. We can remember that 
they probably do not bring about the action, but that their 
presence indicates certain disposition and that the causal links 
lie wholly in the nervous system. 
The Feelings Dependent upon Action.—The actions are not 
so much the result of feelings, as the feelings are the result of 
actions. We accordingly find, granting the great influence of 
heredity, of course, that our actions settle for us our dispositions 
for this or that kind of activity. We act kindly, mercifully, 
justly, charitably, and we find the ideals of these things and the 
dispositions for them growing strong within us. We also find 
that these things satisfy us and the lack of them dissatisfies 
us. Not only has our living in a certain way developed our 
likes for this way of living, but it has also developed our dislikes 
for other ways, or ways that conflict with this. We have 
indicated here one of the fundamental things of which the educa- 
tor must take advantage in developing the feeling habits of 
pupils. Get him to act so that he will have the right feelings. Do 
not merely arouse the feeling. What one feels may be enjoyed 
merely as so much pleasure. One may have a thrill and wait 
expectantly for the next thrill, and the enjoying of the thrill 
be the sum and substance of the matter. On the other hand 
what we do we come to like; what we do we tend to think of as 
our activity with the emphasis on “our” and for that reason we 
are likely to defend it. Furthermore, the acting makes it a part 
of our nervous system. 
Associations.—The second great means of developing disposi- 
tions for things and activities lies in the associations that are 
or may be formed. Perhaps more than anything else, the reason 
that we like our native land, our own state, our own group, lies 
in the associations we have with them. You love one state and 
think of the sleigh rides, the skating, the canoeing, the friends, 
the weekend parties. I love another state and think of the 
same associations I have with that state. One man likes litera- 
ture and you find that he has had pleasant associations with 
the literature that he has studied. Another dislikes literature 
and you may find that he had unpleasant associations with it. 
Yes, you say, but it may be an hereditary difference. One is 
born to like one kind of thing and another to like something 
quite different. Yes, that isso. But it is only part of the truth. 
One man tells that he disliked a certain subject until he had a
-P-A-G-E-147
  ACQUISITION OF AFFECTIVE AND MORAL TRAITS 147 
certain teacher and forever after he enjoyed that subject. That 
is a matter of education and not of heredity. And it is a matter 
of associations. Even the disagreeable things of life conform to 
these laws. The business man may dislike his work but finally 
it becomes a necessity to his life. So the business man spends 
two weeks on a vacation and is glad to return again to his regular 
work. Many a man has retired from business and discovered 
that he was unhappy and discontented without the associa- 
tions and activities to which he had through long years become 
accustomed. 
The Development of Interests.—It is likely that we consider 
our interests to be more intellectual than our passions. If a 
man has an interest in a subject, he is correctly supposed to 
desire to attend to and think about it, to indulge himself in it 
consciously, not merely to satisfy a craving. “The secret of 
education,” wrote Adam Smith, “is to direct vanity to proper 
objects.”’8® Radestock tells us: ‘The celebrated pedagogue, 
T. Ziller, studied the importance of interest very minutely, and 
declares that instruction must particularly awaken and develop 
a wide and many sided interest in the objects taught and the 
mental labor, while the separate particles received may occasion- 
ally, without harm, fall a prey to forgetfulness. It is this wide 
and various interest that distinguishes the truly educated and 
mentally active person; and the increased interest in separate 
subjects causes him to be saved from distraction, notwithstanding 
a generous education, and enables him to use his concentrated 
efforts in separate fields.’’&4 
I have often asked teachers which they would prefer their - 
students to get from a course if they could get only one of two 
things, information on the one hand, or on the other, interest 
and a desire for more of the subject. The answer has always 
been interest and a desire for more. Fortunately one cannot 
teach a pupil anything so as to arouse an interest in it without 
also having information, be it ever so little, as part of the result. 
Part of the work of a teacher in any teaching is to inspire the 
pupil, to interest him, to arouse him, so that he will want more, 
so that he will have an abiding interest in the subject. 
Making Interests Permanent.—We shall discuss in a later 
place factors that may help to arouse interest and find a goodly 
number: appeal to instincts, pleasant introduction, pleasant 
activity in connection with the subject, competition, suggestion, 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
arousal of feelings of value, or purpose, use of the definite 
and concrete, and the like. These may help temporarily. 
That is good. The greater work is that of which we have just 
spoken, that of making the interests permanent; and this 
is to be done above all else by means of repetitions and 
associations. The introduction of the pupils to a subject or 
activity may be pleasant, interesting, and perhaps easy at the 
outset, but this is not enough if the pupil is to be developed to 
his highest power. He must go to effort which is not so pleasant. 
And the repetitions, the self activity, the many associations with 
hard work are the things which may be hoped to bring him through 
so that he will be a man of concentration and of sustained effort 
to long and arduous tasks. 
The individual should also see so far as possible some returns 
for his labors or be made to realize that there will be returns of 
sufficient value. There is a much better attitude in work where 
the pupil realizes the value of the work to himself. 
Other Emotional Tendencies.—This right tilt, so to speak, 
given to the individual, and kept up, so that the desire, crav- 
ing, whatever it becomes, be a permanent thing, is necessary 
for the many affective responses of life. That we have appre- 
ciation, sympathy, harmless enjoyment, the gentler emotions, 
all of those tendencies of which we can think, towards clean- 
liness, neatness, politeness, unselfishness, as well as those of a 
more courageous sort, self-control, diligence, endurance, and 
all of those finer feelings for the beautiful, for humor, awe, 
reverence, and the like, necessitates that the individual have 
an insight into them, have the feeling for them and continue 
to live in such a way that they become a part of his life and a 
necessary part of his life. That is, he should so live, feel, think, 
and do, that these responses are necessary to give him satisfaction; 
and the absence of them, or the opposite kind of things, give him 
dissatisfaction. 
Imitation.—Here, perhaps, more than anywhere else in the 
realm of education we have need for the best to imitate. Instinc- 
tive as it is for the child to imitate, it is one of the commonest 
things for him to imitate the likes and dislikes of those around 
him, or more accurately, to imitate their actions and thus to 
acquire certain likes and dislikes. The best actions, and objects, 
the acceptable models, should be the material for his imitation, 
and his feelings will grow through his imitation whether he is
-P-A-G-E-149
  ACQUISITION OF AFFECTIVE AND MORAL TRAITS 149 
conscious or not. To have a finer appreciation of the best things 
in music, art, literature, the child must live in the presence of 
them. What he comes to like will be very largely that to which 
he has become accustomed. 
Moral Education.—The consideration of these permanent 
tendencies in the life of feeling leads us naturally to the problem 
of moral education. Out of all the thinking, feeling, and doing 
of the child should grow the ideals of right living, which them- 
selves should be permanent possessions and should then find 
expression in the will of the moral individual. 
Will in Moral Training —“ . . . Will, taken in a psycho- 
logical and not in a moral sense, is simply the general name for 
the sum total of tendencies, inherited and acquired, that deter- 
mine our actions; and we distinguish different types of will, 
according as these tendencies are so deep-seated and persistent 
that he attains his end, or at any rate continues to strive towards 
it, however remote it may be and however numerous the counter- 
suggestions that oppose it; and the man of weak will is one whose | 
tendencies are so instable that he is at the mercy of every fresh 
suggestion that comes. James remarks that, when the will is 
healthy, action follows, neither too slowly nor too rapidly, as the 
resultant of all the forces engaged; whereas, when it is unhealthy, 
action is either explosive or obstructed ; the mercurial or daredevil, 
temperament shows an explosive will, ‘discharging so promptly 
into movements that inhibitions get no time to arise;’ and the 
limp characters, the failures, sentimentalists, drunkards, schem- 
ers, show the obstructed will, in which ‘impulsion is insufficient 
or inhibition is in excess.’”’ 
The important thing in this connection is that our decisions 
and actions in accordance with the proper ideals become habit- 
ual. The moral man is the one who habitually makes his 
decision in terms of his ideals of right, or who acts in accord- 
ance with those ideals without even having to think and make 
a decision. 
Moral Habits Largely Those of the Second Type.— Moral habits 
are largely those of the second type, that is, those whose action 
is in terms of some general form of action, or in accordance 
with some ideal. Obviously in moral action there must often 
be considerable reflection in order to decide just what is right, 
just how one should act to be most just, etc. All of our gen- 
eral tendencies to be punctual, kind, merciful, helpful, involve
-P-A-G-E-150
  150 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
or may involve some conscious direction. What the teacher 
desires is that the tendency to act in the appropriate way is 
present and ready to act promptly, surely, and effectively, no 
matter what the obstacles, and that the permanent tendency 
is so strong that all it needs is to be released and directed. This 
recalls what we have already said about habitude, or habitual 
attitude.1% 
Moral Education in Our Schools.—It has not been our pur- 
pose to go into the many and difficult problems of moral edu- 
cation, but rather to show how certain essential factors enter 
into the making of permanent affective and moral tendencies. 
Reference to a recent article as to the problem in connection 
with our public schools may perhaps appropriately conclude 
what we have to say on the subject in this connection. This 
article is by Professor Drake of Vassar College, who tells that 
moral development depends partly, to be sure, on physical 
heredity. Poor constitution, mental defects, pathological 
conditions, and the like, are unfavorable for high moral develop- 
ment. Eugenics may do much in helping to stop the repro- 
duction of defectives in whom moral and, perhaps, all other 
kinds of development are limited. But the problem depends 
mostly upon social heredity of education. ‘Morality,’ he 
writes, ‘is something acquired by each generation, and not 
something transmitted by parents to offspring; we can greatly 
facilitate its acquisition. Morality is functional, not organic; 
it results from the way we use our powers and direct our instincts, 
not from their inherent nature. But we are not trying on any 
large and systematic scale to provide competent training in the 
art of life for our youth. We employ experts to teach them Latin 
and mathematics; we see to it that they know how to build 
bridges properly if they are to be engineers, or fill teeth properly, 
if they are to be dentists. But we leave the most important 
training of all, the training that shall show them how to guide 
their desires and instincts, how to avoid the snares and pitfalls of 
life, how to be steadily and honorably happy, to the haphazard 
attention of parents, who are for the most part themselves ill- 
trained and ignorant of how to live. We need not despair of 
the efficacy of moral training, for we have hardly begun to try it. 
if . Our educational system is fairly good on its inform- 
ative side, and in the mental drill it provides. But in its moral 
training it is inexcusably deficient. What if our school super-
-P-A-G-E-151
  ACQUISITION OF AFFECTIVE AND MORAL TRAITS 151 
intendents and college presidents were to recognize that the 
prime function of education were to discuss concrete problems 
of conduct, and to quicken conscience, by the many methods 
known to skillful educators? It could then turn multitudes 
of boys and girls trained to a code, as knights were trained in 
former days to courage and chastity and the service of the 
weak. What if loyalty to school and college were to come to 
mean primarily loyalty to that code; so that for a Harvard man 
anywhere to be detected in lying would be shame to that college, 
or for a Yale man to use unfair methods in business would be to 
make his classmates blush and brand him as untrue to his alma 
mater? . . . In this moral education, rather than in eugenics, 
lies our real hope for the raising of the general standards of moral 
conduct.’’2?

  CHAPTER 13 
THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
Most Improvement is Specific—We have said that if a 
student wishes to improve in anything, the best results come 
by practice in that one thing and not in something else. If he 
wishes to improve in memory for prose he should memorize 
prose; if in anatomy he should memorize anatomy; if in reasoning 
in logic. and philosophy he should study logic and philosophy; 
if in reasoning in practical affairs he should study practical affairs. 
One can state the same thing negatively by saying that improve- 
ment in one subject does not give equal improvement in other 
subjects. This is in direct contradiction to the old view, that one 
could study certain disciplinary subjects and thus train the 
mind so that it would be equally able to do any kind of mental 
work. This is the doctrine of formal discipline, as it was called, 
and no one who has read the results of experiments on the matter 
can longer maintain its truth in this extreme form. 
Some Transfers May Take Place.—Neither can one who knows 
the facts deny that there may be some improvement in activities 
other than those used; some general improvement so to speak; 
or, as it is generally termed nowadays, transfers of training from 
one field to another. Experiment has shown that improvement 
in one field may mean improvement to some extent in other fields. 
And, to go deeper into the problem, experiment has shown some 
of the factors which when learned transfer to another subject 
and the causes of these transfers. There may be transfer to help, 
that is, to cause improvement in another subject, or to hinder, 
that is to actually interfere with other performances in other 
subjects or lines of work. In brief, there is no training in any- 
thing which will make one equally able to do any other kind of 
work; there may be some improvement from one subject to 
another; there may be interference from one subject to another; 
experiments show us further something of the nature of transfer 
and the causes or conditions of the transfer. 
152
-P-A-G-E-153
  THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 153 
We are interested, then, in considering the nature and amount 
of improvement which may cross from one field to another; 
and the way in which we can make sure of the transfers where 
they are possible. But first we must be sure to eliminate certain 
things which might seem to indicate general improvement or 
transfer of training but which must really be explained on other 
grounds. 
Factors That Complicate the Discussion—We must be sure 
that what we attribute to study of some subject is not simply 
the result of the growth and normal development of the stu- 
dent; that is to say, an individual may do better in all subjects, 
not because he has put special attention on mathematics, or 
Greek, but simply because he is a year older. In the next place 
we must remember that men are not necessarily successful 
because they have studied hard subjects. It is likely that they 
had it in them to be successful whatever they studied, and 
being good students, having good stuff in them, was partially the 
cause of their choosing the hard subjects, and not the study of the 
hard subjects the cause of their success. It is undoubtedly true, 
of course, that the proper study of hard subjects was a valuable 
part of their training. 
Finally, one should not confuse the spread of training with 
the transfer of training. The improvement of one hand after 
the other hand is used is not due to transfer; when one hand 
is trained the use of the other is modified, if for no other reason, 
because the brain centers connected with the hands are modified 
and are better able to direct either hand; also, both hands may 
be somewhat active when one is being trained; or, again, the 
training of one eye which results in improvement of the other 
eye, most likely involves the use of both eyes in the training. 
Such things must be distinguished from the transfer of training. 
The Extent of Transfer.—If now we consider the extent of 
improvement from one field to another, we have evidence from 
experiment to give us partial answer. Improvement has 
appeared, for example, in several ways. Judging the size of 
certain areas brought about improvement in judging the size 
of larger areas of the same shape and areas of different shape; 
improvement transferred was from 30 per cent. to 52 per cent. 
as great as the improvement in the judgments of the areas 
practised. Practice in estimating weights brought improve- 
ment in estimating heavier weights 39 per cent. as great as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  154 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
improvement with the weights used in practice. But the 
improvement in judging parts of speech that was 21 per cent. 
in reduction of time and 70 per cent. in reduction of omissions, 
gave a transfer to the judgments of other parts of speech in 
reduction of time of only 3 per cent. and an actual increase in 
omissions of more than 100 per cent. Here, then, we find training 
in one performance interfering with action in another perform- 
ance. Other studies show that an improvement in one activity 
may bring about from 20 per cent. to 80 per cent. as much 
improvement in other activities. 
But they show also considerable interference. Increase of 
speed frequently brings about decrease in accuracy. Practice 
in writing digits for letters has helped in writing symbols for 
digits, but has interfered with writing digits for symbols, and 
the longer the drill was spread out in time the greater was the 
interference. Practice in memorizing some kinds of material 
has frequently helped memorizing other kinds of material, 
but, for example, drill in memorizing prose has hindered sub- 
sequent memorizing of non-sense syllables. Experiment and 
experience also show other interferences, for example, learn- 
ing to cross out certain letters may bring about interferences 
in crossing out other letters; learning to finger one kind of musical 
instrument makes a temporary interference with learning to 
finger some other kinds of instruments. Some experiments 
also point to the probable fact that the more expert one is in a 
certain thing the greater interference may be found in changing 
to other operations which involve the habits that are developed 
to the point of expertness. 
In thinking of the transfers and the per cent. of transfer that 
has just been mentioned, we must remember that these results 
were obtained under conditions which favored the transfer. 
Other experiments can be cited which show no evidence of any 
transfer whatsoever. We must therefore not assume that as 
many transfers or as large a per cent. of transfer ordinarily 
takes place in the course of the education of the students in our 
schools and colleges. All the evidence we have indicates that 
in the latter situation, transfers are less frequent and smaller 
in amount. 
The Nature of Transfer.—We are also specially interested in 
knowing what it is that transfers; no small part of an educa- 
tion lies in acquiring those habits, or whatever they may be,
-P-A-G-E-155
  THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 155 
which will help not only in the subject in whose study they 
are learned but also in other situations of life. (See also Ch. 12.) 
It is obvious that one cannot study a subject very thoroughly 
without in some way changing his point of view or his attitude. 
One is a different individual in so far as one has had added 
experiences; the nervous system is modified; the outlook of 
the person cannot be just the same as before, when one has 
studied a subject where careful and critical thinking has been 
demanded. A person is likely to be less inclined to accept 
statements unthinkingly; he may grow into the habit of asking 
the question, Is that true? or, in what way can I apply this fact 
to my work? Or a student may go into the laboratory and 
tend to react quickly and impulsively and to produce careless 
work with many details overlooked; but the demands of the 
course, if it be well taught, make the student more careful; 
he may now get into the habit of doing much better work; of 
being dissatisfied with careless work; of desiring to do and 
being pleased only with the better quality of work. So the 
experiences of life, influence of others, lectures, interviews, 
things read, may dispose one to act differently; to be more 
accurate, to be more sympathetic, to be more honest, or more 
neat, or more punctual. In short, one may learn from one 
situation or study that which will change his attitude, his dis- 
position, so that he will respond differently thereafter in many 
situations of life. 
Again, it is found that one may learn methods of doing things 
and transfer their use to other situations; methods of study may 
apply to all kinds of study; methods of handling apparatus, of 
memorizing, of grouping facts or of outlining material may be of 
wide application. Indeed the improvement found in many 
experimental studies is found to be due very largely if not almost 
wholly to better methods. These methods may apply to many 
other lines of work than that in which they are learned. 
The knowledge of facts may also transfer from the subject 
in which they are learned; they may be recalled and used in 
situations widely different; they may form the bases of judg- 
ments; and they may of course change the attitude and thus 
the response of the learner. 
Factors in Transfer.— Without attempting to classify we may 
mention the following transfers which have been reported by 
students of the problem: Improved methods, improved habits
-P-A-G-E-156
  156 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
of attention and will; moral qualities such as diligence, per- 
severance, and intensity of application; method of orientation, 
that is to say, special training gives us ability to respond more 
favorably in a new situation; better discrimination in the same 
field, for example, of colors, or of judging length of lines; facile 
adaptation of attention and control of mental imagery; adjust- 
ment to apparatus and to general conditions; special methods, 
general methods; habits of analyzing each new situation, or of 
trying to induce variations instead of repeating an unsuccessful 
reaction time after time; confident and self-reliant attitude 
toward a new situation; habit of keeping up active attention 
during the course of practice, and of looking for improved 
methods and higher units, instead of settling down to a mediocre 
performance. 
We are told that: ‘‘Transfer is readiest in the realm of ideas: 
and the more definitely a method of work, either special or 
general, has been conceived and formulated, the wider is the 
field of its probably usefulness. It may be remarked in pass- 
ing that all these admittedly possible forms of so-called trans- 
ference when taken together, amount to a tolerably complete 
summary of the most essential factors in what is popularly 
included in the training, or culture of the mind.’’*> It is worthy 
of note also to recall the early conclusion of Woodworth and 
Thorndike: “The mind works in great detail, adapting itself, 
of necessity, to the particular material with which it has to deal; 
and, therefore, that training in one performance could only help 
another when the two had elementary factors in common.” ‘The 
study has only begun, and we must wait patiently to know more 
about what is transferable and from what subjects, and especially 
by what methods, the greatest number and the most important 
transfers can be had. 
Transfers, though Possible, May Not Take Place.—It must be 
remembered that while transfers are often possible, they may 
not take place. In fact, we cannot expect them to take place 
unless certain conditions of transfer are present. Two stu- 
dents may study the same thing, one getting a transfer or trans- 
fers to other situations, the other getting no transfer; or the same 
student may at one time study so as to get transfers, and at 
another time he may study so that he will fail to get any transfer. 
The Conditions of Transfer—We may now ask what condi- 
tions are necessary in order to secure transfers where they are
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 157 
possible. This question can be answered, at least partially, 
from the results of experimental studies. Certain conditions 
have been found to bring about transfer, whereas, the transfer 
failed to take place when these conditions were absent. Bagley 
found, for example, that a child might be taught to be neat in 
writing papers for one subject but that he would not thereby 
learn to be neat in other subjects; later investigations showed 
that when the child was roused to have the ideal of neatness, 
the habit transferred in many cases to papers in other subjects. 
The presence of the ideal of the habit to be transferred is, then, one 
of the conditions of transfer. Being definitely conscious of the 
thing to be transferred and making the attempt to transfer it, 
that is, trying to apply it to some other situation makes the 
transfer more likely.® 
Judd tells us that ‘‘Transfer depends on the power of gener- 
alization. The first and most striking fact which is to be drawn 
from school experience is that one and the same subject matter 
may be employed with one and the same student with wholly 
different effects, according to the mode of presentation. If the 
lesson is presented in one fashion it will produce a very large 
transfer; whereas if it is presented in an entirely different 
fashion it will be utterly barren of results for other phases of 
mental life . . . A teacher can teach birds and plants in sucha 
way as to arouse a minimum of ideas in the student’s mind . . . 
On the other hand, the same subject matter may be taken by a 
different teacher, and under other methods can be made vital 
for the student’s whole thinking. James cites the example of 
his own experience with a smoking student-lamp. He discovered 
by accident that the lamp would not smoke if he put something 
under the chimney so as to increase the air current, but he did 
not realize that what he had done was only one particular example 
of the general principle that combustion is favored by a large 
supply of oxygen. The general principle and its useful applica- 
tion belongs to a sphere of thinking and experience which the 
untrained layman has not yet mastered.’’5! 
In this connection it is fitting to recall the interesting foot- 
note which Karl Pearson thought it worth while to add to the 
discussion of scientific method in his Grammar of Science. 
“Personally,”’ he writes, ‘‘I have no recollection of at least 90 
per cent. of the facts that were taught me at school, but the 
notions of method which I derived from my instructor in Greek  
-P-A-G-E-158
  158 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
grammar (the contents of which I have long since forgotten) 
remain in my mind as the really valuable part of my school 
equipment for life.”’?77 
Transfers Actually Taking Place in Our Schools.—The writer 
has made an attempt to discover transfers and the causes of 
transfers that are actually taking place in education. The 
observers were to record things that had been learned in one 
study or situation which they found active, either to help or to 
hinder, in other studies and situations. Six observers worked 
systematically and reports were also had from several college 
classes. Many of the things mentioned were too indefinite to 
be of much value. But there was considerable concurrence in 
certain respects. And the value of these reports lies largely 
in the fact of corroboration by different observers who reported 
independently of one another. 
Those conditions recurring in the reports of both systematic 
observers and students in my classes include the following: 
Realization of advantage or usefulness or importance of the 
thing that transferred. Feeling of need or actual demand for 
application. Desire to use, or to apply, desire for results, 
interest, desire to improve. A few observers mentioned for 
many transfers, the continuance of a well formed habit or of 
the use of a method that had become thoroughly habitual. 
Some observers recognized that a combination of some of these 
conditions had been the cause of the transfers. In a number 
of cases these observers also mention the method of instruc- 
tion of their teacher as being the cause of the transfer. The 
teacher, in other words, had aroused in them the desire to apply 
what they learned, had shown them the advantage of so doing 
and had shown them how to make the application. 
We must undoubtedly conclude that there are various con- 
ditions of transfer; others that we have not yet discovered may 
be found; whether or not they can all be reduced to a single 
type is a question and it is, perhaps, too early to attempt to 
decide this matter. 
Maxims for Bringing about Transfers.—If we were to state 
maxims for getting transfers and for directing our education 
so that the greatest amount of desirable transfer could be had, 
the following might be stated: Choose those subjects in which 
there is the largest number of things common to many situa- 
tions in life. Choose the best teacher, and sometimes choose
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 159 
  the teacher instead of the subject. Form the habits and learn 
the methods that can be used helpfully in many situations. Be 
conscious of the “notion” of idea of method and form the habit 
of applying what is learned. Have the ideal of the thing to be 
transferred. Try to generalize. Realize the value or advan- 
tage of making transfers. Cultivate valuable attitudes and 
points of view. 
Mentioning these things as we have emphasizes the fact that 
transfers depend upon the student, and upon the ways of 
doing things, as well as upon the teacher. The teacher should 
also remember that he must help the student to do the things 
mentioned above. Standards should be set according to the 
point of progress of the student, ideals should be made con- 
scious in the student, and no teacher should accept inferior 
work. 
Transfers and the Choice of Subjects.—From the psycholog- 
ical point of view the student has at least two main problems 
in the choice of subjects so far as he has any choice. On the 
one hand, he should have a specific training for something; a 
training which shall make it possible for him to do something 
and to do it well. On the other hand he has the problem of 
general education, as it is called, of learning those things, and 
of becoming acquainted with those fields which will make him 
a possessor of the common heritage of his people, which will 
give him that common knowledge and insight into the activi- 
ties and institutions of the people with whom he will live. When 
he may choose, then, he should choose those subjects which 
give him the information and insight and acquaintance with 
things that are required of the educated person, making the 
choice such that. he will study subjects which have the largest 
number of elements in common with future living, and which 
will demand of him the formation of those habits which will be 
the most useful later; and wherein he will learn the best ideas 
of method, and the highest ideals, and be aroused to the desire 
to apply what he has learned. It is, therefore, as we have already 
said, not merely a choice of subject matter, but also a choice of 
teachers, since one teacher may teach so that many transfers 
result and another teacher fail altogether in this respect. 
A subject supposedly of high disciplinary value may be taught 
so as to be of less disciplinary value than any other well taught 
subject. That is to say, the demands that are put upon the
-P-A-G-E-160
  160 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
student, the way in which he studies, are perhaps, of more impor- 
tance than the subject itself. Certain subjects are or may be of 
more disciplinary value than others, because they offer better 
opportunities for, or demand better use of, the student’s intel- 
lectual activities. But again, the subjects that are not supposed 
to be of high disciplinary value may be studied so as to be of great 
disciplinary value. Remember that the most valuable thing is 
the right use of the mind, the formation of the right habits of 
study, the gaining of the right ideas of method and habits of 
method, attaining the highest ideals and the desire to apply. 
It should be added that the student should study subjects hard 
enough to call out his best efforts, subjects which appeal to him 
as worthy of his powers. 
The Value of Intensive Study.—The sufficiently intensive 
study of some one thing may broaden a student in a way of which 
he never dreamed. Tennyson suggested that if we knew enough 
about the flower in the crannied wall, we would know what God 
and man are. All knowledge may be likened to a ball and all 
parts of this knowledge may be likened to lines which lead from 
the surface to the center; these lines are interconnected. If we 
should go deep enough on any one of these lines we would 
approach this center; and if we should be thorough as we go 
along we should work out on many intersecting lines. We would 
thus travel far towards the center of knowledge and at the same 
time learn much of the related subjects. In other words, 
thorough intensive study may at the same time be broad.

  CHAPTER 14 
PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CONDITIONS 
Dependence of Mind on Body.—We have come to realize 
that without ideals, purpose, determination, one is not likely 
to accomplish what he could with them. Or, again, without 
improvement in methods of doing things we cannot do them 
most economically. But, also bodily conditions and the influ- 
ence of environment are so vital that we must see that they are 
the best possible. 
We do not have far to go to find evidences of the dependence 
of mind on body. A blow on the head may make one uncon- 
scious; failing health often makes it impossible for one to do 
good mental work; one may notice his memory failing in sick- 
ness and returning to normal activity with the return to health; 
drugs often interfere with mental processes or may render one 
unconscious; adenoids and defects of the various senses all have 
their various effects on intellectual work. 
The argument that great people have sometimes had marked 
physical defects, or that people have done great things even 
though they had serious bodily deficiencies does not in any 
wise prove that the defects made no difference and were unim- 
portant. The defects very likely impeded the endeavors of 
these and other people who may have had them. On the other 
hand the defects may have had the effect of provoking them to 
greater effort. 
The fact is that there appears to be a positive correlation 
between physical defects and failure of normal progress in 
our schools. It is reported that children in New York City 
schools who have had physical defects make 8.8 per cent. less 
progress than the normal children. 
Special Defects—Dr. W. 8S. Cornell,'® in his Health and 
Medical Inspection of School Children, writes that except for 
poor nutrition, defective hearing in moderate degree is the 
most powerful retarding influence encountered by school 
children. The results of defective hearing induce defective

scholarship in general (see Figs. 14 and 15) and defective speech 
in particular. Dullness, smaller head, and inferior strength of 
grip are said to be correlated with defective hearing. 
A simple operation may remove wax or some foreign body 
from the ear and permit a child to hear who had not been able 
to hear before. The writer learned of a case recently where a 
girl by such a simple operation was able to hear distinctly for 
the first time, in at least a good many years. She informed 
her mother, ‘‘I can hear what the teacher says now; I can hear 
the clock tick.”” The disposition of the child changed notice- 
ably also. She had been disagreeable and difficult to manage;

after the operation this changed and she was very distinctly 
more agreeable and tractable and was much more willing to 
do what her parents asked;—perhaps, she knew for the first 
time with some degree of clearness just what they wanted. 
For a comparison of results of an experiment comparing hearing 
and deaf children, see Figs. 14 and 15. 
Eye difficulties have interfered with study to an extremely 
large degree. It has been estimated that perhaps 60 per cent. 
of children who are studying need glasses. It is to be remem- 
bered that where one may not need glasses if he is not doing 
close work with the eyes, close work is just the thing that 
makes it necessary to give the eyes all possible aid. A study 
by F. J. Mann shows that hyperopia is five times more preva-
-P-A-G-E-164
    164 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
lent than myopia. One hundred and ninety-one cases were 
very carefully studied. Hyperopia is considered by Prof. 
Mann as a much more serious cause of eyestrain and retardation 
in schools than myopia.*® 
Nose and throat troubles and especially infected tonsils and 
adenoids interfere with school work. Children who were thought 
to be subnormal and who had such infected parts removed have 
been found to be of normal intelligence and fully able to keep 
up with normal children. 
Although it has probably not been conclusively shown that 
poor teeth cause poorer mental work, there is no doubt that 
poor teeth, if they are not remedied, bring about serious phys-

ical conditions in adult life. Besides the statement that bad 
teeth lower scholarship, there is no doubt about the effects of 
bad teeth on lowered health, impaired digestion, and the greater 
danger of contagious diseases. There is found to be considerable 
correlation between bad teeth and rheumatism, and there is also 
evidence that not a few nervous diseases or at least disorders, 
may be traced to defective teeth and cured by the necessary 
treatment of the teeth. 
Food.—Lack of sufficient food, poorly prepared food, con- 
stipation, and resulting auto-intoxication, poor digestion, and 
lack of assimilation of food, lower the level of both physical 
and mental work. Forty-three per cent. of the New York City 
school children were at one time said to be underfed. The
-P-A-G-E-165

penny lunches appear to have been followed by better school 
work. In Minneapolis recently there was found a family in 
which the children had always done uniformly excellent school 
work. Suddenly the work of all deteriorated and on investiga- 
tion it was found that because of business reverses and financial 
loss the family were unable to obtain sufficient food. Upon 
supplying sufficient, good, well cooked food again the children 
were found doing their customary excellent work. 
A Balanced Diet.—People commonly pay too little attention 
to getting a balanced diet. Fisher and Fisk give a table by 
means of which one can roughly determine a properly balanced 
diet. See Table 1.27

“The foods given in the uppermost compartment are those 
‘very high’ in protein. . . The compartment farthest to 
the right contains a list of those foods ‘very’ high in fat . 
The foods in the lower left compartment are rich in carbohydrates. 
Those in neighboring compartments are moderate and the 
others are poorest in carbohydrates.” 
“Thus practically the nearer the name of any food is to the 
upper left corner of this triangle table, the more protein that
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
food contains; the nearer it is to the right hand corner, the more 
fat . . . and the nearer to the remaining corner (lower left), the 
more carbohydrate (starch and sugar).”’ 
“An ideal proportion of the three food elements is to be had 
only in the middle compartment of the lowest row. But it is 
by no means necessary or advisable to confine one’s diet to the 
few foods which happen to fall in that compartment, provided 
foods chosen from other compartments balance each other. 
Thus, fruit and nuts balance each other, the one being at the 
left and the other at the right of the ideal compartment. In 
the same way, potatoes and cream balance each other, as do 
bread and butter. Instinctively these combinations have been 
chosen, especially bread and butter. This combination is, 
however, slightly too low in protein, and a better balance is 
obtained by adding a little from the compartment vertically 
above the ideal. In this way we obtain the familiar meat-, 
egg-, or cheese-sandwich, constituting of itself a fairly well- 
balanced meal.” 
“In short, in order to maintain a diet correct as to protein, 
it is only necessary to make our main choices from the lowest 
row and, in case the foods so chosen are near the bottom, to 
supplement these by a moderate use from the row above and 
a still more sparing use of those in the top compartment.’’?’ 
The importance of a correct diet cannot be overestimated 
and most of us could do better than we do in the matter. 
Other pages in the book just referred to are recommended to 
the reader. 
Air.—It was safe to say only a few years ago that people 
needed a certain amount of fresh air to breathe. Recent 
researches have suggested that perhaps all we need is to put old, 
much breathed air into motion. We at least are assured of 
the fact that air in motion can be breathed with perfect com- 
fort and no physiological ill effects for a much longer period 
than can air which is not in motion. The unpleasant effects 
of air which has been breathed for some time can often be removed 
in this way. 
Many systems of ventilation have been worked out and 
many studies of ventilation have been made. A good system 
of ventilation is invaluable. It has not been proved, that it is 
not wise to judiciously use window ventilation to supplement 
even the best systems of ventilation that have yet appeared.
-P-A-G-E-167
  PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CONDITIONS 167 
Prof. Lee,*8 of Columbia University, in a recent report of the 
effects of atmospheric conditions in relation to physiological 
action, notes the current emphasis upon physical rather than 
upon chemical features. He writes: “The harmfulness of living 
in confined air is found in certain physical rather than chemical 
features—the air is too warm, too moist, and too still; and if it 
has not these physical features it is not harmful.’’ It is perhaps 
too early to predict what the status of carbon dioxide will be in 
the future. We are not at present ready to have any per cent. 
at all of carbon dioxide in the air that we breathe and will prob- 
ably remain a little critical of the statement that ‘the harm- 
fulness of air is not due to its chemical components.” There is 
no doubt about the need of keeping the physical conditions 
much better than has been done. 
Temperature.—Prof. Lee refers to the common experience 
of all when he writes in this same article, “We all have sat in 
crowded assemblies; we all have experienced the hot, humid, 
still days of an American summer; we all know the effects of 
such air on our sensations—the general bodily discomfort, the 
sleepiness, the flushed face, the headache, the disinclination to 
think or to act, the general debility, the longing for relief.” 
Summing up the facts presented by Mr. Huntington, in his 
book, “Civilization and Climate,” Prof. Lee continues: ‘All 
these data combine to demonstrate that the greatest physical 
efficiency of the individual is found not during the summer or 
the winter, but at intermediate seasons.” That the same is 
true also of mental activity is shown by a study of the marks 
secured by the students at West Point and Annapolis in cer- 
tain classes, especially mathematics. Of the various climatic 
features that might be responsible for these seasonal differ- 
ences in achievement, temperature appears to be the most 
important. Both physical and mental activity seem to be greatest 
and most effective, not when extreme summer’s heat or extreme 
winter’s cold prevails, but when the body is subjected to an 
intermediate temperature. After a careful consideration of his 
many figures Huntington came to the conclusion that the opti- 
mum temperature of the outside air for the physical work of. 
human beings is about 60 degrees F. (15.5 degrees C.) and for 
mental work about 40 degrees F. (4.4 degrees C.) the greatest 
efficiency of the human body culminating at the intermediate 
point of 50 degrees F. (10 degrees C.).
-P-A-G-E-168
  168 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
The studies we have all go to show that the customary tem- 
perature, 70 degrees F. in which we are likely to keep our liv- 
ing rooms is too high. A temperature of 65 degrees to 68 degrees 
F. (about 18 degrees to 20 degrees C.) is probably best. It is 
likely also that the air is too quiet. And a third very important 
factor is the humidity. 
Humidity.—Professor Whipple has called our attention to 
the fact that the air in our dwellings sometimes exceeds in 
dryness that of the Desert of Sahara. The importance of humid- ~ 
ity is so great that it would not be at all surprising if we should 
some day measure the humidity of our indoor air as carefully 
as we now measure the temperature. The hygrometer may some 
day be as common as the thermometer. The New York com- 
mission has recommended 50 per cent. relative humidity as most 
desirable. We are certainly not likely to do our best work, 
either physical or mental, if the air is either too dry or too moist. 
Atmospheric Conditions and Mental Work.—Experiments as 
yet do not seem to clearly indicate the effects of atmospheric 
conditions on mental work. Further experiments on a fairly 
large scale are under way. Common experience and the obser- 
vations already quoted above, however, indicate deleterious 
effects of extreme conditions. The fact is that extreme con- 
ditions are distractions, or at least tend to detract attention. 
More effort is therefore required on the part of the student 
and this constitutes a serious difficulty in the school room and 
in the case of any student who lacks the necessary motives, 
interest, or pressure to overcome the disturbing influences. 
Uniformity of atmospheric conditions, that is, with little or 
no changes, is found to be dulling to both mind and body. 
Change is stimulating and if not too extreme or too often, is 
valuable. Clothing is important. Impeding the circulation 
of the blood by too tight clothing interferes also with the men- 
tal processes. To attempt to disregard these things, to over- 
come them by force of will, may be heroic, but is uneconomic 
and requires the paying of too big a price for diminishing 
returns. At the very outset the physical conditions should be 
as nearly right as possible. 
Regularity and Efficiency.—Regularity of eating, sleeping, 
plenty of good nourishing food and of sleep, keeping the body 
in the best condition always, will do more for the intellectual 
welfare of the student than he realizes. Suppose that the
-P-A-G-E-169
  
  PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CONDITIONS 169 
student keep himself in this fine physical condition, and then 
push himself to his best efforts; that responsibilities and demands 
be made upon him; that he studies regularly and for long hours; 
he will be astonished to find what it is possible for him to accom- 
plish. And, further, he will find that while he turns out more 
and better work, he can do it with perfect comfort. To use artifi- 
cial stimulants to work leaves one in an abnormal condition; to 
use the right incentives, to concentrate effort, to develop interests 
and discover motives, to perfect methods of study, to keep the 
body healthy for this purpose, reveals deeper levels of energy and 
develops a degree of efficiency of which the student may never 
have dreamed. 
Change of Work.—To change from one kind of study or 
work to another kind often brings better results. One is not 
rested by doing this, but he feels rested. It removes weari- 
ness, the feelings of effort and boredom, and lets up on the 
strains that have started. Different parts of the brain may 
be called predominantly into action. And only predominantly, 
let it be said, for the brain works so much as a unit, that it is not 
true to say that you use one part for one thing and another 
part for something else. Many parts of the brain are active - 
whenever any of it is active. Different muscles may be exercised. 
If the eyes are used very much for one subject, a change to 
something requiring less eye work is advantageous. 
Furthermore, the student should learn to do his hardest 
work, his best study, at the times when he is most rested, when 
he has the best supply of energy. It is certainly a mistake to 
think that one can do very good mental work when physically 
tired. It is much more economical to rest a while and then 
begin study. It is doubtful whether study should be done 
immediately after a meal; the blood should not be called imme- 
diately from the stomach to the brain by hard intellectual work. 
Such time might well be used for rest, recreation, or perhaps, 
for light, pleasant reading or conversation. 
Fatigue.—Fatigue is defined as the reduction in capacity 
for and pleasure in work. Mental fatigue is fatigue for men- 
tal work; bodily fatigue is fatigue for bodily work. Fatigue 
we have already distinguished from weariness or the feeling 
of fatigue. This feeling, we said, was no safe indication of the 
actual fatigue, that is for the actual lack of capacity for further 
work. Actual fatigue can be removed only by rest. Recre.  
-P-A-G-E-170
170 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
  ation, change of work or of subject matter, may remove the 
weariness but do not change the fatigue. 
It should also be remembered that one cannot fatigue him- 
self for one kind of work, either mental or physical, and expect 
to be without the same fatigue for the other. He will be without 
the feeling of fatigue, perhaps, if the change of work brings 
renewed interest, relieves particular strains and unpleasantnesses, 
and brings pleasure through the change itself. Actual fatigue 
is not removed in this way. 
The value of shorter periods of study and of work has appeared 
from various quarters. We have already referred to the value 
of comparatively short study periods. The fact that workmen 
can turn out more and better work in reasonably shorter than 
longer periods has found its expression in the shortened hours, for 
example, in the eight instead of the ten hour day. Just as much 
and perhaps more can be done in the shorter time and with no 
more or at least relatively no more, and perhaps even less fatigue 
considering the time expended. 
Fatigue and School Hours.—The best progress in school 
requires careful elimination of fatigue whenever it appears, and 
careful administration of school affairs so that the minimum 
of fatigue results from the day’s work. Taking the judgment 
of Offner,”? which he made after an extensive study of the 
problem, we find the following statements. Sixty minutes is 
entirely too long for a class period and has no psychological 
reason for its justification. This applies to high school students. 
For older students a longer time is permissable, and eighty minutes 
is thought to be the longest which should be used for older 
students and then only for reviews. Forty-five minutes are 
recommended for the normal high school student. For lower 
grades thirty minutes are long enough. In connection with this 
matter we may well consider the apparent success of many princi- 
pals of high schools who have used thirty minutes periods for 
their students and alternate the recitation with the study period. 
This, you remember, agrees with the results of experiment on 
the value of comparatively short study periods, 7. e., twenty to 
thirty minutes. 
Offner says that five periods a day are enough and that some 
authorities have decided that a return to four periods is wisest. 
The maximum for the week according to this writer should be 
twenty-four. As to pauses in the work; the pauses should be 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
    
PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CONDITIONS 171 
shorter early in the day and longer later in the day. It is very 
questionable as to the value of very strenuous exercise for those 
who are studying. A moderate degree of exercise is beneficial; 
much more than that may bring one too near to the point of 
fatigue and interfere more with mental work than it helps. 
The rather extreme suggestion of two hours rest over the 
noon hour before one begins the afternoon’s study will hardly 
meet with general approval. Yet this suggestion is found in 
the above mentioned author. The American would consider 
two hours rest in the middle of the day too much waste. The 
suggestion that informational instruction and class recitations 
be given up in the afternoon in order to keep students from 
studying during the noon hour is perhaps sufficiently well approxi- 
mated in the plan which throws laboratory and shop work in 
the afternoon. Surely a rest after the noon meal, or at least, 
restraint, if happily it be restraint, is beneficial. 
Sleep.—Professor Whipple, 12° recommends the following hours 
of sleep for people of the ages given. The hours are averages 
from figures given by the six best authorities. See Table 2. 
For an admirable study of the sleep of school children one should 
read the study of Terman and Hocking.

Hours: 12.2 11.5 11.2 11 10.5 10.2 9.8 9.6 9.25 9.0 8.75 8.5 
More sleep is necessary for more strenuous work or play, 
for younger people, and in winter than in summer. If 
sleep does not fully restore the organism to complete capacity, 
that sleep was insufficient or the work of the day before too 
strenuous. 
Short Naps.—Experiments and experience seem to show that 
short naps may be very useful in economizing time and energy. 
The rest and recuperation is greatest soon after going to sleep 
if one may reason from the soundness of sleep, and is less and less 
so in succeeding hours. See Fig. 16. It has been said that a 
person can get the greatest amount of good from his hours of 
sleep if he cuts short the long night rest and takes a short 
nap in the middle of the day. He thus takes advantage of the 
greater rest to be gained from the earlier portions of two sleep 
periods,

“Tt appears that loss of sleep can be made up by fewer extra 
hours than the number lost though the explanation of this is 
not fully apparent.”

Social activities do more than hard work to bring on fatigue 
and in the cases of many of our students nervous breakdowns. 
Social intercourse in moderation is not only beneficial but neces- 
sary for the growth and development of normal life. But 
late hours and insufficient sleep with midnight suppers thrown 
in inevitably show in the lack of efficiency the next day, the 
extra energy required for the same work, the greater number

This may be fashionable, but the student will have to become 
more than ordinarily expert in statistics to prove that it is 
economical. 
Study in evening school after a hard day’s work cannot be 
expected to give the returns that study without any degree of 
fatigue would give. Economy for the students in evening 
classes would be found in using part of their available time in 
resting and then studying. The study time even though shorter
-P-A-G-E-173
  PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CONDITIONS 173 
would give better results. One must be careful not to sleep 
too long before the evening study, if he sleeps at all, for he 
must avoid the getting too drowsy to do any effective study later. 
Raising the question whether or not it is permissible that 
pupils be fatigued, Offner answers, Yes. Fatigue is not dan- 
gerous if there is full recuperation every morning after the night’s 
rest. A man needs training to meet the emergencies that demand 
work to the point of fatigue. Better development comes through 
reasonably hard work. ‘An easy school is a social crime.” 
Mental Factors.—Normal progress in learning is also con- 
ditioned by factors which present themselves not in their physical 
aspect but in abnormal functioning; the child of good intelligence 
or perhaps even of exceptionally high mental ability may fail to do 
passing work. There may be nothing that tests seem to reveal 
except that something is wrong, which is observed in every day 
routine more than indicated by any test. The abnormal activity 
of some of those factors brought to our attention more especially 
by the method of psycho-analysis may very seriously condition 
the mental life of the individual. A child finds himself in an 
intolerable situation; he seeks escape from the situation, and if 
normal avenues fail, defense mechanisms arise, abnormal activities 
are exercised, something violent and tragic may be the outcome. 
Less extreme are the fears that upset children and from which 
they often discover some imaginary kind of protection. Failure 
and disappointment are often followed by fancied victory, the 
victory of fantasy and the flight from reality. Abnormal 
repressions and shame and hiding of that which ought to be 
frankly discussed pervert the thinking and upset the individual. 
The feeling of inferiority may lead one to cease to try to do things 
and a permanent complex may be developed. The abnormal 
functioning appears in various forms: in compromise with reality, 
in ignoring it or in distorting it. 
The extreme of this abnormal functioning is found in the insane. 
More moderate forms are found in children and adults, in the 
school and the home, and these individuals may become the 
victims of circumstances which will either win them back to 
normality or push them to that degree of abnormality that will 
be diagnosed as insanity. For fuller discussion of these subjects 
the reader is referred to the books of Burnham, Mateer and 
Morgan to all of which references are given at the end of the 
chapter.

    PART 3: STIMULATION 
CHAPTER 15 
CASE STUDIES AND PRINCIPLES OF STIMULATION: 
INTEREST AND PRIMARY ATTENTION 
' The Release of Energy.—One of the most conspicuous charac- 
teristics of the living organism is that it responds to stimuli 
in a vastly different way than do inanimate objects. A billiard 
ball responds, if the term be permitted in this case, in direct 
proportion to the amount of stimulus. The response of a liv- 
ing organism, and especially of the human organism, is likely 
to be out of all proportion to the strength of the stimulus. The 
response is more nearly similar to the action of gunpowder, 
or of a coiled spring when the energy is suddenly released. 
The analogy is inadequate. The response of the organism 
may be varied and the extent of the reaction impossible to 
calculate beforehand. But the analogy holds in one respect. 
The response of the organism is determined both by the stim- 
ulus and by the inherent tendencies to respond. Instinctive 
and acquired dispositions, which are many and varied, are 
necessary to account for the many and extensive responses of 
the organism. Also, and especially in the human being, the 
problem is complicated by the inhibitions which may limit or 
entirely hinder any response at all. 
The Teacher’s Work is to Arouse and to Direct.—If these 
inherent tendencies in the student were absent the process of 
education would never even get started. No difficult case in 
my own teaching experience ever aroused so deep an interest 
in me as one in which these feelings and tendencies seemed 
to be as nearly missing as they could be in'a human being. The 
young man in question had no apparent interest in anything. 
He made no progress in his studying. In fact, so far as I knew, 
he did little more than to take an attitude of study at rare inter- 
vals. I asked him if he did not want to keep up with his class; 
he said that he did not care. I inquired if he did not care what 
175
-P-A-G-E-176
  176 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
his teachers thought about his work; he said that it did not 
matter. Did he not care what the fellows thought; it made no 
difference what they thought. Was he not interested in any 
study or work; no, not at all. My own interest in him and in 
his work seemed to arouse none in him. Nothing mattered. 
There seemed to be nothing to appeal to. 
One day I invited him to spend the afternoon with me. I 
took him to lunch and then through a part of the University 
which he had not seen, and we finished the day by seeing part 
of a base-ball game. From that time he was interested and 
eager to do anything I asked. The authorities had just ordered 
him to a school for delinquents because he had trouble with 
all his teachers; but he obtained permission to come and work 
for me part of each week. The secret was that he had been 
punished, pounded, maltreated at home and at school until he 
was callous to all appeals that had formerly been made. Now 
he did care and he worked well, as well, indeed as any of my 
pupils. The point is: he began to care; the right stimulus had 
finally aroused him. 
The Means of Appeal: Native and Acquired Dispositions.— 
The materials with which the teacher has to work so far as the 
student is concerned are his native and acquired dispositions. 
The individual has at the beginning of life, and acquires later 
many intellectual, emotional, and bodily tendencies to activity. 
The task of the teacher is to arouse the ones desired and to 
direct the activity into desirable channels. This is the rule 
but occasionally it is right to repress some activities. Such 
repression can generally best be done by the arousal and direc- 
tion of another activity. 
No complete list of the tendencies which a teacher has to 
work with has been made. And for the most part thorough 
analysis and understanding of the native tendencies are still 
to come. The tendencies themselves form the means to the 
transformation of the individual into that which he should be. 
The ends to be attained are the more or less permanent dis- 
positions. Without attempt at classification or of complete- 
ness, we give the following list of tendencies with which the 
teacher should be familiar. For such knowledge the teacher 
should have a course in Child Study. It may not be too much 
impressed upon the teacher that he is dealing with activity and 
life, not with inactivity and death.

What the tendencies are: 
Reflexes Manipulation 
Tendencies to more complex move- Love of approval 
ments Desire to be with others 
Fear To be comfortable or annoyed 
Imitation Sex instinct 
Fighting Parental instinct 
Rivalry Repulsion 
Acquiring and collecting Credulity 
Protecting instinct Suggestibility 
Hunting Tendency to try things out 
Scorn Tendency to let things be 
Self assertion Empathy 
Submission Tendency to run from 
Bashfulness Wonder 
Bullying Elation 
Tendency to follow Pity 
Tendency to lead Surprise 
Curiosity Fascination 
Love Joy 
Anger Sorrow 
Tendency to enjoy Respect 
Avoidance of pain Reverence 
Play 
Let it be remembered that this is no attempt to indicate the 
original nature of man, but to suggest the tendencies with 
which the teacher has to deal. Some of those named above 
are not native and simple but acquired and complex, e. g., the 
tendency to imitate. The list does not give elements which are 
irreducible to simpler tendencies. Play, for example, is com- 
plex. The teacher in actual work is not concerned with the 
final analysis of these things, but must work with simpler and 
more complex dispositions as opportunity permits and need 
demands. 
Results of an Attempt to Classify in Order of Importance.—It 
is of great value for the teacher to realize so far as possible the 
relative value of appeals to different tendencies. It is clear that 
this is so when one realizes that the activities aroused tend to 
become permanent, conforming as they must to the laws of habit. 
It is true that the teacher should know all the kinds of appeal 
that are available and follow the general principle of making 
the highest type of appeal possible in any given case. An attempt 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  178 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
at classification has been made by some of my students who have 
had experience in teaching. The following list shows the order 
from most to least important as agreed upon by the class after 
studying their separate reports and discussing them in class. 
Another group might find little agreement with this order, 
but would find it of value to consider the order given and to 
compare it with some other order that they judge better, and to 
think out the reasons for their preferences. 
1. Desire to learn and tendency to give attention. 
2. Curiosity and the tendencies to be interested and to use 
effort. 
3. Play. 
4. Imitation. Tendencies to unconscious and consciously 
directed imitation, and in connection with ideals. 
5. Emulation; also, in connection with fear of scorn and of 
criticism. 
6. Secondary race preserving tendencies: hoarding, exploring, 
ownership, manipulating, collecting, and the like. 
‘7. Altruistic: communication and codperation; gaining atten- 
tion of others for their good; kindness, and the like. To be 
master of or submissive to. 
8. Tendencies to physical adjustment: to give attention, 
to inhibit distractions, to make motor coérdinations. 
9. Primary race preserving tendencies: sex, gregariousness, 
reverence, jealousy, anger, bodily fear, sorrow, and the like. 
The Selfish Instincts.—Professor E. J. Swift, in his ‘‘ Youth 
and the Race,’’4 shows the way in which students have been 
aroused to devote themselves to earnest effort. Emulation, com- 
petition, ownership, and other native tendencies were aroused in 
such a way that enthusiastic study took the place of lack of 
interest and lawlessness. One point which he brings out is 
worthy of special consideration. It is that of the realization of 
an activity being ‘“‘mine” and for ‘‘my” good. Many examples 
are given to show how a pupil will take a new and deep interest 
in an activity which he comes to think of as not the teacher’s 
work but of being “my work.” Latin instead of being an 
uninteresting subject came to be a language in which to debate. 
Other subjects in which teachers worked in vain to keep up an 
interest came to be subjects in which the students vied with 
each other to be the best informed. It was their activity and 
not the teacher’s. Even truants were aroused to solve the  
-P-A-G-E-179
  
  INTEREST AND PRIMARY ATTENTION 179 
truancy problems in several schools and succeeded where the 
principals had failed. 
Case Studies of Successful Appeals.—The writer has collected 
cases of successful appeal by teachers and social workers. 
Many of these he has found in his visits to the school room. 
Some of them he has learned of in conversation with the teachers. 
For some of them he is indebted to the reports of former students 
in educational psychology, who report their own experiences, 
or who have brought to his attention successful cases of other 
workers. These cases illustrate concretely and vividly the 
application of psychological laws, and, it is hoped, may offer 
valuable suggestions to teachers who have not solved this particu- 
lar kind of problem. x 
A Tactful Request.—The following incident occurred in a 
country school. The scholars were of many different ages 
and sizes. The teacher was a young lady. One of the largest 
boys had been causing a good deal of trouble; finally he threw a 
large ball of paper across the room. The teacher who was 
accustomed to keep order told him to pick it up. This he refused 
to do. The teacher asked him several times, but he absolutely 
refused. The teacher asked him finally in the following way: 
‘All I can do is to ask you to pick it up. You are much larger 
and stronger than I am, so you see I cannot make you do it.” 
At this the boy changed his attitude, picked up the paper, and 
came to treat the teacher more courteously. 
The Group Spirit: the Pupil’s Own Problem.—The people 
living near a certain school play ground called an indignation 
meeting following the breaking of a window during a ball game. 
The play ground had been disorderly and the neighbors had had 
considerable trouble at various times. Contrary to the plan 
of these: people, the boys were permitted to attend the meeting. 
Before the supervisor of play grounds they were permitted to 
present their case. They admitted their wrong doings, and 
presented a plea for the use of the ground as before. They 
were finally granted the use of the ground to see what they could 
do to make it what it should be. 
After the parents had departed the boys stayed and took up 
the matter of discipline. They condemned smoking and swearing 
on the play ground and planned several reforms. It now being 
their problem they went to work to see that the ground was used 
so as to be unobjectionable and some of their own number were
-P-A-G-E-180
  180 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
appointed to see that the plans were carried out. A great deal 
of improvement in the discipline was observed. 
The Feeling of Usefulness.—In a sixth grade of a certain 
Minneapolis school, one boy was very obstinate and a great 
disturber of the school. The teacher had repeatedly kept him 
after school and tried different methods to get him to do better. 
All efforts had failed and they were very much at odds with 
each other. One noon she asked him to stay a few minutes. 
When she went to his desk she found him drawing a coffee 
pot and other similar objects. She asked him why he drew 
such things and he told her that his mother worked, so that 
when he reached home he had to prepare lunch for the other 
children and they were uppermost in his mind. She talked 
with him a few minutes and told him that she thought he could 
be of a good deal of help to her, that she would depend upon 
him to assist her with the diagrams, and drawings which she 
had to make. Beginning with that afternoon his conduct 
changed and he never afterwards gave any trouble. He showed 
interest in the work of the school and seemed to feel that he was 
of real use to the teacher and to the whole school. 
Being a Knight.—A boy in a local kindergarten came from a 
wealthy home and had no idea of obedience. He seemed to 
want to do whatever he thought he should not do. If the 
teacher told another child not to do a certain thing he at once 
did it. The teacher conceived the idea of having the boy take 
the role of a knight. What a knight should be was explained 
to him. A knight would be courteous, ete. Of course, a knight 
would not do certain things, for example, he would not knock 
down smaller boys, or pull girls’ hair. The idea appealed to 
the boy and he decided to be a knight. In this way he grew 
to one of the best behaved boys in the kindergarten. 
School Money, Bankbooks, and Ownership.—‘‘ At a small 
school in California which I attended some years ago,” writes 
a former student, ‘‘a number of devices were used to direct the 
energy and interests of the students into useful paths. In the 
first place, all of the boys and girls in the school were rewarded 
for their efforts by toy money. They were paid for washing the 
blackboards, for doing copy work for the teacher, for receiving 
the best marks in spelling or arithmetic for one week, and the like. 
There were also fines for misconduct. Each one in the school 
had his private account book. Monthly these books were handed   
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  INTEREST AND PRIMARY ATTENTION 181 
in for inspection. Incidentally, many of us learned some useful 
hints about keeping accounts. The system aroused the instincts 
of play, rivalry and ambition. Each child felt the pride of owner- 
ship in money he himself had earned by hard work. The children 
did not become miserly, but were generous with their money. 
In the same school, there was a monthly paper published by the 
students. Also, each one had his little garden plot in the school 
yard. In all these things, the children felt the pride of ownership 
and its responsibility. By appealing to the selfish instincts, the 
teacher gave the stimulus to rapid progress.” 
Appeal to Pride in One’s Own Possessions.—The following 
case represents the experience of one of my students. She writes: 
“When I was a child I took no interest inside the house and did 
not seem to be at all domestically inclined. My father had a 
play house built and all the children of the neighborhood enjoyed 
it. I took great pride in keeping my play house clean and 
straight, and it was almost impossible to keep me away from the 
place. I must have taken more interest in the play house 
because I felt that I owned it. This shows a pride in one’s own 
possessions not felt in another’s.” 
Winning Pupils through Tact, Play and a Friendly Attitude. 
The following quotation from the statement given me by a 
young and inexperienced teacher shows the possibilities that lie 
in the right treatment of a difficult case. 
“T had signed my contract to teach a rural school in the eastern 
part of county, Minn. The district had offered what 
was considered an unusually high salary and that fact alone 
was sufficient to prove that ‘there was something wrong some- 
where’. Hardly had I reached my boarding house before I 
was told of the awful ordeal ahead of me. No teacher in the 
last four years had been able to finish the term of her contract 
because of Willie. I learned that Willie was a boy of eleven, 
whom no one had been able to discipline. Even his parents 
could not do anything with him. Many tales were told of his 
obstinacy and absolute disregard of authority . . . Here was I, 
confronted by the problem, and only an inexperienced girl of 
seventeen. What was my surprise, on unlocking the school 
house door the next morning, to be confronted within by a 
sickly looking, stunted figure of a boy with a face which, despite 
the evident satisfaction of having ‘put one over on the new 
teacher’, was wizened and somewhat pitiful if one stopped’   
 
-P-A-G-E-182
182 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
  to analyze it. He had evidently crawled in through the window 
and seemed to be quite taken aback when I did not immediately 
reprimand him for having done so . 
“When I began to try to carry on a conversation with him 
he started to bounce a baseball against the blackboard. It 
was not yet 7:15 and after not noticing (apparently) what he 
was doing for some time and having arranged for the opening 
of school, I suggested to Willie, for it was none other than he, 
that we go out on the hill and play catch. I never have seen 
a more surprised boy. He seemed unable to understand me 
and did not take me seriously until I led the way. I had had 
considerable experience in playing catch, so was not at all doubt- 
ful about my ability, which so surprised Willie that he almost 
forgot, by the time the other pupils arrived, that he was playing 
with the new teacher whom he had come early to tease into 
reprimanding him . . . Several children arrived early, so I 
suggested that we play baseball, which suggestion was readily 
adopted. 
“By school time my ability to play and my attitude of ‘being 
one of them in their play’ had won the admiration, not only 
of Willie, whom I feared to meet, but of all the pupils, so that 
when we came into the school room every one went to the assigned 
seat and to work without the least disturbance. Not once during 
my stay of nine months did I have trouble with Willie and he 
begged his father, who was on the school board, to get me to 
come back. To this day, Willie is a loyal friend and his cards 
of greeting come regularly. His parents tell me that he learned 
more in those nine months than in all his previous school 
Work: 3°. 
“My measure of success was due to what at that time was an 
accident, but a lucky one for me, for it was one which resulted 
from my directing their innate tendency to play, and through 
that channel, I was able to direct not only Willie, but all the 
pupils into an attitude of mind which fostered study when it 
was time to study ... ” 
Army Organization and Reward of a Holiday.—A fifth grade 
teacher had experienced a great deal of trouble on account of 
noise and confusion in the school room and was getting dis- 
couraged over the general problem of discipline. To solve 
the problem she appointed those who were making the most 
trouble as captains,—one for each row, It was the duty of
-P-A-G-E-183
  INTEREST AND PRIMARY ATTENTION 183 
each captain to collect all papers and to maintain order in his 
particular row. Each child was under the jurisdiction of the 
captain of his row. And every soldier was to codperate with 
his captain in an endeavor to make his army, 7. e., the pupils 
in his row, maintain better order than was maintained in any 
other army. 
As a reward for the best disciplined army the teacher gave 
a half-holiday. Since the troublesome scholars are usually 
the most desirous of a holiday, this plan worked well and the 
teacher found a very effective method of keeping order with little 
effort on her part. 
The Arousal and Development of Interest.—One feeling, 
namely interest, deserves special mention. It goes with a dis- 
position particularly valuable for study. The means of arous- 
ing interest are various. Through some of the following means 
it is generally possible to arouse it if it be lacking and to increase 
it where there is very little. 
Interest and the Force of Suggestion.—There are many kinds 
of suggestion. People, actions, things, places, all are sugges- 
tions to something good or bad. In the first place, a desirable 
environment for study incites one to the work. Where the 
work is going on; where others are interested and enthusiastic; 
where the subject is being discussed; where the books or material 
are present and ready for use; and where distracting things are 
not too many or too insistent, the student finds that interest is 
likely to come, or if already present, to develop. When one has 
magazines coming to his door, and books on his table, they are 
suggestions to read. One is more likely to find himself reading 
them regularly than if the suggestion were lacking and he had to 
go to the library for them. People who suggest study are to be 
chosen and those who suggest laziness are to be avoided. Biog- 
raphy is very stimulating and one can hardly find any reading 
that offers more stimulating suggestion to effort than biography 
affords. 
The Law of Affective Expansion.—The gaining of some pleas- 
ant knowledge about a subject is often a means of arousing 
interest in the whole subject. No better way of starting botany 
can be found than by going with an interesting botanist 
through the woods and listening to him tell about this plant 
and that flower. One of my students reports to me that in 
high school he cared little or not at all about literature until  
-P-A-G-E-184
  
  184 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
one day a teacher read to the class one of Poe’s stories. After 
that he was not satisfied until he had read more of Poe. From 
Poe he went to Cooper and then to other writers. A visit to 
a municipal water works, has in my knowledge, led many students 
to an interest in the problems found there but has expanded to 
other problems of civics. One of my students reports the follow- 
ing expansion of interest in the field of history. ‘Interest in 
chivalry was aroused and this turned to interest in feudalism and 
from that led on to the crusades, and later to the rise of Italian 
cities, all of which transferred to the whole field of medieval 
history.” 
Association and the Development of Interest.—Another 
method of getting interest is to associate something pleasant 
with the activity. Rewards often act in this way. The pleas- 
antness of the reward is associated with the study itself. The 
pleasantness of a trip with the geology that is learned. The 
delightful textbook may associate pleasantness with the sub- 
ject itself. The sarcasm of a teacher too often couples the 
unpleasantness with the subject which is being taught. The 
interest which may be aroused by a moving picture is an illus- 
tration of this use of association. 
Interest and Attitude.—Another way to arouse interest is to 
take an attitude in connection with the matter. Take up a 
point in relation to your subject and defend it; or take a theory 
or what not and show its weakness or its value. It has been 
found that taking some such attitude may in the long run make 
the whole subject interesting. 
Realization of Use or Value.—Things are commonly interesting 
when we find a use to which we can put them. Courses are 
much more likely to be chosen if students find that they can make 
application of the material taught. One may develop an interest 
in a subject by discovering some way in which the knowledge 
may throw light on some of his problems; it may throw light on 
facts in some other field. It may be by coming to a realization 
of the significance of the subject in one’s future career. 
One may also find a deep and abiding interest in a subject 
if one can see its relation to some larger work, the way it may. 
help in achieving some larger purpose in life. Domestic science 
is often interesting because it is thought to be valuable in pre- 
paring the student for home making. So may other subjects be 
interesting if one only realize that studying them puts him into

possession of the intellectual heritage of his people and makes him 
acquainted with the things that are common knowledge of 
educated people. Certain it is that domestic science, and 
manual training, and like subjects have given many students a 
new interest in all the school subjects and have helped solve 
problems of interest and truancy alike. 
The Feeling of Need.—It is a commonplace of psychology 
that people give attention to those things that satisfy desires 
or needs. This fact is taken advantage of in the school in dif- 
ferent ways. The writer discovered this principle being used 
systematically by some of the teachers in The Dunwoody Insti- 
tute in Minneapolis. The boys were taken, for example, to 
the shop. Here certain work was planned. But to do this 
work it would be necessary to solve some mathematical problem. 
The boys were eager to begin the work on this particular piece 
but were told that they would have to be able to work out the 
mathematical problem for themselves. This they could learn 
to do in the class in mathematics upstairs and they found the 
mathematics teacher ready to lay aside other pressing matters 
and satisfy their desire to know how to do this problem. The 
members of this class showed unmistakable interest and good 
attention and all the mathematics teacher had to do was to 
explain the matter. Here, also, one finds a pretty example of 
correlation. 
On inquiry the teacher said that a very large number of the 
problems in mathematics could be made to come up in the 
. shop and thus be answered in the class room. Where they 
could not, the problem was presented in the class room in such 
a way that the pupils recognized that they would need this work 
in the shop or elsewhere before long. 
Interest through Special Topics.—In some of the schools 
which the writer has visited, he has found teachers assigning 
special topics to pupils. A problem would arise in the course 
of a recitation and, the pupils being unable to solve it, the 
teacher would ask one of the pupils if he would look up the 
matter and report it at the next recitation. Or a lesson would 
be assigned and the teacher would single out several topics of 
special significance and ask as many pupils to be prepared to 
talk on them next time, each pupil being given one of the topics. 
This plan seems to give very good results. The children have 
been interested not only in their own reports but in the reports    
-P-A-G-E-186
    _ 186 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
of other students and this interest has been accompanied by 
increased interest in the regular assignments. 
Interest and the Assignment of Lessons.—Making the assign- 
ment of the next lesson is a very important part of the teacher’s 
work. It is to be hoped that the old method of telling the pupils 
to “take the next chapter,” or “take the next eight pages”’ will 
soon disappear from practice as it has from theory. There is 
nothing interesting about such an assignment. It does notarouse 
to a study attitude. It has, perhaps, no advantage at all except 
that it saves the teacher the time of preparing the assignment. 
And the assignment should be prepared just as surely as the 
teaching itself should be prepared. The giving of the assignment 
is, in fact, a part of the teaching. 
Let us suppose that the ‘‘next chapter” is on capillary attrac- 
tion. What kind of a real assignment can be made? The 
writer suggests something like the following: It has been said 
that when one end of a small hollow glass tube open at both 
ends is put into water, the water will rise in the tube. If you 
lower one end of such a tube into the water, the water will rise 
inside the tube higher than the level of the water outside the 
tube? Will it always do this? I want you to find out whether 
or not this is true, and if it is sometimes true, when it is true? 
You can find help in solving this on pages so and so in your 
text book. 
Such an assignment has at least some advantages. It is 
more interesting than the assignment first mentioned. It may 
arouse the pupil to try for himself to find out the truth of the 
matter. It suggests experiment and the teacher may add 
further suggestion for experimentation when he gives the assign- 
ment. It is definite and not so likely to be forgotten as the 
other assignment. 
Utilizing Manual Activities—A boy in a local school was 
reported to be the worst that the truant officer had to deal with. 
Finally the boy was sent to a detention home for boys. It 
seemed as though no one could succeed in any way with the case. 
He stayed at the detention home for a few days and then ran 
away. He was later found and sent back to the home. Finally 
a man interested himself in the matter. Through his influence, 
the boy was admitted to one of the city schools again and allowed 
to take manual training. This was a special concession as he was 
below the age at which boys were permitted to take this subject.
-P-A-G-E-187
  INTEREST AND PRIMARY ATTENTION 187 
He became greatly interested, found an outlet for his desire to 
do things, and in a short time became one of the most efficient 
and trusted boys in the school. 
Use of the Dramatic Tendency.—The failure of one teacher 
to interest her pupils in geography was remedied in the fol- 
lowing way. She had a 6th grade class and her pupils showed 
almost no interest in the subject. They seemed to do as little 
work in connection with the subject as possible and could tell 
hardly anything about the work from day to day. Miss—— 
told her class one day that they might act out things where 
they found it possible. The children devised, with the help 
of the teacher, ways and means of acting out some of the activ- 
ities of different peoples. They even got costumes for some 
occasions and brought in some objects to illustrate the lives 
and occupations of those whom they were studying. Interest 
was kindled. The children studied, either to put on something 
of their own or to see if those who did put it on did it right. 
This method gave opportunity for originality and ingenuity on 
the part of the pupils in working up their presentations. Geog- 
raphy in this school became one of the most interesting subjects 
instead of the least interesting as it had been. 
Sublimation.—The energy aroused in connection with some 
of the strong emotions which may be misdirected, can very 
well be directed into higher channels so to speak, that is, it 
may be sublimated. During my student days I had a type- 
writer which did not do good work. It was not until I found a 
man rooming in the same house whose machine did better work 
than mine that I became somewhat indignant. This was partly 
due to the fact that I had paid a little more for my machine than 
he had for his. The result was that I was determined that 
my typewriter should work as well or better than his and two 
hours spent in taking it apart and putting it together again 
achieved my purpose. The point is that my indignation was 
turned to good account. The boy who likes to fight and who 
feels like fighting may be taught to direct his energy to over- 
coming problems or to protecting weaker companions from the 
school bully, instead of becoming a bully himself. Jealousy 
may be. valuable if it is jealousy for one’s reputation. These 
native tendencies may, with the proper suggestion, be turned to 
good account and the study attitude aroused and interest be 
developed in study.
-P-A-G-E-188

Action and Feeling.—Independent of any theory of emotion, 
the fact is that feelings and attitudes may be aroused by acting 
as though one had them. To be cheerful let one act cheer- 
fully. To be attentive let one go through the motions of attend- 
ing. Repeating the words of the instructor, writing notes, 
talking about the subject, or asking questions, have been found 
to help students. This action is likely to result in an interest 
before one realizes it. 
Centering Interest in the Pupils’ Activity——One of my stu- 
dents reports the following from her experience: “‘The boys in 
my Sunday School come to class every Sunday and sit and 
squirm around without ever listening to anything they are told. 
Last Sunday I turned the whole lesson over to them. It was 
review and was conducted in the following manner. One boy 
started a Bible story and when he had told some of it called on 
another boy. This boy continued and called on someone else. 
When one story was finished they started another and kept that 
going. I did not have to say much of anything and they seemed 
much more attentive and interested than they ever had before. 
They even got interested enough to ask the others to please call 
on them.” 
Motivation through the Activity of the Pupil—A friend of 
mine, a very successful teacher, makes a great deal of use of 
the pupil’s activity. The class visited the local water plant 
recently to get ideas in connection with civics. The trip raised 
many questions about the city government. The interest 
aroused by this trip was sufficient to keep the class discussing 
pertinent problems for several days and led them to look up 
various subjects in their books to find answers to their questions. 
In teaching English this teacher sends his class to look at 
something which is to be described and they then come in and 
write. The class I visited had recently gone to a room which 
was used for teaching wireless telegraphy and then had written a 
description of the room. Preparation for writing narratives 
was made by having pupils ride in an auto, or on a car, or witness 
something which was going on in the busy part of the city; 
they then gave an account of what they had seen. 
These methods of arousing interest succeeded. And they 
had not only the immediate success needed for the writing and 
for the next day’s discussion, but in many cases, if not in most 
cases, did that far more valuable thing. They aroused perma-
-P-A-G-E-189
  INTEREST AND PRIMARY ATTENTION 189 
nent interests and sustained efforts in these subjects. They were 
not dead or semi-remote things existing only in text books. 
They were living realities discovered by the pupils who had been 
physically and mentally active in relation to them. 
“In almost any subject,’’ wrote James, “your passion for your 
subject will save you. If you only care enough for a result, 
you will almost certainly attain it.” Then follows the warning: 
“Only you must not wish at the same time a hundred other 
incompatible things just as strongly.” 
The Development from Interest to Effort.—If it is permissible 
to try to hold attention at first by appeal to the native tendencies 
and interest, it is not permissible to stop at that. No education 
is complete. But any education which fails to include the use 
of effort as well as the use of interest has failed signally in one 
of the essentials. The world calls for those who can work for 
long periods on things that are often not interesting, on things 
that are arduous and unpleasant. And it calls more and more 
for men who can work, not for the immediate satisfying of 
desires, but for ideals. 
We must then look at our problem of bringing about edu- 
cative activity from the point of view of effort. In doing this 
we shall look at the other side, so to speak, of mind. We have 
been looking at the feeling side. In discussing Attention and 
Sustained Effort, we shall look for the most part on the other 
side, for interest and attention are but obverse and reverse of 
the same thing; when we look at the intellectual aspect we find 
attention; when we look at the feeling side we find interest. 
QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY 
1. Show how the actions of an individual are the result of an interaction 
between the stimulus and the tendencies to react. 
2. Show how the teacher’s work is to arouse and direct the activities he 
desires. 
3. Why is unnecessary repression wrong? 
4, Comment on some of the things in and conditions of the present day 
school that make for inactivity and suppression instead of making for 
activity and direction of activity. 
5. What is meant by making the appeal to the student? To what is the 
appeal made, specifically and definitely? 
6. Compare the motivation of school work with the motivation of work done 
outside of the school. Can you see any way or ways in which the moti- 
vation of school work can be made more like that of every-day life where 
men are aroused to do long and arduous tasks?

7. Try to study out for yourself what kinds of appeal you think you could 
most successfully make. 
8. How would kinds of appeal differ because of the age and the mentality 
of the person appealed to?

  CHAPTER 16 
CASE STUDIES AND PRINCIPLES OF STIMULATION: 
VOLUNTARY AND HABITUAL ATTENTION 
From Interest to Effort—The preceding chapter has dealt 
with the arousing of activity which is, for the most part, pleas- 
ant, easy, interesting, and free from that which we may call 
effort on the part of the student. We have just said, if education 
may begin with that which is thus pleasant and interesting, it does 
not follow that all education may be of this softer kind. Such an edu- 
cation has not prepared the student for the difficult, unpleasant, 
arduous tasks of adult life. Those who understand psychology 
and the demands of life, can I think, have no question as to the 
need for this training that requires the student to do some things 
which require effort. 
In the present chapter we shall try to show how the doing of 
the unpleasant, the arduous, that which requires effort on the 
part of the learner, may and often does, grow naturally out of 
the pleasant and interesting activities. Some of the things 
already said and some of the examples already given show this. 
Here we are especially interested in effort, and shall deal with 
the subject so as to show how we may begin with a simple, pri- 
mary kind of attention, how we may at a higher stage of education 
bring about a secondary or voluntary attention, and how this 
higher kind of attention may grow into a derived primary, or 
habitual, attention, which is more stable and sustained than the 
first kind, and which may be accompanied with the pleasantness 
and interest of the first kind. 
The Need for Attention.—Without attention no study! The 
better the attention, the better all intellectual work, observa- 
tion, memory, reasoning, or whatever it may be. Inattention 
has been placed at the top of a list of faults and crimes of school 
children. Many of us have still clear in memory, much clearer 
than the things we were supposed to learn, the request of the 
teacher for our ‘‘undivided attention.” Students have often 
asked me how they could get better habits of concentration, this 
191 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
    192 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
being their greatest difficulty. Nothing, perhaps, disturbs the 
student more than this tendency of the mind to wander. All that 
we have said in the last chapter may apply here but we are now 
to look at the matter definitely from the point of view of attention. 
Kinds or Stages of Attention.—Before attempting to suggest 
methods that have been found to be practically valuable in 
bringing about good attention it will be worth while to note 
the kinds or stages of attention. The student of psychology 
is familiar with the terms “voluntary,” “involuntary,” and “‘non- 
voluntary” in connection with attention. The classification 
of attention which seems most useful for our purpose is that 
of Titchener. He uses the terms “primary,” “secondary,” 
and ‘‘derived primary.’’! 
Primary Attention.—Primary, or as it is sometimes called, 
passive attention, is the kind that is determined by the things 
going on about us. A loud noise, a bright object, a change in 
the sound of the automobile engine, brings this kind of atten- 
tion. This attention is attracted first to one thing and then to 
another; it is held to one thing only if there is not relatively 
greater distraction. It is the kind of attention that we find in 
lower animals, and in people as they walk along the street and 
are led to notice objects in the shop windows. One learns in 
this stage of attention. And one learns many valuable things. 
But the learning is dependent upon the appeal to the mind by 
external things. Anything may distract and the learning be 
interrupted. In animals and young children, we find, for the 
most part, only this kind of attention, and they therefore fail 
in one of the things essential to study. 
The Conditions of Primary Attention.—If the teacher could 
control the mind so as to have this attention to the subjects of 
study whenever and as long as he wished, the task of teaching 
would be as easy as the most hopeful would wish. But the 
passing auto truck, the sounds in the corridor, the memory of 
last night’s dance, the expectation of the picnic next Saturday, 
the subject for debate, the mistake that lost us the game, the 
tendency to think about something in the shop, run the keenest 
competition to the attractions offered by the teacher. 
The conditions that the teacher can use are already taking 
the student along some line of thought. There is never a time 
when a person is not attentive to something if he be awake. 
The problem is to determine the conditions so that attention
-P-A-G-E-193
    VOLUNTARY AND HABITUAL ATTENTION 193 
will be directed to the subject of study. These conditions are 
vividness or intensity, novelty, suddenness, continued repe- 
tition, familiarity, movement, cessation of stimulus, change of 
stimulus, and leaving aside the technicalities of scientific psy- 
chology, interest. 
Vividness or Intensity of the Stimulus.—It is obvious that the 
teacher may make the sound of the voice very forceful and 
not without good results on many occasions. The very ear- 
nestness and forcefulness of many speakers often reach their 
hearers when no other quality is present that would command 
attention. I know one professor who is often called upon to 
give commencement addresses and nothing more than his very 
earnestness holds his audience in close attention. But I also 
remember another professor whose lectures I attended and 
whose intensity missed the mark. He was in the habit of raising 
his voice, pounding upon the desk and reaching a closed fist 
out over the desk where he shook it at the class. My attention 
was attracted to be sure. I sat on the front seat and had the 
full benefit. But my attention more than once was attracted to 
the actions themselves and to the wondering if his white cuff 
would not some day fall off in my lap and I have the pleasure of 
returning it to him. 
Change of Stimulus.—Lowering the voice is often very effec- 
tive. I have often brought a class of boys to quiet by starting 
to talk in a voice so low that they could not hear and found that 
they would stop their noise and ask one another to be quiet 
so as to hear what I had tosay. I recall a very impressive bit of 
advice given me by a teacher in a very low voice; so low, in fact, 
that I had to strain a little to hear. I recall also hearing the same 
teacher make a public address which was a dismal failure. The 
whole reason being that the voice was too low and the effort 
to attend was altogether too great. The changing of the inten- 
sity of the stimulus is then not without its disadvantages, though 
it may sometimes be utilized successfully. 
Novelty.—The discussion of novelty will bring us to see as we 
must how interest is involved in very much of our attention. 
The new attracts attention and it is likely also to be interesting, 
at least, for a short time. Many ways have been successfully 
tried to keep attention through novelty. New questions, 
written instead of oral recitation, debate on the subject, pupils 
questioning, new illustrations, new order, summaries, a new

record to make, applications to a new problem at home, in busi- 
ness, or in the school,—these and many others have proved 
useful. One of my students reports that when other things 
had failed to keep attention and interest in addition, one teacher 
aroused almost tireless effort in the adding of columns of figures 
by using a new incentive. Those who added all the columns 
of figures without making any mistakes were ‘given bank posi- 
tions.”’ Imaginary salaries were also offered. Accuracy and 
speed were soon at a premium. The interest kept up for a long 
time. 
Familiarity—Everyone realizes that the familiar object, or 
idea, or sound is naturally pleasing. As we read the evening 
paper the eye falls on the familiar words and we are pleased 
to look through the articles on familiar topics, that is, of course, 
if we have not already had too much of them. Those who are 
acquainted with children are continually impressed with the 
fact that children ask again and again for the stories they have 
heard until an adult would expect that they had grown tiresome. 
It is true that the new is interesting only when it is related in 
some way with something which is familiar. That which 
arouses the old associations, the old tendencies, is necessary to 
give interest and to hold attention. 
The Concrete.—It must be remembered that these factors 
that determine attention are found best in concrete situations. 
One of the instructors in physics whom I know finds the con- 
crete holds the attention to things not intrinsically interesting. 
What is an erg of work? The student is not aroused to enthu- 
siasm by the question. This instructor brings out the matter 
so as to hold attention throughout. He takes one milligram 
weight on which gravity acts with the force of approximately 
one dyne. He then with seeming effort raises it by means of a 
pair of tweezers, elevates it to the upper surface of a block one 
centimeter high and then informs his class that he has done one 
erg of work by causing a force of one dyne to be exerted through 
a distance of one centimeter. 
The Definite and Concrete.—In a class of children most of 
whom were below the average in mathematical ability, as 
shown by school grades the writer found the following method 
very successful in arousing interest and also clear ideas of the 
problem to be solved. The lesson was to teach how to deter- 
mine the circumference if the diameter were given. The teacher
-P-A-G-E-195
  VOLUNTARY AND HABITUAL ATTENTION 195 
took a piece of wood, one inch square and about twelve inches 
long. With a pair of dividers he described a circle whose cir- 
cumference was tangent with each of the four sides of the square 
end of the stick. 
The teacher then gave the class the dimensions of the piece 
of wood: He then asked how long a string it would take to 
just go around the stick. Next, how long a string would it 
take if the stick were put into a lathe and turned down so that 
it would be round and just the size of the circle which he had 
drawn on the end? Not quite four inches but more than three. 
Well, exactly how long must it be? The teacher had very 
successfully aroused the desire of the pupils to know how to 
solve the problem. 
Contrast this method with the common method of attempting 
to teach problems in mathematics with no such concrete, definite 
presentation to the pupils. Once trying the new is sufficient 
to demonstrate to the teacher its superiority. 
Secondary or Voluntary Attention—We have said that pri- 
mary attention is not likely to be sustained. The tendency to 
study that the teacher is trying to arouse and keep going is all 
the time being interfered with by the tendency of the student 
to respond to all those other stimuli of which we have spoken. 
We say that the mind tends to wander. Most of our educa- 
tion goes on, not in this primary attention, but in secondary 
attention. In other words study is hard work. It requires 
effort. There must be a conflict of impulses and, if the work 
is to go as it should, the impulse to “stick to it,” to go in the 
line of greater resistance, must win. Suppose, then, that the 
student can think his problem through to the end even though 
other things arouse impulses to shift his attention to them. 
He compels himself to write his essay instead of thinking of a 
dance or a football game. He follows the lecture, or outlines 
the chapter notwithstanding the desire to do something else. 
He is working in the stage of secondary, or as it is sometimes 
called, voluntary attention. 
Derived Primary or Habitual Attention—At any time now 
the conflict may cease; there may no longer be any effort to 
attend. The subject, may, so to speak, hold the, student. The 
sound of voices nearby, the noises of the street, the call to 
dinner even, may go unnoticed. The student is now working 
in the stage of derived or, it may be called, habitual attention.
-P-A-G-E-196

196 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
This is a stable, sustained, untroubled attention, in which dis- 
turbances are no longer distractions. This is the attention 
commonly found in the inventor, or the research worker. 
The Conditions of Secondary and Derived Attention. The 
Native Tendencies.—We have already spoken of the tendencies 
that may be aroused and of the feelings that indicate favorable 
conditions for study. The desire to improve, curiosity, emu- 
lation, pride in one’s accomplishments, desire for the approval 
of successful people, dissatisfaction at one’s own shortcomings 
are likely to mean greater efforts. Obviously, if a person is 
sufficiently interested, if he have a passion for the work, the 
attention will almost surely be sustained. It is necessary only 
that the right suggestion, the right appeal of people or things 
or events arouse the desired disposition for study. 
The Arousal of Sustained Attention.—Determination, pur- 
pose, realization of the value of the results of study, the expecta- 
tion of advantage to be gained, are closely related to the best 
kind of attention. I am indebted to Dean Coffman for the story 
of a boy who was aroused to this kind of effort by that more 
vigorous method than is now supposed to be fashionable. The 
boy had been sentenced to one of our state penitentiaries and 
began his record in the institution by breaking the machine at 
which he was put to work. The overseer repaired the machine 
and informed the boy that he would be sent to the superintendent 
if he broke the machine again. Very shortly the boy broke the 
machine again and was sent to the superintendent. The latter 
informed him that he should go back to work and added that in 
case the machine was again broken he would thrash him. The 
boy fulfilled the requirements for the thrashing, received it and 
spent the night pacing his cell. The guards reported that he 
had not slept at all during the night. 
The next day his conduct changed. He went to work and 
from that day worked faithfully. He also began to read and 
study and took the best books he could find from the library. 
His term in the penitentiary was shortened and the day he was 
released he called on the superintendent. Do you remember, 
he asked, the day you thrashed me for breaking a machine? 
Yes. Well, you did not know what I was thinking. No. I 
was thinking that I would be the best citizen that was possible 
or the greatest criminal that the world had ever seen. And I 
decided to be the greatest criminal. I also decided that in
-P-A-G-E-197
  VOLUNTARY AND HABITUAL ATTENTION 197 
order to be the greatest criminal the world had ever known I 
must be well educated and know the things that other people 
knew, so I took the best books I could find. But as I read 
those books they made me think it over again and again and 
finally I concluded that I was wrong. Now I am going out to 
be the best citizen that I can be. 
The point in which I am interested here is that through 
strong measures the boy was brought to the determination to 
study and that long continued effort resulted. I have used 
corporal punishment myself and never without good results; 
sustained effort and good or excellent work followed. But 
one must use judgment and no rule can determine when one 
should use strength or when one might better take a boy for 
an afternoon’s trip as my first case illustrated. Needless to 
say corporal punishment should be used only in the last resort. 
It should never degenerate into the brutality which was the 
just cause for its being thrown into disrepute. 
We would be blind, indeed, if we overlooked the fact that 
human beings are moved as much or more by their pains as 
by the beckonings of pleasure. Pleasure and pain have been 
called the great educators of the world. Fear®® and anger,?? 
if rightly directed, may be counted upon as great educative 
forces. 
The demand for study is not a siren call and the pains and 
discomforts that are necessary to move men to work are appro- 
priate for the same reason as regards study, for study is work. 
Appeal Made through the Removal of Privileges.—A few 
years ago one of our Minneapolis judges told of a delinquent 
whom he had sent to the reformatory. The boy seemed to be 
utterly hardened. No appeal reached him. Nothing would 
bring him to a desire to obey the authorities. Later they began 
to remove privileges, one after another, to see if they could 
find anything that would touch a tender spot. Finally they 
refused to let him see his mother. This was the thing for which 
he really cared and he soon promised and performed faithfully 
all the authorities desired. 
==—-—Appeal to an Habitual Tendency.—The appeal to an habitual 
tendency often brings the desired result. A principal of one 
of the Minnesota high schools told me of a boy who absolutely 
refused to work for a certain teacher. He told the principal 
that she was “down on him,’ she was unjust to him; would

not give him a chance; he did not intend to do any work for 
her and did not care if he failed in the subject. The principal 
had noticed that he was always courteous to ladies. He at 
once appealed to the boy to consider her not as a teacher but 
as a lady and to realize that even if she were unjust it would 
be well for him to think not of teacher and pupil, but of gen- 
tleman and lady and to take the initiative. This appealed to 
the boy and a reconciliation was effected. 
The Passing of Secondary Attention into Derived Primary 
Attention.—The derived primary, which is an absorbed, sus- 
tained, attention is the best kind for study. It comes about 
when the conflict of impulses ceases; when the ideas present, 
the determination, the purpose, win out over the distractions 
and there is no longer the effort to attend. This happens 
when the conditions of secondary attention are strong enough 
to hold attention relatively independent of distraction. Any 
of the factors that arouse interest and hold attention may do 
this; they must do it so that the disposition to continue remains. 
On the nervous side we have, in this highest stage of attention, 
permanent dispositions to work or study or to attend along certain 
lines. 
The Best Attention Is Had with Slight Distraction—Not only 
in every day work but in the laboratory it is found that the 
best attention is had when some slight distraction is present. . 
It is this disturbance that seems to be necessary to arouse one 
to real effort. The overcoming of some difficulty means more 
earnest endeavor. It may be that the student will do wellto 
practice studying where there is considerable noise; not that 
the distraction helps the study but that the ability to study in 
any kind of a situation is worth developing into a habit. The 
ability of students to study in the old fashioned country school, 
or even in many schools now where there is a recitation going 
on, is well worth remembering. One might say then, that for 
the best attention, one should have slight distraction; but for 
developing the habit of concentration one- should practice 
studying in any and every kind of a situation in which one finds 
oneself. 
Hindrances to Good Attention: The Feeling of Fatigue, vs. 
Fatigue.—Professor Thorndike summarizes a study of mental 
fatigue as follows: “Six subjects worked continuously from 
three to eight hours on the mental manipulation of one three-
-P-A-G-E-199
  VOLUNTARY AND HABITUAL ATTENTION 199 
place number by another. Ten subjects worked from four to 
twelve hours with pauses for meals. All subjects did from a 
half-hour’s to an hour’s work on a following day. Only three 
out of the sixteen subjects did as well at the end of work as 
after rest. The greatest fatigue effect came after a work 
period of about five hours, the smallest (except in the three 
negative cases) after a work period of almost nine hours. The 
subjects who were most efficient and worked most rapidly 
showed a smaller loss through fatigue than did the less effi- 
cient workers. Inspection of the records shows that the results 
are probably a compound of a gradually decreasing practice 
effect with a gradually increasing fatigue effect. There 
seems to be “little correlation between the fact of fatigue and 
the feeling of fatigue.”42 An excellent study of fatigue has been 
made by Offner.7? 
It is well to understand the distinction between fatigue and 
the feeling of fatigue. Weariness, or the feeling of fatigue, 
is generally followed by a wandering of the attention and a 
general relaxation of effort. Recent studies of fatigue, as the 
above quotation indicates, prove that the feeling of fatigue 
can be pushed back for an astonishingly long time and that 
excellent work can continue much longer than we commonly 
suppose. Laziness and habit probably account for the unneces- 
sarily early onset of weariness which is popularly confused with 
fatigue itself. Fatigue, let it be remembered, is actual ineffi- 
ciency or lack of ability for further work, and it is not to be 
thought of as synonomous with the feeling of fatigue; nor is the 
latter to be considered a safe indication of real fatigue. 
When the feeling of fatigue caused, perhaps, as it often is, 
by nothing more than a dislike for the work in hand, wears 
off, one may go on for hours and do as well as, or better than, 
he did before the onset of the feeling. Less attention to feel- 
ings would be better for most of us; nevertheless, denial of 
fatigue and disregard of weariness after a reasonable period of 
study, is extreme and hazardous; a tendency in that direction 
today, seems to indicate a misinterpretation of the results of 
fatigue experiments and a dangerous attitude so far as health is 
concerned. 
Emotional and Intellectual Factors.—Needless to say exciting 
emotions disturb study. Adolescent changes are correlated 
with some retardation in school work. So far as possible these  
-P-A-G-E-200
    200 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
disturbing factors should be eliminated and, where this is impos- 
sible, they should be reduced to a minimum. 
Study is also disturbed by other factors of a different nature. 
Students are often troubled by not knowing just what to do neat; 
or by failing to have clearly in mind just how to proceed. This is 
well illustrated by an incident that happened in one of our 
Minneapolis schools a short time ago. The teacher had taught 
a lesson in arithmetic and then told the class to do all the exam- 
ples on a certain page but to omit the first. One boy failed to 
get started and finally the teacher went over to him and asked 
just what the trouble was. At last he admitted: “I don’t know 
how to omit the first.” The case may be rare but the kind of 
difficulty is typical of many instances where the mind wanders. 
Lack of Technique and of Instruments.—Getting started, 
finding instruments, pencil, pen, or what not, divert attention 
and according to Breslich!! ten to fifteen minutes are often 
wasted by high school students getting down to work. The 
difficulties in the actual doing continually tend to break up 
sustained effort. Again and again one can observe in the lab- 
oratory a student who has not the technique, and who fails or 
does work clumsily and then turns to watch someone else. 
Bad Suggestions and Failure to Try.—If good suggestions are 
valuable to help the student get into a study attitude and to 
study with sustained effort, it is also of importance that sugges- 
tions to listlessness and ease be eliminated so far as possible. 
Many people fail to do things merely because they fail to try. 
And they may fail to try simply because of the lack of incentive 
and the presence of suggestions to ease and comfort. One should 
not hesitate to get away from the wrong suggestions be they 
places or persons, to seek the stimulating environment and then 
to try. To move the lips, to take up the pen, to begin to say the 
lesson to oneself, if nothing more to make believe one is studying, 
may be all that is necessary to bring on a study fit.‘4 
Self Government and Sustained Effort.—Responsibility and 
the feeling that it is my work are important factors in conduct. 
In a small high school, of about 60 or 70 students, there had 
been a great deal of trouble and very poor discipline. The 
school work had necessarily suffered very much. The diffi- 
culty was due partly to the activities of a ‘‘gang,’”’ and partly 
to the fact that the teachers had failed to “‘reach” or make the 
right appeal to the students.
-P-A-G-E-201
  VOLUNTARY AND HABITUAL ATTENTION 201 
Finally a young man who believed in self government was 
made superintendent. He told the young people that he expected 
them to govern themselves. At first chaos reigned. Soon 
the leaders of the gang called a meeting of the entire student 
body. <A self governing association was formed. Today it is 
one of the best governed high schools. 
As one of the students said: These people who had never 
been interested in school activities, because they thought the 
teachers were running them, formed clubs. One, a literary 
club which has given some enjoyable entertainments, was the 
cause of a fine victrola being placed in the assembly room. 
Another literary club has established a school paper which is 
published once a month. The students have entire charge of 
these things and because they feel that they control the enter- 
prises and are responsible, they take great interest in making 
everything the best possible. 
Self Government Aided by a School Paper.—An eighth grade 
class in one of the public schools of St. Paul publishes a school 
magazine every month. The pupils formerly had it typewritten. 
Now the father of one of the boys has it printed for the class. 
A large portion of the class are on the staff. They have some 
worth while poetry, a few original essays, school news, personals, 
and jokes as well as editorials. 
Through the columns the children try to enforce self govern- 
ment. They comment on the fact that they have “found two 
boys who cannot be trusted out of Miss ’s sight.”” ‘‘Lost 
some time from study, because a member of the class acted 
up.” They state that they want “brighter boots and smoother 
hair at nine A.M.” They also want ‘‘Less home study for over - 
Saturday, Sunday, and other holidays.” They want their 
room to be “‘as nearly a perfect room as we can make it.”” One 
item said that ‘A certain person should worry more about his 
character. Most of us would be ashamed if the reading teacher 
had to speak to us.” 
There are also comments on good work done, such as, ‘We 
have all noticed how well the boards look after —--——— has 
washed them.” Mention of those who have done good work 
frequently appears in the editorial column. 
The children do very well in getting out this little magazine. 
They take aaah delight in all the work and do not object to 
writing essays or to any task which may be theirs to help in   
 
-P-A-G-E-202
    202 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
getting the material ready. They encourage the best actions 
in the school and plainly show their disapproval of bad acts.” 
A Teacher’s Personal Interest, Trust, and Right Direction of a 
Boy’s Activities —John was a bright active boy in the eighth 
grade. He liked to ‘‘cut up,” and although not malicious was 
a great disturbance. He was very stubborn and both teachers 
and parents failed to get him to conduct himself as he should. 
He often did not realize the wrongs he did. He learned that 
threats that were made were not carried out, and he became 
openly defiant and distrustful. 
Finally he got to high school and entered a week late. His 
new teacher found out what he wanted and made out his pro- 
gram. She also made arrangements to meet him to help him 
make up the work he had lost. At the times she met him in 
this way she learned what John wanted to be when he got older. 
He wanted to be a doctor, and she advised him about his course, 
told him about the course at the university and how hard it was 
and how hard he would have to study to get through it. She 
also impressed him with the necessity of learning to study while 
in high school in order that he might be able to do the work when 
he entered the university. She paid little attention to his pranks 
and drew his attention to the things he should do and could do. 
Her sincere interest in his desires and ambitions and her confi- 
dence in him coupled with her doing exactly what she said she 
would, won his respect and confidence in her. His attitude 
changed for the better and he became an earnest student. 
Sharing in Activities ——Throughout high school a certain class 
was noted for its many class “scraps.’’ It seemed impossible 
for the class to plan anything without some group making trouble. 
If one group had charge, other members of the class would 
criticise the arrangements. Groups formed so that members 
of one group were continually at odds with members of other 
groups. During the senior year a girl was elected president of the 
class who solved the difficulty by giving each individual some 
part in arrangements for the class activities. The first class affair 
was a party given by the class for the faculty. The president 
chose as chairman of the committees the girls who had made 
trouble; each chairman elected his or her own committee. By 
dividing the work sufficiently all of the members of the class had 
some share and as a result no trouble arose and the best party of 
the four years took place.  
-P-A-G-E-203
  VOLUNTARY AND HABITUAL ATTENTION 203 
Pride and Interest in One’s Own Achievement.—One teacher 
was very much interested in teaching nature. In order to get 
the class interested she divided the class into sections and gave 
each section a plot of ground for a garden. LEach section was 
to try to have the prettiest garden and to do it without help. 
Interest in the gardens was great and competition keen as each 
group wanted to have the best garden. Each child seemed to 
have the interest and pride of ownership and of achievement. 
Appeal to Sympathy and. the Sense of Responsibility.—During 
a study of classroom methods by one of my students, the following 
example of successful appeal to an unruly class was discovered. 
I give it nearly in the words of the report. One of the teachers of 
a grade school in a small town was having her first experience 
with an unruly class, mostly boys. She had tried every means 
of correction of which she could think but failed. Her pupils 
knew she was inexperienced so were “‘trying her out,’’ and from 
their point of view, were succeeding admirably. One afternoon, 
tired and discouraged, she decided to resort to a last measure. 
When the pupils assembled after recess she told them that she 
felt so ill that probably she could not be there the next day, but 
that they were to come and to try to get a few exercises done by 
themselves. Also, if they had time and wanted to, they were 
to make a map which she explained to them. She stated that it 
would please her if they would be as quiet as possible and try not 
to disturb the other rooms. With this she dismissed the class 
early and went home leaving the children with the feeling that 
they would be responsible for their own actions. 
When she returned, the exercises were written and placed 
on her desk. Most of the children had finished maps. Favor- 
able reports came from the other teachers who had been asked 
not to interfere unless the room got too noisy. During the 
day she had several inquiries concerning her health, and one 
or two of the most “desperate” boys even said that they were 
sorry that they had caused her trouble. After that the room 
seemed a different place. Each student felt that he was respon- 
sible for any disturbance of the class and there was little trouble 
from that time. 
A Position of Responsibility—A certain young man had been 
at the St. Cloud Reformatory in Minnesota for several years. 
He was twenty-two years of age. On three occasions he had 
broken his parole. Each time he had been caught and returned 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  204 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
to the institution. Finally the superintendent thought he saw 
possibilities of another kind in him and made him manager of the 
dining room in the reformatory. A change was soon apparent. 
The boy saw to it that things went on as they should in the dining 
room and his own conduct changed greatly. So well did he 
succeed that he was given his dismissal from the institution a 
year later. 
Improvement from Within.—A fundamental principle which 
appears in many studies is illustrated in the following case. 
This principle is one that is not at all new, but is held alto- 
gether too much in theory alone. Not what some outsider 
does for a group, but what the group does for itself, is the important 
thing. What the group decides, what it works for, it values and 
is ready to defend. 
In one of the schools of Minneapolis where most of the children 
were Scandanavian, there happened to be a little Italian boy. 
The children fell into the habit of teasing him. He was especially 
sensitive about his inability to speak English very well. The 
teasing continued until the children had worked him up to the 
point of chasing them with an open knife which he threatened to 
use on them. After an actual attempt to stab one of the boys 
a teacher called the children together and told them that she 
thought they should take up the matter, have a court and jury 
and decide what should be done. 
A judge and jury were chosen from among the offending 
boys. The matter of justice was placed in the hands of the 
jury. The tormentors told their story and the Italian boy told 
his. The jury decided that the American citizens had placed 
the foreign boy in a very disadvantageous position inasmuch 
as he knew the English language but little. They decided that 
they had not given him a square deal and the verdict was, in 
their own words, “Give the dago a chance.” A short time 
afterwards the Italian boy, who had been accepted as one of the 
crowd, was making rapid progress in adapting to the new group. 
The boys had solved their problem and the friction disappeared. 
The Direction of Attention.—What shall be noticed, remem- 
bered, understood, and the accuracy and faithfulness of memory 
depend upon the things that are attended to. There is the 
question of the attitude of the student and of the presence or 
absence of goal ideas. Goal ideas may be either useful or 
harmful. If one wishes to make an exhaustive study of an
-P-A-G-E-205
  VOLUNTARY AND HABITUAL ATTENTION 205 
object, a reaction in chemistry or the anatomy of a tissue, definite 
ideas of what he is to see may too much limit the attention and 
cause important things to be overlooked; again, the knowledge 
of what should appear aids in the actual finding of what is 
expected. But again, and it cannot be too much emphasized, the 
observer may see or think he sees things which are not there if 
he only has sufficiently strong expectation of them. 
Briefly, economy is gained in the discovery of things if one 
has definite ideas of what he is looking for, which means that the 
field of exploration is limited and attention is relieved of much 
which is beside the mark. But one should never limit the atten- 
tion by expectation to such an extent that he cannot observe the 
entirely new, that which has not been imagined or expected, 
but which, however, may be very valuable. 
Control of Action through Control of Attention.—A social 
worker found a group of boys who were trying to tie a tin can 
on a dog’s tail. ‘‘Boys,”’ he said, ‘‘I can show you how to tie a 
knot that won’t come untied.” The boys gathered around 
him. The knot was demonstrated. ‘I can show you the best 
kind of a knot for tying a horse so that he cannot get away.” 
The boys became very much interested and the dog made good 
his escape. Pieces of rope and string were produced and the 
boys began to learn how to tie different kinds of knots. The 
dog was forgotten and they found a new interest in learning how 
to do something worth while. 
The Directing of Native Tendencies.—An excellent illustra- 
tion of the result of good leadership and the utilizing of native 
tendencies was reported to me as follows: ‘‘In Litchfield, Minn., 
there was at one time a crowd of boys, from fifteen to eighteen 
years of age, who, though not bad, were a cause of many great 
annoyances to the town. They were not really bad, but 
extremely mischievous. There came to the town a new Meth- 
odist minister. Though not particularly successful as a preacher, 
he liked boys and knew how to manage them. Ina short time 
he had organized these boys into an athletic association, organized 
in the first place, merely for play and games, but rapidly it 
became a club for organized athletics. The Y. M. A. C., or 
Young Men’s Athletic Club, as it was called began to talk over 
the town affairs, social work and politics, as they heard the older 
men talk. When state elections came they were as interested 
in the outcome as were their fathers. As soon as they were well
-P-A-G-E-206
    206 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
organized, the minister stepped out of the executive staff and 
allowed the boys to govern themselves entirely, coming to him 
only for advice as they wished it. 
“As their interest in the club grew, their interest in the town’s 
welfare grew, and they became a potent factor in maintaining 
order in Litchfield. An ordinance had been passed that no 
storekeeper could have sign boards or advertisements of any 
kind out on the side walks cluttering up the streets. When- 
ever the boys saw any such advertisements, they reported the 
storekeepers to the town authorities. At home they had heard 
their mother talk of the uncleanliness of having fruit, etc., on 
open stands in front of fruit stores. The boys took the matter 
in hand and fairly boycotted one Greek who insisted on keep- 
ing fruit uncovered. They carried their protests to such an 
extent that the authorities finally took it up and issued an 
ordinance prohibiting food to be displayed on uncovered stands. 
“The loyalty of the boys to one another and the harmony and 
zest with which they worked under their sixteen year old 
president was a marvel to the inhabitants. Although they 
joked at a club for such young boys, they soon found them- 
selves and their town greatly benefitted by the work of the 
organization.” 
The Value of a Purpose.—Meumann, in his book, The Psy- 
chology of Learning, says that having a purpose seems to make 
for better and easier accomplishment. From the laboratory 
to everyday life the ability to connect a smaller work with 
some larger purpose makes it easier to do and seems to bring 
better results. So much is this so that he concludes that there 
is here a universal law of mind. Here we find the results of 
stimulation incorporated into the disposition of the mind, the 
ideal and purpose becoming motives and the urge from within 
replaces that from without. 
A boy may fail in school, but if he has a purpose, may make 
a great success in life; or your honor student, lacking a pur- 
pose and determination, may go down in failure in later years. 
Purpose and determination turn failure into success, and the 
world is a place in which men wrest victory from defeat. It 
is often noted as students go on into high school and into col- 
lege that, as they acquire a purpose, their work shows a cor- 
responding improvement. Why is it that many students, as 
they begin their professional work show the ability to do a
-P-A-G-E-207
  VOLUNTARY AND HABITUAL ATTENTION 207 
quality of work that they have never before shown? Partly 
because of higher requirements. But it is safe to assert that, 
for a very larger number, the improvement is due to the develop- 
ing of a definite aim, purpose, determination. A recent research 
gives results of recall with and without determination to recall; 
and shows that the presence of determination to recall may 
improve the actual recall by as much as 147 per cent.”° 
QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY 
1. If education may begin with the pleasant and interesting and easy, why 
should it not end with these? Show fully and carefully what more is 
necessary and why. 
2. How does the psychology of attention show the “higher results” that 
should be obtained through education? 
8. Explain the need of attention for all learning of whatsoever kind. 
4. Give examples to show how you would get each of the three kinds or 
stages of attention. 
5. How far does the control of attention settle the problem of discipline 
and of better school work? 
6. Compare the results of teaching in the abstract and in the concrete. 
Take examples from your own experience. 
7. Isit right to say, in teaching always begin with the concrete and end with 
the abstract? 
8. Do you think that the school provides sufficiently for training students 
to do long and arduous tasks? Discuss this. 
9. Discuss the problem of interest in connection with school work. How 
can the teacher obtain it? How can he teach the student to obtain it? 
10. Cite some examples in your experience where sustained effort was 
brought about, (1) by arousing interest, (2) by coercion. 
11. Explain the value of getting continued attention and effort of a group 
by helping it to make changes from within the group rather than because 
of coercion from without. 
12. How far can one control attention and thereby action by arousing ideas 
and purposes?

CHAPTER 17 
STIMULATION FOR CREATIVE EDUCATION 
  The Inspiring Stimulus.—It has been said of William James 
that students would talk with him and go away with the idea 
that they had never done as good thinking before. And it is 
quite likely that the stimulus of James did help their thinking, 
and, perhaps, that they did do better thinking than they had 
ever done before. This was part of James’ philosophy of life: 
to help the other man to think his own thought. 
The function of the teacher in the higher type of education 
of which we have earlier spoken is just this stimulation, this 
inspiring, this arousing of the pupil to do his best; and, indeed, 
this is a very large part of the function of the teacher in any 
type of education from the earliest years through the university. 
If through suggestion undesirable epidemics, dancing, hysterical 
outbreaks, tremors, trembling, the making of peculiar sounds, 
coughing, etc., can spread through a community or a gathering, 
it is just as true that desirable behavior can be aroused through 
appropriate stimulation. 
The expert workman in the shop arouses students to do as well 
as they can; the helpful word of a sympathetic teacher inspires 
the student to write for a college publication, something he would 
never have had the courage to attempt without a word of encour- 
agement; a professor suggests to a student that he apply for a 
fellowship, something he had not thought of for himself, and he 
appraises himself more worthily; a talk before a student body 
opens up new vistas and new possibilities to a score of students. 
This is education of the higher type: stimulating individuals to 
attempt that which they would otherwise never have thought of 
trying or had the courage to essay. 
Importance of Motor Result.—In considering such stimulation 
as that which is the main point of this chapter we must take into 
account the fact that stimuli are needed which lead to the motor 
result, to actual doing, and must realize fully that stimulation 
which fails to reach this final consummation fails to contribute 
208
-P-A-G-E-209
  STIMULATION FOR CREATIVE EDUCATION 209 
to this creative education of the highest type. Stimuli that arouse 
the emotions and leave the individual in the midst of his feelings 
are examples of this failure: the moving picture, the theatrical 
performance, the sentimental novel, frequently arouse the 
emotions which do not find their effects in modified behavior 
but merely in enjoyment of the feelings themselves and in a desire 
for further emotional indulgence and gratification. In the 
intellectual field the situation may arouse one to discriminate, 
to criticize, to split hairs to the point of weakening the emotional 
reaction and the disposition to act in any effectual way. Litera- 
ture is thus frequently despoiled of its beauty and effectiveness 
and the students interest more or less deadened. The micro- 
scopic analysis of Shakespeare has effectually killed him for 
many a student; the reading of parts by different students, how- 
ever crude and however painful to the mature critic, has given 
other students a permanent love for his plays. 
Kinds of Inspiring Stimulation.—What are the kinds of stimu- 
lation that lead to this more desirable result? The real life 
situations; the stimuli of love, of war, of new responsibilities, of 
great events, personalities and suggestions. Not the artificial 
schoolroom situations in which the child is required to obtain 
his solution by the one and only method known by the inade- 
quately prepared teacher; but the situation in which the indi- 
vidual is rewarded for finding a new method of solution for himself. 
Not the deadly following of a predigested laboratory manual, 
but the situation in which the manual first trains to the necessary 
technique and then throws the student increasingly upon his 
own responsibility. Not the situation in which the child finds 
his work done for him by the teacher or parent, but the situation 
in which he is helped to help himself; in which he is encouraged 
to realize that he can do things for himself, and in which he is 
stimulated just enough to keep at his problem until he has 
brought the thing to a finish, to a solution, successful, at least, 
on his own level of development and accomplishment. 
Is this boy the worst truant in the school? Make him the 
truant officer for his group. Is that boy the most disobedient 
in the room? Put him in charge of discipline and make it his 
responsibility. Is another the most destructive and careless 
you have ever seen? Assign to that one the care of a part of the 
school property and express a real trust and confidence. Is this 
student indifferent and without purpose or plan? Tell him what
-P-A-G-E-210
  210 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
you think he can do; get him to try something in which he can 
get a taste of success: write an article for a school publication, or 
become a leader in a school organization. 
Motives and the Attitude of Utility—Involved in the stimula- 
tion to the higher type of education are ideas, ideals, purposes, 
which can act as motives. Here, perhaps, we find the crux of 
the problem of what has been called voluntary action, namely, 
conduct guided by ends or purposes as contrasted with behavior 
as scientifically necessitated. If this means that we are obliged 
to assume a position of indeterminism,* to leave the position 
of determinism and of science, and to work in a purposive 
universe, it may be inconsistent, it may be illogical, but also, 
it may be more nearly true to the facts. Possibly all the facts 
of human psychology can be dealt with under the deterministic 
assumption of science. If they cannot, let us be frank and admit 
that we are outside the realm of science in dealing with a small 
per cent. of them and be frankly indeterministic and unscientific. 
*If for the lay reader the statements in the text are sufficient, it is not 
inappropriate to make a little fuller explanation of the point of view of the 
author for the professional reader. For science there is no freedom of the 
will, no indeterminism, and thus for scientific psychology there cannot be 
either. Science by its very assumption of determinism, implying prediction 
and control, rules out indeterminism, for it undertakes to deal with its 
problems under the concept that for a given set of conditions, one result and 
only one can possibly follow. When, therefore, one writes in terms of 
indeterminism he has, either with or without clear understanding of what 
he is doing, stepped outside the scientific world, and is dealing with his 
problems from some non-scientific point of view: that of the technician, the 
teleologist, the artist, the moralist, or what not. 
To ask whether or not all problems of scientific psychology can be solved 
under the assumption of determinism is irrelevant; it is the task of scientific 
psychology to hold to its determinism and to do all it can in terms of deter- 
minism; its task is to deal with all the problems of psychology under the 
concept of determinism whether or not it can succeed. If, now, the tech- 
nician finds practical utility in taking a non-scientific point of view, the 
deterministic scientist has as little to say against such procedure, as the 
technician has against the procedure of the scientist. As a matter of fact 
one and the same individual may take either or both points of view. Asa 
scientist I take without reserve the view of determinism; as regards some 
problems of education I believe that the assumption of a small amount of 
indeterminism may have practical utility and thus far have justification. 
If, for any reason whatsoever, one permits himself to deal with his problems 
under the concept of indeterminism he needs to beware of the danger of 
falling back into the superstition, magic and mysticism from which his 
science has saved him.

STIMULATION FOR CREATIVE EDUCATION 211 
This, however, may not be as unscientific as might, at first sight, 
appear. Although the purposive psychology that has so far 
appeared is as unsatisfactory as may be, nevertheless, it may 
have an element of truth, and if the successful administration of 
educational problems demands a faith and action in terms of 
indeterminism, along with the faith and action in terms of deter- 
minism, it may not be forsaking the scientist’s determination to 
discover the truth if we work this assumption for what it is worth 
and discover its possibilities and limitations. Taking such an 
attitude however tentatively does not mean that we should 
return to the mythology, mysticism and magic of prescientific 
days; but that, taking the results of scientific psychology as the 
foundation and as the main line of attack, we consider also in 
the voluntary aspect of man’s reactions the possibility of a small 
bit of freedom. 
Such an attitude may help us to accept with fuller sympathy 
the suggestion of Burnham! of the essentials of education 
namely, “a task, a plan, and freedom.” It is this attitude that 
may give us more patience to consider the element of truth in the 
chapters of Professor Miller’s Directed Study.** 
A Non-scientific Attitude.—If now there appears to be some 
justification for assuming along with our scientific attitude of 
determinism, the attitude of indeterminism and utility, let us 
be clear that we are taking the non-scientific attitude of use and 
ask how it may help us. It may help us to more of hope and cour- 
age in place of too final an idea of fatalism. This, indeed, if I 
understand him is what Professor Bagley is contending for when 
he objects to the fatalism of the I. Q. Not at all to the use of 
the test methods, but an objection to the misuse of interpretation 
of their results. We must be careful in our interpretation of the 
results of examinations so as to be able to recognize the possibili- 
ties of those who test low. Marks or grades in examinations, 
for example, are not accurate indications of what individuals 
can do.8* The mediocre man, so classified by test methods, may 
by determination and application outstrip some of the A and B 
grade men both in college and in after life. The stimuli of envi- 
ronment, the great teachers, the inspiring personalities, the 
“chance” suggestions of the right kind at the right moment, may 
inspire the average man to do his best while many a better man 
is doing much less well than hecould. The purposive, courageous 
attitude may help many a teacher to call upon the pupil to do
-P-A-G-E-212
  212 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
what he can and to really arouse him to doit. In the matter of 
discipline we find a growing tendency to develop the inner 
motives to take the place of external authority and coercion. 
Such stimulation to the arousal of the inner factors which work 
towards self control are a part of our tendency towards demo- 
cratic government. And writes Smith: ‘The source of authority 
and the methods of its administration may have been shifted 
from autocracy to democracy, but, as a matter of fact, it yet 
remains to be shown that the youth of to-day is less well con- 
trolled than were his ancestors.’’§% 
The Conservative Effect of Habit—When we think of this 
higher type of education and of the stimulation to it we cannot 
fail to note that the conservative effect of habit is very much 
against it. The rising generation would progress faster towards 
the new conceptions and improved methods if the older genera- 
tion would help them or at least would act less as obstructions 
than is the general practice. Customs and traditions hold 
sway and come as binding influences to the young. Hence it is 
often found that the informal education of non-scholastic books 
and individuals and experiences do more to arouse the student to 
realize his best possibilities than the more mechanical methods 
of the regular ‘Gnstitutions of learning.”’ These institutions are 
trying to improve their methods and so we may now turn our 
attention to “supervised study.” 
QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY 
1. Give some concrete illustrations of how the teacher can stimulate for 
originality and creative activity. 
2. What is the importance of the motor result?

in the school may become great leaders? 
4. In what ways are tests valuable? In what ways are they unable to give 
information upon which prediction can be made? 
5. What are the factors besides intelligence that make for success in life and 
in school? 
6. What are some of the obstacles to the higher type of education referred 
to in this chapter?

CHAPTER 18 
THE DIRECTING OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
Results of Supervised Study.—No doubt seems to exist as to 
the need for supervised study. The amount of agreement that 
we should have it, is at least, out of proportion to the amount 
of directed study that has occurred, unless it be in the last few 
years. It appears that we might with profit hear less for a 
time about the very important matter of preparing the teacher 
to teach, and hear more about preparing the student to study, 
and the teacher to help him to study. 
The justification of supervised study lies partly in the recog- 
nized need for it and partly in the fact that it has proved its 
worth where it has been tried and used. Study that is not 
supervised or properly directed is wasteful. Bad habits of 
study are thus formed. Supervised study has given results so 
far superior to the old wasteful ways of pupils,—they can hardly 
be called methods in many cases,—that no teacher who knows 
the facts can deny the economy of such supervision. The 
same lessons can be mastered in less time and bad habits of 
study avoided. Breslich is authority for the statement that 
supervised study may give results even two and one-half times 
superior to unsupervised study if we think of results in terms of 
time. 
Moral Value of Home Study Habits.—Notwithstanding the 
recognized superiority of supervised study at school, there 
remains a very serious moral problem. It appears that in one 
place where home study was abolished, parents discovered that 
their children spent their evenings away from home instead 
of at home as they had done formerly. The problem is serious. 
The endeavor of educators today is to direct the activities of 
children for a larger number of hours out of every twenty-four. 
The street, the movie, all that influences children when they are 
not at home or in school is part of the educational problem. At 
these times they are forming habits; many of which may be 
exceedingly bad. The point is that a little home work may be 
213
-P-A-G-E-214
    y 
-* FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
y of great value in getting pupils to form better habits of spending 
the evening hours. 
The Pupil’s Failure in the Application of Advice for Methods 
of Study.—Parker cites the case of a teacher who gave instruc- 
tions to pupils as to methods of studying and found out later 
that one of these pupils knew nothing about studying the sub- 
ject the teacher taught. The girl told her parents that she 
knew of no suggestions that the teacher had given about how 
to study the lesson. The parents inquired of the teacher and 
learned that such suggestions had been given. It is a question 
how frequent such cases are. From our general knowledge 
we may suppose that this case is by no means exceptional. 
The only safe thing for the teacher is not only to give the 
instructions but to know that they are carried out. Supervised 
study in the school will give opportunity for the teacher to 
know this. It is also advisable that part of the recitation be 
on the methods used in getting the lessons. Not only should 
children know the lesson, they should know how they learned 
it and be able to tell how they did it. The habits of study are 
some of the most important end results of education. Tests 
should include these habits formed as well as the habits that 
are commonly tested. 
The Teacher’s Inability to Advise.—As Judd has pointed out, 
teachers do not know what to tell students about how to study. 
He gives the example of a principal who arranged with his 
teachers for a separate period during which the teachers should 
direct students in the methods of getting their lessons efficiently 
and economically. ‘The program . . . was arranged and the 
classes met the teachers. Then it was discovered that the 
teachers did not know what to say to the students. Teachers 
know about Latin and mathematics. They can ask questions 
in these subjects; but they do no know about students’ minds in 
a way which makes it possible to tell students how to study.” 
Teachers fail to know the difficulties of students. They 
should know these difficulties and the particular difficulties of 
students in the subjects taught. Knowing these they should 
learn to apply the particular knowledge of method needed. 
For the last four years the present writer has given sugges- 
tions for study to his students, especially to those students who 
were preparing to teach. The following suggestions were 
written out about three years ago and have been found very
-P-A-G-E-215
  DIRECTING OF LEARNING AND STUDY 215 
useful in his talks to teachers. They are here given in almost 
the same form as that in which they have been used for the 
last three years. They suggest many of the things that can be 
said to students in the attempt to improve their methods of 
study. Choice can be made from the list of suggestions which 
follow. Many of them will be of great value to students, espe- 
cially if the teacher amplify upon the statements where neces- 
sary. The detailed facts found in the earlier chapters of this 
book will offer the necessary help for such amplification. 
Suggestions for Students.— What you study is very important. 
How you study is more important. What you study you may 
forget ina short time. You will very likely forget a good deal of 
it. How you learn, the methods you use, become habits that 
are a very part of you. These habits stick through life. If you 
get good habits of study you can learn very much more quickly. 
And you will also be better able to learn things by yourself 
when there is no teacher to help you. 
You have often heard about learning to use the hands. It is 
more important to learn to use the mind. Learning to use the 
mind correctly helps you to use the hands better. This makes 
the mental habits that are necessary for success in school and 
after you leave school. Whatever you think, feel, or do, 
develops in you the tendency for you to think, feel, and do the 
same later. That is, it makes your habits of thinking, feeling, 
and doing. If you form good habits they help you to succeed; 
if you form poor habits, they hinder you. 
Remember that you must not simply listen to these sug- 
gestions and decide to use them sometime. You should use 
them now and all the time. You will have to use them until 
they become habits. (You should realize that your old methods 
are probably not economical. If a new method seems harder to 
you it is probably simply because it is new to you. When you 
get used to it it will save you time and be easier. 
Do not be prejudiced against these new methods. They 
have been worked out by people who have studied the best 
ways of doing things. These people are giving you these results 
after much study and many experiments. You are the one to be 
benefited if you will only use them. They studied these problems 
of study because the old ways wasted too much time. 
Habit.—Making a thing a habit permits you to do what you 
have learned in this way and to attend to the next new problem.
-P-A-G-E-216
  216 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
Progress and mastery demand many useful habits, and, especially, 
as many as possible in one’s chosen profession or vocation. 
Always learn correctly the first time; never learn incorrectly; 
things once learned can never be entirely unlearned. 
Your habits will determine, for the most part, what you will 
be and do in the future; develop, therefore, the habits of thinking, 
feeling, and doing that will be helpful later. 
Fully make your habits. Learn the things that will help you 
best to form difficult habits and make use of them. 
Learn the things that interfere with the formation of habits 
in your case and do your best to avoid them, for example, laziness, 
not caring enough, too many engagements, not having time, 
and the like. 
Remember that what you are getting out of your education 
are habits of some kind and that you want good habits rather 
than bad ones; habits that will save you time and effort, rather 
than habits that will waste your time and effort. 
Fully formed habits are what give stability to character. 
One is expert only when one has many of these fully formed 
habits. Such habits are the only things that can be depended 
upon in the emergencies of life. That is what makes the trained 
soldier more valuable than the raw recruit. That is the reason 
that the football squad has to practice so long and so hard. 
Habit Formation Involving Study.—Get a good start and start 
promptly. Don’t waste time beginning. Half a minute is 
probably long enough to take to get started. 
In the problems of life three things above everything else 
will be valuable to you: the ability to gather facts, the ability 
to get clear ideas, and the ability to make right judgments. 
The more you know of a given subject, the more you can get 
from a lecture or from reading on that subject. 
To be clear and to be accurate are the most important things 
in all study and in solving any of the problems of life. 
Remember that thoroughness pays in the long run. Being 
thorough means fulfilling the requirements of the situation in 
which you are placed. One can be wisely thorough without 
being exhaustively thorough. Know what to do and where 
to stop. 
Be true to the facts with which you are dealing. That is, 
don’t think that the book says what you expect it to say. Find 
out exactly just what it does say.
-P-A-G-E-217
  DIRECTING OF LEARNING AND STUDY 217 
Know exactly the aim of every study you go into. Adapt 
your method to that aim. Do exactly what you set out to 
do or know why you do something else and that it is right 
to change. 
The trial and error method may sometimes save time; 
but thinking will save you more time and a great deal of waste 
effort. 
Imitate, and imitate only the best; add some thinking even 
then. 
Mastery of material requires organization; if material is 
not well organized, organize it for yourself both for memory 
and for understanding. 
Give good attention to the things you want to understand 
and remember. 
Find the general subject or problem first; then find the first 
main thought, then the sub-topics under this main thought 
with the illustrations for each point; then the next main thought, 
the sub-topics and illustrations; repeat this until you have 
mastered your material. 
Find a concrete example for everything you want to under- 
stand and remember. 
Outline what you want to remember; then memorize the 
outline. 
Follow through good reasoning of others; read books in which 
you find good reasoning. 
Reason with others, and try to make your points so clear 
and forcible that the other man cannot fail to see them. 
Reason out theories, and then test them to see where they 
are good and where bad. 
Practise in picking out essential factors in situations. Learn 
how to pick out the most important ideas. 
Learn to detect errors in reasoning and to avoid them. 
Modes of Thought.—Discover the habits of thought that you 
have and that tend to lead you astray. 
Get all the facts you need before making a judgment. 
Do not be prejudiced by what you want to think or to believe. 
Be prejudiced only, to know clearly and accurately. 
Know whether things happen by coincidence or by cause 
and effect. 
Be definite in the use of words, and know exactly what others 
mean, either when they speak, or write.
-P-A-G-E-218
  218 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
Remember that reasoning by analogy, that is by similarities, 
never proves anything and is one of the commonest ways in 
which people are led astray in their thinking. 
A person has to understand in terms of his own knowledge. 
But reading your thoughts and feelings into things may lead 
you far from the truth. 
Be sure that an argument proves what it is supposed to prove 
and not something else. 
Distinguish an appeal to the feelings from an appeal to the 
intellect. 
Remember that a conclusion may be right even though the 
arguments are bad and fail to prove the conclusion. 
Above everything else, be clear and be accurate. 
Progress and Improvability.—Given the capacity, anyone, with 
proper methods, regular and persistent practice, can surpass 
the achievements of most people. 
The best improvement is found to occur where one practices 
very definitely the thing in which the improvement is desired. 
Do not practise one thing and expect much or perhaps any 
improvement in other things. 
Master all habits as you go along. 
However, in thought material, go ahead often when you do 
not fully understand; you will get new light; reviewing the 
whole matter later will help you further in a full understanding. 
Frequent reviews will give you the best results for the time 
you spend. Learn in the right order or in a very good order; 
use the best methods, and be regular in your application. 
Understand the causes of “plateaus” in your case, and apply 
the remedy needed. 
Don’t get the idea of studying just because a lesson is assigned. 
You are studying for your own advancement. Statistics show 
that it is possible for an educated person to rise higher and to do 
things impossible for an uneducated person. 
Learn to help yourself just as much as possible. 
Get your teacher to help you learn how to learn. 
Learn to study and to do everything as nearly as possible in 
the way you will do them after you leave school. 
Be a master of something. 
Transfer of Training.—Training in one thing may help in 
other things; it may also hinder in other things. If you learn 
to do a thing correctly the methods may help you to do other
-P-A-G-E-219
  DIRECTING OF LEARNING AND STUDY 219 
things. If you learn a thing incorrectly, it is likely to hinder 
your doing it correctly later. 
You improve most in the definite thing you study and practice. 
But if you try to apply, or if you have the ideal of the thing you 
are attempting, it may “carry over” to the doing of other things. 
Try to see the value of things you are learning and make 
them help you in other things wherever possible. 
Your methods of doing things transfer very often to doing 
other things. It is most important, therefore, how you do things. 
Thorough intensive study may broaden one in a way he does 
not expect. 
Memory and the Permanence of Acquisition.—There is no 
general memory; there are many memories. 
To remember better, have better conditions of study and 
have better methods of study. 
Use all the things that make for better attention, attitude 
and purpose. Have the intention to remember. 
Have many associations with the things you wish to remember. 
Use your knowledge. 
Take advantage of frequency of repetition, duration of the 
experience, vividness, recency, primacy, age and regularity. 
Learn at your own best rate. Go over material more slowly 
at first, then at a faster rate. It is doubtful as to whether you 
should try to study very fast. It is valuable to be able to study 
and learn quickly, but speed often means inaccuracy. The 
more valuable thing is to be accurate. 
Study the material at different times. 
Study by wholes and not by parts. Learn what is the best 
amount of material to be studied as a whole. 
Organize your material wherever you can and get the logical 
connections. Warm up to your work, and have two or three 
minutes at the end of the study for a hardening period. Do 
not allow any distractions at this time. 
Avoid fatigue, and have the best physical conditions possible. 
Do not depend upon mnemonics and mnemonic devices 
except where it is positively necessary. 
Learn very thoroughly if you want to remember for a long time. 
The mind is not to be stuffed. You should learn, assimilate 
and use. 
The Feelings and Interest.—One may become so absorbed in 
his work that there is no feeling connected with it, but interest  
-P-A-G-E-220
  
  220 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
is generally present in the best intellectual work. Other feelings 
are also desirable. 
To help arouse the desirable feelings and attitude for study: 
Choose the environment, people, situations, etc., which sug- 
gest the desired attitudes. Listen to, or better, participate in, 
discussions of the subject you are studying. 
Recall facts, people, accomplishments of others and of your- 
self that arouse you to the desired attitude. 
Compare your achievement with that of others and of your 
own earlier work. 
Have a motive for your study. 
Be wisely indignant over your failures, and direct the energy 
aroused to the study in hand. One may appeal to various 
instincts, the fighting instinct, for example, to develop the 
right aggressive attitude towards study. Decide that you have 
enough fight in you to conquer the difficulties in your lessons. 
Act as if you had the desired feelings and they may come. 
To arouse and develop interest: 
Use suggestion of environment; choose places and people that 
make you want to do your work; that arouse your enthusiasm. 
Attach or associate something pleasant with your subject. 
Get as pleasant an introduction to it as possible; get as much 
pleasant knowledge about it as you can. 
Take an attitude towards the subject; do something about it. 
Find a use you can make of the knowledge or accomplish- 
ment; this may be to solve problems, to converse on this topic 
with educated people; to earn a living, to have a finer appre- 
ciation of something, or what not. 
Find definite, concrete examples of the thoughts with which 
you are dealing. 
Purpose and determination make for better results in every 
way. 
Attention and Sustained Effort—The better the attention, 
the better all intellectual work. ye 
A student should practice giving the best attention he can in 
all situations. He should develop the habit of concentration 
for any situation. 
Some emotions help, for example, curiosity, interest, desire 
to achieve, and the like. Others hinder, for example, excite- 
ment, fluster and worry. 
Changing from one phase of a topic to another helps.
-P-A-G-E-221
  DIRECTING OF LEARNING AND STUDY 221 
Having many thoughts on a topic and following them out to 
their logical conclusions will aid. 
Competition with others and with one’s own past record is 
likely to make for sustained attention. 
Have a purpose, determination; care enough. If you care 
enough about a thing you are likely to succeed. Of course, 
you must have enough capacity to start with. 
The suggestions of environment may help; the books, rooms, 
people, etc., which give the right influence. 
Avoid the wrong suggestions: the easy chairs, the comfort- 
able easy going people, luxurious and distracting surroundings. 
To become relatively independent of distractions, try to 
study in any and all kinds of places, that is, where there is 
little and where there is much distraction. Persist, care enough 
about doing it, and hold to your purpose. This is the best 
‘way to form the habit of concentration. There is an easier way 
but it is not so good. That is to study at a certain time and in a 
certain place. This will form time and place habits. They 
will make it easy for you to study at the chosen time and in the 
chosen place. The reason that this is not so good is that it may 
make it difficult for you to study at other times and in other places. 
To know definitely what you are looking for will help you 
to find it. If you have a very clear idea of what you expect to 
see you may think you see it when it is not there. So you must 
be. careful. You may also overlook other important things. 
Do not mistake the feeling of fatigue for actual fatigue; and 
do not fall into the habit of feeling tired and having to stop 
study in a very short time. That is just a bad habit. 
Know clearly and exactly what you are to do; know clearly 
and exactly how to do it. 
Have an ideal and live up to it. Many of our great men 
have become great because they had an ideal and lived up to 
that ideal. ; 
Bodily Conditions.—The best bodily conditions are the 
necessary conditions for the best study. 
Remove physical difficulties wherever possible. 
Improve your mental work by improving your health. 
Plenty of good, well-prepared food, good digestion and assimi- 
lation, good light, fresh air, right temperature, proper humidity, 
and enough sleep are essentials to efficiency of both mind and 
body.
-P-A-G-E-222
  222 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
Right physical conditions not only permit more and better 
work, but enable you to do it with comfort and enjoyment. 
Artificial stimulants to work leave one in an abnormal 
condition. 
Normal incentives call forth the best energy, and leave one 
better off for one’s efforts. 
Suggestions to be emphasized for all study: 
Know exactly what you are to do. 
Study with a definite purpose. 
Adapt your method to the problem and to your type of mind. 
Solve your problem; think it through to the finish. 
What you know, know thoroughly. 
Organize your knowledge. 
Be clear and be accurate in all mental work. 
Be wisely thorough; be selective rather than exhaustive. 
Make the best use of time; divide your time well; learn at 
your own best speed. 
Get the best physical conditions for study. 
Choose the suggestive influences that will help you. Elim- 
inate distractions. 
Do not be disturbed by what you cannot do. Think about 
what you are doing and not about your feelings. 
Forget yourself in your problem. 
BE A MASTER OF SOMETHING. 
The Teacher’s Responsibility——The teacher’s responsibility 
includes knowing how to direct study, giving the necessary 
instructions and seeing that they are carried out, that they 
become habits of study, and seeing that physical conditions 
for study are what they should be. 
Directing study requires practice. No one can properly direct 
study without knowing just how to do it. There is not only 
the danger of giving insufficient or inadequate help; there is 
also the danger of giving too much help. A safe maxim would 
be: help the student to help himself. 
The best way to see that pupils carry out instructions for 
study is undoubtedly in having stated study periods which are 
carefully supervised. This makes it possible to give instruc- 
tions, to see that they are carried out, and children report that 
they are helped by a schedule which includes supervised study 
hours because it helps them to spend their time to better advan- 
tage. Several advantages are apparent; it keeps children from
-P-A-G-E-223
  DIRECTING OF LEARNING AND STUDY 223 
the problem of what to do next; of wasting time getting started; 
of giving too much time to favorite subjects, and too little to 
other subjects; and of getting into the habit of putting things 
off till some other time. Many methods have been tried and a 
period devoted, half to recitation and half to study, has been 
very successful. 
The supervision should include the seeing that chairs are of 
the right height for the pupils, that the desk is at the right angle; 
things that are not to be used should be put away so as not to 
be continually disturbing the work and the attention; and the like. 
Pupil’s Study Card and Schedule.—Some such card as that 
suggested by Reavis and modified by Parker will be found to 
be very useful. The following is taken from Parker’s Methods

Going into Details with the Student.—The suggestions given 
in this chapter for use with students are of a general nature 
and the teacher of each subject will find the necessity of making 
use of these general principles and of going farther with the 
individual student according to his particular needs and according 
to the particular needs of the special subject. 
The one great problem for each student is to discover the 
particular combination of methods which is best for him. 
The student who knows the laws of mind should also know 
what factors in the working of these laws are most important 
in his particular case. The following suggestions indicate 
some features of the individual problem. 
The teacher, for example, will try to get the pupil to have a 
purpose in his work. But for each student there is the problem: 
What purpose will you have for your work? To learn this sub- 
ject to help you in a certain profession; to study this subject or 
to read this book to answer certain questions; to study one subject 
thoroughly in order to be an authority on that subject; to study 
history in order to understand the great institutions of modern 
life; to study psychology in order to know the mind and to 
understand many of the facts of every day experience; to see a 
play in order to tell a friend about it, or, what will be your 
purpose? 
Organization is invaluable but how will you organize your 
knowledge so that it will best serve your purpose? Will you 
arrange all the facts topically with main heads and subheads, 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  
  DIRECTING OF LEARNING AND STUDY 225 
or, if you are studying history, will you place the facts in chrono- 
logical order, and make a table with dates at the left and the 
facts for each date at the right? Or, if it be science, will you 
arrange the facts under chapter headings, so to speak, and put 
all facts in their appropriate places under each chapter head? 
Will you use large pages and keep them in some logical order, or 
use index cards, and file them alphabetically? 
Some students can study for long periods at a time, others 
find shorter periods more beneficial. How long can you study 
at a time and get good results? How long for this subject, and 
how long for that? Again what is the best time of day for you to 
do your studying, and at what time can you do your hardest 
work? 
Rate and Method of Study.—The student must learn his own 
best rate of study. The best speed for one individual is not 
the best speed for others. Most of us probably study too lazily 
or else we leave the task until the last minute and then rush 
through it too fast. The best rate of learning can be determined 
only after many trials. This can generally be done by increasing 
the rate of learning until the student finds that he is failing in 
clearness of thought and accuracy of detail, and in the ability 
to recall what he has studied. What is the best rate for you? 
What is the best rate in this subject and what in that? How fast 
should you go at first and how fast at later stages of progress? 
It has long been supposed that the ear minded individual 
should be taught through the ear; and the eye minded child 
through the eye, etc. The truth seems to be that no matter 
how an individual is taught, he transforms what he learns into 
his own kind of memory. A person who is eye minded, may 
learn just as well by hearing, but he is likely to transform the 
sounds of the words into visual images and to remember them 
in that way. Most people, have not only one kind of predominant 
imagery with which they do most of their remembering; they 
are of mixed memory, so to speak, and use several types of 
images. There are exceptions to this, and there are exceptions 
to the fact that people can learn about as easily through 
one sense as through another. Younger people probably learn 
better through the ear and older through the eye. But this 
is not always so and is not necessarily so. 
Exceptions to the General Rules Need to Be Understood by 
Teachers.—A child is reported by Meumann, for example, who  
-P-A-G-E-226
  226 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
could not remember the outline of Greece until he had traced 
it. Here neither seeing nor hearing sufficed, but learning 
through the tactual and muscular senses was necessary. Indi- 
viduals can be found who do not remember well until they have 
articulated the matter to be learned. The first fact stands for 
most people, namely, that it does not matter so much through 
what sense a thing is learned, the earner transforms what he 
learns into his kind of imagery or memory. The second fact also 
stands, namely, that for some people. a certain kind of lear ning 
is necessary in order that they may remember. One kind of 
memory may be much better than any other kind. The problem 
for the student remains: In what way ea you study and get the 
best result? Should you see or hear or write out what you would 
remember or will any of those ways * ce in your case? Would 
it help to repeat audibly or semi-audibly? etc. : 
The size of units of study is to be determined. How grea 
an amount should you take to go through at one time? How 
many pages of poetry, or prose, or of history? 
Much failure in courses is because of insufficient prepara- 
tion for the work. The student may not know enough to under- 
stand the advanced work; he may lack concrete facts on which to

SUPERVISED STUDY AND THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM* 
Methods Outlined.—Various arrangements have been made 
in schools for the purpose of fitting in supervised study. This 
is not adding a new study. If so, there would be good reason 
to doubt the advisability of making the attempt. The change 
consists in introducing better methods of doing work that is 
already demanded. Its justification lies in the better results 
that have already been obtained. 
We may outline the methods that have been tried and those 
that may be worthy of trial under the varying conditions of 
different schools. Ina general way we may say that the methods 
involve: 
A. 1. The use of a regular teacher. 
2. The use of a special teacher. 
B. 1. Separate hours for instructions in study during school 
session. 
2. Special times appointed by the principal. 
3. The division of each regular school period. 
4. The double period. 
5. Conferences, during or after school, for individuals or 
groups of children. 
6. Extra time during the regular session, or in summer. 
7. The use of the general study hall. 
The Use of the Regular Teacher.—Where supervised study 
has been tried, the regular teacher has commonly been called 
upon to do the supervising. If he supervises his own pupils 
in his own subjects there is the advantage that he knows exactly 
what is needed and understands better than a special teacher 
the particular difficulties and individual differences of his par- 
ticular pupils. . This requires no addition to the teaching staff, 
* Material for this section is taken from what was Chapter 17 of the first 
edition, partly because the material omitted made some repetition of parts 
of the preceding chapter, and partly because the omitted part has been 
expanded into a 26 page pamphlet entitled, “How to Study.” This gives 
results of work with school and college students to determine suggestions 
that were adapted to different ages from the second grade through the 
university. Copies can be had from the author at 10 cents each.  
-P-A-G-E-228
228 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
but it does require that the teachers learn how to direct study. 
It would likely be found that emphasis on supervised study would 
be only an extension and methodical administration of that which 
is now done by most teachers in a poor and haphazard, and there- 
fore, in a much less effective way. ] 
The Use of a Special Teacher-—In many schools a special 
teacher who shall give his whole time to directing study has 
been found to be most beneficial. Such a teacher can be a 
specialist in the subject. Being a specialist, he can put more 
study, interest, and enthusiasm, into this work as the one great 
purpose of his teaching. This lane does not hold where 
the special teacher is a student of a Normal School doing this 
work to finish the requirements for a diploma. If the special 
teacher is obliged to coach in all subjects, it is obvious that he 
cannot be as well acquainted with each subject as the regular 
teachers. Neither is he as well acquail ted with the individual 
difficulties of each pupil. 
Both Methods Valuable.—Both methods have proved valu- 
able and it is perhaps too early to say which is the better. What 
is better for one school may not be better for another school. 
As in other matters of administration, the problem will need 
to be worked out for each school. This is true also in regard to 
the fitting of supervised study into the curriculum. 
Separate Times for Instruction in Study during the School 
Session.—One solution for the proble a of how to find time for 
supervised study is to take the time in place of other work, 
either, by taking a whole period for this in place of other work, or, 
by shortening several periods, and using the time thus gained. 
If the former method is used, aan hours may be used 
on succeeding days. On the first day, the first period can be 
given to supervised study throughout the school; on the second 
day, the second period can be used, and so on, until each class 
has been instructed in methods of studying each subject. This 
can then be repeated. 
The latter method is probably better for things that are not 
to be so regular as supervised study should be. This virtually 
means changing the schedule and rather than make a change 
like this permanent, some other more ett plan should 
be found. 
Special Times Appointed by the Principal_—Another method 
is that of having special periods set aside by the principal. 
     
-P-A-G-E-229
  DIRECTING OF LEARNING AND STUDY 229 
This can be done so as to sandwich in the supervised study 
where there seems to be a good chance, or as a special feature. 
But this, again, does not give the uniformity needed, and is 
likely to be only a very inadequate way of solving the problem. 
This is better than nothing and where doubt exists as to the value 
of supervised study, a few trials well managed might prove its 
worth and show the value of regular, methodical, supervision. 
The Division of Every Period, Part for Supervised Study.—A 
method which has found favor with many teachers is the division 
of each period, so that part is given to the work as ordinarily 
carried on, and part given to teaching the pupils how to study 
the next lesson. A division of half and half has been successful 
in some schools. The first part of the time is given to recitation 
and discussion, the second half of the hour is used for giving 
directions to students as to how they are to go to work. The 
pupils are made definitely conscious of the particular problems 
they have to solve. Here each teacher has the opportunity to 
apply all the knowledge he has regarding the application of princi- 
ples of study to his particular lesson. Making the assignment 
is a very definite part of this second half of the period. It is 
carefully prepared and made part of the teaching of the next 
lesson. Teaching the children how to work out this assignment 
follows. A little home study to finish lesson and for daily review 
is very desirable. 
There is much to be said for this method. It has proved so 
successful in some schools, that more than half of the period 
is given to teaching how to study. The chief preparation of 
the teacher for this kind of lesson is preparation in the methods 
of study, and, needless to say, this work is very different from the 
giving of lessons in the old way. Contrary to expectation, it is 
found that there is plenty for the teacher to do and say in teaching 
pupils how to study the next lesson. The teacher finds that this 
is the most valuable part of the period. This method can be 
started without a single change in the curriculum. 
The Double Period.—Some schools have what is called the 
double period. For example, forty minutes are given to the 
recitation as now commonly carried on; the next forty minutes 
are given to directing the study of the new lesson. This has 
proved successful in not a few schools. One outcome is that 
there is more school study and less home study. The school 
study appears to be superior to the home study, and the same
-P-A-G-E-230
    230 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF ee AND STUDY 
amount of time spent in directed study at school gives far better 
results than the home work. 
Study Conferences.—Individuals or groups of pupils, who 
need special help, may by special appointment, meet with the 
regular teacher at a time when he has a vacant period. Or, if 
there is a special teacher, these pupils may be assigned to cer- 
tain hours when they shall meet the special teacher and receive 
the needed help. Such conferences may be used for both back- 
ward pupils who need help to keep up with their classes, or for 
bright pupils, who with special help may skip a grade. This 
latter plan is a good way of solving the problem of dealing with 
supernormal children in schools where there is no adequate 
provision for them. It is possible by means of such conferences 
to work out many problems arising from the individual differ- 
ences of pupils in large classes. Pupils at the lower end of the 
class may be helped not only to keep up with their class but 
encouraged to stay in school and do their best. Particular 
defects and difficulties may be discovered, which might not 
otherwise become known. A little help at the right time may 
save the individual pupil much loss of time. The most economi- 
cal way to deal with repeaters is to prevent their ever becoming 
such. 
Extra Study Periods.—For cases in which the regular school 
periods do not seem adequate, extra time has been used with 
immensely valuable results. The simplest way is the taking 
of half an hour or so after the regular school session. Some 
schools have made use of Saturday morning for coaching backward 
pupils. A greater extension of this principle is found in special 
summer sessions for coaching not only backward pupils, but also 
supernormals. The backward pupils are helped so they can go 
on with their classes; the supernormals so that they can skip a 
grade. 
Directing Study in the General Study Hall.—lIf there is a gen- 
eral assembly hall in which students not in attendance at a 
class or laboratory meet to do their studying, there is an oppor- 
tunity to help them in their methods of study. The teacher 
in charge of such a room is likely to have too many other duties 
at this time. There are difficulties of many kinds arising in 
many subjects and the problem of discipline may interfere. 
At best, the use of this time for supervising study is but a make- 
shift and not systematic enough to give the best results. The     
-P-A-G-E-231
DIRECTING OF LEARNING AND STUDY 231 
teacher, unless he is a special coach, is not likely to be prepared 
to help pupils with all the difficulties that arise in the different 
subjects. In this limited time the teacher can give adequate 
help to only a few of all who are in need of it. 
Essential Factors in the Administration of Study Supervision. 
Among the most essential factors in the planning of supervised 
study in the school are the following: The supervised study should 
have a regular place in the curriculum. It should not be left 
to chance or occasional use, but requires just as much place as 
any other work of the school. Each child should receive his 
share of help; the plan should not merely permit, but should 
require a certain amount of supervision for each child in 
each subject. This will help to eliminate the pupil’s practice 
of having trouble for the purpose of getting special attention. 
The teacher, if not a special coach, should supervise his own 
subject, and should know the particular difficulties of the chil- 
dren and the inherent obstacles in the lessons. Attention should 
be given to the right methods, not to that which should not be 
done, except where necessary to break up an old bad habit. 
Correct methods should be made fully conscious to the pupil at 
first and then made completely formed habits. Informal, 
personal, encouraging help gives the best results. Marks should 
be given for methods of study as well as for the results of study. 
’ And, it should be remembered, just because time has been given 
to teach the pupil how to study, it is not to be expected that he 
will know how, or even know that he has been instructed in the 
matter. He must be instructed, and made explicitly conscious 
of method, and then tested in his knowledge of how to study.

  PART 4: CONCLUSION 
CHAPTER 19 
DEFINITENESS IN AIM AND IN METHOD 
The Need of Definiteness.—‘“‘It is true,” writes Professor 
Snedden, “that the largest single problem to be solved on behalf 
of the high school of today is that of a clearer definition of the 
valid aims of secondary education.” ° 
“The most impressive fact,” writes Professor Judd, “which 
stands out in examining the results of a series of tests is the 
need in schools of more definite standards of work. Teachers 
are working in ignorance of what they ought to accomplish.” 
It is clear from a psychological point of view that if teachers 
are going to secure definite results, they must know what results 
they are to obtain. One may do traditional things and cover 
the traditional number of pages of a text book. But it is another 
matter to know definitely just what is to be accomplished and to 
be able to accomplish it. The psychologist hopes to be able to 
accomplish it. The psychologist hopes to be able to help the 
teacher obtain desired results by helping to improve method. 
We have already shown that the habit theory is true to the 
multitude of facts that appear in connection with the educa- 
tive process in the individual. It has, as has also been said, 
the advantage of definiteness. Warning must again be given 
against attempting to interpret anything so broad as education 
under too narrow a theory. But it must also be emphasized 
that this is not a narrow theory. For habit as we have defined 
it includes habitudes, interests, attitudes, all, indeed, that may 
be considered more or less permanent tendencies as the result of 
learning. It is at least worthy of consideration that we take 
habit in this sense as the great fundamental basis of educational 
practice and for the accomplishment of the great ends of educa- 
tion which may then be formulated in more general terms such 
as social efficiency and character. Again let us remember that 
habits are not so unmodifiable and that plasticity is not so easily 
lost as has been commonly thought. And further that progress 
is learning of any kind shows just this making and modification 
233

234 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
  of habit. It is fitting that we look at this most important 
matter of definiteness a little closer and consider a few of the 
problems of the school in this connection. 
Social Values.—The vagueness of aim and the varieties of 
aim are not denied. In fact they are admitted and emphasized 
from all sides. The psychologist can only add to the demand for 
greater cooperation for deciding what the legitimate aims should 
be. These, no doubt, must be decided in terms of social value. 
The examination of values of the various subjects to which the 
curriculum is being subjected today is inevitable and of great 
promise. No one more than the psychologist realizes the need 
for definiteness of aim. For it is only as he knows what is to be 
accomplished that he can render the service of working out the 
most efficient methods for obtaining those results. 
The Binding Force of Tradition.—Students of education have 
been joined by the disappointed and questioning parents in 
considering the problem as to why certain subjects are taught 
in the schools. The answer has been in many respects that 
things are not of the value that had been supposed. And the 
reorganization of text books shows the elimination of many 
parts of subjects hitherto supposed to be necessary. Whole 
subjects have been dropped, for example, Greek, and Latin 
is perhaps the storm center of discussion at the present time. 
Latin and English afford typical illustration of certain facts 
and principles. 
The Case of Latin.—It is interesting to trace the shifting 
defense of Latin in the schools. Latin has been considered essen- 
tial to a liberal education. When Latin was introduced it was 
the road to a liberal education. It was necessary for one to know 
Latin in order to obtain a liberal education, if not any kind of an 
education, because the things that were to be learned were written 
only in Latin. This reason for learning Latin no longer exists, 
nor has it existed for a good many years. The case is clear. 
The conditions which demanded the study of Latin ceased to 
exist. The binding force of tradition has continued. 
Latin and the Professions.—The foundations of the old argu- 
ment having been carried away, the defense shifted. Latin 
was useful in the professions of law, theology, philology, his- 
tory, etc. Any language may be useful to the historian or the 
philologist, but we are not all sufficiently interested in either 
of these subjects to make Latin necessary and few would ever 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
  
DEFINITENESS IN AIM AND METHOD 235 
make it useful to any appreciable extent. As for law, we have 
been told many times that the Latin used in law is not the 
classical Latin and that the classical student is obliged to learn the 
law Latin when he comes to it. As a jurist puts it, the Latin 
used in law is so different that even persons of good classical 
education cannot understand it. The theologian is quite likely 
to study Greek, or Greek and Hebrew, in preference to Latin. 
Roman Literature.—Again the defense shifted. One should 
study Latin in order to gain a knowledge of the rich treasures 
of Roman literature. In this also one may find recreation 
and pleasure after the day’s toil. But it has been discovered 
that it takes many years of study of Latin to have the treasures 
of Roman literature opened up by that means. One must 
spend seven to ten years in the study in order to have any 
very great facility with the language. Those who maintain 
that this is too great a price to pay, especially inasmuch as 
this material can be had for the most part in English, have 
not been satisfactorily answered. Much may be lost in trans- 
lations, and by the same token, much more is likely to be lost 
by the poor translations of most students. It is yet to be 
proved that a student can not get more by using a good trans- 
lation than by making his own translations, to say nothing of 
the vast amount of difference in the expenditure of time. The 
argument for Latin as a recreation is negligible. 
Latin for Mental Training.—But another defense is added. 
Study Latin to train the mind. But psychologists are thor- 
oughly persuaded that there is no such general transfer of 
training as was earlier thought and there is probably a small 
amount of improvement in one subject because of improve- 
ment in another; just what general improvement there is must 
be shown, but not by comparing classical students who have 
studied Latin four to seven or more years with scientific students 
who have studied one science one or two years. And also not 
by comparing the best taught subject in the curriculum, as Latin 
is known to be, with results of poorer teaching in other subjects. 
But, at least, study Latin to improve your English. This 
sounds plausible as we know that English comes largely from 
the Latin. But competent observers tell us that in many cases, 
at least, it is very questionable whether or not the study of 
Latin contributes results of very much value to English. Indeed 
we are told that the majority of Latin students may be found to
-P-A-G-E-236
  
  | 236 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
have their English actually impaired by the use of poor English 
‘in the making of translations. 
Our conclusion is that the value of Latin under the present 
day conditions needs to be most seriously studied before we 
content ourselves with going on spending several millions of 
dollars a year in the teaching of Latin and requiring several 
years of our children’s time in studying the subject. In con- 
sidering the psychological fact that most improvement is in 
the thing practiced, it is very pertinent to ask after all, is not 
the study and practice of English the best way to improve in 
English? Perhaps we shall think some day that it was curious 
we should ever have to ask that question. 
The Question of English.—The study of English as a tool, 
and it has other objects, is of fundamental importance. No 
other subject is allowed so much time in the school and no 
other subject, as we are told, shows such poor returns for the 
time and energy spent. What help can the psychologist give 
in connection with this problem? 
One fact stands out with surprising clearness. That is that 
whereas the student may have practice with good English so 
far as his work for the English department goes, he is likely 
to practise poor English in his work for other departments. 
There is a very interesting and suggestive study of the transfer 
of spelling from English to Sociology themes that is pertinent. 
Professor A. R. Mead reports the following experiment. 
With the help of four graduate students he collected thirty 
themes each from as many students who had written both in 
English and in Sociology. Each man’s theme in English was 
compared with his theme in Sociology as regards the accuracy 
of spelling. The writer tells us: 
“The problem accurately stated was, ‘To what extent do 
students use the accurate spelling vocabulary of their themes 
in English in themes in sociology?’ ”” The results of the com- 
parison of papers as made by the four graduate students :are 
stated as follows: “‘There -were then, approximately 160 .per 
cent. more misspelled -words in the sociology themes than in 
the English themes. In other words, there was a very general 
tendency to lower the standard of efficiency in spelling used 
in the sociology themes. In matters of punctuation and cap- 
italization a beginning of a study wasmade. Here, too,.a similar 
tendency was observed.
-P-A-G-E-237
  DEFINITENESS IN AIM AND METHOD 237 
“The writer believes that this minor study shows a very 
prevalent tendency in the effectiveness of the teaching of Eng- 
lish in high schools and colleges, although the investigation 
made concerned college students only. As he interprets the 
situation, it represents a failure to secure habits which trans- 
fer, or ideals which are consciously generalized. As such, it 
suggests the following: (1) teachers of English should strive to 
secure such transfer; (2) there should be a very much greater 
cooperation in the teaching of English. Had the instructor in 
sociology placed emphasis upon correct spelling, why should the 
students not have had a stronger tendency to spell correctly? (3) 
if such conditions exist as to spelling, the very content of one 
phase of the English language, what must be the conditions 
regarding the transfer of the more intangible elements of the 
mother tongue. It is probably easier to secure transfer of content 
than of some other elements. Hence, it is probable that many 
of the values of English are being realized only in a very minor 
degree,’’®° 
To state it differently, the student practices poor English 
more than he practices good English and has in his nervous 
system the results of his practice. It may seem a little hard on 
the school and college to say that they are fostering, nay more, 
that they are practically teaching poor English. Where other 
departments do not cooperate with the English teachers is 
in the demand for good English the influence of that school or 
college is predominantly for poor English. This is the bare fact. 
And the English department alone with twice the time at its 
disposal then it now has could hardly be expected to counteract 
the tendencies that are allied against it. 
A Lesson from the French Schools.—The point,—that people 
learn to do as they practice,—is taken seriously in the French 
schools and we may well take a lesson from them in this respect. 
A quotation from the valuable study of Professor R. W. Brown 
will serve to emphasize further what I have been maintaining. 
Professor Brown tells us that ‘‘The value of the training the 
French boy receives in his courses in composition is increased 
materially by the character of the writing he is required to do in 
other subjects. It would be exaggeration, assuredly, to say that 
his writing in these other subjects is always done just as carefully 
as that which he submits to his teacher of composition; and it 
would be just as great an overstatement to say that every teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  238 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
of mathematics, botany, and history is as much interested in the 
character of his pupils’ writing as he is in the subject he teaches. 
Nevertheless, the quality of this writing which is done as a part 
of the work in other classes receives a degree of attention from 
both pupil and teacher that in America may be found only in 
unusual instances. 
“Teachers in France would protest against the assertion that 
they had attained an ideal condition in this respect; many of 
them feel, as we feel in America, that other departments too 
often neglect the quality of pupils’ language. Yet when one 
compares the practices of the two countries, one cannot refrain 
from felicitating the teacher of the mother tongue in France upon 
the more conscientious, more intelligent support he receives from 
his colleagues in other fields of study. The result is not difficult 
to see. When the boy is obliged to write in his other courses, 
he sooner or later reaches the conclusion that all writing is impor- 
tant. He therefore not only gains from the thoughtful practice 
which he carries on in history, civics, and physics or botany, but 
he derives new profit from his instruction in composition. His 
teacher of the mother tongue ceases to be a person who is paid 
to talk about something that is unimportant except to himself, 
and becomes a person of consequence who can help one in doing 
what everybody seems to think is worth doing well. 
. . . “I was especially impressed by the neatness and accu- 
racy with which the students in the normal school classes did all 
of their writing. I noticed, moreover, that many of the correc- 
tions on advanced papers had to do with the organization of 
the material and with smaller questions of clearness . . . In 
fact, whatever the prevailing faults of expression, there seemed 
to be no assurance for the pupil that the teacher would, by 
passing over them habitually, permit himself to undo the work 
of the teacher of composition and literature. 
“The critical attitude toward all the pupils’ written work is 
maintained also toward his speech. This fact was brought to 
my notice in a striking manner the first time I visited a class 
in science . . . If I had encountered no other cases, I might 
have thought this only the whim of an extremely sensitive 
teacher. But as I visited other classes in a variety of subjects, 
I came to see that most French teachers have a well developed 
conscience in respect to such matters. They do not drive a 
boy to abandon spontaneous speech, but they do insist that he

make elear cut, straightforward answers, and that they be 
phrased in reasonably acceptable language.’’!* 
Other Facts in Relation to English.—Some of the difficulty in 
the teaching and learning of English may be seen also when 
one realizes the variety of problems which arise in dealing 
with the subject. The teacher desires to train the student in 
English composition, but attention to rhetoric is distracted by 
corrections of, and instruction in, grammar. The teacher wishes 
the student to acquire some appreciation of the great literary 
masterpieces, but enjoyment of the literary productions must, 
seemingly, be interrupted by minute and generally uninteresting 
dissection of the English itself. At least two vastly different 
kinds of work appear to be thrown in unpsychological manner 
under one head: namely, the study of formal English and the 
study of English literature. These different kinds of work 
require different methods. The psychologist must advise; 
have some specific aim for one kind of work, and determine and 
use the particular methods calculated to attain this aim; for 
another kind of work choose and make use of the particular 
methods required for that. 
Conditions of Improvement in English.—We are now ready 
to indicate some conclusions which may be drawn and to apply 
some of the facts and laws indicated in earlier chapters of this 
book. In the first place, most improvement is specific, that is to 
say, most improvement is in the thing practiced. If, then, one is 
to improve in English, why not study English with this definite 
purpose? How much can one improve in English by studying 
another language? Is the price worth paying? In the opinion 
of the present writer these problems are still unsolved and need 
to be studied seriously. In the next place, and akin to the first 
point, it has been discovered in the laboratory that much of the 
greater improvement in laboratory experiments over the improve- 
ment outside of the laboratory is because of the specific nature 
of the practice on certain definite things. If, then, the student is 
to improve in English, why should not certain specific improve- 
ment be chosen and that improvement be worked for by the defi- 
nite methods best calculated to bring the desired results? Again, 
it is known that improvement is greater where the learner knows 
his successes and failures. Is it not, therefore, advisable that the 
specific aim of any work be conscious to the student and that he 
know just what progress he is making towards the specified end? 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  240 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
The Theory of Specific Training versus Formal Discipline.— 
One other conclusion must be at least considered. If most 
improvement is in the thing practiced, if formal discipline or 
transfer of training is relatively small in amount, and, per- 
haps, limited in nature, should not the curriculum be made up 
on the theory of specific training instead of on the traditional 
theory of formal discipline? Think also of the vast amount of 
time spent, the large expenditures of money and the altogether 
questionable value of results, involved in following the disci- 
plinary conception. 
A Quotation from Professor Snedden.—The solution is stated 
in no uncertain terms by Professor Snedden, who says: ‘‘In 
teaching modern languages we must wholly discard the doctrine 
of formal discipline. As found in current defenses of modern 
language teaching, it is an unfortunate heritage from the facti- 
tious pedagogy of Latin. In view of current knowledge and 
uncertainties regarding mental training, the one safe assumption 
is this, ‘Teach only those things, and to those degrees, and by 
those methods, that serve a demonstrably useful purpose in indi- 
vidual economy—useful, that is, as producing, in specific and 
tangible ways, the culture, the refinements, the sensibilities, the 
stored knowledges, the moral habits, the ethical ideals, the voca- 
tional powers that the world in its best judgment wants and 
approves. So teach towards the realization of these objects that 
the appropriate exercise of mental qualities is always involved, 
and the results of which will persist.’ We know little today in 
favor of any theory of pure mental gymnastics. What experi- 
ence everywhere teaches us, if we would but see it, is that valu- 
able, and probably always the most valuable, mental training 
invariably accompanies the vigorous and systematic pursuit of 
intellectual objects in themselves worth while. The cumulative 
massing of the results of this by-product training in numerous 
and varied fields is what gives us, on the whole, the best mental 
training of which we have any knowledge.’’*! 
A Quotation from Professor Thorndike.—“‘ An impartial inven- 
tory of the facts in the ordinary pupil of ten to eighteen would 
find the general training from English composition greater than 
that from formal logic, the training from physics and chemistry 
greater than that from geometry, and the training from a year’s 
study of the laws and institutions of the Romans greater than that 
from equal study of their language. The grammatical studies. 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  DEFINITENESS IN AIM AND METHOD 241 
which have been considered the chief depositories of disciplinary 
magic would be found in general inferior to scientific treatments of 
human nature as a whole. The superiority for discipline of 
pure over applied science would be referred in large measure to 
the fact that pure science could be so widely applied. The 
disciplinary value of geometry would appear to be due, not to 
the simplicity of its conditions, but to the rigor of it proofs; 
the greatest disciplinary value of Latin would appear in the case, 
not of those who disliked it and found it hard, but of those to 
whom it was a charming game.’’"41 
The Practical Conclusion.—What shall we say in the face of 
the facts known at the present time except that the only wise 
course is to accept the theory of specific instead of the theory 
of general improvement as the basis of our course of study? 
There is nothing then to prevent us from trying to get all the 
disciplinary value possible from what is taught. Shall we then 
teach more science instead of so much Latin? The objection 
rises immediately that science is not so well taught. This is 
undoubtedly true. But the course for educators is plain. Not 
to continue that which happens to be well taught now but to see 
that other subjects are as well taught. 
Above all we must get away from the old incorrect notion 
that the mind is a collection of faculties whose “general training” 
is possible. We must try to do that which is psychologically 
possible, practical and most valuable, not that which which is 
dictated by the prejudice of tradition. The verdict of psychology 
is that we need to have a clear statement of aims, so that we may 
adapt definite methods for their accomplishment, and that the 
improvement above everything else, is, for the most part, in the 
thing practiced, and as the influence “carried over” into another 
field, it is little and may be either to improve or to impair. 
The aim of the business man, of the scientist, of the manufac- 
turer, is for definite results. The student and the educator must 
learn the lesson. 
QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY 
1. Discuss the need for definiteness of aim in the work of the teacher. 
2. Carefully define the aims for two or three subjects with which you are 
most familiar. 
3. How must the binding force of tradition be wisely counter-balanced by 
consideration of social values?  
-P-A-G-E-242
    242 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING AND STUDY 
4, What is the difference in the value of Latin as a school subject at the 
present time and at the time when it was put into the curriculum? 
5. Just what attitude should we take towards the teaching of a subject like 
Latin in the schools? Should we argue for or against it, or try to find 
exactly its social value, or try to compare it in social value with other 
subjects? 
6. How may the influence of the schools and colleges actually be for poor 
English rather than for good English? Show in terms of the principle 
of habit formation. 
7. How far can the principle of habit help us to the much needed definiteness 
in educational practice? 
Discuss the possibility of making the aims and results of education com- 
parable in definiteness with those of other kinds of business. Ke

STATEMENT OF NEEDS 
WE need to organize knowledge into complete wholes or 
projects, looking toward well-conceived, purposive ends. 
We need to discriminate in teaching between bare facts 
and constructive projects, around which facts are gathered 
and centered. 
We need to economize time and avoid waste by organiz- 
ing instruction. 
We need to avoid what is vague and merely abstract. 
We need a better basis, in large instructional units, 
for planning lessons and for executing class-teaching. 
We need to consider knowledge not as formal and static 
but as progressive and dynamic, 7.e., as contributing to 
the growth of ideas. 
We need to start out in every new subject with full, keen, 
relishable knowledge and, on this basis, to provide for 
steady growth and organization into large units. 
We need to practice the use of knowledge at every turn, 
first by directing attention to what is serviceable and, 
secondly, by using it in the realization of projects. 
We need to put a far richer meaning into common, famil- 
iar topics which are types for later growth and expansion. 
We need to simplify, organize, and enrich every impor- 
tant topic or project until it reaches the stage of a complete 
achievement.

   TEACHING BY PROJECTS 
CHAPTER I 
PROJECTS IN THE SCHOOL 
PROJECTS are of two kinds: 
First, the child’s project undertaken at his own behest 
when he is pressed by a felt desire or need, ¢.g. two classes 
the bird house, the rabbit trap, a homemade ° Proiects 
telephone. 
Secondly, the projects of others which the child appro- 
priates, into which he is easily drawn, and to which he gives 
his undivided attention, as the invention of the cotton gin, 
the planning of a canal lock, or improving the harbor of 
San Francisco; or he is absorbed in Crusoe’s projects of 
cave-making, boat-building, and taming of animals. 
There is a wide range to the first kind of self-chosen proj- 
ects that a child falls upon, from doll dresses, sleds, tree- 
houses, or camping trips, to the dramatizing of a tale and even 
the writing of a story or poem. There is a still wider scope 
and bigness to the projects of the second class that he 
appropriates from without, and both sorts happily open the 
way into important school studies. Even a child’s games 
show how easily he passes beyond his own small projects 
to those of his elders, as in hunting, gardening, and house 
building. He participates freely in the projects of men 
exploring new regions, as Boone and Frémont; or Fulton 
building and exhibiting the first steamboat; or Captain 
B I

  2 TEACHING BY PROJECTS 
Eads constructing the jetties to open a deep passage at 
the mouth of the Mississippi. These projects which men 
and women, active in the world, are pushing to completion, 
are appropriate ~and engaging subjects for young people 
who are just opening their eyes to the big things in life, 
as, Livingstone opening up Central Africa, the Red Cross 
busy in relief work, Cornell founding a university for 
the people, New York City constructing its huge aqueduct 
from the Catskills for supplying its vast population 
with water. Industrial and scientific projects in mining, 
in agriculture, and in sanitation are the choice enterprises 
for children. Even big government projects in irrigation 
and canal construction engage the mind i in genuine thought 
problems. 
In the impulse to adjust themselves to the larger world, 
children find themselves involved in these important 
_ projects whether developed in the past or now opening up 
in life about them. 
Educationally considered, we believe a child is at his 
best when planning and executing his own projects, or’at 
Value of least those which engage his full powers? Adult 
projects men and women also in active undertakings are 
at their best when working out effectively important busi- 
ness and other projects. Even society, in its larger organi- 
zations, is at its best when engaged energetically in develop- 
ing and executing social projects. In all these cases the 
‘project has the merit of a self-directed organization of 
mental and physical resources tq achieve a well-considered 
‘result. The larger projects of adult life and of social and 
industrial progress have the additional merit that they tax 
the serious thought powers of children. They are real 
| problems resting upon a practical basis of life experience. 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
  PROJECTS IN THE SCHOOL 3 
( They also stimulate and require a sustained effort in | 
thinking. Fi 
Whether the child is engaged in his self-chosen project 
or makes his own some bold and wifficult undertaking of 
another, the motive and energy of thought are much the 
same. The project itself is a natural summons to ambition 
and effort, an impulsive forward movement in purposeful 
thinking, and yet objective, and oftentimes even dramatic 
and spectacular. These project-problems, expressing the 
strain of thought and effort to master the forces of environ- 
ment, lead more directly into life conditions as they are 
than any other studies. . 
There is a close and necessary connection between the s 
self-chosen projects of the child’s small world and the — 
large projects of the life beyond. The smaller problems 
are a prelude to the major ones soon to follow, to which 
they are so closely akin in motive and in spirit. Children |   should be induced to work out as many of these self-chosen 
projects as may be feasible in order that they may take on 
the problem-solving attitude with respect to the larger, 
more complex problems whgse solution may be thought out. 
It is a truism of our educational creed that sensory 
impressions based on object lessons and motor response form 
the primary basis of thought in dealing with the later 
materials of knowledge. The project conceived and exe- 
cuted by the child on the ground of his own experience is a 
still better basis for our educational efforts because it | 
/ sets up in children self-determination and_purposeful 
activity in a complete, natural, and well-rounded unit of 
effort) This kind and quality of constructive thought can | 
be carried forward into later studies and into life as a funda- 
mental method of exploring, organizing, andusing knowledge.

  4 TEACHING BY PROJECTS 
The object of a good course of study is to allow the chil- 
dren to grow into and identify themselves with the enter- 
prising projects which men, past and present, have found 
most essential to their welfare and progress. The chyld’s 
own little projects are very essential beginnings. in this 
fundamental process of appropriating and using knowledge 
and experience directed by himself toward useful ends. 
The best devices of instruction may be turned into this 
channel where children are led to the self-appropriation of 
those larger projects in which wiser heads, active in the 
world, set their chief store. 
ait. While the larger projects of the world just outside of the 
Ei school have a powerful attraction for children, it is of equal 
Growth ° Unportance to repeat and emphasize the approach 
fromindi- to these projects out of the child’s experience so 
ae that the projects of his own making grow into the 
Projects = larger schemes of life. Contact with life at both 
ends is essential, first in africh child environment} and 
secondly in a lsechiee better-organized social environment 
beyond the school walls.) The world’s experience and 
wisdom are gathered up and organized into these successful 
projects. They express the growing stages, the actual. 
evolution of the main life processes in a practical world. 
In plying his trade among school children the teacher 
must be a full master of both kinds of experience, the in- 
dividual and the social, constantly playing back and forth 
between the two, establishing thus that steady continuity 
of growth into a larger experience which makes education 
all of one piece. 
On this basis it is necessary for the teacher to atid the 
big world and its dominating projects quite as closely as 
the child, his tendencies, and activities. This cannot be 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  PROJECTS IN THE SCHOOL 5 
called an easy program for the teacher. But it is at least 
an opportunity to sound the depths of our real problem of 
education and to turn our effort into the main current of 
progress in the teaching art. 
The term project belongs in one sense to the language of 
business, — or of plans and schemes in active life. It isan 
echo from a noisy world, an intrusion upon the ,, | jects re- 
quiet of the school, like a sharp train whistle or a fect real 
noisy street wagon. But our drowsy school ea 
work may need this influx of noise and disturbance from 
without. At any rate the school is being brought into sharp 
contact with real life. In the school program itself, the 
children are learning to understand and adjust themselves 
to life surroundings and to take in the full meaning of the 
schemes and forces that are shaping society outside of the 
school. | by 
In taking over these life projects and adopting them into 
a plan of instruction as units of thought and effort, we find 
in them two striking qualities that fit the needs of teaching. | 
e irst, they are objective and practical, not theoretical and 
vague. Big projects like the power plant at Muscle Shoals, | 
the Panama Canal, or the jetty improvements at the mouth | 
of the Mississippi stand out as commanding objects of 
attention. They are worth an examination./ Secondly, such | 
a real undertaking establishes a center of purposeful effort | 
which develops rapidly into a fruitful, progressive subject 
of study.) Around this definite, tangible center the ma- 
terials of knowledge begin to collect and organize and 
thought has plenty of stuff to work upon. 
The term project as we are using it has a wide scope and 
is applicable to a variety of undertakings in several im- 
portant studies. It may be worth while to particularize 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  \, > .aeer » 
Cm > , 
6 TT TEACHING. BY PROJECTS ~ 
in some detail the wide range of capital projects which the 
school may now find profitable as standard units of mental 
effort. 
\First : There are simple, objective projects of the hand-work 
type. We are familiar with them in the larger and smaller 
Shop ang Constructions of the shops, for example, in 
home proj- textile fabrics, in wood work, in book binding and 
a printing, in pottery, and in many related home 
undertakings such as repairs, reconstructions, and sanitary 
appliances. To the same group belong plans for school 
and home gardening, agriculture and fruit growing, chicken 
raising, dairying, and other specialties. The household 
arts supply another group of definite projects in laundering, 
sewing, cooking, and millinery, in house decoration and 
furnishing. In some schools there is a tendency to extend 
_ school credits to these home enterprises and accomplish- 
ments. These shop-and-farm and household projects have 
both a marked educational value, and a clear, practical 
utility. They require a distinct forethought in planning 
and designing, resourcefulness in meeting new and untried 
situations, persistent purpose and industry in executing 
plans, and, finally, a proper use of the results or products. 
Not many school exercises of the old stripe combine in one 
strong series of efforts all these merits and advantages. 
Secondly : The study of geography supplies a profusion of 
big, tangible projects of conspicuous importance in human 
Industrial affairs, as projects in bridge construction, in rail- 
and com- road engineering and mountain tunneling, in 
projects expensive mining operations, in the survey and 
building of canals, in dealing with extensive forest reserves, 
in planning city waterworks and reservoirs, in irrigation 
schemes on a large scale, in installing great water powers 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  PROJECTS IN THE SCHOOL 7 
at dams and falls in rivers, in laying ocean cables, in build- 
ing subways, in improving harbors, in regulating rivers 
by levees and jetties, in the drainage of swamp areas, in great 
corporations for the conduct of business on a vast scale, 
as steamship companies and railroad systems. We are 
now discovering that these large municipal, governmental, 
and industrial projects are in themselves complete and 
well-organized units of study, the best sort of standard 
topics for schoolroom instruction. The school can well 
turn its attention to these enterprises because they are so 
largely shaping life about us; they are dominant in their 
influence upon the occupations, the homes and surroundings 
of thousands and millions of our people. They are the 
things that children desire to know and understand. Ex- 
periments in the full school-treatment of these topics have 
also demonstrated that they have a peculiar suitability 
to the thinking power and interest of children. 
In another and quite different way nature herself works 
out on a large scale projects which we study in geography, 
as the sculpturing of a river valley, the work of a mountain 
glacier, the course and influence of an ocean current, the 
regular circulation of winds and moisture upon the earth, 
the course and movements of a cyclonic storm. These 
may be called natural units of study, displaying nature’s 
big patterns or designs, by which she works out her projects 
in making the earth a fit dwelling place for man. 
Thirdly: A third group of projects has a more distinctly 
scientific origin. Inventions and discoveries based upon 
scientific principles are embodied in steam Sint ik 
engines, wireless stations, power plants, great applied 
telescopes, electric motors, mining and smelting “°° 
processes, lightning rods, hydrostatic presses, steam dredges, 
 
-P-A-G-E-16

and water filters. Scientific processes also are applied to 
the ventilation of buildings, to hospital and surgery prac- 
tice, to the propagation of plants, the extraction and 
preservation of foods, to the fertilizing of soils, to the bac- 
terial treatment of diseases, to quarantine and sanitation. 
Applied science is full of big, comprehensive projects for 
turning scientific knowledge into use in commerce, in war, 
in aviation, in agriculture, in animal husbandry, in naviga- 
tion, in the extraction and use of metals, in electrical ap- 
pliances, and in medicine. 
It is in these very projects, objective and directly practical 
in their bearings, that children are best able to see the mean- 
ing and value of modern science in its influence upon life. 
What children in elementary schools need is not abstract 
scientific principles, not the systematic study of any or all 
the sciences (an impossible thing), but simple, objective, 
convincing demonstrations of the main ideas and uses of 
science in the home and neighborhood and in the larger 
world beyond. What could be better for children than to 
allow them to see these tangible projects developing and 
working out their proper, practical influence upon the con- 
ditions of life that surround them? These are preéminently 
needful and instructive topics that should be given the 
right of way in the elementary curriculum. 
Fourthly : Many of the stories and undertakings described 
in biography and history are large personal or national 
es projects in the full meaning of the term. For 
biography example, Columbus’ first voyage, the Panama 
and history Canal, Alexander’s first campaign into Asia, St. 
Paul’s missionary journeys, Grant’s movement against 
Vicksburg, the Lewis and Clark expedition up the Missouri 
and across the mountains, the voyage of the Mayflower,
-P-A-G-E-17
PROJECTS IN THE SCHOOL 9 
Livingstone’s explorations in Africa. In a large interpreta- 
tion, history consists of an account of men’s important 
projects in the building of cities, in the founding of states, 
in legislative programs, in reform movements, in founding 
institutions and societies, in warlike conquest, in territorial 
expansions, in the development of traffic routes and com- 
mercial policies. Especially in the story of leading his- 
torical characters do we find the personal impulse strong to 
execute some scheme or propagandist idea, some notion 
of progress, as illustrated in Hamilton’s plan for funding 
the national debt, Field’s project for laying the first Atlantic 
‘ cable, Stanley’s search for Livingstone, Howard’s scheme of 
prison reform, Franklin’s proposed Albany plan for the 
union of the colonies, Jefferson’s purchase of Louisiana. 
The enthusiastic personal element that plays through these 
individual yet social projects lends an unusual strength to 
such topics. ‘The man’s life and energy are absorbed into 
and identified with the undertaking. He becomes a power- 
ful and living exponent of a national or world idea. For 
instructional purposes such projects, thus reénforced by 
personal, objective demonstration, are of surprising value. 
We can afford to work out such projects descriptively and 
more or less exhaustively till we find a full background for 
the main idea, the completed purpose. 
Fifthly: The masterpieces of literature are the outcome 
of thought projects conceived and elaborated in the minds 
of authors, for example, Plato’s Republic, St. waster 
John’s Gospel, De Foe’s Robinson Crusoe, Shake- piesa 
speare’s Macbeth, Longfellow’s Building of the considered 
Ship, Fiske’s Critical Period of American History, ** fleets 
Plutarch’s Lives. A drama or novel or poem is the 
energy of the author’s thought working itself out and   
 
-P-A-G-E-18
10 TEACHING BY PROJECTS 
projecting itself into a great thought-movement. It is 
active and stimulating, and yet is caught and held somehow 
in a permanent artistic form. A masterpiece is a tangible 
literary project, a rational undertaking looking toward a 
well-planned achievement. Literary products are the 
greatest projects of the human mind and as such they are 
the best examples of great thought units, of knowledge 
rightly organized and artistically grouped. As perfected, 
energized thought-movements, complete units of effort, 
they demand thoughtful, elaborate, progressive study. 
The outcome of such study is a full appreciation of their 
constructive, dynamic quality and their final unity. 
By a survey and comparison of these various interpreta- 
tions of the term project as seen in the several studies, we 
may conclude that it is a practical, untechnical word with 
which to designate a variety of big, vital topics. It lays 
‘stress upon the actual and objective in present and past 
experiences. It deals with an energetic, growing idea, 
concretely embodied, that expands into a strong, even, 
national influence. Projects force attention upon the main 
objects of study, the chief enterprises that make up the 
warp and woof of real life in our times. < 
At the present moment we need to be jolted out of our 
conventional, formal school phrases and to find terms better 
a adapted to the educational needs and forces of 
life and the hour. The term project is a newcomer among 
educational phrases. It seems to suggest not the 
school but the shop, not the textbook but the busy mart, 
the industrial life, the unhallowed things of the schemer 
and the promoter. Perhaps this is its merit, that it forces 
attention upon things that have come to importance in 
life, things which need to break over the threshold into the reality 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  PROJECTS IN THE SCHOOL II 
school. The project idea suits our present needs because 
it tosses aside our conventional abstractions and sets up 
a larger practical unit of knowledge as the basis of study. 
We have been dealing with things of minor import till we 
have lost sight of the centers of thought, the big object 
lessons. We have devoted ourselves to facts, mere facts, 
isolated facts,— yes, detached and meaningless facts. 
The children have been surfeited with facts. But it is 
time to stop making collections of blank cartridges and 
begin to gather only those things that have explosive ma- 
terial in them. Again, we have played with school phrases 
and generalities and summaries till they cease to express 
thought. It is time to cast out this mummery and to deal 
with live thoughts embodied in real projects. 
The term project suggests a return to life, to business, to 
applied science, to daily duties and common human needs, 
to forces operative in the concrete world. The school is 
absorbing into itself as fast as it can the big things of life, 
the schemes that men and women are chiefly concerned 
about, and these are becoming our school topics. The 
project accentuates this demand for the practical and 
demonstrable. By a proper extension of the term it in- 
cludes several groups of big, constructive units of study in 
history and geography and science, and culminates in the 
masterpieces of literature and works of art, as poems, 
buildings, sculptures, and paintings, because these at 
their best are great designs worked out by artists to express 
the mind’s boldest flights into the world of experience, the 
supreme purposes and projects that men have conceived. 
The project, as such, is an apt device for teaching, be- 
cause it touches off any important enterprise at its most 
interesting crisis, namely, at that juncture where it is in

CHAPTER XXII. “ 
STATISTICS OF STATE COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 
PRELIMINARY REMARKS, - 
It was not possible at the time of closing the following tables to present in’ full the 
statistics of common schools in the United States for the school year1888-89. The | 
figures which follow are compiled from the most recent information received, about 
three-fourths of the States and Territories being represented by reports’ for the year 
1888-89. The corrected totals will be given in a future report. 
‘The population heretofore has heen given for that June which fell near the heginning 
of the school year reported; in this report it is given for the June of that calendar year 
in which the school year reported closed; 7.¢., if the school year reported is 1888-89, 
the population is computed for June, 1839. This method is preferable on several 
grounds, one obvious advantage being that the official census figures of 1890 will now 
be used in connection with the.schoo! statistics of 1839-90, instead of waiting for those 
of 1890-91. On account of this change, however, the enrollment, expenditure, etc., 
per capita of population and of school population, as given in this report, is not com- 
parable with the same data as given in previous reports. The corrected statistics of pre- 
vious years are given in the present report, pages 9-31. 
The United States census of 1890, in connection with that of 1880, has been used as 
a basis for computing the population given in the following table (column 3). It there- 
fore very closely approximates the actual population at the epoch given (mainly 1889); 
the percentages based upon it are probably accurate as far as carried out,   
TABLE 1,—Estimated population and population per square mile; number of pupils en- 
rolled; same compared with the enrollment of the previous year and with the population; all 
mainly for 1888-89 (the population being given for the close of the school year).

Enrollment.—The latest returns of enrollment of pupils in the common schools foot, up 
to 12,291,259, being an increase of 220,903 over the corresponding returns of one year pre- 
vious. The increase inenrollment has been at the annual rate of 1.83 per cent. as against 
‘an increase of 2 per cent. per annum reported a year ago and as against an annual in- 
crease of 2.17 per cent. in the school population the present year. 
The progressive decrease of public-school enrollment since 1870 in the NorthermStates 
has already been demonstrated in tables published by this office. It now appears that < 
North Atlantic Division increased 1.90 per cent., the enrollment only 0.44 per cent.; in 
the North Central Division the school population increased 1.73 per cent., the enrollment 
only 1.66 per cent. In every North Atlantic State in which a school census was taken 
the school population was found to have increased at a much greaterrate than theschool 
enrollment. 
In four of the North Atlantic States and in two of the North Central States there has 
been an absolute decrease in the enrollment. The increase of enrollment in New York 
has only been 544, against an increase of school population of over 30,000. 
‘The presentation of these facts affords still further confirmation of the relative decline 
of public-school attendance in the North, in addition to what has been already pub- 
lished. : 
In the South Atlantic States the increase of school population the past year was at the 
rate of 2.05 per cent., of enrollmentat the rate of 0.21 per cent. per annum. Here the 
same decline is observable as at the North. Exceptional agencies were at work, how- 
ever, to bring about the greater part of this decline in Georgia, and it is believed that 
it will be only temporary. A provision of the so-called Denny law, which was in oper- 
ation in Georgia in 1888, required an additional enrollment of at least twenty-five pupils 
jin order to establish a school after one had been provided for each race in each dis- 
trict; this had the effect to diminish the number of schools in the country districts; and, 
on account of the unfavorable crops many farmers’ children were obliged to workin the . 
fields, which further tended to. reduce the enrollment. The provision of the law of 
Georgia referred to has since been repealed. 
The South Central Division shows an increase of enrollment of 4.26 per cent., which 
- 
2.42 per cent. 
As has been stated, the proportion of population enrolled, as given in column 8, is 
not comparable with the same quantities in. previous reports. For the percentage of 
population enrolled in previous years, since 1870, see Chapter I.

         Average daily attendance. — —The average number of pupils attending the common 
‘schools, according to the returns made to the Bureau, was 8,004,275, there being a total 
gain of 100,068 over the corresponding reports. of avyear previous, or at the annual rate 
of 1.27 per cent. This rate of increase was less than that of the enrollment, 1.83 per 
cent., which indicates a decreased regularity of attendance. __ 
In fact, the average number of pupils attending for each 100 enrolled was reported 
last year as 65.7; this year, 65.1. . 
The number of States showing a decrease of average attendance is remarkable, Six 
States of the North Central Division—Indiana, Dlinoi: , Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, 
- and Kansas—report a decrease in average attendance si ultaneously with an increase of 
_ enrollment, In the States of that division there was a net decrease in average attend- ~ 
ance of 40,166; and the average number attending for! each 100 enrolled fell from 65 to 
62.8; the ¢ enrollment itself increased 80,486. 
“This condition of affairs, especially in Indiana, is a: omalous and naturally suggests 
imperfections in the statistics as reported, especially as all the remaining divisions show 
an increased ratio of average attendance over the preceding year. Yet the circumstance 
that so many of the North Central States are affected and participate in this abnormal 
decline, points to some agency tending to diminish school attendance in that section of | 
the Union not yet brought to the notice of the Bureau.

Aggregate number of days’ attendance.—This is a fundamental quantity of great value oa 
for statistical purposes, which needs to be more generally considered. 
The data for directly obtaining it may be found on most school registers. It is only 
necessary to add up the number of pupils present each day to get the aggregate days’ 
attendance for the year for any school. 
The aggregate number of days’ attendance of a school for a year divided by the — 
number of days the school was kept during the year, gives immediately the average 
daily attendance of that school for the year. 
Here are two radical quantities of prime importance determined for each school, (1) 
aggregate attendance in days, and (2) average daily attendance of pupils, which may Nee 
be consolidated for any number of schools by simply adding up. The city and country 
schools may be kept distinct, as well as the white and colored schools. When they have 
been consolidated for a township, for instance, the average number of days the schools 
have been kept in the townships may be directly obtained by dividing one of these 
quantities by the other. So for a county or State, and in any classification desired. i 
How the aggregate attendance was obtained.—The aggregate number of days’ attend- 4 
ance, as tabulated in column 2 of Table 5, has been obtained for each State, when not | 
‘reported directly to the Bureau, by an inverse process, i. e., by multiplying the aver- 
age daily attendance by the average number of days the schools were kept; this process 
of evolying a simple quantity from composite ones is obviously the reverse of the 
natural order, but was the only method that could be pursued in order to obtain it. 
The aggregate number of days’ attendance upon the common szhools of the United 
States, as obtained by this process of computation, is found to be 1,076,613,716, as given 
incolumn 2. This quantity is approximate, but may be considered sufficiently accurate ‘ 
for most purposes. 
How the length of the school term was summarized.—The summaries of column 4, Table 
5, being the average number of days the schools were kept in the United States and in se 
each of its divisions, have been obtained by the rule given above, 7. ¢., the aggregate 
days’ attendance of the division in question or of the United States has been divided by ~ 
its average daily attendance. 
This method, in effect, gives to each State or other aggregation a weight proportionate 
to its average number of pupils and not proportionate to its number of schools. The 
pupil is considered as the unit and not the school, as heretofore. Accordingly the large 
- dty schools with their long terms have their due influence in determining the average

school term; one of, these schools may count as much as a score of country schools, as should be the case when it is so many times as large. The general effect has been to 
give thé summaries of the average number of days the schools were kept in the present 
report larger*values than previously. Such decidedly urban systems as those of Rhode 
_. Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia, especially, receive their - 
due weight in making up the average. 
There have been somé considerable changes in the length of the school term of the 
individual States, in two cases exceeding twenty days, if correctly reported, and in four 
others between ten and twenty. The average change for the United States has been an 
' increase of nine-tenths of a day.

Private schools. Statistics of private schools continue of the same meager and unsatis- 
factory character as heretofore. The foes results are deduced from the data reported 
tothe Bureau: © ‘ 
Sixteen States and Territories eee an increase of private-school enrollment of 7.10 
per cent., the public-school enrollment of the same increased 1.44 per cent., the whole 
enrollment, public and private, increasing 2.07 per cent, ‘ 
These results tend in the same direction as those of preceding years, and give addi-_ 
tional confirmation to the statement heretofore made that the private schoolsate growing 
at a greater rate than the public. , 
Individual States, such as Vermont, Rhode Island, Tilinois, Colorado, Washington, 
and California, show au opposite tendency the present year, the public enrollment in 
those States growing faster than the private. i 
The statistics of private schools are of such varying degrees of accuracy from year to 
year, however, that conclusions derived from isolated data are open to suspicion, espe- 
cially if they indicate any rétrogression in the Northern States, which should rather be 
attributed to incomplete returns, 
Out of every 1,000 pupils in schools of all kinds, in 21 States and Territories, 97 were 
private-school pupils, a little less than 1in 10, The report last year,,embracing neatly 
the same States, was 94 per 1,000. The estimate for the whole of the United States is

According to the school census of August, 1889, there were 522,691 children between | 
‘7 and 21 years of age, an increase of 36,702 since the census of 1887; the average annual 
rate of increase for the two years was 3.76 per cent. ‘ 
Meanwhile the enrollment increased during the year 1888-89 only 2,915, or 1.09 per 
cent, ; and the school expenditure, $6,639, or less than 1 per cent. The increase in en- 
rollment and expenditure is not keeping pace with the increase in population. This is 
progress backwards. During the coming year, however, the State appropriation will be 
increased by $100,000; still, the increase of educable children is so rapid that this ad- ‘ 
dition to the school fund will not materially increase the amount apportioned per capita. 
A substantial enlargement of the school fund will be necessary to provide a sufficient 
number of country schools and to enable them keep open an average of over three 
and one-half months, i 
SIGNS OF PROGRESS. 
On this point Superintendent Palmet says: ‘‘ There is no denying the fact that there 
is an interest feltin our public-school system never felt before. The system is regarded, _ 
as it should be, as one of the prime factors in the material, social, moral, and intellectual — 
advancement of the State. This was evidenced by the act of the last legislature in in- 
creasing the direct appropriation from the State treasury by $100,000. It isshown by 
the unusual activity of county superintendents in holding county institutes, and by the 
teachers in their cheerful attendance upon these institutes. It is shown by the demand

   of the,people for well qualified and specially trained teachers to instruct their children. _ 
It is shown by a willingness, never seen before in most counties, to supplement the _ 
meager Stateappropriation. Itisseeninall our towns and cities, where spacious school- 
houses and ample funds are being provided to run the schools continuously from eight 
fo ten months each year. It is seen in the unusually large number of young men and 
women attending our normal schools to prepare themselves for teaching. It is seen 
in the interest manifested by the newspapers of the State in constantly keeping before 
the public the question of education. It is seen in the large attendance of young men 
and women in our higher institutions of learning, both public andchurch. Never in the 
past were the signs more favorable for a general educational advance throughout the 
State. When we remember that the close of the war found us without any means for 
the current expenses of running the State government, much less that of the public- 
school system, our wealth destroyed, our labor system demoralized, our people con- 
fronted with the gravest social and political problems that ever confronted any people, 
that no longer than fourteen years ago our State was groaning under an indebtedness of 
more than $30,000,000—more than one-third of all the taxable values, realand personal, 
owned by her citizens—when we remember that six years ago the State only appropria- 
fed $130,000 direct from her treasury for public schools, we certainly have just cause for 
~ fecling that much progress has been made, and that, too, in the face et most formidable   
9 difficulties. ‘ i V 
_.. **But while much has been accomplished, still. more remains to be done. The prog: 
zess of the past should not only encourage us, but should stimulate us to renewed 
efforts to make the educational facilities of our State equal to the constantly increasing 
_ demands upon it. Illiteracy still abounds, a menace to the State and a blot upon our 
 eivilization.”? f 
CITIES AND SEPARATE DISTRICTS. ¢ 
Baz. ‘ ‘ 
The improvement in city schools is one of the most hopeful signs of advance made in 
the Southern public-school system. The cities are becoming the educational centers, 
from which will radiate the influences tending to elevate the standard of all the schools 
of the State. In Alabama ‘marked progress,’’ says the superintendent, ‘‘is being 
made in the educational facilities of our cities and towns. In this regard, as might be 
- expected, Birmingham takes the lead. During the past year Powell School has been 
furnished with an elegant school building at a cost of some $60,000. _ A training depart- 
- ment for teachers has been added to the high school. Other cept buildings are 
“being arranged for. ~ ‘ 
. Selma is building a fine brick public-school building on the site of Dallas Academy, 
_ costing $18,000. Eufaula, Tuscumbia, and New Decaturare each building $10,000 public- 
school buildings. Tuscaloosa has just finished a $20,000 building for her public schools, 
Gadsden has procured a good building for her public school, which is just organized 
and gives promise of fine work. And so the good work goes on. Others might be men- 
- tioned, and no doubt still others will be heard from next year.’’ f s

ENUMERATION AND ATTENDANCE. 
_ . Of the 157,243 children between 4 and 16 years of age Roe in January, 1889, 
_ 127,089 are reported as attending public schools, 18,269 private schools, and 29,425 not 
attending school at all. The increase in the number of children attending private 
schools was slightly greater than the increase in the number attending public schools, 
and of course represented a mueh larger percentage of increase. Of the 27,335 not at- 
tending school, only 2,090 were between 8 and 14 years of age, the period of compulsory 
attendance. Many of those enrolled, however, attended very irregularly. This evil, 
of irregularity is one of the most serious difficulties the schools me to encounter. : 
EMPLOYMENT oF CHILDREN, f 
By recent enactments the employment of children between eight and fourteen years 
of age is prohibited in nearly all the leading industries except that of agriculture. 
‘Thus by removing from parents the temptation to keep their children from school in 
order that they may earn a few dollars in some manufacturing establishment at a great 
expense to their future welfare, ts laws requiring attendance at aed have been ma- 
_ terially strengthened. If the children can not be made to contribute to the gain of 
parents, but must remain at home in idleness, there will no longer be any inducement 
_ to keep them from school. ‘The principle is now acknowledged that parents must not 
_ be allowed to deprive their children of the education which has been xo liberally and 
freely provided for them, in order that they may gratify their own wishes and inclina- 
tions. Those parents who have a due regard for the welfare and improvement of their 
children will not object to a law provided for their benefit; but when parents are will- 
_ ing to sacrifice their children’s interests for the sake of gain, itis time hr the authority 
of the law to intervene to prevent it. : k . 
; f 
NEW BUILDINGS. 
’ New school buildings have been erected in East Hartford, Glastonbury. New Haven, 
Cheshire, Naugatuck, Stonington, Bridgeport, Stamford, Torrington, Middletown, and 
Somers, at an expense of $188,906. ‘‘The town of Windham has conveyed to the State 
a beautiful site of six acres in the borough of Willimantic. Very careful plans fora 
' pbuilding have been made, and the basement walls are now built.” , 
| EXAMINATION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, 
The board of education has been carrying on for three years an investigation into the 
_ actual results of the public schools. Some of these results were published in the State, 
Report for 1887-88, and attracted widespread attention, disclosing they did a highly 
_ unsatisfactory condition of the primary schools in New London County. The results of 
        
-P-A-G-E-41
    a more particular examination of the graded schools of the same sare are contained © 
in the present report; they do not substantially modify the conclusions already reached. 
Two sets of specimens of penmanship are reproduced in facsimile. They are the work — 
of the pupils of two different schools in the same town, and illustratemost forcibly the 5 
difference between g goodand poor teaching. ‘The difference,’ says Mr. Hine, ‘tis wholly _ ves 
in the teaching. In justice to the children it must be said that they are not at fault. 
They have learned ail they could. What is the just verdict upon a system which’ ad- 
mits such inefficiency, and upon school officers who knowingly, year after year, not only 
permit but promote such an imposition upon helpless children ?”’ > 
‘“about two-thirds of the teachers havé a high-school education, which is a larger, 7) 
proportion than in ungraded schools. This does not appear to make much difference in ~ 
the quality of the teaching; certainly, at first, no distinct advantage is noticeable. 
‘“The standard for teachers’ certificates is generally higher. Ina few cases, exami- 
nations were conducted with a view to requiring moderate qualifications. In no place, 
however, is any training or professional skill required asa requisite for teaching. There Pee 
are districts where no substantial qualification isdemanded. Young women without © = = = 
training and education are legally approved and installed in school, ‘They teach as A. 
well as they can.”’ tt

TOWN MANAGEMENT OF SCHOOLS. 
                   
     In 1866 a bill was passed permitting towns. to adopt the town system of management 
of schools. Twenty-two towns are now operating their schools under this system, At 
the last session of the general assembly.a bill nearly identical with the former in its 
provisions, but requiring the schools to be managed under the town plan, was presented. 
LOCAL SCHOOL FUNDS. 
          
         
      
    
     
             
   It is now difficult to ascertain the origin of these different funds, many of them hay- — 
ing been granted during the eighteenth century, but it has been ascertained that many 
of them arose from gifts or bequests of benevolent persons. The whole amount of these 
funds is now $282,451, and all the losses since 1800 do not amount to more than $10,000, 
in striking contrast with, the history of the town deposit fund. About $175,000 of the 
whole amount was given before the year 1800, and since the public schools began to be 
wholly supported by taxation in 1872 very little has been given. Nearly all of it has 
been donated for the benefit of secondary schools. A large portion of the local school 
funds is held in Hartford and New Haven Counties—in the former $118, 220, in the lat- 
ter $66,055, 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
The general assembly of 1889 enacted the following: 
School term.—Public schools must be maintained at Jeast thirty-six weeks each year 
in districts having a school population of over fifty, and at least thirty weeks in others, ; i 
under penalty of forfeiting State school moneys; but no school need be kept where the ’ 
average attendance the previous year was less than eight, ab aie 
School libraries and apparatus.—Any town may purchase books and apparatus for ihe Ai 
public schools, and every town so purchasing is entitled to receive from the Binte treas- 
urer $5 for each 100 pupils or fraction thereof in each of its schools, 
State secretary.—The secretary of the State board of education is made ex officio amem- 
ber of the school committee of every town and district having a school in which teach- 
ers are appointed by the State board. 
Normat schools. —Two free normal schools are established, to be maintained at an ex- 
pense to the State of not exceeding $40,000 in the aggregate per annum. 
Town management.—Any town adopting town control must retain it five years, instead 
of two as heretofore, before a vote is taken on the question of abandoning it.

* _ GENERAL STATEMENT. i 
ih * ‘ i 
_ Dakota was never so prosperous in educational affairs as in her Jast year under a Ter- 
ritorial government. The large school system of the Territory has been carried on with- 
: out any other means of support than that of direct taxation. Numerous private schools 
ee jhave also been established and carried on; the people of Dakota will rival even those of 
: Ohio in the relative number of private schools they are maintaining. 
i It is anticipated thata marked improvement will take place in the schools when the 
State governments are put into operation, owing to the new impetus that will be given 
ae to education from the sale of the school lands and the passage of uniform school laws, 
me ‘ + , ’ 
  SCHOOL LANDS. i 
- |< Phe publieschools of the two Dakotas will rest upon a much firmer basis from the fact 
ie that the lands donated by the General Government now become available for school pur- 
poses. The number of acres in these lands is 1,715,009, and the average value per acre 
is $5.79, making the total value $9,929,902. Some of the school lands are quite valuable, 
those in Yankton County being estimated at $14.03 per acre, those in Cass at $11.05, 
those in Clay at $11, and those in Logan and Pembina at $10. ‘ 
eo. / TEACHERS. : 
’ One of the greatest disadvantages that Dakota has labored under heretofore has been 
 alack of well qualified teachers, but since the establishmentof two publicnormal schools, 
is one at Madison and the other at Spearfish, and of several private normal schools, this 
~__ want-will soon disappear. Many experienced teachers from the Kast are|also constantly 
increasing the number in Dakota. i | 
K f TOWNSHIP SYSTEM. i 
‘Another disadvantage has been a lack of uniformity in the school system; seventy-two 
counties operating their schools under the township plan, and sixteen under the district 
system. This has been a cause of much annoyance, but it is very probable that the 
township plan will soon be generally adopted. 
GRADED SCHOOLS OF THE CITIES. f 
_ The graded schools will compare favorably with the best in the East, and their success 
_ is manifested to some extent by the large per cent. of the school population enrolled. . 
+ ‘ePhese schools are all supplied with elegant and commodious buildings, the cost of 
which ranges from. $6,000 to $80,000. As a general thing they have a good supply of 
apparatus with which to carry on their work. The best trained teachers that can be 
found are employed to teach in these schools and good salaries are paid. These schools 
are now ready to take rank with the best of their kind in any of the States.’?

          The reports of the board of trustees and superintendents show Lie the public schools 
of the District of Columbia are in an excellent condition; that, judging from the fre- 
quent expressions of approval and high commendation of their results and the interest 
manifested by the pupils in their work, they are meeting with great success. Any child 
of the District, from the time it is able to grasp the rudiments of an edueation, can 
enter a public school, where it will be placed under the instruction of askillful teacher; 
it can pass from grade to grade, fully comprehending the studies of each without any 
unreasoiable mental exertion, until at last the boy or girl graduates from the high 
school with a thorough English education and, perhaps, some knowledge of higher . 
branches, and fully equipped for any of the ordinary avocations. Or, if he has been 
_ deprived of educational advantages in his childhood and is now required to support 
_ himself, he still finds the doors of the evening schools open to him, where he can spend 
_ an hour both profitably and pleasantly. The citizens of the District may justly take 
great pride in their educational facilities. f

{ ACCOMMODATIONS. | 2 
- During the last three years much has been done by the erection and extension of — 
buildings to accommodate the number of pupils attending; so that, while 12,089 out of. 
the 32,336 pupils attending school three years ago were limited to half-day sessions, 
during the year under review only 6,000 out of 35,764 pupils were limited to half-day | 
"sessions. If these extensions shall be continued a year or two longer, provision will 
then have been made for all the pupils, and thereafter it will only be necessary to pro- 
vide for the ordinary increase. : . 
The building now used for the colored high school is inconveniently situated for the 
pupils attending it, and is needed for pupils of lower grades in the immediate neighhor- 
hood. ' aise 
Although an additional building containing twelve class rooms, an armory, a library, 
and laboratories, has just been erected for the Washington High School, there has been 
so great an increase in the number of pupils that additional room is still needed. The 
enrollment in 1888-89 was 1,107, but in the session of 1890 there have already been en- 
rolled 1,400 pupils, and it is probable that in 1890-91 the number will reach 1,600. 
This is a larger number than can be accommodated or conveniently supervised, and it 
is therefore suggested that one of two courses be adopted—that the first gradé in the high 
school be relegated to the grammar schools and be made to constitute a ninth grade, or, 
else, that two new high-school buildings be erected, one on Capitol Hill, the otherin | 
Georgetown. ‘The first method could be adopted as a temporary expedient, but the ” 
second is the only one that ¢an permanently remove the difficulty. ‘This would also place 
a high school within the reach of a large number of pupils who are now under the neces- 
sity of walking a long distance or of paying street-car fares. In either case much time 
is lost. ' 
TEACHERS’ SALARIES, 
One of the most urgent needs to be supplied is an increase in the salaries of teachers, 
especially of the high-school teachers. Not only do they deserve higher salaries, but it 
is found that they can not otherwise be retained. With a few exceptions, all ofthe ac- 
complished teachers employed in the Washington High School four years ago have re- '\ 
signed in order’ to accept more luctatiye positions. Nearly all of these teachers are 
leading graduates of such institutions as Dartmouth College, Johns Hopkins University, 
Amherst, Vassar, Cornell, Wellesley, and the Columbian University, and after an ex- 
perience of one or two years they can easily command a higher salary than the present 
restrictions permit. It is true that the average salary paid teachers here is equal to that 
paid in other cities, but there are conditions existing here which are not found there. , 
In other cities there are manufacturing and other enterprises which call for the work of 
the larger boys and girls, consequently they are withdrawn from the schools. But here 
nearly all of the pupils continue through the fifth grade, and about two-thirds of them. 
continue through the entire course. A great many children here are sent to private 
schools for two or three years and then enter the public schools. For these reasons we 
find the proportion of pupils in the higher grades here much larger than in other cities. - 
Consequently the average salary should be larger. eer 
EVENING SCHOOLS. 
These schools had a larger attendance than ever before and many of those who for- 
merly attended showed their appreciation of and interest in them by returning again. 
‘These schools furnish educational opportunities to many. boys and girls who labor dur- 
ing the day, and also to many adults. The course of studies should be enlarged and 
some forms of manual training, such as cooking and sewing, should be included. 
MANUAL TRAINING, 
The introduction of manual training into the schools has proved eminently satisfac- 
tory; it has not only not retarded the progress of the pupils but has seemed to give 
them increased interest in their studies. Many useful lessons were given in cooking 
and sewing, and the general report is that the parents heartily indorse it and the pupils en- 
joy a change from the regular routine. In the Washington High School 200 pupils in the 
first and second year classes, who had not taken cooking lessons the'year before, received 
instruction. 
FREE TEXT-BOOKS, 
Text-books are loaned to pupils whose parents declare their inability to purchase 
them, but there are many parents who dislike to make such a statement, although they
-P-A-G-E-46
    LA if 
could truthfully do so. It often occurs, too, that children are withdrawn from school _ 
~when they reach the higher grades on account of the expense of text-books. For these 
and other reasons it is thought best that free text-books be furnished to the pupils; the 
expense after the first year would probably be less than one dollar per pupil. 
SCHOOL DAY. 
It is suggested that the school day of the primary schools be extended to four and 
one-half hours, closing at 3 p.m. ‘This is particularly desirable in the surburban- 
schools, where many of the children’ in the primary grades are quite large. 
SUPERVISION. : 
The supervisors of the schools are intelligent and capable and are diligent in their 
work, but on account of the large number of schools they must supervise, and the num- 
ber is continually increasing, it is impossible for them to give the close and careful at- 
tention which each school deserves. The number of supervisors is much smaller in 
‘proportion than the number employed in other cities. At least two additional super- 
visors are needed at present.

The people of Florida are to be congratulated upon the excellent school facilities with 
which they are now provided; all the children of the State, both white and colored, are 
-within easy access of a school, and high schools are being established in every county, 
so that boys and girls who complete the course of the ordinary common schools may 
continue their education still further. The people are taking greatinterestin the schools 
and appreciate the advantages derived from them. All of the public school funds, ex- 
cept $37,000 derived from the proceeds of lands, are raised by taxation. New school- 
houses, well planned with regard to light and ventilation, are being constructed wher- 
ever needed and provided with the most improved furniture. The school officers, 
although not experienced teachers in all cases, are good business men, energetic and faith- 
ful, and ever on the alert to improve their schools. 
COUNTY HIGH SCHOOLS, 
It is the aim at present to organize and operate in every county one free high school 
at the county site or some more suitable place, and when the counties shall have in- 
creased in wealth and population other high schools may be established. Several of the 
most enterprising counties have already established such high schools and they are giv- 
ing great satisfaction. These schools are designed to fit their pupils for business pur- 
suits or for entrance into colleges. 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING, 
‘The State board of education, being convinced of the importance of this subject, in 
1886 called the attention of county superintendents and boards of instruction to the im- 
portance of giving boys in the public schools some lessons in the handling and use of 
tools, and of instructing girls in cooking, sewing, ete. One difficulty encountered is the 
scarcity of teachers capable of giving such instruction. It is now taught, however, in 
the agricultural and normal colleges, and in several of the city schools.

     REFORM SCHOOL. “    
‘The attention of the legislature was called to the importance of establishing a reform 
school where vagrant and vicious boys and girls might be taken in charge and educated. 
At present, when a boy at school is found to be ungovernable he is dismissed, and thus 
the probabilities are that he will grow still worse. Such a school should be separated 
from the evil influences of city life, and the pupils should not only be instructed in the 
ordinary branches of an education, but they should be taught different trades, so that 
they would afterwards be enabled to lead honorable lives. : ‘    
ARBOR DAY. 
The 14th day of February was appointed as Arbor Day, and the county superintend- . 
ents were instructed to see that theday was properly observed. The number of schools 
observing the day was 476, the number of pupils participating 13,468, and the number 
of trees planted was 5,353. Oaks, cedars, magnolias, hickories, and fruit trees were 
planted, and, in addition, many church premises and cemeteries were cleaned up, 
Nore.—We quote the following from a letter ofa superintendentof schools in Florida: “We have about 200 pupils in the schools, with no State or county funds from which to obtain anything but advice and teachers’ salaries, the school buildings and seats, which cost $6,000, being the gift of private citizens,”

MORMONS AS PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS. 
During the year the question arose whether Mormons were legally qualified to teach 
+ school. Superintendent Stevenson decided that ‘‘inasmuch as the law declared that no. 
certificate should be granted to any person who is not known to be a law-abiding citizen 
and of good moral character it was the duty of the county superintendent to reject any 
applicant who failed in the above particular, notwithstanding the fact that the appli- 
cant had passed a satisfactory examination; that all persons who indulged in practices 
prohibited by law or who belong to or aid, support, or assist in the support of or encour- , 
age any order, organization, or association that teaches such practices so prohibited by 
~ law, or who teach, counsel, or advise any person to belong to such an order or organiza- 
tion, were not law-abiding citizens within the meaning of the law, and could not be 
allowed to teach in the public schools or draw public money.’’ 
% DISTURBANCES, 
_ ‘In the southern counties, commonly known as the Mormon counties, there is a de- 
cided opposition to the public school system manifested by members of the organiza~ 
tion known as ‘ The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,’ or Mormons,

    “This sect, dominating the souls, minds, and actions of its devotees, has used and is 
still using its influence against the successful operation of the school laws. Many Mor- 
_ mons refuse to send their children to school unless the teacher is of the same faith. 
Every Mormon from childhood up is a teacher, compelled to teach their peculiar doc- - 
trines to all who will listen, especially to those under him, This being the case, it is 
no wonder that ‘Gentiles’ refuse to, allow their children to be placed under such influ- 
ences. Thus the public school is between two fires, but is gradually getting out. The 
strong hand of the law is too powerful for such a state of affairs to last long, and soon 
' the cause of free education will shed its light in the dark paths of intolerance and priest- 
craft. The school offices are gradually getting into the control of the ‘ Gentiles,’ and 
_ the result in each district is an awakening of educational interest. 
‘‘An act was passed at the last session of the legislature compelling all who withdrew 
from such an organization to declare their intentions before the clerk of the district 
court, and they can not vote until two years have elapsed thereafter. This is made ap- 
plicable to all elections.”’    
   
SCHOOLHOUSES, 
. “During the school year ending August 31, 1889, ithas been very gratifying to observe 
. the awakened interest regarding the building of new and commodiousschoolhouses. AS 
will be seen in an accompanying table, there has been an increase of thirty-five school- 
houses, and they for the most part have been erected on sites the title of which is vested 
' in the district. There seems to be a growing desire for the districts to own the realty. 
‘A great many districts have erected their schoolhouses on Government land, from which 
they can be and are often moved atthe whim of the board of trustees. When, however, 
the district owns the land the building is anchored, so to speak, and the grounds become 
the subject of ornamentation and decoration. Thousands of trees were planted with 
- interesting ceremonies on Arbor Day, which in a few years will beautify and adorn these 
temples of education.” i 
“Tn some counties there is a decided opposition to the public schools, unless they are 
- in control of the religious denorfination which is most nnmerous. Many schoolhouses 
are erected by popular subscriptions, and are used alike for school and religious pur- 
poses. In many districts the buildings are owned by religious organizations and are 
rented by the district. In Bear Lake County twelve out of the fifteen districts rent 
buildings from the peculiar sect there prevalent and dominating. Five are thus rented 
in Oneida County. Under such circumstances the power of the church is thrown against 
the erection of public schoolhouses, and the course of public education is trampled under 
the foot of religious fanaticism.’’ i ’ 
“Probably the most substantial and beautiful educational structure in Idaho is situ- 
ated at Boisé City, being the property of anindependent district. Hailey and Bellevue 
are not far behind. Lewiston and Moscow possess large three-story frame buildings, 
endowed with all of the latest improvements. Beautiful and creditable schoolhouses 
have been erected at Caldwell, Shoshone, Idaho City, Ketchum, Pocatello, Blackfoot, 
Eagle Rock, Salmon City, Genesee, and Albion. Elegant buildings are-under process 
' . of construction at Rathdrum, Weiser City, and otherpoints. Many districts are adding 
_ the latest globes, physiological and historical eharts, geographical maps, dictionaries, 
. and other appliances,” — 
INDEPENDENT DISTRICTS. 
~ * A general law for the establishment of independent school districts has been ‘‘enacted 
by the legislature, with a-view of providing better educational facilities for special 
localities. Any school district which has within its limits taxable property of the 
amount of $200,000 or over may be organized into an independent school district. It 
then has power to sue and be sued, to haye-a corporate seal, to hold and convey such 
real and personal property only as is needed for actual school purposes, and to choose 
such officers as are provided by law. The board of trustees have complete control within 
the powers delegated to them by law.”’ i 
Two districts have been already organized under this law in addition to Boisé City 
and Lewiston, which had previously been organized under special enactments. 
SCHOOL LANDS. 
The lands reserved for the support of the public schools amount to 970,240 acres. 
_ These lands will not become available until Idaho is admitted asa State into the Union.

TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 
Reports from every county in the State indicate that there is a very general desire to 
administer the law faithfully. Considering the difficulties naturally arising when a new 
branch is introduced into the course of study, the progress made is very encouraging, 
The attention the subject received last year in institutes greatly assisted teachers in their 
work, Much more will be accomplished during the coming year. x 
The superintendent recommends a law making it a misdemeanor, punishable by a 
heavy fine, to sell tobacco in any form to a minor under sixteen years of age. . 
NUMBER OF CHILDREN NOT ATTENDING SCHOOL. 
In response to a resolution of the general assembly the following information regard: 
ing the number of children between 8 and 16 years not attending school in city inde- 
» pendent districts was furnished by the State superintendent: 
  ‘Total number of children between the ages of 8 and 16. + 96,392 
Number at work in stores, shops; and factories., 6,740 
Number not in a school of any kind.......... . 13, 077 
     
It is true that in some instances the results have been estimated, but theyare sufficient 
to determine the fact that in all the cities there is a large number of children who are. . not in attendance upon any school: This number would undoubtedly be greatly in- creased if made to include those who have not been in attendance at school for twelve 
consecutive weeks during the past year. 
As a result, the enactment of'a stringent compulsory attendance law is recommended, 
regulating also the employment at labor of children of school age. 
THE TOWNSHIP SYSTEM. 
The adoption of the township system of organization is strongly urged. Itis remarked 
that if the people of the State could be made to understand how much time, and money,

‘The reports for 1889 show that ay money which j is paid ut for ‘ahucal purposes must 
pass through the hands of about 4,650 school-district treasurers; that the orders upon — 
_ which it is paid out must be drawn and signed by 4,650 secretaries, and that they must 
also-be signed by an equal number of presidents of boards of directors, Thus, under the 
present system, it requires some part of the time of about 13,950 different persons before 
the money reaches those to whom it is due. It is a fair estimate that, including officers, 
directors, and subdirectors, it requires over 25,000 persons to manage school aflairs, ‘

It is recommended that the enumeration of school children be made every alter- 
nate year instead of annually; also that the apportionment of schoo] moneys be made 
_ upon the basis of average attendance instead of school population; the money would thus 
reach those schools in which there is the most work-to be done on account of the large 
“number of pupils. In fact such an enactment, together with one providing for free text- 
_ books, would doubtless increase the attendance and act as a very efficient auxiliary to 
a compulsory law.

THE NEW STATE BOARD, 
Act 81, to regulate public education in Louisiana, was duly promulgated in 1888, 
This act was summarized in the Bureau’s Report for 1887-88, 
In accordance with the requirements of its first section a State board of education 
was appointed by the Governor, consisting of one member from each Congressional dis- 
trict—‘‘a decided improvement on the former method of organization of the board of 
education. In each district there is a representative gentleman who takes as. active in- 
terest in common schools and in general education.’? In addition to these there are’ 
three ex-officio members—the Governor, the State superintendent, and the attorney-gen- 
eral. 
TEXT-BOOKS. 
In compliance with section 3 of the school law, the State board of education adopted 
a list of books to be used in the public schools. Contracts were entered into with pub- 
lishing houses, stipulations being made to have the books sold at certain specified prices. | ~

DIGESTS or > STATE. ‘SCHOOL REPORTS. LOR ILD: 
Ree : - ATTENDANCE, 
The number of different pupils encotiod was smaller by 1,067 than in the previous year. 
- During each year of the preceding decade there was a decrease in the number of pupils; 
the entire decrease during that time being 8,835. ‘This constant loss is attributable in 
part to the parochial schools which have ‘been established in many places. It is esti- 
mated that 2,500 pupils attend parochial schools in Lewiston, Auburn, Biddeford, Saco, 
Waterville, Calais, and Westbrook. But another cause of the decrease i is the establish: 
ment of numerous high schools throughout the State. 
CHARACTER OF SCHOOLS, 
' During the seven years in which statistics have been collected showing the grades of 
the schools there was a decrease of 106 in the whole number of different schools, but an 
increase of 184 in the number of graded schools. This indicates a marked tendency to 
consolidate small schools into a few well-conducted ones. 
There was an increase of six in the number of ungraded schools ‘tenhitie history, and | 
of seventy-two in the number teaching bookkeeping; but there was a considerable de- 
crease in the number teaching physioiog: yy and hygiene. ; 
TEACHERS. 
The number of male teachers employed constantly diminishes, while the number of 
female teachers increases. The decrease in the aggregate number of terms taught by 
men during the last ten years was'867; the increase in the number of terms taught by 
women was 1,814. A larger number of experienced teachers and of graduates of normal — 
schools was employed, and the salaries of teachers were slightly higher; it is presumable, 
therefore, that more successful work “Was accomplished. 
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLHOUSES, 
Seven more towns have discarded the Alsiiee, system and adopted the town system 
instead; but one town, St. Albans, after haying tried the town plan for three years, has 
returned to the district system. 
Although’75 new schoolhouses were built during the year, there was an increase of 
only 5 in the number reported as in good condition. In the preceding ten years 680 
new schoolhouses were built, 579 of which took the places of old ones, and yet the num- ~ 
ber in good condition increased only 189. It seems, therefore, that some of the school 
buildings do not receive the care and attention which should be given them, 
FREE TEXT-BOOKS, 
The most important enactment made in many years in regard to educational matters 
was that of the recent legislature requiring that after August 1, 1890, towns shall fur- 
nish all pupils of the public schools with text-books at public expense. The funds nec- 
essary for this purpose shall be raised in the same manner as other public moneys. 
School committees shall select a uniform series of text-books, and shall contract with 
the publishers for the purchase and delivery of the same. No text-book thus introduced 
shall be changed in five years unless by a vote of the town; any person violating this 
provision shall forfeit five hundred dollars, to be recovered in an action of debt by any 
school officer or person aggrieved. School committees shall make such rules and regu- 
lations, not repugnant to. ‘law, as they deem proper for the distribution and preserving 
of schoo! books and appliances furnished pupils at the expense of the town. 
‘‘When a pupil in a public school loses, destroys, or unnecessarily injures any such 
schoolbook or appliance his parentor guardian shall be notified, and if the loss or damage is 
not made good to the satisfaction of such committee within a reasonable time they shall 
report the case to the assessors, who shall include in the next town tax of the delinquent 
parent or guardian the value of the book or appliance so lost, destroyed, or injured, to 
be assessed and collected as other town taxes.’’ 
Superintendent Luce advises the school committees to make no changes in the books 
used, except for very strong reasons, and that the books now in possession of pupils, 
when in good condition and of the kind. selected, be bought up and made a part of the 
town supply, and that the prices at which fature supplies of books'are to be furnished 
be determined in the contracts made with publishers. The requirement that books — 
'» shall be uniform does not prevent the use of two or more series of readers.

- of the school term they shall be returned, unless special ee to keep them daring 
vacation has been obtained. ; | _ - HIGH SCHOOLS. 
_ These schools are meeting with marked success and are evidently affording a grade of 
instruction for which there is a very general demand. 
In 1880 high schools were supported in 86 towns and were attended by 6,215 pupils. 
In 1888-89 they were supported, in 204 towns and were attended t by 14,900 pupils. Of 
the 28 new towns in which high schools were established, in 22 they were established 
by town action and in 6 by district action; this indicates that a much larger territory 
has been provided with high-school privileges. 4 
The cost of these schools was about $9.40 per pupil for the year. The high schools 
are proving to be of much advantage to the lower grades of the common schools by fur- 
nishing them with well-trained teachers and by relieving them of the work of instruct- 
ing a few scholars in the higher branches. 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
Superintendent Luce makes the following recommendations: 
1. ‘That school committees.and supervisors, in carrying into effect the free text-book 
law, study (1) to secure the best book at the least expense, making the fewest practica- 
ble changes, and utilizing by purchase or otherwise, so far as practicable, books owned 
by pupils; (2) to hold teachers and pupils to sharp and strict accountability, for careful 
usage and prompt return of books owned by the town; and (3) toso systematize the dis- 
- tribution and return of them by keeping proper records that the exact condition and 
location of every such book may be easily determined at the end of every term.”’ 
2. That they strictly enforce the laws for compulsory attendance. 
3. That they scrupulously guard against the admission of unfit teachers and endeavor 
to retain successful teachers. 
4, That in towns having abolished the district system regular courses of study be 
adopted for the ungraded schools, from which pupils may | be graduated in like manner 
as from graded schools. 
5. That they encourage the abolition of the district patent and the establishment of 
high schools. 
6. That they urge teachers to attend educational meetings, and that they themselves 
take part in such meetings. 
7. That they advise young teachers who show a natural aptitude for their work to 
he a professional course at a normal school. 
8. ‘That, in short, they seek to elevate the public schools of their town by pee ae 
earnest, persistent, and SeEresstye action as leaders in all educational reforms.” 
_ NEW LEGISLATION, 
‘Free text-books.—Towns shall furnish pupils of the public schools with free text-books. 
High schools.—‘‘ The course of study in the free high schools shall embrace the ordi- 
nary English academic studies, especially the natural sciences in their application to 
mechanics, manufactures, and agriculture; but the ancient or modern languages and, 
music shall not be taught therein except by direction of the superintending school com- 
mittees having supervision thereof.’? 
Any town may authorize its superintending school committee to contract with the 
trustees of any academy or high school for the tuition of scholars resident within such 
town; and the expenditures of any town for such purpose shall be subject to the same 
conditions and shall entitle such town to the same State aid as if it had made such ex- 
penditure for a free high school. 
Plantations have same powers as towns.—Plantations have the same powers and liabil- 
ities as towns for the formation of districts, collecting school moneys, ete. 
Evening schools authorized.—Cities and towns may raise and appropriate money for the 
support of evening schools, in which only the elementary branches shall be taught, but - 
pupils of any age shall be admitted. 
School law’ to be published biennially.—The State superintendent is required ‘*bien- 
nially, as soon as practicable after the adjournment of the legislature, to compile and 
have printed in pamphlet form three thousand copies of the amended school law of the 
_Btate and distribute the same to the municipal and school officers of the several towns,”?

no material change made in the school system of Maryland; no marked advance move- 
ment, and no step backward; there was the ordinary and natural increase in the num- 
ber of schools and teachers which was required by the normal growth in enrollment 
and average attendance. In fact, the schools and school system of Maryland have 
reached such a point of development that no radical change is \desirable, and we find 
that in fifteen years no change of importance has been made in theschoollaw. ‘‘ Mary- 
land is blessed in having many examiners of long experience—one from the beginning of 
the system i in 1865, several from its reorganization in 1868, and only a very fow of less 
than six years’ standing.’’ 
The teachers, as a whole, are intelligent and earnest in their work, and endeavor in 
many ways to render theniselves capable instructors. This is shown by their almost 
universal attendance on the teachers’ institutes and by the formation of reading circles, 
from which great improvement is derived. . 
The recommendation of the State superintendent that the few remaining county 
academies be made a part of the public-school system is heartily indorsed by the board 
of Frederick County. This board established high-school departments in the public 
school at Middletown and in the female school at Frederick City. These departments 
are well patronized and highly appreciated by those who have children to educate, and 
ane requests are received by the board for the extension of such facilities for higher 
education.

ATTENDANCE, } 
  “The compulsory school laws require all children in the State between 8 and 14 years 
of age to attend some public day school or some private school approved by the school 
committee for at least 20 weeks during each year, 
267,785; the number of children of all ages attending the public schools during the year 
was 363, 166, an increase of 5,166 over the previous year, but still not equal to the popu-, 
_ lation 5 to 15 years of age. This can readily be accounted for to some extent. Many 
oe ‘children, for various reasons, do not enter the public schools until they are 7 or 8 years 
of age; others leave them at 14 to learn some trade or to earn a livelihood. Again, 
_ 53,663 pupils were reported as attending private schools or academies. 
The’ per cent. of attendance based upon average membership was 90; in 18 towns it 
‘was above 95, in 15 it fell below 80. In the towns having these low averages there was 
_ probably much negligence on the part of both parents and school officers. 
‘The | law requires all the schools to be kept for six months and high schools for ten 
“months. Four towns haye failed to keep their schools for six months ae fifteen others 
at the limit. ; TEACHERS,

_ DIGESTS OF STATE SCHOOL REPORTS. 
_ years, while the number of women teaching has as constantly increased. In the cities: 
and largér towns the tenure of the teachers’ position is becoming more permanent, but 
in the poorer towns changes are constantly occurring. ] ‘ 
The proportion of teachers who have attended the State normal schools has greatly 
‘increased, and we may consequently infer that better work was done. The normal 
graduates also furnish many valuable lessons to other teachers around them and to 
many of their own pupils, who afterward become teachers and adopt the methods with 
which they have become a¢quainted. 
  HIGH SCHOOLS. 
‘The number of high schools in the State is 236, and 90 per cent. of the people now 
haye high-school privileges in their own towns. That these schools are highly appre- — 
ciated is manifested by the fact that high schools are maintained by a large number of 
towns not required by law to do so. z 
EVENING SCHOOLS. 
The number of evening schools maintained was 240, a larger number than in the pre- 
vious year, but the average attendance wassmaller, The attendance in these schools 
was very unsatisfactory, many persons attending a few evenings and then dropping out. 
EXPENDITURES. : 
The expenditures for school purposes are increasing from year to year, and the ratio 
of increase is slightly larger than the ratio of increase of school population or of school 
attendance. As the standard of teaching is being made higher, the salaries of teachers 
must also be higher. Better buildings are now required, and they must be better heated 
and ventilated. The sum of $22,118.38 was expended for the transportation of children 
in preference to sending them to small and poorly conducted schools. ' 
SUPERVISION, 
The school committees have long felt, that they could not give to the schools that _ 
degree of attention and superintendence which ‘they deserve, and in the cities special 
officers have been provided for thispurpose. ‘To aid the smaller towns in securing super- 
vision the legislature of 1888 passed the following act: 
“Srorion 1. Any two or more towns, the valuation of each of which does not exceed 
two million five hundred thousand dollars, and the aggregate number of’ schools in all 
of which is not more than fifty nor less than thirty, may, by vote of the several towns, 
unite for the purpose of the employment of a superintendent of schools under the pro- 
visions of this act. ' 
‘Src. 2, Whensuch a union has been effected the school committees of the towns com- 
prising the union shall form a joint committee, and for the purposes of this act said joint 
committee shall be held to be the agents of each town comprising the union. * * * 
They shall choose by ballot a superintendent of schools, determine the relative amount 
of service to be performed by him in each town, fix hissalary, and apportion the amount 
thereof to be paid by the several towns, and certify such amount to the treasurer of each 
town.” : 2 
The act further provides that whenever such union shall have raised by taxation $750 
for the support of a superintendent of schools a warrant may be drawn upon the treas- 
urer of the State for $1,000, one-half of which amount shall be paid for the salary of 
the superintendent and the other half for the salaries of teachers. 
Sixteen union districts have been formed under this provision, and ‘so far the plan 
gives great satisfaction. Some fear was entertained at first thatit would excite jealousy 
between the districts, but such has not been the result. The principal difficulty encoun- | 
tered has been that some towns have not been able to find others in their vicinity with 
which they could unite. 
Many advantages arise from the employment of school superintendents. The super- 
vision of the schools, especially of the smaller and poorer schools is more uniform and 
intelligent; the needs of the schools are more promptly supplied; there is more system, 
better organization and classification; teachers are ‘selected with greater care: there is 
greater economy in the purchase and use of supplies, and school property is better 
eared for, ‘ 
The powers and duties of the superintendents are essentially the same as those of the © 
school committees whose places they are mainly intended to supply, and whose approval 
they are expected to secure. They should endeavor to ascertain by examinations and

observation which candidates are most likely to prove successful teachers, and should 
recommend such to school committees for election. They should see that the courses 
of study are wisely arranged, and that the methods of imparting instruction are such 
as have proven satisfactory. The individual teachers, however, should be allowed full 
freedom in adopting new plans and experiments for giving increased interest to their 
exercises. ‘Che selection of text-books should be left by the school committee to the 
judgment of the superintendent and teachers who have used them in the class room. 
‘The superintendents should endeavor, as far as possible, to have schoolhouses properly 
located, conveniently arranged, well ventilated and lighted. They should endeavor in 
different ways to infuse into the people an interest in educational matters so that a full 
attendance of the school population may be secured. 
TRUANT SCHOOLS, 
The law requires all towns to provide for the confinement and instruction of truant 
‘children; but, as the number of truants in individual towns would frequently be small, 
it is provided that county truant schools may be established, to which the different 
towns may send their truants. In four counties, namely, Hampden, Berkshire, Hamp- 
shire, and Norfolk, truant schools have been established. All the towns of the State 
Should immediately provide for a faithful compliance with this law. 
. 
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
New impetus has been given to the importance of physical training of pupils by the 
recent discussions on this subject. Physical health and vigor are essential to full ac- 
tivity of the mind, as well as to a full measure of happiness and success in life. Every 
_ pupil leaving a public schoo! should possess both mental and physical vigor, mens sana 
_ in corpore sano. 
“ oh : PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
The number of private schoois reported is 396, an increase for the year of 48. 
Although the statistics of private schools are very imperfect, it is well known that the 
ratio of increase of attendance on private schools is much larger than the ratio of in- 
erease of public schoolattendance. It is to be regretted that recent events have brought 
about this condition of affairs, for the public schools being supported and controlled by 
the State, they are presumably better prepared to furnish a broad and liberal education. 
This condition of affairs does not call for restrictive legislation, however, but must be 
met by improving the public schools so that all citizens will prefer to have their chil- 
dren attend them.

    ATTENDANCE. 
Since 1880 there has been a small but almost constant annual decreasein the numberof | Aig 
children attending the publicschools as compared with the number of children in the State. 
This decrease amounted during the ten years to 5.4 per cent. Not only so, but in the 
year 1889 there was a decrease of 1,614 in the public school enrollment, although there 
was an increase of 10,146 in the number of children in the State. This decrease is still 
more remarkable when it is considered that a compulsory attendance law was passed in 
1883, and in 1885 an act for reformatory education of refractory youths. ‘The decrease 
in the per cent. of census children attending schools during the different years is here 
shown: 
     Ir BY Year. : Increase or \ Per cent.’ decrease. 
           
  No satisfactory explanation can yet be given-for this constant decrease, and sufficient 
information has not been obtained with respect to private schools to determine how fa: 
these may account forit. 5 1 X

The legislature passed an act requiring the district board of each school district to 
‘post in a conspicuous place, at least ten days prior to the first an ual school meeting 
from and after the passage of this act, a notice that those qualified to vote upon the ques- 
- tion of raising money in said district shall vote at such annual meeting to authorize said 
' district board to purchase and provide free text-books for the use of the pupils in said 
district. Ifa majority ofall the as-above-provided voters present at such meeting shall 
authorize said board to raise by tax a sum suflicient to comply with the ‘provisions of 
this act, the said district board shall make a list of such books,”’ and shall notify the 
State superintendent of the action of such meeting. Accordingly, at their next annual 
meeting 520 districts made provision for free text-books. ! 
uy SCHOOL LAW. 
ey f 
Besides the act with reference to free text-books, an act was passed requiring the 
supervisors of townships in which a fractional district is situated to include the propor- 
tion of the mill tax to be placed on their respective assessment rolls. @ 
An effort was made to secure the adoption of township school districts, but failed. 
‘A new edition of the general school laws, including a digest of the supreme court de- 
cisions, was published during the year. i 
TEACHERS. t 
The whole number of teachers necessary to supply all the schools was 10,637. The 
graded schools employed 4,201, only 184 more than was necessary to supply them, but the 
ungraded schools employed 11,874, or 5,254 more than were necessary. It is seen, there- 
fore, that on an average nearly any ungraded school employed two teachers during the 
ear. oe 
2 Of the 15,979 persons applying for county certificates 206 received first-grade certifi- 
cates, 554 second grade, and 10,361 third-grade certificates. ‘This indicates that there | 
is great need “of thoroughly competent and experienced teachers. ‘Too many of the 
teachers have engaged in the work only as a temporary business, and they are therefore 
lacking both in the necessary qualifications and in the desire to qualify themselves. 
Again, teachers have no strong inducement to enter upon the work as a permanent pro- 
fession, for they can secure no definite tenure of position. The teacher’s position is too 
often bestowed as a reward for personal or political favors instead of to the one most 
competent to discharge its duties. , f 
Although only 22 per cent. of the teachers are males, their telative number is con- 
stantly decreasing. In 1889 the number of men teaching was 92 less than in the pre- 
» vious year and 253 less than in 1886. On the contrary the number of women teaching 
was 312 greater than in the previous year. }

According to the public acts of 1889 the State board of education shall issue life cer- 
tificates to all persons who have taught for two years in the schools of the State and who 
shall upon examination be found to possess eminent scholarship, ability, and good moral 
character, Under the previous regulations for granting State certificates only forty- 
three persons had secured them during ten years, but since they have been made valid 
for life it is probable that they will be in greater demand.

The estimated value of the raialie schoo} property is $13,386, Gs , the amount ex- 
‘pended during 1889 for Rubies and repairs being $641,661. otwithstanding the 
large amounts spent upon school buildings, less than one-third of them are reported as 
_ properly heated and-ventilated. This is attributable in large part to the tendency so 
» prevalent a few years ago of erecting buildings of abnormal height and showy exterior - 
appearance, but having little regard to the comfort and well-being of the pupils. In the 
rural districts very little regard is had for the proper lighting and ventilation of school-_ 
houses, Sgesegnctly: when one part of the schoolroom is uncomfortably warm the other 
part is cold; but in the plans of city school buildings special attention is now given to 
these aims. anus

houses in many districts. Frequently but one building is provided for both sexes, and 
the boys and girls use it indiscriminately. Or, what is scarcely less disgraceful, the 
buildings are placed in close proximity to each other without any permanent. barrier 
between them. The effect of such a state of affairs upon the moral tone of the pupils 
and the terrible results that are likely to follow are too patent, to any one whose sense 
of decency is not entirely lost, to need even a statement. That they are allowed to'ex- 
ist is a sad commentary on the moral tone of a community, and implies at least a 
criminal negligence on the part of those school officers who permit it.’’ i ; 
EDUCATIONAL FUNDS. 
‘““The money derived from the sale of school lands and from escheats to the State 
constitute the primary school fund proper, and bear.7 per cent. interest. ‘The moneys 
derived from the sale of swamp lands donated by Congress constitute the primary school

‘«'The interest derived from each of these funds, together with the surplus of specific 
taxes remaining in the State treasury after paying the interest on the several educa- 
tional funds and the interest and principal of the State debt, forms the primary school 
interest fund, the entire amount of which that may be on hand at the time is appor- 
tioned to the school districts of the State semiannually, between the 1st and 10th days 
of May and November in each year.”’ : 
The primary school 7-per-cent. fund amounted, June 30, 1889, to $3,722,286, and the 
primary school 5-per-cent, fand amounted to $807,391.

GENERAL STATEMENT. 2 
That the year 1888-89 witnessed a great improvement in the educational progress of Mississippi is evident from several considerations. In the first place there were 919 
more schools, and the number of children sharing in the benefits of them was greater

by 51,218 than in the previous year. The ayerate daily attendance was greater by 
28,562, or 15 per cent., and the average length of the school term was one day longer. 
* During the last two years twelve cities and towns erected school buildings, at a total 
cost of $190,000. “‘In 66 counties the collections exceeded the disbursements by 
$191,300, while practically only 8 counties exceeded their collections, incurring a debt 
in all of about $15,000.’’ More than 800 country schoolhouses were built, at a cost of 
$116,951. There was an increase of 1,018 in the number of first-grade teachers, and it 
is therefore presumable that better work was accomplished. 
: j SCHOOLHOUSES. 
+ According to the enactments of the legislature the attorney-zeneral and State super- 
intendent of education were required to distribute the 2 and 3 per cent. fund received 
from the sales of Government land whenever the fund exceeded $15,000, The distri- 
bution was made in December, 1883, the amount distributed being $78,429.05. In 
order that as much as possible might be accomplished by means of the fund, the State 
superintendent issued a circular advising supervisors in the different counties to dis- 
tribute the fund to those districts that would supplement it in some way, by appro- 
priating unused balances of the common-school fund, by raising certain amounts, or 
otherwise. These suggestions were followed in many counties, and in nine months 
from the time of the distribution 475 new schoolhouses had been erected, and others were 
in the course of construction. In some counties the fund was prorated to the different 
districts, and little good was accomplished by it, while in others it was unlawfully ap- 
_ plied to the payment of teachers’ warrants. In Monroe County the fund was supple- 
mented by an appropriation of $2,000, and forty-oné new schoolhouses were erected, at 
er a‘cost of from $200 to $700 each, and others were repaired and furnished with stoves 
©. and blackboards. 
    _ SCHOOL CENSUS. : 
There are great discrepancies between the returns made by the auditors as to the 
number of children of school age and those made by the county superintendents. As 
a consequence there are no reliable data upon which a distribution of State funds can 
be made. 
‘ ‘SIXTEENTH SECTIONS. 
y ‘Mississippi received from the United States in sixteenth sections 661,000 acres. In 
lieu of sixteenth sections in Chickasaw cession, 174,550 acres.”? The leasing of these 
Jands was variously intrusted to boards of police, county school directors, county school 
, commissioners, and boards of supervisors. They haye nearly all been leased for ninety- 
nine years and the notes and revenues squandered. A satisfactory report of the fund 
» of Warren County, however, was made in 1889 by the county treasurer. The sixteenth 
sections of the Yazoo Delta, which has lately been found to possess valuable resources, | 
are still unleased, and should be saved to the State by appropriate legislation. The 
supervisors should be prohibited from leasing these lands for longer periods than eight 
years, and the rents should be invested in bonds and only the interest allowed to be 
used, t 
th UNIFORM EXAMINATIONS. 
The law of 1886 requiring uniform teachers’ examinations throughout the State, al- 
though it met with strong opposition, has been found an eminently wise one. That it 
has not pravenved competent teachers from passing the examinations successfully is 
evidenced by the fact that 1,018 persons received first-grade certificates. 
While admitting that many of the most intelligent and faithful county superintend- 
ents advocate annual examinations of teachers, Superintendent Preston thinks that, in . 
order to stimulate teachers to thoroughly qualify themselves for their work, certificates 
should be granted under certain conditions for a longer time than one year. He would 
have an annual examination of all holders of second and third grade certificates. All 
first-grade teachers who madeé an average of 85 per cent. should be licensed for two 
years and those who made an average of 90 per cent. for three years. Any person who 
received a three years’ license a second time should be entitled to teach in that county 
without any further examination. State licenses should also be granted to those who 
‘passed a special examination showing themselves possessed of broad scholarship and 
successful experience as teachers.

SUPERVISION. 
It is claimed by very many that county superintendents are useless factors in the 
school system and that the money paid them could be better devoted to the payment of 
teachers’ salaries. In those counties where the superintendents are incompetent or 
neglect the faithful discharge of their duties they are in reality useless appendages, 
but nothing can contribute more to the improvement and successful operation of the 
public schools than intelligent and faithful supervision. The excellence of the schools 
in cities and towns is attributable to careful supervision more than toanythingelse. Com- 
petent superintendents can not be had, however, unless they are adequately paid, and 
in many of the counties the salaries paid are entirely too low to secure good men. 
Superintendent Preston thinks that the law enacted in 1888, making the office of 
county superintendent an elective one, was a great mistake, and that it willsubject the 
person chosen to improper influencesin the granting of licenses and fixing teachers’ 
salaries. 
HIGH SCHOOLS, 
Besides the graded schools of the cities and towns, there were reported 150 high 
schools, normal schools, and denominational colleges. Some of these enrolled from 250 
to 400 students. Many of them were supported in part by the public funds, and gave 
free tuition during the public term. The success of these schools affords evidence of an 
appreciation by the people of higher education, as well as evidence of increased material 
prosperity. 
SEPARATE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. 
“Following the policy and practice of other States, Mississippi has from the begin-~ 
ning of her free-school system allowed her towns and cities to hecome separate schoo! 
districts. . 
“Tn the first public school law, enacted in 1870, the privilege was granted to towns 
having 5,000 population; in 1873, by amendment, to towns having 2,000; by the code 
of 1880, to towns having 1,000; by the revised law of 1886, to towns having '750. 
‘Many of our towns have special laws granting them full local control of their schools 
and power to levy a tax in support thereof. This legislation was demanded by their 
peculiar conditions, and is in exact accord with the universal practice of the other 
States of the Union. 
“Educational progress and activity are to-day most prominent in our separate school 
districts. Thirty-five towns are maintaining their schools from seven to ten mouths 
each year, their average school levy being four mills, and some of them levying as high 
as seven and one-half mills.” 
The State distributes $300,000 to the counties for school purposes. About two- 
thirds of this arises from liquor licenses, fines, and forfeitures; the other $100,000 is 
given from the general State fund. The funds distributed by the State would only 
maintain the school about one-third of the required term of four months; each county 
must maintain its own schools for the other two-thirds of the term. In this way the 
State seeks to equalize the burden of taxation and to encourage local support of the 
schools. Upon the same principle the separate school districts are allowed to retain 
their local levies, for while they pay about ene-third of the whole State fund, they only 
receive about $23,000 from it, Besides, ‘t reports from seventeen towns show an enroll- 
ment of 1,401 country pupils. Estimating the other eighteen towns at 1,000, we find . 
the separate school districts carrying 2,400 country pupils, or 12} per cent. of their en- 
tire attendance. 
“The counties pay the tuition of these pupils for four or five months, and the towhs 
let them continue in the schools the rest of the session absolutely free of charge.’’ 
NEW TEXT-BOOK LAW—COUNTY UNIFORMITY. 
A law approved February 22, 1890, provides for a uniform series of text-books in each 
county, to be selected by county boards of seven teachers each, and not to be changed 
for five years. :

teachet The uaa real condition of the schools was better than it has ever been, more and better, 
were employed, and they were paid hetter salaries. The financial condition of 
| the schools, too, was excellent. The settlements of the clerks and treasurers show that 
at the close of the year nineteen out of every twenty districts had paid all indebtedness 
and had a balanceon hand. All schools hereafter will have a term of at least six months. 
The citizens of the State may well congratulate themselves upon the excellent condition 
of the schools, for it is a well-recognized fact that the social and material welfare of a 
> State depends, to a large paints upon the education of its people. 
qf onions OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
There are many persons who are continually urging objections to the public schools: 
‘They allege that the public schools are Godless, that the Bible is not used in them, that 
the public schools are responsible for the increase of crime, and that they develop in the 
children indifference, profligacy, and unstableness of character. Before considering the 
objections of such persons it is well to ascertain whether these are the real causes of 
complaint, whether such persons would favor the public schools if these objections were 
‘removed, or whether, on the contrary, they have brought forward these objections be- 
cause they dare not disclose the true ones, ‘‘ What do they mean by Godless schools?” 
Nothing more nor less than this, their peculiar ideas and notions of religion are not 
sanctioned, espoused, and taught. ‘They want the Bible introduced and used as a text- 
book; but ‘what Bible? Introduce it, which can not be done without violating the con- 
stitution of our State, and these same parties will be the first to find fault, for they will 
soon see that this is a two-edged blade that cuts in hoth directions, for and peniney their 
preconceived views and aRBD GN

   “DIGESTS OF aeey scroon REPORTS. 
But it is asserted that the public schools are responsible for the large number of ‘erimi- 
nals, Where is the proof of such a charge? Although the public schools draw large 
numbers of pupils from the poor, the vicious, and the ignorant, the classes most likely 
to furnish criminals, and who are debarred from entering private schools, we find very 
few criminals who have attended the public schools long enough to secure a good edu- 
cation, , If enrolled at all, they probably attended only ashort time, their attendance was 
irregular, and they were already so vicious that they properly belonged to the reform 
schools. But even if it be granted that many of the criminals.were educated in the pub- 
lie schools, is it probable that. they would otherwise not have been criminals? ‘The 
censors of the public schools say nothing of the hosts of tradesmen, mechanics, laborers, 
teachers, lawyers, ministers, and statesmen who were educated in the public sehonsi: 
and many of whom received there the impulse which resulted in their success.    
    
      
        
          
        
        
              
            
    
        
        
        
        
        
      
       
        
      
        
      
                
        
                
        
        
       
SCHOOL TERM. 
Hereafter the minimum length of the schog}.term of each district shall be six months 
. ‘instead of four, provided a tax of 40 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation, together 
with the public funds, will be sufficient to maintain the schools-for six months. Dis- 
tricts can not now rely entirely upon the public funds, but the boards of directors are 
authorized to make out a tax of four mills on the dollar without any vote of the people. 
As the school terms will now be longer, it will be possible, to secure a better grace of 
teachers. 
WHAT SHOULD BE TAUGHT, . 
“Phe law should fully set out the subjects to be taught in all the public schools of - 
the State, and empower the board and the teacher to require each pupil to pursue the =< 
same uutil completed, and higher branches should be admitted only ‘by order of the ; 
board’ or by a vote of the people. Boys are well advanced in arithmetic who know 
nothing about grammar; girls apply themselves to grammar, but do not want to study 
arithmetic and United States history. -The result is, there is no gradation in the school, 
and education—in such school—simply means a partial knowledge of two or three text- x 
books. ; 
‘“The law on teaching the evil effects of aleoholic stimulants and narcotics upon the 
human system is a farce and fraud. It is virtually a prohibitionagainst temperancein- | 
struction in the public schools. And strangeas it may appear, those who claim to favor : 
proper legislation upon this subject fayored this measure, while they rejoiced over the 
defeat of senate bill No. 52, which required such instruction in all the schools of the 
State. The law as it stands is worthless, and should be repealed or amended.”’ . 
7 LANGUAGE OF THE SCHOOLS, 
‘«The law should specify definitely in what language’ the instruction in our public 
schools is tobe given. It isa shame anda disgrace to American institutions to have | — 
the English language ruled out of our public schools and German substituted, as is done 
wholly or in part in many districts in this State. The average legislator appears to 
quake when this matter is brought up for consideration. Right and justice are forgot- 
ten or smothered, for the sake of the German yote. Noreasonable argument can be ad- 
duced why German should be taught in any primary schools. Representatives and 
senators admit that German can be put out of a public school by an injunction served 
upon the board; but why shall a citizen be compelled to resort to the ‘courts to secure 
that which should be provided by legislative enactment? Men have said to me, ‘ You 
should not agitate this question; it is impolitic to inaugurate a fight along that line.? aides 
My purpose in bringing this matter to the attention of the public, and before our leg- * 
islature, is that justice may be administered to the citizen, and the children be taught 
to speak, read, and write the English language. The same spirit that deprives the chil- 
dren of any community of the benefits of instruction in the English language would, if 
it dare, subyert the very foundations of this Government and subject our children to a 
thraldom and tyranny as despotic as that from which many of these innovators emi- 
grated, only 'to try to bind the shackles upon others that dhey themselves could not 
endure. 
“This is not a fight against: Cerntaite but against hb introduction of the German lan- | 
guage into our primaryschools. This wrong will not much longer be tolerated; it should 
not be, for where it now is practiced there is an alarming state of affairs; law is disre- 
garded, our institutions derided, and all that is held sacred ruthlessly trodden under 
foot; and nothing else can be expected of such a community.’’ i

_ EDUCATION REPORT, 188 ee s 7 
_. SECTARTANISM. 
“Your attention is again called to the fact that in many localities in this State that 
provision of our constitution which prohibits the use of public funds to build up and 
foster sectarianism is violated with high-handed recklessness. Here again, allow me to 
speak plainly; it is not my purpose to conceal my true meaning; all the trouble from 
this quarter has arisen in Catholic communities, where they have control. Insuchcom- © 
munities the tenets of the church and the study of the catechism are made part of the 
daily instruction in the public school; and in more than one community the priest 
openly dictates who shall and who shall not teach the public school ofsuch community. 
The State constitution is plain upon this subject; but it needs proper iegislation to en- 
force its provisions, and not compel the citizens to have to resort to law to secure their 
rights.’’ 
< SUPERVISION. ‘a ¥ 
A great mistake was made in the revision of the school law in not providing for a 
county superintendent for such county. The legislature was opposed to this; it, how- 
ever, passed a measure providing for county supervision for all those counties which 
may vote to adopt it. 
TEACHERS. 
; 
Many of the teachers employed in the rural districts are thoroughly competent and 
successful in. their work, but there are others who are sadly deficient. The county 
_ teachers’ institutes are doing much to improve the qualifications of teachers, but the 
normal schools especially are sending out many excellent teachers, who are exemplars 
of enthusiasm, tact, and skill to other teachers. 
| SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
More school buildings were erected during the year than ever before. They were also 
larger and better buildings. The value of school property increased during the year 
more than $1,000,000, making a total value of school property at the present time of 
nearly $11,000,000. Many of the schoolhouses in rural districts are too small to accom- 
modate the children of the districts. Many of them are not fenced in, and some are not 
even locked at night. They are also used for other than school purposes, such as meet- 
ings of societies, clubs, ete. The schoolhouses are frequently very much injured on 
such occasions. No one feels responsible for the condition of the schoolhouses. The 
school boards expect the teachers to attend to them, and the teachers expect the school 
boards to do so, The condition of the water-closets is often disgraceful. If a teacher 
has no regard for the hygienic surroundings of his pupils he should not be allowed’ to 
have charge of them. E ¢ 
HIGH SCHOOLS, 
» Twenty-seven cities and towns have high schools with a course of four years, thirty- 
eight with a course of three years, and sixty-five with a course of two years. Nearly 
~ all of these are in an excellent condition. Their success depends to a large extent upon 
the school'boards. If the board is always anxious to economize by securing the cheap- 
est teachers and having a short term, the schoois will not meet with that success which 
should attend them. ‘In some of the high schools which have courses of three or four 
years, where there are only three or four pupils in the last year’s course it would be ad- 
visable to shorten the course by one year. 
oy THANKSGIVING DONATION, 
In November, 1888, the superintendent of public instruction sent out circulars to the 
schools asking them to observe Thanksgiving Day by making donations to the needy 
children, so that they might be provided with the necessary books and clothing for at- 
tending school. The experiment was so entirely successful that it was repeated in No- 
vember, 1889, and many a child went home with a smiling face and a happy heart on 
" aceount of the present it had received, while the contributors fully realized the truth of 
the expression that ‘‘it is more blessed to give than to receive.”

The superintendent of public instruction says that he is constantly receiving letters 
from all parts of the State for information relating to sales and leases of the school 
Jands. He also states that depredations are continually being made upon these lands, 
and that it will reauire close oversight to prevent them. 
He suggests that county superintendents, besides being required to compile the re- 
ports of district trustees and clerks, should also be required to report upon the general 
work of the schools, the condition of the buiidings, fences, furniture, etc.

The number of pupils enrolled, Superintendent Patterson says, ‘‘is 1,652 less than 
the number enrolled last year. This does not include the number enrolled for a less 
’ time than two weeks; but, as it stands, it would seem to indicate a rapid falling off of the © 
school population of the State. But when we take into account the large numbers who 
have been taken from the public and put into private parochial schools from which we 
have no returns, we see that the above decrease of the enrollment indicates no falling 
off in the school population of the State, though it must decrease the average attend- 
ance of all the schools and to each school. 
‘Again, the tables show an increase of $35,691.10 over the total revenue raised last 
year, but as fifteen new schoolhouses have been built during the period which cost 
$63,317.91 we can see there has been a large falling off in the amount raised for the 
support of schools, as we had reason to fear there would be under the appraisal of 1885. 
It will be observed from. the summary that the total expenditures of the last year ex- 
ceeded the total income by $26,641.92. This excess came from the money hired for 
building purposes and from the surplus of the previous year. ‘ . 
f “The number of small schools under the town system is still decreasing, The last - 
year twenty-one were dropped. As a consequence the number of graded schoolsis in- 
creased sixteen and the number of high schools two.’’ 
The apportionment of 1885 decreased the amount of the echool tax in 162 towns. 
This curtailment of school revenues has deprived the schools of needed supplies and 
improvements and necessitated the employment of cheaper teachers or a shortening of 
the school terms. 
Complaint is made that insome towns ‘‘men have been placed upon the [school] 
board and sworn to a discharge of its duties, whose inexperience, lack of interest, or 
want of early opportunities have left them utterly disqualified for such work,’ Asa 
consequence the schools and the intelligence and the standing of these communities have’ 
suffered damage.’’? ‘To remedy this the State superintendent suggests the appointment

The whole number of children in the State between 5 and 18 years of age is 399,052, 
_ an increase of 2.9 per cent. over the census of the preceding year; the increase béing 
largest in Passaic, Hudson, and Camden Counties. The increase in the cities was 5.4 
percent. The number of children 5 to 18 years of age enrolled in the public schools 
was 227,441, which is an increase in the whole number attending, but a decrease of 2 
per cent. when the greater number of census children is considered. ‘There is a constant 
- annual decrease in the proportion of census children attending the public schools, but 
those who do attend do so for a longer time each year. In order to receive any portion 
of the public funds the schools must be kept open nine months. Nearly all the schools 
were kept open longer than that; the average term for the State being nine months and 
twelve days. Only one school in the State was kept open less than six months. 
As the successful work of the schools depends so much on the punctuality and regu- 
larity of attendance of pupils, a record has been kept of these particulars and is presented 
in tabular form in the report. It shows that the average enrollment in each schoolroom 
? t

“was 38, and the average daily attendance in each room was 31. If the cities are con- 
sidered by themselves a better presentation can be made, for out of an average enroll- 
ment of 42 the number absent was only 6. In the matter of tardiness there was a little 
more than one case daily in the State, and a little less than one case daily in the cities, 
if considered by themselves. f ” 
TEACHERS. 5 ‘ 
Although there was an increase over the previous year of only 1} per cent. in the 
number of children enrolled, there were 178 more teachers, 6 men and 172, women. 
The State superintendent endeavored to reduce the number of teachers confining them- 
selves closely to text-books and to reduce the number of daily recitations, It is thought 
that some improvement has been made in these respects. The average number of reci- 
tations heard daily is fifteen. 
In regard to the experience of teachers New Jersey makes a favorable showing com- 
pared with other States. The average time taught by each teacher in the same school 
is 4 years and 6 months; butif the cities are considered by themselves the average time 
is 7 years and 9 months. The average total experience of all the teachers of the State 
is 8 years; the average experience of the city teachers, 10 years and 2 months. County 
and city superintendents have been faithful in their efforts to improve the qualifications’ 
of teachers, and the teachers themselves have been active in this direction. New Jer- 
sey long ago prohibited corporal punishment in the schools, and the 22 years of expe- 
‘ rience without it abundantly justify its disuse. Other improvements have followed 
gradually, until now the methods of teaching have reached a high degree of excellence. 
1 
SCHOOLHOUSES AND SUPPLIES, 
Thirty-two schoolhouses have been built during the year, five of them replacing old 
houses no longer fit to use. Others have been enlarged, and quite a number repaired 
and remodeled. The school property of the State is now valued at $8,300,610, Much 
more attention is now given to the proper lighting, heating, and ventilating of school- 
houses. The appropriation allowed the State department of education for furnishing 
plans and specifications of schoolhouses was not sufficient to supply one-half of the de- 
mand. Of the 2,642 schoolhouses in the State, 105 are reported ‘‘poor’’ and 69 as 
‘*very poor.’’ It is probable, however, that the standards of classification have been 
been raised, and that what would have been classed ‘‘ poor”’ schoolhouses a few years ago 
are now classed ‘‘ very poor.’’ 
In some of the cities, especially those increasing most rapidly in population, there is 
a lack of sufficient school accommodations. While their census population has increased 
about 6 per cent., the school accommodations have increased only about 4 percent. As 
a result, we find the schoolrooms overcrowded, ‘‘If we fix the highest number of pupils 
that should be cared for in one room as 80—a very liberal standard—then we have 64 
rooms that are overcrowded; one more than the number reported last year.’? Nineteen 
rooms were each made to accommodate.more than 100 children. 
There is a constant improvement in the schools as regards furniture and supplies, but 
there are still 231 schoolhouses furnished with the old-fashioned desks made of pine- 
boards. Blackboards are needed in 262 schools and maps in 217. More than one-half 
the schools are supplied with libraries, and about one-third of the pupils are supplied 
with free text-books. 
EVENING SCHOOLS. 
These schools have been kept open 938 evenings; the number of pupils enrolled was 
8,934, the average attendance each evening 4,272, the number of teachers 214, and the 
total appropriation for them was $23,964. ‘i 
REVENUES, 
On, account of the increased population of school age, the amount raised by the State 
tax for the support of schools was larger by $68,180 than in the previous year. The 
whole amount, together with the $100,000 from the invested school fund, was a little 
more tan $1,900,000. Although there was an increase in the amount raised for teachers’ 
salaries by city and district taxes, the number of districts that taxed themselves for 
this purpese decreased to 280, about 23 per cent. of the districts in the State.

| NEW MEXICO, t i y ? 
Complete and reliable school statistics of this Territory are not yet to be obtained; 
_ those given in chapter 22 are the best approximations that can be made. They are sufs 
ficient, however, to show that public schools have been making rapid strides since 1880, 
the yearly increase of enrollment for eight years having averaged about 17 per cent. 
The average number of public-school pupils to every 100 persons has increased since 
1880 from 4to 11. This latter number, however, is still only about one-half the aver- 
age number for the country at large. (See table 3, column 6.) The expenditure for 
public schools is about one dollar, per capita of the population, which also is about one- 
half that of the country at large. 4 
There is no indication that the average growth of the past eight years is being con- 
tinued, though there is doubtless a gradual and continuous improvement. Definite 
statistical information is much needed. Ff 
3 The compulsory attendance law of 1887 is defective in its wording, so that it can not 
be enforced, as it does not ‘‘compel anything or anybody.’’ Even if this were not the 
case it would be largely inoperative through the indifference of the public and the prac- 
tical difficulties in the way of its execution. It may have had some indirect beneficial 
effect. 9 /\ ' / ' t 
Of the 344 public schools in the Territory 143 are taught in English, 106 in Spanish, 
~ and 95 in both languages. The Spanish-speaking people are generally ‘‘very anxious 
to have their children'taught English.” 3: 
: " ‘PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF NEW MEXICO. / 
The following is taken from a report made by Mr. T. B. Mills, United States Treas- 
ury expert, to the Bureau of Statistics: 
_ The introduction and establishment of a system of public education for the children 
of New Mexico has been rather a slow and difficult process. There have been and are 
yet many causes which have retarded and still prevent a proper growth and develop- 
ment of public free schools. Among these may be mentioned the sparseness of popula- 
- » tion in grazing districts, where often the residence of one family is miles distant from 
any other, but the principal causes are a deep-rooted prej adice of an influential part of 
the population against the system of education and Jack of training and understanding 
of its practical working by the people themselves and the district officers chosen to 
carry out the provisions of the laws. The best public-school laws in the world (which 
wo have not) would be found to be inefficient and unsatisfactory when applied to a pop- 
ulation unaccustomed to such a system. The successful execution of school laws de- 
_ pends so largely upon the people themselves, upon minor precinct officers, that the lat- 
. ter are very liable to misapprehend their duties and the scope of their powers and privi- 
leges unless they have had previous training and experience. Their acts of commission * 
and omission may all be well intended, but they often fail to put schools in practical 
operation. It takes time. The children are not the only ones to be taught; the voting 
and governing population outside of the schoolroom have to learn the requirements of 
the law and the manner to enforce it to secure the best results. It takes a population 
educated under a public-school system to successfully eilbies and administer public- 
school laws. { 
‘But lack of experience may be overcome by interested effort, and Iam glad to say 
that there is a large portion of the population of New “Mexico, enthusiastic in the sup- 
' port of public schools and popular education. They are anxious that their children 
shall learn, The English language is also steadily growing in favor. Necessarily the 
instruction in the schools of New Mexico has been largely in the Spanish language, but 
English is now taught wherever at all practicable. i 4) 
_ ‘The general establishment of public schools throughout the Territory dates from 
the school law of 1884. It is not particularly a good law or a complete and perfect one 
by any means, but it ‘introduced two new features which were not embraced in previous 
legislation and which secured the general establishment of schools. These were the 
provisions creating the office of county superintendent and the election by the people 
of a board of three directors or commissioners for each precinct. The system was a new 
“one, and, fortunately for the great majority of counties, the first election resulted in the 
choice of competent and qualified men, who had nearly all been educated under the 
public schools of the States, p the offices of school superintendents. * * * 
“The law was general in ternis without specific provisions, but the superintendents 
_ found sufficient authority to organize one or more public schools in almost every pre- 
. \ cinct throughout the Territory, and they have ever since been fairly well maintained. 
The system is now firmly established and is growing constantly in public favor. ‘The ae é ' ‘

school fund is provided by a tax of one-fourth of 1 per cent. on all the taxable property 
ofthe Territory. The poll tax and certain fines are also turned into the school fund. 
“The first law relating to schools in New Mexico was passed January 23,1860. By) 
this law the justice of the peace in each precinct was to appoint the teacher and he was: 
entitled to collect:the sum of fifty cents per month for each child attending his school. 
Compulsory attendance of children was also provided for. ’ 
‘On the 23d of January,1863, another.law was passed creating a board of education, 
consisting of the governor, secretary, the judges of the supreme court, and the bishop 
(Catholic) of New Mexico. This board was invested with extraordinary powers, ‘to 
make all laws, rules, and regulations necessary for the education of all the children 
within the limits of this Territory.’ They were not, however, provided with any cer- 
tain fund raised by taxation, but ‘all funds or moneys derived from the Government 
of the United States, from Territorial appropriations, or from any other source intended 
for public school purposes,’ should be devoted exclusively to the cause of education. 
But as the funds ‘intended for public schools’ came in rather slowly this distinguished 
board with its ample grant of powers was not able to accomplish much in the direction 
of the education of youth. 
“The legislature of 1872, however, made a decided advance in providing for public 
education. By the laws passed at that session a school fund was created by a levy of 
one-fourth of 1 per cent. on all the taxable property of the Territory, and instead of 
the Territorial board county boards of school directors or supervisors were created. 
These boards consisted of four persons, elected by the people of each county, and tie 
_ probate judge. Under this law a number of public schools were established and fairly 
paved the way for the better system of 1884. : 
‘By this last law, as before noted (the law of 1884), the county board of school super- 
visors was superseded by the boards of precinct directors and a county superintendent. | 
This last system has, created a lively interest in school matters among the common peo- 
ple and has yielded the best results. 
“<A comprehensive measure for public schools was before the last legislature (1889), 
and was ably championed by W. D. Kistler, representative from this (San Miguel) 
county, and editor of ithe Daily Optic, and the Territorial press generally, but from 
various causes it was finally defeated.’’

THE TEACHING SERVICE,    
  h i 
New York has increased her expenditure for public-school work from $3,700,000 in 
1860 to over $16,000,000 in 1889. A consideration of this enormous increase of expendi- 
ture suggests the inquiry whether the schoolsare deriving all due profit from it. Ifthe 
schools of the State come short of doing as excellent work as is done by the best Euro- 
pean schools of similar grade, it is owing to laxness in conferring authority to teach, to 
indifferent training of teachers, and to the ill-usage which is put upon them, } 
Permanency in position is.a prerequisite to the best results in schoolroom work. Yet 
out of 10,644 rural districts more than half of them had teachers who had not taught 
in the same districts the preceding term. More than 75 per cent. had not been a year 
in their present situations. During the year 3,251 teachers received their first certifi- 
cates in the rural districts. Good school work can not be expected if the teacher is — 
turned out of office whenever the trustee changes, or if his training has not been such 
as to put heart and soul into his work, or if he is not directed by and responsible only 
to competent authority. t 
New York State is leading the way to remedy the evils which stand in the way of a 
most substantial and professional teaching service. All her legislation, all the power 
of her State educational department, all the influence of her leading educators and edu- 
cational journals have been in the direction of greater caution in the selection of teach- 
ers, more thorough and intelligent professional training, more permanent tenure of of- 
fice, and better treatment for honest and competent work. 
i SCHOOL PROPERTY. ; 
The legislation of recent years touching the improvement of school buildings and 
furnishings, supplemented by the publication by the State of schoolhouse designs, has 
led to the erection of an unprecedented number of newand handsome buildings and to 
the thorough repair and refurnishing of many old ones. 
During the past year the public moneys were withheld from all districts until they - 
vwere certified by supervisory officers to have complied with the provisions of the law 
. eoncerning the number, arrangement, and character of the outbuildings connected with 
each schoolhouse, 
ARBOR DAY, 
The celebration of Arbor Day was generally observed in New York the first time Fri- 
day, May 3, 1889. The reports concerning the observance of the day indicate that the 
movement was heartily approved by teachers, school officers, pupils, and the general 
public. In some localities all other business was suspended for the day, the inhabitants 
vying with each other in making the exercises pleasant and profitable. Outside of the 
cities, 5,681 school districts reported as having observed the day, planting 24,166 trees, 
not including vines, shrubs, and flowers. | 
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE LAW. 
_ The compulsory education act of 1874 having failed hitherto to remedy the evils which 
_ Jed to its enactment, a new measure was prepared with great care, in which were em- 
bodied the principles which experience has shown to be essential in order to make any 
compulsory law effective. This measure passed the legislature, but failed to become a 
law for want of the approval of the governor. It will probably be amended and rein- 
troduced the next ensuing session. 
  COURSES OF STUDY IN UNGRADED. SCHOOLS, 
The great difficulty which the ungraded rural. schools have always encountered has 
been the entire absence of any fixed and orderly system of procedure. During the last 
year there has been a very decided movement towards mending the difficulty by pro- 
viding a course of study for the ungraded schools, Two well-arranged courses have been 
put in operation, one in three counties, and the other has been approved and commended 
by twenty-two county school commissioners. Connected with these courses are systems 
of examination calculated to encourage continuous attendance, progressive study, and 
final graduation. ! 
Aes A STATE EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION PROPOSED. 
Superintendent Draper, calling attention to the heavy expenditure for public educa- 
tion and the lack of organized system and method in school work, renews his recom- 
mendation for a State commission in the interest of education, upon a plan analogous

to those of Great Britain and Mexico. He is inclined to believe that a body composed 
of perhaps thirty or forty persons, in which the legislature, the colleges, the normal 
schools, the high schools, the district schools,the boards of trustees, the superintendents 
and commissioners, and the best professional opinion should be represented, and which 
should remain in session thirty or sixty days, and discuss general principles for the 
promotion of educational interests, would result in astrong impetus to the prone and a 
permanent influence for good. 
  DIGESTS OF STATE SCHOOL REPORTS.    
NEW LEGISLATION. 
Expenses of superintendents.,—The State superintendent is to make no allotment of 
State funds to any city or district for the expenses of a superintendent unless satisfied 
that such city, village, or district employs a competent person as superintendent, whose 
time is exclusively devoted to the general supervision of the schools. 
Extension of school term.—The/minimum number of weeks the school of a district is 
to be kept open in order to entitle it to share in the State apportionment has been in- 
creased trom twenty-eight to thirty-two weeks, of five school days each. 
Contracts with teachers.—No trustee shall employ a teacher for a shorter time than six- 
teen weeks, unless for the purpose of filling out an unexpired term of school; nor shall 
any teacher be dismissed in the course of a term except for reasons which, if appealed’ 
to the State superintendent, shall be held sufficient. Any failure onthe part ofa teacker 
to complete an agreement to teach a term of school, without good reason therefor, shall 
be deemed sufficient ground for the revocation of the teacher’s certificate. \ 
Raising money for teachers’ wages,—No trustee shall issue an order or draw'a draft upon 
any supervisor for money for the payment of teachers’ wages, unless the supervisor 
has sufficient money in hand, to meet such order or draft. If there is no such money 
available, and the district meeting has failed to authorize atax to pay teachers’ wages, 
the school trustees of the district are authorized to collect by distriet tax a sufficient 
amount. 
Boards of education in union free school districts are authorized to levy a tax for teach- 
ers’ wages and ordinary contingent expenses in case the inhabitants have neglected or 
refused to vote the same.

t ‘ ORGANIZATION OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
Si Attention is called by the State superintendent to the waste that accompanies the 
carrying on of the school system, a waste which is nowhere more strikingly exhibited 
than in the ‘‘double-headed”’ system for township schools. The township and district 
boards, as the law now stands, are an obstruction to each other, and should be replaced 
  F by a single system, such as the cities and towns have. ‘‘This system would concentrate 
vf responsibility, which is now scattered and evasive. It would tend to, unify courses of 
ee study and introduce better methods of instruction. Under it the adjustment of the 
Fs number of schools to the wants of the school population would become more easy and _ 
uniform. It would, also, be likely to’create in the public mind a sharper distinction 
between good and poor teaching. Above all, it moni promote economy in the man- 
agement of the schools.’’   COMPULSORY EDUCATION, 
Amore stringent compulsory education law was enacted at the last session of the 
legislature, an account of which is reserved for another part of this Report. 
. SUPERVISION NEEDED FOR COUNTRY SCHOOLS. 1 
  ‘‘The ungraded country district schools, in which one-half our youth are to get all 
the school education that will fall to their share, are the ones yet to feel the benefits of 
intelligent inspection and direction. A few townships in the State have arisen above 
5 the educational level of their neighbors, and have availed themselves of the permissive 
P25 features of the law, and have adopted township supervision, reaping from their intelli- 
gent enterprise a fruitful harvest of good results for their schools. But these townships 
in number are but as a drop in the bucket. 
“That Ohio has been so long without supervision for her country schools is a fact not 
to be easily accounted for. It certainly is not the result of indifference on the part of 
her educators. Within the last forty years they have pressed the question upon the 
attention of the legislature again and again. * * * Ohio can never have a school 
% system commensurate with her greatness as a State until she has placed her country 
patel? _ schools under intelligent supervision. Without this all schemes for the improvement 
- of these schools must prove but temporary expedients and fall short of their full meas- 
ure of usefulness,’? 
; CONTINUANCE OF SCHOOLS. 
f 
f ‘The law of Ohio provides that ‘‘each board of education shall establish a sufficient 
He number of schools to provide for the free education of the youth of school age within 
“ei the district under its conirol at such places as will be most convenient for the attend- 
7 ance of the largest number of such youth, and shall continue each and every day 
Bil school so established not less than 24 weeks in each school year. ‘This is a very impor-

tant provision of the law, yet it is not complied with by all township boards.” In 
1888-89 there were 30 counties having 80 delinquent townships, with 170 delinquent 
subdistricts. Of the 80 delinquent townships but 15 taxed up to the limit of the law. 
‘Where the township taxes up to the lawful limit no blame can attach to the township 
board, for it has done all that.the law permits it todo. But where boards fail to im- 
pose such a rate of taxation within the limits of the law as will produce a sum sufficient 
to continue all the schools of the township 24 weeks, such boards fail to discharge a 
sworn duty. Yet, in the year 1887-88, 12 townships in 1 county failed to provide 24 
weeks of school for all the subdistricts of the townships, and but 1 of these townships 
levied up to 7 mills, and 3 of thet levied a tax less than 2 mills.”’

‘«There has been a very large increase in the number of graded schools during the 
year, viz, 566. _The whole number of graded schools is now 10,117, nearly one-half 
of all ourschools. This rapid increase of graded schools demands most careful watch- 
fulness upon the part of superintendents and teachers. While we have the great gain 
derived from such division of labor as the graded school secures, we must seek to 
avoid the serious dangers involved. Teachers confined to one line of studies, and those 
that are suited only to a certain age, are apt to take into view only the small séction of 
child's life belonging to that age, and this weakens the great incentive to work which 
comes from the clear vision of the end of education in the beginning. The end is not | 
the examination for promotion to another grade. The solid culture of the child toward 
a well-furnished personality—a developed, intelligent life of thought and act—must be 
the main aim of all teaching, and this should not be broken ‘in upon by any interrup- 
tion of artificial grades. Hence great caution is required in graded schools, lest, through 
anxiety to promote from grade to grade, the child be fitted more for examination than 
for life. 
‘The increase in the salary of teachers has been very small. Now that the amount 
appropriated by the State is two millions—double what it was four years ago—it is to 
be hoped that the average salary of teachers will be greatly enlarged. It is now, for 
male teachers, only thirty-nine dollars per month, and for female teachers only a little 
over thirty dolars.. This want ofproper remuneration isinjuring thestatus of ourschools. 
It is retarding the whole educational work of the State, and every exertion should be 
made to remedy this defect. Direct legislation can effect but little. Public sentiment 
must bearoused. Directorsand parents must realize the vast importance of our schools 
and the great responsibility of our teachers, and refuse to make the matter of selecting 
them nothing more than the employment Of the cheapest candidates in the market, Our 
superintendents also must make the provisional certificates fewer and fewer, demanding 
higher grades and insisting on more thorough examinations. By concerted action the 
way may be opened fora better condition of affairs as regards salaries and tenure of 
office. 
“‘While thankful for the legislation secured in behalf of the schools, we regret very 
much that the bill fora closer supervision of our schools in rural districts failed of passage. 
Closer supervision is so necessary that it must soon come. ‘The need of it becomes more 
arpa every day, and very many directors are only waiting for authority to organize 
the work, , i :

The general condition of the schools does not change very materially in any one year, 
but what changes are made are in the line of still further progress and development. 
‘There are several considerations which lead one to believe that the publicschoolsare doing 
more successful work than formerly. That the people highly appreciate the education 
their children receive at the public schools is evidenced by the constantly recurring 
votes of towns and districts for the erection of school buildings and by the numerous 
demands for the establishment of high schools. That the character of the instruction 
_given in the public schools has improved may be inferred from the fact that a larger 
“ proportion of the teachers are Brae tes of high sehools, academies, and especially nor- 
mal schools. 
ATTENDANCE, 
The school census shows a slight i increase in’ school population, but the increase in the 
number of chiidren' attending public and private schools was three timesas great. The 
great difficulty encountered, however, is the irregularity of attendance; it is the constant 
complaint of school committees. But there seems to be no available remedy for it 
unless parents can be made to fully realize and appreciate the benefits of education. 
The compulsory law can secure the attendance of children for a specified term, but it 
can not eradicate the evil of irregularity. ‘*‘The number of children between the ages 
_ of Tand 15, or those over whom the compulsory law is especially extended, was reduced 
“449, or nearly 10 per cont., while the number of those who attended less than 12 weeks, 
the minimum time fixed by Jaw, was reduced nearly 26 per cent.”? This shows that
-P-A-G-E-79
     TAL 
  DIGESTS OF STATE SCHOOL REPORTS. 
Jaws for compulsory attendance are meeting with good success. In some of the towns 
they are much more strictly enforced than in others. In Pawtucket, Woonsocket, New- 
port, South Kingston, and East Greenwich the enforcement of the law is found to be 
simple and feasible. There is no reason why it should not be as thoroughly enforced in 
the city of Providence. In many of the rural districts it is rarely necessary to resort to 
extreme measures; the siniple fact that there is an officer to secure the attendance of 
children at school acconfplishes the purpose. While a large number of cases of truancy 
are reported as having been investigated, only eleven were convicted. The length of 
time during which it is required that all pupils shall attend the public schoals is only 
twelve weeks. Itshould probably be twenty weeks. It seems that all children between 
seven and twelve years of age, the most suitable years for them to acquire an education, _ 
should be attending school for more than the short period of twelve weeks. Sufficient 
progress can not be made in so short atime. Again, in most of the schools promotions 
are made twice a year, so that the classes are half a year apart, and, if attendance were 
required for twenty weeks, all the children would attend long enough to complete one 
grade each year. 
SIZE OF SCHOOLS. 
The number of small ungraded schools is constantly increasing. Fifty-four schools 
were reported as having less than ten pupils each, and some of them were so small that 
they scarcely deserved to be called schools. Much better results can be secured in large 
graded schools. It would be better to incur the expense of conveying children to alarge 
school rather than to pay the salaries of teachers of such small schools. 
ACCOMMODATIONS. 
By comparing the number of sittings reported by the towns and districts with the 
school population it is found that there are accommodations for 94 per cent. of the chil- 
dren needing them. In many of the country towns there are more sittings than are 
needed, but in the manufacturing communities there is not a sufficient number. It is 
in these communities, too, that the compulsory law is most poorly enforced, and the 
children are not expected to attend the whole year. Thereis very little occasion, there- 
fore, for any child to remain away from school on account of the want of accommoda- 
tion. In those towns where there has been a deficiency in school accommodations pro- 
vision is being made to supply the want by erecting large, well-planned, and EPR OAt : 
buildings. 
TEACHERS AND WAGES. 
Heretofore the number of male teachers has been constantly diminishing, but during 
the last year the number has increased by one. It is very desirable that the number 
of male teachers shall be still further increased, for, however succeysful women may be 
as teachers, it is not well.that men should be entirely excluded. A larger number of 
the teachers were graduates of normal schools, high schools, and academies; it is there- 
fore to be inferred that the work was well done. The number of pupils to a teacher was 
the same as in the previous year—thirty-three. 
The salaries of teachers run higher than in the preceding year, men receiving $1.07 
more per month, and women 80 cents. The salaries of all the teachers are still lower 
than they should be, but especially is this true of teachers’ salaries in the village gram- 
mar schools. 
SUPERVISION, 
The whole amount expended for school purposes was over $900,000, but the amount 
paid out for supervision of schools was $18,606, or a trifle over 2 per cent. of the whole 
amount expended. A large part of the supervision which schools receive is furnished 
without any compensation ,whatever, and without this voluntary supervision many of 
the schools would utterly fail. The State should not ask men to take this time away 
from their own affairs and to giveit tothe public. Moreover, the schools deserve more 
attention than they have heretofore received. 
Each city and town is allowed to make its own regulations for determining the qualifi- 
cations of its teachers; consequently, there is no uniformity,in the requirements at all. 
Some of the cities require very high attainments, while others are very lax. Ail teachers 
in the State should be required to attain toa certain minimum standard of education, 
‘and cities should be allowed, to require a standard as muchjhigher,as they see fit: ab

‘ ‘ EY DISTRICT SYSTEM. } ‘ : 
The board of education renews its former recommendation, hich was also jndbraa by 
. the governor in his message to the legislature, that steps be taken to secure the abolish- 
ment of school districts. All the school officers of the State, : re well as every State super- 
intendent in New England, speak in favor of this change.   
PUBLIC LIBRARIES. | 
There are 38 free public libraries containining 152,390 volumes, an increase of 8,121 
over last year. Of course a large proportion of the books read are fictitious works, but 
there was a slight increase in the number of historical and educational works read. It 
is very important that good librarians should be secured so that they may know what 
Kinds of hooks to recommend to the different classes of readers in order that they may 
be gradually interested in instructive works. 
1 
DRAWING. 
There is a strong disposition now on the part of young men to enter upon mechanical © 
, pursuits rather than agricultural. - The instruction given in the schools should always 
have a wise reference to the future work of the pupils in order that they may be well 
qualified to discharge their duties.. For this reason the board of education consider it 
yery important that drawing shall be taught in the schools, some skill in drawing being 
essential to successful industrial work. | 
SCHOOL APPARATUS, 
7 ‘i i 
The amount expended for school apparatus and books of reference was $1,319.16> 
Many books of reference in history, biography, and travels were purchased, and, as 
music is now so generally taught in the schools, better facilities for its instruction have 
been provided. Many valuable aids for the study of natural history have also been 
provided. ‘'One of the most noticeable features of late il ements in this line is the 
variety of material provided for use in the primary school. ‘Busy Work’ has won for 
itself a prominent place in all of our better primary schools, and the problem now is 
no longer how to keep the children still, but how to keep them busy.”” 
MORAL TRAINING. 
Much is being said at the present time about the lack of moral training in the public 
schools. However thorough may be the instruction given, if the schools fail to impress 
the children with the full “jmportance of virtueus principles they have fallen short of 
their proper work. It is quite probable, however, that the fault does not attach to the 
schools, but to the homes and the environments of the pupils. . 
PRIMARY EDUCATION. i 
A great change is taking place in the methods of instruction in the primary schools. 
It is no longer thought proper to place from 75 to Aven iors in the care of one teacher. 
' It is no longer thought that we can judge of the success of a teacher by the degree of 
quiet which she is able to secure, Life, movement, animation now characterize the 
successful primary schools. } |

GENERAL LOCAL TAX BILL, 
After many years of vain effort a general local tax bill has been enacted by the gen- ‘ 
eral assembly, and was approved by the governor December 24, 1888. It will no longer 
be necessary for the people of any school district desiring to provide a fund supple- 
mentary to the State fund to get the special authorization of the general assembly; but 
the voters of any school district who return real or personal property for taxation to the 
amount of $100 may levy a local tax not exceeding two mills and appropriate the same 
to such school purposes as they may see fit. 
Any city, incorporated town, or village desiring to establish a system: of graded or 
other public schools is constituted a,separate school district. 
Each taxpayer may have the tax paid under this act applied to any school in his dis- ‘ trict he may designate. Where no designation is made the money will be expended as “ other school funds in such district. © oe 
The new local tax law will prove of inestimable benefit, though the tax is too small 
for country schools. Some districts have been put in operation under the new law, but Woe the pou raised by the tax is not sufficient to give the schools the length of term re- 
quired. , 
_ The most urgent need of the school system in South Carolina is illustration, the prac. 405) tice of its principles in every community. i t

EDUCATION REPOR', 1888-8 A i ‘ ayes 
TOWN SCHOOLS, 
The public schools steadily gain ground. In the towns the system of graded schools 
is being gradually adopted. Sumter, Darlington, and York, three of the largest centers 
of influence in this State, held during the year their first session under this plan.. At 
no distant day every important place is expected to follow their lead. 
‘The people of South Carolina are intensely conservative, They have been watching 
with a jealous eye the development. of the new educational ideas and refuse to‘ move 
until the success of a scheme has been thoroughly demonstrated. This has been done 
so fully that the business men are now leaders in the movement for a more complete 
system of public schools. Already splendid schools have been established at Charles- 
ton, Columbia, Greenville, Spartanburg, Rock Hill, Winnsboreugh, Chester, Seneca, 
Johnston, Barnwell, Marion, Florence, Bennettsville, Camden, and other important 
places. These recommend themselves by their cheapness, their thoroughness, and 
the vital fact that they reach every child. It is simply a question of time, Superintend- 
‘ent Ricesays, when every town in the State that has real vitality and desires to educate 
the masses will have its graded school. 
COUNTRY SCHOOLS. 
The-country schools present more points of difficulty. Property is less valuable and 
the population sparse, being mainly an agricultural people. Free labor is unreliable 
and expensive, and the children are needed upon the farms a large part of the year. 
This, while it gives them a valuable practical training in the different branches of ag- 
riculture, necessitates brief school terms. If a ten months’ free graded school were 
located in every community very many could not use it more than six months. Asa 
rule they use their opportunities well; and the school term in all cases may be made to 
extend to six months by the application of the new general local tax act. 
The point requiring closest attention is the character of the work done during these 
short terms. Of the State system itself, the superintendent says: ‘‘After years of study 
of its provisions and contact with its operation and agencies in every part of the State, 
I say, with emphasis, that its principles are simple, wise, and strong.’’? ‘The trouble is 
‘that it has not been administered with fidelity. The great ery is for money; but if the 
school work is well done in the short terms and the money honestly applied the people 
will raise every dollar necessary. There is already great progress in many country 
school districts. They will compare favorably with the towns in the character of their 
schoolhouses, their equipment, length of session, competency of teachers, and vital 
connection on the part of parents with the administration of school affairs. There has 
been a large increase in the number and value of school buildings owned by the State. 
In some counties 2 good schoolhouse may be found in ove locality. 
PEABODY FUND AID TO GRADED SCHOOLS. 
= i 
South Carolina has received a larger amount from this fund during the last year than 
any other Southern State. This has resulted in aid being given to graded schools, The 
total amount appropriated to graded schools from this source was $4,450, of which 
Charleston received $1,000 and Greenville $850. Every one of these schools is suecess- 
fully conducted, and furnishes to the community in which it is situated the very best 
practical evidence of its‘adaptability to educate people. These schools receive assistance 
three years under certain conditions. At the close of their three-year terms the towns 
are taxing themselves for better buildings and more thorough equipment. A detailed 
account of the operations of these various schools, their cost, their ability to handle 
large numbers, and to train children thoroughly, will astonish and delight every friend 
of learning.

@ A few counties not reporting are estimated. 
Superintendent Smith states that his report was published later than it should have 
been on account of his not having received fnll returns. 
The salaries of county superintendents are so small that competent men refuse to ac- 
cept the place, or if they do accept it they do not give proper attention to the work. 
Again, it seems impossible tosecure prompt and full reports from the district clerks and 
county trustees, The remedy suggested is that county superintendents be paid liberal 
salaries and be vested with the power of approving warrants. 
As only about two-thirds of the school population are enrolled in the schools it would 
seem that the education of a large proportion of the children is being neglected. But 
other things should be considered in this connection. The scholastic population em- 
braces all. persons between the ages of six and twenty-one, but. many pareats do not 
send their children to school until they are seven years uf age, and many. boys and girls complete the course of the public schools by the time they are fifteen. Some allowance 
should also be made for the number attending private schools,

Under the act of Congress of March 3, 1887, the office of ‘Territorial superintendent of 
‘district schools created by the laws of Utah was abolished, and it was made the duty 
of the supreme court of the Territory to appoint a commissioner of schools, who should 
possess and exercise all the powers and duties previously imposed upon the Territorial 
‘superintendent by the laws of the Territory, and who should report annually to Con- 
Tess. 
* e An ‘examination of the reports of the commissioner of ESE and of the’ governor of: 
4 the Territory reveals the fact that the public-school system of Utah falls far short of 
what it should be, that not more than one-half the children in the Territory attend 
them, and that not more than one-half of the expenses of the public schools are paid 
» from public funds, the remaining half being raised by charges for tuition. 
The outlook for the future is equally discouraging, for the Mormon leaders, who exercise 
their influence over five-sixths of the people, are now beginning to establish church schools 
in each ‘‘stake”’ or church district. Since the passage of the law in 1887 which for- 
. bids the use in school of the Book of Mormon or any other sectarian book, their oppo- 
sition has become intensified. If any improvement is made in the public ee it 
must originate outside the Territory.

‘ DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. : ‘ 
Quite a number of denominational schools have been established in the Territory by 
the different sects in the United States. Of these the Presbyterians have 33; the Con- 
gregationalists, 24; Methodists, 21; Roman Catholics, 6; Episcopalians, 6; Lutherans, 
1; Baptists, 2; and Mormons, 6, The exact number of children attending these schools 
is not known, but it is estimated to be near 8,000. These schools, except those under 
Mormon control, would readily give place to a good system of common schools, con-' 
ducted by competent teachers; it is thought that if the common schools were made 
entirely free, and if they did good work, the Mormon schools also would have to yield 
before them. t 
SCHOOL LANDS. : 
The whole amount of land granted by Congress for the benefit of schools in the Ter- 
ritory is 46,080 acres; but as the value of these lands is much lowered on account of the 
scarcity of water, they are only worth about $1.25 per acre, or about $60,000 or $75,000 
as a whole.

NEW LEGISLATION, 
A new school law was enacted by the general assembly in 1888 and approved by the 
governor November 27, to take effect immediately. It had been drafted with great care 
by a board appointed especially to that end. 
‘The principal change was from town to county superintendency. i 
A new and more stringent system of examinations for teachers’ positions was adopted, 
the examinations to be simultaneous and uniform, and conducted by the county super- 
visors. 
Provision was made for an annual school census, giving the number of children of 
each year of age and the number of each year of age enrolled in the public schools. 
These facts are of prime importance in the study of any,school system. ‘ 
County uniformity of text-books was adopted, certain measures taken to equalize the 
revenues of the different districts of the several towns, the school year changed so as to 
end June 30, the school age changed from 6-20 to 6-18, and other alterations made.

The State superintendent points out some of the defects of the public schools of Vir- 
ginia, not for the purpose of showing that the system is unsatisfactory, but rather to 
make known in what respects he thinks the schools should and can, be improved. The 
average monthly salary of teachers, the average length of the school term, the average 
daily attendance per school, and the average cost of education per pupil have varied 
very little for several years. There has been for a number of years a gradual hut con- 
stant increase in the number of schools, enrollment, average daily attendance, number 
of teachers, and in the expenditures for school purposes. 
and 3,633 colored pupils supplied with text-books at public expense. 
COMPULSORY SCHOOL LAWS. 
It is to be regretted that the percentage of school population enrolled is so low, and 
especially that the average attendance is so small, In many of “the counties the school 
term is not longer than twenty weeks. ‘There is also great irregularity in the attend- There were 5,803 white pupils 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  DIGESTS OF STATE SCHOOL REPORTS. 749 
ance of pupils. The constitution of the State expressly permits the enactment of laws 
to prevent parents and guardians from ailowing their children to grow up in ignorance, 
When it is considered how much has been spent in the erection of school buildings, and 
how much is annually expended for the payment of teachers’ salaries and other educa- 
tional purposes, and when it is considered how far the social and economicai welfare of 
the State depends upon the education of its citizens, it seems but reasonable that some 
effort should be made to induce parents to grant their children the benefits of an edu- 
cation, Some authority will very probably be needed, because of the fact that educa- 
tion is least appreciated by those who stand in greatest need of it. So long, however, 
as public sentiment remains as it is, it would be difficult to enforce such a law. 
SCHOOL FUNDS, 
With the exception of a few hundred dollars, all the money expended for school pur- 
“poses is raised by taxation. ‘The whole amount was $62,456 more than in the previous 
year. Nearly one-half of the school funds was derived from levies made by cities, 
counties, and districts. There is great need of additional funds to lengthen the school 
term and to increase the salaries of teachers, for it can not be expected that teachers of 
a high order will be content with an annual salary of $150 or $175; but, on account of 
the financial difficulties of the State, it is impossible to increase the rate of taxation, 
especially in the rural communities. 
TEACHERS. 
There are many teachers in Virginia who will compare very favorably with those in 
any section of our country in all that constitutes an adequate moral and. intellectual 
equipment for the schoolroom. In intellectual force, in scholastic attainments, in 
general culture, in elevated personal character, in tact, energy, earnestness, and en- 
thusiasm, and in a clear comprehension of the great ends to be reached by education, 
there are many entitled to high rank. There are many who, at no inconsiderable sac- 
rifice, readily avail themselves of every means and every opportunity within their reach 
to improve themselves in their profession. But there is another class of teachers quite 
different from the one just described. Mary of them are incompetent and careless, and 
only think of the pay to be received. It would be well if a larger number of persons 
who had received a collegiate or higher education than that given in the public schools 
were employed. At present only 1,030 out of 7,423 teachers are graduates of incorpo- « 
rated institutions. A coilegiate education et broadens the mental horizon, gives higher 
ideals, elevates character, tone, and purpose.’’ To obtain the higher education, how- 
ever, requires several years of study and the outlay of considerable money. Those who 
have made these sacrifices can usually obtain positions paying much better salaries than 
those of teachers. 
As States become more thickly populated and their citizens better educated the pro- 
portion of female teachers increases. The delicate sensibilities and sympathetic nature 
of woman render her peculiarly fitted for taking charge of small children, and it is 
often found that she can discharge the duties of more responsible positions equally 
well, ‘ 
SUPERVISION. 
It is a recognized fact that in many of the schools the teachers are incompetent or 
inexperienced, that they are unacquainted with the new and improved methods, and 
that the children can not there acquire high ideals of school work. It is impossible to 
obtain a full supply of efficient and intelligent teachers under existing conditions. 
There are two normal schools for white teachers and two for colored teachers, but these 
can not at all supply the necessary number, even if they were entirely devoted to train- 
ing teachers for their special work. It is possible, however, to obtain a full supply of 
competent supervisors. Although some persons seem to regard the work of supervisors 
as of little advantage, there can be but little doubt that a capable, active, and skillful 
county or city superintendent can do much towards elevating and improving the schools 
in his charge. Itis very important that,he should have had some experience as a teacher 
himself. In counties where there are more schools than oné person can supervise, in- 
spectors might be appointed to visit a number of schools. 
PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE. 
It is recommended that instruction in physiology and hygiene he given in the schools, 
as it is very important that children should know something of the structure of. the 
human body, and how it can be kept in a condition of health and vigor. Many of the 
     
-P-A-G-E-88
  
    _ teachers employed at present a not be qualified to give such instruction, but if it 
were included among the subjects of examination they would soon become acquainted ~ 
with it. The spatecoiay should not be given entirely from 
COURSE OF STUDY. 
In some of the States there has been adopted a uniform plan for the organization and 
classification of ungraded schools, as well as a regular, systematic, and progressive course 
_ of studies for each grade. By this arrangement teachers can enter upon their work by 
a uniform plan, and there will be a continuous progression of pupils from year to year 
without regard to changes of teachers. 
ARBOR DAY. } 
In twenty-six States and Territories Arbor Day is now eters and in seven others 
the school officers will bring the subject to the attention of the legislatures. The observ- 
ance of such a day would be of great value in different ways. Many trees would be 
planted about schoolhouses and at the homes of pupils, children would be instructed as 
to what kinds of trees.it is best to plant and how to plant them; but, what is better, 
their attention would be called to the importance of ‘reserving forests and to the bene- 
fits to be derived from them, ’

In order to afford some idea of the educational progress made in Washington, Superin- 
tendent J. H. Morgan reports the statistics of different years from 1872 to 1889; but 
while it may be necessary to return to that year to secure sufficiently long steps or 
strides in educational data to satisfy enthusiasts of Washington, whose energies are 
bent upon securing a fortune in the time ordinarily spent in erecting a good school 
building, and who expect the school system to keep pace with the rapid material prog- 
ress of the newly-created State, it is only necessary to compare the statistics of 1887 
_ with those of 1889 to satisfy conservative citizens. Even then we find that some of the 
most important items have doubled, and others more thandoubled. In 1887 the whole 
amount spent for school purposes was, in round numbers, $300,000; in 1889 it was   ; f 
j Pa ‘ Ae see ak Le “sf a.  
-P-A-G-E-89
       
' pIGESTS OF STATE SCHOOL REPORTS. | 7513 
$600,000. In 1887 the value of the schoolhouses was $500,000; in 1889 it was $1,000,000. 
In the same time the number of children of school age increased from 47,000 to 72,000, 
the enrollment from 32,000 to 46,000. As the school population and enrollment are 
increasing so rapidly it is necessary that the other items show a corresponding increase; 
otherwise there would be a retrogression in the privileges of the individual pupils. As 
the public-school lands are now available, a large annual income may hereafter be ex- | 
pected from this source. i 2 
One difficulty heretofore has been to find a sufficient number of experienced and capa- 
ble teachers. Many of those who were qualified were making the position a mere step- 
ping stone to something better, while others were not qualified. ‘This difficulty is being 
rapidly overcome, however, as is shown by the report of many county superintendents 
that there was a scarcity of competent teachers in the early part of the year but that 
during the summer a great many arrived from the Eastern States. There are other ways . 
in which this scarcity can be overcome, as the requiring teachers to attend institutes, 
reading school journals, refusing to issue a third-grade certificate to a person the second 
time, forming teachers’ reading circles, and raising the standard of examinations. 
The county superintendents report that the law requiring the teaching of temperance ~ 
and hygiene is very fully and cheerfully complied with, but that the compulsory- 
attendance law has no effect whatever.

    REPORT. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, U. S. BUREAU or EpucaTion, 
OFFICE OF GENERAL AGENT OF EDUCATION, 
Sitka, Alaska, June 30, 1889, 
To the TERRITORIAL Boarp' or Epucation: 
Srrs: I have the honor of submitting the following report of the schools of Alaska 
for the year ending June 30, 1889: 
There are in the district of Alaska fourteen day schools supported wholly by the 
Government, four boarding schools aided by the Government, and a number of mission 
schools carried on by different religious organizations. 
From one of the public schools (Unga) no report has been received. The other 
thirteen report a total enrollment of 1,040 pupils, 
From two of the contract schools no reports haye been received. The other two re- 
~port a total enrollment of 195. 
No reports have been received from the mission schools. 
_ It is estimated that there are 1,500 children in the schools of Alaska, The total pop- 
ulation under twenty-one years of age is estimated at 12,000. 
GOVERNMENT DAY SCHOOLS, 
In the Unalaska district there is but one public school, that of Unga. 
This promising school has been without a teacher for the past year. 
‘On the 26th of May, 1888, Mr. W. A. Baker, of New Bethlehem, Pa., was appointed 
teacher at Unga. Oa the 30th of June, 1888,.Mr. Baker having declined to accept, Mr. 
John A. Tuck, of Middleton, Conn., was appointed in his place. By the time Pro- 
fessor Tuck received notice of his appointment it was too late to reach San Francisco 
in time'to take the last boat of the season for Unga. 
’ Kodiak district. 
In the Kodiak district are situated the two schools of Kodiak and Afognak. 
Kodiak.—W. E. Roscoe, teacher. Total enrollment, sixty-eight. The average at- 
tendance is much larger than the preceding year and with the more regular attendance 
has come an increased interest in their studies.on the part of the pupils. 
The school is graded in accordance with the California system. 
Professor Roscoe has availed himself of the preference of the children for the study 
of geography to combine with it lessons in language, writing, and spelling. 
Frequent talks are had concerning different countries, their natural phenomena, prod- 
ucts, people, customs, ete. 
Sentence building is carefully taught from the first to the fourth reader, and Hos im- 
provement in language is very rapid. ; 
Object and picture lessons are in daily use. Spelling down and recitations are occa- 
sional amusements. 
This school, like all the. others, greatly needs a set of good wall maps. 
It also needs a suitable school building, the erection of which has been recommended 
by the Territorial board of education. 
Afognak:—James A,Wirth, teacher. Thisschool has doubled, and during some months 
trebled the average attendance of the corresponding months of last year. 
The total enrollment has increased from twenty-four to fifty-five. If the schoolroom 
had been larger and more comfortable there would have been a much larger increase. 
Some of the boys have made such progress that they can carry on any ordinary con- 
yersation in English. ‘This obviates the further use of the Russian and Aleut languages 
by the teacher. 
The great. drawback to the school has been the want of a ebuitortale room for school 
purposes, During the coming year I trust this difficulty may be obviated, as steps are 
being taken for the erection of'a school building. 
We greatly regret to announce that, owing to the state of his wife’s health, Professor 
Wirth kas felt compelled to tender his resignation. 
By his ability as a teacher, his knowledge of the languages of the people, his tact and 
patience, he has overcome many of the difficulties incident to the establishment of a 
school in a region so remote that it has but two or three chance mails during the year, 
and among a people who have not yet learned to appreciate the advantages of an educa- 
tion. With absolutely no help from the parents, he has created such an 3 interest among 
the pupils that’they have attended school from the love of it.

] rae ; Sitka district. 
fi % o att 
Haines.—F.F. White, teacher. Total enrollment, 128. Anunusual numberof heathen 
feasts during the winter greatly interfered with the regularity of the attendance. 
It is to be hoped that the Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church, which has 
good buildings at Haines, will send a missionary there at an early date. A Government 
teacher and a missionary working together in the large Chilkat tribe would be of great 
assistance to one another. The Presbyterian Board of Home Missions has given the Gov- 
ernment the free use of their school building. 
Juneau No. 1.—Miss Rhoda A. Lee, teacher. The present has been the most success- 
ful year in the history of the school. The total enrollment increased from twenty-five 
to thirty-six, and the average attendance from nineteen to twenty-three. 
Juneau No. 2.—Miss Alice R. Hill, teacher. The total enrollment of the school de- 
creased from sixty-seven last year to fifty-eight this. : The average attendance, however, 
increased from twenty-seven to thirty-three. The pupils that were the most regular 
in their attendance and made the greatest advancement in their studies were those con- 
nected with the excellent mission home conducted by Rev. E. S. Willard and helpers, 
Juneau will soon need an additional building. 
Douglass City.—Mrs. Auna Moore, teacher. ‘The enrollment numbers ninety-four as 
against sixty-seven for 1887-88. \ 
“The progress of the school has been more or less hindered by race prejudices, 
As by far the largest attendance was by native children, the whites petitioned for a 
separate school for ‘their own children. _ As the appropriation was too small and the 
number of white children too few to justify the expense of an additional teacher, an 
arrangement was effected and instructions issued for the white children to attend school” 
in the forenoon and the native children in the afternoon, thus having two separate schools 
with but one teacher. 
This did not prove a very great success (the average attendance of white children _ 
being six and a fraction), and the Territorial board of education has. recommended for 
the coming year two teachers. 
During the summer of 1888,the Society of Friends erected a good school building, the 
use of which has been kindly furnished the Government without cost. 
Killisnoo.—Miss May Ransom, teacher. This school has moved along quietly during 
the year. Owing to the financial difficulties of the Fish Oil Works fewer. families have 
remained in the place, and the consequent attendance at school has decreased. 
Sitka No. 1.—Miss Mary Desha, Mr. Andrew Kashevarof, and Miss Cassia Patton, 
teachers. Miss Desha taught from September to January, when, receiving an appoint- 
ment in the Pension Office, she resigned and removed to Washington. 
Miss Cassia Patton, of Cochranton, Pa., was appointed to succeed her. Mr, Andrew 
Kashevarof was employed from the middle of January until Miss Patton’s arrival, the 
‘middle of February. Total enrollment for the year, sixty-seven. The success of the 
school during the year has been most gratifying to the parents of the pupils and to the 
friends of education generally. 
Sitka No, 2.—Miss Virginia Pakle, teacher. Total enrollment, fifty-one. With an 
obligatory-attendance law properly enforced the enrollment ought tobe 100 or more. 
During the year a plain but substantial and pleasant school building has been erected 
at an expense of $1,400. 
Wrangel.—Miss Lyda McAvoy: Thomas, teacher. Total enrollment, ninety. This 
model school continues to improve year by year. 
Klawack.—Rev. L. W. Currie and Mrs. M. V. Currie, teachers, 
The school year opened with sorrow in the death of Mr. Currie, who was the firstand 
only teacher the school had ever had. 
Mr. Currie was a native of North Carolina, a graduate of Hampden-Sidney College 
and Union Theological Seminary, Virginia. He gave his life to Indian education. 
He did valuable work as teacher among the Choctaw Indians, and when a call came 
for some one to go to a remnant of Indians in Southeastern Texas that were in danger 
of extinction he went to them. While there his schoolhouse was burned and his life 
threatened. To escape the malaria incident to a long continued residence in that sec- 
tion he came to Alaska and took charge of the newly ‘opened school at Klawack under 
circumstances of great heroism. Far away from any officer of the law he battled alone 
against intemperance and witchcraft. Upon one occasion four men attempted to carry 
away one of his pupils (a girl) on the charge of witchcraft. Mr. Currie rescued her, 
keeping her at his house. A few days afterwards they returned, reénforced by a party 
of Hydahs, on another attempt to get possession of her. While some of them vehe- 
mently claimed her, others stood near the missionary with open knives. Finally the 
brother of the girl was intimidated into paying a ransom for her. This Mr. Currie 
could not prevent, but the girl at least was saved, \

Mrs. Currie, being herself a teacher of long experience, was appointed to her Be, 
band’s place. Her isolation from all companionship (she was the only white woman in 
the place, and for eleven months looked into the faces of but two white women), the 
~ absence of any officer to enforce law or look after the peace of the community, the preva- 
lence of drunkenness, witchcraft, and other heathen practices, greatly interfered with 
the efficiency of the school. This is one of the most difficult places to conduct a school 
in all Southeastern Alaska, and needs a strong, self-reliant, energetic man for teacher, 
Such a one the board of education hope to secure. 
Mrs. Currie, with true Christian heroism, unflinchingly remained at her post until 
the close of the school year, when she resigned to return to her friends in the east. 
Howkan.—Miss Clara A. Gould, teacher, This excellent school, with an enrollment 
of 105, continues to maintain its reputation for efficiency.

rollment,172, This coming year Mr. Duncan confidently expects to have a boarding 
_ school for boys and | another for ats under way.

During the year a‘school building was erected for the use of Sitka School No. 2. 
Buildings have also been voted for Douglas City, Kodiak, Afognak, and Karluk. 
CONTRACT sono 
Anvik, on the Yukon River, 580 miles from St. Michael. A mission station and school 
supported by the Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Chtirch. — Teachers, 
Rev. Octavius Parker and Rey. John W. Chapman. 
The school being 3,844 miles from San Francisco, its post-office, and receiving but one 
mail a year, our latest report is dated June 1, 1888, and the statistics embodied in this 
report are those for 1887-88. 
School opened August 1, 1887, with an average aha attendance of eight. Two boys 
have had sixty lessons in the first reader. Four or five other boys have broken the back 
of reading, and there is an army of stragglers who come in more or less frequently, and 
out of whom perhaps half a dozen could "be drawn, boys and girls, who have a genuine 
and growing interest in the work of the school, and whose attendance is growing more 
regular, Several boys are writing in a fair, legible hand, and three can now write out 
‘their reading lessons in script without referring toascript alphabet. Two, the most ad- 
vanced, aged about eleven years, can write from dictation several of the first lessons 
‘with perfect accuracy, and can now understand the meaning of the greater part of what 
they read, and are talking English a little. They have been taught to analyze words 
phonetically, and when the teacher wants native words he can get them pronounced in 
a scientific manner. : 
The total enrollment of pupils was fifty. A steam saw-mill is now en route for the 
mission and will be the first of the industries established in connection with the school. 
Bethel, on the Kuskokwim River, 150 miles from its mouth. Teachers, Rev. John 
H. Killbuck and wife and Rev. E. Weber. This season Mrs. Sarah Bachman and Miss 
Carrie Detterer have been sent out to the same station. Mrs. Bachman is the wife of 
one of the bishops of 'the Moravian Church and goes out to spend a year in the work. 
Bethel is 3,029 miles from San Francisco, its post office, and has but one mail a year. 
The latest statistics received are those for 1887-88 and September, 1888. Total en- 
rollment for 1887-88, seventeen. Largest monthly average, fifteen. Enrollment for 
September, 1888, nineteen boarding pupils. 
‘This school is under the care of the Moravian Church of the United States. 
‘The teachers experience a threefold difficulty in teaching English: First, their own 
limited knowledge of the native tongue, making it difficult to convey their meaning to 
the children; second, the absence of English-speaking people i in that section; and third, 
the native disinclination to speak a foreign tongue. ' 
However, the teachers are encouraged at the perceptible improvement of their pupils 
over last year. 
Carmel, at the mouth of the Nushagak River. This school is also under the care of 
the Moravian Church. 
Teachers, Rey. and Mrs. F, E. Wolff and Miss Mary Huber. To these has recently, 
been added the Rev. John Herman Schoechert, of Watertown, Wis. 
Although Carmel is 2,992 miles from San Francisco, its post- -office, the location of 
several salmon canneries in the neighborhood, with the consequent arrival and departure 
of schooners carrying supplies, gives it several mails during the summer. Hence the 
school statistics of the present year have been received. Total enrollment twenty-five.

Delph, schoolroom; William Wells (native), interpreter; Kate, Jennie, Lottie, Ruth 
Albany, native assistants; Josephine, Russian interpreter., During the year the school 
enrolled 170 pupils, of whom 64 were girls and 106 boys. 
Of the boys 17 received instruction and practice in the shoe shop, 20 in the carpenter 
shop, 4 in the blacksmith shop, 6 in the bakery, and several in the steam laundry. 
From 25 to 30 boys have had instruction and practice in the cornet band. Two boys . 
have been sent east. to Captain Pratt’s Indian School at Carlisle, Pa., one to learn the 
printers’ trade and the other tinsmithing, and 4 of the girls of the school have been 
sent to Northfield, Mass., to be trained as teachers. The girls are at the expense of Mrs. 
Elliott F. Shepard, of New York City. 
The boys in the shoeshop have made 117 pairs of boys’ nailed shoes, 93 pairsof sewed. 
shoes, 27 pairs of girls’ sewed shoes, 9 pairs of fine sewed shoes for teachers and others; 
they also have half-soled 718 pairs of shoes, and put on 327 heels and 515 patches. 
‘The carpenter boys have erected 4 houses, besides repairing buildings and furniture. 
The boys in the steam laundry have averaged 1,000 pieces of clothing a week, and 
the boys in the bakery have made into good bread 900 pounds of flour per week 
Three of the boys during the winter netted a large fishing seine, and one has done'some 
good coopering. 
Arrangements are under way for the establishment of a steam sawmill and planer as 
one of the regular industries of the school. 
Last summer visitors presented the school with 21 brass instruments, and a band was 
organized among the pupils. 
The North Star, a small illustrated monthly paper, has been regularly published in 
connection with the school. 
Recently, in the absence of any Government reformatory, the United States district 
court of Alaska, Judge Keatly presiding, placed a boy and girl in the school. 
Extensive improvements have been made this summer by the boys on the grounds of 
the institution. 
The mission board and their employés, in connection with the school, are sparing no 
pains or labor to increase the efficiency and usefulness of the institution, and are encour- 
aged by a manifest advance from year to year. 
The schoo! is not only molding and lifting up the pupils directly under its care, but 
also their parents and friends. 
It is also forming a public sentiment which indirectly helps.every school in the Ter- 
ritory. During June, July, and August, when the steamers come crowded with tourists, 
all the other schools are closed for vacation, and until the visitors reach Sitka they see 
the native children only in their dirt and filth, so that the impressson is formed that 
nothing can be done with them, , 
To correct this unfavorable judgment and demonstrate that the natives are capable of 
civilization and education, the superintendent of the school, upon the arrival of each 
steamer, sends the tourists an invitation to visit the institution. The pupils are called 
together for recitations, singing, and other exercises. The strangers are shown over the 
buildings and taken into the workrooms, etc. The result is that these visitors from. 
every section of the land carry to their homes and tell to their friends what their eyes 
have seen of the progress of Alaskan children in the schools. 
These testimonies create a favorable and growing public sentiment, that finds expres- 
sion in the annual Congressional appropriation for education in Alaska. /

- The Russian Government, through the medium of the Russo-Greek Church, is reported 
as having seventeen parochial schools. These have largely been taught in the Russian 
language. It is said that their’ bishop has issued instructions to all the priests and 
teachers to use the English language. While for the first few years the teaching in 
English by teachers themselves learning the language will not be very efficient, it yet 
marks a step forward, and gives the promise of better things in the future. 
In the annual report of the governor for 1888 it is stated thatthe Greek churches and 
parochial schools in Alaska cost the Russian Government $60,000 annually. 
The Roman Catholic Church, with headquarters and bishop’s residence at Victoria, 
British Columbia, have a school at Juneau, and claim two in process of establishment 
upon the Yukon River, one at Kozyrof, near Leatherville; and the other between Auvik 
- and Nulato, and one at St. Michael, on Bering Sea.\ These are in charge of Jesuit 
_ priests, } ; ‘ 
_ The Church of England is reported. to have a school at Nuklukahyet, on the Yukon 
River. 7 
The Free Mission Society of Sweden has schools at Unalaklik, on Bering Sea, and Yakutat, 
at the base of Mount St. Elias. Owing to the inaccessibleness of these schools and the 
absence of mail communications but little is known concerning them. 
The Presbyterian Church of the United States, through its Board of Home Missions, has a 
flourishing day school, with a total enrollment of 155 pupils at, Hoonah. 
This school is taught by Rev. and Mrs. John W. McFarland. It has also an excel- 
lent ‘‘home,”’ with twenty-five boys and girls, at Juneau, under the admirable manage- 
ment of Rev. and Mrs. Eugene 8. Willard, assisted by Miss Bessie Matthews and Miss 
Jennie Dunbar. This school is a feeder for the Industrial Training School at Sitka. 
It has a second ‘‘home’’ at Howkan, with about twenty-five girls, in charge of Mrs. 
A. R. McFarland, so well and favorably known in the Church. At both of these 
“thomes”’ the children are fed, clothed, cared for, and trained in household duties. 
For their literary training the children attend the Government day schools.

Office of general agent. 
The general agent at the beginning of the year, being unable to secure transportation 
from Sitka to the schools of western Alaska on the U. 8S. S. Thetis, that was making 
the trip, requested permission of the U. S. Commissioner of Education to proceed to 
San Francisco and take passage by the steamers of the Alaska Commercial Company. 
Permission not being granted, I have been tinable to carry out the instructions of the 
honorable the Secretary of the Interior to visit all the schools at least once a year, 
+ Indeed, for the want of transportation I have been unable to visit the schools of south- 
western Alaska since I established them in 1886, and those on Bering Sea not at all. 
’ This has been greatly regretted both by myself and the teachers. 
Also for want of transportation I haye been unable to visit the schools at Howkan 
and Klawack, ‘on Prince of Wales Island. 
_ The schools at Sitka, Juneau, Wrangell, Douglass, Haines, and Killisnoo have been 
_ visited several times, and that of Metlakahtla twice. ae 
st \ RECOMMENDATIONS, piers 
\ I have the honor to submit the following recommendations: - 
1. An inspection of the schools of western Alaska by the general agent.—In view of the fact 
that I have been unable to reach those schools for three years, and as the time has come 
for establishing new schools in that region, some of which have already been recom- 
mended by the Territorial board of education, and as it is probable that a Government 
vessel will be sent nextsummer to that section to convey Government officials, therefore 
_ it is recommended that the U. 8. Commissioner of Education be respectfully requested 
to arrange for the transportation of the general agent. 
~ 2. Change in supervision.—In order that the general agent may for the next two or 
_ three years give the larger part of his time to developing the school work in Western 
| Alaska, I would recommend thé following change in section 4, division 2, of the rules 
and regulations for the conduct of education in Alaska, to wit: First, that the general 
agent be relieved for the coming year from the local superintendency of the Sitka dis- 
“trict, and be given the local superintendency of the Kodiak and Unalaska districts. — 
Second, that a district superintendent be appointed for the Sitka district. 4 
' 3, Permanent school fund,—I would again renew my recommendations of 1886-87 and 
1887-88, which recommendations were also indorsed by the Territorial board of educa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
   ‘EDUCATION IN ALASKA. | ‘ 163 
  tion, that the U. 8. Commissioner of Education be respectfully requested to procure leg- 
islation from Congress permanently appropriating a sum of money for the education of 
the children of Alaska without distinction of race. , 3 
The present method of supporting the schools of Alaska by an annual appropriation 
from Congress is very unsatisfactory. As Congress one year voted $25,000 and the sec- 
ond nothing and the third $15,000, it can readily be seen that neither the school board 
nor the teachers can arrange for the schools until after Congressional action has been 
taken, nor until such action is had can they be sure that there will be any schools. 
And not only that, but some years the action of Congress is not known in Alaska until 
three months after the fiscal school year commences. A failure on the part of Congress 
any one year to make the necessary appropriation would close the schools, scatter Gov- 
ernment property, and throw the teachers out of employment thousands of miles away 
from home and friends. | 
The disadvantages of the present system need but to be stated to be seen, 
In the Western States and Territories the general land laws of the country provide 
that sections 16 and 36 in each township be set apart for the use of the schools in said 
‘ States and Territories. In some of the States this has been a munificent endowment. 
But Alaska has no townships and no surveyed lands and no law by which they can 
be surveyed. And when in course of time the general land laws are extended over it, 
the nature of the country and the nthe! climate and the requirements of the popula--     
               
   
             
tion will prevent to any great extent the laying out of the land in sections of a mile 
square. Thus while no school fund is practicable for years to come from the lands, the 
’ General Government derives a regular revenue from the seal islands and other sources, 
a portion of which could be used in the place of the proceeds of the sale of school lands, 
4, An obligatory attendance law.—The operation of the obligatory attendance law which 
was enacted by the Territorial board of education and approved by the honorable the 
Secretary of the Interior in 1887, has been recently suspended by order of the United 
States Commissioner of Education. 1 3 
In view of the importance of some suitable law for securing the more regular attend- 
ance at school of the children of Alaska, the Territorial board of education at its semi- 
annual meeting June 14-19 took the following action: 
‘* Whereas it is the invariable experience of ali who have been engaged or interested 
for years in the difficult task of attempting to educate and civilize the natives and creoles 
of Alaska thatthe greatest obstacles ‘to success are, first, the want of adequate means of 
securing the regular and general attendance of the children of these peopleat the various ~ 
Government schools and, second, the stolid indifference, superstition, and fearofchange' 
on the part of the greater number of the parents of such children; and pe 
‘Whereas experience has also demonstrated that wherever native policemen have 
been employed and paid heretofore a moderate compensation for gathering these chil- 
dren into the schoolrooms and thus compelling attendance, not only is the average attend- 
ance itself largely increased, but an interest in the progress of the pupils and the success 
,of the schools themselves has been gradually and permanently created in those native 
and creole parents; and . 
‘‘ Whereas, the Governmentof the United States is annually appropriating large sams 
of money for the purpose of educating and civilizing these people and employing com- 
petent and zealous teachers for that purpose, who are making great‘sacrifices by endur- 
ing severe privations, general discomfort, and personal isolation among an alien and 
barbarous race of people: Therefore, } 
Be it resolved by the Territorial board of education, That the Hon. Lyman E. Knapp, 
the governor of the District of Alaska, is hereby requested and urged to embody in his 
forthcoming annual report to the Department of the Interior the suggestions we have 
made herein, with the reeommendation that Congress take the subject of compulsory 
education of the natives and creoles of Alaska into consideration, and, in addition to. 
making the usual appropriations for the schools of the District, add thereto such enact- 
ments as will compel the regular attendance of the pupils at such schools asare already. 
established or may be hereafter provided.” 
I renew my recommendations of former reports on this subject. 
5. School police. —With the granting of an obligatory attendance law, and even with- 
out it, the appointment of a native policeman in thenative villages where schools exist, 
whose duty shall be tosee that thechildren are in school, will greatly increase the present 
attendance. 
I therefore recommend that an allowance of ten or fifteen dollars per month be allowed from the school fund for the employment of such men. : 
6. Irecommend that the honorable the Secretary of the Interior be respectfully re- quested to ask Congress for an appropriation of $75,000 for education in Alaska for the’ year ending June 30, 1891, 
7. In 1887-88 the Territorial board of education recommended to the United States

EDUCATION: REPORT, 1888-89. ~ { i i Free ' s 
Commissioner of Education that the salary of the general agent of education be increased 
to $2,400 annually. ‘ 
As nothing was done, I respectfully ask the board to renew the request. 
‘In closing this report I can not permit to pass unchallenged the statement made by 
the president of the Territorial board of education, which appears on page 181 of the 
Annual Report of the Commissioner of Education, 1887-88, that my annual report for 
1887-88 was recalled by the board of education in Alaska because of ‘‘a number of ma- 
terial inaccuracies in the report.”” My report for that year was regularly indorsed and 
approved by the board, ex-Governor Swineford not being present, on September 15, 1888, 
_ and forwarded to the Commissioner of Educaticn. ( 
At a meeting of the board on October 31, 1888, four members being present, Mr. Swine- 
ford delivered a tirade against the general agent of education, claiming that some of the 
‘statements of the annual report were false and demanding that the vote of approval be 
_ +» Yeconsidered. This demand was refused by the board. The report had been officially 
sent to the Commissioner, and could not be recalled, or changed, if recalled, except by 
my consent. = 
_ However, to give Mr. Swineford an opportunity of pointing out alleged falsehoods I 
consented to a resolution (and without my consent the resolution could not have been 
passed) asking the Commissioner of Education to send the board a certified copy of the    
the regular official report of schools in Alaska. 
At a subsequent meeting of the board, January 23, 1889 (the general agent being 
absent), although a certified copy of my report had been received from Washington, it 
_ was neither read nor considered, but Judge Keatley was directed to make out a ‘‘new 
report and transmit the same to the Commissioner of Education.”” 
This was not a substitute for the report of the general agent, as no one could legally 
make that report but himself. It was not even a report on education in Alaska, because 
Judge Keatley had recently come into the, Territory and had no personal knowledge vt) 
its school affairs at that time, With his usual good judgment he did not attempt a re- 
port, but confined himself mainly to some general statements with regard to a few of 
the schools in southeastern Alaska, and particularly the training school at Sitka, of 
which he had some personal knowledge. His report was never submitted to the consid- 
eration of or approved by a yote of the Territorial board of education. In making his 
reflections upon the report of the general agent he was evidently misled by the assertions 
      
of Mr. Swineford, which were never proven, and I take this first opportunity since the _ 
publi: hing of the report of 1887-88 to deny that the report of the general agent for that 
year contains ‘‘a number of material inaccuracies.’’ 
Very truly yours, '

‘A.—REMARKS RELATING TO THE SUMMARY oF SraTisTiIcs or Crry Sonoozs (Ta- 
BLE 11), AND INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY THERETO. 
In the previous Reports of this Office it has been customary to include in the tables of 
summaries only those cities from which definite information was at hard. The table 
immediately following marks a departure from that method, in that it not only includes 
all the accurate data available, but also such estimates to supply deficiencies as may be 
regarded as reasonably reliable. The result desired is to secure a set of totals which 
will be totals in reality, and not the sum of results attained in a varying number of 
cities, leaving the rest unmentioned and unknown. The table is not without fault, but, 
inasmuch as all the cities are taken into account, it more nearly represents the sum of 
achievement of city schools than any similar table which has previously appeared. 
The forthcoming federal census will probably show the number of cities and villages 
containing over 4,000 inhabitants to be somewhat greater or less than 768, the number 
included in the table, and if so, each item of the totals would be subject to correction. 
Numerous difficulties are experienced in perfecting the list of cities, and it may even 
now contain a few that do not possess the characteristics of cities to the extent necessary 
to their proper classification here, and it is equally true that some may have been omit- 
ted which have recently so grown and developed as to entitle them to be classified 
among urban communities,

/DIFFERENCES IN LOCAL ORGANIZATION. HY ¥ . Vf 
Such are the differences in local organization and government in the several States 
that the question of population is far from being the only perplexing element with whieh 
it is necessary to contend in this connection. Among the peculiarities which appear 
and which often involve problems of considerable difficulty may be mentioned— 
‘1. The village of Edgewater, N. Y., which has a population of about 10,000 in two 
independent “ towns,’’ is in three separate postal districts, not one of which bears the 
_ name of the village, and contains four school districts which have no direct connection 
with each other. 
/ 2, The cities of Florida, incorporated as cities, but whose schools are managed by 
_ county officers in the same way and upon the same basis as the adjacent rural schools. 
_ - 3, Some Western cities, including Denver, Colo., which embrace three entirely inde- 
pendent school organizations among which the territory is divided. 
4, A few Southern cities, notably Washington, D. C., which contain two full sets of 
school officers, working side by Side, in the same field, but in behalf of different races. 
5. Certain New England villages, which, though containing several thousand inhabi- 
tants and important business interests, have no legal status, save as parts of the ‘‘ towns’? 
in which they are situated. Many of these viliages, unincorporated and amenable to 
the government of “town” or township officers, contain twice the population that 
would be expected in the South or the West to constitute a ‘‘city,”? with mayor and 
couneil, board of education, aad ail the other embellishments of a full grown munici- 
pality. * - 
, ‘ 
Such anomalies as these, and they are many, necessarily involve such varying meth- 
ods of recording and reporting school data that it is not reasonable to hope for a strictly RELIABILITY OF SCHOOL STATISTICS. 
accurate summary of the conditions of education in all places that may be properly 
considered in a general way as cities, even if all forwarded reports as nearly correct as 
the circumstances in each case would permit.’ But of the 768 cities reliable statistics of 
713 or 92.8 per cent. of the entire number were secured and are incorporated in Tables 
14 to 19. ‘As will be seen from the Tables referred to, many of the cities failed to re- 
port some of the items—on an average each item was omitted by probably 10 per cent. 
of the cities. ‘These omissions and failures to report amount, therefore, to over one- 
sixth of the whole. This deficiency has been supplied by estimates based in each case 
upon the ratios developed by the surrounding cities or States, J 
Tn those cases in which no report was made.of population excepting the estimated 
total, as in the cities of Pennsylvania and Minnesota, the population between six and 
fourteen was estimated by applying to the total population reported the ratio existing 
between the two at the last general census. ‘ ‘ 
This explanation is given in order that the limitations to be placed upon the accuracy 
of the table may be fully known. ' 
RELATIVE QUANTITY or ScrooL WorK DONE IN THE CITY AND IN THE COUNTRY 
' ScHOOLS, 
A comparison of the facts developed by this table with the figures shown in the tables 
of school statistics of States in Chapter X XII of this Report shows the importance of the 
\eity school systems in the educational field in a very strong light. 
' 
THE PROPER MEASURE OF SCHOOL WORK. 
; : 
‘The truest measure of the quantity of work done is not the number of pupils enrolled, 
_ for that number may include those whose stay in school was too short to produce any 
tangible result; nor the average attendance, for that gives no idea of the time attended; 
nor the length of the school term, for that furnishes no clue to the number of children. 
The only quantity that takes all these things into consideration is what is technically 
called the ‘‘aggregate, or total attendance,’’ which is determined by simply adding to- 
_ gether the number of days every pupil was present in school. The result is the total 
number of days attended by all pupils, and may be said to be a measure of the total 
amount of instruction given. | 
Taking this item as the basis of comparison, it appears that 35.3 per cent., consider- 
ably over one-third, of all theinstruction reperted in public schools in the United States 
is given in cities, since the aggregate number of days’ attendance onthe part of all public 
school pupils in the entire country was 1,076,613,716, and the corresponding quantity 
for the cities alone was 379,800,612. .

CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. ae ¥ a Feist Na it ve 
This, taken in connection with the fact that only 26.2 per cent. of the population 6 
to 14, and only 22.6 per cent. of the whole enrollment are reported in the cities, shows 
the result of the more regular attendance and the longer school terms in the cities, 
DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF WORK. | 
Let it be remembered that this estimate takes into consideration only the quantity of 
work done. A day in a ‘‘backwoods”’ country schoo! is placed upon the same footing 
with a day in the finest school in the country. It does not, nor can it, introduce the 
question of quality of instruction in any way whatever. There can be little doubt that 
the portion of the nation’s school work which the city systems do would be proved to 
be not far from one-half of the whole if it were possible to show on one hand the loss 
of time in so many rural schools by reason of frequent changes of teachers and methods © 
of instruction, misdirected efforts and fruitless work resulting from inexperience or 
incompetence, lack of proper equipment and helps to teaching; and on the other hand, 
the advantages which accrue to the schools of the cities from close organization, skillful 
supervision, consultation of teachers, more or less permanent tenure of office, good- 
houses and a fairly abundant quantity of supplies and apparatus that go far toward 
smoothing the rough road of instruction. 4 
REGULARITY OF ATTENDANCE GREATER IN CITIES. 
As stated above, the attendance of children enrolled is far more regular in cities than 
in country schools, the ratio being 71.4 per cent. in cities and 65.1 per cent. in the 
United States as a whole. This difference will probably never be overcome, for it is 
impossible in the country to reach the city standard of accessibility of schoolhouses, 
‘even if the teaching were as attractive and the buildings themselves were as favorable 
to regular attendance. In the matter of length of term there is more reason to hope 
for improvement, for in some States there is now very little difference between the city 
\and the country schools in this respect. At present the average length of the school 
year is 191:6 days in the cities alone and 134.5 days in the entire country at large. 
x NUMBER OF TEACHERS AND THEIR SALARIES. 
Only about one-seventh of the whole number of teachers in the United States are em- 
ployed in city schools, but of the amount expended for teaching and supervision, 36.1 
per cent. is paid by the cities. Except the showing of the approximately exact figures, 
nothing new is developed by this, for it is self-evident that large graded schools require 
a relatively small number of teachers; and it has been a matter of general regret since » 
the inception of the public-school system that the wages paid country school-teachers 
are pitifully small. The greater length of the school term is also a factor which ma- 
terially increases the proportion paid to city teachers. 
There is very little difference in the average cost of tuition for each day’s attendance 
of a pupil in the city and in the country, being 8.3 cents in one case and about 8.1 cents 
in the other. Thisnear approach to equality is due solely to the low salaries paid in the 
country. If country teachers were paid at the same rate per diem as city teachers, ow- 
ing to the proportionally greater number required, the average cost of one day’s instruc- 
tion for one pupil in the country would be about 15.9 cents, or almost twice as much as 
in the cities. / re 
NUMBER AND VALUE OF SCHOOLHOUSES. ¢ 
There are 216,330 schoolhouses in the United States, and only 7,670, or 3.5 per cent, of - 
them, are in the cities—another instance of the economy possible in a dense population. 
In the United States, exclusive of cities, there is an average of one building to every 43 
persons between 6 and 14 years of age, or one to every 29 pupils in average daily attend-. 
ance in school, while in the cities the average is only one building to every 415 persons 
_ between 6 and 14, or to every 258 persons in average attendance. 
The value of school property in the cities amounts to 52.8 per cent. of the whole. In 
other words, 7,670, buildings with. their sites and furnishings are more valuable than. 
all the remaining 208,660 houses with their grounds and equipments. Of course this 
is due principally to the great superiority of the city buildings in size, quality, and 
furnishing, but the great. difference between land values in urban and rural localities’ 
‘affects the ratio, although it would be impossible to definitely determine to what extent. 
The average value of each. building, including site, furniture, etc., in the entire 
United States is $1,495; in the cities it is $25,583, ;

B.—REMARKS RELATING TO THE COMPARATIVE STATISTICS (TABLES 12 
AND 13), WITH SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. 
CoMPARISON OF STATISTICS. 
The meaning of the quantities shown in the table is brought out more clearly by the 
ratios and percentages in Tables 12and 13, Itis only by comparison that the full value of 
statistics can be realized. The comparison may be with the results attained in thesame 
direction at a different period, or with the effects of similar efforts in other localities, or 
with other circumstances in the same locality which increase or limit the possibility of 
effective action. Then, most important of all in national statistics, comparisons may 
be instituted between different localities to determine the points of excellence of one 
over the other, taking into consideration the governing circumstances in each case, in 
order that the deficiencies of all may be remedied. To present opportunities for such 
comparisons, Tables 12 and 13 are presented. In each State the relation is shown between 
the principal controlling circumstances and the aggregate of results produced in all the 
cities reported, 
Ratio or ToTAL ENROLLMENT TO POPULATION: 6-14, IN CITIES. 
  First, the number of children who received instruction, either in public or private 
schools, is compared with the whole number of children between six and fourteen years 
of age. South Carolina, Texas, and Kentucky make the poorest showing in this respect, 
each of them having less than three-fourths as many pupils enrolled in city schools as 
there are children of elementary school age. California, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, 
Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oregon, 
Rhode Island, Washington, *and Wisconsin exhibit highly creditable.-ratios, while 
Colorado and Maine are so far in advance of all the other States as to create a suspicion 
that the school census upon which the population 6-14 was estimated contained an un- 
due proportion of errors. Without an exhaustive examination into all the causes that 
produce the low and the high ratios, it may be stated that without a single exception 
all the States in which the percentages are noticeably low are Southern States in which 
there is a large negro population, whose failure or inability to take advantage of even 
the educational opportunities offered them is well known; and all theStates mentioned 
as showing ereditably high percentages, excepting Indiana, Towa, and Oregon,! have 
upon their statute books laws compelling the attendance of all childreninschool. The 
‘compulsory laws are not, it is true, sufficiently effective to compel the attendance of 
those determined to remain at home, but they do exert an influence that is no less pow- 
erful for being outside the court room. Law-abiding and well-meaning people do not 
obey a law merely because a penalty is attached. To many of them the payment of the 
penalty would mean no-hardship. But they respect the law simply as an expression 
of the public will intended for the public good, and obey it accordingly. There is no 
doubt that the compulsory-attendance laws often operate in this way to keep children 
in school when circumstances might otherwise make longer attendance a matter of doubt. 
  
1 Oregon has recently passed a compulsory-attendance law,
-P-A-G-E-107
  CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, = 7169 
Another light in which this eoineidence between the existence of high attendance -~ 
ratios and compulsory laws may be viewed, even when admittedly inefficient, is that 
each is but,an index to the favorable public sentiment toward ‘education existing in 
those States; and that since both spring from the same cause, neither is due to the other. 
The former explanation will be acceptable to the promoters of compulsion i in educa- 
tion, while the latter will meét the approval of the opposing party. There is truth in ~ 
both. 
In the enrollment in public schools alone the States hold practically the same rank as 
before, the Southern States falling far in the rear, and the highest BR CTAEES being pro- 
duced in Colorado and Maine. 
Ratio oF AGGREGATE ATTENDANCE TO POPULATION 6-14, 
Column 8, however, is the best criterion presented, for it shows the relation between 
the aggregate attendance and the population. In this, Massachusetts leads. 
The instruction given in the cities of that State was sufficient to give to each child of 
elementary school age 174.3 days. Maine, California, Connecticut, Nevada, Colorado, 
and West Virginia ‘follow in the order named, and Florida, Mississippi, ‘and Texas 
are last in the list. It will be remembered that this proportion is affected by the . 
length of the school term, a matter in the control of the cities themselves; by the num- 
ber of children brought into school, which varies with the activity of the teachers and 
school officers; and by the regularity of attendance, which is largely dependent upon 
the children and their parents. Massachusetts leads in the relative amount of school 
work done, because the school term is invariably long; nearly all children that could be 
expected to be in school are not only there, but are closely and carefully held to their . 
work, as the high per cent. of attendance ‘in column 6 proves. The relative amount, 
paid to supervising officers and teachers in Massachusetts is larger than in any other 
Peutain State,! and this undoubtedly is a very important factor in accomplishing the 
result mentioned, for itis natural that more intelligent teachers would be attracted by 
the larger pay offered; the effect is seen in the record of the pupils’ attendance, An- 
other fact shown by the statistics that may be adduced as having a direct bearing upon 
the amount of instruction given is, that in Massachusetts the accommodations more 
nearly meet the requirements of the school population than in.any other State, except- ~ 
ing Maine. ‘ 
PRIVATE AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 
In the matter of attendance in private and parochial schools in cities, New Hampshire 
and Vermont are entitled to precedence, for in the cities of each of these States over a 
third of the children in school are in institutions of that class. 
The States showing the next largest proportion of private school enrollment in cities 
are Utah, Illinois, South Carolina, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, and Indiana, in all 
of which the percentage is over 25; and Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, 
North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin, in which between 20 and 25 per 
cent. of the enrollment is in schools not under public control. 
To assign as a general reason for a large private school enrollment their superiority 
to the public schools would be fallacious, because in many of the States included in the 
above category the city schools are of undoubted excellence. It would be equally un- 
reasonable to ascribe, as has frequently been done, such a condition of things to over- 
organization and too much centralization in the publie schools, for if this were true, 
Connecticut and Massachusetts, the two most thoroughly organized States in the Union, 
would not show such a small proportion in private schools. 
The truth is that no one cause is operative in all States, and the same effect is pro- 
duced by different circumstances in different localities. In New Hampshire, Vermont, 
and in other States the cause doubtless lies largely in the general withdrawal of Cath: 
olic children from the public schools; in many of the States of the South the public 
school idea has not yet attained its full measure of popularity, and in many places the 
population increases more rapidly than the public school facilities, and private schools 
reap the benefit. Insufficiency as an aid to private schools is far more potent than in- 
efficiency, for a well-taught and conspicuously successful public school arouses a gen- 
eral interest in education which manifests itself first by filling the public school to its 
| capacity and then im the increased prosperity of neighboring private educational estab- 
lishments if the public school accommodations are not sufficient. On the contrary, if 
the instruction in the public school is indifferent—neither good nor bad, but not of the 
kind to arouse the enthusiasm of the pupils and maintain the interest of "their parents— 
the private schools must rely principally for their patronage upon the more limited class

of people in easy financial circumstances who may be expected to patronize select schools 
under any ordinary conditions. Others, knowing public schools to, be available with- » 
out direct cost, would hesitate or refuse to incur needless extra expense, and should their 
_ interest wane on account of the failure of the public school to meet their anticipations, 
the result is a loss to the public school, from which the private school will derive no ad- 
vantage. ; 
PROPORTION, OF Pupits In City Hie Scrooxs.? 
In the proportion of pupils in city high schools, Vermont, with 9.9 per cent., leads the 
list, and Nevada, New Hampshire, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Maine follow. The 
tendency of pupils to stop before completing the course is very much less pronounced in 
small than in large cities,” and it will be noticed that all the cities of the States just 
named are only of moderate size at most. This accounts in part for the superiority of | 
the percentages shown by these States, but full credit is nevertheless due them, for in 
cities of the lowest class in 1887-88 the percentage of high-school pupils was 7.3, or less 
‘than that in any State mentioned except Maine. 
WHAT Proportion of THE PUPILS RecEIvE HiaH-Scroon INSTRUCTION? 
/ 
No item of school statistics is misunderstood oftener than that referred to in the fore- 
going paragraph. Even the friends of public high schools sometimes fall into the error 
of considering that the percentage of pupils in the high schools at any one time repre- 
sents the proportion of the children who receive high-school instruction; their opponents, 
similarly erring, make free use of this alleged insignificant’ proportion and reference 
to it may be found in every paper whose object is to belittle the work of public high 
schools. = 
A conspicuous use of this wholly erroneous use of statistics may be found in an enter- 
taining little book on ‘‘ Our Common School System,’’ which emanated from the pen of 
a well-known lady writer a few years ago. This author presents many of the old argu- _ 
ments against public high schools, clothed, however, in new and attractive dress, and 
among them places this: 1 
“Tt is true that the high school is, in theory, open to all, but actually it is only the 
very few who cafi and do take advantage of it. Of every hundred pupils who attend 
- the lower schools, statistics show that not more than five, in many places not more than 
three, attend the high school. The majority get no benefit from the high schools, other 
than that indirect benefit which they get equally from private academies and colleges. 
They yet reap, indeed, disadvantage; for too often the instruction in the lower schools 
is shaped, not to the greatest good of the great number who are to find their only school- 
ing in these schools, but to the demands of those who are to go into the high school. 
‘The grammar school aims to fit pupils for the high school. It shapes its course of study 
for the five pupils who will graduate at the high school. It ought to fit pupils for en- 
tering active life intelligent. It ought to shape its course of instruction for the ninety- 
five or ninety-seven who will have no course of instruction except that which the grammar 
schools furnish.’’ ’ . 
‘The same erroneous assertion is made in the same chapter to prove that we do not 
get the masses into the high schools after we establish them, for ‘‘the high school: 
plucks only from 3 to 5 per cent. out of the masses to guide their studies, while the 
remaining ninety-five are left to regulate their own reading just as if there were no high 
schools at all;’? and again in bewailing the ‘‘evil * * * that the best teachers, the 
most highly educated and most highly paid, are not put into the primary schools, where 
all the children have the benefit of their culture, but into the high schools, where only 
3 or 5 per cent. of the children come in contact with them.” 
These extracts are not introduced here in order that the arguments they contain might 
be refuted, but merely to show an instance of the glaring misuse of statistics, the fal- 
lacy of which almost invariably escapes notice. 
The ratio represented in the table shows the relative popularity of the high schools 
sufficiently tor comparison between cities, etc.; nothing more. 
If it is desired to know what per cent. of all the children enrolled receive the bene- 
fits of instruction in the high schools, it is necessary not only that those now in that 
department be considered, but all those yet in the elementary grades who eventually 
reach the high school must also be taken into the calculation. 
A concrete example will make this plain. Suppose that every child in the United 
States were in school in that grade which corresponds to his age\according to the usual 
classification, and that every child were annually promoted to the next higher class un-

til he completes the course, or until his death, if that should occur prior to his gradua- 
tion. Jn sucha case, taking the census of 1880 as a basis, the number in the eight 
_ elementary grades would be 9,766,696, i. ¢., the total population between 6 and 14 
years of age. At the same time there would be 3,941,365 pupils in the four high-school » 
grades, whose ages would be from 14 to 18 years. Only 28.7 per cent. of the whole 
number would be in the high schoolsatany one time. But, according to the hypothesis, 
all who live long enough graduate, and ‘‘the proportion who reach the high schools’? 
_ would therefore be 100 per cent. Now if 28.7 per cent. represents the high-school en- 
rollment when ail reach that school, 4.5, which is now the actual proportion for the 
United States, indicates that 4°,, or 15.7 per cent. of all the pupils enrolled do actually 
reach the high schools. 
This proportion can not be far from the correct one. 
CoMPARISON OF RATIOS FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. 
The statistics of cities have been presented in a form similar to that of Tables 12 and 
13, in two Annual Reports prior to the one of which this is a part. 
In order that the idea of comparison may be further carried out, the principal ratios ~ 
developed in the cities reporting in those years are reproduced below in connection with 
the corresponding percentages for 1888-89,

It appears, therefore, that during the period included the school population has in- 
creased more rapidly than the schools. [From one-fifth greater than the population six 
to fourteen in 1886-87 the whole enrollment in all schools has fallen to one-tenth greater 
in 1888-89. In the public schools ‘there is a smaller proportion of the population, but _. 
a slightly larger proportion of the whole enrollment, showing a gainof 1.8 per cent. upon 
the private institutions. In regularity of attendance there has been a gain of 1,3 per cent., 
and in the length of time each enrolled pupil remained in school there was an increase 
over last year, though the standard of 1886-87 was notreached. In the aggregate amount 
of instruction as compared with population six to fourteen there has been a decrease of 
4 days from last year and 6.1 days from 1886-87. The proportion of enrollment in high 
schools is the same as the two previous years, and though the other items show slight 
changes they are not indicative of a general tendency either for the better or for the 
‘worse. 
C.—REMARKS AND SUPPLEMENTARY STATISTICS SUGGESTED BY THE ~ 
TABLES OF DETAILED STATISTICS (Nos. 14, TO 19, INCLUSIVE). 
In the following tables are presented the facts necessary to a full exhibit of the edu- 
cational conditions of 711 cities and villages, representing a total estimated population 
of 19,787,991. This number of cities is the largest that has ever been represented in 
the reports of this office, a fact all the more gratifying because the similar tables of 
previous reports included a great many New England ‘‘ towns’’ which coutain no com- 
munities sufficiently thickly settled to entitle them to be classed’as ‘‘urban,”? This 
   
-P-A-G-E-110
        m2 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. ’ 
error was due to the peculiar signification of the ical “town? as it is used in New 
England, New York, and New Jersey. There the name is applied to a division of a 
ui spunky, a portion of territory corresponding very nearly to what is called in the West 
a ‘‘township”’ and in some parts of the South a ‘‘beat.’” In all other States the same 
word is commonly applied to a thickly populated community somewhat more preten- 
tious in size than a village; to this differeace in usage was probably due the improper 
consideration of some of the New England towns upon the same basis as cities contain- 
ing the same number of inhabitants. In this report they have been eliminated as far 
as. possible, though a few may yet remain because of the uncertainty felt regarding 
their exact status. 
To avoid if possible any misapprehension as to the scope of these tables and to prevent 
incorrect returns, the word ‘‘town’? isno longer employed in this connection. ‘To indi- 
cate, however, that any assemblage of housesin which 4. ,000 or more persons reside may be 
included, whether or not designated a city by local laws, the term ‘‘village’’ is used, 
since that will not be liable to be misunderstood in any section, and will exactly apply 
‘in many States. 
NUMBER OF SUPERVISING OFFICERS. ‘ 
An attempt is begun in Table 15 to show the number of officers in the several cities 
whose time is devoted wholly or principally to supervision. Being entirely new to many 
correspondents as an item of statistics, the replies were not as numerous nor the informa- 
tion elicited as satisfactory as might have been desired, but it is hoped that the next re- 
port will show a great improvement in both respects. The question of supervision is an 
important one and is receiving increased attention. The relative number of supervising 
officers and teachers, showing the degree of the closeness of supervision, and the relative 
increase in the number of supervisors from year to year, showing the growth of the sys- 
tem of supervision, can be best exhibited by statistics. 
In the table referred to 484 cities report 1,928 supervisors, or an average of 4 to each 
city. If this‘average hold good for all the 768 cities in the United States, the whole 
number of supervisors would be over 3,000, but it will be noticed that the majority of 
the cities not reporting the item are smal], and in many instances the blank is undoubt-. 
edly equivalent toa cipher. It is not likely that the unreported 284 cities employ more 
than 400 persons who devote enough time to supervision to be properly considered super- 
visors. If this conjecture—it is no more—approach the truth, the whole number of 
supervising officers in all the cities would be not far from 2,300. 
  WHOLE NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED IN INSTRUCTION. 
A column is also given in the same table designed to show the number of substitute 
teachers regularly employed, but the information it contains is even less satisfactory 
than thatin relation tosupervisors. Three hundred and thirty-nine cities report that they 
employ a total 1,955 substitutes. In this case, too, many of the blanks that appear 
may indicate a negative answer, but the item is not reported by a number of large cities 
in wh'ch it is known that a great many substitutes are absolutely necessary. Onethou- | 
sand would be a moderate estimate of the number employed but uot reported; this 
would make the whole number of substitutes 2,955, } 
Now, if to the 51,981 regular class teachers reported in Table 11 we add 2,300 super- 
visors and 2,955 substitutes, the whole number of persons directly and continuously 
employed in the instruction of children in city schools is shown to be 57,236. This 
number is not made a part of the table of totals upon page 783 for obvious reasons, but it 
is given here for what it is worth. 
AVERAGE SALARY OF TEACHERS. 
The statistics relating to the average salaries of teachers presented in Table 15 have not 
proved to be as useful as it was hoped they would be. It isevident that the figures reported 
were not obtained according to any uniform method, and it may be doubted whether 
they present an altogether trustworthy basis of comparison. The information conveyed 
by the “‘average annual salary of teachers”? is at best vague and uncertain, and to beofany 
value for statistical purposes it is necessary that it have the same signification in all 
cases. 
'TEXT-BOOKS. 
In column 14, Table 15, 0 are placed the replies to the question relating to the eystem of 
opie of text-books. Six hundred and thirty-five cities responded, 115 reporting that

certain grades or in certain studies, and 2 that books are purchased by school authorities 
and sold at cost to pupils. The remaining 502 replies indicate that the pupils them- 
selves purchase their books in open market. _ A considerable proportion of the cities of 
the last class loan books tree to pupils unable to buy them; 75 superintendents mention 
the existence of this custom, but it is known that this number does not include all the 
cities in which indigents are thus supplied. 
The geographical location of the 116 cities in which the free text-book plan prevails 
is shown by the following table: , 5 :

In Massachusetts a State law requires that all books be furnished by the cities and 
towns, and thus it happens that of all the cities reported 42 per cent. are in that State. 
Similar laws have since been enacted in Maine and New Hampshire. In addition to 
the 19 cities in New Jersey in which the free system has been adopted in full 3 cities fur- 
nish a part of the books used, and only 6 report no provision. In New York 18 of 67 
cities furnish books gratuitously, 2 furnish a part, and 1 city sells them to the children 
at cost. In Pennsyivania 10 cities furnish all books and 3 furnish a part. 
One hundred and three of the 115 cities are in the North Atlantic, 4 in the South 
Atlantic, and 8 in the North Central Division. The South Central and the Western Di- 
visions are enticely without representation in the list, which includes no city south of 
Portsmouth, Va.,'and none west of Eau Claire, Wis., excepting Omaha, Nebr. It may 
be said, therefore, that the practical application of the free text-book idea is confined 
1o the northeast quarter of the United States, and in'the northeast quarter of that 
quarter are found the great mass of its supporters. E    
THE WEALTH OF CITIES. 
One of the most important items to be considered in comparing the statistics of cities 
is the wealth of the city and its ability to support schools and other public institutions. 
To show this properly and in such a manner as to do justice to all concerned is an ever- 
-recurring problem. ‘The assessed value of all taxable property has been presented as an 
index to the cities’ wealth in all previous reports and also appears in Table 18 in this 
volume, but it is a well-known fact that the methods of ussessment differ so widely 
that little relianée can be placed in comparisons instituted upon such a basis, | 
For purposes of taxation it is immaterial whether property is assessed at its true value 
or any part thereof, provided that all is assessed at the same proportion of value. ‘The 
rate of taxation necessary to produce a given amount of revenue will vary inversely with 
the assessment, but the actual amount paid upon any piece of property will be unal- 
tered. Thus it happens that a ten-mill school tax in one city does not necessarily imply 
a weightier burden than a two-mill tax in another. But if no heavier taxation isshown 
by the higher rate, the item is worse than useless for statistical purposes, for it is mis- 
leading; and the same is true of the cause of the incongruity, the uncertain ‘‘assessed 
valuation.’’ But in order that there may be some test by which a city’s wealth may 
be judged more fairly than is possible with no other criterion than the varying assess- 
ment or the still more unreliable ‘‘estimate”’ as it is usually made, the form of inquiry 
recently sent out included a question by which the official basis of assessment in every 
case was obtained. 
The assumption is, of course, that there is always a definite plan pursued by the as- 
sessing officers, and that their valuation represents either a fair cash value of property 
or some uniform part thereof. Then, the assessor’s figures and the basis of assessment 
being given, it is a simple matter to find the true value of the property assessed. ‘Col-

ce OF HIGH SCHOOLS COMPARED WITH POPULATION. 
The sale table reveals ee interesting facts in relation to the 725 schools con- 
scoming which definite information is at hand:

High schools are relatively most numerous in the cities of the North Central Division 
and fewest in those of the North Atlantic Division. This does not necessarily mean 
that high-school advantages are more limited in the North Atlantic than in any other 
division, for in this, asin all other divisions but the Western, there are more schools than 
cities; but it is due to the fact that the cities, and conseyuently the schools themselves, 
are larger. The cities of New York and Philadelphia alone have as large a population % 
as all the: 91 cities reporting from, the South Atlantic and South Central Divisions com- 
bined, yet 5 high schools suffice for New York and paula Dat, while 109 are neces- 
sary for the 91 Southern cities. | f

CHARACTER OF. INSTRUCTION IN HIGH SCHOOLS. 
   Columns 12 to 16 in Table 16 were introduced to show the character of the instruction 
. imparted in the several schools. The information shown is not of the character to jus- 
- tify the formation of new opinions or startling conclusions of a general kind, forit simply 
brings further proof to the well-known fact that the great majority of high school students 
are about equally divided between the two principal courses that are practically the 
same the country over. For purposes of comparison between individual schools, and in 
judging the character of each, the columns are principally valuable. 
SEX OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. 
In: the column showing the number of high school graduates during the year, 543 cities 
are reported, showing a total of 11,970 persons graduated. Of this number 3,561 are’ 
males and 7,963 are females, the sex of 446 not being reported. Of those whose sex is 
known 30.9 per cent. are boys and,69.1 per cent. are girls. 
The small proportion of boys who finish the high school course is a matter of grave 
concern, which is worthy of the most serious consideration, especially since it isapparent 
that the proportion is decreasing. This tendency is conspicuously visible in the largest 
cities, It may be remarked in passing that not only is the proportion of high school 
pupils least in those cities,! butamong those who do reach the highest grades boys are 
relatively fewer in the large than in the smaller cities. In the ten great cities named ‘ 
in the table below the ratio of boys to the whole number of graduates in 1889 was 25.2 
per cent., 5.7 per cent. less than the same ratio for all of the cities,

“DECREASING PROPORTION OF MALE s Gnd pated, 
  To determine what has been the decrease in the relative number of males a table has 
been prepared, showing the number of male and of female graduates from the high 
schools of the ten principal cities during three periods of five years each, ending 1864, 
1869, and 1889, respectively. The last period is separated from the first two by sufii- 
cient interval to show the effect of causes constantly operating; each covers time-enough 
to avoid errors that might occur from considering results produced in a shorter time 
which might be the outcome of accidental, not permanent, causes; and finally, the cities. 
- taken are representatives of all sections of the country, so that the conclusions reached 
may notbe vitiated by a suspicion that the causes are to be found in purely local condi- 
_ tions. Prior to 1860 the records are not sufficient for general comparisons.

The large ratio of boys graduated during the first five years is all the more remark- 
able since notonly did a considerable number of boys actually leave school to enlist'in 
the military service, but it may be assumed that the absence of such numbers of men 
from their ordinary avocations necessitated by the civil war had the effect of increasing 
the demand for the services of youths of high school age both at their homes and in the 
industrial and business pursuits. It would have been natural to suppose, therefore, 
that the relative number of boys in the high schools would show an immediate increase 
' after the disbanding of the armies, and the resumption of their places in the peaceful 
callings by over a million of released soldiers. 
But the statistics bear witness that instead of an increase, the second five-year period 
shows a falling off of nearly 10 per cent., proving that the unreasonable and inexplica- 
ble custom that takes boys prematurely from the schools and puts them to work ill pre- 
pared for its exactions was even then tightening the grip whichit has held with increas- 
ing firmness ever since. 
In the third period, which embraces the present time, the girl graduates outnumber. 
the boys nearly three to one. The proportion of boys is largest in the cities of Cincin- 
nati, Ohio, and Boston, Mass., and smallest in Brooklyn, N. Y., where the girls ‘are 
more than eight times as many as the boys. |The greatest decrease is noticed in St. 
Louis, Mo., where from two boys to one girl in 1860-64 the proportion has changed to 
four girls to one boy during the last period. 
In Baltimore the decrease since 1865-69 is inconsiderable, and since 1860-64 there has 
been an actual gain. This is due principally to the establishment of the manual train- 
ing school, which has annually graduated a‘ large class of boys without affecting the 
popularity of the City College. A similar result may be seen in Philadelphia since the 
graduation of the first class from the manual training school there, for there has been 
no falling off in the number graduated from the Central High School, while the gradu- 
ates from the special school represent aclear gain. This does not immediately justify 
the conclusion that the solution of the question of the small proportion of boy graduates 
consists in the establishment of special schools to hold those who would ordinarily leave 
before the completion of the course, for even if it be granted that the end justifies the 
means the time that has elapsed has not been sufficient to show the ultimate effect of 
the special schools upon the older avd more orthodox institutions. But there can beno— 
doubt that the statistics so far are favorable to the advocates of the ‘‘mechanic-arts high 
schools.’? f

 Cohoes, N. Y., and Sidney, Ohio, report the discontinuance of the evening schools main- 
~ tained in 1887-88; and no information is givenin the reports and returns received in 
this office relating to such schools in Key West, Fla:, Muscatine, Iowa, Peabody, Mass., 
Harrisburg, Pa., New Castle, Pa., Wilkes Barre, Pa., and Oshkosh, Wis., all of which 
_ reported them last year. P ° 
One hundred and thirty-four cities now on our lists were included in the evening-school 
table in the last Report. The number represented in Table 17 herewith is greater by 
fifteen, hence twenty-eight cities report evening schools this year which did not report 
them in 1887-88. Theactual gain in the number of evening schools can not be positively 
stated, for it is impossible to say in how many of these twenty-eight cities this is the 
initial year, since some of them made no report last year, and the failure to mention 
evening schools in other cases may have been due simply to oversight on the part of 
reporting officers; this is known to be true in one or two instances. 
FALLING OFF OF ATTENDANCE AT EVENING SCHOOLS. 
An attempt was made to secure for this Report whatever exact data was available in 
relation to falling off in attendance which is a source of complaint in so many cities.’ 
No better questions for this purpose suggested themselves than those which appear at 
the head of columns 14 and 15in Table17. . Though the information obtained represents 
but afew cities, it clearly shows the grounds forthe complaint. In Chicago 9,189 pupils 
were enrolled during the whole six months’ term; 3,461 were present atthe opening and 
-only 1,297 at the closing session. The average number of evenings’ attendance of each 
‘pupil enrolled was 40, which is equivalent to three complete changes of personnel dur- 
ing the term. In Paterson, N. J., all but’ 43of the1,993 pupils enrolled entered at the 
beginning of the term and at the end of three months only one-fifth of them remained. 
The average of each pupil’s attendance in that city was twenty-one evenings or about 
one month. In Pawtucket, R. I., the schools were open five months and in that time 
practically three different sets of pupils were instructed, theayerage time of attendance 
of each pupil being twenty-eight evenings. At Milwaukee, Wis., 1,000 pupils were 
present at the opening and 1,488 came in as the term grew older, but the average daily 
_ attendance was only 886 and the number at the closing session was but 660. 
Mr. Donald L. Morrill, supervisor of evening schools of Chicago, thinks it ‘‘not un- 
reasonable to suppose that one-half the number enrolled can be kept in school for the 
greater part of the term,” and urges that ‘‘no effort be spared to attain that result at 
Jeast.’’ Even this low standard has been reached by considerably less than half the 
‘cities from which both the enrollment and daily attendance are reported, and if Mr. 
Morrill’s further assertion be true that it is safe to assume in general that the pupil 
who is interested enough to come to an evening school for a few weeks will remain for 
~ a longer time if he finds he is repaid for so doing, the statistics show a woful deliciency 
in the general quality of evening school instruction. 
UNSATISFACTORY CONDITION OF EVENING SCHOOLS. 
There is, in fact, very little that affords grounds for encouragement in the general 
system of evening school organization as it now prevails. ‘The day schools demand and 
obtain all that is best of the teaching profession, and it is a matter of pure chance if a 
thoroughly efficient teacher is found without permanent employment and willing to 
accept the hard work, poor pay, and uncertain tenure of an evening school position. 
_ As it is not considered judicious to allow day teachers to assume the extra burden of 
night work (though it is occasionally done), the consequence is that the care usually 
exercised in the selection of teachers is almost invariably relaxed when instructors for 
evening schools are to be appointed. The work to be done is rarely systematically laid 
out, and even the length of the term of each school is generally a matter left to be set- 
tled by the measure of success it attains. With a teacher picked up at haphazard and 
an air of uncertainty about everything connected with thé school its duration is natu- 
rally very short. . 
It is not surprising in view of these circumstances that there is a general indifference 
almost amounting to contempt on the part of the people toward evening schools, and a 
Jack of confidence in the value of the instruction tbey give; nor is it strange that they 
nue termed ‘‘educational luxuries that only wealthy cities can afford’? by men who un- 
loubtedly have the best interests of public education. at heart. 
The plain truth is that evening schools ought to be placed upon such a basis as will 
enable them to do creditable work or they ought to be abolished altogether. 
‘The latter would be a very serious mistake. The possibilities for good that they pre- 
sent are so great that to abandon them would be nearly as bad as to continue them ina 
state of inefficiency. 
   
-P-A-G-E-117
  @ffy scHooD sysTEMs. 
, But how to make them efficient, that is the question. Fortunately some of the cities 
have enjoyed a reasonable measure of success, and one of the best ways to improve de- 
fective systems is to examine the differences between the successful and the unsuccessful 
and adapt to the latter those features of the former which seem to have been the efficient © a 
causes of their success. With this in view the following suggestions are made, based 
upon the experience of cities at least moderately successful inthe management of even- 
ing schools. , - 
A MORE DEFINITE PLAN NEEDED. | i 
The thing which seems to be most urgently needed and which is most frequently lack- 
ing is a well-defined course of study and the careful classification which it encourages or 
necessitates. It is but natural that one can work to better effect and take a greater 
interest in doing that work when the whole task is set beforehim. He understands ex- 
actly what he must do to complete it and he realizes that. each day and each month 
brings him that much nearer the accomplishment of the end he desires to gain. Should 
he look back he sees that progress has been made, and the consciousness that past efforts 
have been fruitful spurs him on to greater efforts in mastering the portion that remains, 
This is one of the offices of the course of study in the schools. Without it an evening 
school lacks a stimulus far more effective than a ‘‘dollar deposit ’’ or a compulsory 
statute, for it involves motives higher than avarice or mere physical obedience to law. 
A course of study is as necessary to a school as a chart is toa ship, It is justasreason- 
able to expect a sailor to stick to a vessel drifting here and there without a port in view 
or definite means of reaching one as to expect a pupil to continue in a school without a 
plan. No matter how eager a yonng man may be to ‘' get an education,’’ his enthusiasm 
is apt to be intermittent and his efforts irregular and spasmodic unless his vague eager- 
ness for ‘an education’? can be crystallized into a desire to accomplish a certain well- 
@efined work which will give that measure of mental development which means to him 
‘‘an education.”? ‘ 
In 1888 a systematic course of instruction was introduced in all the Boston evening 
schools, and the benefits that have resulted justify all that has been said above, as the 
following paragraph from the last report of the committee on evening schools shows: 
“These courses of study have proved of the greatest benefit to the schools. The in: 
creased interest shown by the pupils in having some definite work to do and some defi- 
nite end to reach has been very marked. The classifications of the pupils rendered 
possible under the courses of study will assist to a very great degree toward the success — 
ot these schools. 
+The course of study for the evening ‘elementary schools provides for instruction init 
English language, arithmetic, bookkeeping, geography, history and civil government, 
physiology, and hygiene.’ 
THE LENGTH OF THE EVENING-SCHOOL TERM. 
The next serious defect in the evening-school system has already been incidentally 
‘mentioned, and relates to the shortness of the time for which they are annually in ses- 
sion. The fact that the term is too short to offer an inducement to capable teachers is 
an important consideration, but it is still more important that the time is not sufficient 
for the instruction to result in solid acquirement or lasting benefit to even the most 
earnest and faithful of the pupils. 3 
In any school teachers must become acquainted with their charges, and pupils must 
grow accustomed to schoolroom discipline before substantial work can be done. This 
is particularly true of evening schools, for their pupils are as a rule unused to restraint 
and do not readily adapt themselves to conditions so entirely different from their life 
outside the schoolroom. The time thus occupied in bringing the school down to a 
working basis must be considered as virtually lost, so far as actual instruction is con- 
cerned, and by so much lessens the real length of the school term. Then,-if this term 
covers but a few weeks as is generally the case, the time for closing comes when the 
more earnest pupils have just begun to acquire habits of effective study and to do sat- 
isfactory work ; and the little good accomplished is dissipated and the ambition aroused 
in the pupils is lost during their long absence from school influences. All teachers 
know that even in day schools in the comparatively short summer vacation of two 
months much of the work of the previous ten months is lost and must be repeated after 
the reassembling of the children in the autumn, Then, prolong the ‘‘vacation” to” 
nine months and shorten the school term to twelve weeks and the daily session to three 
hours, and how much of the benefits of one term would be apparent the next? If a 
ten months’ term is no more than ordinary day schools require for good work why should 
other schools be expected to perform the same kind of work satisfactorily if they have

only one-third as iss time? If it is important to keep day schools open almost con- 
- tinuously in order that the period of youth may be utilized to the fullest extent for 
education, is it not more important that persons approaching maturity without having 
enjoyed the advantages of early instruction should have the opportunity to secure the 
greatest possible amount of training while they are inclined. to receive it and before 
time and circumstances effectually put an end to all hope of further schooling ? 
But, it may be said, pupils can not be induced to attend even for the short time, and it 
would be folly to keep the schools open longer, for there would be no pupils. 
Such a fear is not founded on experience. On the contrary, the statistics prove it to 
be groundless. In San Francisco the schools were open 193 nights, or about 10 months, 
‘and the per cent. of attendance as compared with the total enrollment was larger or not 
materially less than in Chicago with 117 nights; St. Paul, 120 nights; Omaha, 90 nights; 
Paterson, 56 nights; New York, 90 nights; Pawtucket, 94 nights; Milwaukee, 57 nights, 
Furthermore, the attendance the first night was less than one hundred greater than 
that of the last night, and theaverage attendance for the term was nearly the same, in- 
dicating a singular uniformity in the size of the schools throughout the year. Smaller 
cities that maintained evening schools through practically the whole school year were 
Oakland, Cal., 191 evenings; San José, Cal., 180 evenings; Salem, Mass., 180 evenings; 
and Providence, R. I., 190 evenings. There is nothing in the statistics of these cities to 
indicate that they were without pupils during the fall and summer months. 
This is not incomprehensible. It is only what may be reasonably expected in any 
- city. It is natural that a promise ofa course long enough to produce substantial results 
will attract a class of persons who would be less likely to attend a school, lasting only 
three months, in which they have little or no confidence. These persons, being earnest 
in their desire for improvement, form the mainstay of such a school and receive the lion’s 
share of its benefits. Others may come in for a time for no good purpose, just as in 
schools with shorter sessions, but being scattered through a longer time they are rarely 
present in considerable numbers at one time, and hence form less of a disturbing ele- 
ment. For the same reason the size of the school varies-less, a point of advantage not 
to be overlooked. It may also be urged as an objection against longer terms that even- 
ing schools are more expensive than other schools, and it would cost too much to main- 
tain them throughout the full school year. There can be no doubt that evening schools 
open the full time would require more money than is at present spent upon them, butis it 
not better to apply a hundred dollars to an effective purpose than to waste ten dollars 
without result, which is practically what many cities are doing? High schools, too, 
cost more than elementary day schools, yet no one would propose to cut down the high- 
school term to four or five months, aud abandon them to such teachers as could be ob- 
* tained for that short time, simply because they are expensive. The fact is realized 
that high schools are necessary, and the outlay needed to keep them at a high point of 
efficiency is made without a question. So it should be with evening schools. If they 
are necessary, they should be supported on a basis more nearly approaching that of day 
schools; if they are not necessary, there is no excuse for their continuance. 
' Pusiic KINDERGARTENS. 
The ideal relation of the kindergarten to the public-school system is that all pupils 
may receive one or two years of pure, or nearly pure, kindergarten instruction before 
_ entering the lowest grade of the regular primary school. In other words, the first or re- 
ceiving class in all the schools should be a kindergarten. This ideal condition has not 
been realized so far in any city, although that is the end toward which the efforts of the 
last few years tend.

D.—THE record OF comPantanty STATISTICS. Libra 
The remarks upon page 768 relating tothe uses and value of the summarized tables of © 
comparative statistics apply with equal force to tables 20 and 21. They are to the in- 
_ dividual cities what tables 12 and 13 are to sets of cities. Naturally in these tables ap- 
ear anomalies more remarkable and inequalities more noticeable than are brought out 
iy ‘tables 12 and 13, for the peculiarities of single cities disappear to a great extent when 
they are merged or combined to make an aggregate with others which do not possess 
the same characteristics. ‘Thesé wide differences are indicative of the varied conditions ~ 
under which the work of education in America is conducted. There are cities of all 
degrees of wealth, varying from the suburban settlement of mill operatives whose whole 
- number of taxable dollars is only 581 times as great as the number of children to be 
_ provided for, to the elegant and fashionable home for a great city’s wealthy men whose 
ageregated ownings would be sufficient to give every resident child of elementary school 
age the snug sum of $27,206. There are cities that have set aside for purely educa- 
- tional purposes property worth more than 5 per cent. of the value of all the taxable 
‘property they contain and cities in which the schools fare less than one-tenth as well. 
‘There are cities which pay to teachers and supervisors over $30 for each child in attend- 
ance, and others’ which pay less than $5 for similar service. There are cities which i 
provide accommodations for nearly twice as many pupils as there are children’ under 
fourteen, and others which provide seats for less than one-third the number that would 
ordinarily be expected to be in school. 
With such differences in not only the provision for schools, butin the ability to provide 4 
for them, it is not to be expected that the quantity and quality of work will even ap- 
proach uniformity, and the generalizer who declaims of the ‘universal excellence of 
the schools of the American cities” would do well to study the statistics and revise his 
opinion. Are those good schools i in which less than half the pupils enrolled attend regu- 
larly? Can those systems lay any just claim to excellence in which the children remain 
in school on an average less than five months? Yeta glance through the table shows 
that such schools and such systems are by no means rare. 
There is still a great deal of room for Bray on yn We have not yet reached the 
- point of perfection.

   NEW SCHOOLS. 
\ Me 
In three States the legislature has provided for a new normal school. Colorado 
calls into existence her first school, Connecticut her second, and New York her tenth 
' in addition to putting the sixty or seventy normal classes of the academies under the 
control of the State superintendent, who intends to transform them into veritable 
training classes for the education of teachers as far as may be done with schools — 
having so short a session. |The school at Slippery Rock, Pa., and that for colored 
’- teachers at Montgomery, Ala., have been opened under favorable circumstances. 
ise. 
THE COLORADO SCHOOL, Rea 
Section 1 of the act creating a State normal school in Colorado reads as follows: 
* “A State normal school is hereby established at or near the city of Greeley, the 
purpose of which shall be instruction in the science and art of teaching, with the aid 
of a suitable practice department, and in such branches of knowledge as shall qualify — 
_ teachers for their profession: Provided, That a donation shall be made of a site forsaid — 
State normal school, consisting of forty acres of land, with a building erected thereon, — 
according to plans and specifications furnished by the State board of education, and 
to cost not less than $25,000, $10,000 of which shall be paid by the State, as herein- 
after provided.” ; ae 
The school is to be under the control of a board of six trustees appointed by the — 
‘governor for a term of six years, the terms of two expiring every two years, who — 
hhaye also general supervision, control, and direction of its funds. They appoint ~ 
the faculty and fix their salaries, and with the advice and consent of the faculty 
prescribe the various books to be used in the school, the courses of study and instruc- 
tion (which shall in no case have fewer than three years), make all needful rules a 
regulations, and fix the qualifications for admission. Ae 
__ Every applicant for admission shall undergo an examination by the faculty, and if 
_the applicant is not of good character or fails to pass he is to be rejected.. The school 
is open to all persons sixteen years of age or more who are are residents of the State, 
and to nonresidents ‘‘upon payment of a rate of tuition to be fixed by the board.” 
. To enable residents to receive tuition free they must have signed (and filed with the 
board of trustees) a declaration ‘‘to engage in the business of teaching in the public 
schools of this State.” 
Diplomas are granted to such students as have completed the full course of instruc- 
- tion and have been recommended by the faculty after having passed an examination — 
conducted by a board composed of the State superintendent of public instruction, a 
county superintendent of schools within the State, and the principal. When a certi~ 
fied copy of this has been filed in the office of the superintendent of the county ~ 
wherein the holder designs to teach, the holder is licensed to teach in any of the — 
public schools of the State. 5 a 
The trustees are to make an annual report, which is to include, among other mat- 
ters, ‘‘the attendance each day, the average attendance for each week and term, and 
uring the year, the full curriculum of instruction in said school, the classification — 
qnd departments thereof, the branches taught, time devoted to each, text-books and 
apparatus in use, requirements for admission and graduation.” iy x 
In addition to the $10,000 appropriated for buildings, an additional $10,000 is pro- 
vided by the State for furnishing them. ‘ i Dies

  954 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888 89. 
ery, THE CONNECTICUT SCHOOL Av’ WILLIMANTIC. 
The acts creating a second State normal school and locating it at Willimantic were 
passed in 1889. Section 1 of the organic act relates that ‘‘ The State board of educa- 
tion shall maintain two normal schools as seminaries for training teachers in the art of 
instructing and governing in the public schools of the State, one of which shall be 
located east of the Connecticut River [the one already established being west of the 
Connecticut], and such sum as the State board of education may in each year deem 
necessary for their support, not exceeding in any year $40,000 in the aggregate, shall 
be annually paid therefor from the treasury of the State on the order of the said 
board. The appointment and general management of teachers is under the control 
of State board, as also the finances. 
Tuition is gratuitous and the regulations for admission and the number of pupils 
are fixed by the State board. The candidates for admission are selected by the school 
visitors of each town, and must file with the board a written declaration ‘‘ that their 
object in securing admission to such school is to become, qualified to teach in public 
schools, and that they intend to teach in the public schools of this State.” 
The State board may establish and maintain model schools. 
By a subsequent act the school was located at Willimantic, and $75,000 appro- 
priated for its establishment. This appropriation, however, did not become availa- 
ble until the township of Windham had furnished a satisfactory site and had agreed 
to furnish ‘‘suitable and sufficient school buildings and model ana practice schools 
in connection with the training department of said normal school.” 
THE NEW YORK SCHOOL AT PLATTSBURGH. 
By ‘an act to establish anormal and training school at the village of Plattsburgh” 
it is related that— 
SEcTION 1. There shall be established at the village of Plattsburgh, in the county 
of Clinton, a normal and training school: Provided, however, and upon the condition, 
That within one year from the passage of this act a suitable site shall be conveyed 
to the State for said institution, to be approved and accepted by the commission- 
ers. *. 
Sxc. 2, Upon the acceptance of such conveyance, the superintendent of public 
instruction shall appoint a local board of managers for such school, consisting of not 
less than three persons. * * * 
Sre. 3. Upon the appointment of such boardof managers, there shall be erected 
upon such site suitable buildings for such normal and training school * * * at 
an expense not to exceed $60,000, 
THE TRANSFER OF THE TRAINING CLASSES IN THE ACADEMIES AND UNION SCHOOLS 
OF NEW YORK FROM THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS TO THAT OF 
THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
The board of regents of the University of New York was established in 1784, and 
reorganized with power to incorporate colleges and academies in 1787. The office of 
State superintendent was created in 1813 and abolished in 1821 and reéstablished in 
1854. The regents in 1834 established classes for the training of teachers in the acad- 
emies, and in 1844 the deputy secretary of state having cognizance of school affairs: 
and the regents were jointly charged with the management of the first State normal 
school. By the act recreating his office in 1854 the State superintendent became a 
member of the board of regents, and by an act of the following year that board was 
authorized to prescribe a course of study for teachers’ classes in academics. The nor- 
mal schools proper, with the exception of the first, have ever been under the charge 
of the State superintendent. In 1870 a bill making the regents subordinate to the 
superintendent was vetoed by the governor, since which the two educational author- 
ities of the State have been superintending the training of teachers each in its own 
sphere. We have given the State superintendent's solution of the difficulty on pages 
437-8 of our 1887-88 report as far as it relates to normal schools and classes. In the 
sequel the solution recently made by the legislature will be given. The matter is 
quotedfrom the 1+90 report of the State superintendent, Mr. Draper, being his ‘‘ regu- 
Jations and course of study for the training classes in the academies and union schools 
of the State,” of June 15, 1889. 
“Teachers who have had experience in the instruction of training classes in the 
academies and union schools of the State have felt that a great advance would be 
attained if a uniformity of subjects pursued by these classes could be secured and a 
uniform standard of examination could be reached. The accomplishment of these 
advantages has been reached by an act of the legislature (chapter 137 of the laws of 
1889), transferring the management and supervision of these classes to the superin-

‘ize the work with other instrumentalities of the State for the qualification of ¢ 
- mon-school teachers. 
“Tn the instructions which follow, an effort has been made to secure these results 
Attention is therefore called to the. en which have been made to the regulations” 
- which have been adopted and to the syllabus for uniform study and examination. _ 
“I. Appointments.—To receive dueconsideration applications for an appointment to 
instruct a class should be forwarded to the department of public instruction by th 
ist of July for the ensuing year. In making assignments to institutions, reference 
will be given to the following considerations: (1) The proper distribution of the 
classes among the counties of the State. (2) The location of the class to accommo- 
date the greatest number of suitable candidates. (3) Such equipment of the institu 
tion as will give assurance of doing substantial work, both in the theory and practice 
of teaching. A blank form of application will be furnished to institutions Tequest-— 
ing the same. 
“The funds paid by the State for this instruction go to the management of the 
institution and not to any individual. Trustees [of an academy] who pay a fixed sal 
ary to their principal are requested not to allow teachers to share in this fund as an 
extra compensation. Where this is done it will be considered as sufficient Bros for 
discontinuing the assignment. 
TT, Qualifications Sor admission.—(1) Candidates must have attained the age of six- 
teen years, (2) They must subscribe in good faith to the following declaration, and 
the trustees, principal, and school commissioner must be satisfied that the candi: 
dates have the moral character, talents, and aptness necessary to success in teacl 
ing: ‘We the subscribers, hereby declare that our object in asking admission to th 
training class is to prepare ourselves for teaching i in the public schools of this State, 
and that it is ourintention to become teachers.’ (3) Before admission they must pat 
the examination for third grade license [v. p. 438, 1887-88 Report of U, 8. Bu. of Ed. 
under the State uniform examination ; or hold the: regents’ preliminary certifica’ 
and a pass-card in physiology. (4) No applicant can be admitted to the privileges 
of the class who can not comply with all the conditions prescribed and devote the 
requisite time to the special work of the class. 
“TIT, Organization.—(1) The class organized under.the appointment must consist 
of not less than ten members and must be instructed for a period of not less than i 
ten or more than thirteen weeks.. Institutions will receive $1 for each week’sin- 
struction of each member, and the whole number of weeks allowed each class must — 
not exceed 250. * * * (2) As one term does not afford sufficient time to accom- 
plish the amount of instruction and training desirable to meet, the progressive 
demands of the teaching service, on that account those institutions, having ample 
facilities and a good record in the grade and character of the instruction, may receiv 
an appointment to instruct two classes during the year. (3) To secure the most 
promising candidates the following information should be fully announced some tim 
prior to the organization of the class: The time when the class is to be organized, 
conditions of membership, the character and advantages of a professional course of — 
study, the importance of this work in securing teachers’ certificates. * * * (5) Two 
periods of forty-five minutes each every school day must_be employed in the instruc- — 
tion on the topics laid down in course of study, Outside of the time given for this * 
separate instruction, such members of the class as have time and ability may be al- — 
lowed to pursne such other subjects in the school curriculum as will be most prose: 
able, for which, however, no tuition may be charged. - < 
“TV. Course of study.—The following course of study is prescribed upon the advice 9 
of a committee of principals representing the union schools and the academies of the 
State. This committee met, after consultation with the normal-school principals, 
and devised a plan of study. which is intended to harmonize with the normal-school 
work and the uniform examination for teachers’ certificates,

ysiology. Part of the time given to these topics must be spent in observation 
ice work under the direction of the instructor of the class, acting as critic 
One of the considerations specially noted in granting the application was — 
16 opportunity afforded for observation and practice work, and it is insisted that 
© opportunities be improved. The training class must be also a practice class. 
ddition to receiving the methods of teaching on the authority of the instractor 
is very important that the members should be trained how to observe critically 
to intelligently interpret the principles of teaching by being brought in contact 
with the pupils in the actual work of imparting instruction. To afford this training 
is expected that the critic teacher, at least twice a week, will give an opportunity 
to witness practical work, either by taking the class to other departments of the 
shool to observe the work of experienced teachers, or by bringing pupils from other 
artments to receive from the critic teacher a model lesson. In addition, it is 
_ recommended that each member be given actual work in teaching asoften as consistent 
_ with the work of the school. At a subsequent recitation let this observation and 
tice work be reviewed by the critic teacher, the underlying principles clearly 
‘ought out and the proper methods forcibly presented. ‘The time devoted to the ob- 
vation work, and the criticisms on the work, will be accounted part of the regu- 
aily periods of class instruction. 
Very much depends upon the instructor of these.classes whether the instruction 
practice drill are of a proper grade and character. The number of graduates 
sent out each year from our normal schools, the departments of pedagogical study in- _ 
stituted in some of our colleges, and the formation of summer schools for the special 
surpose of studying the best methods of teaching, are ample to furnish competent 
ad thoroughly trained teachers to take charge of the classes. Duty to the common 
schools demands thoroughly trained teachers for this work. If the inspector in hi 
itation of these classes shall find any person in charge of the instruction who is 
not qualified by professional study or experience to properly conduct the class, he is 
instructed to report the fact to the superintendent, who will annul the appointment 
to instruct such a class.” : 
_ The superintendent gives the syllabus of the course, but as this is very minute in 
_ its directions, covering eight pages, we are obliged to refer those who desire to - 
_ study it to the superintendent’s report for 1890. 
_ For the fall term of 1889, sixty-one institutions were designated to instruct a class, 
_ of which twelye failed to organize for lack of a sufficient number to satisfy the ad- 
iced requirements for admission, For the forty-nine that organized, the follow- 
1g statistics are given: A aft

  The above figures show a diminished attendance as compared with the operation of _ 
toe classes under the former order of things; but ‘a very gratifying advance in 
he grade of scholarship and the general maturity of the membership.” The loss in 
ndance is attributed by the inspector, Professor Hawkins, to the advance in the 
standard for admission, the increased time demanded for study, and the greater ease 
aining a second-grade certificate by examination immediately than by going “ 
through the course in order to obtain it. :

STaTIsTIcs OF NORMAL SCHOOLS AS REPORTED FOR 1888-89. 
Until 1887 the questions fied on the iaak forms of inquiry annually sent out b 
this Bureau regarding the scholastic character of the attendance at the normal 
schools of the country were these: 
9. Number of different normal students i in attendance during the last school year: Male, —— 
10, Number of other students of bp-ataorondary. or high-school grade in attendance during the last school 
year:b Male, ; femalo, U1. Is thor a model school attached to the institution?   
  
In the following year (1888) the form was changed to enable the Bureau to ascer- 
tain what number were actually being trained for teaching. The inquiry as to 
attendance was now couched in the following terms: . 
5. Number of different students enrolled within the year:* Male,   
  
  
    
    
        7. Number in teachers’ training course: Male, female, total, . 8. Average daily attendance of normal pupils: Male, ; femal ; total, §. Number below the academic or high-school grade: ¢ Male, ; female,   
1. Number receiving special training for kindergartens, 12. Number im commercial course: Male, ; female, 13. Number of pupils taught in practice training school,   
    
; total,   
  
a By referring to p. 956 it will be seen that for the first session 1869-90, 748 pupils were enrolled in ve the teachers’ training classes in the academies and union schools of New "York, a decrease, The sta- tistics of the above table are for 1888-89; but of the 424 students in the North Atlantic Division, onl 309 are for New York. In other words, it must be remembered that the statistics of the above ‘table are for cities of 4,000 inhabitants and over. 
b The answer to this question should not include students in the model department when such sta. dents are below the secondary or high-school grade. $ ¢ Not including pupils in practice training school. a *

     PUBLIC NORMAL SCHOOLS. ‘ 
Attendance.—During 1888-89 it appears from the following table that 22,618 persons’ 
© pursuing a course, of study in the science and art of teaching in the 129 schools 
which report themselves as having such students. Ofthesestudents 71 in every hun- 
dred were women, a sight increase over the percentage of 1887-88, when 112 schools 
reported. themselves as having students in a ‘‘teachers’ training class.” If wedivide 
the number of students in the science and art of teaching by the number of schools 
ce reporting themselves as having such students during 1488-89 we find that forthe year 
under review (1848-89) there were 175 students to each of the 129 schools reporting. _ 
‘or 1887-83 there were but 154 to each of the 112 schools reporting for that year. t     
    During the year under review there were 28,092 pupils in 124 schools whose statis- 
tics may be used, or 228 students to each school. During the preceding year there — 
were 243 students to the 133 schools whose statistics were used. In the 123 schools _ 
for 1888-89, 70 per cent. of the attendance were women, a slight increase over the per- 
_ centage of 1887-88, when it was 69 per cent. : 
_ Pwenty schools report 1,216 students under kindergarten training, and 56 report 
; a ‘0 students in secondary studies, but in some cases these secondary students appear

Income.—The income from public sources considered as a total for the whole coun- 
try shows but a small increase. The receipts from other sources given in the follow: 
ing table can not be compared with the total of a similar column in the report 
preceding this. In that the general question was asked, ‘‘Aid from other sources 
_Yeceived within the year?” and the answers tabulated. In the present report the 
“Bureau has computed the item from data given in answer to a series of questions. — 
The amount expended for building and repairs is a new item and in several cases is os 
included in one of the two other columns of Table 3. It will be observed that prima —_ 
_ facie about one-third of the amount received was expended in buildings and repairs, 
' but the fallacy of such figuring is easily shown by taking the case of the new school 
at Chico where the appropriation was $29,000, while the amount expended on build- 
‘ings was $100,000, The State normal school at ‘ramingham, Mass., expended $115, 000, 
and the new school at Oneonta, N. Y., $114,000; in the case of the Massachusetts 
school the appropriation for the year was $14,000, while no appropriation for the isan 
1888-89 seems to have been made for the New York school,

1e separation of this class of institutions into two divisions has been found to 
rk a ite successfully. It is hoped that a greater number of institutions wi. 
dually raise their standards sufficiently to be included in Division A of Table 
one that has been added to this division since the publication of the Re 
-88 is Mount Holyoke aa and College, aoe Hadley, Mass., w! 
lately been granted a charter, and now possesses fall collegiate powers. ° aS 
| number of institutions included in Table 2 is 198, which is 9 less than were 
rted in 1887-88. ‘This decrease in numbers is due, very likely, to failureonthe — 
these institutions to report their statistics. ead i wen

SCHOOLS OF cIENCE ENDOWED BY THE Nationar Lanp, GRANT. . i > \        
         Only thirty-two of the forty-eight schools properly reported under this head appear 
in Table 13." Of the other sixteen schools, the South Georgia College of Agriculture _ 
nd Mechanic Arts Thomasville, Ga., has made no report to this Office since ~ 
1es5-86, and does therefore not appear in the table. The College of Agriculture and. 
Mechanic Arts of the University of North Carolina has been abolished and a new 
school, the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts has been located 
i Raleigh, under the presidency of Alexander Q. Holliday. No report was received | 
‘om it, as its first session ene on October 3, 1889. The remaining fourteen schools 
i ith the institutions of which they are departments that it is 
‘ t r i uplication, so that the statistics — 
of these schools are reported in Table 7, with the institutions to which they belong. _ 
Remarks on Table 8.—From the summary given in Table 8, it appears that the total 
number of professors and instructors reported by the thirty-two schools was 670, 
which is an increase of 8.06 per cent. over the number reported in 1887-88, while the 
_ increase in the namber of students is 18.38 per cent. The total income reported by 
_ these schools is $1,407,242, of which amount 37.4 per cent. was derived from State or 
municipal appropriations, 40.95 per cent. from productive funds, and 15.98 per cent. 
_ from tuition fees, leaving a small portion unaccounted for. Comparing these per-_ 
/ centages with the corresponding percentages of the previous year, we find that the — 
ercentage of income derived from appropriations in 1588-89 exceeds that for 1887-88 
“by 4.47 per cent., and that for 1886-87 by 4.45 per cent. . 
Of the total amount received from tuition fees, 68.96 per cent. is reported by the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and 17.11 per cent. by Cornell University, 
ile the remaining 13.93 per cent. is distributed in small amounts among thirteen vi 
institutions. ‘ A 
The number of institutions of this class maintaining preparatory departments is _ 
Iegite bragghe. he ar affording more time and means to the instruction in col-     
    
      
    
       
  legiate branches. The Maryland Agricultural College, in its catalogue for 1888-89, ie 
states that the public educational facilities are believed to be such in all parts of the 
state as to render it unnecessary for the college to maintain a preparatory depart-

As these ratios virtually represent the entire growth of the schools, a similar scheme 
of tabulation (Table 9) has been prepared for this SEnUEG: pel for basis the infor- 
mation received in the years 1883- 84 and 1888-99. 
The greatest ratio of increase in instructors is feported by Purdue University, i in 
which institution the increase is 200 percent. The decrease in the number of students _ 
in the five institutions reporting a decrease is due, wety probably, to the reorganiza-- ¥2 
tion of the institutions. -

            DISTRIBUTION OF STUDENTS IN PRACTICAL WORK, 
Table 10 represents, as far as possible, the distribution of students of the land- grant 
colleges in the various lines of practical work afforded by the institutions. This rep- 
resentation is very incomplete, owing to the failure of many of thé institutions to — 
answer the inquiries on this subject. The table is an important one, for it shows not 
only the extent to which students avail themselves of the opportunities for practical 
training afforded them, but, taken in connection with similar tables in previous re- 
ports, it shows in which of these lines of ee work the institutions are develop-

ed, “What proportion of the graduates of the land- 
‘iculture and the mechanicatts?” Theendeavoris    
   peer ie 4 rae 
The question is frequently ee 
nt colleges are engaged in ag 
ere made to present in tabular form the data bearing upon this inquiry, Consider- 
able difficulty has been experienced in collecting t rained statistics, as many of. 
the institutions do not publish a list of their alumni, while some publish a list with- 
out giving the occupations; altogether 14 land-gran Pray neons areincludedin the 
‘scheme (Table 12). te t : ex : ide _ The total number of living graduates of these 14 institutions is 4,261, of which 
number the occupations of 417 are unknown, leaving 3,844 to be accounted for, Per- 
_ haps it would be well to note that a large proportion of those included under the = 
head “unknown” are reported as being with manufacturing companies, railroads, 
_ etc., but no definite occupation is mentioned. Of the total number distributed 1,691 _ 
or 44 per cent. of ti raduates are engaged in agriculture and mechanic arts or in 
occupations allied to them. Taking the table in detail we tind that 8.3 per cent. are 
engaged in farming, 6.06 per cent. in land-grant colleges and agricultural experi- __ 
ment stations, 14.75 per cent. are engaged in engineering; 2.45 per cent. in architec- : 
ture, 2.89 per cent. in manufactures, 2.16 per cont. as chemists, 1.93 per cent. as 
superintendents, 1.59 per cent. as draughtsmen, 1.48 per cent. as professors in col- 
leges, 1.53 per cent. as editors, 4.84 per cent. as physicians, 1.53 per Gent. as clergy- 
“men, 3.77 per cent. are students, 10.33 per cent. are teachers, including superinten- i 
dents of schools, 11.29 per cent. are lawyers, and 9.29 per cent. are in business, 
leaving 15.81 per cent. distributed in several other occupations. ? . 
_ Considering the second part of the table, i. e., those schools not endowed by the 
land grant, we find the total number of graduates is 1,999, of whom only 56.73 per 
cent. are engaged in technical occupations, Taking into consideration the fact that, ag 
with ore exception, all-the institutions included in the second part of the table are. eos 
_ purely technological schools, and that five of the institutions in the first part of the 
table also maintain classical and literary courses of study, the showing made by the 
latter class is very good in comparison with that of the technological schools not en- 
dowed by the land grant. 3

MANUAL TRAINING. ° 
  
4 
The very full consideration given the statistics of manual training in our last re- 
. port leaves no occasion, after so short an interval, to do more than present the statis- _ 
tics that the Bureau has since been able to obtain. 
It would be unreasonable to expect that the Bureau’s list of systems having 
introduced manual training is exhaustive, for the system introducing manual train- 
ing is under no obligation to spontaneously and immediately report the fact to the 
Bureau, nor, in many cases, does the Bureau know the fact until long afterwards 
inrongy the medium of a printed city school report or a periodical. Equally unjust 
would it be to manual training, therefore, to claim that our figures show its condi- 
tion, statistically speaking, with the greatest possible completeness. 
: In conclusion it is to be said that very frequently information arrives that such 
and such a system has introduced manual training. A blank form is sent to that 
system on the strength of this. But it is returned with a note to the effect that the 
manual training the system has is calisthenics, or drawing merely, ete., from which it 
ey be inferred that the connotation of the term manual training is not everywhere 
e same, f :

   Returns have been received from 197 institutions during the past year, and the 
statistics of 36 institutions have been taken from ‘the Bureau’s Report of 1887-88, 
making a total of 233, an increase of 11 over the previous year. There has been an 
increase of 86 instructors and 7,183 pupils; 11 schools are reported for the first time. 
The number of pupils in the business departments of colleges and secondary 
schools during the past year has fallen off to a considerable extent, and a correspond- 
ing increase in the cazolient of business colleges is shown in the statistical tables. 
Twenty-nine per cent. of these institutions did not send any information to this 
Bureau for the current year. Complete statistics are necessary in order to represant 
the work done by the colleges. But as it frequently happens that colleges are estab- 
_ lished without being reported to the Bureau, it is quite probable that there are insti- 
tutions in the country which are not on the list. If the colleges that co not appear 
will but send notice of their existanee, a blank form will be forwarded. 
It appears from a careful reading of the catalogues and returns sent by these 
institutions that the time required for a course of business training depends upon 
the natural aptitude of the student and the extent and completeness with which he 
wishes to qualify himself. From four to six months is the usual time necessary to 
complete the full business course ; stenography, telegraphy, and typewriting require 
- from three to four months each. In some of the colleges a collegiate course of four 
_ years has beenadded. In others special emphasis is laid upon mathematics, in which 
_ the student is rigidly examined before graduation. 
During the past year the Bureau has received letters from several persons stating 
_ that, as the statistics of neighboring colleges had been falsified, they would not send 
those of their own. institutions. This is a very embarrassing subject to discuss; the 
__. Bureau has no means of rectifying the statements it receives, and they are necessarily 
_ published as they are furnished. 
The increase of the business colleges of the country has kept pace with the increase ~ 
_ of population and with the growth of the business enterprises during the last ten 
years. Since 1880 the estimated increase in the number of colleges is 83 per cent.; 
of instructors, 173 per cent.; and of pupils, 115 per cent. — 
Improvements have also been made in the courses of study, and in the manner of 
preparing pupils for the responsible positions they seek to fill after leaving or gradu- 
ating from the institutions. The most of the colleges give the student practical 
_' knowledge of how business is transacted in the large cities in banking, in insur- 
‘ance, in real estate, and in commercial houses. If the student is far enough ad- 
vanced in mathematics and in the English branches, very little attention is given to 
_ text books. In the college building are found the college bank, with its president 
and board of directors, cashier, and tellers; the jobbing house and the commission 
house, and the insurance and the one offices. The student before finishing    
   his course is required act as cashier, paying teller, receiving teller, shipping 
clerk, salesman, cashier, and bookkeeper. The student buys and sells, makes depos- 
its, draws checks, and sustains the same general relation to the college bank and to 
the jobbing house that is held by a merchant in the great business world. He is 
also given instruction in the modus operandi of the insurance office, and is taught 
_ by the real-estate broker how to estimate the increased value of real estate by the 
_ increase of population and by the laws of supply and demand. 
As the business of the country has enlarged and expanded, the knowledge of com- 
mercial law, of commercial calculations, and of the tariff laws of different nations 
has become a necessity, and business men are coming to demand a thorough practical 
eaupapon in all these br: . ches before employing young men as their business assist- 
ants. —

. The education of the business man in all that appertains to business life is as 
essential as the education of the professional man in all that appertains to profes- 
sional life, His attainments, his powers, and his manhood are laid under contribu- 
tion, and without a thorough and practical business education he is like a ship at 
sea without compass or rudder. ‘ me 
When students were taught only the theories of business and were given only an 
indistinct outline of business forms, and the merchant found them unable to do the. 
‘work of the office, his conclusions were that business colleges could not, or did not, 
educate them properly for active business life. These objections have been met in a 
practical manner by the introduction of practical business departments in the insti- 
tutions, and by the employment of intelligent teachers that were once active busi- 
ness men having a practical knowledge of business forms. 
The apprenticeship system has passed away, and with it the prejudice against, 
and the ignorance of, a business education in a business college.

  CHAPTER XXXI. 
NURSES’ TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
REMARKS ON THE STATISTICS, 
As compared with the Report for 1887-88 the figures for the year under review 
show an increase of 145 pupils and 103 graduates. The corpsof instruction is a diffi- 
cult thing to define. In some instances the hospital staff has been returned as such, 
while in other instances the corps has been returned as composed of one or two in- 
structors. Nine institutions report the ‘amount received from students at private 
nursing.” The amount received from this source was’ $21,395. 
As to the text-books used there can be no doubt that Clara Weeks’s Text-book on 
Nursing is a favorite, for in sixteen instances it is reported as being in use, In five 
instances Gray’s Anatomy is used. There seems to be no set of text-books generally 
used in these schools, each school adopting its own combination irrespective of what 
books have been adopted by other schools. In one case the answer to-the question 
as to the text-books used is, ‘‘Optional with the lecturers,” and in another case, 
“Medical and surgical reference books are obtained in library.” 
As a large city is the condition under which a hospital can flourish, so may it be 
said that the nurses’ training school is conditioned in a great measure on the hospital 
for its field of instruction. In fact these schools are almost always intimately con- 
nected with a hospital. From this it naturally follows that the financial statistics 
of the nurse-training school can not be given separately from those of the hospital.

  CHAPTER XXXII. 
EDUCATION OF SPECIAL CLASSES, 
I.—EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND BLIND. 
GENERAL REMARKS ON THE EDUCATION OF THE BLIND, 
The most interesting question before the educators and friends of the blind is, how 
to educate them to make them self-supporting. The want of confidence in them on 
the part of persons who can see is the great obstacle with which a blind person has 
tocontend, The question is almost universally asked, What can they do? We have 
numerons instances all around us of blind “clergymen, lawyers, musicians, business 
men, farmers, mechanics, dressmakers, typewriters, and, in fact, iu almost every 
occupation of life we find the blind at ‘work: with a success that contradicts the oft- 
repeated and mistaken idea that a blind person can not be successful in this great 
struggle. Courage, patience, and energy will bring the same reward to the blind as 
they will tothe seeing. The mountain side may be steeper, the path may be rougher, 
but concentration and courage will crown the efforts of the blind with success. 
The institutions of to-day for the blind are not only educating men and women 
in the theories of life work, but are imparting to them a practical knowledge of such 
subjects as each student seems to have an aptitude for. The broadened culture of 
the times, and the increasing competitions in trade, demand with emphasis the most 
skilled products of brain and hand. It is a serious thought that men in this age are 
liable to get out of place, and thus it behooves all to intensify and concentrate their 
life work on some specific occupation. 
The teacher of the blind should study until he understands thoroughly each pupil 
placed under his charge so that he can educate and foster any talent that he may 
possess. If musical ability exists, let him cultivate this talent until the student be- 
comes an expert—a specialist. If he finds that the student has a talent for teaching, 
let him give him all the advantages that the institutions of to-day possess, and make 
him an expert teacher. Whatever occupation the blind boy or girl makes choice of 
for his life work, let him or her be educated in that until success has been attained. 
A thorough mastery of some accomplishment, profession, or calling is the condition 
of success in after life for the blind, as well as for the seeing. 
The committee ppointad at the ninth biennial meeting of the instructors of the 
tind have abandoned the plan of a’national university, and are asking of Congress 
an appropriation, to be apportioned among the States, to help blind pupils who wish 
higher education to attend the seving universities and colleges. A bill to this effect 
has been placed by the committee in the hands of the House Committee on Educa- 
tion. 
MEETING OF THE AMERICAN INSTRUCTORS OF THE BLIND. 
The tenth biennial meeting of the American Instructors of the Blind was held at 
the Maryland School for the Blind, July 10, 11, and 12, 1888, 
The schools of the United States and Canada were largely represented. 
Papers were read upon the following subjects: ‘‘Home teaching,” ‘ Higher edu- 
cation,” ‘‘ Facial perception,” “ Stability .of office tenure,” ‘Institution discipline,” 
“Occupation available to the blind after finishing their school course,” ‘‘The culti- 
vation of memory,” ‘‘ Hints on teaching music,” ‘‘ Methods of teaching.” 
The advancement and elevation of this phase of educational work is greatly 
assisted by the holding of these conventions, The papers read and the methods dis- 
cussed serve to stimulate every teacher in the good work, 
The subjects discussed were all of the greatest importance to those interested in 
the education of the blind. 
1382
-P-A-G-E-721
  EDUCATION OF SPECIAL CLASSES. 1383" 
The paper on ‘The higher education and the future welfare of the indigent 
blind” was read by Mr. Doyle, of the Virginia Institution for the Deaf and the Blind. 
In it he says: 
“First. Higher education for the blind is most desirable. * * * It isa fact 
proven abundantly by themselves that the blind have both the capacity and the 
desire fur a higher education. * * * 
“Third. Ali that is lacking to provide for them in this respect is a wise utilization 
of the means already in hand, and the securing of a certain and adequate money sup- 
ply to enable the éléves of the institutions to enter the higher walks of learning 
after they have received the benefit of all the facilities that the institutions can 
furnish. 
“Fourth. This ‘certain and adequate money supply’ can come from but two 
sources, private benefactions or public appropriations. The first van scarcely be 
hoped for, certainly it can not be depended upon. The second can be secured if only 
this association will set itself heartily, vigorously at work to secure it.” 
Mr. Doyle would care for the indigent blind by helping them to care for them- 
selves. He says: ‘‘Surely if we want to raise the condition of the indigent blind man 
we should strive to do so, if it be possible, in such a way as to preserve his own self- 
respect. He should be encouraged to help himself to the extent of his abilities, and 
when his endeavor fails the helping hand should be extended. In working for him- 
self he will grow stronger as he surmounts difficulties. Every time a want is sup- 
plied by a man’s own efforts the faculty which is called into play becomes stronger 
and the receiving want is smaller in proportion to the power of meeting it. Every 
time a want is met by the exertions of some one else, the power of meeting it by one’s 
own effort is weakened.” 
He recommends that working homes for the blind be established in the different 
States similar to the working home for blind men in Philadelphia. 
Mr. Parmales, of the Nebraska Institute for the Blind, read a paper upon ‘‘The 
relation of schsol worls to the future of the blind.” In it he says: ‘More stress, 
it seems to me, needs continually to be laid upon the development of independent 
thought and research, the power to reason from cause to effect, of concentration upon 
a given subject, and such qualities of mind as courage, zeal, and persistence; a 
courage which is not daunted by defeat, a zeal not dependent on moods and eaprice, 
and resoluteness of purpose and oneness of aim which shall not be turned aside by 
every east wind of opposition or adversity. And, further to the same end, we should 
persistently endeavor to assist our charges to rid themselves of all mannerisms, to 
form correct habits, and withal to be able to meet their fellow-man with clean hands 
and a pure heart. These are the qualifications and this the work necessary in build- 
ing up a characte and personality which shall make itself felt in the home circle, 
in social or church life, or in the body politic.” 
S SOME CONCLUSIONS OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE DEAF, BLIND, ETC. 
The most important event of the year in the education of those who have lost or 
who have never pssessed sight or hearing is the long-awaited report of the Royal 
(English) Commisson on the Blind and the Deaf and Dumb. It was before this 
comm n that Professor Gallaudet, of the National Deaf College, testified as 
noted in our reportfor 1885-26, and subsequent y Prof. A. Graham Bell. 
The commission vas originally intended to investigate the condition of the blind, 
put subsequently the scope of the inquiry was enlarged to include the deaf and 
such feeble-minded persons as were educable. We are not, of course, concerned so 
much with the condition of the blind and deaf in England as with the conclusions 
that the commission has reached on the burning questions whether the pure oral 
method be the grestest good to the greatest number of deaf children, and what 
shall be done to help the blind graduate. On the question whether the New York 
Point is better thanthe Braille, a burning question in this country, there is no doubt 
in England; they hive one system only—the Braille. It should be stated, however, 
in passing that clases for the blind have been established by the school boards of 
London, Bradford, Cardiff, Sunderland, and Glasgow. <A public day school for the 
plind has not yet ben made a part of any of our city systems of public schools, as 
far as this Bureau isaware. For the deaf, of course, day schools have been estab- 
lished for some years 
The commissior fint defines the three systems of communication used by the deaf 
in the following terns: 
“The three systens—sign and manual, oral, and combined—while having in com- 
mon the desire to enzble the deaf to earn their livelihood, work to this end in different 
ways. The first speially trains the deaf to communicate and associate with their 
fellow-deaf; the pu oral system specially trains the deaf to communicate and asso- 
ciate with the hearng and speaking world; the combined system, as its name 
implies, tries to comtine the two former, the result being that, with few exceptions, 
   
-P-A-G-E-722
  i 
1384 ' EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
signs and the manual alphabet prevail and cause the pupil to relinquish the use of ¥ speech and to seek the society of deaf and dumb people. 
“Starting upon the assumption that a written language is common to all,.one 
party says: ‘We think that the sign language is the natural way in which the deaf 
and dumb express themselves ;’ the second, ‘ We aim at making the deaf and dumb 
conversant with our own language and able to express themselves in spoken lan- 
guage;’ the third, ‘Why shoald not you give the deaf and dumb the advantage of 
both systems?’ All these have a common objectin view; i. ¢., to acquire language, 
the first by manual alphabet in addition to signs, the second by speech alone, and 
the third by a combination of all three.” 
The commission think that all the deaf not physically or mentally unsuited for it 
should be taught to speak and lip-read on the pure oral system, and that all children 
who are deaf be taught for one year at least on the oral system. But if the oral 
system is to be carried out, teachers must be provided; for the oral teacher must 
have a thorough knowledge of the modus operandi of the vocal organs, the function 
of the tongue, lips, and nose in speech. To obtain this special training requires two 
years, as in Germany when these two years are additional to the usual teachers’ 
training course. 
The commission, however, is very far from advocating the radical changes that 
the resolutions of the Milan convention! caused in France. 
The number taught on each system of communication in the United Kingdom is as 
follows: 
Number taught on the manual and sign system 
Number taught on the combined system...... Number taught on the oral and pure oral system * 
   
   3,134 
At a recent conference of those interested in the education of the deaf and dumb the 
following resolutions were passed : 
“ Resolution No. 1.—That the provision of the education acts be extended to the 
deaf and dumb, and power be obtained to enforce the compulsory attendance of 
children at an institution or day school up to the age of sixteen. 
“ Resolution No. 2.—That recommendations of the royal commission Nos. 2 and 3 
be approved: No. 2, That when the number under any school authority is too small 
to form a class, or when the child is unable to attend an elementary scaool, the school 
authority should haye the power and be required either to send a child to an institu- 
tion or to board out such a child under proper inspection, and to contribute to his 
education and maintenance such annual grants as would be required to the contribu- 
tion now allowed to be paid by boards of guardians; and if there should be neither 
institution nor school available or willing to receive such child, the school authority 
should have the power, either by itself or in combination with other school authori- 
ties, to establish a school or institution for the purpose, and to educate such children 
under proper inspection. No. 3. That, independently of the position of the parent, a 
capitation grant, not less than half the cost of the education of such child, with a 
maximum grant of £10, should be given for all in the same way as in ordinary ele- 
mentary schools, and that the fees payable by necessitous parents should not exceed 
those payable in the case of ordinary children, but that in all cases parents should 
contribute according to their ability. 
“Resolution No. 3.—That recommendation of the royal comm*sion No. 4 be ap- 
proved; that the age of entry should, as far as possible, be seven; that pupils should, 
asa rule, be admitted only once a year; that the school attendaace should be com- 
pulsorily enforced for at least eight years without any existing linit of distance from 
school, and that power should be given to local authority to pay the rail or tram of 
such children when necesgary. 
“ Resolution No. 4.—That recommendation of the royal commission No. 7 be ap- 
proved; that technical instruction in industrial handicraft shouldbe under the educa- 
tion department as part of the curriculum in schools for the deafand dumb after the 
age of twelve or thirteen, and that this training be continued tosixteen. After six- 
teen it may be left to institutions to apprentice their pupils or jo send them to the 
technical or industrial schools provided for ordinary children. 
“ Resolution No. 5.—That this conference regards the establistment of a training 
college for teachers of the deaf and dumb as of paramount importance, and approves 
the paragraphs Nos. 19 and 20 of the recommendations of the :oyal commission in 
that behalf.” 
In the Bureau’s Report for 1886-87, when speaking of ‘‘ Workshops for the blind” 
(p. 838), mention is made of the ‘Saxon system” of care for the /lind—Fiirsorge, that 
is to say, protection.®   
1See p. 821, U. S. Bureau of Education Report, 1886-87. 
?The fund the interest of which is distributed, which was given in 1886-87as $7,500, was incorrect 
for that date. The fund is now about $250,000. 
 
-P-A-G-E-723
  EDUCATION, OF SPECIAL CLASSES. 1385 
The commission finds this to be the system best adapted to the purpose and recom- 
amends its adoption for the United Kingdom, under the following conditions: ‘ (1) 
That a register should be kept of all the pupils leaving the institution; (2) that they 
should be assisted in carrying on a trade, should they wish to set up for themselves, 
and in the first instance be provided with tools and material gratis, and subsequently 
at cost price; (3) that the institutions should endeavor to provide funds to supple- 
ment the workman’s earnings, grant loans, or afford him assistance in case of illness; 
(4) an endeavor should be made to interest some influential local agency, with which 
the institution should correspond on behalf of the blind.” 
Of course the first request is to obtain a sufficiently large fund, the interest of 
which would eke out the earnings of the blind workman. 
At the conference already referred to, the following resolutions in regard to the 
blind were also presented. It is thought probable that early legislation will carry 
the resolutions, both for the deaf and blind, into effect. 
' (1) That the time has now arrived when the education of the blind should be put 
on at least an equal footing with that of the seeing, and that provisions of the educa- 
tion acts and codes be therefore extended to them, with such modifications and fur- 
ther assistance as the conditions require, in accordance with the recommendations of 
the royal commission on this point, and that consequently those schools and insti- 
tutions which are willing to accept state inspection should be granted state aid. 
(2) That in the case of the blind, whether children or adults, it is also desirable 
that special technical and industrial training should be added, aided by the educa- 
tion department, in addition to other subjects. 
“«(3) In reference to the respectable oid and infirm blind the conference thoroughly 
indorses the recommendation of the royal commission, and also adopts the’ sugges- 
tion contained in paragraph 263 of their report, viz: ‘We think that when the 
industrious and well-conducted blind are unable to work and have to fall back on 
the assistance of the poor law, the workhouse test should not be applied, and we 
recommend that there should be a liberal outdoor relief (which should not subject 
them to any legal disqualifications) given to those who have friends to live with, and 
that the blind be not forced to go into the workhouse; and in the case of those who 
are admitted to the house, the workhouse selected for the purpose should be in a town 
where an institution or association for the blind already exists; the blind inmates, 
moreover, to be treated in a more generous way than ordinary paupers; and power 
should be given to the guardians in London or elsewhere to set apart a separate ward 
or home for the reception of the aged pauper blind, or to combine with other boards 
in providing a separate home for them. In case of women it might be expedient to 
place them in a cottage home.’” 
     
                                                   
        
   
      
      
    
     
        
    NOTES FROM CATALOGUES, ETC. 
I.—Institutions for the deaf. 
Alabama Institution for the Deaf, Talladega, Ala.—The commissioners and principal 
of this institution are earnestly recommending the establishment of a school for the 
colored deaf and blind. 
The oral department has been carried on with good results. The institution has 
secured an additional teacher and intends to enlarge in this direction. 
Arkansas Deaf-Mute Institution, Little Rock, Ark.—The north wing of this insti- 
tution has been entirely rebuilt. 
“Articulation and lip-reading and the related branches of auricular instruction 
have been given the same amount of attention as formerly. All those cases where it 
is thought there was a chance for sufficient permanent improvement to justify the 
attempt have been taught, and many cases where the chance seemed doubtful have 
been given a fair trial.” 
The great advantages of manual training seem to be thoroughly understood and 
appreciated in this institution. The department teaches drawing and painting, 
printing, photography, house-painting, shoemaking, sewing and domestic work. 
ey do job printing, and all the shoes that are used in the school are made by the 
upils. 
g California Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Berkeley, 
Cal.—There are 30 pupils in the articulation and lip-reading class of this institution. 
‘Ten minutes a day is the time given to each pupil in the class. The friends of the 
institution are asking for funds to enable them to employ more teachers. 
“The deaf are facile in everything requiring a quick eye and dexterous fingers. 
rawing, painting, modeling, carving, engraving, are among the branches of fine art 
‘in which the deaf mute may and often does excel. Of the mechanical arts none are 
eyond his reach, and it is only a question of advantage as to which he shall turn his 
and to. Up to this time there has not been much choice of handicraft offered in 
this institution. Wood-working and painting shops have been established, and the 
esults have justified the selection. The boys in both departments have made marked 
rogress, and the cabinet work done at their hands would not discredit journeymen.”

  1386 | EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
       Colorado Institute for the Mute and the Blind, Colorado Springs, Colo.—Every pupil 
on entering the school is placed in the articulation and lip-reading class. Those 
whose progress warrants success are keptinthe class. All the pupils are given instrue- 
tion in manual training of some sort. In the carpenter shop there are a number of 
boys that when it becomes necessary for them to leave the institution can make a 
ood comfortable living. The printing office publishes the Colorado Index, which 
Ra not only paid all the expenses of publication, but has been a source of revenue 
to the institution. 
American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, Hartford, Conn.—“ Of the pupils received 
into this school during the last 4 years 74 per cent. gave sufficient promise of success 
in acquiring speech and lip-reading to warrant their continued daily instruction in 
those branches. Of those taught, 47 per cent. were born deaf, 14 per cent. lost hear- 
ing under 2 years of age, 24+ per cent. lost hearing between the ages of 2 and 4 years, 
and 14+ per cent. lost hearing at the age of 4 years.” 
Of the manual training department the principal says: ‘Instruction in this new 
department was begun in 1822, and in the following year two large and convenient 
workshops were erected. From that day to this manual training has been a part 
of the instruction of every able-bodied boy, rich and poor alike, passing through 
his school course here. Our former pupils are now at work as cabinetmakers, car- 
penters, furniture-makers, in many other capacities where wood-working tools are 
used, and ina variéty of occupations which the training of eye and hand and of the 
judgment here has fitted them to take up successfully.” 
Kansas Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Olathe, Kans.—The oppor- 
tunity is given to those who show aptitude for the learning of articulation and lip- 
reading, with daily recitations in the class room, in addition to the regular work. 
In the industrial department the pupils are taught cabinetmaking, shoemaking, 
printing, andsewing. 
Maryland School for the Deaf and Dumb, Frederick, Md.— We give every child who 
enters an opportunity to learn to speak. No matter what the mental condition nor 
how unpromising the case may be, the child is faithfully taught through the first 
year by teachers who rank with the best in the country in oral teaching, At the end 
of the year those who have not made sufficient progress to justify their continuance 
are dropped from the oral classes and from time to time receive their instruction 
through the manual and sign method.” 
The principal, in speaking of the industrial department, in his annual report says: 
“All boys who are large enough are employed about hours daily, either in the 
shoe shops, cabinet shop, or printing office. They are assigned to one or the other, 
either by choice of parent of the boy himself, or the principal, and are seldom 
allowed to change from one to the other. Our boots and shoes are disposed of at 
wholesale at fair prices and are in constant demand. ‘The shop, however, is not a 
source of revenue nor can any shop be which is carried on by the labor of pupils 
whose time is chiefly devoted to school. Our shops are schoolrooms and our fore- 
men teachers whose business is to train workmen rather than to turn off work. The 
cabinet shop does all our repair work except plumbing, makes up such articles of 
furniture as we require, and sometimes fills orders for tine work for outside parties. 
We have also made a good deal of cheap work for the furniture stores, 
“In the printing office we have continued the publication of the Bulletin, a 
biweekly newspaper for general circulation as well as for use in the school, have 
printed our own reports and daily lessons for the ciass use and other miscellaneous 
work, 
The girls have been taught plain sewing and the use of machines. The older ones 
have also been instructed in dressmaking. 
Clarke Institution for Deaf-Mutes, Northampton, Mass.—‘ In our schoolroom work our 
first aim is to develop the minds of our pupils and to teach language as an expression 
of thought. During the-earlier years all effort is directed toward this end. The 
later years are occupied with a regular course of study, although the acquisition of 
language is always considered of prime importance. The ease with which such 
branches of study may be pursued is in exact proportion to the knowledge of lan- 
guage previously acquired. This knowledge of language we attempt to give through 
the oral method, so called. This method teaches the child spoken words first, then 
written words. Our communication with pupils and all instruction is through spoken’ 
or written language. Ability to understand the language of books and the spoken 
language of the persons with whom one is associated is all that is needed to make 
urlimited acquisition of knowledge possible. In so far as we can impart this ability 
to our pupils we furnish them in the best possible way for life among men. ‘If wel 
add to this such training of eye and hand as shall fit our boys and girls to suppor 
themselves, we have surely done for them the utmost in our power. With this las' 
object in view, our older boys are employed in cabinetwork under a competent in. 
structor from 2 to 3 hours each day. The girls are taught sewing and light house. 
work, and instruction in wood carving and cast drawing is given to all the olde

upils who, on trial, show any aptness foreither. Physical culture is not neglected. 
Bienty of exercise in the open air is insisted upon, and gymnastic exercises are prac- 
ticed regularly in the primary school; but the need, especially for our older pupils, 
of a well-equipped gymnasiun is greatly felt. 
Michigan School for the Deaf, Flint, Mich.—The chief aim of this school is to give 
the pupils a knowledge of the English language. To have pupils to elegantly ex- 
press themselves and think in this language is the great end sought. 
No one method is used to the exclusion of others. In the oral classes pupils are 
confined to lip-reading and speech. The manual alphabet is generally used in all 
other class rooms as a means of communication. 
None but expert instructors in the workshops of this institution are employed. 
The trades taught are those that the pupils will be most likely to find employment 
in when they leaye the school. - 
After a five-years’ course of study the pupils are given an industrial training-course, 
each pupil spending four hours daily at his work. Cabinetmaking, shoemaking, 
punting, plumbing, baking, and farm work are taught to the boys. The girls are 
taught sewing, dressmaking, ironing, making beds, sweeping, doing dining-room 
and kitchen work. 
Minnesota Institute for Defectives, Faribault, Minn.--On entering this school all the 
pupils are placed in the articulation class and given a fair trial, and if the teacher 
is satisfied that the pupil can not successfully be taught lip-reading and speech, 
articulation is discontinued. Fifteen pupils are taught exclusively speech and lip- 
reading and have no other method of communication with each other and their 
teachers. More than 10 percent. of the pupils of this institution have been found 
capable of receiving permanent improvement in articulation and lip-reading. 
The progress in the industrial department is very gratifying to the superintendent. 
He says: ‘‘ The shop makeseducation practical, not to say profitable. It makes 
children grow up familiar with work, and when they leave school they do not feel 
above work.” * * * 
“Manual work and intellectual work ought not to be divorced, and when a boy 
is taught to use his hands as well as his brains, his education is broader, more 
practical, and more helpful to himself and the State.” 
St. Joseph's Institute for the Improved Instruction of Deaf-Mutes, Fordham, N. Y.—A 
new and commodious building has been erected for this school; the entire cost will 
not exceed $55,000. Strict attention is paid to speech and lip-reading in the more 
advanced classes. All the lessons are studied until the language is thoroughly 
understood. The industrial department also receives its full share of attention. 
Many of the older pupils’ that have left the institution have been successful in 
obtaining employment. 
Western Pennsylrania Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, Edgewood, 
Pa.—The combined method of instruction is used in this institution. More attention 
is being given to articulation and lip-reading. 
A new building has been erected for the industrial department, which has infused 
new life in this part of the work, The older pupils spend from three to four hours 
a day in the workshops, the younger ones about two hours, Shoemaking, carpentry, 
cabinetmaking, and wood carving is taught. All the furniture required for the , 
building is made in the cabinet shop by the boys of the institution. The girls are 
taught plain sewing, dressmaking, and honse work. 
Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Philadelphia, Pa.—The board of 
directors of this institution has purchased a new site in the Twenty-second ward of 
the city of Philadelphia, containing 61 acres, at a cost of $120,000. They hope to 
complete the new building in about three years. More than $500,000 will be required 
for all the improvements, 
In the oral department of this school there are eleven instructors and one hundred 
pupils. In the industrial department instruction is given in printing, drawing, 
tailoring, shoemaking, carpentering, glazing, dressmaking, and cooking. 
Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Staunton, Va.—In 
this institution the industrial department receives especial attention, It includes 
carpentering, upholstering, joiner work, house-painting and baking, all under the 
supervision of competent instructors. 
The combined method of instruction is used. 
Wisconsin School for the Deaf, Delavan, Wis.—The oral and combined methods are 
taught in this school. Special oral instruction is given to three classes, and good 
results have been obtained. For twenty years past speech and lip-reading has been 
taught in this institution. 
Two and one-half hours daily are spent in the workshops. The pupils are taught 
shoemaking, carpentering, printing, baking, sewing, and mending.

    1388 ‘EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
IL.—ZJnstitutions for the blind. 
Indiana Institution for the Education of the Blind, Indianapolis, Ind.—The normal 
department of niusic is comparatively new in this institution. The aim of this de- 
partment is to give such instruction in the art and practice of teaching as to make 
of each pupil a successful teacher. 
Great interest is feltin the industrial department of this school. Thesuperintendent 
says in his annual report to the trustees: ‘‘ While we do not undervalue in the least 
degree the many benefits to be derived from intellectual and musival culture, yet we 
feel that in a school for the blind too much attention can not be given to industrial 
education, for we recognize the fact that the mental stamina and natural inclination 
of many blind youths are such that if they are fitted at all by training io earn their 
own living it must be done by teaching them some useful trade. Furthermore, to be 
occupied in some congenial handicraft and be able to manipulate the different parts 
of simple machinery and different kinds of material are not only sources of. great 
pleasure to the blind, but they furnish means by which habits of industry, persever- 
ance, and activity are cultivated. * * * Therefore no scheme for the education 
and training of the blind that does not provide for a well-equipped and well-regu- 
lated industrial department is complete.” 
Kansas Institution for the Education of the Blind, Kansas City, Kans.—The superin- 
tendent in his report to the trustees speaks of the prosperous condition of this insti- 
tution and the practical results of the graded system of the school. He says: ‘Its 
results have been most beneficial to the pupil as well as the teacher, making the 
work of both much more easy and thorough, and enabling us to give to the primary 
department that vigorous training which is so much needed in after life.” 
Speaking of the results of the point method, he says: ‘‘ With a thorough knowledge 
of the point, equipped with all the requirements, a blind pupil will accomplish as 
much and with nearly the same rapidity as the seeing.” 
Maryland School for the Blind, Baltimore, Md.—The committee on instruction of 
ue ponent strongly recommends the higher education of the pupils of the school for 
the blind. 
*(2) Blindness is a physical defect, and always must limit the physical efficiency 
of the blind man, but his intellectual capability is another thing. The public is too 
apt to confound the two, while in practice the very fact of the physical defect actu- 
ally increases the mental power, for it calls into play such faculties as concentration 
and attention to a higher degree than the seeing can ever need them. 
“*(3) If the above is true there is no class of our fellow-men who require more the 
benefit of a higher education. At present the public idea is that a blind man can 
be educated to a certain point, and at this point his physical defect places the limit. 
The public utterance in all the schools, ‘thus far shalt thou go, and no farther,’ is 
unfortunately taken up by the blind, for a man is very apt to believe himself to be 
what his fellow-man declares him, and the blind man with his sense of infirmity is 
probably more sensitive to such impressions than the seeing. It is not necessary to 
call to mind a historian like Prescott, a postmaster-general like Fawcett, or a mathe- 
matician like Carl; there are numerous instances all around us, lawyers, musicians, 
clergymen, business men, who have simply become so because they had the means 
to secure a higher education. 
“(4) We are often told that such and such a blind man has failed in the struggle of 
life, and this is used as an argument to prove that the blind man can not successfully 
hold his own in this great struggle. I have made it my business to inquire of a large 
number of superintendents and individuals, and I have yet to meet the first case 
where the blind man has failed because he was blind. In every instance he would 
have failed from the same want of character had he been a seeing man,and to step a 
little lower, I have yet to find in all my experience, with one exception, a single 
instance of a blind beggar who was not either an imposter, vicious, or profligate, 
and my experience is the same as that of others connected with the blind.” 
Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School for ihe Blind, Boston, Mass.—This insti- 
tution has received a bequest of $4,250 by the will of Ann Schofield; also a gift of 
$38,000 towards the endowment fund for the kindergarten department from Miss 
Helen C. Bradlee. The gift of Miss Bradlee is the largest thus far the institution has 
ever received. It will be known as the ‘ Bradlee Fund.” 
The building dedicated one year and a half ago to the uses of the kindergarten 
has already become crowded to its utmost capacity. The director of this depart- 
ment has asked the trustees for a second building similar to the first one in size and 
architecture. 
Ohio Institution for the Education of the Blind, Columbus, Ohio.—The superintendent 
recommends action on the part of the legislature making it compulsory to send chil- 
dren of proper ages and mental capacity to the school provided for then by the 
State. He also indorses the action of the couyention of the American Instructors for 
the Blind in Baltimore, Md., in reference to the printing of text-books on every sub- 
ject taught in the various ‘institutions; and believes that the use of text-books will
-P-A-G-E-727
  EDUCATION OF SPECIAL CLASSES. 1389 
teach them to rely more upon themselves and to utilize time lost by the oral method. 
He recommends the use of the New York Point in printing the majority of the books 
for the use of the blind, because it is more easily read by those whose fingers are less 
delicate to touch, and because the point is available for writing, ‘‘ enabling pupils 
to take notes on their school work to preserve for future reference, and for pur- 
poses of correspondence.” He says that higher education is desirable, and with the 
proper facilities provided the usefulness and happiness of the pupils will be secured, 
and the graduates will profit by the higher course. He recommends thé addition of 
a collegiate department, equipped with the necessary teaching force and apparatus 
for acquiring the higher education. 
This institution has a well-equipped manual-training department. In the tuning 
shop thirty-four young men are taught tuning and repairing. Eight pianos and five 
models of actions from different manufactories areused. Fifty-four pupils are learn- 
ing to make brooms, who devote their time to this work when not occupied with 
other duties. In the cane-seating shop there are forty-six pupils under instruction. 
In the sewing department ninety-six girls are taught plain hand and machine sewing, 
darning and mending. 
Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, Philadelphia, Pa.—In this 
institution the higher education of the pupils is recommended, aud in the manual 
training department the selection of special trades for the blind is considered of the 
greatest importance. Trades that can be followed by individuals should be selected, 
and care should be taken to select such trades as are not likely to be interfered with 
by the introduction of machinery. The superintendent also recommends instruction 
in business methods, and that the pupils be taught to cultivate habits of self-reliance. 
This school claims to be the first to have formally introduced cooking as a regular 
branch of instruction. 
“4 room has been fitted as a kitchen, and here twice a week sixteen girls may be 
seen busily at work over their tasks, involving all the principles of the culinary art. 
Not only are they tanght to bake and broil and fry, but the course goes deeper in the 
training in domestic economy, the arts of utilizing previously cooked foods, the 
making of palatable and nutritious dishes from inexpensive materials, undesirable 
cuts of meat, and the parts usually wasted; in fact, in the many petty household 
economies of which the French are masters and in which the American housewife is 
commonly deficient. The chemical composition of foods, as well as the requirements 
of the body, are all considered, and fact and rule take the place of judgment and taste, 
those terms so common in cook books. 
“The experience of a year has shown it to be entirely practical and fully justifies 
the anticipations of success.” 
Remarks on the tables. 
The Eastern Iowa School for the Deaf, at Dubuque, Iowa, and the Albany School, 
at Albany, N. Y., are private institutions for the education of the deaf and dumb and 
have been established since the preceding Report. The manual or sign method of 
instruction is used by the Eastern Iowa School, and the oral at the Albany School. 
Of the 75 institutions for the deaf appearing in the following tables, 66 have re- 
ported direct to this Office. Forty-two use the combined method of instruction, 15 
the pureoral, and 9 the manual or sign method. The numberof pupils taught speech 
and lip-reading in the schools using the combined and oral methods as reported to us 
is 2,274, or about 28 per cent. of the whole number of pupils reported in the institu- 
tions for the deaf and the dumb. Two hundred and eighty-nine pupils graduated 
from these institutions in 1888-89. The whole number of pupils graduated since the 
organization of the institutions is 5,075. ‘The number of pupils in the kindergartens 
is 161, and in the manual training departments 2,757. The trades taught are photo- 
graphy, gardening, drawing, painting, sewing, dressmaking, carpentry, printing, 
shoemaking, molding, patternmaking, coopering, wood engraving, wood carving, 
charcoal drawing, crayon drawing, typewriting, tailoring, cooking, machine sewing, 
millinery, stocking knitting, fancy work, scroll sawing, modeling in clay, metal 
working, laundry, housepainting, plumbing, bookbinding, glazing, and farming. 
The number of institutions that give instruction in kindergarten work is 6, and in 
manual training 38. The schools are raising the standards of their literary depart- 
ments and are reporting progress all along the line. 
The number of institutions for the blind appearing in the tables is 34, including 
the institution at Cheyenne, Wyo., from which no information has been received. 
by this office. The 33 institutions reporting show an increase of 71 instructors and 274 
pupils over last year’s report. 
In the cases of institutions for both the deaf and blind it has been found impossible 
to separate the receipts and expenditures of the departments for the deaf from those 
of the departments forthe blind. In order to prevent confusion and a fictitious in- 
crease in these items, all. the financial statistics received from such institutions have 
been placed in the tables of statistics of the education of the deaf. The school for 
the colored blind at Austin, Tex., is the only exception to this.

  EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
IL—EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
seed REMARKS. 
The first school for the care and hieainitiy of the feeble-minded was opened by Dr. 
H. B. Wilbur in the village of Barre, Mass., in 1848. Soon after the opening of this 
school Dr. 8. G. Howe, of the Perkins Institute for the Blind, opened a school at 
South Boston, Mass. New York was the next to establish a school, and Pennsylvania 
quickly followed. Since the establishment of the first institution 27 schools, public 
and private, have been opened, and nearly $1,000,000 were expended the past year 
for their support. 
In the plan of organization of the schools two departments are provided for—the 
educational and the custodial. The educational department embraces those receiv- 
ing instruction not only in ordinary branches of a common school but also indus- 
trial occupations and manual labor. The custodial department has the care of those 
inmates to whom schoolroom exercises are cousidered unprofitable. An effort is 
made in this department to teach the pupils personal cleanliness and usefulness in 
domestic matters, and to break them of bad habits previously formed. 
The question that arises in considering the usefulness of these schools is, can the 
feeble-minded be educated and trained so as to be self-supporting? Itisnot claimed 
by the friends of this class of defectives that the greater number of them can be 
made self-sustaining, but it is well established that many that have been sent from 
the institutions are leading useful lives and are not burdens to the community or to 
     their friends. 
Wherever adequate training has b: 
feeble-minded children have been f 
ment. It is therefore urged by all v 
nor county infirmaries, nor hospital: 
fortunates, but that institutions and 
whose necessities demand such provi

Fifteenth National Conference of Charities and

provided for in a single large building of three or four stories in height than in 
smaller and lower buildings. The fallacy of this theory has lately been demon- 
strated in a number of places, the most notable and successful instance within our 
knowledge being at the Willard Asylum for the Insane in New York. * * * 
“By a slow process of evolution and elimination the plans were worked out to the 
best of our ability, and were submitted for the approval of the governor and council, 
in accordance with law. * * * They were approved, and we were permitted to 
expend $60,000 in construction. Building has gone on during the summer, and now, 
as it is approaching completion, we are happy to say that it will be completed to 
the last detail, including boiler house, laundry, steam heating, and grading, within 
the sum approved.” 
Minnesota School for Fecble-Minded, Faribault, Minn.—The superintendent says: 
“Tn the school department, which comprises the school proper and the manual train- 
ing feature, is centered the principai activity of the institution. The plan of training 
which we refer to as the codrdinate system has been maintained—that is, individual 
children under instruction are oceupied during short periods at a time only at one 
thing, and these periods alternate between the school and manual training rooms, 
in which the work is being conducted simultaneously. * * 
“Constructive occupations are preéminently adapted to child training, as proven 
by the experience of kindergarten and manual training schools everywhere.” 
The New Jersey State Institution for Feeble-Minded Women, Vineland, N, J.—This is 
a new institution and appears in our tables for the first time. 
“The managers consider themselves fortunate in having secured so desirable a 
property, and especially a building so well equipped for the, immediate reception of 
inmates, there being accommodation at the present time for 20 feeble-minded women.” 
The Garrison Home and Training School for the Feeble in Mind, Cranbury, N. J.—Dur- 
ing the past year this institution was established at Cranbury, N. J. Itis a private 
home for the feeble in mind and is conducted by the Rev. C. F. Garrison. 
Haddonfield Training School for Girls Mentally Deficient or Peculiarly Backward, Had- 
donfield, N. J.-—This is a private institution; the number of its pupils is limited to ten. 
The managers fee] assured of the success of the school. 
Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth, Beatrice, Nebr.—The superintendent 
in his report says: ‘‘The buildings, for which the last legislature made appropriations, 
have been completed. * * * The building will be a great improvement on the 
present one in ths way of convenient arrangement, as well as being much more pleas- 
ant. Itis well ventilated, having separate vent flues and fresh-air flues for each room.” * * * 
“The experience of older institutions of this kind is, that large tracts of land 
are not only amatter of economy, the farm products largely supplying the institution, 
thus greatly lessening the cost of maintenance, but are also of great usefulness in the 
training and physical-development of the children, agricultural pursuits being par- 
ticularly adapted to persons of this class. Again, since the majority of the people of 
our State are engaged in farming, the pupils should be taught that which they will be 
able to follow under the direction of their parents when returned to their homes.” 
Ohio Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth, Columbus, Ohio.—The trustees of this in- 
stitution have asked the legislature for an appropriation of $100,000 for the purchase 
of suitable farming lands. ; 
Pennsylvania Training School for Feeble-Minded Children, Elwyn, Pa.—Samuel A. 
Crozier, president, says: ‘Our free fund continues to invite the beneficent thought 
of the charitable; we gratefully acknowledge donations and bequests to this worthy 
object, amounting during the year to $12,000, raising the invested fund at this day to $101,000.” 
Superintendent’s annual report; manual teachers; ‘With the beginning of the 
current year seven ladies were added to our corps of teachers, under the title ‘man- ual trainers,’ who, by their alternation with the school teachers, bring all the edu- 
cable children of the school department under intelligent care and direction for fifteen 
hours out of the twenty-four. The whole staff is divided into two details, five and a 
quarter months each, the manual teachers of the first term being the school teachers of the second, and so alternately. I have long been of the opinion that neither the 
insane nor the feeble-minded should be under any less than the painstaking, contin- uous, and concientious care of educated people; that long hours with illiterate, irre- 
sponsible people of the servant class is not promotive of cure or improvement. I am sure that one loud-spoken, uncouth, dictatorial attendant will do more harm to the 
nature of a child in the few hours that he or she may have it in care than can be 
eradicated by the best normal training, under tRe direct care of matron and teacher, during the other hours of the day.”    
 
-P-A-G-E-742
  1404 eh EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
Remarks upon the tables, | | 
In presenting the statistics of the institutions for the care and training of the feeble- 
minded it appears that there has been a large increase in the number of schools, of 
pupils, and of teachers. Returns have been received from 26 institutions, an increase 
of 4 over last year. Four thousand seven hundred and eighty-four pupils are in the 
institutions at present, an increase of 463 over last year’s report. The increase of 
instructors has kept pace with the increase of pupils. The number of instructors 
reported this year is 141, an increase of 19 over last year. The amount appropriated 
by the States for the public institutions is $936,425, an increase of $10,168. 
Of the 26 institutions that have reported to this Bureau 15 are supported by States, 
1 by a county, and 10 are private homes, which do not furnish any financial statis- 
tics to this Office. Eighteen have manual training and 16 have kindergartens. 
From four to five hours each day are spent in the schoolrooms. After the school 
hours the younger children are allowed to play and romp either in the play rooms 
or out of doors if the weather permits. The older ones, under competent instructors, 
are all given some useful employment, the males in the work shops or on the farm, 
the females at sewing or hougehold duties.

  1408 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-39. 
IIl.—REFORM SCHOOLS. 
    The cottage system.—The term “ family system” seems to be used as though it were 
a synonym for the expression, ‘‘ cottage system.” Thus, in answer to the inquiry, ‘Is 
your institution operated on the cottage system?” one school answers, ‘We have 
one family ;” another, “The change to the family plan is now being made;” still a 
third, “No; but we have the family spirit.” It is possible to consider the inmates 
of a large building having the usual assortment of stories and wings, as an overgrown 
family, and the building as an overgrown cottage; and itis also possible to conceive 
the inhabitants of such a building broken up into groups, just as a regiment is com- 
posed of companies. In both these instances the manner in which the family or fami- 
lies are organized is the main feature; but in the cottage system the distinguishing 
feature is in the isolation of the family by giving each a separate habitation. It 
would seem that the term ‘‘ cottage system” may mean the organization of the family 
system, and something more. | 
Among the institutions reporting for the year under review, there are forty which 
give information in answer to the inquiry as to whether they had adopted the cottage 
system. Fifteen answer “ yes,” and eighteen “no.” Three others give the responses 
noted in the preceding paragraph, and the others are introducing the cottage system. 
Movement of the population—Thirty-six schools, not including the Elmira State 
Reformatory for Men, report their population during the year, and also the number 
leaving during the same period. In these 36 schools there were 17,661 pupils en- 
rolled, of whom 7,181, or 41 per cent. were disposed of or left the institutions under 
the following circumstances:

   (in many ¢: 
        7,181 40.5 
    
Receipts from public funds, etc.—As far as reported the amount received from public 
funds is nearly $2,000,000,though the reports are somewhat imperfect. This goes to 
show that from 85 to 90 per cent. of the means of support of reformatory institutions 
is received from the public treasury.! Of the amount received, $357,708 were ex- 
pended in building and improvements, and $527,622 for salaries, 17 per cent. and 24 
per cent., respectively, of the whole expenditure.

Remarks upon the tables. 
Number of colored children in the schools.—It will be seen that, taking all the above 
States together, the colored children form 32.7 per cent., or a trifle less than 
one-third of the total school population 6 to 14 years of age, while the colored 
pupils form only 27.6 per cent., or little more than one-fourth of the total enroll- 
ment; i.¢., the colored population supplies considerably less than its due proportion 
of pupils to the public schools. This is the case in each of the States individually, 
with the exception of North Carolina and Texas, where the proportion of children 
and of school enrollment is about the same, and the District of Columbia, where the 
proportion of colored children is 35.3 per cent. and of colored pupils 36.3 per cent. 
Looking at the actual number-of pupils enrolled for each 100 children of 6 to 
14 years of age (columns 6 and 7, Table 2) it is found to be seventy-two for 
the colored population and ninety-one for the white, a decided difference; and if the 
number of white children receiving an education outside of the public schools could 
be taken into consideration a still greater discrepancy would appear. 
Regularity of attendance.—Not only are there fewer colored pupils than white en- 
rolled in proportion to the number of children, but thé regularity of attendance of 
colored pupils is less than the white. The summaries of columns 10 and 11, Table 
2, show that out of every one hundred colored pupils enrolled 62.3 on an average 
attend each day; and out of alike number of white pupils 65 attend each day on 
an average. This is not a very great difference, however, and under all the circum- 
stances may be considered a satistactory relative showing. In Alabama, Kentucky, 
EOpIsiane, and South Carolina the regularity of the colored pupils exceeds that of 
the white. 
Length of school term.—The colored schools are kept an average of 89.2 days in the 
nine States which furnish the necessary data for determining this item, and the white 
schools an average of 93.6 days (columns 2 and 3, Table 3). Delaware furnishes a 
large part of this difference, due to the colored people being left mainly to their own 
resour¢es in that State. In Maryland, also, there is a considerable difference in the 
length of the school terms. Outside of these two States the difference is trifling. 
Teachers’ wages.—The average of the monthly wages of colored teachers in six 
States reporting this item is $27.35; of white teachers, $32.74 (columns 5 and 6, 
Table 3). This difference may be considered to proceed in part from the circum- 
stance that among the white teachers there are a greater proportional number in 
the higher and better-paid grades than among the colored, thus raising their average.

ION REPORT, 1888-89. 
In Kentucky the average wages of the colored teachers exceed that of the white. 
This results from the colored districts being larger than the white districts, contain- 
ing more children, and therefore drawing more of the State money, which is applied 
exclusively to the payment of the district teacher. ; 
} 
THE SOURCES OF SUPPORT OF COLORED PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
In all the former slave States, except Delaware and Maryland, the annual State | 
school revenue is apportioned impartially among all the children of the State with- 
out regard to color, so much per capita to each child. In Maryland the State school 
tax is apportioned among the white schools only, but a special appropriation is made 
from the State Treasury for the colored schools, sufficient to make the colored per 
capita of State moneys practically equal to that ofthe white. For the year 1888-89 
the colored schools of Maryland received about $100,000 from this source. 
Now, as to local funds. Throughout the rural districts of the South the colored 
people are dependent chiefly upon this State apportionment, which is by law devoted 
mainly, if not exclusively, to the payment of teachers’ salaries. Any additional sum 
required for building, repairs, fuel, or incidental expenses, or for lengthening the 
short school term which the State apportionment can only afford, must be raised by , 
themselves. In the larger and more progressive cities, on the other hand, the city 
appropriation for schools is general, and is allotted to the various public schools, 
white and colored. according to the needs of each, in the judgment of the local school 
authorities. The State of Kentuck), however, has enacted that no white person 
shall be (locally) taxed for the support of a colored school, or vice versa. In that 
State the colored schools have their own trustees and district boundaries, forming - 
an absolutely distinct system. | 
Is is difficult, as a general thing, to determine the amounts expended for white 
and colored schools in cities, as these sums are not reported separately, The follow- 
ing instances, however, may be noted: 
ishmane Va., received from the State in 1887-88 the sum of $28,855, of which the 
colored share, according to school population, was about $12,000; yet the city paid 
to colored teachers, not including principals, that year $33,513, the excess (amount- 
ing to over $20,000), coming from the general city appropriation, and this in addition 
to whatever amount was expended for colored buildings, etc. 
Birmingham, Ala., received in 1888-89, from the State for its colored schools, and 
from colored poll taxes, $2,092. It paid for colored teachers’ salaries alone $6,250, the 
excess being furnished by the city; so for Selma and some other cities of Alabama, 
Wilmington, Del., in 1887-88 expended $18,745 upon colored schools, of which 
about $6,000 was for building. This amount apparently all came from the general 
* funds of the city; at most, only an insignificant sum was received from any other 
source. 
City Superintendent W, F. Slaton, of Atlanta, says (1889): 
“The Gray Street school for colored children, built and equipped during the past 
year, isin my opinion the best schoolhouse in Atlanta. It was built on the most 
modern plan; wisely arranged in regard to the admission of light; furnished with 
Smead’s system of heating and earn furnislied with Andrew’s best desks ; sup- 
plied with maps, charts, and other aids in teaching.” 
State Superintendent Pickett, of Kentucky, states in his report for 1888-89 that 
‘the receipts and expenditures of the white and colored schools are not kept sepa- 
rate in a number of the cities,” which would seem to indicate that the Kentucky law 
referred to above was not observed in those cities, but that the school funds were 
common to both races. 
Delaware makes a more meager provision for the education of colored children 
than any other State. There the funds raised by taxation under the State law are 
not apportioned impartially to the children of the State; but the taxes levied upon 
each race are applied to the support of schools for their own children exclusively, 
so that the tax upon the real and personal property and poll of colored persons is 
“set apart as a separate and distinct fund for the support and maintenance of col- 
ored schools, and the white tax is reserved for the white schools. 
Moreover, the proceeds of the State School Fund are appropriated to white 
schools exclusively. For the colored schools an appropriation is made direct from the 
State treasury. This appropriation for colored schools has been increased from $2,400 
in 1881 to about $5,000 in 1883. | 
Both the taxes levied upon colored persons and the State appropriation for colored 
schools are paid over to the Treasurer of the African School Society, which society, 
under the law, distributes it among the colored schools of the State; and by an 
arrangement with the county superintendents much of the work of supervising the 
colored. schools has been left in the hands of Mr. H. C. Conrad, treasurer and actuary 
of the African School Society.

EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. ~ 1415 
The amount of money actually raised for the schools of each race in 1886 (the latest 
year available), together with the number of white and colored children, is as follows :

The white schools thus received in appropriations and taxes more than five times 
as much per capita of the school population as the colored schools: 
The total receipts, moreover, wouldallow an average of $439 to each white school 
and $104 to each colored school. 
Regarding the status of the colored schools of Delaware, Superintendent L. I. Handy, 
of Kent County, says in his report: 
“According to an understanding among the county superintendents, we have left 
much of the work of supervising negro schools in the hands of Mr, H. C. Conrad, of 
Wilmington. I have, however, devoted some personal attention to those schools in 
Kent County, as well as exercised a general supervision over them. On my round of 
visits to the white schools I have occasionally called at negro schools, and have found 
them in as good condition as could be expected under the circumstances. All that I 
have visited were entirely primary in their work. For a detailed report of these 
schools I must refer you to Mr. Conrad; but I destre to express the opinion that the 
law in regard to negro schools, passed at the last session of the legislature, and the 
money now appropriated bythe State, are sufficient for present requirements. Isay 
this, feeling a deep interest in the education of negro children, and appreciating the 
importance to the whole commonwealth of elevating in every possible way the negro 
race, which has been thrust into our midst by the hand of a ruthless past. It would 
be most unfortunate for the negro schools if they should become a bone of contention 
between the pounce! parties. In advising that the present status be left unaltered 
at this time, I speak as a sincere friend of the negro schools, A system of good schools 
among the negroes can not be quickly created; it must grow. Although fully appre- 
ciating the services which Mr. Conrad has rendered the State by his labors in behalf 
of the negro schools, it is my intention, if the law remains unchanged and I continue 
in office another year, to relieve him of responsibility in regard to the negro schools 
of Kent County.” 
\ 
Where do the State funds come from? It has been stated above that in each of the 
Southern States, except Delaware and Maryland, the annual State fund is apportioned 
impartially among the white and colored children, It becomes desirable to know 
how much of these funds comes from colored sources, Unfortunately this is difficult 
to determine, The annual State fund in these States is derived in the main from the 
income of permanent funds, direct appropriations by the States, and taxes on property 
or polls, by far the major part of which, except poll taxes, would seem to come from 
the white population, 
As regards North Carolina, State Superintendent S. M. Finger, in addressing the 
school officers, says: ‘(But perhaps you say the negroes are in the way. * * * 
Do you know that, including poll tax which they actually pay, fines, forfeitures, and 
penalties, the negroes furnish a large proportion of the money that is applied to 
their public schools?” . 
In 1882, Gustavus J. Orr, then State Superintendent of Georgia, undertook an 
elaborate investigation, in order to determine the exact truth in this matter, and 
reached a conclusion regarding that State similar to that indicated by Superintend- 
ent Finger for North Carolina.. He found that out of $151,000 paid to colored teachers 
by the State, $145,000 might be considered as having been contributed, directly or 
indirectly, by the colored people. But he called attention to another feature of the 
question, which must be taken into consideration, viz, that the negroes furnished 
nothing else toward the payment of the public expenses ; or, as Superintendent Orr 
expressed it: “The white people, who really hold all the power of the State govern- 
ment in all its departments, allowed the negroes for the support of their schools more 
than the whole amount paid by them for all purposes, and then took upon them- 
selves all the other expenses of the Government.” Andagain: ‘It is true that colored 
\
-P-A-G-E-754
  \ 
  people contribute nearly all of what is paid [by the State] for the education of their 
children, as has been already shown; but they are made to do this, as has also been 
shown, by so selecting the sources of school revenue as to put all that they pay into 
the school fund.” It must be acknowledged that if a due proportion of the colored 
poll taxes, fines, ete., were applied to other (or general) objects, their school moneys 
would have to be sypplemented by just so much from funds proceeding from the 
white people; and the State of Georgia, in relieving the colored people of these 
eneral public charges, virtually applies to their education to this extent funds raised 
from the whites. | 
In Kentucky there were collected from the colored people for State taxes in 1884-85, 
$13,988 ; there were disbursed by the State for colored schools the same year $137,851 
leaving $123,863 as the ‘‘ amount paid by white taxpayers to equalize the per capita? 
It may be stated in this connection that the same year (1884-85), the colored 
people raised in the ‘‘counties” in Kentucky, by local taxation and subscriptions, 
$19,210, and in 1888-89, $29,044, which may be taken as a measure of their ability 
and inclination to raise local funds, and of the progress they have made in these 
particulars. | 
State Superintendent J. Desha Pickett says, of their effort to supplement the funds 
of the State: ‘‘ This is prime proof of intelligent interest and of genuine progress in 
their system of common schools. The colored people of the Commonwealth are wide 
awake under the beneficent provisions in the new order of things. * * * Other 
proofs are presented of progress in the colored schools, which must certainly be a 
subject of congratulation to every thoughtful citizen of the Commonwealth, in view 
of the facts that the colored man is here to stay, and that the State is heavily taxed 
for his improvement.” ‘That a race of people, descended a few generations back 
from serpent worshipers in the wilds of Africa, within less than a score of years after 
being freed, and out of a mass of illiterates hundreds of thousands strong, have a 
regularly organized system of education, conducted by more than a thousand ’ 
teachers, men and women of their own race, with thrice as many trustees, and only 
white boards and superintendencies, coanty and State, is another marvel in the 
history of ethics, ethnology, and the education of nations. It speaks well for that 
race; and it speaks eloquently for Kentucky, and for the spirit of progress, not only 
in Kentucky, but, hopefully, throughout the South. It is the promise of a new era 
in the history of humanity.” | 
GENERAL CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE COLORED PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
The great obstacle to the progress of the country colored schools is the poverty of 
the people. ‘The State furnishes enough to pay the teacher for a two to four months’ 
term; all the other funds, for building schoolhouses and maintaining the schools, 
they must generally raise themselves. On account of the lack of means the colored 
people are put to all sorts of shifts for bttildings, often using churches, sometimes 
putting up with the most miserable accommodations or going without a school 
altogether. Such reports as the following are frequent: ‘‘Schoolhouses bad ;” ‘The 
greatest trouble is want of money to build houses;” ‘‘The problem of comfortable 
houses for them is hard to solve;” ‘‘The colored schools of this county are at a low 
ebb, with no houses, and the people unable to build;” “It is almost impossible for 
them to build schoolhouses;” “They are too poor to build by taxation;” ‘Few 
have any tax-list, except a poli; hence the law allowing a tax to build is, for them, 
practically no tax at all.” No doubt in some cases the want of suitable school build- 
ings is a result of indolence or a lack of appreciation of the benefits of education, 
but there can be no doubt that poverty is the prevailing cause. 
Other obstacles to negro education are the lack of qualified teachers and the size 
of the colored school districts, the latter especially in those States having a sparse 
colored population. Lewis County, Ky., 800 square miles in extent, forms a single 
colored school district. Of course in such a case it is not possible to locate the school- 
house so that more than a few of the children can attend. The others are entirely 
deprived of school privileges.. This condition of affairs—lorg distances to school— 
is of frequent occurrence, and it is not easy to imagine any remedy that can be de- 
vised to meet it. It is a condition of affairs that obtains in any thinly settled coun- 
try, though bearing with special hardships upon the colored people, who are virtually 
deprived of the resource of home education. 
With all these difficulties, however, the outlook is full of promise. It is only by 
comparing the present with the past—the schools of to-day with the condition of a 
people emerging from a state of human bondage and dense ignorance—that a proper 
estimate may be made of the ground that has been gained. Thirty years ago it was 
frequently an indictable offense to ‘‘teach or cause to be taught any slave or free 
person of color to read or write.” As late as 1863, in the State of Delaware, a posi- 
tive enactment was made against all assemblages for the instruction of colored people.
-P-A-G-E-755
  EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1417 
Now nearly one and a quarter million colored pupils daily attend the public schools 
and receive the rudiments of education, mainly at the expense of the white people 
of the South. 
Further improvement is to be looked for on the lines already laid down. The 
teaching force is improving each year. The various colored normal, secondary, and 
superior institutions furnish their annual contingent to swell the ranks of the teach- 
ers. ‘The standing of their teachers in point of morals and learning is constantly 
grewing better.” ‘There is trouble securing teachers who can pass required examina- 
tions, but they are doing better on this point, and it is thought this impediment will 
soon disappear.” Except in the event of assistance being granted by the Federal Gov- 
ernment, it is to themselves that the colored people of the rural districts must look 
for means to supplement the State funds and to improve and extend their present 
school system. Signs are not wanting that substantial progress is being made in this 
direction. With the bettering of their material condition comes a fuller desire for 
intellectual training. 
The reports of Superintendent Pickett, of Kentucky, furnish the most definite 
information on this point. One county superintendent says: ‘‘ The (colored) common 
schools are improving in every respect. The grade of teachers is much better, school- 
houses are being improved, the people see that they can not get along without the 
common schools, but rely too much on the public fund.” 
Another: ‘ Without education themselves, the colored people, with a devotion 
truly heroic and a self-sacrifice truly philanthropic, are making an effort to obtain 
for their children those blessings they have not enjoyed.” 
Another: ‘During the year a good schoolhouse has been built, and the interest 
is greatly increased. 
Another: ‘‘The attendance during the last school year was better than ever befofe. 
A greater number of schoolhouses was built, and a larger amount supplementing the 
teachers’salaries was raised than ever before.” 
Another: ‘‘The colored people are laboring with commendable zeal to improve 
their schools. * * * Taxes have been levied in three districts to improve the 
houses.” 
THE NEGRO SCHOOLS OF MISSOURI. 
The following information regarding negro education in Missouri is taken from the 
report of State Superintendent W. E. Coleman (1888-89) : 
“The negro schools are gradually increasing in numbers and efficiency. This may 
be attributed to the fact that, in addition to the teachers supplied by Lincoln insti- 
tute and the high schools in.the Jarger cities of the State, many educated negroes 
come to Missouri in search of positions as teachers, who have been educated in North- 
ern States, in the same schools with the white children, but who are not permitted to 
teach in said States. 
“Missouri has now more than 700 negro teachers employed in her public schools. 
These, of course, teach only negro children; but this is 700 more negro teachers than 
are empioyed in seven of the Northern States, and, in fact, more than are employed 
in the public schools of all the old free States. 
“Experience has proven that those negroes who have lived in the South, and who 
are well educated, made better teachers than those who have lived altogether in the 
North. They get along better with both the whites and the negroes. . 
“Our law-makers have favored the negro children by legislation. While they do 
not have, as a general rule, so well-equipped schoolhouses, they are granted special 
privileges in other particulars that are denied to the white children of the district. 
To form a district for white children requires thirty children of school age; but if 
there aro fifteen colored children in any school district the board is required and 
compelled to maintain a separate school for them for the same length of time the 
school for the while children is insession. White children who have no school facili- 
ties, who live in unorganized territory, if they attend a public school, have to pay 
tuition, while, at the same time, their parents are compelled to pay a four-mill school 
tax which goes to the organized districts of the county; but negro children, in a dis- 
trict with less than fifteen negro children by the last enumeration, are permitted to 
go to any negro school in the county free, and the district in which they reside must 
pay their tuition. This is not a privilege only; it is an absolute right they have un- 
der the law. Still we have a few negro fanatics, agitators, and would-be philanthro- 
pists, who are continually trying to stir up confusion and contention because a few 
negro children happen to live in districts remote from a negro school. ‘They grow 
furious if the children have to walk two or three miles, while there are ten times as 
many white children who walk as far, and some farther, to attend their own district 
schools. The question is often asked, “How do the negro children learn?” Are 
they as apt as the white children? No, might be given as a definite answer; but 
that does not satisfy. The truth isthere are not 1,000 full-blooded African children 
in the schools of this State. The negro population of Missouri isan amalgamated 
     
-P-A-G-E-756
         EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-80. 
race of people, i which the genuine negro and the Caucasian races have been mixed; 
and it is a fact, hat can not be consistently denied, that when you have the oppor- 
tunity to test the ability of the negro school children from six years old until they 
reach twenty it will become apparent that as they advance in the grades, from the 
primary department to graduation in the high school, the African characteristics 
drop out and the Caucasian predominate, thereby showing conclusively that the 
African is not capable of receiving and utilizing the school advantages afforded him 
with the readiness and to the extent of the Caucasian. Among the 700 negro teachers 
in Missouri, there are not ten of purely African antecedents. 
‘There are still a few communities in which the freeholders prefer to rent and 
lease their lands to negroes rather than to have white tenants occupy them, but who 
do everything in their power to deprive the negroes of their legal rights relative to 
schools and school privileges. The negroes are poor and can not afford to go to law, 
but submit, and their children are thereby defrauded out of their just rights, rights 
which are guarantied to them by the laws of the State. My theory is that any com- 
munity that prefers negro tenants should be compelled to support good schools for 
the children of such negro tenants.” ' 
CAPACITY OF THE NEGRO FOR EDUCATION. 
i E 
The question of the capacity of the negro to receive education, which Superin- 
tendent Coleman touches upon in the preceding extract, has been often discussed. 
Mr. W. H. Baker, superintendent of the public schools of Savannah, Ga., asserted 
upon this point: ‘“Idesire to have it known that, as a result of my observation, 
which has been extensive, I am convinced that the colored people are exceedingly 
anxious to educate their children. The colored children in the schools of this city’ 
are making rapid progress. They not only show ability for learning what are termed 
the elementary branches, but seem to grasp without difficulty those studies which 
are included in the curriculum of what is classed as secondary education. I write 
this because for many years I held a contrary opinion.” 
The superintendent of Fleming County, Kentucky, reports: ‘The children ad- 
vanced as rapidly as did those of the average white schools. Experience is teaching 
that the colored children can be almost as well educated, and in nearly the same time, 
as the white ;” and from another county comes the following: ‘‘ Colored people are 
taking more interest and advancing more rapidly in common school education than 
the whites”; and again: ‘‘ The colored people greatly appreciate school privileges, 
and have made greater progress, under the circumstances, than have the whites.” 
John B. Cary, late superintendent of the public schools of Richmond, Va., in his 
account of the twentieth anniversary of the Richmond Colored Normal School, said : 
“As the subjects indicate, the exercises were of an interesting character, and clearly 
refuted the idea of those who maintain that the negro is incapable of mental culture. 
When itis known that our colored schools correspond in grades, instruction, and dis- 
cipline with the white, subject to the eure tales and regulations, it will be conceded, 
I think, that the people of Richmond are doing their full duty by them.”

  EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE, 1425 
Some idea of the work of Central Tennessee College may be obtained from the 
following extract taken from the catalogue of 1889-90; 
“A large portion of the students have been teachers and are at school preparing 
for better work. Others are getting ready to teach. Most of these have charge of 
Sunday schools in connection with day schools, thus aiding in the religious instruc- 
tion of the communities where they labor. Hundreds of students educated here are 
working among their people as advocates of total abstinence from all intoxicating 
liquors and tobacco. Most of them are professed Christians, and infuse the Chris- 
tian spirit into their work. Some are successful preachers in the different branches 
of Methodism, as well as in other denominations. Over 100 have been graduated in 
the medical department, and most of them are now practicing successfully. There 
are more than 5,000,000 of colored people in the South who are asking for more com- 
petent teachers, better educated lawyers, doctors, and preachers who can teach the 
people; better educated farmers and mechanics, and more enlightened wives and 
mothers to elevate the home life of the entire people.” 
Rev. H. M. Tupper, of Shaw University, Raleigh, N. C., says: 
“Essentially the same methods and system of grading have been followed as in 
_ previous years. In the cook and dining rooms 102 girls have received instruction 
and been employed 1 hour per day under an experienced matron, and the improve- 
ment in order, neatness, and efficiency has been marked; also more interest and 
desire to excel on the part of the young ladies have been manifest than during any 
previous year. The same may be said in regard to the department of sewing, which 
is under the supervision of a very competent instructor in the different branches of 
needlework. Plain sewing is first taught, then cutting and putting together plain 
garments, the making of buttonholes; also systematic dressmaking and various 
kinds of fancy work. This department is well graded, and the pupils are advanced 
according to their proficiency. The results of the year, on the whole, have been 
most gratifying. 
“In the male department there have been four teachers, and instruction has been 
given in carpentry, furniture-making, house-painting, whitewashing, kalsomining, © 
and glazing. Others have engaged in mason work, landscape-gardening, and care 
of grounds. In this way we supply every want of the school, manufacturing all 
kinds of furniture needed, and repairing and doing any kind of carpenters’ work. 
About 200 young men have been given instruction and employed in the different 
departments of industrial work, and we propose early next session to establish a 
printing department, as the tendency is, in some kinds of our industrial work, that 
the classes are crowded, making it difficult for the teacher to give the needed super- 
vision and instruction. 
“In reviewing the history of our industrial work in all its phases and bearings, 
I pronounce it a grand success, second in importance to no other department of the 
school, and I am doing my best from year to year to introduce such improvements 
as will more and more accomplish the best possible results. I find it requires 
experience, patience, and no little amount of firmness and energy to maintain a 
high standard of efficiency in the several departments of industrial work, even 
more effort than is necessary to secure excellence in the literary departments of the 
school.” 
Rust University, Holly Springs, Miss.: 
“Tn the department of shoemaking twenty-eight young men have been instructed 
during the year, and the result proves to be in advance of our expectations. 
“Tn the department of carpentry fifty-thrée young men have been instructed in 
the use of tools. With the advantages gained by the erection of a new industrial 
hall, which will be completed in a few weeks, much greater progress in both shoe- 
making and carpentry is promised. 2 
“In typesetting nine young men and seven young women have worked, and not 
only gained knowledge under the faithful instruction of an experienced printer, but 
as well sent out about 1,000 copies of Rust Enterprise monthly, the work of which 
proves their interest and efficiency. 
“The nurse-training department has done excellent work. Sixteen young women 
have been carefully and systematically instructed. This is a department that needs 
development to meet the actual demands of the times. With a prescribed course of 
study of 4 years we expect to make this a power for good.” 
LeMoyne Institute, Memphis, Tenn.: 
«‘This school commands the confidence and respect of all. Among the best teachers 
in public schools in the Mississippi Valley on both sides of the river are the grad- 
uates of LeMoyne Institute.” 
Meharry Medical Department of Central Tennessee College, Nashville, Tenn. : 
“This school has conferred the degree of M. D. on one hundred and four young 
men, nearly all of whom are now engaged in the successful practice of their profes- 
sion. They have been kindly received by the white physicians, whose uniform tes- 
timony is that the colored physicians sent out by this school give evidence of very 
thorough preparation for their work. 
ED 89——90     
   
-P-A-G-E-764
H ‘ \ . 
“In each of the Southern States south of Virginia one or more of our graduates 
are now practicing medicine, and in quite a number of Southwestern States. Their 
record is one that no college need be ashamed of.” 
President Tupper says of the work of Leonard Medical School of Shaw University, 
Raleigh, N. C., and on the general subject of colored men in medicine: 
“The graduates of last year more than met expectations, and won for themselves 
much honor before the North Carolina and Virginia State medical boards, Only one 
* failed to pass, while others stood among the first in scholarship. Before the North 
Carolina medica] board, in a class of some forty white applicants for license to practice 
medicine, one of the graduates of the Leonard Medical School led the class in six 
branches of medicine, but failed in two questions in chemistry. One thing has been 
clearly proved, that the best minds among the colored people can sticcessfully master 
the different branches of medicine and make good physicians, but the medical men     
find it more difficult, perhaps, the fault to some extent being in their preliminary ~ 
training, and in such cases the only safe remedy seems to be to allow the student to 
remain after the expiration of the 4 years’ course until he can bring himself up to 
our standard of graduation. 
“This is fair to the student and avoids the danger of letting loose on the com- 
munity a class of graduates who haye continued in school the prescribed number of 
years, but have not thoroughly mastered the different branches of medicine. In this 
connection, I wish to bear testimony that in a long experience as student and teacher 
‘Ihave never seen yourg men make so earnest and persistent efforts to succeed in 
their studies and qualify themselves for their profession, and we have to introduce 
restraints to protect their health rather than incentives to industry and study. 
“ During the past year we have raised the standard of qualifications for entrance 
into our medical school, and several who were expecting to be admitted were re- 
quired to spend an extra year in preliminary studies, and yet the new class is a third 
larger than any preceding one. | 
“All of our graduates thus far have settled in the larger cities of the South, and 
without a single exception have readily entered into a good practice, and have the 
confidence of the colored people and the good-will and respect of the white phy- 
sicians.” 
From catalogue of Atlanta University, 1889-90: . 
_ “Nearly all the graduates and many others who have left before finishing their 
course are engaged in teaching during a part or all of the year. Besides these, 
during the 4 months of the summer vacation a large number of students engage 
in teaching, and it is estimated that over 10,000 children in Georgia are uae 
annually by those who have been connected with the institution.” 
From report of B. T. Washington, president of the Tuskegee (Alabama) Colored 
Normal School: | 
“While the air is full of speculation as to the solution of the ‘Negro problem,’ it 
seems to me that the fact that a negro normal school of 400 students could exist for 
8 years in the midst of a white community with perfect good feeling on all sides 
proves that the problem left to the judgment of the commonsensed and conservative 
among both races will soon solve itself. Education of the right kind is the only solu- 
  ‘ tion of the race problem. | 
- ing, wheelwrighting, blacksmithing, saw-mill work, carpentry, painting, plastering, “Fight years’ éxperience of bam pining ae and industrial training proves (1) that 
the two can be so combined as not to hinder the mental training; (2) that enough 
profitable work can be done by the students to materially decrease their boardin, 
expenses; (3) that the habits of industry growing out of an industrial training stic' 
to the students after they graduate and prevent their becoming ‘stuck-up’ loafers 
when not teaching; (4) that the industrial training tends in the highest degree to 
develop moral character. The industries taught at present are farming, brick-mak- 
brickmasonry, printing, mattress-making, harness-making, sewing, laundry work, 
cooking, and general housekeeping. Students work at these industries on an aver- 
age of 1} days in each week and are in the class-room the remainder of the time.” 
The catalogue of Southern University, New Orleans, La., 1889-90, says of the in- 
dustrial department: \ 
“This department, organized 4 years ago, is receiving much commendation. It 
has proven a success, and is a department that reflects great credit on the pupils. 
“A large number of girls have learned to make garments, rugs, and household arti- 
cles of various kinds. This work is regularly and systematically graded, beginning 
with the plain and simple and advancing to the costly and intricate. The pupils 
furnish their own materials. | 
“Students in this department are tsbonahie instructed in all manner of needle- 
work and in cutting and fitting. Those who coniplete a course in this department 
receive a certificate stating the same. We design the addition of such industries as 
will afford them the means of earning an honorable and competent livelihood.”

high, has been erected for the industrial department. The boys are taught carpentry, 
wheelwrighting, painting, and harness-making. Inthe printing office they are in- 
structed in that business. The girls are taught to be trained nurses, and in cooking, 
dressmaking, cutting, ete. 
At Fisk University, Nashville, Tenn., a printing office has been furnished by a special 
appropriation from the John F, Slater fund, and instruction is annually given to 
fifteen young men in the various kinds of work that belong to a job office. 
Instruction in wood-working is also given under the direction of a graduate of the 
mechanical department of Pennsylvania State College. Two hours each week are 
given to working in wood, and the results of the first year’s efforts have been quite 
satisfactory, and the influence on general scholarship has been beneficial. 
In the nurse-training department the students have been taught the right methods 
of caring for the sick and those who have met with accidents, and in the laws of 
hygiene. Instruction has also been given in cooking and in the nutritive values of 
the different foods and their comparative cost. Dressmaking and plain sewing have 
also béen.taught. 
The catalogue for 1839-90 of Atlanta University contains a list of the graduates 
from 1871 to 1889, inclusive, and also the business of each, so far as learned Of the’ 
148 persons whose names are given, 120 are teachers, 9 preachers, and 19 are engaged. 
in other pursnits. | 
“The boys of the college, college preparatory, and normal classes, and the first two

‘The boys are also taught some of the principles of farming and gardening. At-

Separaté schools for the two races are required. (Sch. L’s, 1885, p. 29, sec. 52.) 
Also required by the Constitution. (Sch. L’s, 1885, p. 3, sec. 1.) 
The poll taxes ($1.50 on each male citizen between 21 and 45 gents of age, collected 
in each county, shall be retained therein for the public schools thereof. (Sch. L’s, 
1885, p. 6, par. 6.) 
Poll taxes paid by each race in each township or school district must be used for 
that race in that township or district. (Sch. L’s, 1-85, p. 32, sec. 60.) 
The State superintendent of education shall apportion the school fund according 
to school population to each township or district, and for each race therein. (Sch. 
L’s, 1885, p. 30, sec. 56, et seq.) 
The whole amount apportioned in 1888-89 was $370,420.56, of which the 273,994 
white children received $204,911.93, and the 212,931 colored children received $165,- 
508.63; 74.8 cents for each white child and 77.7 cents for each colored child. (Sch, 
Rep., 1889, p. 107.) The whole amonnt disbursed, including local funds, was $690,- 
390,22 (p. 10). 
According to the school laws published in 1835 (p. 12) the teachers were paid by 
the county superintendents quarterly. It seems that by the present laws they are 
paid directly from the State treasury, the county superintendents simply delivering 
the money sent to each teacher. (Rep. of 1888, p. 27, and Rep. of. 1886, p. 19.) 
“All local school funds raised for the support of public schools, by taxation or 
otherwise, shall be apportioned and expended in the district or districts where such 
funds have been raised, under such rules and regulations as the district superintend- 
ent of public schools of said district, or other local board provided by law, may 
prescribe; but this section shall not be construed to repeal any provision for the 
apportionment and disbursement of the moneys mentioned in this article [Art. 
VII], provided for in special or local laws” (Sch. L’s, 1885, p. 34). 
In addition to the $165,508.63 apportioned to the colored schools, they were entitled 
to the poll taxes paid by colored voters. From these funds colored teachers were 
aid $201,217.82, and, in addition, $7,000 were paid to colored normal schools. (See 
ep. 1889, p. 10.) This gives $1.14 to each white child and 98 cents to each colored

child. It is probable that a larger proportion of the colored vo'ers failed to pay the 
poll tax, as was trae in North Carolina, where a record was kept of the poll-tax 
reeripts from each race. \ 
The apportionment in 1686-88, was as follows: White children (251,606), $190,- 
182.45, or 76 cents for each; colored children (201,331), $156,684.87, or 78 cents for 
each. (See Rep. 1388, p. 100.) — 
The disbursements of State fund, including poll tax, wasas follows: White teach- 
ers and normal schools, $304,384.40, or $1.21 for each child. Colored teachers and 
normal schools, $207,380.42, or $1.03 for each child. (See Rep. 1883, p. 8.) 
“In making the apportionment of school money to the several school districts the 
superintendent of education shall first set apart to each township or other school 
district the amount due from the State to each district as interest on its sixteenth- 
section fund, or other trust fund held by the State; and all townships or school dis- 
tricts which have an income from trust funds in the hands of the State, or from lease 
or sale of their sixteenth-section lands, shall not receive anything out of the balance 
of the educational fund to be apportioned until all other townships or school dis- 
tricts having no trust fund shall have received from the general fund such sum as 
will give them an equal per capita apportionment with the townships and districts 
having such trusts and incomes. : E 
“The superintendent of education shall apportion the educational fund to the 
respective townships or school districts subject to the provisions of the preceding sec- 
tion, according to the latest official returns of the enumeration of school population 
of the townships or other districts which have been made to his office ; and he shall 
also apportion the fund for each township between the races therein; but whenever 
the superintendent of any township or district has failed to make and return the 
census enumeration of his township or district, as required by law, the superintendent 
of education shall make the apportionment to such township or district according to 
the best information he can obtain as to the school population of such townships 
or district; but in no event shall he, in case of such failure, estimate the school 
population of any such district or township'at more than the number shown by the 
last official report thereof to his office. 
“As soon as the superintendent of education shall have made the apportionment 
of school money as hereinabove provided, he shall record the same in his office in 
books kept for that purpose, showing the amount which he has apportioned to each 
school district in the State, and specifying from what source or sources the same was 
derived, the amount to each race in the township, and the number of children of 
each race in the district upon which the apportionment was based; and he shall 
then furnish to each county superintendent of education a certified copy from such 
books, showing the dividends of educational fund to each township or district under, 
the supervision of such county superintendent of education, and the amount so 
divided and certified shall be the total amount which each of such school districts 
shall be entitled to receive from the State, except the poll tax, during the then cur- 
rent scholastic year; and no contract to pay for any school or schools, for any dis- 
trict, more than the amount thus apportioned to it, together with such poll tax as it] 
may receive, and such funds as may be in hand from previous years, shall be valid 
against the State or township.” (pp. 30-31, secs. 55-57.)

“By act of April 24, 1882, the annual ‘capitation tax of one dollar on each male 
colored person above the age of twenty-one years,’ for the benefit of the colored 
schools, was repealed by the general assembly. In view of the tax being confined to 
the colored people, although exclusively for the benefit of the colored schools, it had ‘ 
been pronounced unconstitutional by the United States district court. The abolition . 
of this tax, which had been the most fruitful source of support to the colored schools, ; 
was the main cause of the reduction of the anditor’s estimate of $41,644.52 for the oa 
school year 1882, to $12,607.78 for the school year 1883, which alone, not deducting a 
the contingent expenses of the department, would have yielded a per capita of only 
$0.13. Just at this crisis the act levying an additional ‘tax of two cents on each one 
hundred dollars of property in this Commonwealth subject to taxation for State rey- 
enue purposes,’ for the benefit of the common-school fund, equalizing the per capita 
and the school ages for the white and the colored school children, was aabintead coe \ 
authority of the general assembly to the qualified yoters of the Commonwealth for 
their ratification or their rejection. The act was confirmed by the people at the polls.”

“Sxo. 3. The comptroller shall apportion the sum appropriated for the support of 
the colored schools of the several counties and the city of Baltimore in proportion to 
their respective colored population between the ages of five and twenty years, said 
apportionment te be made at the time he apportions the levy for the white schools. 
“Sec. 4. The total amount of taxes paid for school purposes by the colored people

In 1888-89 the amount of the State school tax appropriated for the 226,806 white 
children was $405,001.02, which was $1.78 for each white child; the amount appro- 
priated for colored children was $118,049.77, which gave $1.72 for each one of the 
68,409 colored children. It is not shown whether any part of the free-school and 
academic funds was given to the colored schools, but it appears that none of it was 
so bestowed. (Sch. Rep., 1889, p. XLIX.) 
The legislature enacted in 1888 “that the sum appropriated to colored schools 
shall be raised from $100,000 to $125,000 : Provided, Thatif the amount paid into the 
treasury on account of the tax for public schools shall not amount to $125,000, then

the number of months the school shall be held in the district, the number of teachers 
that may be employed in the several subdistricts, and fix the salaries that shall be 
paid to the teachers. In determining the salaries they shall have regard to the. 
grade of teachers’ certificates, fixing to each grade the salary that shall be paid to 
teachers.of said grades in the several subdistricts.” (Sec. 6.) 
The attorney-general held that the above section requires that all the teachers in 
a district holding certificates of the same grade must be paid the same salary. 
(See p. 57.) | 
“White and colored persons shall not be taught in the same school; but to afford 
to colored children the benefits of a free-school education, it shall be the duty of the 
trustees of every subdistrict to establish therein one or more primary schools for 
colored persons between the ages of six and twenty-one years whenever the number 
of such persons residing therein, and between the ages aforesaid, exceeds fifteen, ac- 
cording to the enumeration made for school purposes. The trustees of two or more 
snbdistricts, whether in the same or adjoining districts or counties, may, by agree- 
ment with each other, join in establishing a primary school for colored children 
residing in said subdistricts, and such school so established shall be subject to the 
same regulations as are provided for the schools for white children in section twelve 
of this chapter. | : ; 
‘‘ Whenever, in any school district, the benefit of a free-school education is not se- 
cured to the colored children residing therein, in the manner mentioned in the pre- 
ceding section, the fund applicable to the support of free schools in such subdistrict, 
whether received from the State or local taxation, shall be divided by the board of 
education in the proportion which the number of colored children bears to. the num- 
ber of white children therein, according to the latest enumeration made for school 
\ purposes; and the share of the former shall be set apart for the education of colored

        CHAPTER XXXII. 
STATISTICS OF PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN 
FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
| 7 
REMARKS UPON THE TABLE. 
The following table presents the statistics of public elementary schools, excluding 
infant schools, in countries whose official reports have been received in this Office. 
Statistics of enrollment—The totals of enrollment, column 5, must not be under- 
stood as including all children receiving elementary instruction; it is simply the 
number of children who have availed themselves of the public-school provision. An 
endeayor has been made in another part of this Report (pp. 76, 77) to show the num- 
ber of children receiving instruction from all sources in several countries. 
While in many countries very nearly the whole school population resorts to public 
schools, in other countries parochial or church schools bear an equal or possibly 
even greater part in the work; private nonparochial schools patronized by the 
wealthy exist in all countries, and in all home instruction supplies the place of school 
instruction for a small percentage of the population. In Great Britain it is assumed 
that one-seventh of the population will depend wholly upon private agencies for 
instruction, and the remaining six-sevenths are made the basis for estimating the 
amount of public-school accommodation to be supplied. 
It is extremely difficult to deal with the statistics reported officially for Austria 
on account of the various classes of schools which participate in the work of ele- 
mentary instruction. The official report presents the educational status of the entire 
school population ; that is, the youth six to fourteen years of age. The total number 
is given as 3,295,552. The number reported as attending the public Volksschulen, i. e., 
people’s schools, is used in the table before us, In addition to this number, viz, 
2,748,347, tliere were in private Volksschulen 107,627, and in small elementary schools 
1,695 pupils. There were also 50,628 youths of school age in attendance upon higher} 
Volksschulen, or receiving instruction at home; 365,218 children are said to have been 
without instruction; leaving asmall percentage who are classed as incapacitated by 
reason of bodily or mental infirmity, 
For Great Britain and France enrollment in church schools is included in column 
5 of the table. In the former these schools share with board schools in the public 
grant aud are classed as public elementary schools; in the latter they are unde 
the supervision of the Government, although not supported by public funds. Th 
official reports for Ireland give the total enrollment, including all children who hay 
made a single attendance upon the schools during the year. For 1888 this numbe 
was 1,060,895. The enrollment, as given in the table, includes only the pupils wh 
may be presented for examination, and in respect of whom grants may be claimed 
that is, pupils who made at least one attendance within the last 14 days precedin 
the Government examinaticn. | 
The conflict between church and state authorities in several countries, notably i 
Belgium and the Netherlands, has caused great fluctuations in the attendance i 
public or state schools in recent years, For instance the enrollment for Belgium i: 
very nearly double that reported in 1834-85 (vide Rep. of Commissioner, 1826-87). 
The triumph of the antiliberal party in 1884 caused a radical change in the sch 
policy. “A new school law was passed allowing church schools to share in the publi 
funds upon certain conditions, and in many ways strengthening the influence of th 
clergy in educational affairs. The result was a decline in public-school attendance 
which is now, however, again upon the increase. 
Teachers.—Pupil-teachers are employed in England and Wales, Scotland, Ne 
South Wales, and Japan, and are included in the totals of teachers for those countri | 1440

Financial statistics—The expenditures given in column 16 of the table rélate to the 
schools comprised in the table. The chief item in these expenditures is always the 
amount paid for teachers’ salaries. In addition to this and incidental expenses, 
viz, the cost of ‘books and material supplies, the costs of inspection, compulsion, and 
* other administrative expenses are included in column 16. The totals presented in 
this column do not in every case comprise the entire amount given in the original 
reports under the head of expenditure for primary education. The differences arise 
in some cases from the fact that appropriations for special purposes, as pension funds, 
scholarship funds, ete., included in the original reports, are excluded from the totals 
here used. In other cases the original reports have classed as elementary, schools 
that do not come within the scope of this table, as infant schools, normal schools, etc. 
The expenditures for these have been subtracted from the totals used in column 16, 
excepting in the case of Belgium, whose reports do not‘give an itemized statement. 
_ Here expenditure for normal schools is included in the total for primary instruction. 
It should be observed that by far the larger proportion of the amounts expended 
always goes for teachers’ salaries and the current incidental expenditures common to 
allsystems. The special expenditures included for a few countries do not materially 
affect the relative bearing of the facts.

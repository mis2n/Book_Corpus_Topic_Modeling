Report. 
Six months have not yet elapsed since my appointment to 
the duties and responsibilities of the office, made vacant by 
the death of that excellent man, Dr. Doak. To be called on 
suddenly to take up the work which fell from his hands, 
and to push it on vigorously as he had done, was exceedingly 
painful and embarrassing. In so short a time, it has been 
impossible to gain such an acquaintance with our educational 
machinery as to run it wisely and efficiently. Neither time 
nor money has been spared in seeking the needful help and 
information. Nor have I been disappointed in the search. 
Everywhere I have found friends, many of them strong and 
holding positions which rendered them capable. of doing me.” / 
valuable service. Their sympathy and assistangé,’s0 cheer-   
  
   5 
fully extended, have been a source of comfort and guoyment 
as well as encouragement. And I now take’ this opportunity 
of expressing to them my sincere thanks. , Especially’ am,I 
indebted to Gen. John Eaton, of the Burea6! of Education, 
Dr, H. R. Waite, of the Census Office, and.’Hon. J. L. M. 
Curry, Agent of the Peabody Education Fund. 
The people of the State, as well as myself,/owe a wi ef 
gratitude to Miss Julia A. Doak, for the able manner in Wh ch! 
she discharged the duties of this office during the time of her 
father’s sickness and death. And as soon as she had seen 
him laid away in the tomb, she returned in grief and loneli- 
ness to the office. where quietly and faithfully she attended 
to the business during the interval between her father’s death 
and the appointment of his successor. 
The report, which is now made to the public concerning 
the last year’s work, is very defective. No one can realize 
this more than I. But it is the best that could be done with 
the material furnished me. 
The reports from the county superintendents indicate some 
improvement in the work of free schools, From all the tes-
-P-A-G-E-6
6 
timony received, we are persuaded that the system of free 
schools has become so acceptable to the people, in all parts 
of the State, that they could by no means be induced to aban- 
don it. Their intelligence and appreciation have so increased, 
that they no longer consider it an open question whether 
public schools shall be maintained ; but they are, in many 
places, beginning to demand that improvements shall be 
made on the present system. so as to adapt it to the present 
circumstances and requirements of the people. whose feel- 
ings and opinions are very different from those which they 
entertained ten or eleven years ago. Then it required the 
greatest caution and good sense to devise a school system 
that would be at all acceptable to the people. Doubtless this 
very fact led the framers of the school law to put almost the 
whole power and management in their hands. By vesting 
the county courts and school directors with nearly all the 
power and responsibility. they succeeded in pleasing the 
common people, and induced them to espouse a cause in 
which they hoped to figure largely as leaders and champions. 
Certainly this was the best thing to do at that time, but 
Roy at ange is coming, and a strong conviction is abroad 
that more’ éxecutive authority should be embodied in the sys- 
tem, in order to secure more uniformity and co-operation . 
throughout the State. The system, as it now stands, is beset 
with wealcness and complication. As this fact is generally 
understood, and -ag my term of service will soon expire, so . 
that no one-can charge me with baving any further interest 
ithe matter than every good citizen should have. I venture 
to make the few following suggestions: :    
‘resp, The Legislature should provide for the appointment of 
a board of education, composed of wise and intelligent edu-~ 
cators, who should be authorized and required by law to se- 
lect and adopt for the Public Schools of the State a uniform 
series of text-books. Twenty per cent. on the cost of books 
might be saved in this way. [It would put a stop to the an- 
noyance coming from changes and the fear of changes. And 
then what a relief it would afford to many firms, whose agents 
are everywhere in the earth and walking up and down in it. 
Itmay be said that some publisher will manipulate the State: 
board in-his own- interest, and thus frustrate -the whole:plan: 
and purpose. This is possible. But isit reasonable’ to sup- - 
pose that a State board will be: more easily bribed ordeceived 
than! aboard of ‘school directors? “If this can not be obtajni- 
 
-P-A-G-E-7
7 
ed, then let authority be granted to each county to adopt for 
itself a uniform series of text-books. At present, every 
school district may have its own series. The consequence is, 
every scheol is a babel. 
2d, Some means more efficient should be employed for 
compelling County Trustees to make their reports to the 
County Superintendents at the time required by law. For no 
other reason than this, reports from County Superintendents 
have been delayed for weeks beyond the appointed time. 
The County Trustee should be held accountable to the County 
Superintendent for all the school money assessed by county 
and State. This would establish a business relation between 
them, so that the Trustee would become interested in making 
a settlement with the Superintendent. 
3d. The school fund should be distributed in’ such a way 
as to secure to every child, in a given district, the same num- 
ber of school days as is enjoyed by the children living in the 
other districts of the same county. By the present system 
great injustice is done. two school districts in the same 
county, lying side by side, are taxed exactly alike; but in one 
district there are twice as many children as in the other, and 
the one with the greater number has twice as many school 
days as the other. Anybody can sec the unfairness in this. 
Prof. F. M.. Smith, of Knox county is the only county super- 
intendent I know of who has succeeded in defeating such a 
course of injustice. 
  4th. The County Superintendent should be required to ap 
prove all warrants drawn on the County Trustee for the pay- 
ment of school funds. This would enable the County Super- 
intendent to keep the directors out of debt. It would prevent 
swindlers from imposing on school directors. and selling 
to them worthless apparatus. I would enable the County 
Superintendent to get correet reports from all the teachers at 
the proper time, by withholding his signature from the war- 
rants drawn for their last month's payment until they have 
brought in their reports. It would enableCounty Superin- 
tendents to gather statistics in due time to make out their 
reports to the State Superintendent, and would also give them 
better control of the schools under their charge: 
5th. The Legislature should appropriate money to sustain 
six normal institutes, three for the whites and three for the 
blacks, one of each kind to be held for four weeks in each 
grand division of the State. Several of the best and most 
   
-P-A-G-E-8
8 
energetic educators in the State declare that with fifteen 
hundred dollars these institutes could be sustained and made 
eminently useful in imparting thorough and needful instruc- 
tion to that large class of teachers who are too poor and too 
timid to attend the State Normal Institute held at Knoxville. 
These institutes, along with the State Normal College, would 
in a few years give us an adequate supply of competent 
teachers. I hope the Legislature will give this suggestion a 
favorable consideration, and that they may see it to be a prof- 
itable investment to appropriate fifteen hundred dollars to 
these institutes; and also to renew their appropriation of ten 
thousand dollars to the State Normal College. 
6th. There is still another point to which I wish to call at- 
ntion. Unless something more is done than has been done, 
it will be almost a century before the amount of illiteracy in 
Tennessee is reduced toa minimum. The number of illiterate 
is about fifty thousand more than in 1870, although the per- 
centage is a trifle less. Are the citizens of Tennesse willing 
to jeopard their moral and material interest by suffering 
this incubus of ignorance to rest upon them for degades to 
come? It should be thrown off as quickly as possible, by 
increased taxation for public schools and by appealing to the 
Federal Government for a liberal appropriation to accomplish 
this work. Wherever I have been 1 have found the people 
willing to receive the appropriation, however averse they may 
be to increased taxation. Occasionally some old political fox 
has interposed objections to it on the ground of its being un- 
constitutional, and tending towards centralization. But the 
old cry of centralization has been made so long and so often 
that there is danger of its becoming obsolete. Decrevit tan- 
dem populus, ut res publica videret ne quid detrimenti 
caperet.

  STATE NORMAL COLLEGE. 
@onvse of Study, Bir. 
Tue State Norma CoLieGeE was opened with appro- 
priate ceremonies at the Capitol, in Nashville, Pennessee, on 
Wednesday, the 1st of December, 1875, and is designed for 
the professional education of teachers, and “ practice in all 
grades of instruction.” It constitutes the Literary Depart- 
ment of thé University of Nashville, but is under the sanction 
of the State of Tennessee. It derives its support at present 
from the funds of the University—the “ Peabody Education 
Fund,” and an appropriation from the State of Tennessee. 
It receives as students young gentlemen and ladies, from any 
of the States, desiring to qualify themselves to teach in and 
conduct schools, and combines with a State normal school 
for Tennessee, a NorMab COLLEGE OF A HIGH GRADE FOR,.

DESIG? 
  The State Normal College is strictiy Professional, and does 
not, where it can possibly be avoided, propose to undertake 
any work which can be as well performed in the ordi- 
nary schools or other institutions, The more thorough and 
complete the previous education of the student, the more 
valuable will be the advantages to be acquired at the College. 
The institution designs to prepare. its students, as far as 
possible, for the organizing, teaching and general manage- 
ment of schools of different grades and higher educational 
institutions, both public and private. To effect this object, 
the 
COURSE OF INSTRUCTIO?D 
  . 
requires that the student should possess a thorough knowl- 
edge—/irst, of the branches of learning required to be taught 
in the different grades of, schools, and which should be, as 
far as possible, previously acquired; and, second, of the most 
economical and. effective methods of teaching those branches. 
Consequently, the course of instr uction embraces a rapid Te- 
view of the more elementary studies with reference to the 
best ways of teaching them. a review of the higher branches 
- of knowledge with the same object, and a careful study of 
such other branches as time and circumstances will permit. 
The Course of Instruction also includes the general man- 
agement of classes and schools. organization, government, 
discipline, etc., ete.. but with a full recognition of the fact 
that no person’s ability in these respects can be properly test- 
ed until he is actually clothed with the responsibilities of the 
school-room. 
The scholastic year is divided into three terms. 
  First Yrar.—Primary and Grammar-school studies, with 
reference to teaching them, viz.: Arithmetic, oral and writ;
-P-A-G-E-14
14 
ten: Algebra, Geography, civil and physical, with Map 
Drawing; English Grammar and Analy History of the 
United States, Physiology and Hygiene, Rhetoric. Etymol- 
ogy, Book-keeping, Free-hand Drawing. 
Seconp Yrar—Geometry, Plane Trigonometry, Geology. 
Zoology. Botany, General History, Moral Science, Latin, Per- 
spective Drawing. 
Turrp Yrar.—Spherical Geometry and Trigonometry, 
Astronomy, Chemistry. Physics, English Literature, History 
and Constitution of the United States. with Civil Govern- 
ment, Latin. Psychology. : '     
  BACCALAUREATE CLASS, 
No students are admitted to this class who have not taken 
the regular senior class studies, etc. at this College. 
Fourtyu YEAR.—Conic Sections, considered geometrical 
Analvtical Geometry, Calculus, English Literature, Latin. 
German, Psychology, Model Drawing and Designing, etc. 
Such changes will be made in the course, from time to 
time, and such studies added as circumstances may require. 
The Latin, French and German Languages are taken ac- 
cording to a parallel course, and taught by the most improved 
modern methods. Drawing, with black-board delineations, 
English Composition, Declamation, Reading. Spelling, De- 
fining, Penmanship. Vocal Music, etc.. and practice in teach- 
ing receive attention throughout the vear. , 
As this is a strictly professional institution, all studies, trom 
the beginning to the end of the course, are taught with spe- 
cial reference to teaching then: and no study or exercise is 
deemed satisfactory which cannot readily be reproduced in 
the same or a better manner. 
  Students are required, in every study, to occupy tempora- 
rily the place of the teacher of the class, subject to the criti- 
cism of both teacher and classmates: and, at appointed times. 
the more advanced students are required to take the charge 
of the whole department, and give 2 short general lesson, 
subject also to c 
  ism. 
All studies are treated upon the topical plan. with such use 
of text-books as may be advisable. 
DISCIPLINE. 
Students are expected to conduct themselves as cultivated 
_tadies and gentlemen, and to submit cheerfully to such rules
-P-A-G-E-15
wn 
as may be prescribed for the regulation of their studies, time. 
and general improvement during their connection with the 
College. If unable or unwilling to do this, they will be re- 
garded as unfit for the responsible duties of the teachers’ 
profession, and will not be retained. 
CERTIFICATES AND DIPLOMA. 
To such students as are able to remain at the institution 
only a portion of the time required for the full course, a cer- 
tificate way be given, stating the time spent at the institution, 
and the general impressions of the teachers. 
Those who complete satisfactorily the first two years of the 
course, Will be entitled to a certificate, signed by the President 
of the State Normal College. ° 
Persons who can remain only a part of the time prescribed. 
and- have an honorable discharge, will be allowed to resume 
and complete the course at a future opportunity. 
The Diploma of the College is given to those only who 
have completed the entire course satisfactorily, and on all such 
the degree of “LicenriarE oF Instruction” is formally 
conferred. A law of the State of Tennessee directs that “the 
possession of such diploma shall cxempt the holder thereot 
from the examination prescribed as a condition precedent to 
employment in the Public Schools of the State.” Similar 
laws have been passed by other States, 
MMF Persons wishing to employ teachers who have been 
trained, wholly or in part, at this College, are advised to in- 
quire in all cases for the candidate’s certificate of attendance, 
or if a graduate for the full diploma: and it is distinctly de- 
clared that these honors are not conferred unless the student 
is deemed worthy of them. In ordinary cases no other testi- 
monial will be given. 
Students holding © scholarships.” ‘who enter the Senior 
Class, are required to remain at the College another year for 
still more advanced studies, and do not receive a diploma un- 
til their course is completed, at which time the usual Bacca- 
ty may be conferred, in addi- 
    laureate degree of the Univ 
tion to that of the regular Licentiate. - 
TERMS, ETC. 
The scholastic year commences on the first Wednesday in 
October, and closes on the last Wednesday in May. The
-P-A-G-E-16
16 
year is divided into three terms, with but one regular vaca- 
tion, 7. ¢,, at the holidays. The daily sessions are short, and 
are designed to be actively employed in recitation, practice, 
etc. All study and preparation for the student’s work is to 
be done at his room. 
LIBRARIES. 
The College has access to the library of the University—a 
select pedagogical library—and to those of the students’ soci- 
eties.    
PHILOSOPHICAL AND CHEMICAL APPARATUS, 
ETC. . 
A large collection of well-selected apparatus is furnished, 
for the illustration of the various branches of Natural Science. 
GEOLOGICAL AND MINERALOGICAL CABINET. 
The College possesses a very valuable and useful collection 
of Minerals and geological specimens, sufficient to illustrate 
the physical properties of all the more important species. 
To this is added a large LrruoLogicaL and PALEON'TOLOGI- 
cAL COLLECTION, containing casts of all the more important 
fossils and extinct species of animals, prepared by Prof. H. 
A. Ward—such as the Megatherium, Pleisiosaurus, Glypto- 
don, ete. 
IMPROVEMENTS. 
During the past year, spacious and commodious rooms 
have been fitted up and assigned to the three literary societies 
severally. A large portion of the principal building has been 
converted into a convenient and clegant chapel, and all class 
rooms are now warmed by steam and carefully ventilated. 
EXPENSES. 
Tuition is at present free. Every student, however, is ex- 
pected to pay, on the second Mondays of December, Febru- 
ary and April, $2.00, for the use of such books as are pro- 
vided by the institution, and towards incidental expenses,
-P-A-G-E-17
17 
BOARD. ETC. 
Board can be obtained in good families at prices varying 
from $15.00 to $20.00 per month, fuel and lights included. 
MAB Steadents are allowed to board only in families ap- 
proved by the President, and are not permitted, to change 
their boarding place without his consent. Gentlemen and 
Ladies will not be allowed to board in the same place, and 
preference will always be given to such as expect but two to 
oceupy the sane room, and take no boarders except those be- 
longing to the Normal College.

  CIRCULAR OF THE GENERAL AGENT OF THE 
PEABODY EDUCATION FUND. 
In view of the want of well established State Normal 
Schools of a-high order in the South, the Trustees of the 
“Peabody Education Fimd ™ contribute a part of the amount 
with supe-   
necessary to maintain a Srare NorMAL CoLiecr 
rior facilities for tustruction, 
They have furthermore established in this College a num- 
ber of ScHoLarsuips. of $200 cach, for the encours 
and aid of students from the different Southern States, whose ment 
    characters, abili 
promise of usefulness as teachers. 
Applicants must have the wegealified reconmendation of 
the State Superintendent of Instruction of their State. be 
accepted by President Stearns, declare their intention to make’ 
teaching a profession, and promise to teach two years, at 
least. in. the Public Schools, if they have opportunity. The 
fact that there are found, cach year, at the Normal College, 
at Nashville, a number of persons holding certificates of ap- 
pointment to Peabody Scholarships, who are discovered, on 
examination at the College, not to have complied, in impor- 
tant respects, with the * Requirements for obtaining and hold- 
ing Peabody Scholarships,” renders it necessary to zge upon 
State Superintennents and the Examiners appointed by them 
the necessity for a more rigid and thorough examination of 
qualifications, moral charac- es, general culture and health give special 
   
  applicants, in respect to litera 
ter, and probable fitness for the teacher's profession. 
The standard of attainment should be sych, in general, as 
is required of a graduate of a first-class city High School. Ef, 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
19 
upon a half year’s trial, reasonable expectations are not met, 
the scholarship will be discontinued. Those who, in charac- - 
ter or acquirements, are evidently unfitted. to be entrusted 
with the education of young persons, must not have the ben- 
efit of Peabody aid. 
Application is to be made to President Stearns, through the 
State Superintendent of Instruction. 
J. L. M. CURRY,

REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING AND HOLD-° 
ING PEABODY SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The applicant for a scholarship must be at least 17 vears 
of age, present to the President of the College a certificate of 
irreproachable moral character, gentlemanly or lady-like hab- 
its, presemed good health, declare his intention to make teach- 
ing a profession, must give a pledge to remain at the College 
two years if the scholarship is continued so long, promise to 
submit cheerfully to all its requirements. in study, discipline, 
etc., and to teach in the Public Schools at least two vears if 
there is opportunity. 
The applicant must obtain from the State Superintend- 
ent of Public Instruction for his State, a certificate that he 
has passed a satisfactory “examination before said Superin- 
tendent, or other competent person duly authorized, in the 
studies required for admission to the second or * middle class” 
at the College. viz.: In Spelling. Reading. Penmanship, 
Grammar and Analysis. Rhetoric, Geography (civil and phys- 
ical), Arithmetic. Algebra. Book-keeping, Physiology, United 
States History. Elements of Geology. No particular text- 
hooks are prescribed for this examination, The candidate 
should give evidence of such knowledge of the above 
fy omitting their further study. Stu- 
dents will also be examined at the College with reference to 
their classification, cte. branches as would jawstifi 
  3. State Superintendents and other examiners are respect- 
fully urged to make the required examination thorough and 
complete, and thus save the candidate from possible rejection 
when he offers himself for acceptance at the College... Exam- 
iners should consider themselves responsible for the persons
-P-A-G-E-20

they recommend. Persons, who fail so far in passing the en- 
trance examination at the College that they cannot make up 
easily and in a reasonably short time all deficiencies, can not 
be received. 
4. Gentlemen or Jadies thus admitted, who complete the 
prescribed course of study and training satisfactorily, gradu- 
ate regularly, and receive from the proper authorities a diplo- 
ma admitting them to the degree. of “LicENTIATE oF IN- 
struction.” (“L, I.”) 
5. Persons desiring to enter the senior class, will be exam- 
ined at the College upon the studies of the middle class, in 
addition to those prescribed above. ‘Such students will not 
graduate with the Senior class, but will pursue s/il/ more ad- 
vanced studies another year; and, if character, attainments, 
etc, justify, will be admitted, at the close of their course, to 
the usual College or University degree of BACHELOR or 
Arts (B, A). None, however, except regular graduates, 
will be admitted to this class, 
6. The Peabody Scholarship money will not be paid until 
the student has been a member of the College one month, at 
which time, and at the close of each succeeding month, $25, 
will be paid, to an amount not exceeding $300 for the year: 
no payment will be made for the fraction of a month. It is 
expected that this money will be appropriated by the student 
to the payment of board and other College expenses, first of 
all; and no certificate or diploma will be granted to any stu- 
dent known to be in arrears in these respects. 
4, These scholarships will, in no case, be contiuued to stu- 
dents whose rank or standing is low, whose general demeanor 
is objectionable, who do not give promsise of usefulness as 
teachers, or whose health or other cireumstances prevent con- 
stant attendance on or performance of College duties. 
8. Students failing to complete their course of study accord- 
ing to the conditions prescribed, or to teach after graduating, 
are required to refund the amount of money they have re- 
ceived from the “ Peabody Education Fund,” to the President 
of the College. 
g. Exprensres.—Gentlemen usually pay from $15 to $18 a 
month for board in approved boarding-houses or private fam. 
ilis. Ladies pay in best private families, #18 to $20 a month. 
$5 a year is paid for the use of such books, etc., as are’ fur- 
nished by the College, and for a portion of the incidental 
expenses, '

The Annual Session opens on the first Wednesday in Oc- 
tober, and closes the last Wednesday in May. There is no 
vacation during the session, except the Christiias holidays. 
MOF Scholarship students will not be received after the 
opening of the session, except in extraordinary cases. 
EBEN S. STEARNS, 
. President, 
In view of the liberality of the Trustees of the Peabody 
Education Fund, and to carry out the design contemplated in 
the above circular more fully, it has been determined to make 
no charge for tuition in the case of those holding “ scholar- 
ships,” and that tuition shall also be free to all students from ~ 
Tennessee, ladies or gentlemen, who intend to fit themselves 
for the teacher’s profession. A. charge, however, of $2,00 
per term will be made in every case for use of books and for 
incidental expenses. , :

During Dr. Doak’s last illness I received several communi- 
cations from Mrs. Doak stating that it was the Doctor’s earn- 
est wish that I should proceed with the preparations: for the 
Normal Institute and perfect all necessary arrangements. 
Finally when his’ sad and greatly to be lamented death occur- 
red, I called a meeting of the Faculty, to assemble on the 9th 
of June. At that meeting it was determined to announce 
through the public press that the Institute wuold be held, and 
Dr. Doak’s plans carried into cxecution as far as practical. 
At the same meeting it was decided not to elect any person 
to fill Dr. Doak’s place on the Faculty as lecturer on Didac- 
tics, as it was believed that a successor to Dr. Doak would 
soon be appointed, who would naturally assume his duties. 
At this meeting, Prof. E. Alexander was clected Treasurer of 
the Faculty, and ordered to receive and disburse the Univer- 
sity fund of $300. appropriated by the Trustees of the Uni- 
versity of Tennessee to meet necessary expenses and contin. 
gencies. 
On the 13th of June I-called the Faculty together again, 
and the following bysiness was transacted: 
Mr. J. W. Jones, Principal of the Knoxville Business Col- 
lege, was elected Lecturer and Instructor in the Art of Pen- 
manship, at a salary of $25.00 for six lessons, to be given du- 
ring the last week of the Institute. The schedule of classes 
and hours was also arranged, and ordered printed for the ase
-P-A-G-E-25
25 
of the students of the Normal Institute, The studies were. 
left blank, so that changes could he indicated as they would 
become necessary. These changes resulted from the fact 
that some of the professors were employed for four weeks, 
some for two, and some for one. 
At this meeting of the Faculty, Rev. Dr. James Park was 
requested to open the Normal Institute with religious exer- 
cises and an address appropriate to the occasion. 
The Institute was opened at 8.30 a. ., on the 21st of June, 
by chapel services, consisting of Bible reading, the singing 
of a hymn, and prayer by Rev. Dr. Park. About forty teach- 
ers were present and enrolled themselves. Besides these the 
chapel was well filled by visitors from the city of Knoxville. 
Dr. Park delivered a most excellent and instructive address 
on the history and mission of normal schools. After the ad- 
dress the several Professors gave a brief outline of the courses 
they would teach; and the school was then graded into the 
“A,” or Elementary Grade, and the “B,” or Advanced Grade, 
the basis of gradation being as follows: In the “A” grade, 
all teachers needing or desiring instruction in the common 
school curriculum, In the “ B” grade, all who had previ- 
ously attended the State Normal Institute, or had studied and 
taught the higher branches of study usually taught in city 
schools. 
After a few remarks from the Principal on the rules of 
order that would be observed, the methods of study and con- 
duct of lessons, the school was dismissed at 11.30, to meet 
for regular work on the next day at 8 o’clock. And the reg- 
ular work was thereafter continued six days in the week for 
four full weeks, in accordance with the schedules and pro- 
gramme. 
The work done can be best shown by the following, which 
is condensed from the reports of the several Professors, tak- 
ing them in the order of their names on the roll of the Fac- 
ulty above given: 
Supt. 5, Y. Caldwell gave six lectures on School Organi- 
zation and Management, embracing the following subjects: 
The Public School Law; The Rights and Duties of-Teach- 
ers; The Grading of City and Country Schools; The Organ- 
izing of a School; Arranging Schedule of daily and yearly 
Work; The Management and Discipline of Schools; The 
Best Method of School-teaching, including Word-method, 
Object-lessons, Oral Teaching, &c. Mr. Caldwell was in

feeble health, and at his request half of his time was given 
to practical instruction in reading, and Mrs. L, C. French, of 
Knoxville, was chosen to perform the duties of instructor. 
Her course consisted of six lessons, treating the following 
subjects: Teaching Reading properly to very young Chil- 
dren; Teaching the more advanced Pupils; then a course of 
instruction in Elocution, under the three heads, Mechanical, 
Technical, and 4@sthetic Culture of the Powers of Speech. 
Prof. W. R. Garrett, of Nashville, gave a course of instruc- 
tion in History and Geography, from July 5th to July zoth, 
inclusive. The course wus especially directed to exemplify 
methods of instruction in Geography, special attention be- 
ing shown to oral methods, map-drawing, topical recitations, 
and the application of object-teaching to Geography, so as to 
invoke the aid of the vivid first impressions derived from the 
sense of sight. A similar course was pursued in reference to 
History, especial emphasis being laid on the geographical 
history of the United States, pointing out how its political, 
statistical and personal history may be clustered around its 
successive geographical developments. 
Prof. James Dinwiddie, of the University of Tennessee, in 
his course of instruction in Mathematics, covered the follow- 
ing ground: The principal rules and operations of Arithme- 
tic, dwelling especially on the fact that Arithmetic is the 
science of the four fundamental operations of Addition, Sub- 
traction, Multiplication and Division, and that the Same prin- 
ciples apply in the performance of these operations on all- 
kinds of numbers, whether integral or fractional, abstract or 
denominate. He also showed that a full understanding of 
the nature of fractions, and skill in handling them, cleared up 
many of the difficulties of Ratio and Proportion, Percentage 
and. Interest. He dwelt on the importance of Analysis in 
Arithmetic, and its advantages over mere rules. He treated 
of the fundamental principles of Algebra, as the- science of 
the Equation, and showed the power and practical utility of 
the signs, and the literal notation, He gave two lectures on 
the Elements of Geometry, and explained the importance of 
its introduction into all schools so as to give correct ideas of 
form and dimensions. He showed how it could be success- 
fully taught to the very young by object lessons and practical 
construction of geometrical figures. 
Prof. E. S. Joynes, of the University of Tennessee, had 
charge of the instruction in English. His course was devoted
-P-A-G-E-27
27 
to the discussion and illustration of the characteristics of the 
English Language with regard to: ist, Its.Grammatical, 
forms; 2d, Its Sentential Structure, and, 3d, Tts Vocabulary 
and Word Forms. 
Prof. 5. H. Lockett, of the University of Tennessee, gave 
a series of experimental lectures on Physics, illustrating fully 
all branches of Natural Philosophy. One of the main objects 
of this course of lectures was to show how nearly all depart- 
ments of Physics can be experimentally illustrated by very 
simple means—means generally within the reach of every 
teacher. ? 
Prof. J. M. McBryde. of the University of Tennessee, 
gave a course of lectures on Agriculture and Botany, the 
Agriculture being in the regular course, as required by State 
law. As auxiliary to these courses, Prof. W. G. Brown. 
of the University, gave a course of experimental lectures in 
Chemistry. Prof. Brown’s lectures were daily during the 
first two weeks, and were attended, with great inteaest, by all 
who could do so. 
Prof. Hunter Nicholson, of the University of Tennessee, 
gave a series of twelve lectures on the general principles of 
Structural and Dynamical Geology, as illustrated in the State 
of Tennessee, using Safford’s Elements of the Geology of 
Tennessee as a basis of instruction. To an optional class of 
nineteen members he delivered a course of twelve lectures on 
human Physiology and Hygiene, and six lectures on the rela- 
tions of Flowers and Insects. Prof. Nicholson commends 
warmly the interest shown by his classes, and recommends 
an extension of his courses in future normal institutes, so as 
to embrace a wider range of Geological study than is required 
by the strict letter of the State law. 
Miss Augusta Tovell, Principal of one of the city schools 
of Memphis, gave a course of twelve lectures, daily, during 
the first two weeks on Primary teaching, illustrating and ex- 
plaining very fully oral methods, object lessons, and the word 
method of teaching reading to the “little ones.® 
She was followed by Miss M, R.S. Hunter, of Chatta- 
nooga, who gave one week's instruction on ‘the use of the 
blackboard in primary instruction. Miss Hunter’s course 
was illustrated by numerous drawings in colored crayon on 
the blackboard, and she showed very skillfully how she used 
these drawings in cultivating all the faculties of children. 
Prof. J. W. Jones, of the Knoxville Business College, aided
-P-A-G-E-28
28 
by his son, followed Miss Hunter, at the same hour, with a 
course of instruction in Practical Penmanship, and lectures 
on how to teach Writing to children, The course, though 
brief, was highly satisfactory. : . 
Two classes of Latin were taught by Prof. E, Alexander, 
of the University of Tennessee. Both were optional. With 
the elementary class, an effort was made to present the de- 
clensions and conjugations, as well as the more common 
points of syntax, in such a way as to enable the student to . 
continue the study of Latin without a teacher. To the more 
advanced students, lectures were delivered on the forms which 
are the most troublesome to learn and to teach, on the uses of 
the cases, tenses and moods, and on scansion. Some time 
was also devoted to an explanation of the Roman method of 
pronouncing Latin. 
Professor Alexander was also engaged as Secretary, Treas- 
urer, and General Manager of the business of the Institute, 
which very completely occupied his time. The efficient. 
" courteous and thorough manner in which he performed his 
multifarious duties deserve especial mention. 
In all there were 183 enrolled attendants, besides a large 
number of occasional visitors. Of these, 120 were teachers 
of public schools, 9 of private schools, 32 were young per- 
sons, graduates of city schools, preparing to be teachers, 2 
county superintendents, 2 city superintendents, 5 principals 
of academies. 3 professors of colleges, and the rest persons 
interested in educational work. Eleven stood examination in 
the Advanced “B” Grade, six of whom made an average 
over 80, and were recommended for rst class certificates; two 
made average above 65, and were recommended for 2d class 
certificates; and three fell below the required average. There 
were 25 candidates for certificates in the Elementary “A” 
Grade. Eleven averaged above 80; eight, above 65; and six. 
fell below grade. Of those who did not stand examination, 
the majority already had certificates from county and city 
superintendents for the coming year, and felt no necessity for 
further labor, and preferred to save the expense which would 
be incurred by remaining in Knoxville during the three days 
of examination. All sections of Tennessee were represented, 
and the adjoining State’ of Kentucky, Virginia, Georgia and 
Alabama each sent one or more delegates. 
Trusting that this report is sufficiently in detail, and not too 
long, and that it will show you that we who have been en-

trusted with the good work, have at least done it with zeal 
and fidelity, and thanking you for your marks of confidence 
and approval already shown to myself, I have the honor to be, 
Your obedient servant,

NORMAL INSTITUTES 
FOR - 
COLORED TEACHERS. 
Two Normal Institutes were held for colored teachers, one 
at LeMoyne Institute, Memphis, under the efficient manage- 
ment of Prof. A. J. Steele, whose excellent report. is here given. 
I doubt whether more work was ever done so well on so 
small amount of money. Only. $200.00 were appropriated 
by the Peabody Fund to this Institute. The other Institute 
was held in the Austin Building at Knoxville, under the skill- 
ful and energetic management of Rev. W. H. Franklin. 
This Institute received $100.00 from the Peabody Fund. 
The County Superintendents, W. L. Henderson, of Shelby, 
and W. C. Gibbs, of Knox, deserve our thanks for their zeal 
and ‘courage in doing everything they could to secure the 
comfort and success of these Institutes.

Rev. B. A. Imes, as instructor in Reading and Elocution, and 
by Miss E. A. Hamilton, who gave instruction in Cee P TN 
and United States History. 8 \ we | re V y ‘ 
  The topical method was adopted in all the- 28 vétion § giv- 
en, the topics being posted at least a day iy ‘advance, and 
taken down for study by the teachers atten ling. 7 gives me 
pleasure here to state that the teachers in attendarce did 
carefully note and study these topics. and that many of then 
showed surprising proficiency and readiness» Instruction in 
the way of questions and axswers and demonstration and 
explanation. was given to the entire institute in each topic, at. 
the same time, with use of blackboard, charts, globe Uda |

PROF. FRANKLIN’S REPORT. 
_ Kyoxvitte, Tenn,, 
July 31st, 1882. 
Rev. G.S. W. Crawrorp, State Superintendent, Nashville, 
Tenn: | : 
ar Sir: Our Normal Institute began here on the 3rd 
with (17) seventeen teachers,, and closed last Friday 
ng with (44) forty-four enrolled. The illness and death 
r late State Superintendent, Dr. Doak, made it impos- . 
to obtain any information concerning the matter. But 
ear before had made such a favorable impression upon 
5 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
34 
the minds of the teachers, that they had determined to have 
a normal institute of some kind. 
It was, therefore, not known what would be its nature or 
the source of its support, until it had been going on some 
time. But you, having become the successor of the late 
honored and -Jamented Dr. Doak, and being appealed to, 
acted promptly and faithfnlly in the matter, and secured us 
sufficient means from the Peabody Fund to pay the required 
expenses of the institute. 
For this kind consideration we feel very grateful to you 
and to Dr. Curry, agent of the Peabody Fund. 
The following is a general report’ of the State Normal 
Institute, at Austiri School Building, Knoxville, Tenn.:

McFarland and a response by Dr. Smith, president of the 
association. 
The meeting was largely attended. Representatives were 
there from all parts of the State. .A deep and lively interest

NASHVILLE CITY SCHOOLS. 
NasuviL_z, December 15th, 1882. 
Hon. G. S. W. Crawrorp, State Superintendent Public 
Instruction: 
Dear Sir: In compliance with your courteous request, I 
submit the following condensed report of the ‘operation of 
the public schools of this city for the past session: 
Tn all the essential elements that enter into a well organized 
and administered system, the year’s record has been as bright 
as that of any one of the twenty-seven preceding it 
in the history of the schools. With an increase in the 
enrollment and the per cent. of attendance and a diminution 
in the number tardy and in punishments, the average scholar- 
ship has been up to the usual standard, Financially the 
schools are in much better condition than they have ever 
been before? The teachers received their salaries promptly 
at the end of each month, and the year closed with all ex- 
penses met and a balance in the treasury. 
The substitution of quarterly for monthly intervals in the 
system of keeping records and reports, and in holding 
examinations, has been tested for this the second year with 
the most gratifying results. Much léss tedious clerical work 
is required of teachers and more than half of the former’ 
worry and nervous tension on the part of the pupils is thus 
saved, while there is less cramming and -higher real learning 
secured, 
. The rules for the examination of both pupils and teachers 
have been revised and improved, and we confidently hope 
that they will in the near future bring us improv ed classes 
and more efficient instructors.

Hon. G. S. W. Crawrorp, State Superintendent Public 
Instruction: 
Dear Sir: Vhave the honor to present herewith a report 
of the Chattanooga public schools for the year ending July 
3ist, 1882. A class of fourteen completed the High School 
course, and the graduating exercises were held in James’ 
Hall. I-quote a few lines from the city press in regard -to 
their success:
-P-A-G-E-38
38 
“The graduating exercises of the High School at James’ 
Hail yesterday are without a parallel in her history. The 
idea of making a public exhibition in a hall was conceived 
but a few weeks ago, but the magnificent success of yester- 
day gives assurance of its permanence. Shortly after 1 
p. m., the crowd began surging to the Hall, and long before 
the exercises commenced it was jammed from pit to dome 
with the largest audience ever before assembled in this city. 
Every available spot was taken up, and large crowds filled 
the stairways.” 
The closing exercises of the Primary and Grammar schools 
were held at the several school buildings in the morning, and 
1 again quote from the city press: 
“Yesterday was a triumphant day for our public schools, 
and never before in our history have they appeared at such 
an advantage. Our public schools are our pride, and well 
they might be. They are growing in public favor every 
year, and the immense crowd that thronged all the buildings 
bear positive proof of their increased popularity. Our 
citizens are recognizing more and more every year their 
magnificent success and their unpar: alleled adv: ancement, and 
esteem and value them correspondingly. We have never, 
witnessed a more perfect, smooth and interesting close of any 
system of schools than was afforded us, and there is positive 
_ evidence of thorough discipline and excellent management.”

EXTRACT FROM THE REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT, E. J. 
SANFORD. 
“From the report of our Secretary and Treasurer, E. E. 
McCroskey, which is herewith submitted, you can ascertain 
what amount of, money has come into our hands, and in brief 
for what purposes we have expended it. This sum, 
$16,086.20, may seem to you at first a very large amount of 
money for us to spend, but when you consider-that two thou- 
sand one hundred and thirty-seven young children were given 
the privilege of securing for themselves the education and 
training necessary to best fit them for lives of usefulness and 
honor, and when you further consider, that were it not for 
this liberality on your part in sustaining the city schools, that 
many—very many—of these two thousand one hundred and 
thirty-seven children would undoubtedly have been allowed 
to grow up in ignorance and all of its accompanying evils, 
we believe, that then neither you nor the tax-payers whom 
you represent will regret your action in the matter, inasmuch 
as our reports will clearly show, that with a less sum the 
work could not have been accomplished. With our growing 
city, our enrollment is constantly increasing, and in conse- 
quence additional teachers are necessary, causing increased 
expenditures in the aggregate, While this is true your Board 
have been able to decrease the expense per scholar enrolled, 
and at the same time to keep the schools up to the high 
standard—our expense now being only $7.55 per year for 
each pupil enrolled. This sum is the least amount paid by any 
city whose schools are maintained at public expense, so faras 
Thave been able to learn. The catalogues of most of the
-P-A-G-E-45
45 
public schools in cities like ours show the expense for each 
scholar enrolled to be nearly twice the amount paid by us. 
“Our Superintendent, Prof. Albert Ruth, has made a very © 
interesting, exhaustive and detailed report of the operations 
of the schools for the last year, which shows that your 
schools have been kept up to a commendable degree of 
excellence, and promise even greater results in the future.”
-P-A-G-E-46
REPORTS OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS, 
BEDFORD. 
I herewith submit my annual report, in which I am glad to 
note the general good condition of our schools. There is a 
marked increase in enrollment and average attendance; also 
an increase of more than one month in the length of term. 
There is a growing disposition among the people to put our 
best men in the directorship. Directors are conducting the 
schools more judiciously and systematically. 
PROFESSIONAL TEACHERS, 
These are in demand. Many calls have been made at this 
office for teachers of experience, energy and professional 
ability. Such teachers command a fair salary, Looking to 
the improvement of the profession, our directors in annual 
convention assembled, instructed the County Superintendent, 
by resolution, to raise the standard of qualification in his 
examination of applicants for certificates. This has been 
done, and though the effect will not of course be immediate, 
yet such a course will finally result in good. 
TEACHERS’ LIBRARY. 
We have a teachers’ circulating library, composed of 
works on pedagogics, which is doing much good.’ The 
school directors of the county, at their annual meeting, voted 
an appropriation of one cent per capita of the scholastic 
population, equal in amount to nearly ninety dollars, for the 
library, and passed a resolution that-after a reasonable time 
no teacher should be emplo¥ed who refused to study and 
pass an examination in pedagogics. 
INSTITUTES. 
One institute each month has been held during the term. 
These were held on Saturdays, the sessions continuing only 
one day. The programme included papers and lectures by
-P-A-G-E-47
{ 
| 
| 47 
our’ best teachers. and a general discussion of the same; 
classes/from various schools exhibited and the best methods 
of ‘class management and recitation shown; the formation of: 
institute into a normal class, conducted by some of our 
“experts” in pedagogics. . 
These institutes, though limited, have been greatly bene- 
ficial. 
VISITATION, 
During the present term I have seen nearly all our schools 
at work. In my visits, I note the general condition of the 
school, the methods of class management and recitation, the 
character of the work, and the means and character of gov- 
ernment. These I grade on a scale of 100, and publish the 
same in our county papers, giving each teacher’s name with 
the corresponding grade of his school. I think these pub- 
lished reports have done much good in inciting a generous 
rivalry among our schools. 
HOUSES, FURNITURE AND APPARATUS. 
Tam glad to report continued progress during the year in the 
improvement of houses and furniture. Two substantial and 
well arranged houses have been erected during the year; two 
more are building, and others undergoing repair. Patent 
folding desks are also being introduced gradually. The 
water and fuel supply is greatly improved. There is, how- 
ever, great lack of apparatus. But few schools are supplied 
with outline maps or globes. cube-root blocks, or numeral 
frames. We have no kindergarten gifts, neither chemical nor 
philosophical apparatus. It is true, that neither chemistry 
nor philosophy is included in our curriculum. yet I am sure 
that a practical demonstration of the most popular lessons 
in these sciences will add greatly to the general interest of 
the schools. , 
  CONSOLIDATION AND HIGH SCHOO. 
  One of the greatest objects of my work has been to lessen 
the number of our schools by consolidation, and thus in a 
union of forces increase their efficiency by making them 
stronger and more permanent. 
My object has been to secure one or two first-class high 
schools in each district, which of course necessarily requires 
the consolidation of the weaker schools. In my last report I
-P-A-G-E-48
48 
made mention of such work, and I am glad to repor{ now an 
increased interest and energy in this regard. Asan ilnstance, 
. I might mention the formation of a new school district from 
the corners of three other districts, thus including about 180 
pupils.: They have built them a splendid house and have 
now in progress a first-class high school with an enrollment 
of 140. 
FINANCES. 
We are certainly in good financial condition, as you will see 
by statistical table, which shows a balance on hand of 
$10,000.00. We hope to be able to get an additional tax levy 
next April, sufficient to give us an average term of seven 
months. 
SUGGESTIONS, 
We think that in the management of our schools entirely 
‘too much is left to the discretion of school directors. Under 
our present law they are almost autocrats. Their actions are 
frequently greatly prejudiced, and their errors can often 
be corrected only by formal, slow and expensive law suits. 
They tear down and build houses at will, where such should 
not be done, and obstinately refuse to do such work where it 
is positively needed; they employ low grade teachers for 
high grade schools in the face of the patron’s protest; where 
the people of a community desire to form a new school dis- 
trict or a consolidated high school, they sometimes check the 
move by refusing to co-operate; they refuse to transfer pupils 
where it is a matter of both justice and convenience to the 
patron, or transfer children from the door of one school to 
another perhaps three times as far, almost wholly upon 
prejudice and animosity. I suggest simply that their power 
should be restricted in many particulars. 
I suggest that the standard of our certificates should be 
raised, so that no teacher who in examination falls below 5 
on any study, especially Orthography, Reading, English 
Grammar or Arithmetic, shall be granted a certificate. In- 
stances are known’ where teachers have obtained a good 
general average, but who are really incompetent to take 
charge of a school from lack of sufficient knowledge of one 
or more of the above named studies. 
I suggest further, that the law should be so amended as to 
prescribe the manner of electing directors in new districts
-P-A-G-E-49
49 
formed on county lines, or in sub-districts newly formed. 
Lack of this prescription has given us some trouble in this 
county. 
. JAMES L. HUTSON, 
Superintendent. 
  
BENTON. 
This report is accurate concerning thirteen of the: schools 
in this county. I have been unable to get a complete report 
from several of our schools as to what was collected by the 
Trustee of the county. As he left the county about the rst 
of September last, and has not been heard from since, and 
as his financial matters are such that no man can tell what 
he collected and what he paid out, I am wholly unable to 
give a satisfactory report. 
A. J. FARMER. 
  
BLOUNT. ‘ 
In compliance with law, I have the honor of submitting to 
you my second annual report of the public schols of this 
county, which covers the school year ending June 30, 1882, 
A survey of the educational statistics for the past year 
shows that improvements have been secured in more than 
one feature: yet, the frequent change of teachers, lack of 
uniformity of text-books, irregularity of attendance, lack of 
interest on the part of school officers and patrons in some 
localities, are difiicuities that can only be gradually over- 
come. 
YT have made special effort during the past year to secure 
uniformity of text-books, black-boards, better seating, warm- 
ing, and the ventilating of school rooms, and I find it a work 
of no small magnitude. T have been met with objection, 
and lack of interest on. the part of some, but in quite a 
large number of instances the object sought has been 
accomplished. 
Thave been unable to make the standard of qualification 
for teachers what in my judgment it should be, owing to the 
difficulty of obtaining teachers for the schools. There has 
been some demand for good teachers, especially males, two 
  a
-P-A-G-E-50
50 
things, however, incompatible in themselves, are inseparably 
connected, viz: a good teacher who is cheap, the result too 
frequently is a poor teacher who is dear, 
Among the.sadly neglected studies of the common school 
curriculum, | have laid special stress upon writing and lan- 
guage lessons. The former is now almost universal in our 
schools, while the latter is receiving much closer attention. 
While yet in a few back-woods districts, “any one will 
do,” throughout the country generally there has been a 
stronger demand for better teachers. Having tested the 
benefits accruing to them from the good teacher’s work, dis- 
tricts insist on fuller gratification of this feeling. Aside from 
any vanity, I hope I have been somewhat instrumental in 
securing this result. Having reduced the number of teachers 
toa minimum by lopping off the outgrown and worthless 
branches, and refusing to license young aspirants who had 
better be taught than teach, I was able to locate many of the 
remainder where they could do the most efficient work. 
Some of those who reluctantly bade teaching a long farewell, 
and some who were not permitted to bid it good morning, 
are undoubtedly better employed in other vocations, but the 
greater number of the second class are persistently fitting 
themselves for teaching. They will soon be needed, and 
when the time comes, will be prepared to assume under- 
standingly the duties of teachers. 
This is encouraging, and, from the present outlook, the 
advance will be strongly marked during the year. 
In conclusion, permit me to state that during the two years 
of my incumbency, I bave labored honestly for the welfare 
of the schools, making such changes as I deemed advisable, 
and introducing such features as best conform to present 
thought. While the improvement of the mind is not con- 
fined to any channel or line of thought, it is no easy matter 
to convince the majority of the people of this fact. 
The modern improvements in machinery and practical arts 
possess substance and appeal to the lowest and least culti- 
vated, but that there should be any improvement in methods 
or quality of teaching is accepted with many reservations, 
even by people of intelligence. 
This reserve must be driven from its untenable covert 
before the field is safely won to the advanced advocates of 
reason and science, .
-P-A-G-E-51

Ihave only to say that my two years’ experience in ‘the 
superintendency of schools of. Blount County has been 
exciting and in a great measure pleasant, though burdened 
with labor and disagreeable work. The latter was necessary 
to get things in proper shape, and if I have paid the political 
forfeit of too severe administration, I do not regret that I have 
been. impartial and thorough. What errors I have made 
have been made through zeal for the welfare of the schools 
and the ever present desire to do. what was right, and a 
greater reward to me than continuance in office would be to 
hear it said in after time that “he did his duty.” 
* Respectfully, | * : 
G. C. JACKSON. 
  
BRADLEY. 
Our schools are moving along in their regular routine of 
work. Many of them are more prosperous than usual, 
while the interest of a few is at a lowebb. It is a fact 
worthy of mention that during this year a greater number of 
first grade certificates have been issued than previously. This 
‘is attributable to an increase in the salaries of teachers. Our 
' directors are opening their eyes to reason and common sense 
and are acting upon the principle that good teachers must 
have better wages than poor teachers, and as a natural con- 
sequence many experienced teachers who have been driven 
from the profession by starvation salaries have returned to 
their old vocation. We may reasonably expect an impetus 
“to the educational progress of our county.. Our directors 
are generally negligent in making their reports to me, many 
having failed to report at all, consequently my report is 
incomplete. 
Ihave made it as nearly correet as possible. Our school 
law is too lenient—not enough of compulsion in it. We 
have regular teachers’ meetings on alternate Saturdays. 
Our teachers manifest much interest in them. When all 
our schools are able to employ teachers with stamina— 
teachers of strong resolution, of fixed purpose, of generous 
culture, then ignorance will hunt a hiding place’in more 
congenial climes. I feel confident that the future of our 
schools is not only full of glowing hopes, but is laden with. 
pleasing realities. Let one and all join hands in this noble 
work and push on to the goal.

The great trouble in this county is the want of better 
teachers. Give us more money and we can soon get better 
teachers. Good teachers and good salaries are generally 
together. 1 think our County Court will levy a tax sufficient 
to run our schools longer and to pay our teachers better 
Give-us more money!

_ We are making some progress in the work of public 
schools. The dissatisfaction of previous years has nearly 
“passed away, and the people are icarning the value of free 
schools. We had a decidedly better corps of school teachers 
last year than usual, and consequently our schools were 
better. We need good summer institutes, designed especially 
for training our teachers in the. science of school manage- 
ment and discipline. There is also great need of instruction 
in the elementary branches of a good English education.

The schools of my county are in a very promising condi- 
tion. There has been no material change in school property 
since last'year. The value stands as last year. T am unable 
to furnish you with the receipts and disbursements of revenue . 
from the fact that the the trustee of my county has failed to 
make a return of the same to me. I furnished him with the 
blanks for that purpose and ordered him to make return, as 
the law directs, but have not received it. Should I receive it 
in a short time, I will forward it and ask you to file it with 
my annual report. 
You will see that the attendance in schools is better in 
this county than it was last year.

_ Our schools are ina more prosperous condition than ever 
before. This is clearly shown by ozr increased enrollment 
and average daily attendance. Public sentiment is still 
growing in favor of free schools. Great improvements have 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  53 
been made in the method of teaching. District directors 
exercise more care in employing teachers, always giving 
preference to those who expect to make teaching their pro- 
fession. We have four normal schools, taught by wide- 
awake, energetic teachers. 
E. M. WHITWORTH. 
CUMBERLAND. 
Our schools are in a flourishing condition. We have 
thirty-one schools in the ‘county. T have visited most of them, 
and find them working well. There is considerable gain in 
attendance over any previous year. The percentage of enroll- 
ment is on the increase. There seems to be more interest 
among the patrons than heretofore. I think our next Legis- 
lature ought to give the County Courts the right to levy 
sufficient tax for at least five months school each year, which 
cannot be done in our county on account of low valuation. 
Our teachers are of a good grade. 
Wm. A. HAMBY. 
DAVIDSON. 
It affords me much pleasure to note the increased interest 
in school circles for the vast year. The enrollment, daily 
attendance, &c., show that our patrons, directors, teachers, 
and all have been at work. Our enroliment has increased 
over 1,500, and the daily attendance in like proportion. It is 
impossible for a County Superintendent to give the exact 
statistics of the teachers work. It is true, many of our 
teachers are ladics and gentlemen of high rank and are 
devoting their whole time to their schools and at the close of 
the term are ready to render a strict account of their stew- 
ardship—hence they hand in their reports. Others, from a 
careless indifference, neglect or reftise to make a report— 
therefore we have no means of ascertaining the facts, save 
by reference to our day-bock and notes taken while visiting 
the schools. It was surely a misfortune to public schools 
that the last Legislature repealed the only law that would 
compel an indifferent teacher to perform his duty. There 
are many changes in the school law that might be urged on 
our next Legislature which, if enacted, would greatly advance 
he cause of education.

There is every reason to believe our county and city 
schools are gaining favor. Many of our citizens who have 
heretofore spurned with contempt our public schools are” 
to-day not only assisting by their patronage, but also by their 
influence. I am fully persuaded that much prejudice has 
been removed by the flourishing condition of our finances. 
Our districts being free from debt, the directors of the 
majority of the districts employ only teachers of professional 
merit, pay them at the end of each month, and therefore 
receive good work. Some of our directors still think that a 
low-grade teacher at a very small salary is economizing the 
school fund, but their eyes are opened gradually. 
The schools of our county, both public and private, did a 
* vast amount of work the past vear. There.seems to be a 
fellow-feeling existing between-the two that endears them to 
the hearts of all our people. Teachers’* meetings are held 
monthly, and [ feel sure, from the amount of interest mani- 
fested, that great good will be accomplished by the inter- 
change of ideas. 
With a heart full of gratitude we return thanks for the 
advice, counsel and encouraging influences that were tendered 
us by friends that are dear—some of whom are now reaping 
a rich harvest from their labors—among whom we would not 
have the teachers, parents, pupils and friends forget the 
words of wisdom and admonition “to work,” by.our friend 
and brother, the late lamented State Superintendent W. S. 
Doak, D. D. May. his words of encouragement find refuge 
in onr hearts. May his bright precepts and example be 
engraved upon the tablets of our hearts as souvenirs and 
monitors—and when our work is ended may we, like him, 
fall with our faces towards the ‘‘golden shore,” where we 
may be safely anchored in the great School House above. 
We hope to achieve more in the future than in the past.

DECATUR. 
Thave not visited many schools this year, believing as ‘I 
did that I could accomplish as much or more good by hold- 
ing institutes and having public addresses made upon educa-
-P-A-G-E-55
55 
tional subjects, and conferring with the teachers collectively 
and publicly. The public school system is slowly but surely 
‘growing in favor with public sentiment in this county. I 
heartily concur in the opinion that a revision of the school 
law is highly necessary to the efficient working of the system 
in Tennessee. , ‘ ’ 
The people of this county, so far as I have heard an.- 
expression, favor the re-enacting of the approving authority’ 
of County Superintendents. 
Our county is a small one, as shown by the population. 
_ My report shows forty-four school districts, which I think 
are entirely too many. Much money and labor has been 
almost wasted in little schools of short duration, in which 
there is at best but little life or interest manifested, and much 
Jess order or system observed. 
In order to have better schools of longer terms, and 
especially better houses, it is necessary to have larger districts, 
a wider range of interest, and more means. 
W. H. H. McMILLAN, M.D. 
    
DEKALB. 
I will say in addition to my statistical report, that the 
puhlic schools of DeKalb County are in a better condition 
than they have been in since the establishment of the public 
school system in Tennessee. Ihave, by rigid economy and 
prudent expenditure of the school fund, been able to have 
almost five months’ schools all over the county, which has 
never been sv before. I hope to be able to get the County 
Court, next year, to levy a larger tax, and have at least five 
months’ school. : 
The people generally are becoming more interested in 
schools, and will more willingly and readily pay a larger tax 
to support them. There are, in my judgment, some defects 
in the school law which I think the Legislature should cure 
by amendment or otherwise. ist. The Legislature, at its 
regular session in 1881, repealed that part of the law which 
required school warrants to be audited by the County Super- 
intendent before they were paid off by the trustee; by that 
means the County Superintendent had it in his power to 
cohtrol and prevent any illegal issuance of warrants. As it 
is now, district directors have it in their power to issue war-
-P-A-G-E-56
56 
rants for any purpose they may see proper, be it right or 
wrong. It may sometimes happen that directors are elected 
who have no financial ability, or know nothing about 
economy, and care nothing about economy, and care nothing 
about the success of their schools, and will profligately 
expend the school money, and bankrupt the school, and 
bring about confusion and disaster generally. Still there is 
no remedy for it. If a school warrant is signed by two 
directois and directed to the trustee, no one has any right to 
inquire into it. I have never yet been able to learn any 
reason whatever for doing away with that authority, which 1 
think should have remained in the superintendent. IT have 
asked members of that Legislature why that part of the law 
was repealed, and have never yet met one who knew any- 
thing about it. If there is one in the State who can give any 
reason for their action iu that matter, I hope he will do the 
public the kindness to give it. If you should concur with 
me in this, I hope you will use your influence with the Legis- 
lature, when it convenes again, to get them to re-enact that 
clause repealed. It is of vast importance, in my judgment.

DICKSON. 
The schools are in a very prosperous condition; will run 
four months all over the connty. We pay the teachers at 
the expiration of each month. The public schools are 
growing more popular, and many of our best citizens and 
largest tax-payers are desirous of increasing the taxes 
sufficient to extend them to five months. 
W. G. McMILLAN. 
  
DYER. 
T herewith submit to you my report for the scholastic year 
ending June 30, 1882: Am glad to say that the public 
school interest is still on the increase in every particular. As 
to public favor, there is just about enough opposition to 
inspire the friends of the institution with the necessary zael 
and activity. 
We have never had an election in this county. If our | County Court were to permit one, T have no doubt as regards
-P-A-G-E-57
if 57 
favorable results. As it is, nearly enough tax is levied to run 
our schools as long as patrons.can spare their children from 
the farm. . 
Our tax on property is only 15 cents on the hundred dollars, 
still this. is quite equal to 20 or 25 cents in many other counties 
by reason of the high price of lands. Our houses are, in the 
main, good and are well supplied with desks, black-boards, 
&c. Our teachers are more efficient now than ever before. 
My examinations this year have been written and rigid, and 
I have been gratified with a large number, who have 
obtained first-class certificates. Our institutes are on the: 
normal plan. This contributes more than anything else to 
the efficiency of our teachers. I would call attention to the 
‘fact that unless that part of the law giving to directors sole 
power to form new districts is repealed, many counties will 
have their school interest much impaired by the recklessness 
of directors. Also that in many instances teachers never 
make out their abstracts, because not compelled to do so. 
‘Your reports will, necessarily, be imperfect until a change is 
made. Many teachers do not live in the county, and as soon 
as their session closes they get their money and are heard of 
no more by us. By reason of this imperfection my repért is 
not strietly correct, but is the best I can do. 
A. J. HALL. 
  
FAYETTE. 
Tn accordance with instructions received from the late 
State Superintendent, I held a public examination of teachers 
during the last week in June, but as only a small fraction of 
the teachers in the county attended, was forced to hold a 
second examination during the first week in August. In con- 
ys Sequence of this extra examination, I was’so much delayed 
/ in visiting the schools that, to my mortification, some had 
closed the second months’ term before I reached them. Most 
of them were, however, visited, and considerable improve- 
ment noted, which the enrollment in the different studies, as 
compared with that of 1881, will show. Many of these 
schools are strictly primary, having no pupils beyond the 
tudiments, and I would beg leave to suggest that hereafter 
two examinations should be held yearly, one granting primary 
certificates and the other first and second grades, leaving out 
entirely. the third grade and special certificates, :

-P-A-G-E-58
53 
At the examination in August, which was well attended, a 
teachers’ association was organized, the first meeting to be 
held at Centre Point Academy, on the first Friday in Novem- 
ber, and I hope to be able to report favorably of its effects. 
I have again been delayed in making this report by failure in 
receiving directors’ reports and teachers’ abstracts. Since 
the County Superintendent does not sign the orders for pay- 
ment of teachers, there is great neglect in handing in the 
abstracts. 
I have constant applications for “copies of the school 
law” and earnestly beg that the State Superintendent will 
send a supply of them to this office as soon as possible. 
NORA CANNON. 
  
FENTRESS. 
I send you my report to-day. I have done the best I could. 
The County Trustee has not yet collected the county school 
tax, and he does not know what will be the amount. He 
says he has received $204.16 from the State, and has. paid 
none out. TI have given orders or warrants to him through 
teachers and district clerks, but he has paid none of them 
yet. The county school tax for each scholar will be about 
$1.00 for this year. When the district clerks are paid there 
will be left about go cents per scholar. 
T have only been County Superintendent one month, but I 
will give you a nicer report next time, if Tam in office then.

FRANKLIN. 
This report approximates correctness as near as possible to 
make it. Its important features are correct. I mention a 
few things as suggestive, which greatly, I think, prevent that 
success which might be attained if removed. ist. The want 
of suitable school buildings. Many of the public schools are 
taught in church buildings, without any of the conveniencies 
which are necessary—viz: the absence of desks and other 
school fixtures, and even many of the school buildings are 
very deficient in this respect, and but very poorly adapted to 
school purposes; another difficulty is the want of uniformity 
in school books. This we hope to remedy in the future by
-P-A-G-E-59
+59 
the adoption of books for a period of at least five years. 
Another very serious obstacle is the irregular attendance. 
This seems to he. under the state of affairs, a necessity, The 
boys are compelled to labor on the farm. The schools have 
generally been conducted through the summer and fall, when 
their help is greatl+ needed—bence the statistics show but a 
very small attendance of students, especially boys from 12 to 
18 and.18 to 21-——whereas, if the school buildings were made 
comfortable and the schools conducted through the winter, 
the attendance would he much larger, especially of that class 
who need it worst.   
The schools of my county, with all the drawbacks, have 
made considerable progress during the past year, and I am 
glad to say that the people seem to be awake to some extent 
in trying to remove these difficulties. ‘There is a disposition 
to put most of our school houses in good order. .There has 
been more done in this direction last year than in four years 
past. Several large. comfortable and convenient school 
buildings have been erected and quite a number repaired and 
furnished with necessary helps, so that the general outlook is 
hopeful. Our people feel a just pride in our educational out- 
look. ~ 
W. B. WATTERSON. 
GIBSON. 
T herewith submit my annual written report of the schools 
of Gibson County for the year ending June 30, 1882, and in 
so doing J have to beg pardon for the delay and offer as’ an 
excuse, and the only excuse, a defect in the school law, which 
T hope you will bring to the attention of the next General 
Assembly. The defect to which I refer is the fact that 
school orders do not have to be approved by County Super- 
intendents, thus giving them no power to collect the abstracts 
so needful for the making of a correct report. Determined 
to make a correct report or none, I found, when I began to 
make my report, many abstracts were wanting and I have 
had a great deal of trouble and traveled hundreds of miles 
getting them up. This, and this only, is my defense for my 
delay. . 
Thave a faithful and prompt Board of Directors, and I 
take pleasure in making special mention of the prompt and
-P-A-G-E-60
60 
efficient manner in which the clerks have discharged their 
duties, but in a county like Gibson, where so many teachers 
are employed, a large number of whom live out of the county 
and come and go, it is almost a matter of impossibility to get 
abstracts of all the schools, unless the Superintendet has the 
power to compel them by having their orders pass under his 
signature. 
I call your attention to the statistics, which in almost every 
department show a healthy growth of the school interest in 
this county, and I am confident that in general interest and 
prosperity Gibson is not behind a single county’ in the State. 
A. deep interest is manifested and the peédlic schools are 
decidedly in favor now; in fact there are no other kind. 
The growth and prosperity of the schools are largely due to 
the liberal feeling manifested by the County Court, the mem- 
bers of which, laying aside any personal views, have looked 
to the common good, and given the schools liberal support, 
and the Superintendent that fails to cultivate a healthy senti- 
ment in the court, fails in his duty to the schools, and I take 
great pleasure also in stating that the court has never failed 
to respond when I have made an appeal to it. The tax has 
been raised to 25 cents, and I feel assured that in January it 
will be raised to 30 cents. : 
TEACHERS. 
This is my third report, and I have noted carefully during 
the time I have held the office the development of the teach- 
ing talent of the county, and the growth of the class of good 
teachers has been marked. We encourage the employment 
of home teachers, but we bring to bear upon them all availa- 
ble means to stimulate them and encourage them to become 
proficient, and to-day we have a splendid artay of first-class 
teaching talent in this county. 
DISTRICT TEACHERS’ MEETINGS AND NORMAL INSTITUTES. 
As a means of arousing interest on the part of both people 
and teachers, I have found the district teachers’ meeting 
invaluable, and at all proper times I have held these meetings 
in the districts, and as a means of advancing the teachers 
themselves, I have found the summer normal all sufficient. 
I called a meeting of the Board of Directors in May, and 
brought before them the need of a summer normal. They 
instructed me to hold two—one for the white and one for the
-P-A-G-E-61
61 
colored teachers—and run them four weeks, and. pay the 
expenses out of the school fund. I did so. I secured five 
first-class instructors, who gave their time, only charging the 
actual expense incurred. - The normal was a grand success. 
One hundred and four teachers attended the white normal 
and forty-seven the colored, and the good effects are seen and 
felt already and the end is not yet, and I can recommend to 
any county that wants a healthy public school system to have 
a live summer normal. In this connection T must say that the 
county is under many and lasting obligations to Profs. G. R. 
McGee, J. W. Conger, A. W. Roberts, P. H. Manning and 
S. E. Grace, the instructors, and Prof. Claude J. Bell, the 
efficient secretary. : 
SCHOOL HOUSES, 
The report shows quite a number of new houses erected 
during the year. In the past three years we have built many 
neat and attractive school houses and in every district and at 
almost every place we have splendid well furnished houses, a 
thing that attracts the attention of travelers and others seek- 
ing homes, and-to our good schools and well organized 
system Gibson County owes her growth. ~ 
TEXT-BOOKS. 
This troublesome question has at last been practically set- 
tled in this ‘county. We have adopted a uniform series ot 
books for five years, and already in most of the schools the 
text-book question is at rest. We had quite a decided oppo- 
sition, but all seem satisfied, and the good effects are being 
felt: 
SCHOOL VISITATIONS., 
\ 
One of the dutics of the Superintendent, and one I deem 
quite important, is to visit the schools, and TL have made it a 
point to comply strictly with this requirement, and I see on 
every hand the good effect, No Superintendent is worthy 
the place that does not visit the schools, note their condition, 
acquaint himself with their excellencies and apply his ener- 
gies to correct the former and encourage the latter. 
There are many other things to which I would like to call 
your attention, ‘but for fear I appear in the light of an 
enthusiast, I will close this report by saying that we are alive
-P-A-G-E-62
62 
to the great interest under consideration, with a hearty 
determination to constantly improve and make the public 
schools of Gibson County equal to any in the land. 
JAS. R. DEASON. 
GILES. 
I submit to you my second annual report of the public 
schools of Giles Counnty. Had the law requiring County 
Superintendents to audit and approve all schoo! warrants not’ 
been repealed, so that every teacher would be compelled to _ 
return his abstract properly filled, I could have made a better 
showing, in some respects at least. Notwithstanding the 
severe drouth of last year our Honorable County Court 
levied a tax of 10 centson property and to cents on privileges, 
which, with the one dollar on polls and the interest on the 
State fund, has enabled us to run our schools about five 
months. The attendance has been very good, and I notice, 
with feelings of gratulation, that the directors, appreciating 
the value of first-class teachers, are paying more liberal 
salaries than heretofore, and consequently getting better work 
in the school-room. 
During my first year I was severely censured by many 
people for being strict in my examinations of applicants, and 
rejecting many who had heretofore held certificates. The 
result has shown that I was right. Those young ladies and 
gentlemen whom I rejected were forced to enter our high 
schools and colleges and qualify themselves to teach or leave 
the profession. Having wisely chosen the former, they 
returned this year and passed the ordeal with credit to them- 
selves and pride to their friends, and in almost every instance, 
succeeded in getting good schools, and sustained themselves 
admirably. I believe if the course of study now required by 
law were extended, so as to include some of the sciences 
with Algebra and Latin, and a competent corps of teachers 
to teach them, our public schools would beeome so popular 
that our people would gladly pay a tax sufficient to run them 
ten months each year, and thus place it in the power ot 
every child in the State to obtain a good education, at one- 
fourth the cost he can at any private school. °

GRAINGER, 
Our public schools opened about the first of August with a 
very good corps of teachers. Though some of them are 
inexperienced, yet they are doing a manful work. 
I canvassed my county in the month of March in the inter- 
est of my schools in regard to the financial condition of the 
school district. After taking a survey of what they had paid 
out for teachers’ salaries and other expenses, I find that we 
have a large amount of money coming to us from the 
Trustee and we are not in debt. Our worthy Trustee has 
paid out every dollar that has been called for. 
We will be able to run ovr schools for five or six months. 
What can be done with directors who are slow to send in 
their reports? 
ISAAC W. DANIEL. 
GREENE, 
We held our fifth annual Normal School with an attend- 
ance of ninety-four teachers in the white and nineteen 
teachers in the colored. These institutes are now esteemed 
as a feast of good things, for our schools are not entirely 
filled from the refuse of all trades. 
Skilled labor in the mechanical arts alw comunands 
living wages, but skilled scientific labor in this county has 
not received justifiable compensation from this cause. Each 
year many of the proficient teachers have obtained more 
permanent and profitable employment in other fields, leaving 
many schools. to be filled by young and inexperienced 
teachers; hence the necessity of annual normal schools. 
Notwithstanding the many difficulties and drawbacks encoun- 
tered, the pupils attending the public schools have made 
progress beyond our most sanguine expectations. 
In many of the schools the higher mathematics, natural 
philosophy and the languages have been taught successfully 
and proficiently. 
We certainly believe the outloék in this county is brighten- 
ing, for crime has decreased as cducation has increased, 
verifying the assertion that “knowledge increases wisdom.”

GRUNDY. 
I have the honor herewith to submit my annual report, as 
Superintendent of this couuty, and I hope you will par- 
don the delay for not reporting cre this, but my excuse 
is that the tardiness of the clerks and treasurers of 
several of the districts has been such that it has been impos- 
sible to report earlier without considerable detriment to the 
interests of a great many children of the county. Ihave had 
to attend in person in some districts, in order to procure the 
statistical information required, and you can see from the 
meagre salary allowed, that I am illy able toaftordit. Ihave 
visited all the schools of the county one time, several 
of them twice, and a few three times. [ am glad to report 
that we have had a more competent corps of teachers the 
past year than usual,and the fruits of the same are clearly 
visible, from the fact that the pupils have made greater 
progress, beside there has becn a better attendance. The’ 
patrons too, I think, are continuing to grow more in favor 
of the law than heretofore. Iam of the opinion, however, 
that several changes in the law would be beneficial. First— 
let the directors be appointed by the County Superintendent; 
so by this means competent. persons would be chosen— 
whereas in a great many instances, under the present system, 
men are elected that are not competent to perform the 
duties required by law. Second—I am in favor of the State 
Jevying’a tax and disbursing to the several counties according 
to scholastic population. Third-—I am in favor of some kind 
of compulsory system. There are other minor changes that 
T think necessary, but will not state them at present. : 
In conclusion, I will say, that taking everything into con- 
sideration, I am glad to be able to report to your Honor 
considerable advancement over any previous year, and hope 
we may stil} continue to improve. ,

T have the honor to submit-this my eighth annual report as

While I do not claim any degree of credit to myself for the 
fact, yet 1 think I can safely say we have made decided 
progress,
-P-A-G-E-65
65 
The great obstacle we have had to encounter has been a 
disposition on the part of directors to cut down teachers’ 
salaries. Until there is a change here, we cannot make our. 
schools what they ought to be. First-class ability will com- 
mand a price, and if those who employ our teachers are 
unwilling to pay it, other purchasers will be found. We 
cannot afford to employ second and third-class men and 
women in our schools; but such we must put up with, unless 
we can bring ourselves to pay the price of a first-class 
article. True, it is some consolation to the teacher to know 
that his labors tend to elevate his kind, and to believe that 
the world is better for his having lived in it; but it would 
also be rather a consoling thought to know that he is making 
at least half as much money by his brain-taxing labors as he 
could make by peddling lightning-rods or “‘bossing a job” on 
the railroad. I desire to repeat what I have said heretofore: 
Much credit is due to the County Court of Hamblen County 
for the success of her schools. They have stood by the 
schools at all times and under all circumstances, and I feel 
confident they will continue to do so. 
Our Trustee, too, has nobly done his part. Hamblen 
County teachers are as promptly paid as any in the State. 
Having determined to retire from the school work, I desire, 
in this.my last report, to state briefly what, as the result of 
eight years’ experience as a school officer, I regard as essen- 
tial to the perfect success of our public school system. 
First, we want more money—money to do that which 
money alone can do. Then. we want skilled, professional 
teachers—well-trained, well-paid teachers—teachers who 
know what to do and how to do it. 
And lastly, we want a rigid system of supervision—-such 
supervision as will give unity of plan and concert of action. 
When we can boast of these-three requisites to success, the 
problem of the education of our people will have been 
solved.

HANCOCK. 
In submitting herewith my report of the schools of Han- 
cock County, I regret to say that it is not correct in every 
particular. The enrollmeut in schools and the average daily 
attendance, with the average cost of tuition per pupil per 
month, are only approximated results, vet I think they are 
about correct. : 
Owing to the tardiness of district clerks, the non-per- 
formance of the duties incumbent upon the teachers to return 
their abstracts, and the want of power in the Superintendent 
to compel them, under the act of the last Legislature, in re- 
pealing the law that required school warrants to be approved 
by the Connty Superintendent, I have been utterly unable to 
procure the information necessary to make a report more 
nearly correct. 
The fault, however, is not altogether in the teachers for not 
returning abstracts, for, as you are aware, the Superintendents 
of this county have not been accustomed to making annual 
reports to your office, consequently they have not required. 
reports of the district clerks and teachers: nor ought the 
Superintendents to bear the blame atone, from the fact they 
have never been allowed a sufficient salary to justify them in 
attending to the matter as they should. 
T have, since my term of office began, which was on the 
first Monday in August last, ascertained the exact condition 
of the several districts of the county in regard to their school 
funds, which for the first time in eight years has been known. 
There has not been as much as an apportionment of the 
funds made to the districts for four years, consequently 
many of the districts have ignorantly gone in debt. 
We have no uniform series of text-books, no maps, charts 
or any aids of the kind in the county, but notwithstanding
-P-A-G-E-67
these deficiencies, with many other bartiers, a majority of 
teachers have made a marked progress in their schools over 
any preceding vear. : 
lam proud to say that there is clearly manifested an in- 
creased interest and a still growing sentiment in favor of the 
public schools, and what we need in this county to make 
them a success is more money—the augmentation of the 
school funds to such an extent as would enable the continu- 
ance of the schools to five months, a willingness on the part 
of the directors to increase the wages of first-class teachers, 
a reasonable remuneration granted the district clerks for 
their services, and a sufficient salary allowed the Superinten- 
dent to justify a man of “literary and scientific qualifications” 
to assume and perform the duties of the office. 
A. J. TYLER. 
HARDEMAN, 
1 herewith submit to vou my second annual report of the 
public schools of Hardeman County, Tenn,, for the scholas- 
tic year ending June 30, 1882. T have to reiterate the same 
statement made in my last year’s report, namely: that the 
meager salary allowed the County Superintendent of this 
county for his service has rendered it simply impossible for 
me to visit all the schools in the county during the year. For 
to have done this I would have been forced to give up my 
situation as teacher. However, I have visited many of the 
schools and conferred with all the school directors concern- 
ing the condition, prosperity and management of the schools 
of their respective districts. I have also consulted with 
the teachers, and have endeavo:ed to establish a uniform 
system of text-books. I have held four Teachers’ Institutes. 
They were all well attended by the people, but not well at- 
tended by the teachers of the county. It is very difficult to 
get the teachers to attend these institutes, because there is 
one class of teachers who dread to he ériticised, and another 
class who are in such a state of lethargy and indifference 
that they do not strive to make any progress or improvement 
in their methods of. teaching. 
Judging from the large attendance of the people, the great 
interest manifested, and close attention given by them during 
the sessions of these institutes, I feel justified in saying that 
they accomplished incalculable good.  
-P-A-G-E-68
68 
The. functions of the Teachers’ Institute are two-fold, 
namely: first, to instruct teachers in their duties—in other 
words “to teach teachers how to teach;” secondly, to create 
more enthusiasm among the people in the cause of education. 
Believing that ‘the success of the public school system 
depends very largely on the quality of its teaching force, and 
that great caution should be taken in the selection of teach- 
ers, I have taken especial pains in’ conducting the examina- 
tions to ascertain the literary qualifications of the applicants, 
and to grade them conscientiously in each branch. I have 
held written examinations almost entirely, because written 
answers have the advantage over verbal that they exhibit 
some important items in other departments of primary in- 
struction, such as penmanship, orthography, use of capitals, 
punctuation, forms of expressions, and practical grammar, 
which do not sufficiently appear in oral examinations. 
Our schools are making, slow, yet sure and steady 
progress. There has been a great improvement made in our 
school buildings. A few years ago most of the school houses 
in both the rural districts and villages were very inferior, and 
some not a little uncomfortable. But now almost every dis- 
trict and village is supplied with very good school houses, 
most of them well furnished. Our teachers are, as a class, 
improving and doing good work. We have in the county 
some splendid teachers, who have prepared themselves for 
their work, who are zealous and enthusiastic, and are devo- 
ting their best talents and energies to their profession. Still 
we have many teachers, or rather sleepers, who, as I have 
before said, are careless and indifferent to the success of their 
schools, who are working merely for the money, and some of 
whom, in fact, are incompetent‘ holding low-grade certifi- 
cates, which, under the present school law, the Superin- 
tendents are compelled to grant. 
Another trouble is a constant changing of teachers, espe- 
cially in the country schools. The average rural school 
experiences a change of administration each term, and in 
towns the mobility of teachers is not a little surprising. 
The status of the teacher is not very satisfactory. It re- 
quires high art to educate a child, The frequent changing of 
teachers is calculated to drive the best talent from the field. 
The status of the teacher should be made more satisfactory. 
‘We should multiply our normal schools and make them 
better. We should increase the teachers’ salaries, and press
-P-A-G-E-69
69 
forward the whole work of lifting teachers up toa higher 
professional plane. 
Experience has proved that by a proper supervision ‘the 
standard and qualification of our teachers can be raised, and 
a higher educational tone can be diffused among the people. 
The best as well as the poorest teachers can be made much 
better and more efficient. 
“The absolute necessity of having. an organizer and leader’ 
to direct the work of a hundred isolated teachers, many of 
them without experience, is just as apparent to the mind of 
an intelligent person as it is that a railroad should have a 
superintendent, or that a manufacturing establishment should 
have a foreman, or that any business employing a large num- 
ber of hands should have some one to lead, plan, criticise. 
and help.” Yet we find that superintendency needs defense, 
for should the next Legislature repeal as much of the County 
Superintendent’s power as the Legislature of 1881 did, they 
had just as well abolish the office. I believe that the repeal- 
ing of the authority granted to County Superintendents was 
a very short-sighted policy and most disastrous to the suc- 
cessful operation of the public school system.. The County 
Superintendent now has no power to secure prompt or cor- 
rect reports from the district directors or to get the teachers 
to make out and return their abstracts. The result is, some 
of the directors are slow and careless about making out their 
reports, and half the teachers do not return their abstracts, 
Hence this part of the Superintendent’s report is of necessity 
inaccurate and very unsatisfactory. 
The County Superintendent's office was established to 
guard, protect and promote the school interest. The Super- 
intendent’s duty to audit the school warrants was the only 
protection over the public school fund. Repealing this law 
opened a broad road for fraud and forgery. T earnestly hope 
that the next General Assembly will take some active steps 
towards remedying these evil 
But to make our schools a success we must have more 
funds. The average term of the public school is entirely too 
short. We must increase the school tax to make the system 
more efficient. The laws and customs of the country are in 
perfect harmony in regard to this act: public opinion ap- 
proves, and even insists upon a higher tax for school pur- 
poses, so evident has it become to every one that the future 
of the American people will be whatever it’s schools make it.

HAYWOOD. 
I herewith submit another annual report of the public 
schools of Haywood County. We have made no marked 
improvement since my last report, nor have we yet removed 
the obstacles that have retarded our progress from the begin- 
ning. We still contend with a want of interest in our 
schools, some prejudice, no uniformity of text-books, and in 
some instances with incompetent and inefficient directors. 
Many of these latter will often insist on the license and em- 
ployment of cheap and incompetent teachers, simply on 
account of some local attachment or relationship. We have 
employed some teachers of this kind during the past vear, 
who I fear have accomplished comparatively little good. We 
want in our public schools faithful and competent teachers— 
men and women who will not only teach in the school room, 
but who, by their zeal and enthusiasm in their work, will in- 
. spire interest in the cause of education wherever they go: 
In this county we should have fewer schools and fewer and 
better teachers. The financial condition of the county is 
very good, Most of the teachers get their money as soon as 
their time is out. Our County Court did not levy a tax for 
school purposes for the year 1882, owing to some heavy 
appropriations which had to be made on account of the pre- 
valence of smallpox last winter. The court has been levying 
a reasonable tax for this purpose for several years, and we 
fecl assured will continue to do so after this vear. 
Our attendance was not as good as it ought to have been. 
Many of those to whom the public schools are especially 
given are indifferent as to whether their children attend 
school or not. We are not discouraged, however, by the pres- 
ent condition of things, and shall continue to hope that the 
day will soon come when all of éur people, without dis- 
tinction of race, shall be in hearty sympathy and co-opera- 
tion with the great public school system of the State. 
B. L. CAPELL. 
  HENRY. 
I have only a few words. We are advancing. As you 
perhaps know, Henry County never levied any tax for 
schools till 1880, and only 10 cents then. In 1881-82 the tax 
was raised to 15 cents on property and the poll increased 50
-P-A-G-E-71
71 
cents. Henry County never had a teachers’ meeting that 
lasted longer than one day until this summer. I succeeded in 
having a one-day meeting last summer. This summer the - 
meeting continued one week. The teachers were earnest, 
industrious and regular in attendance. They receive better 
pay than formerly. We have much to encourage us. 
The cost per pupil per-month has reference to strictly free 
schools. It is impossible to get perfectly reliable reports, 
with the power of approval of warrants taken away from 
County Superintendents and the free school, in many in- 
stances, combined with private schools. I had to make the 
second visit to one teacher to get her to use the “Teachers’ 
Register.” I have done the best in my power, yet I see a 
great lack of correctness. We are in a much better condi- 
tion than ever before. Our schools will average a term of 
four months this year. We have raised the grade of teach- 
ers. Teachers were charged a dollar for certificates, and it 
was said that anybody who had a dollar could get a certifi- 
cate. The dollar was a part of teacher’s salary. I declined 
to takefit, and by so doing the people have more confidence in 
the free schools. I am of opinion that we will have five 
months schools next year. Opposition to the system and 
principle is decreasing. Our county would carry five months 
tax by at least 2,000 majority now. : 
J. W. DOUGLASS. 
HICKMAN. 
I have nothing new to add to the many reports | have 
already made, yet I cannot permit this opportunity to pass 
without referring to the amendments made to the school law 
in 1879, and particularly to the amendment repealed in 1881. 
I was in 187g informed by ‘the Senate Committee on Public 
Schools that I was the person who first suggested the 
“County Superintendent's Approval” clause, and hence I 
believed in its importance before it became the law, and now 
I wish to bear testimony to the necessity of continuing that 
safe-guard. This I know from my experience as fat as my 
county is concerned. By this amendment, and by this alone, 
I was enabled to save to the school fund many hundred dol- 
lars. Were it not for the authority that was vested in me by 
that amendment, warrants for upwards of fourteen hundred 
dollars, procured by falsehood and various cunning misrepre-
-P-A-G-E-72
72 
sentations, would have been paid to parties’ appropriately 
termed map swindlers. J am, therefore. in favor of restoring 
that amendment, for by it the County Superintendent is . 
enabled to be the guardian of the school fund: without it, he 
is a mere figurehead. 
W. P. CLARK. 
HOUSTON. 
The schools in this county are improving to some extent; 
the people are taking a greater interest than ever before, 
which shows the present system is gaining in popularity. 
Our schools continue longer each year, and a better grade of 
teachers are employed The County Superintendent, in his 
report for next year, can show a marked improvement, both 
in schools and teachers. 
Our schools for the present vear will continue about five 
months, with a larger attendance than heretofore. 
1. F. McMILLAN. 
HUMPHREY 
I herewith transmit report for the scholastic year ending 
June 30, 1882. On the first Monday in July last I was 
elected Superintendent by our County Court to fill the unex- 
pired term of James Waggoner, who had resigned. Hence 
the year for which this report. is made had closed before I 
came into office, and'in making my report I have had to de- 
pend largely upon the papers and records turned over to me 
by my predecessor. A number of papers and reports which 
should have been on file in his office were never delivered to 
me, and on this account my report is somwhat defective. 
So far as I can Jearn the schools of this county were mod- 
crately successful during the past year. They did ‘not con-— 
tinue in session, however, for as long a time as was desirable, 
on account of the scarcity of funds. 
The small-amount of money appropriated for schools is 
one of the great difficulties we haye to meet in this county— 
another is the lack of trained teachers for our schools; but 
these we can never have until we can pay better salaries and 
keep the schools in session longer. We hope té improve in 
this respect in the future. Our County Court, at the last 
   
-P-A-G-E-73
73 
’ January term, levied for school purposes a poll tax of 50 
_cents, a property tax of ro cents on the $100 worth, and a 
privilege tax equal to one-third of the State privilege tax. 
The public schools are growing in favor in this county and 
a majority of the people are willing and anxious that the 
County Court shall levy a much larger tax for school pur-- 
poses than we now have. 
An earnest effort will be made at the next January term of 
the court to have a tax levied which will be sufficient to con- 
tinue our schools at least five months in the year. 
DANIEL B. JOHNSTON. 
JACKSON. 
In submitting this report I regret to say that it is not cor- 
rect in every respect. The Trustee’s report does not show 
the amount received from county and other sources sepa- 
rately. The free schools of this county are still growing in 
favor with the people—so much so that we have but little 
opposition from any source. The directors are manifesting 
more interest in repairing and building houses, schools are 
much better attended and much better supplied with books 
than heretofore, J am of opinion that the school law should 
be so amended as to make the Superintendent collector and 
disburser of the school funds. The same money paid to the 
Superintendent that is now paid to the Trustee would give 
the Superintendent better pay than he now gets, and’ would 
save the amount now paid the Superintendent by the County 
Court. I also believe that the law shonld compel every 
teacher engaged in teaching in the public schools to attend 
as many as two institutes during each year. Teachers in my 
county can not be induced to attend. I have made several 
efforts to get up a regular organization, but have not been 
able to do much as yet. 
As our school law is now contained in several pamphlets, 
I think it would. be a good plan to have all the law placed in 
one. It would be more convenient, to say the least of it.

JAMES. 
By reference to former reports from this office, you will 
observe a steady increase in the scholastic population, school 
fund, and number of schools, with the largest enrollment we 
have ever had. The character of schools taught is greatly 
improved in some localities, but is not general. On account 
of the disposition of some of our directors to let schools to 
the lowest bidder, regardless of the attainments of the 
applicant, our schools have suffered somewhat. Our 
best teachers have been driven from the field. Although 
I must acknowledge that we have the best teachers I ever 
knew of at the wonderfully low salary of $26.76 per month. 
Now we have enrolled in school 1,176 pupils out of 1,734. 
Why is it that all of 558 children could not have been en- 
rolled, or at least a portion of them, at some time during 
eighty days? When there is no visible cause, we will advo- 
cate a compulsory amendment until we are convinced that it 
is not advantageous. 
‘You will find our report as full and complete as we can 
make it from the statistics furnished us after much delay. 
Since the repeal of the law requirimg the approval of the 
Superintendent, &c., he is left without any compulsory 
means, and the salary paid by this county is so small that our 
means of getting up reports are very poor. Our schools are 
not what they should be, nor what they could be, by proper 
supervision, but owing to the salary we have to make a divis- 
ion of our time.

In submitting my second, and last report, I take pleasure 
in stating that the eommon school cause in our county is mak~- 
ing slow but sure progress. We have recently visited more 
than fifty schools in the county, and find the attendance much 
larger than heretofore. 
W. L. JONES. 
: JOHNSON. . 
I have the honor herewith to transmit my report for 1881~ 
82. Itis as near correct as I could make it from the reports ~
-P-A-G-E-75
75 
furnished me by teachers and directors. It has been with 
some difficulty that I have been able to obtain reports from 
teachers and directors this year. 
The public schools of Johnson County were very good last 
year. The school directors employcd, as a general thing, 
qualified teachers, who did their duty very well. The enroll- 
ment was not quite as good as the year preceding, owing to 
the fact that at two of the school houses there was no school 
taught. Our teachers were better and more promptly paid 
last year than for many years. The school fund was promptly 
collected and paid over to the teachers. Our school war- 
rants were par. This gave new energy to our teachers, and 
was an incentive to do more work than usual. 
The school directors and patrons of the different schools 
took more interest than usual in visiting and looking after the 
interest of their schools. They did more to encourage their 
teachers than ever before; did more to supply the pupils with 
the proper school-books than usual, and to make their houses 
more comfortable and pleasant. But there is great room for 
improvement in this particular. Still our people are grad- 
ually coming up to the great work of building and furnishing 
our school houses with proper furniture and tools to work 
with. The citizens of our county, as a general thing, are 
supporters of our free common schools. They are becoming 
favorites of the people. The system is working well. 
Our County Court promptly levies the sehool tax every 
year—sufficient to run most of the schools five months. It 
is now considered by them to be as much their duty to levy 
this tax as any other tax. It has not been referred to the 
people for several years. It was referred twice, several years 
ago, and was carried by large majorities. Our public school 
at this place [Tavlorsville] was consolidated with our graded 
school, and was an excellent school. The teachers, Profs. 
Matney and Keys. did splendid work. They enrolled one 
hundred and nineteen scholars. : 
The attendance at school last year was very good. Non- 
attendance and irregular attendance are great drawbacks to 
onr free schools. I am in favor of a compulsory school law. 
Hope that the subject will be presented to our next Legisla- 
ture and that they will pass a mild system of compulsory 
education. This alone will educate all of our children in the 
State. I am also in favor of our Legislature passing a law
-P-A-G-E-76
76 
adopting a uniform system of text-books for five or ten years. 
This might work a hardship for a while, but in the end 
would be greatly to the interest of education. 
The educational interest is growing rapidly in the county. 
Teachers’ institutes and meetings are doing more than any- 
thing else to improve the teachers and get up an interést 
among the people. 
I held a directors’ meeting, which was well attended. I 
think these meetings ought to be encouraged and held 
oftener. I attended several examinations last year. They 
were all well attended by the citizens. The students stood 
very good examinations. 
Free and universal education is the only hope we have for 
prosperity and happiness in the future. It is the only safe- 
guard for our free institutions. .

_ My report has been delayed this year on account of severe 
sickness of our County Trustee. He has been very ill ever 
since the last of August. The report I make to you is a cor- 
rect statement of the reports made to me by the several 
school directors and teachers of the county. Schools in this 
county have been good this year. There has been’ more 
interest taken on the part of the patrons than for many years. 
- Directors and teachers have been more punctual in the dis- 
charge of their duty than any year previous. We could have 
better schools if we had more money. The want of money 
in this county is the great drawback of our public schools. 
There will be good private schools taught all over the county 
this winter, which will add much to the public school inter- 
est next fall. We anticipate good schools next year. 
Cc. A. CARRELL. 
“LOUDON. 
Our public schools in this county are in a very prosperous 
condition. We think the schools this year are doing a better 
work than last year. Our teachers are not as well posted in 
the branches required to be taught by law as they should be. 
Our financial condition is in good shape. We pay our 
teachers monthly. The average length of our schools this
-P-A-G-E-77
77 
year in months will be about four and a-half. 
We held a Teachers’ Normal this past summer, which 
opened June 26th, and continued four weeks. The atten- 
dance was small, there being about twenty present. Teach- 
ers’ Normals are of incalculable value to teachers. We 
notice our best teachers are always in attendance at the nor- 
mals, and the second and third grade teachers usually stay at 
home. 7 
My opinion is, the proper way for the County Superinten- 
dent to do is, to call a meeting of the school directors, say as 
early as April or May, let the directors resolve to have a 
County Normal. fix the time for holding it, and each man 
agree to do everything in his power to make the normal a 
success; fix a uniform time for opening their schools after the 
normal shall have closed, and furthermore, agree to pay 
teachers in proportion to their qualifications—say a teacher 
who holds a third grade certificate $20; a second grade $25; a 
first grade $30. This plan, we believe, would encourage 
teachers to better prepare themselves for their work. We 
must do something to elevate the standard of teachers in 
Tennessee. . 
I transmit to you a report of our schools which is as near 
correct as I can make it with the lights before me; do not 
claim it perfect, but consider it a very fair statement of our 
public schools. I have visited every school in the county, 
have spoken encouraging words to teachers and pupils. 
We consider the schools of this county in very good con- 
dition. 
JOHN W. HYDEN, 
MACON. 
The public schools of this county will be short this year. 
The people voted against the school tax, and hence our 
school fund is short. There are only about forty public 
schools now in the county. There is an academy in the 
county that I visited this week. This is Bellwood Academy, 
at Gibbs’ X Roads, under the management of Prof. W. 
Shelton. There are seventy-two pupils, classed as follows: 
Orthography, 72; Reading, yo: Writing, 4o: Arithmetic, 50: 
English Grammar, 30; Geography, 25; Algebra, 25; Geome- 
try, 3; Astronomy, 2; Trigonometry, 3; Chemistry, 3: Latin, 
2; Book-keeping. 8: Rhetoric, 6; Elocution, 72.

The Legislature, by some late act, has caused some trouble 
by repealing the act requiring County Superintendents to 
approve all schoo] warrants. The result of it is that the 
Trustee of the county has paid many school warrants that 
ought not to have been paid, and another trouble is that the 
County Superintendent is not now permitted to draw an 
order on the Trustee to pay clerks for reporting scholastic 
population. The law now provides no way for them to get 
a warrant for that service. By this erroneous legislation the 
County Superintendent can not compel the teachers to return 
the abstracts, and hence it is exceedingly troublesome for 
County Superintendents to make their report. I trust the 
attention of the next General Assembly will be called to 
these matters. 
M. N. ALEXANDER. 
  
MADISON. 
In making this, my second annual report, I am‘sorry to 
say it is necessarily very defective. The Trustee’s report 
shows that he has paid teachers’ salaries amounting to 
$18,775.44: whereas, the teachers’ abstracts reported to me 
show the amount paid to teachers to be $12,288.71; then .the 
Trustee has paid out $6,486.73 to teachers who have failed to 
report their schools through abstracts, which failure amounts 
to one-third of the enrolled pupils. &c., of our county. Add 
one-third to 7,676 and the amount is 10,234 enrolled out of a 
scholastic population of 11,413. This T regard as an excel- 
lent enrollment, and is much larger than in any previous year. 
Our teachers have done good work in the school rooms, but 
have failed to attend institutes when called on, and one-third 
of them have failed to furnish their abstracts as before stated. 
This is among the many evils that have grown out of the last 
amendments to the public school law. Many of our 
district school directors are wholly incompetent to discharge 
the duties of the position they occupy, and as long as this is 
the case schools can not flourish. 
Many directors are paying no attention to the qualification 
of teachers whatever. In some districts they are paying low 
grade teachers and first grade teachers the same salaries; in 
. some districts first grade teachers’ salaries fall below low 
grade teachers in other districts. The County Superinten-
-P-A-G-E-79
79 
dent should be invested with authority not only to regulate 
the salaries of teachers, but to contract with and employ 
them. Then, as his own character as an officer so greatly 
depends upon the intelligence and efficiency of his teachers, 
he will most assuredly select a better corps of teachers than 
we now have. It is the teachers that constitute the pivot 
upon whjch the wheels of success of the schools turn.

MAURY. 
T resigned the office of County Superintendent on the first 
Monday in July last. Up to the time of my resignation there 
was no material change to report, in progress or improve- 
ment, in the public schools of the county. The same diffi- 
culties exist that have heretofore been mentioned, some of the 
chief of which are the deficiency of the school fund, and 
the low salaries paid teachers. Over the first of these the 
school officers of the county have no power, and the second 
can not be remedied without shortening still further the 
. school terms, which are already foo short. We can not hope 
for much success until a legislative body of sensible and

State in view, shall meet at Nashville and enact some neces- 
sary amendments to the school law.

and is giving general satisfaction as County Superintendent.

T have the honor of submitting to you my fourth annual 
report of the public schools of McMinn County. I regret 
very much to say that it is not free from imperfections which 
are entirely beyond my power to control. IT do not believe
-P-A-G-E-80

any one can make a report who has to base it upon the re- 
ports of so many different men: however, I make it as correct 
as it can be done from the reports made to me by the differ- 
ent directors and teachers. A great many of our schools are 
not what they ought to be. The few cheerful signs 
which favor them are overshadowed by a great many hin- 
derances—one in particular, the want of funds to run a full 
term of five months.’ I have visited several schools and find 
that they are making some progress. Most of our teachers 
are young men and ladies who have had but little experience 
in teaching. We hope for the best.

I had my scholastic report for McNairy County sent to 
you for compilation with other details pertaining to the edu- 
cational interest of our county some time since. When the 
report was sent I was confined to my room by sickness. How 
full the report, I know not, though it was compelled to be 
meagre in some respects. We were without a Superinten- 
tendent a portion of the year. A great many of our schools 
were taken up in the summer, to be continued in the winter. 
From such schools we got no reports. In a great many schools 
the teaching were deferred until winter. We got very few 
reports from directors, giving value of property, &c. But I 
am happy to state that our free schools are being rapidly de- 
veloped: that we had a better class of teachers this year than 
ever before, a better attendance, and all we need now is more 
money and some few changes in our system, which T shall 
take the liberty of recommending when the General Assem- 
bly convenes.

T enclose you annual report, as required by law, showing a 
decrease of over one hundred in our scholastic population. 
Our schools are doing well, have a good class of teachers 
this year, and taking into consideration the theagre amount 
of funds that we have for distribution, the pubiic schools are 
doing exceedingly well.

. MONROE. 
I herewith submit my annual report, which is correct, sta- 
tistically and financially. Our schools are in’a prosperous 
condition. We are out of debt. "The teachers have, as a 
majority, been trained up in our County Normal School. 
The school houses are neat and comfortable. The free 
school system in our county is doing more to educate the 
masses than all other school interest combined. The system 
is one of the greatest public factors of a free and independent 
people. Thousands of children in the State would go uned- 
ucated were it not for our public schools. I am of opinion 
that our school law should be so amended as to make school 
officers more prompt in the performance of their duties. I 
am further of the opinion that the County Superintendent 
should be required to audit all school warrants, from the fact 
that school directors, in many instances, are very extrava- 
gant. The funds should be well guarded on all sides. None 
of the counties adjoining Monroe surpassed it in good public 
schools in any way. The system has but little opposition in 
our county. ‘ 
W. H. KIMBROUGH. 
  
MOORE, 
I regret that I am, from circumstances which T could not 
control, behind time in making my annual report. 
The school work of our county is increasing each year in 
interest with the masses. The attendance this year has been 
better than any previous One since the law was passed that 
inaugurated it; and, with proper management, each year will 
give new evidence that the public schools of the State are 
the foundation stones on which our government is founded, 
and is destined aggressively to conquer every civilized land 
around the world.

After some delay I have the pleasure of submitting my 
second annual report. I have delayed my report about one 
month in order to have it complete. 
Iam sorry that the last Legislature repealed the school law 
taking almost all the power that was vested in Superinten- 
dents.

R. B. Ware has been in this county with his agents, and 
has sold worthless apparatus to directors to the amount of 
about $200.00, The most of them will not report it. They 
consider it, after mature deliberation, entirely worthless. ~ 
The schools of this county, considering everything, are 
doing well. There are schools in twenty-seven districts. 
The teachers are better qualified and are using more energy 
than they have ever used. The people are more interested 
than I ever saw them in school matters. They have learned 
that it takes the very best men in each district to fill the 
office of school director, and they are electing some of the 
best men in the county to fill the office. and we are seeing 
the benefits from their official acts. I hope the time is near 
at hand when we can get rid of incompetent teachers and 
supply their places with first-class teachers, I tried to get 
the teachers to attend institutes last year, and failed to get 
them interested in the work as they should have been. I 
hope the next Legislature will amend the law so as to com- 
pel them to give their attention to normal institutes, and if 
they refuse to comply with the law, refuse them positions in 
the public schools. 
L. BRASEL. 
  
OVERTON. 
In submitting this report am pleased to beable to state 
that there is, at least, some improvement in almost everything 
that pertains to the interest of the public schools. We have 
more first grade teachers this year, and fewer second and 
third grade, than in any previous year, which is certainly a 
decided improvement. We have had an increase of from 15 
to 20 per cent. of the first grade every year for the last four 
or five years over the previous year, while the total number 
of teachers has remained about the same, 
The lack of sufficient means to run our schools more 
than two or three months in the yearis a greater drawback 
on the progress of our schools than anything with which 
they have to contend. As home aid is very limited, and in 
all probability will continue to be so, I most earnestly hope 
we may receive National aid, as propused by Senator Blair's 
educational bill, or otherwise. If we can receive the amount 
proposed by the Blair bill, we can hereafter run our schools 
six or eight months in the year. When this can be done, we
-P-A-G-E-83
83 
can secure the best and most experienced teachers, at a salary 
that will be at least encouraging. All this will create such 
an interest in public educaiion that in a few years our South- 
ern schools will almost be the peers of the Northern and 
Eastern schools. Then let every means be brought about to 
secure National aid. 
Ithink the opposition to public schools is growing less 
every year. Many citizens of my county are desiring a tax’ 
levied sufficient to run the schools five months in each year, 
and T believe it will be submitted to a vote within the com- 
ing year. Our County Court has levied $1.25 on the poll for 
school purposes this year, instead of $1.00, as heretofore. 
Our directors have taken more interest in employing well 
qualified teachers than in previous years. Some districts 
asked for none bnt first grade teachers, while a majority | 
would not employ third grade. 
This report is not exactly as I desire, but is as correct as it 
could well be made from the reports sent me. 
Thelieve it would be advisable that there be a law enacted 
that directors have the same qualifications, when practicable, 
as those set forth in the eighth section of the Public School 
Law for county superintendents. This would, in many in- 
stances, seeure directors far more competent to discharge 
their duty. 
I think there is a better uniformity of text-books than 
heretofore, but not as good as could be desired. I believe 
our schools are better attended this ye2zr than they were last 
year. T held public written examinations. of teachers this 
year. I think they are an improvement over verbal examin- 
ations. A better grade of teachers with better salaries, more 
tax on the poll for school purposes, a longer average term, 
all. speak increasing interest and prosperity in our public 
schools. .

The enclosed report of this county is as full as I am able 
to make it with the limited information furnished by direc. | 
tors and teachers. If the law is not so amended as to attach 
some criminal liability for these neglects, I see no prospects 
for improvement in this direction. 1 have urged the impor- 
tance of this work on both teachers and directors, with like
-P-A-G-E-84
84 
result on both--neither seem to care a straw, The Trustee 
has not reported and will not, without assigning any reason 
for the neglect. I find by visiting the schools there is a gen- 
eral improvement in the way of scholarship—-both in teach- 
ers and pupils. There is a marked better feeling among the 
people generally on the subject of free schools and education. 
Our schools are so situated as to be very inconvenient for 
winter schools, the farms being situated on creeks and settlers 
sparse, so that some have to send two and three miles to 
school. I think the school for the past year will average 
about three and a-half months, with about 75 per cent. at- 
tendance, and not over 5 per cent. of the attendance that 
can not read. There is a considerable falling off of scholastic 
population, which I can account for in no other way than a 
great number of families have gone out of the county and 
‘State. 
  T. W. SIMS. 
  
PICKETT, 
T have labored under many disadvantages in making this 
report. Many of the teachers have failed to report to me, as. 
well as the County Trustee and many of the school directors. 
In this county the schools seem to be on gaining ground. 
L have given more first grade certificates this year than last. 
The teachers have received better wages, too. I have held 
two institutes this fall, which were very useful, although half 
the teachers in the county never attended. 
As the County Court makes no allowance for the County 
Superintendent, it can not be expected of him to devote his 
time to the business as if he were getting pay for his labor. 
‘ J. W. SMITH.   
‘POLK. 
The free schools of this county are doing much and lasting 
good in the way of educating the young and rising genera- 
tion throughout the land. In fact, they are the sources of 
learning to which boys and girls can resort for mental train- 
ing, without which they would be drones and dwarfs in this 
' great world of mental activity. The genial rays of light and 
learning have been shimmered down all o’er this land through 
their instrumentalities.. They are the life of the present and 
hope of the future.
-P-A-G-E-85

One of the greatest barriers to the progress of our schools 
at present is the extremely low salaries offered teachers; the 
result of which is, that the best and most proficient teachers 
are seeking’ employment elsewhere, and thus we are com- 
pelled to use second and third rate teachers. J believe this 
evil could be remedied by paying teachers according to the 
grade of their qualification uo 
Another obstacle in the way of progress is carelessness 
and indolence on the part of some parents, who allow their 
children to loiter out of school whenever it suits them, This 
class of people needs correction by the law, in order that 
their children may receive the benefits to be derived from the 
free school. 
The great diversity and lack of text-books is another almost 
insurmountable difficulty in the way of progress; and in 
order to eliminate this difficulty, the school officers of this 
county have recommended the introduction of Butler’s series 
of books. These books are gradually being introduced, and 
so far as I can ascertain, are giving general satisfaction. 
There is some marked improvement in the way of school 
discipline. Teachers are becoming better instructors from 
practice and experience. Parents are manifesting a deeper 
and more abiding interest in the educational welfare of their 
offspring.. 
One Mr. Weir, of Cannon County, Tenn., swept through 
this county last summer, and by grossly. false representations 
induced some of the directors to issue warrants for sets of 
school apparatus, on the grounds that he (Mr. Weir) would 
furnish them 4s cheap as they could be bought at any market. 
On finding out that such was the condition upon which said 
warrants were isstted I strongly protested against their liqui- 
dation, because the material sent in, instead’of being worth’ 
$38.00 per set, proved to be worth about $13.00; and after 
~ three unsuccessful attempts to convene those directors, a great 
many of whom denied ever signing the warrants, our trustee 
being urged by a young lawyer in whose hands they were 
deposited, paid them off at full value, and thus squandered 
about $200 of the school money: on which account some of 
our schools have been cut short this year. Such is the evil 
consequent to the repealing of the law that required the ap- 
proval of the warrants by county superintendents before 
their liquidation. .

PUTNAM. 
Thave been delayed in making my annual report by wait- 
ing on.delinquent district clerks, and finally had to go to the 
homes of some of them to get their reports. My present re- 
port shows a better enrollment and per cent. of attendance 
than any former report from this courity, And I think it 
would have been much better had it not been for the drouth 
of last year. The schools from which the present report was 
taken were taught during the months of July, August and 
September, 1851, when parents. were thinking more about 
their children suffering for food than they were about educa- 
ting them. 
As a whole our county is not in debt on account of schools. 
We have fifty-four school districts, some of which are in 
debt, while the balance have money to their credit. The 
credits exceed the indebtedness $66.21. The oulook for our 
free schools is very encouraging. They have almost entirely 
superseded private schools in our county. . 
As a proof of the good our public schools are doing, I will 
mention one instance of a little girl. 13 or 14 years old, in the 
district in which I live, who never attended a private school. 
She has about completed the free school curriculum. Her 
success is attributable to her strict attendance, which is an 
exception to the general rule in this county. While com- 
pulsory attendance may not be in strict accordance with our 
republican institutions, I believe it would be a good thing for 
our country. It is certainly unfair to tax a people for a bene- 
ficial purpose and allow them, through negligence, to lose 
the benefit of their money. There is‘one other point 1 would 
like for our Legislature to consider, and that is the time of 
electing directors. Their election comes in conflict with the 
county election, andis gencrally neglected. Their election— 
- or appointment as is generally the case—changes the board 
in the midst of the session, which sometimes causes a dis- 
turbance in school. I would suggest Saturday before April 
quarterly court as a suitable time to elect them,

The free schools are becoming prominent in the public 
mind in this county. A decided improvement is noticeable.

At the last election, in regard to the selection of directors, 
the interest manifested was cncouraging. The teachers’ 
meetings were not as well attended as they should have been. 
We need an amendment to school law, requiring all licensed 
teachers to attend institutes, &c. 
N. Q, ALLEN. 
-ROANE.’ 
The schools opened uniformly on the first Monday in 
August, and, I believe, with more interest manifested than in 
any previous year. 
The number enrolled, average daily attendance, &c., show 
a little increase over last year. 
There have been erected during the year several very 
commendable school buildings. . In some districts, however, 
the houses erected are very indifferent. 
We have had more money this year than usual, conse- 
quently the term of school has been lengthened. The inter 
est in our public schools seems to have been deepened and 
made more permanent throughout the county. 
A normal school was held at Poplar Creek Seminary for a 
term of four weeks, taught by Prof. M. W. Morrison, of 
Dayton, Rev. W. H. Crawford, of Poplar Creek Seminary, 
_ Prof. R. A. Sturgus, of Kingston, and myself. Fifty-two 
-applicants for the position of teacher were in attendance. It 
was a very highly successtul term, and awakened among the 
people generally a deep interest in public education. 
The normal school is a great deal more popular than when 
first introduced, four years ago. The salaries of first-class 
teachers have been increased. 
Most of our teachers have been doing very efficient work, 
which, no doubt, is owing to normal training. 
Text-books are nearly uniform. 
    
  
H. F. WHEAT. 
ROBERTSON. 
The school year just closed has been a very eventful one in 
the history of Tennes: The death of the Rev. Dr. Doak, 
your distinguished predecessor, cast a gloom over the entire 
educational work of the State: because everybody who was 
in any degree prominently comected with the public schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
88 
or private institutions of learning in the State, felt the true 
worth of this worthy man, who seemed to infuse his spirt of 
devotion and practical experience into everything he ever 
said or did. Dr. Doak was not an orator; he was a scholar 
and a worker, and made up for what he lacked in the power 
to carry men with him by his assiduity and zeal in the great 
work to which he had been called. I could but shed a tear 
to the memory of such a servant, who laid down his life in 
the very Aey-day of his prosperity. 
Sir, the problem of Tennessee’s destiny as a great educa- 
tional commonwealth is about to be solved. There is some 
sort of prejudice always preseut in the minds of many against 
any system of education, no matter how efficacious it may be. 
This is natural. But to the question of universal enlighten- 
_ ment, the most astute will now give way, and acknowledge 
that man’s mind was not intended for a receptacle of the 
sordid passions of “ untutored man.” but the reservoir where 
the limpid streams of truth find rest, like placid waters when 
they “ flow to their appointed end.” 
My work in Robertson County has been a two-fold work. 
The Jabor—the real, practical labor—in the school-room, 
where I have endeavored .to inspire the minds of children” 
with a true appreciation for the good and useful in life, has 
been scarcely less important than the holding of teachers’ 
institutes, where I could reach the common mind and educate 
public sentiment into a real appreciation of the absolvte ne- 
cessity of universal education. 
It is useless to endeavor to clothe the “ subject of this re- 
port” in the ermine of * fine linen,” because the experience 
of all nations, for at least twenty-five hundred years, has de- 
monstrated the efficacy of mind development, and it is verily 
the “croaker” who says, “ Hold, you go too fast; while the 
great tidal wave of truth, bears his bark onward upon its 
snow-crested bosom. . 
In this report, I must beg leave to request that you allow 
but one grade of certificates to be granted to teachers. Sev- 
eral years ago, before any normal schools wére established, 
the State Superintendent allowed (as is now allowed) three 
grades of certificates. This arrangement forced upon the 
schools many teachers—white and colored—wholly incom- 
petent to teach. That day has passed. We can now get 
first grade teachers for both white and colored schools, at 
about the same price; and then (if the day ever comes when
-P-A-G-E-89
89 
such a beneficent law is “ put in force”) the one great objec- 
‘tion argued against public schools by the most enlightened 
-class will pass away, , 
The:salaries of teachers have been in excess of what they 
were last year. This I thirtk is a good indication, as showing 
that men are not willing to ‘sacrifice their children’s destiny 
on the idea of mistaken economy, but would rather pay a man 
a just and reasonable compensation for his labor, than to have 
a “humbug” or “jockey” at any price. Economy is a good 
thing, but’ false economy does not only ruin individuals, but 
states and nations. 
It pleases me to state that we have had no ‘very serious 
difficulties in the local management of schools. Pupils are 
obedient, teachers industrious, and directors, in many instances, 
are attentive, yet they are not allowed any compensation 
for their services, except the clerk, who is lightly paid for 
enlisting the names of children between 6 and 21 years. 
1 extend to you my words of good cheer in this the begin- 
ning of another’ year. My heart and hand are in the work 
to which my office calls me, and I assure you.that Iam more 
than willing to co-operate with you in any way. that will be 
conducive to the building up,of the cause of f learning | in the 
Old Volunteer State, 
May God’s richest blessings rest upon you in the dischargd 
of your ‘labors, i is my sincerest wish,

Our school system is improving. The railroad is paying 
us quite well, which helps our schools to a great exterit. The 
directors are very dilatory about looking after the schools 
and making their reports. The citizens are, many of them, 
dilatory in sending their children to school. It seems that they 
cannot become interested. We have some good teachers and 
some very bad ones, though they are improving very much. 
I think our schools are doing as well as could be expected, 
considering everything. I organized an institute, but there 
_ was a small attendance. Our schools:are not,in debt now. 
I stopped them last year, so the teachers could get nearly all 
of their money when their time was out. I think this year 
we will have three and a-half or four months schools. 
JASPER HUGHETS. 
  
SHELBY. 
I herewith submit my report of the free schools of Shelby 
County for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1882: 
Tam happy to be able to state that the free schools of 
Shelby County are in a decidedly more flourishing condition 
than ever before. There is a fecling of enthusiasm for the 
free school in this county, Patren, teacher and pupil are in 
harmony. There are no private schools in the county, and 
should the frée schools continue to improve, the private 
schools will be known only in the history of the past. I have 
devoted my entire time the past year to the work of improv- 
ing the schools. I have visited the schools, some of them 
several times. As required by the State Superintendent I 
held public examinations. At these examinations the ques- 
tiens are placed on the blackboard; the applicant is expected 
to answer in writing. On his answers the certificate is graded 
and the answers filed in the office for future reference. 
Feeling the great need of well qualified teachers, in June I 
held, for two weeks, a teachers’ or normal institute, in two 
departments, one for white. and one for colored teachers. 
The institute was conducted by teachers of great educational 
experience and ability. The white department’ was held in 
Bartlett, our county town, and was attended by seventy-six 
teachers,.who ‘went away thoroughly imbued with the im- 
portance of keeping up with the progress made in recent
-P-A-G-E-91
91 
years in teaching. The work done combined both topic and 
narrative. We had a programme which governed us in our 
daily work, but the teachers in attendance clamored for more 
work. Ican conscientiously say that I never saw a class so 
earnestly, honestly, studious; from early in the morning 
until late at night they, might be seen in groups and classes 
bending every energy, quizzing, taking notes, studying, any- 
thing, everything but idling, The directors in the county 
are now wide awake as to the importance of the.-work done 
in the institute. Those teachers are employed in preference 
to all others. 
The colored department was held in the LaMoyne, Mem- 
phis, a finely organized institute for educating colored 
teachers. Our County Normal was held during the vacation 
of the LaMoyne, was conducted by the teachers of the 
LaMoyne, and was a complete success; 115 teachers in at- - 
tendance. Iam fully convinced that it was the most com- 
plete and successful colored County Normal that was ever 
held in the South. The teachers seemed to be imbued with 
that ardor and enthusiasm which permeated the white class at 
Bartlett--many of the teachers being graduates from educa- 
tional institutes in different sections of the United States 
and Canada. We had all the conveniencies belonging to the 
LaMoyne, such as blackboards, charts, maps, globes, cuts, 
drawings, cabinets, &c., including a library of several thou- 
sand volumes, with the vast experience of the teachers of the 
LaMoyne. I would particularly mention that efficient and 
worthy principal, A. J. Steele. Just here allow me to thank 
you, and through you that big hearted philanthropist,. Dr. J. 
L.M. Curry, agent of the Peabody Fund, for $200, which was 
used to defray the expenses of the colored department of the 
County Normal. 
The colored teachers in the summer of 1881 organized a 
Colored County Teachers’ Association. They meet the last 
Saturday in every month, at the LaMoyne, and do institute 
work, under the conductorship of Prof. A. J. Steele. You 
can scarcely imaginz the good that is being done by these 
meetings, Note-book in hand, eager to catch every idea as 
it falls from the lips of the conductor or is exhibited or ex- 
plained by the numerous apparatus belonging to the institute. 
These teachers are being improved and improving themselves 
in a ratio scarcely to be computed. 
Seeing the great good doné the colored teachers by the
-P-A-G-E-92
92 
association, the white teachers organized a County Teachers’ 
Association in June last. This is doing a.great good. We 
meet in “Memphis i in a large school house, (the Market Street 
school house), and do institute work about once every two 
months. Thejmeetings are largely and enthusiastically at- 
tended. The"teachers of Shelby County are wide awake, 
and the enthusiasm of the new methods and normal work is 
at a fever heat. . 
You may find seemingly some discrepancy in. my statisti-. 
cal report. It is not real, but owing to Memphis (taxing 
district) and Shelby County being merged in some things 
pertaining to public schools and separate in others. .Qur 
school houses are very much improved. There is not a house! 
but has a blackboard. Many have charts, wall maps, &c.. 
. The directors in nearly all of the districts are. making rapid 
strides toward furnishing the school houses and improving 
the school houses and grounds. . Taking it all in all-our 
public schools are something of -which we are justly very 
proud. We need one thing more, and that one. thing is 
equivalent to all things else, that is more money, more money. 
Our teachers are preparing themselves for more and better . 
work, and we must.pay them for this better: work,. or they 
will go where they will be better paid. Without plenty of 
money, we can not keep well qualified and competent teachers. 
The trite old sacred quotation, “the laborer is worthy of his 
hire,” is applicable to the teacher. 
W. L. HENDERSON. 
SEQUATCHIE. 
Our schools have not been marked by any special prosper- 
ity during the past year, though the outlook is favorable. 
We have had some good schools, taught by good teachers. 
The attendance isnot as large as it might be, owing mainly 
to a general want of interest on the part of those to whom 
the public schools are given. In some districts inefficient 
and Careless directors have given me additional*labor, and in 
several instances I have b- en forced to make out their reports. 
They complain that they are not sufficiently paid for their 
services, and are therefore careless and indifferent in the dis- 
charge of their duties. 
We have established a uniformity of text-books. We have
-P-A-G-E-93
93 
held four teachers’ meetings during the year, all of which 
were well attended and interesting. I have Visited most of 
the schools in the county and’ found them generally in good _ 
condition and the people pleased with their progress. , 
May we all climb higher and higher in the great cause of 
education, and all be made alive in its lasting goodness.”

be, yet I have spared no pains to make it full and complete 
in every ‘particular. 
I am-satisfied that the Legislature made a mistake in repeal- 
ing the law authorizing county superintendents to approve 
the school orders. I held a county normal institute of nine 
days, at Liberty Academy, which was tolerably well attend- 
ed, and resulted in much good to the teachers. 
I am. under’ obligations to some of our most prominent 
teachers,:and also to Prof. Frank M. Smith, of Memphis, for 
their timely aid in conducting the institute. To these insti- 
tutes Sullivan County is-indebted for all the Progress and im- 
provement in the art of teaching. ‘ 
I think all the teachers not attending the’ State Normal 
should be compelled to attend the County Institutes. I am 
also of the opinion that we should havea compulsory school 
law in the State. 
The’ State Superintendent was expected to visit the county . 
in May last, but was Providentially hindered. Our people’ 
expect your Honor to visit us this fall. 
One great drawback to progress here is the want of better | 
houses.. We have- some excellent houses, but not enough of 
them. 
There is, I am happy to say, & steady educational progress 
in the county. :

SUMNER. 
Our schools are in good coridition generally. The taxes 
levied aie not sufficient to make our system a success. Our 
county is ‘carrying a heavy railroad debt or tt would wil-
-P-A-G-E-94

lingly, I think, vote an additional school tax. The_ problem 
now to be solved is, how can we get the attendance of the 
children? The system is becoming more popular, and I am 
satisfied that with brain and energy on the part of our educa- 
tors that but a few years will elapse until we will have a 
public school system that will be an honor to our people.

My report for scholastic year ending June 30, 1882, is here- 
with submitted. Owing to the change in the law doing 
away with the approval of warrants by County Superinten- 
dents, teachers, in several instances, have failed to file their 
abstracts, and this report in consequence is not precisely cor- 
rect. This change in the law was, in my opinion, a great 
mistake, 
Lhave visited the majority of the schools of the county, 
and am glad to report them in a more presperous condition 
than last year. Seven new school houses have been erected 
and several others are in process of building, which are not in- 
cluded in this report, but they are nearly all poorly supplied 
with school furniture and apparatus. We have held three 
teachers’ meetings, one well attended, and all resulting favor- 
bly. Another will be held commencing October 26th. 
Although I report an increased interest in the schools 
throughout the county, yet Ido not see how they are to be 
made eminently successful unless by increased taxation. Our 
funds are generally sufficient to conduct the schools for 
three months by dint of employing a few cheap (?) teachers, 
and the private schools are so poorly patronized after the 
free term closes that even a, cheap teacher can not make a 
living, The result is, our most efficient teachers are. forced, 
in the interim, to engage in some more lucrative occupation. 
The fact is, the more competent teachers make this a step- 
ping-stone. 
I must not neglect to mention the effort which is being 
made on the part of some ot our citizens to raise sufficient 
funds within the next year to offer as a prize to the most 
efficient pupil, in a competitive examination on the public 
school studies, a free scholarship in one of the universities of 
the State, iacluding all expenses, examination tottake place

in the month of June, 1883. The credit of originating this 
scheme is due to Col. Wm. Sanford, of this place, who is an 
earnest advocate of the public school system. A considera. 
ble amount has already been secured. 
In conclusion I will say that I believe our schools are 
steadily progressing, and as soon as our people become con- 
vinced that the school law is a fixture, it is to be hoped that 
they will use every effort to make it more successful in its 
operations.

This is a small county in population and territory. Our 
tax books show our wealth to be small, also. As a conse- 
quence our school funds are limited, making’ our schools 
short, and as a matter of course we can not realize as much 
benefit as we would were we able to prolong our public 
schools. 
We have been able to report an increase in population and 
enrollment, and we can truthfully state that we have better 
houses and the people are taking more interest in education 
than usual in our count. Our schools are opening with 
good prospects for better success than we have ever had be. 
- fore. Some of our school houses have been repaired. The 
teachers are becoming better posted. To make it short, the 
subject of educatioa in our little county is taking a boom 
My report is not complete, but it is as nearly so as I could possi- 
bly make it.

My report will be short. There is a great deal more inter- 
est manifested in the public schools in the county now than 
has been felt in a long while. We show our schools to be in 
operation for seventy day s, which is longer than ever before 
in our county. 
Our County Court Jevied an additional tax of 10 cents on 
the hundred dollars’ worth of taxable property, so that our 
apportionment will approximate $1.10 fer capita of the free 
school population.

We had a Normal School, conducted at Maynardville, re- 
sulting in material aid to the teachers in attendance. . 
We have forty-six schools in operation in’ the. county. T 
have visited thirty-six of them up to date. I find them doing 
better than our schools have done formerly. -

But few schools have been in operation in my county the 
present year, owing to the districts getting in debt by run- 
ning the schools so long last year. Those in operation con- 
tinued but a short time, for want of funds. I thought it 
expedient to let. every district get out of debt. I have 
received no report from the County Trustee as to the. school 
funds in highands. Hence Iam unable to make my.report-any 
fuller in that respect, and on account of directors and teach- 
ers not making their reports in time, there are many. things T 
am compelled to leave unreported.

Having entered upon my: official duties since the termina- 
tion of the scholastic year for which the accompanying’ sta- 
tistics-are submitted, I have Visited no’ schools, and hence 
-must rely wpon such papers as are filed in my office for the’ 
correctness of my annual report. . : 
‘By reference to the statistics of the county you will observe 
that the interest in our common schools is gradually increas- 
ing, yet teachers’ salaries, in some localities, have been re- 
duced so low as to render it impossible to secure the services 
of men who are able to inspire the community with* that 
degree of enthusiasin which the spirit of the age demands. 
Not until teachers receive a-reasonable remuneration for their 
services can we.even hope to secure men and women who 
are competent and willing to put forth their energies for the 
improvement and the advancement of educatiotial systems. 
.. The idea that it would be better to abolish our public 
schools system unless they are longer in session and rendered 
‘more efficient, is very prevalent among the peopy: But lam 
“pleased to say that we are gradually increasing the length of

our schools, and swelling our public funds which must ine- 
vitably lead to a better system of instruction. 
When our fund is sufficient to run our schools five months 
per annum, to allow teachers better salaries, and to justly 
compensate directors and Superintendents for work properly 
done, then will those who denounce the common school 
system cease to clamor against it, the gloom of despondency 
will be dispelled, and all move on harmoniously in the accom- 
plishment of the grand object that the best of our people 
have in view. 
Iam eminently pleased with the knowledge that the most 
of our teachers in the county of Warren have done efficient 
work, and amply earned the paltry sum commonly tendered 
them. ‘ : 
- IT can conceive of no success in intellectual and moral cul- 
ture except through the advancement of our teachers, and 
the sooner the impeding idea that any novice in the profes. 
sion is competent to instruct the rising intelligence of the 
community is dispelled, the better will it be for our schools 
and our school interest. Experience teaches us that all who 
are consuming the pupils’ time and money in the school-room 
are not born to the profession, and that the curriculum should 
be steadily advanced until only the professional will be per- 
mitted to instruct. 
5. T. O'NEAL, 
WASHINGTON. 
The public schools of this county, taken as a class, have 
made more uniform progress during the scholastic year just 
closed than any other. previous year since the present law 
was enacted. 
Certain schools, such as were graded, may have in other 
years continued longer, and during such sessions perhaps 
aroused public sentiment more in favor of public schools; but 
the sentiment aroused was of a shorter kind than that which 
has now developed itself into a constant sort of enthusiasm. 
The public schools are no longer an experiment in this 
county. They have their ardent supporters in every district 
of the county. Almost all educators now concede them to 
he both the cheapest and the best schools in our midst. They 
have only to refer to the figures and facts i in this report to 
verify the assertion.
-P-A-G-E-98
93 
Many of the school houses of the county are not as com- 
fortable, neat and convenient as they should be; still some of 
them have been repaired partly at public and partly at private 
expense. In some localities new school houses have been 
built; and they ave a credit to such localities wherever they 
stand. , 
Financially, 1 emphasize the fact, out of dedi’ Nota dis- 
_ trict in the county is in debt. But a balance of $4,356.61, in 
the hands of the County Trustee, is ready for the opening 
schools of the coming year. A cash account is kept with 
each district as to receipts and expenditures by the County 
Trustee. Also, each school warrant is audited by me ina 
book for that purpose, giving the date: of the warrant and 
the amount of same before the warrant is paid; so that there 
is a duplicate record of the finances of the school fund kept, 
and at any time the precise amount on hand can be reported 
to any one desiring the information. 
The standard of teaching has been elevated; the kind of 
teaching, I mean method, has been looked after, and none 
but such teachers as keep abreast of the demands of the 
times are emploved by the directors to teach the public 
schools. 
Two county teachers’ institutes were held by me during 
the year. There was a good attendance at both of these. 
The last one of these was held at the county seat, for five 
days, during which time I conducted a written examination 
of the teachers, and from the papers on the various branches, 
drew their certificates of qualification to teach. I also held 
various other institutes in the county, called “Local Teachers’ 
Institutes.” These did much good in awakening the school 
interest in the communities in which they were held, besides 
practically improving the teachers who came fresh from 
their schools and engaged in these institutes. 
As can be seen from this report, Washington County is one 
among the few, to her credit and historical name, that pays a 
school tax of 30 cgnts on the $100 worth of property. The 
tax-payers look ugén the school tax as the best fax. Wash- 
ington County gétizens believe public schools are the best 
and the cheapg$t schools in the land.

I herewith send you my report for the scholastic year end-
-P-A-G-E-99
99 
ing June 30, 1882, and I admit that it is not as full as it ought 
to be, but as complete as I am able to make it. 
Thave observed no change necessary to be reported, only 
that I have endeavored to get our County Court to lay off 
our county regularly into schoo) districts, regardless of civil 
district lines, but the court has so far failed to do so, There 
isa good deal of dissatisfaction in the civil or justices’ dis- 
tricts, which are our school districts, about the location of 
school houses and the asstenment of scholars to certain 
houses, and in many instances it is hard to retain directors, 
and for these reasons I thought best that the County Court 
lay of the county icgularly into school districts, with one 
school in the centre of each district, as contemplated by the 
law. 
Our schools for the present year are progressing finely in | 
most-instances. 1 have been allowed no salary for may vsed 
vices, as you see per report, but have endeavored todischarge 
the duties of the office.

In compliance with the public school law, 1 present here- 
with my first annual report. I regret that I have not been 
able to make it sooner, but on account of the failure of the; 
County Trustee to report the financial condition of the 
schools of the county, I have failed to do so; and even now 
my report is not in every respect correct. Since the repeal 
of the law making it necessary for the County Superinten- 
dent to approve warrants before they are paid by the Trustee, 
it is utterly impossible to get the reports from teachers as re- 
quired by law. 
Since my election, in April, 1882, I have endeavored to 
impress directors with the importance of employing good 
- teachers and paying them according to their qualifications. 
One great fault in our county has been the disposition upon 
the part of many te employ teachers upon principles of 
economy vather than upon the merits of qualification. Tam 
glad to be able to state that this old fogy idea is disappearing, 
and a healthy, progressive spirit is suggesting the wisdom of 
employing good teachers and paying them a salary commen- 
surate with their qualifications. We age not without chronic 
grumblers in our county. There are a few men among us, 
LIBRARY MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE COLLEUi

-P-A-G-E-100
100 
even at this age of enlightenment, that think a teacher's 
salary should be no more than that of the man who works on 
the farm. This class of men also oppose public schools, be- 
cause “it is unjust to tax one man to educate another man’s 
children.” We have fewer of these men than formerly. I 
think that one of the principal dad features of our school 
law is the low grade of qualification required. Elementary 
Algebra, at least, should be added to our curriculum of public 
school study. A third grade certificate is a farce. 
We have no regular time for beginning our public schools. 
Our county has a variety of soil. In the southern part the 
principal product of the farmer is cotton, and in that section 
the schools usually begin in July or August, while in the 
northern part the product is tobacco, and consequently the 
pape schools rarely ever begin sooner than October or

WILSON. 
I, this day, enclose you my report for the scholastic year 
ending June 30, 1882. I know that Iam a little tardy, but I 
determined to make an accurate report, and I have succeeded. 
From my report you can see that the public schools of the 
county are by far in a more prosperous condition than at any 
former period. The schools have increased in numbers. The 
attendance is more than twice as great as it was last year. 
We have a much better corps of teachers than ever before. 
My people are beginning to regard the public school system 
as a fixture. When first elected to the office of County 
Superintendent I determined to make the system more popu- 
jar with those who have the taxes to pay, and in order to 
accomplish this end, I have made it a uniform rule, to which 
Thave adhered unflinchingly, never to issue certificates to 
applicants except on stated days, during an eight hours’ ex- 
amination, in the presence of as large a concourse of people 
“as could be induced tg attend. On all of these occasions, at 
the various prominent points throughout the county, I have
-P-A-G-E-101
101 
delivered addresses to the people explaining especially the 
nature of the school system—showing that it is Constitu- 
tional, and taxation for schools would continue regardless of 
the action of County Courts, and it being provided for in the 
Constifiition it was impossible for the people to avoid the 
payment of a school tax until there was a change in the 
Constitution, and as the system was meeting the approbation 
of the greater portion of the people they could not hope for 
any Constitutional change, and as the tax levied by the State 
was inadequate to accomplish any permanent. and lasting 
good, it behooved them to supplement the State’s levy, and 
thus build up the system. My suggestions have been adopted 
through the County Courts, and we now have over $18,000. 
All murmurings against public schools have ceased. Promi- 
nent tax-payers tell me that they will cheerfully submit to an 
additional levy of 25 cents rather than see the progress of 
the schools retarded.’ By examining my report you will see 
that I report only ten teachers to whom were granted first 
grade certificates... 1 will say, however, in justice to the 
‘teachers of my county, that were I to grade them as the 
teachers of adjoining counties are graded, nearly all of them 
would, have secured first grade certificates. I have been 
forced to reject quite a number of applicants who had with. 
them first grade certificates from other County Superinten- 
dents. The rigidity of these public examinations has ‘de- 
terred many who were incompetent, and others who might 
desire to teach just a session to get means to do something 
else, from making application, besides they demonstrate to 
the people that the time has passed away when “just any- 
body can teach in the public schools.” These examinations 
were exclusively to test the applicant’s ability to teach, but to 
give him the benefit of the means and methods that the 
examiners themselves used. I had associated with me in 
conducting these examinations, the most experienced and 
competent teacher in my county, Prof. W. J. Grannis, and 
also Prof. J. B. Warren, a young man of remarkable teach- 
ing capacity. The hearty co-operation of these gentlemen 
with me has done much to create a permanent and healthy 
sentiment in favor of free schools and liberal education. In 
visiting the schools of the county I have made it a point to 
have as many of the patrons of the schools to meet me at 
the school houses as possible, and by bringing (patrons and 
teachers together and talking of their necessities, T have
-P-A-G-E-102
102 
been able to have school houses repaired, seated, and in every 
way made comfortable at private expense. 
I think our school law should be changed in some particu- 
lars. County Superintendents should be made to approve or 
audit claims before they are paid by the Trustee. This would 
prevent the unscrupulous agent of school-room supplies from 
palming off his goods on unsuspecting directors at such 
enormous and exhorbitant prices. The passage of a statute 
empowering County Superintendents to expend as much as 
6 or 8 per cent. of the school fund of their county in defray- 
ing the expenses of county normal schools would be of in- 
calculable benefit to the schools of ‘Tennessee. Most of our 
teachers are wholly untrained, undisciplined, know but little, 
or comparatively nothing, of the present improved methods 
of teaching. It will not do to say that the normal can supply 
the public demand, for there are over six and nearly seven 
thousand public school teachers needed in the State, and we 
can safely say that not more than one-fourth of these are 
professional teachers, and the others are merely using the 
vocation as a stepping-stone to something else. These 
county normal schools could be held at the county seat of the’ 
county, at a time when they would not interfere with the 
public schools, and being free to all desiring to teach, the 
County Superintendent could require every applicant to-at- 
tend, making it prerequisite to the obtaining of a certificate. 
There is nothing, either in morals or religion, truer than the 
adage, “as the teacher is, so is the school.” Make the foun- 
tain pure and the stream will be pure; make the teachers 
competent and dur schools will be excellent.

SUMMARIES OF SCHOLASTIC YEAR 
ENDING JUNE 30, 1882.   
The summaries here submitted are for eighty-two counties. — 
The Superintendents of the counties of Cheatham, Clai- 
borne, Crockett, Hawkins, Henderson, Marion, Obion, 
Sevier, White and Williamson have failed to report. Since 
a part of this report has been in type I have received reports 
from the Superintendents of the counties of Gibson, Moore 
and Robertson. This unusual lateness on their part is the 
result of weakness in the school law. If teachers and trus- 
tees refuse to report to the County Superintendents, they 
have no way to compel them to report. Where the tables 
are filled for these counties they are from the reports of 1881.

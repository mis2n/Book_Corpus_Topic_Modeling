  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
The remarkable growth of the American high school, 
which has been one of the most outstanding features of 
the educational history of the twentieth century, has 
carried with it the necessity for the reconsideration of 
nearly all of the fundamental problems of the American 
school. Not only has this great growth made critical the 
problems of financing education; it has also stimulated 
greatly the progress of the reorganization of the public 
school system. The rapid growth, for instance, of the 
junior high school or intermediate school has been made 
possible in many communities not through the conviction 
of the taxpayers, the board of education, or even the 
superintendent that through this new division improve- 
ment in curriculum will result, but because it seemed to 
offer frequently a tangible method of securing better 
administrative conditions than would be possible either 
through the erection of additional high schools or ele- 
mentary schools without any such reorganization. On 
the other hand the comparative ease with which such 
radical reorganizations could at least be commenced in 
many communities made possible the consideration of 
advisable reorganizations, rearrangements, omissions and 
additions to the curriculum. 
The fact that we now have in a large number of the 
public school systems of the United States numerous 
junior high schools located in their own buildings, 
manned by teachers often prepared for other types of

  vi EDITORS INTRODUCTION 
work and unsympathetic with the new administrative 
unit, brings about a situation which, while at first some- 
what discouraging, seems in reality to be productive of 
genuine educational progress. The past differences in 
the concepts as to the types of changes desirable, the 
presence in all of our communities and school faculties 
of individuals, perhaps critical in their attitude towards 
these newer things, makes far. more probable the con- 
tinuance of a state of flux until out of it there shall be 
developed a system more standardized but at the same 
time based upon a thoroughly scientific study of the 
curriculum. 
This desirable outcome will not, however, be secured 
unless at the same time America’s most distinctive and 
fundamental institution, the American elementary 
school, shall have been reconstituted in the light of 
present conditions and future problems. It is with the 
hope that there may in this study of the elementary 
school be found suggestions of value to students of educa- 
tion that this volume is prepared. While there are 
available for the educational public many texts which 
deal with the elementary school in its various phases, 
this volume in a rather unique way presents the problem 
from the standpoint of public education as a whole. 
While not all may agree with the author’s conclusions as 
to the origin and the place of the American elementary 
school, his treatment, even of topics which may be 
honestly questioned, is such as to stimulate thought and 
cannot but develop an attitude towards the problem 
which it is highly desirable for all young people who are 
preparing for educational work to secure. It is certainly 
fitting that at a time when nearly all are discussing the 
question as to the desirability of the six-year term of
-P-A-G-E-7

the elementary school conclusions should be based upon 
carefully considered presentations of the field and scope 
of public education. This the author has succeeded in 
doing and brings together the consensus of opinion in a 
way which will be of value to our students of education 
in teacher-training institutions. There is no doubt that 
the drift of educational thought is towards greater 
participation by the state in the actual control of educa- 
tion. Some of the arguments used by the author of this 
text in supporting this idea may seem to many very 
advanced. It is always a question in the consideration 
of educational problems as to how far one is justified 
in presenting ideas which have not general acceptance. 
In view of the fact that so many real advantages can be 
shown to come from greater state control, the considera- 
tion of even extreme forms of this sort is suggestive and 
possibly may have an influence in securing what it is 
the aim of the author to try to bring about—a really 
greater equality of educational opportunity. 
In the treatment of the various problems of organiza- 
tion, including the status of principal and teacher and 
the various problems which have to do with the pupil 
community, there has been the greatest pains to present 
examples of the most effective kind of instruction found 
in America. The volume as a whole is submitted to 
the educational public in the belief that it will meet 
several very real needs. There is a real place for courses 
of instruction centering around the elementary school 
which, as yet, has not been met effectively in our colleges 
of education. In our normal schools and more strictly 
teacher-training institutions this book should be found 
to have great value as a fundamental text. It is also 
prepared in such a way that it can be read to advantage

have not thought through the problems of the elemen- 
tary school may find in this book a very real mine of

PREFACE 
Tur normal school student who has been introduced 
to her future profession from the many points of view 
of the teacher-training curriculum, requires a summar- 
izing of her observation, practice-teaching, reading, and 
discussion. The experienced teacher engaged in the daily 
task of carrying on her share of the great responsibility 
of education is interested in a broader and more gen- 
eral view of the field than her everyday work, experience, 
and contact may, perchance, afford. The college student 
who is looking forward to public education as a pro- 
fession must be introduced to the field of his future 
work within the limits of the scant time that may be 
spared in the crowded curriculum. 
It is with a view to meeting these requirements that 
this book has been prepared. Every paragraph and 
every sentence—indeed, almost every word—has taken 
form in the process of presenting the field of public edu- 
cation to college seniors and juniors, and assisting them, 
as effectively as may be, to broad conceptions of the 
significance, organization, aims, and goals of publicly 
supported elementary schools in the United States. 
In so far as the pages that follow have any merit, the 
writer feels only too keenly, and gladly acknowledges, his 
debt to all the thinkers on current educational problems 
-—a debt that must be apparent on every page. Only 
occasionally, however, has specific reference to sources 
been made in the footnotes. But it would be ungracious

of him not to mention specifically his indebtedness to 
the members of the departments of education of the 
University of California and of Stanford University, and 
particularly to his friend and counsellor, Dean Elwood 
P. Cubberley of the last-named institution. For the 
reading of the manuscript, and suggestions generously 
made from out of his rich experience, the writer grate- 
fully acknowledges his debt to Dr. C. E. Chadsey, Dean 
of the College of Education of the University of Illinois. 
Responsibility in full for inaccuracies and opinions ex- 
pressed belongs exclusively to the author. 
I am indebted to my colleague, Professor Lucy Lock- 
wood Hazard, of the department of English at Mills Col- 
lege, for generous assistance; she read this volume in 
proof and made valuable suggestions with regard to form. 
It will be noted that the bibliography given at the end 
of the chapters is obviously not exhaustive. It has not 
been the writer’s object to refer to original sources, but 
rather to assist the student in finding easily the available 
material that might be used in elaborating those topics 
under discussion in which he may be particularly inter- 
ested. Taken all together, the books referred to form a 
modest library readily obtainable, without which as a 
minimum no college instructor would undertake to use 
this book as the basis of his work in elementary edu- 
cation. 
The questions found at the end of the chapters are 
not intended to serve the purpose of determining whether 
the student has faithfully done his work, or even whether 
he has comprehended it. These topics are deliberately 
designed to serve as incentives for the development of 
phases either inadequately or not at all covered in the 
chapter which they follow. As such, they form an in-

tegral part of the text, deliberately intended to assist in 
varying the courses of reading and discussion for which 
the text may be used as a basis. The proper use of these 
topics should enable individual groups and instructors to 
reproportion the work in elementary education, develop- 
ing those phases that interest them most, and giving 
minimum attention to. topics that interest them least. 
No two groups using the topics as well as the text will 
do the work in the same manner.

  THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL 
CHAPTER I 
THE FIELD OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 
Public education a social instrumentality—Public 
education in the United States is a functioning social in- 
stitution. It has a history, traditions, policies, habits, and 
methods. Like most social institutions, it is not neces- 
sarily conscious of itself as a mechanism. Like all living 
social institutions, it would continue to function were 
books about it never to be written, were it never to be 
subjected to analysis and discussion. 
As is the case with all really living institutions, these 
traditions, goals, methods, and policies are continually 
changing, and in the course of these changes there have 
been accumulated certain now useless, but at one time 
useful, characteristics. Many of the participants in 
public education are not themselves in any true sense 
conscious of the institution as a whole. They perform 
their function and take their place as instrumentalities in 
the institution without troubling themselves to secure a 
broad view of its significance and its scope. 
But public education in the United States is an insti- 
tution that expends annually vast funds; that deliber- 
ately engages many years of the lives of millions of chil- 
3

4 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
  dren; that assumes a definite responsibility for the train- 
ing of the generations; and it is the business of such an 
institution to be conscious of its function, to examine 
its methods and goals, to test their efficacy, and in every 
possible way to improve its procedure. 
Especially is it the business of the teacher who would 
earn the right to professional status, who would function 
consciously as an educator, who would give an account of 
his stewardship, who would honestly and earnestly bear 
the responsibility of an expert to whom children may be 
entrusted, deliberately to examine the institution of which 
he is a part, and which he in turn takes a share in 
directing. 
The significance of education—What is education? 
The theory that education is learning, and is equivalent 
to an accumulation of knowledge, has been frequently 
and correctly challenged. For the now sufficiently es- 
tablished reason that only such knowledge as functions is 
education, mere knowledge may be useless either because 
the content itself is of no avail to the individual under 
any conditions or, where the knowledge might be useful, 
because it has not, as far as the particular individual is 
concerned, been related to its own form of doing; in 
other words, has not been transformed as conduct. 
Neither can one say that education is something that is 
acquired or attained by going to school; for the assump- 
tion that education is a goal arrived at only by institu- 
tional means is also obviously faulty. If education means 
living, changing, developing, adapting, growing, the 
processs may well go on without formal schooling, as it 
always has and always will go on. Education antedates 
schooling, both for the social group, since there was edu-
-P-A-G-E-21
THE FIELD OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 5 
  cation before there were schools, and for the individual, 
since his education goes on for many years before he 
presents himself to the school institution. 
Education may be viewed from many angles. From 
the point of view of the individual to be educated, it 
“may be tentatively defined as the process by means of 
which the individual acquires experiences that will 
function in rendering more efficient his future action.” + 
From the point of view of the formal educating means, 
education “is the influence exerted by the school, tech- 
nically so called, upon the individual.” 2 From the point 
of view of the good of the community of which the in- 
dividual is a member, particularly in primitive com- 
munities, “the deepest aim of this education is, of course, 
the perpetuation of the group. In this regard the 
individual does not count. What he may want or desire 
is not considered; the life of the group is the only im- 
portant fact, even for the individual.’* “The task of 
education,” says Professor Thorndike, “is to make changes 
in human beings.” ¢ 
Education as a practical problem.—There is available 
a large and interesting literature on the theoretical sig- 
nificance and meaning of education. To the teacher and 
practical educator, however, education presents itself in 
the form of a problem. Phrased in its most obvious 
terms as it must be faced every day, this problem is: 
What shall the school institution do for and with the

millions of children who come to it with the utmost 
confidence in its ability? How best shall it use the time 
of these children; how expend the funds, and employ the 
equipment available; how serve every individual interest 
and the interests of the community at large. 
Three factors involved in the problem of education. 
—In the narrower sense of formal schooling as one phase 
of the general education of the individual, the problem as 
thus faced daily by the teacher in its pragmatic rather 
than its theoretical form, consists of three primary fac- 
tors: the child, the community, and the means or school 
institution. An attempt to solve the problem of educa- 
tion without reducing it to ever smaller and more con- 
crete questions leaves the thinker permanently in the 
realm of speculation. It is only by constant subdivision of 
the difficult questions into their many phases that definite 
and concrete conclusions can be arrived at. A study of 
the general problem which has been stated must be at- 
tempted by means of constant subdivision until the 
particular point is reached in any phase of the question 
that can be finally handled. 
The child as a factor.—The child is an unstable factor 
in the problem of education. Children vary physically 
as well as mentally. Even in a historic and social 
sense this factor is unstable, for childhood may be a 
longer or a shorter period depending on time and history, 
or on the community in which the child lives. As a period 
of preparation, the duration of infancy is a variable 
period, since it takes longer to prepare to participate in a 
highly complex society than in a primitive community, 
in which the experience necessary may be easily acquired 
by association with the parents.
-P-A-G-E-23
  
  THE FIELD OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 7 
It has been pointed out that human infancy has become 
ever longer with the evolution of society toward increas- 
ing complexity, but the school must bear in mind that 
both of the factors of infancy, i.e. dependence and 
plasticity, have biological and physiological limitations. 
- Regardless of the increasing complexity of life and the 
consequent desirability of lengthening the period of train- 
ing, there are fixed limits. Infancy cannot be indefinitely 
extended. The increasing complexity of human insti- 
tutions necessitating an ever greater amount of train- 
ing on the part of the future participants may go on, 
but the duration of human life remains approximately 
the same, and the point of anatomical and mental 
maturation remains at approximately the same age. So 
long as human life was so little organized that children 
might readily become participants at puberty or prior 
thereto, there were years left to the child that might be 
used for additional training. But when this process of 
training reaches the point where it frequently requires 
one-third of human life, and endures well beyond the 
point at which the individual is fully formed and matured, 
the problem becomes one of using a minimum of time 
with a maximum of efficiency. 
The community as a factor—The character of the 
community itself is also a factor making for instability in 
the problem of education; education cannot mean the 
same thing in different communities, or in the same com- 
munity at different times. How significant the education 
of youth is to the community may be seen from the 
rapidity with which societies adopting new economic or 
political ideas attack the problem of public education. 
Almost before they faced their great political and eco-
-P-A-G-E-24
  8 . THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
nomic questions, the new republics of Russia and Ger- 
many began remodeling their educational systems. Edu- 
cational ideals and methods well adjusted to the needs of 
an empire were found no longer, suitable for the new 
order. Similarly, it has become ever more clear that the 
factor of democracy is in America so vital that it is trans-* 
forming not only traditional curriculum content, but tra- 
ditional procedure and teaching method as well. 
Education is not and cannot be always and everywhere 
the same; it must adapt itself to conditions. 
The school institution as a factor.—The school insti- 
tution itself in meeting these variable and changing fac- 
tors must be a constantly changing organism; as it revises 
its goals, as it learns more of the child, as it changes with 
the community, it must ever change the concept of its 
function and alter its methods. There is,no room in edu- 
cation for the attitude of complacency. 
Education and the teacher.—The teacher, as educator, 
is called to a vocation that gives the very greatest scope 
for active participation in the most important problem 
that any community ever faces. In order conscientiously 
to carry out the great trust that society reposes in him, 
the trust of specialized nurture, the teacher has an op- 
portunity for the expression of every fine and noble im- 
pulse in a degree that almost no other vocation provides. 
What is education? To the actual practitioner, educa- 
tion is a problem that may be subdivided into many 
subordinate problems, all of which, in contrast with 
problems in the field of the natural sciences, deal with fac- 
tors that in their very nature are unstable. The impli- 
cation of this simple fact of the instability of the main 
factors of the problem, is that final answers and solutions
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE FIELD OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 9 
are not to be arrived at in this field. There are no certain 
and inevitable answers to be found to the great questions 
of education. The discussions in this field must ever lead 
toward, but not to solution. While facts and laws may 
be established within specific subdivisions of the field, 
the final answers, themselves, will never become scientific 
laws such as physics and chemistry furnish. The teacher 
cannot be supplied with a series of rules of thumb that 
will work, with a key that will always unlock, with a 
solution previously made to meet difficulties that may 
thereafter occur. 
The reasons for this lack of finality in the field of 
education are patent enough. They operate also in other 
fields of like inquiry, which deal with human beings in 
their social relations and institutions, as for example 
political science and economics. What then is the busi- 
ness of the teacher who would be prepared for his work, 
if his equipment is not to consist ultimately in a mastery 
of fixed and never-failing laws? 
Briefly stated, this equipment should ultimately con- 
sist of an ability to take an intelligent and useful part 
in the discussion of the problems of education. The self- 
activity that accompanies the training in education 
should consist of participation in the discussion of its 
problems. For, ultimately, expertness in education means 
ability to participate in the solution of unsolved prob- 
lems rather than knowledge of laws and procedure. 
It may well be asked here whether there is room for 
the claim that modern education is an organized field of 
inquiry; whether it is not, after all, every one’s field; 
whether the opinion of one is not as good as that of 
another. The answer to these questions must be negative.
-P-A-G-E-26
10 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
The doing away with subjectivity and mere opinion is of 
the very essence of the modern scientific method in educa- 
tion. 
Only in so far as it ceases to be true that the opinion 
of one is as good as that of another, does education 
become a technical field. The prospective participant 
in a discussion of the problems of education must 
be versed in the basic sciences of biology and psy- 
chology; he must have some conception of history as 
well as sociology and political science; he must further 
become acquainted with the specific history of public 
education from which he may learn what the accumulated 
experience of the profession has taught, what problems 
have been solved in the past; finally he must become 
master of the current objective procedure based on 
statistical method, which has become so great an instru- 
ment in the contemporary discussion and solution of con- 
crete and definite subdivisions of the larger problem. 
Although the answer to the problem—what is educa- 
tion?—-can in the nature of things never be formulated in 
the form of ultimate laws, mere opinion and disregard of 
facts experimentally determined, must constantly give 
place to an increasing number of objective standards, and 
the ability to approach problems in a temper and mood 
that are objective and scientific in character. The at- 
tainment of a maximum of objectivity in the discussion 
of problems is the most marked tendency of current edu- 
cational procedure. 
ee, Summary 
The object of this chapter has been to make clear to 
the reader: 
1. That the field of public education is a functioning

institution, which presents great problems whose solution 
can never be: ultimate and final. ’ 
2. That there are three main factors involved, the child, 
the community, and the school institution, each of which 
is in the nature of things not fixed, but subject to change. 
3. That while finalities and fixed laws in this field, as 
in other social sciences, are neither possible nor desirable, 
this does not preclude the methods and procedure of 
science. 
  Problems 
The preceding chapter deliberately omits theoretical 
discussion of the meaning of education, viewing the scope 
of the book as a direct practical attack. A discussion of 
the general philosophy of education may be undertaken on 
the basis of the literature of that subject, reference to 
which is in part made below.

  CHAPTER IT 
THE SCOPE OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 
Present general characteristics of the school.—The 
American public elementary school is a functioning insti- 
tution. Its characteristics are definitely marked and deep- 
rooted in the history of American education. Among the 
most obvious of these characteristics are the following: 
(1) It is the elementary school which establishes first 
contact with the child so far as his formal school educa- 
tion is concerned. The kindergarten, which in many well- 
organized school systems precedes the first grade, does not 
regard itself as a part of the formal school. Its function 
appears rather to be a better and more systematic ac- 
complishment of that part of the child’s pre-school train- 
ing which is ordinarily left to the home. The kinder- 
garten functionally replaces the family rather than the 
school. 
(2) The typical American elementary school is a non- 
specialized institution, offering the same type of training 
to all throughout the period of their attendance. It is 
a single-curriculum school. 
(3) The American elementary school is an eight-year 
school, each year corresponding to one grade. Typically 
it undertakes thé training of the child from age six to 
age fourteen. 
(4) It is a fundamental characteristic of the American 
13

14 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
  elementary school that it seems to assume that it is 
providing the only education that its children are to 
receive. While it is impossible for it to be unaware of the 
fact that numbers of its graduates are to go on with their 
education and to attend secondary schools, it is by tradi- 
tion, and, indeed, by theory, bent upon giving a sense of 
completion in order to equip for life as well as possible 
those of its students who may end their formal school- 
ing with the completion of the eighth grade. It conducts 
graduation exercises; it grants diplomas; and, as a matter 
of fact, it was, until thirty-five or forty years ago when 
the high-school development began, the only school at- 
tended by a large majority of the American people. 
(5) The pupil community of the usual elementary 
school is a psychologically non-homogeneous group, con- 
sisting as it does of a large group of students who are 
definitely pre-adolescent, and of a smaller group who have 
definitely entered the period of adolescence. 
(6) The American elementary school is a rudimentary 
and vernacular institution. It is typically confined to the 
one language, and limited to rudimentary and elementary 
subjects. It does not have the means of introducing the 
beginnings of the so-called secondary-school subjects 
even if it would do so, the teaching body being, on the 
whole, unprepared for such work. 
(7) Finally, the American elementary school is char- 
acterized by the fact that its teaching staff is com- 
posed almost entirely of a special teacher-group. Its 
trained teachers are graduates of institutions whose func- 
tion is limited to the preparation of prospective elemen- 
tary-school teachers. These persons are ordinarily not 
qualified to rise in the educational ladder and assume
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE SCOPE OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 15 
secondary-school positions, or to make fundamental 
changes in the Saye curriculum by adding 
advanced subjects. 
We have in America a douiie system of teacher train- 
ing normal schools for the elementary-school teachers, 
and college for the high-school teachers, which has given 
a certain rigid fixity to our schools and kept them as un- 
fused, separate institutions. 
Objections made to the elementary school as now 
organized.—The elementary school as now existing is 
being subjected to a series of indictments ever increasing 
in intensity, and the charges that are brought against it 
must be given consideration. Circumstances must be 
examined, and the faults actually found must be eradi- 
cated. Instead of pursuing by virtue of mere momentum 
fixed traditions, methods, and characteristics, many of 
which are traceable to historic accident rather than to 
definite, formulated theory, the elementary school must 
settle down to a conscious inquiry as to its own function, 
its objectives, and the means of attaining these objectives. 
Among the charges being made against the efficiency of 
the elementary school, some of the most serious are the 
following: 
(1) There is no theoretical ground for the number of 
years that a child is kept in the elementary school. 
Since the school has greatly improved its methods of 
teaching those fundamentals which are the principal ob- 
ject of its existence, this gain should be shown in a cor- 
responding decrease in the length of time required to 
master them. 
(2) The fact of taking too long to do this work is ac- 
tually militating against the public welfare, in that num-
-P-A-G-E-32
  16 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
bers of elementary-school pupils become weary of the 
repetition in the upper grades of work heretofore com- 
pleted, and drop out of school. These children ought to 
have been interested earlier in new fields and kept for 
longer and more thorough preparation. 
(3) The period in a child’s life at which he is dismissed 
from the elementary school is a poor time for him to make 
the change to the secondary school. It is the beginning 
of the restless adolescent period. It would be better for 
the welfare of the child were he by the time this period is 
reached definitely established in a secondary school, and 
looking forward to some years of work prior to a break 
between schools or completion of one of the links in the 
chain of schools. 
(4) Age fourteen is too late a period for the beginning 
of differentiation. There is some optimum period when 
the common curriculum for all ceases to be of value, when 
specialization and differentiated education should begin 
on the basis of variation in intelligence, in interests, in 
econdmic prospects, or on one of many other bases. It is 
wasteful to defer this point of specialization to so late an 
age as fourteen. 
(5) The school’s tendency toward finality, its under- 
current of assumption that for many children it is the 
only school that they will ever attend, is necessarily the 
cause of a great deal of overlapping between it and the 
high school. On this theory much work is done in the 
elementary.school that might well be left to the secondary 
school. This underlying assumption of finality is also 
contrary to the growing feeling that eight years is too 
short a period for compulsory education. In view of the 
ever-mounting age up to which the state compels school
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE SCOPE OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 17 
attendance, it would be well for the elementary school 
to assume exactly the opposite tendency to that now 
motivating it. It should be considered quite definitely as 
an incomplete school—one phase in the process of the 
child’s education. 
Summed up, these charges all tend toward the single 
demand for a shorter elementary-school period which 
shall (1) consume only the time necessary for the com- 
pletion of fixed tasks, thus helping to hold more children 
for higher education; (2) conform to the facts of psy- 
chological development by. making the change from 
school to school at a more propitious period and begin 
differentiation and individualization of the educational 
process at the correct developmental point; and (3), 
finally, by sending children out before the expiration of 
the compulsory-age period, deliberately proclaim itself a 
first and preparatory phase of education for all and not as 
at present, a unit complete in itself for many. 
Historical basis of present practice.—The present 
character of the elementary school and the value of the 
criticism directed against it may be made to stand out 
more clearly if looked at in the light of its historic 
background. 
We in America do not have a homogeneous, care- 
fully planned, system of public schools. We have two 
systems: an elementary-school system, and a-secondary- 
school system. These systems were not instituted and 
deliberately devised to complement one another, to articu- 
late, to lead naturally from one to the other. They have 
different historic roots. The elementary school is said 
by some students to have been modeled on the common 
schools of Prussia, where one finds a system of education

for the masses as opposed to a small group of the popula- 
tion for whom other provisions are made. These schools 
wére intended to be and have always remained rudimen- 
tary and vgrnacular schools. They are intended to lead 
_ not to higher education but to confirmation and appren- 
ticeship. They are intended to be complete in themselves, 
and to prepare for life. The “Volksschule” provides all 
the education received by ninety-seven per cent. of the 
population of the German Empire. This school does not 
lead to the “Gymnasium” or to the university. Its gradu- 
ates are neither prepared nor eligible for admission to 
higher schools unless it be the trade schools which have 
to a large extent replaced the apprenticeship system. 
At the time when the American elementary school was 
established, it represented a great advance in public edu- 
cation. We did not have nearly so efficient an educating ~ 
medium. The appealing and outstanding characteristic 
of this school at that time was not the fact that it was 
rudimentary and vernacular, but rather the fact that it 
was a government-controlled, free, popular, tax-supported 
school for the children of all. 
At the time that this school was established, free sec- 
ondary education for as many of the children of the 
community as could avail themselves of it, was un- 
dreamed of. This idea has in fact just established it- 
self in our own generation. The old Latin grammar 
school was an aristocratic institution engaged in prepar- 
ing a very few to enter college. When the demand for 
more education arose, for a longer period and additional 
subjects, we were not in a position to remodel the ele- 
mentary school for reasons of untrained teaching per- 
sonnel to be’noted in more detail below. Instead, we
-P-A-G-E-35

superimposed on this institution the secondary school— 
superimposed at age fourteen a school which abroad re- 
ceived children at nine. We did not shorten the elemen- 
tary school. We advanced the age of admi#sion to the. 
secondary school. ; , 
Meanwhile, although it has been becoming ever more 
evident for the last twenty-five or thirty years that the 
~ secondary school in America is to become a definite part 
of the education of all the children, the elementary 
school has remained an eight-year school. If those 
students are right who trace the origin of our elementary 
school to Prussian influences, then it would seem that 
because in Prussia a century or more ago it was decided 
that the children of the masses should not be apprenticed 
to a trade prior to approximately age fourteen, that be- 
ing about the age that children were confirmed or ad- 
mitted to their first communion, not because it has ever 
been theoretically determined that eight years is the 
proper length of time for the first phase of education, we 
in America maintain an eight-year school: because in 
Prussia a century or more ago it was not considered neces- 
sary to give the children of the masses the opportunity 
to acquire a knowledge of foreign languages or of higher 
mathematics, or of any other of the so-called secondary 
subjects, we in America to-day continue to maintain our 
elementary school on a rudimentary and vernacular 
basis; because puberty among primitive peoples coincided 
with the end of childhood and the beginning of adult- 
hood, we in America to-day maintain eight-year schools. 
This defect becomes more glaring when we consider 
that in Prussia, cruel though the basis of selection was, 
the children intended for higher education began their 
   
-P-A-G-E-36
  20 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
secondary studies in the ninth year; while here, where 
it is hoped that all children capable of it may follow 
secondary studies, none of them are ordinarily permitted 
to begin their work prior to age fourteen. 
One of the most potent factors tending to hold the 
American school system and its divisions in a grip of 
rigid immutability, has been our double system of teacher 
training. In their efforts to recruit teaching forces for 
the elementary schools, the early schoolmen established 
training schools—our normal schools—institutions where 
training was given in methods; where just enough was 
taught to provide for the immediate need of securing 
teachers for the schools. On the other hand, teachers for 
the secondary schools have naturally been recruited from 
the colleges; and so the double system took root. A 
vicious circle was established. The normal school, 
originally a most useful institution, has by the very fact 
of its growth and development, at the same time that it 
has always limited its functions to the training of ele- 
mentary-school teachers, fastened the rudimentary in- 
evitableness of the elementary school upon the American 
system; for the teachers trained for that school have 
ordinarily not been equipped to enrich its curriculum by 
the introduction of secondary-school subjects in the earlier 
years. 
“The American public-school system now stands, after 
three centuries of growth, complete in form only. Its 
three divisions—elementary, secondary, and that embrac- 
ing higher education—are joined together, end to end, 
forming a lineal whole”; . . . but “the whole which the 
fusing process of recent years has given us is complete 
in form only. In organic relation, in sharpness of
-P-A-G-E-37
THE SCOPE OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 21 
province, and in distinctiveness of function, these di- 
visions are not yet satisfactorily articulated.” 1 
“The practice of segregating children of the same age 
and of the same attainments into ‘grades’ or ‘years’ and 
grouping together the first eight to form the ele- 
mentary division had its beginning with us in the third 
and fourth decades of the nineteenth century. In its 
essential features the plan was borrowed from Germany, 
where . . . it had been evolved during three centuries 
of educational discussion and practice.” ! 
“An examination of the school codes of the German 
states will show that, in almost every case, the law pro- 
vided that the child should enter school in his sixth year 
and remain in attendance, if a Catholic, until time for 
his first communion, or, if evangelical in his church af- 
filiations, to the time of confirmation, the two rites 
usually occurring at the same age—namely, in the 
fourteenth year.” ? 
The proposed solution.—In view of the foregoing it 
must be clear that the time has come to examine on 
theoretical grounds, and with as little attention as pos- 
sible to historic and traditional legacies, the status and 
function of the elementary school. Why does this insti- 
tution exist? What precisely are the objectives which it 
is expected to attain? What are the means by which

-P-A-G-E-38
22 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
these objectives are to be attained? If its present organ- 
ization and methods are not well calculated to the attain- 
ment of these objectives, what are the changes necessary? 
Although it is clear that on a purely theoretical basis 
as little attention as possible should be given to estab- 
lished organization and method whose only reason for 
being is historical or traditional, the fact must, neverthe- 
less, be faced that the actual putting of theory into prac- 
tice’ must take place while the institution is continuing 
to function, and as far as possible with the means at hand. 
Were it considered necessary on a purely theoretical basis 
to establish in America the European system of the three- 
year rudimentary school and a nine-year secondary school, 
the actual existing facts would make such a reform im- 
possible. Teachers of secondary-school subjects would 
not be available in sufficient numbers. If we are to apply 
theory as rapidly as may be to the actual practice of 
existing schools, only such suggestions ought to be con- 
sidered as can be put into effect within a reasonable period 
of time, and with the means now at hand. 
It is agreed on all sides that the work which the ele- 
mentary school now does can be efficiently accomplished 
in six years. From that point of view the elementary 
school might be reduced to that length of time. Age 
twelve would seem an ideal point for making the change 
from uniform to differentiated education. American 
education must be fundamentally democratic. On the 
basis of our social outlook we must have a single system 
and expose all of our children to like treatment. Selec- 
tion for secondary education ought to be made on the 
basis of capacity alone. For this purpose it seems to be 
wise to hold children together for six. years. Age twelve
-P-A-G-E-39
THE SCOPE OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 23 
is not too late, and an earlier age might be too early to 
begin differentiation in the educative process on the basis 
of intelligence, interests, and special capacities. The first 
six years of the child’s life may well be devoted to the 
acquisition of those general skills that underlie and are 
common to all of the activities of modern civilization, 
skills which are necessary to the child regardless of his 
choice in the matter of further schooling. It is quite 
probable that for the average child this period is not too 
long atime. Furthermore, for this length of time we have 
a well equipped teaching body. 
That this is probably the consensus of opinion of 
American thinkers in education is evidenced by the fol- 
lowing suggestion quoted from the Commission on the 
Reorganization of Secondary Education, appointed by 
the National Education Association: “We, therefore, 
recommend a reorganization of the school system where- 
by the first six years shall be devoted to elementary 
education designed to- meet the needs of pupils of approx- 
imately six to twelve years of age.” ® 
Within this six-year period the work may well be left 
non-specialized and non-differentiated so far as concerns 
the curriculum. The object of the school may well be 
to give the child a “command of fundamental processes” 
as well as so much of the other objectives of education 
named by the Commission as are applicable to this age- 
group, namely: “health, worthy home membership, citi- 
zenship, worthy use of leisure, ethical character.” * Under 
this proposal, and particularly in view of the suggestion 
regarding over-age children to be noted later, vocational

  24 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
education is definitely barred from the elementary school. 
In addition to the advantages of the six-year period, the 
new elementary school takes on certain other character- 
istics as a result of the foregoing discussion which should 
be noted: 
(1) The new elementary school should be quite delib- 
erately incomplete from the point of view of the child’s 
education, in view of the constant tendency to lengthen 
the compulsory-school period, and in view of the deliber- 
ate shortening of the elementary-school period. It should 
be clear that the new elementary school is not complete 
in itself. It is merely the first phase of the child’s edu- 
cation, having as its principal object the preparation of 
the child for the next and more differentiated stage. All 
overlapping on the theory that the child will not go 
further may now be eradicated, and it should be made 
clear that as regards the vast mass of the population the 
elementary school does not provide a finished equipment. 
“An extended education for every boy and girl,” to 
quote further from the Commission, “is essential to the 
welfare and even to the existence of democratic society. 
. . . Education should be so reorganized that every 
normal boy and girl will be encouraged to remain in 
school to the age of eighteen on full time if possible, other- 
wise on part time.” 
In order to relieve the elementary school of the need 
of any differentiated work, and yet to provide for their 
type, the Commission quite abandons the traditional idea 
of the secondary school as a caste institution, and delib- 
erately takes the view of this school as an instrumentality 
for the training of youth, when it recommends: 
“That secondary schools admit and provide suitable
-P-A-G-E-41
THE SCOPE OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 25 
instruction for all pupils who are in any respect so mature 
that they would derive more benefit from the secondary 
school than from the elementary school.” 
(2) Another important characteristic of the new ele- 
mentary school is the homogeneity of its pupil group. 
The early adolescent is removed from this group. The 
over-age child who cannot master the work of the school 
in approximately six years is removed for the purpose of 
differentiation to the secondary school upon the recom- 
mendation of the Commission. From a psychological as 
well as from a social point of view, the group is more 
homogeneous, and therefore, easier to work with. It 
may be worth noting incidentally that the removal of 
the early adolescent and the over-age child simplifies the 
problem of discipline. 
Advantages of the six-year elementary school.—The 
new elementary school whose character and function is 
on theoretical grounds agreed upon by practically all 
American thinkers in education, has these characteristics 
and advantages: 
(1) It is the school which establishes the first contact 
with the child so far as concerns his formal education. 
(2) It is a school which, as far as curriculum objectives 
are concerned, is not specialized. It does not differentiate 
between children on the basis of general goals.® 
(3) It is a six-year school, whose definite aim is to pre- 
pare the child for his second period of training, a period 
to be characterized by differentiation. 
(4) It is a school which deals with a pupil group that 
is as homogeneous as can be arranged from the point of 
re a discussion of differentiation on other bases, see Chapter 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  26 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
view of maturity, but not from the point of view of na- 
tive endowment. In view of the non-specialized char- 
acter of its goals, and of the desirability of holding all 
children up to approximately age twelve, so that rate of 
progress cannot be used as a means of differentiation, the 
school faces the problem of adjusting itself to the differ- 
ences in native capacity.® 
(5) The school retains its purely elementary character. 
It is a rudimentary and vernacular school, giving the 
same opportunity to all the children of the community, 
and enabling every educable child to take advantage of 
the provision of secondary and higher education. 
More general by-product advantages involved in the 
proposed reorganization.—The proposed reorganization 
has three important advantages as regards the general 
organization of American schools that should not be 
overlooked: 
(1) By decreasing the number of years and by taking 
care of the demand for earlier specialization and differ- 
entiation in another school, the present teacher-training 
agencies will be automatically retained and made more 
useful than ever. This change need not disturb. the 
present method of normal-school training for elementary- 
school teachers. These training institutions will un- 
doubtedly continue improving their curricula and pro- 
cedure. No demand need be made on them to introduce 
secondary-school subjects.” 
°See Chapter XIV. 
"This situation would obviously assume a different aspect if these 
teacher-training agencies should, as seems not unlikely, enter the 
college and university field and claim as their own the entire business 
of teacher-training.
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE SCOPE OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 27 
(2) The removal from the elementary school of chil- 
dren between twelve and fourteen years of age will tend 
to strengthen the smaller high schools by increasing their 
attendance. It will automatically tend to improve the 
resources and character of these institutions; it will help 
in the consolidation and formation of high-school districts. 
(3) The small ungraded school of one and two teachers 
must inevitably continue in America for many years 
in spite of every effort toward consolidation. The 
removal of children from age twelve to fourteen from this 
school, making it a six- instead of an eight-grade school, 
will undoubtedly tend in the direction of simplifying this 
complicated problem and of improving the efficiency of 
this unit in Ameriean educational organization. 
Results demanded for time saved.—A fact which be- 
longs to the secondary rather than the elementary school 
field may be noted in passing. If the elementary school 
does its work as it can be done in six years rather than 
eight; if, as is evident on this reorganization, it releases 
two years of the life of the child, it will be incumbent’ 
upon the secondary school system to show what that 
system does with these two years. In other words, it 
will be necessary for the secondary school either to shorten 
its period, or to send its pupils to college prepared to do 
more advanced work than at present. 
This point of view has been actively in the mind of 
American educators ever since President Eliot of Harvard 
pointed out some thirty years ago the need of conserving 
time in the education of American youth. This is a par- 
ticularly important consideration for the children destined 
for higher education. The European student, after twelve 
years of schooling, enters on real university work of a

specific professional character. The American student, 
under the hitherto established system, if he avails him- 
self of all the facilities for general education, enters on 
his studies four years later. It is true that in many in- 
stances professional work has been and is being done 
during all or part of the college period. This has, how- 
ever, hitherto not been regarded as desirable. The pro- 
posed reorganization of American education as now dis- 
cussed, while partially demanded because of the waste of 
two years which is charged to the old elementary school, 
ordinarily makes no provision to save any of this time. 
The child’s career still winds up after twelve years of 
schooling, with readiness to enter college for still more 
general education at age eighteen, when the European 
student enters on specific professional work of real uni- 
versity character. 
The saving of time is not merely a technical school 
question. It is a practical social problem. The young 
man who, at age twenty-two, still faces four years 
of professional preparation and some years of probable 
apprenticeship, is investing too large a proportion of life 
to preparation. From his personal point of view, as well 
as the social point of view which demands dividends of 
production for investment in support during the economic 
leisure of training, some time must inevitably be saved. 
Summary 
We have seen that the American elementary school is, 
typically, the first phase of formal education, of eight 
years’ duration, offering to all alike a single curriculum, 
which is rudimentary and vernacular, almost never intro- 
ducing the higher or so-called secondary subjects. This
-P-A-G-E-45

school which, because of the recency of the development 
of the high school as a democratic institution for the gen- 
eral education of youth, has a certain tendency to con- 
sider itself as, and therefore organize its work for, the only 
and final unit of education, deals with a psychologically 
non-homogeneous group. Its teaching staff is composed 
of a group largely trained to serve only in the elementary 
school—a group to whom advancement into the secondary 
school is ordinarily not possible. 
This school is being subjected to a series of charges: 
the claim being that it is wasteful of the pupil’s time, 
consuming eight years for work that might be done in 
six. This use of eight years, holding the child to age 
fourteen, means that many children leave school because 
of lack of interest, that those who go on to high school do 
so at a point in their general development not well cal- 
culated to abrupt changes, that curriculum differentiation 
is deferred to too late a period, and that there is a great 
deal of overlapping between the two schools. 
The causes for this state of affairs are historical. It is 
asserted that we borrowed an elementary school calculated 
to furnish complete education to the masses in a country 
where the general population were deliberately barred 
from the higher schools. The reason for our establish- 
ment of this institution was not lack of democracy, but 
the fact that it was not easy to foresee the development of 
the American high school. We gave the elementary 
school more permanence and rigidity, and less capacity 
for development than might have been desirable, by the 
development of a double system of teacher-training, one 
for the elementary and one for the high school. 
The solution of this problem centers about the proposal
-P-A-G-E-46
  30 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
to establish a six-year school. This school would effect a 
saving of time, create a homogeneous group, place the 
change of schools at a more favorable time, and provide 
for earlier differentiation. This school would be delib- 
erately incomplete, the first phase of education, and 
would fit well into the present American teacher-training 
facilities. 
Incidentally, this reorganization will tend to strengthen 
the weaker high schools by adding to the number of their 
pupils and, consequently, their resources. Conversely, it 
will diminish the disadvantages of the ungraded, single- 
teacher rural school by lessening the classes and numbers. 
As a consequence of this reorganization, demand may 
properly be made on the rest of the system to show re- 
sults for the time saved. Students should eventually 
finish their general education two years earlier than at 
present. 
Problems 
1. The question of the proper age for beginning school 
work is, in the foregoing chapters as elsewhere in educa- 
tional literature, assumed to be six. The means of de- 
termining this age, the factors involved, the development 
prerequisite for school work, are a worth-while problem 
for discussion. Where does the home stop and the school 
begin—and why? 
2. Is institutional training before six feasible? Is the 
kindergarten, and perhaps the nursery, a proper part of 
formal education—the first school? 
3. What is the status of preélementary education 
abroad? 
4. What are ideal relations between kindergarten and 
 
-P-A-G-E-47

school? What does the former accomplish in preparation’ * 
for the latter? 
5. Make an independent examination of the history of 
the American elementary school and present conclusions 
in the controverted matter of its origin. 
6. What is your opinion of the six-year school as a 
solution of current problems? Why are facts so far be- 
hind theory—why is the idea so slow in establishing it- 
self? What is the status in your immediate vicinity?

  CHAPTER III 
THE SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND THE GENERAL COMMUNITY 
The State and education—tThe right of the govern- 
ment to control, oversee, and provide for the education 
of its citizens is now so well established everywhere as 
to be beyond dispute. Its right to force individuals to 
send their children to school, to tax the community as a 
whole in order to provide such schooling, to establish 
standards, and otherwise to safeguard the training of 
youth within its borders, has been slowly but firmly es- 
tablished. 
This right in America is the right of the individual 
States. The power to provide for and control the edu- 
cation of the young has in the United States never been 
delegated to the Federal government. It is not of such a 
character as to make such delegation necessary. The 
_ tendency in America has always been to guard jealously 
the powers of the individual State and to limit such 
delegation of powers to those needed for safeguarding 
the welfare of the nation at large. The delegation of 
such powers to the Federal government seems so entirely 
contrary to the genius of our institutions, that its dis- 
cussion would be futile. Within that period of the future 
that can be of practical interest in any discussion, it may 
be said that the national government will never control, 
supervise, and conduct public education. 
35
-P-A-G-E-52
36 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Up to the present time, the State has been satisfied 
when it could be shown that the child was receiving edu- 
cational opportunities. There has been no insistence, in 
other words, that this education be secured in institutions 
either maintained by the State, or if privately maintained, 
then supervised by the State. 
There are governments which conceive of their juris- 
diction as much more extensive. “Throughout Conti- 
nental Western Europe the state has assumed control of 
practically all forms of educational activity. No school 
may be established, no person may teach, no subject may 
be taught, unless the permission of the state is explicitly 
given. Every school established belongs to a certain type, 
and a pupil’s position in the school is regarded as indicat- 
ing approximately his attainments and degree of general 
efficiency. Similarly, every teacher belongs to a certain 
species, determined by his diplomas and experience, and 
can change his status only by modes of procedure recog- 
nized by the state.” + 
A movement from complete liberty of instruction 
toward some form of supervision is evident in America, 
the point in our States being not so much an interest in 
meticulous uniformity of curriculum and procedure as 
a feeling that schools conducted by foreign racial groups 
in foreign languages, having as their primary objects the 
preservation of foreign traditions and loyalties rather 
than general education should, if permitted to exist, come 
under some form of State supervision in the interest of 
the great common welfare. 
Local unit control.—Although possessed of the un-

SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND GENERAL COMMUNITY 37 
limited power so to do, it is an interesting and noteworthy 
fact that the American State in no case exercises the pre- 
rogative of directly controlling the education of the chil- 
dren of the State. The State Board of Education is the 
one body in every commonwealth of the Union which 
ordinarily has no direct control over elementary or secon- 
dary schools. The office of the State Superintendent or 
Commissioner of Education “as originally created in the 
older States was chiefly clerical and statistical,’ ? and 
to-day, quite as much as ever before, depends for its use- 
fulness on the power of the incumbent to exercise unof- 
ficial influence with local communities. The right of the 
State to conduct schools is in America everywhere dele- 
‘gated to local communities. Unlike countries like France 
which have well knit, well thought out, well equalized 
state school systems calculated to care for the education 
of children regardless of geographic location or wealth 
of the local community, we conduct our schools by means 
of local unit control. This system, as is well known, 
«makes for shocking inequalities of support and efficiency 
of education. 
“A great deal has been written and said complimentary 
to the public schools of the United States, concerning their 
high standing and progressiveness, as indicated by the 
constant adoption of new and better methods of teaching, 
and of better buildings and equipment. A general im- 
pression has been created that there exists an American 
school system which is efficient and nation-wide, with 
equal educational opportunities in all parts of the coun- 
try. The impression is erroneous. . . . Opportunities

for education in most of the rural sections of the United 
States are exceedingly meager, in comparison with the 
opportunities offered in cities.” * 
Speaking on the same subject, a competent German ob- 
server whose opinion is reprinted by the Federal Bureau 
_of Education‘ remarks: “Thus we see in the United 
States to-day the sharpest contrasts between school sys- 
tems that are incredibly bad and others of the highest 
possible type that would do credit to the finest civilized 
nations of the globe.” 
“There are, according to estimates made by the United 
States Bureau of Education, approximately 210,000 one- 
teacher rural schools in the United States.”® In Cali- 
fornia alone, as estimated by a recent legislative commis- 
sion, there are 2366 one-teacher rural schools. “The 
number of children (214,928)” living in districts with one- 
teacher schools in Kansas is “considerably more than the 
total population of the entire State of Wyoming and 
nearly three times that of Nevada.” 7 
This system of local unit control is not the result of 
deliberate thinking on the problem of the organization 
of public education. It is a heritage of history. It was 
established at a time when it was a useful, in fact the 
only feasible method of organizing the community for 
the purpose of education. Its roots reach back to the 
very beginnings of settlement in America. Its establish-

ment almost contemporaneously with the church by the 
early Massachusetts settlers was a manifestation of the 
nobility of their aspirations. The local school was or- 
ganized and supported almost before the larger unit of 
colonial government came into existence. 
State-wide standards.—In the course of the years it 
became ever more apparent that absolute local autonomy 
in the matter of schools on the part of minute geo- 
graphical divisions of the commonwealths was intolerable. 
But it has not been the American system to revamp in- 
stitutions, to abolish existing methods, and to create 
totally new ones. Rather has the State undertaken to 
reach its goal of improving educational opportunities for 
children by means of an increasing number of general 
State regulations setting up minimum requirements to 
be attained by every unit of control. A vast amount of 
good has in this way been accomplished everywhere in 
America. It is in this way that we have attained such 
important measures as a compulsory period of schooling 
for every child; a minimum number of months of instruc- 
tion every year; a minimum equipment on the part of 
teachers without which they may not be engaged, as 
controlled by laws of certification; an improvement in 
courses of study and in character of texts to be used, in 
standards for school equipment, and many provisions of 
a similar character. 
Such provisions limit the rights of local communities. 
To the extent of these provisions these communities are 
less free in the conduct of their schools to provide poorer 
facilities. But the State has the ultimate power to regu- 
late education, and has chosen to use this method for 
elevating the standards. In addition to this legislation, 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  40 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
the State has endeavored by unofficial methods to induce 
communities to improve standards. And yet educational 
conditions in America are markedly poor for a country 
so wealthy as ours. 
“In 1918-19 approximately a fourth of all the children 
of the United States were being taught by teachers who 
had less than a high-school education, and who had very 
little or no professional training. We have been satisfied 
in the United States with a lower requirement and less 
training for the teachers in our schools than prevails in 
any other great nation.” ® 
Enlarging the unit of control.—One great remedy has 
been suggested, and a vast amount of agitation in its favor 
has been carried on. This remedy is consolidation. The 
local units themselves have been urged to combine their 
resources, so that by the greater wealth and the larger 
number of children represented by larger geographic 
units, more adequate education may be provided—educa- 
tion more nearly approximating that furnished by the 
cities, which in America have almost exclusively been re- 
sponsible for educational advance. 
“Three distinct units of (rural) organization are in use 
at the present time in the United States—the district, the 
township, and the county.”® By means of agitation, 
permissive legislation, and compulsory legislation we have 
been going forward in the direction of consolidation in 
*Strayer and Engelhardt, “The Classroom Teacher,” p. 18. (Ameri- 
can Book Co., 1920.) But note that there are two types of inequality. 
One is sectional as between States or groups of States. As regards 
this, Federal aid is suggested. The other type of inequality, that 
between rural and urban schools within a given State, is here under 
discussion. 
*US. Bureau of Education Bulletin, 1919, No. 4, p. 13.
-P-A-G-E-57
SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND GENERAL COMMUNITY 41 
a decidedly uneven manner so that to-day the character 
of the local community controlling education ranges from 
a one-teacher district school through the voluntarily con- 
solidated union consisting of several former districts, the 
so-called semi-county method, to the actual abolition of 
districts and the recognition of the county as the sole unit 
for school administration. 
“Experience has taught that for the greatest administra- 
tive efficiency in education the unit of administration 
should conform geographically to the unit used for civil 
administration.” 1° This statement is misleading. The 
difficulty with the district is not that it forms a unit 
within the county, so that conformity to “the unit used 
for civil administration” would mean anything per se. 
The difficulty is that small numbers and limited wealth 
mean limited educational opportunity. The county was 
suggested because it represented geographically the next 
larger unit, and hence a source of greater pooled resources 
and more children for better schools. The question must 
now be faced whether, the country over, the rural county 
is a sufficiently wealthy and populated unit to provide 
facilities for the best in modern education. The State, 
after all, is the ultimate “unit used for civil administra- 
tion.” 
The county unit of educational administration has been 
the utmost asked for by leaders in the consolidation move- 
ment and the advantages rightly claimed for this unit 
in comparison with the smaller unit are numerous. At 
least one-quarter of the States of the Union are now 
organized with the county as the definite and exclusive 
unit of local control. A large number of others are 
*US. Bureau of Education Bulletin, 1919, No. 4, p. 13.
-P-A-G-E-58
42 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
organized on the basis of the so-called semi-county 
system, and the movement in this direction is constantly 
growing in impetus. 
For the purpose of our discussion it may be assumed 
that the county unit system is altogether an advance, and 
that its ultimate establishment throughout the Union is 
quite probable. The advantages of the larger unit have 
frequently been pointed out in educational discussion. 
Generally speaking, it furnishes the means that have been 
at hand in the cities for the improvement of education, 
namely: the opportunity to engage professional super- 
vision; to enrich the curriculum because of the enlarge- 
ment of the schools; to classify children in grades and 
provide a teacher for each grade; and to provide many 
of the opportunities not procurable by the insignificant 
resources of the isolated district. 
The county unit inadequate as a final solution—A 
more important question to face is whether or not the 
county is suitable as a final unit of school control. While 
the rural schools have by consolidation, been getting into 
step with the city systems in supervision, grading, and 
special subjects of instruction such as music, these latter 
have been developing new avenues of educational serv- 
ice for which even county systems must immediately 
find themselves inadequate. As we shall note in later 
chapters, provision for the blind, the deaf, the crippled, 
the tubercular, the mentally defective, the highly en- 
dowed, implies large population and adequate wealth. 
While all these classes must be cared for if we are really 
to provide equality of opportunity for all, the number of 
children per thousand requiring this care is so small and 
the cost of maintaining equipment and furnishing instruc-
-P-A-G-E-59
  SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND GENERAL COMMUNITY 438 
tion is so high, that it is quite safe to say that the 
average rural county can no more undertake the educa- 
tion of these special classes than the one-teacher school 
can become a graded institution. Indeed, for these pur- 
poses, the smaller cities are also becoming inadequate. A 
larger unit of wealth and population is necessary. 
But the need for special forms of education is not the 
only reason for demanding a larger unit. We cannot 
secure a well trained teaching and administrative person- 
nel without it. Ultimately the quality of any school sys- 
tem must depend not on the amount of wealth available, 
or on any of the advantages that have heretofore been 
enumerated in favor of consolidation and of the county 
unit of control, but on the character, training, and out- 
look of the teaching body. The American system of 
public-school control fails to furnish to the prospective 
teacher a career that may be visualized in advance as 
progress step by step from an early beginning to ever 
higher advancement on the basis of experience and the 
accomplishment of a high quality of service. 
The time has come to call attention to the fact that in 
America every change of post means a change of job. 
Generally speaking, teachers are not promoted from po- 
sition to position. They seek to better themselves by 
resigning in one place and applying elsewhere. Except 
in very large units such as the cities represent, and except 
for people who desire to stay within these units, a teacher 
must always carry about with her her bundle of cre- 
dentials, and impress prospective new employers with her 
desirability. She does not advance by promotion; her 
career is not continuous. 
The disadvantages of the system are obvious enough.  
-P-A-G-E-60
44 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Standards of efficiency are not always the same. The 
basis of employment is not always simple professional ef- 
ficiency. Various employers have varying points of view 
regarding the meaning of professional efficiency. The 
higher we advance in the hierarchy of professional serv- 
ice, from teacher to principal, from principal to super- 
visor, from supervisor to the administrator of a larger 
unit, the more glaring becomes the fact that simple ef- 
ficiency and professional ability are not the only bases 
for appointment and advancement. On account of the 
fact that the ultimate control of schools is always and 
everywhere in the hands of lay boards managing a vast 
number of local units, it too frequently seems necessary 
for the aspirant for advancement to cultivate arts other 
than those useful for the pursuit of his profession. 
Local unit control, even when that control shall have 
finally attained to county-wide districts for purposes of 
rural education, is the bane of American education. So 
long as almost every change of work must mean a change 
of job and depend on the ability to impress a new em- 
ployer, so long will American education suffer from lack 
of true professional character. Organization for purposes 
of business is frequently referred to in American educa- 
tional discussion. For purposes of comparison it is almost 
invariably assumed that schools can hardly do better than 
to model their organization on the plans followed by the 
great commercial corporations. These large corporations 
seek to reward merit. They seek to develop employees for 
ever greater responsibility ; they are quick to detect ability 
and to promote for efficiency. A person entering their 
service finds himself at the beginning of a career. 
The State as the unit of control_For purposes of 
improving the educational personnel, we must have in
-P-A-G-E-61
  SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND GENERAL COMMUNITY 45 
America State-maintained systems of schools. We must 
have State-wide school systems supervised by well trained 
experts under whose guidance it will be possible for a 
teacher beginning where her responsibilities are small to 
go forward as far as she may be capable, to ever more 
important posts by promotion, and not by change of job. 
American schools will never attract the most capable men 
and women until they offer a career in the service of the 
State and in the cause of education—until they organize 
a method of detecting, fostering, and rewarding ability. 
But this constant change of employer is not the only 
evil. The hierarchal grading of types of work, making 
some kinds more important than other kinds, no matter 
where and by whom performed, is an equally vicious ar- 
rangement that must be eradicated. Not only is our 
present method of educational control defective in that 
almost every change of post means a change of job, but 
it is also defective in that schools are organized on such 
a hierarchal basis that in order to advance, good teachers 
are endlessly forced to become poor administrators. It 
is assumed in our system that a principal is more worthy 
of reward than a teacher, and a superintendent more so 
than a principal. Ambitious persons beginning as 
teachers who love their work, are perforce compelled to 
look toward administration, since that is considered the 
only basis of real advancement in American schools. 
A well organized system of State schools would offer 
a number of parallel careers of comparatively equal im- 
portance. It would be possible to enter a field, or to 
change from field to field early in one’s career in public 
education, either as a teacher or as an administrator. It 
would be possible for supervising authorities to carry a 
teacher from the least responsibility to ever increasing
-P-A-G-E-62
46 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
  responsibility in her own field; from teaching an un- 
graded school in an isolated district to the responsibility 
of a headship in one field of instruction, in a large city; 
or to promote a principal of a five- or six-teacher school 
continuously until he becomes the superintendent of 
schools in an important city. 
The conduct of schools to-day involves at least three 
parallel and not necessarily related types of service, 
namely: classroom teaching, school-administration and 
constructive educational thinking charged with cur- 
riculum construction, teacher-training, and devising of 
new methods. Our present method of school control in- 
volves the erroneous assumption that a single person, 
administering a school system, will necessarily be as good 
an administrator of numerous business details from the 
purchasing of coal to the construction of a school build- 
ing as he will be a constructive educational thinker and 
leader. The present system of control seems to involve 
the theory that a good classroom teacher will necessarily 
make a good administrator, and therefore regards ap- 
pointment to administrative duties as the only means 
of rewarding excellent teaching service. We have become 
saddled with a totally illogical and vicious hierarchal 
method of school organization, which operates unjustly 
to the individual teacher, and attracts to administration 
a certain proportion of persons who would make better 
classroom teachers, and another proportion of persons 
whose principal qualities consist of ability unrelated to 
the excellent conduct of schools. 
A well organized system of State schools would have 
at least three grand divisions, namely: a division of class- 
room teaching, a division of school administration, and a
-P-A-G-E-63
  SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND GENERAL COMMUNITY 47 
division of constructive educational thinking including 
teacher-training. This State system, using State re- 
sources, would organize schools in accordance with State- 
wide plans varying with varying local conditions and 
needs. Persons entering the service of the State would 
apply for appointment and employment just once; after 
that they would be in a position to look forward uninter- 
ruptedly to a career in the service of education until they 
chose to leave one commonwealth and enter the service 
of another. The number of possible employers would at 
least be limited to forty-eight. Teachers would be moved 
on the basis of ability from one post to another, and it 
would be quite possible that certain teaching positions 
involving great responsibility and indicating fine ability 
would be better paid than some administrative posts. 
Persons in the administrative service likewise would be 
moved from one point of responsibility to another. Those 
responsible for the administration of education in the 
larger cities would have demonstrated their ability in 
smaller ones. Constructive educational thinking would 
include supervision of instruction, the teacher-training 
agencies of the State, and a group responsible for the 
determination of educational objectives as well as educa- 
tional experimentation. It need hardly be added that a 
hard and fast separation, making transfer from one di- 
vision to another impossible, is not here advocated. It 
is also recognized, of course, that concentration of large 
power in the hands of a few individuals has the limitation 
of its virtues. There is hardly anything human that is 
perfect. The suggestion ought not to be measured against 
absolute perfection, so much as against present conditions. 
These conditions are that local unit control with a vast 
   
-P-A-G-E-64
  48 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
number of lay trustees, the great amount of variation 
involved in this system of organization, the impossibility 
of introducing State-wide educational reforms even in the 
most favored States, the need facing the young teacher 
that she change her job and apply to new employers 
every time she wishes to change her location, the need 
of impressing new employers by means other than those 
involved in professional capacity, the inability of un- 
trained laymen to detect good work, and their inability 
to reward it if they did—these things and many others 
make for the retardation and stifling of American 
Education. 
There is at the present time in America no movement 
for State control of schools such as is here advocated. 
Yet, since State control is inherent in the logic of things 
because it will inevitably make for improvement, the 
advantages involved in all likelihood outweighing the 
disadvantages, it would not seem unreasonable to predict 
that leading American commonwealths will be actively 
considering genuine State-wide organization for educa- 
tional purposes, while some of the most backward are 
still considering the advisability of abolishing the district 
system. Institutions change slowly. Maryland adopted 
the county unit of school control in 1865, while Missouri 
adopted the same system in 1921,11 and numbers of States 
in the American Union still possess the district system, 
pure and unalloyed. 
Summary 
The object of this chapter has been to present the 
elementary school as one institution in, and its relation 
“Since repealed by referendum,
-P-A-G-E-65

to, the general organized community. We have seen 
that: 
(1) The power to control education rests with the 
States, but the actual maintenance and control are dele- 
gated to local units organized for this specific purpose. 
The State, though not maintaining the local schools tends, 
by State-wide legislation requiring uniformity, to main- 
tain certain minimum standards. 
(2) There are two causes for the existence of in- 
equality of educational opportunity in America: (1) 
that between States or groups of States, grounded in many 
causes, such as possession of wealth and variation in point 
of view; 1? and (2) that between rural and city schools 
within most States, caused by the inequality of resources 
as between the small one-teacher district and the 
wealthier, more densely populated city. 
(3) The remedy suggested heretofore has been the 
consolidation of districts, the ultimate hope being for 
compulsory consolidation within counties, making this 
unit of civil administration co-extensive with that for 
education. 
(4) The claim made in this chapter is that the county 
has itself become teo small a unit for the maintenance 
of some types of modern educational service which deal 
with children who constitute so small a proportion in 
the population at large, and whose instruction is so ex- 
pensive, that county resources would ordinarily be inade- 
quate to provide them. 
(5) The suggestion is made that the State itself or- 
ganize and maintain a State-wide system of schools for 
general public education, not only because of the increas-

ing difficulty of maintaining high standards on the part 
of small communities, but for two additional reasons: 
(1) State-wide organization would provide one employer, 
and hence the possibility of promotion and a career in 
place of the present system of change of job with every 
change of work. (2) State-wide educational organization 
would make possible a more specialized and scientific 
type of organization consisting of at least three co- 
ordinate kinds of work: teaching; administration; super- 
vision, experimentation, and teacher-training. 
Problems 
1. Centralized control of education for an entire 
country as exemplified in France, for example, has many 
grave disadvantages. It is important to determine 
whether these disadvantages which would probably in- 
here in a State system in America, would outweigh the 
possible advantages. 
2. We have in continental America no example of the 
type of organization recommended in the chapter, but 
the preparation of the skeleton for such an organization 
would furnish an interesting problem. The school sys- 
tem of Hawaii represents an interesting example of non- 
local control under the American flag. 
8. The problem of the control of non-governmental 
educational agencies has merely been touched on in the 
text. How far the State should interest itself beyond 
assurance that every child is offered educational oppor- 
tunities, and undertake varying types and degrees of 
supervision, represents an important question of policy. 
Recent legislation in the State of Oregon definitely pro- 
hibiting the maintenance of non-public schools for young

children represents an extreme view of State power and 
policy that merits consideration.

  CHAPTER IV 
THE SCHOOL INSTITUTION AnD THE IMMEDIATE 
COMMUNITY 
The demand that the school broaden in scope.—The 
American school lives and functions in a democracy. Our 
schools are training the future citizens of a democracy. 
One of the principal characteristics of the American 
school system is its democratic control. It is the business 
of the school to be responsive to the demands of the 
community which it serves. Under many names such 
as school extension, social activities, Americanization, 
and adult education, the community is crowding in on 
the school institution as traditionally organized, and de- 
manding that it broaden its scope and function. 
As usual with vital institutions, actual activities in 
these directions are preceding theory, and the school 
staff and equipment are engaging in a bewildering num- 
ber of occupations totally unrelated to the school as that 
institution has heretofore been understood. Evening 
school, vacation school, after-school playground activities, 
lectures and entertainments for adults, a multitudinous 
number of activities passing under the name of social 
and community center, day nurseries, forums, Americani- 
zation work and instruction in citizenship, exhibitions, 
community fairs and institutes, choral societies, Junior 
Red Cross, thrift and savings enterprises, Boy Scouts, 
52

  SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY 53 
Camp Fire Girls, home gardening projects—these are a 
very few, indeed, of the vast number of activities now 
being carried on more or less under the supervision of 
the school authorities. 
It is not the object of this chapter to enumerate these 
activities in detail. In view of the accessibility of infor- 
mation regarding the subject, as indicated in the bibliog- 
raphy at the end of the chapter, such enumeration and 
description here would be largely a waste of space. 
Rather is it the object of the present chapter to under- 
take an examination of the movement as a whole for the 
purpose of determining whether or not it is properly a 
function of the school, and if so, upon what principles 
school participation in these activities ought to be based. 
As a point of departure for this discussion one may stop 
before this bewildering variety of activities and inquire, 
“What is a school?” Even if the entire scope and sig- 
nificance of that institution is about to be changed, if 
society is about to reshape this great social agency to its 
own larger needs, one may at least ask: “What have 
heretofore been the characteristics of a school?” What 
do other societies understand by the term ‘school’?” The 
answer is naturally obvious. Publicly supported educa- 
tion has been marked, so far as concerns function, by 
these four characteristics: It has been an organized, 
publicly supported institution maintained for the (1) 
instruction of (2) children (3) during certain well defined 
hours and (4) within a fairly well defined scope—in 
America, for example, excluding religious instruction. 
If this fairly well defined scope is about to be enlarged,

  we must know (1) what is being demanded, (2) why the 
demand is being made, and (3) how far, on what princi- 
ples, and with what additional equipment, these demands 
should and can be met. 
What is being demanded—‘No school system,” says 
one writer, “realizes to the full its capacity for community 
service so long as its activities are restricted to the edu- 
cation of children for five or six hours a day, and the 
amount of money invested in thé plant makes such a 
limited use uneconomical in every sense of the term.” ? 
The fundamental idea here seems to be rather the more 
extensive use of the physical plant than the broadening 
of the function of the institution itself. Another writer, 
however, avers that “the school’s function‘ is rapidly 
broadening. School plants are now in various places 
centers of both mental training and bodily training, and 
for adults as well as children. But also they are becoming 
the place where neighbors vote, discuss common affairs, 
view beautiful pictures, hear music, dance, and play. As 
an institution through which society discharges certain 
functions, it is gradually changing its character, and 
while the dynamic forces are social needs, the reason why 
the school has been selected as the place for meeting them, 
is to be found in its central relation to those portions 
of the population which are known as neighborhoods.” * 
Again the emphasis seems to be rather on plant and 
geographic location than upon the school institution itself. 
Were it merely a question of the community use of its 
— equipment at such times as it is not actually re-

quired for its primary purpose, the education of children, 
there would be little to discuss. It is true that there are 
many weeks of the year, and many hours of the day when 
the school plant is not in use in the course of carrying 
on its principal activity, and it is patently right that the 
community make use of it if it so desires. The school 
extension movement began in that way, and the opinion 
in favor of such use has been practically unanimous; but 
the movement has gone farther and deeper. It is now 
quite evidently an effort to involve the very institution 
itself. The right of the school to confine itself to the 
traditional business of educating children is being chal- 
lenged. A demand is being made that it broaden the 
Beancept of its social function, and take up to a larger 
degree the business of community leadership and com- 
munity welfare. 
In Cleveland, for example, “the school system performs 
these services: 
Bathes bodies; Furnishes food; 
Discovers physical defects; Develops physiques; 
Diagnoses ailments; Supervises play; 
Treats diseases; Conducts kindergarténs; 
Administers medicaments; Directs work.” ¢ 
“Tf a child cannot hear the teacher, its ears must be 
treated. If it cannot see the blackboard, its eyes must 
be fitted with glasses. If it is likely to die from tubercu- 
losis during or after receiving its schooling, it must be 
taught in an open-air room. If its brain does not func- 
tion well because of hunger, it must be fed” *—all this 
by the school, not the parent.

Survey, 1916.)

  56 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
  Pressure is coming from many directions, loudly and 
incessantly. Behind a spontaneous and insistent de- 
mand of this sort there must be fundamental reasons. 
When the school is called upon to take up to an ever 
greater degree the duty of parent and friend, guardian, 
guide and counsellor; to undertake the supervision of 
recreation, cultural assimilation, national integration, and 
the provision of neighborhood social activities, it is evi- 
dent that one of two things must be true: Hither the 
community is searching for new types of activities hither- 
to supervised by no institution, or it is seeking expression 
in old fields hitherto supervised by old institutions which 
no longer function. Is the school capable of undertaking 
new functions? Is it proper that it should undertake 
to expand to meet them? If so, what adjustment should 
it look forward to in the future? 
Reasons behind the demand for a broader interpreta- 
tion of the function of the school—We moderns, and 
particularly we moderns in the United States of America, 
are living in a transitional period of the world’s history, 
characterized by an absence of clear-cut institutions and 
forces tending toward social unification and integration. 
In the era immediately preceding our own, there were 
many factors that tended toward a social unification and 
integration of certain naturally formed local groups. In 
the Middle Ages these factors were unity of religion, since 
all belonged to the one inclusive Church; a common 
political fealty, since all equally owed allegiance to the 
local feudal lord; a common isolation and mutual inter- 
dependence in view of the lack of facilities for, and the 
dangers involved in, travel as well asthe absence.of rapid 
verbal communication with distant communities, and
-P-A-G-E-73
SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY _ 87 
lack of printed material in the form of newspapers and 
other periodicals so common in our day; community of 
race and tradition since people were living in the very 
spots where their ancestors had lived before them for 
generations, and in the very presence of the great archi- 
tectural monuments erected by them; as well as similarity 
of laws and lore. 
Even to-day in communities other than our own, there 
still are operative certain great unifying factors, par- 
ticularly those of common national ideals based on com- 
munity of race and language. Countries like Japan, 
and France, do not face the need of assimilating groups 
of startling proportions to their language and cultural 
ideals. From these points of view at least, they represent 
unified group life. 
But in our country and in this day, the problem of 
social integration is imposing. The factors tending in 
directions counter to such integration are many, and no 
single institution has yet been discovered beyond ques- 
tion best adapted to act as the great unifying medium. 
A government per se can never be used as such a unify- 
ing means, for governments are necessarily and in the 
nature of things impersonal in their operation. They 
command respect and loyalty, but these may be given 
in many languages and out of varying motives. In the 
fields of industry and religion, the possibility of division 
into small groups seems greater than that of the cohesion 
of very large masses of the population. Abroad, even 
to-day, large geographic units are predominantly of simi- 
lar religious views. Even economically, in rural countries 
like Russia, or small industrial countries like Switzerland, 
the business of carrying on the production and distribu-
-P-A-G-E-74
| 58 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
tion of things does not tend to a sharp division between 
labor and capital as is the case in America to-day. 
Again, the transient character of our population made 
possible by freedom of movement and the lure of oppor- 
tunities, the large foreign-language groups, groups which 
at the same time represent varying cultural backgrounds 
and tradition, all make against, rather than for cohesion 
on a national scale. 
The school as a possible means of social integration. 
—Yet such cohesion, unification, and integration, there 
must ultimately be, and the forces making for such unifi- 
cation for the nation are unconsciously trying out various 
agencies in the hope of finding one that will function 
continually and effectively. The real meaning of the 
school extension movement is that the adaptability of 
the school as a socializing agency that may be used for 
this great purpose is being tried out. For such purposes 
this agency is new, its traditional methods are unadapted 
and untried; but the attempt to use it must be made. 
These forces of nationalization in trying out one agency 
after another, have evidently not found one that comes 
as near to satisfying their demands as does the school. 
The school possesses a plant that is ready for use and 
can be made continually more adaptable. The school is 
centrally located. The school is the one agency which 
as yet is above suspicion on the part of the representatives 
of any point of view, religious, political, or economic. 
The school is the only universal institution in America 
where all may meet without compromise of any sort on 
the part of any. 
Three possible types of school extension.—There are 
three principal ways in which the school may be used for 
the purposes under discussion:

(1) [the community may use merely the school plant, 
without demanding any other service whatsoever. As an 
example of this type of use, note the thirty-six different 
local activities that were carried on during non-school 
hours in one of the Cleveland schools: *

(2) The school plant may be used for the purpose of 
community activities under a special corps of workers, 
and is so used in many communities. 
(3) The school may be used for purposes of extension 
with the school staff as the supervising agency. , 
Use of school plant only.—Referring to the first two 
types of extension involving use of the plant but not the 
services of the school staff, to what extent should such 
use be permitted during non-school hours? Should the 
authorities undertake to censor the activities and lay 
down regulations as to the type of activities which may, 
and the type which may not, be carried on? Should the 
school undertake to censor the discussions? 
If the building is open at all, and it seems agreed that 
the community should have the privilege of using it, fair- 
ness would seem to demand that it be open to all groups 
for varying purposes without distinction. Assuming that 
no damage is done and that no activities are carried on 
calculated to interrupt the use of the plant for the primary 
purpose of educating children, citizens should be per- 
mitted to use the plant freely, each group in its own 
manner. If the plant is opened at all, it should be open 
to any organization and for any purpose that does not 
violate the common conceptions of decency and morality. 
It does not seem desirable that the school should take 
sides on &ny issue, even though the division may be one 
into a préponderant group on the one hand and a very 
small one on the other. So long as an activity is not incon-
-P-A-G-E-77
  SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY 61 
sistent with the use of the building for its primary pur- 
pose, the principle ought to be that a group activity 
which may be legally carried on anywhere in the com- 
munity may be permitted on the school premises. They 
causes for barring the use of the premises should be 
three: (1) abuse of property; (2) immorality; (3) 
| illegality. ‘ 
If the opinion noted above is correct—namely, that 
only that agency can function for social integration in 
America which is above suspicion on the part of the rep- 
resentatives of any point of view, religious, political, or 
economic—then the school cannot be partisan. “There 
are likely to occur now and then discussions which will 
provoke public criticism. Some people will feel that an- 
other class of people is promoting abhorrent doctrines 
through the use of a commonly owned and supported 
public building. But so long as the constitutional 
guarantee of free speech is preserved, people will talk, 
and if the principles of democracy are sound our institu- 
tions have nothing to fear from open, all-round, orderly 
discussion of all common interests. It is when propa- 
gandism is carried on in obscure places, away from the 
cleansing light of experience and the searching criticism 
of practical facts, that it may become dangerous and 
foment strife. The right way of satisfying public interest 
in controversial questions is to make them the subjects 
of fair, able, and dignified discussions at the community 
center, and to supply information upon them by means 
of lectures and illustrated talks.” 7 
School extension implying use of plant and service of 
personnel.—A far more perplexing problem thah that of 
"Educational Extension, pp. 106-107. (Cleveland Education Survey.)
-P-A-G-E-78
62 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
permitting community use of plant and equipment is the 
demand and tendency, the assumption of the correctness, 
of the use of the school plant under the supervision, 
guidance, and leadership of the school staff. In view of 
the many types of activity, classification into types on 
some basis represents the only means of approach to a 
discussion of principles. For our purpose, this third type 
of school extension can best be considered under two 
heads, i.e., (a) the school and the child; (b) the school 
and the adult community. 
The school and the child.—Certain phases of the 
school’s interest in the welfare of the child are now so 
completely established as correct school practice that they 
can no longer be referred to as extension. The kindergar- 
ten, the after-school playground, the nursery, open-air 
and vacation schools, and school luncheons, are a few 
of the many examples of activities initiated by private 
agencies because the need for them existed, and later 
taken over by the schools. The study and care of incor- 
rigibles, for example, is now established and represented 
in attendance departments and parental schools. Many 
phases of the physical welfare of the child, involving 
health and nutrition, and presupposing medical care and 
feeding, are also becoming as firmly established as train- 
ing in reading and writing. These already established 
phases of extended interest in the child will be dealt with 
later.® 
The question here is rather one of enlarging the mean- 
ing of nurture so far as the school is concerned and ex- 
tending school care and interest in the welfare of the 
children not only by increasing types of care during the 
*See Chapters VI, VII, and VIII.
-P-A-G-E-79
SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY _ 63 
  school period, but actually extending the time to what 
have heretofore been non-school hours and non-school 
years. For the years preceding school, the kindergarten 
and, indeed, the nursery school are beginning to function 
in loco parentis; during inter-school periods the vacation 
school is functioning; and during non-school hours, 
schools are beginning to provide recreation, social as well 
as physical, that heretofore seemed to belong in a very 
special way to the home. It is quite possible that the 
home, like other hitherto more effective factors, such as 
religion, community of race and of political allegiance, 
and the implication of geographic grouping and isolation, 
is beginning to break down. 
What is the duty of the school under these conditions? 
The answer would seem obvious. The school is com- 
mitted to the development of childhood, to nurture. As an 
institution it began by taking over and doing better some 
of the work of child-training which had theretofore been 
carried on in the home. It was the incompetence of the 
home under conditions of growing social complexity, that 
first made necessary a specialized agency for nurture. No 
arbitrary limits can or need be established. As rapidly 
as the home becomes less competent and the school better 
equipped, and as rapidly as the community which uses 
the school as an instrumentality makes the demand, so 
rapidly must the school undertake new phases and rein- 
terpret the meaning of education. 
Reasons for decreasing adequacy of the home.— 
Meanwhile there may be noted in passing some of the 
reasons for the current and apparently growing tendency 
of the home to abdicate in favor of the school. It is a 
commonplace that the home as a factor in the nurture
-P-A-G-E-80
  64 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
of children is ever decreasing in efficiency. The reasons 
for this are numerous, and all of them can hardly be 
listed. Four main sources may be noted as factors that 
probably will continue to be responsible for decreasing the 
efficiency of the home: 
1) The constant increase of scientific information, 
skiN and technique, regarding the care and welfare of 
children, by its mere accumulation, tends to make the 
home less competent even where the home itself is not 
deteriorating. Just as the development of high specializa- 
tion and perfection of product in spinning, weaving, 
baking, and canning makes the modern home a less com- 
petent means of doing these things, so specialized infor- 
mation and skill in the field of nurture operates toward 
the same end. In an age of industrial specialization we 
have slowly adopted new concepts of home; the woman 
at the spinning wheel is no longer a proper symbol for 
that institution. Evidently its relation to the child, too, 
is to be modified. 
(2) In modern times many mothers participate in in- 
dustrial labor outside the home and, by their very ab- 
sence, they make it a less suitable place for the best and 
ynost complete rearing of children. 
(3) The proportion of the population residing in 
cities is constantly increasing; the urban home is becom- 
ing constantly smaller, as is the surrounding territory 
available for child experience. The supervised formal 
play center is of necessity replacing the hills, fields, roads, 
and streams that formerly were the environment well 
meriting the term “home.” 
(4) The transient character of urban industrial 
workers and the presence of large sections of recent immi- 
grants whose standards and concepts and ideals are not
-P-A-G-E-81
  SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY _ 65 
completely suited as a medium for the development of 
future Americans, represent still another phase of the 
inadequacy of the home. 
At the same time that the home is becoming a less 
competent institution for child nurture, modern science, 
and the experts and social workers representing the find- 
ings of modern science, are bringing ever greater pressure 
for improving conditions making for child welfare. In the 
very presence of the decrease of home efficiency, we have 
an increased demand and pressure for attention to the 
many details in the care of the child, such as nutrition, 
care of teeth and eyes. 
The inference seems to be clear enough that the time 
has arrived when the school must enlarge its conception 
of nurture, and interest itself in the welfare of children, 
taking for its task more than intellectual development. 
The school must build up efficiency in the general care 
of children, and this efficiency must extend beyond physi- 
cal welfare, and include moral and social development as 
well. It is becoming more and more important for the 
school authorities to be well acquainted with the other 
agencies engaged in protecting children,—the agencies for 
the relief of poverty, the juvenile court, and other 
agencies that deal with delinquency, as well as the com- 
mercial agencies that provide recreation for children. 
All modern life, particularly in our American cities, is 
tending to burden the school with an ever increasing care 
of the children, and it is becoming the business of the 
school to acquaint itself with the problems involved and 
the best means of their solution. 
The school and the adult community.—We come now 
to the group of extension non-traditional school activities 
which establish relations between the school and the adult 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  
  66 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
community. Some of these are initiated by the school for 
school purposes, namely: the better education of children. 
Some represent the school’s participation in civic affairs, 
involving teachers, or children, or both. Others, again, 
represent really definite, concrete extension of scope. 
(1) Activities initiated by the school for school pur- 
poses.—The first type referred to, the activities initiated 
by the school for school purposes, is best illustrated by 
the home teacher movement now in process of develop- 
ment in certain American cities. The present practice is 
to relieve certain particularly well suited teachers from 
part or all of their teaching duties and sending them to 
the homes of certain pupils. The objects of this visiting 
are as yet vague and ill defined. The activities are nu- 
merous and varied, centering around the goal of contact, 
mutual understanding, better codperation between school 
and home for the greatest ultimate good of the child. 
We are witnessing here the development of a social- 
service phase of the organized conduct of public educa- 
tion. The school has had contacts with the home before: 
The attendance officer is no longer a policeman—he may 
help secure shoes to assist in sending children to school. 
The nurse has for some time been visiting in a friendly 
capacity, advising that needed surgical or optical service 
be secured, or that the character of child-feeding and 
general hygiene be improved. The visiting teacher comes 
as a friend with more general, less well-defined purposes, 
prepared to teach the use of soap or of English verbs. 
Around her all the scattered social-service tendencies and 
existing activities will doubtless become organized into 
a new phase of public education. 
Other points of contact, either initiated by the school
-P-A-G-E-83
  SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY 67 
or gladly accepted by it, are organizations outside the 
school whose members are not teachers, and whose pri- 
mary or partial purpose it is to aid the school for the 
good of the child. Local mothers’ clubs, settlements, so- 
cial service and relief agencies of every type, particularly 
those organized specifically for juvenile welfare, are typ- 
ical of the sources and the kind of help. Between these 
agencies and the school, the bond should be close. The 
school should not merely note their existence, but codper- 
ate heartily for the welfare of youth. Notable among 
these interested but unofficial agencies is the national 
organization of parent- -teachers associations which now 
has a most imposing country-wide program for aiding 
the schools. 
(2) The school’s participation in civic affairs—We 
must now note the demand that the school participate in 
civic affairs. This demand may involve children, it may 
involve teachers particularly, or it may involve both. 
The principles that should underlie and guide such par- 
ticipation ought to be noted: The request is frequently 
made for supervised pupil participation in the actual life 
activities of the community. There is an ever increasing 
impatience with the view that the school is a place apart 
by itself. Many agencies representing great social forces 
local and national in scope, are demanding the privilege 
of involving the children in actual adult activities—a 
fact that was so thoroughly demonstrated during the 
great war as to need no illustration. These social agencies 
are relying on the school more and more because the 
children in the school represent the surest means of uni- 
versal appeal, the easiest means of effectively reaching 
the largest numbers.
-P-A-G-E-84
  68 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
This tendency involves some advantages and some 
dangers. The primary business of the school is educa- 
tion. In so far as the movements demanding the use 
of the school and the participation and activities of the 
children represent material and activities that can be 
advantageously used in furthering the education of the 
children without demanding a disproportionate amount 
of time and energy, they are good. During the War, the 
activities of the Junior Red Cross and the participation 
of the schools in the sale of Thrift stamps and Liberty 
bonds as well as other activities obviously national in 
character and for the common good of all, lent them- 
selves well as part of the general educational scheme. 
It was easy to employ these activities as group projects, 
as means of unifying the school population for great and 
good purposes, and that integration was necessary to 
success. So long as these activities serve a definite edu- 
cational end, or where they serve no such end, are ad- 
mittedly worthy social endeavors to which no propor- 
tion of the social group may rightfully object, they are 
‘proper school activities. 
But the school is under constant pressure to carry on 
\activities regarding whose worthiness these statements 
cannot be made. The school is being asked to take sides 
in economic questions and other matters in a state of 
controversy, fields which it must absolutely avoid, if it 
is to retain the confidence of all. If the reason why 
the agencies toward integration which we have been dis- 
cussing have been attempting to use the school is that it 
is almost the only institution of universal appeal and 
extent entirely above suspicion, then the school must 
be most careful to avoid activities which represent any 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  
  SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY 69 
single group, no matter how large. The school must 
avoid partisanship in every field. It must not commit 
itself on mooted points. It must confine its activities to 
fields in which practically without question the entire 
community is agreed. Economic division and discussion 
seem to have replaced to some extent in our day the old 
religious controversies, and the school, if it is to remain 
absolutely above suspicion, and to retain the confidence 
of all, must avoid partisanship in this field. The school 
does not exist for the purpose of representing any par- 
ticular point of view, no matter how thoroughly the 
teachers are in agreement with that point of view.® 
Then comes the ever increasing demand for teacher- 
participation in the general community activities. It is, 
of course, a point beyond debate that the teacher should 
be an active and good citizen, but the further demand is 
made, and particularly in rural communities, that the 
teacher furnish leadership in general community activi- 
__ties. Is the ability to furnish such leadership necessarily 
involved in the general equipment and training for the 
education of children? Is the demand that the teacher 
be a civic and social leader as well as a teacher, well 
grounded? Is it possible to satisfy this demand by train- 
ing? Can teacher-training institutions meet it? These 
are questions to which we shall return in a later section. + 
Before facing them we must note the final demand for 
school extension; namely, definite, concrete extension of 
scope involving not only non-traditional activities, but 
non-traditional participants in these activities—adults.

regard of these principles, see J. H. Maurer, “Labor’s Demand for Its

(3) School work with~adults.—The activities here 
referred to may probably be grouped under three heads; 
namely, (a) primarily education of the old type, involv- 
ing principally instruction; (6) recreational, including 
social as well as physical or sport activities; and (c) civic 
leadership. 
By way of educational procedure, the school interests 
itself in the education of adults established in the com- 
munity whose schooling has been meager, or in the edu- 
cation of recently arrived foreigners, who require instruc- 
tion not merely in the language but in the history and 
institutions of the country to which they have come. 
By way of recreational activities, the school, acting as 
a social center, and undertaking to organize the social 
life of the neighborhood, may undertake to supervise ac- 
tivities of a large variety ranging from athletics and 
social clubs to dances, concerts, and art exhibitions. 
The demarid for leadership in civic affairs, particularly 
in rural communities, has already been noted. In some 
cases this demand on the energy, ability, and adaptability 
of the teacher has been brilliantly met.1° 
The question of principle now presents itself most 
clearly. How far shall the school extend? What are 
the proper limits beyond which it should not go? What 
bases and guiding principles are there to assist in making 
decisions? 
In so far as the demand represents true school extension 
in the form of-instruction proper, the decision is easily 
reached. The school is the public instrumentality for in- 
struction and it can, and should, teach adults as well as 
children. This disposes of the first of the three activities 
* See E. Dewey, New Schools for Old. (Dutton, 1917.)
-P-A-G-E-87
  SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY 71 
referred to, and leaves eS discussion; namely, the 
provision of facilities and leadership in adult recreational 
and civic activities. : 
A glance at the foregoing discussion may assist in for- 
mulating conclusions: We have seen that, for certain 
reasons, old means of social leadership are ceasing to be 
effective and demand is being made on the school that 
it enlarge its scope. This demand involves both plant 
and teaching personnel. Plant and equipment, with 
certain safeguards and with complete impartiality, should 
be fully extended. Increased types of activity on the 
part of the school personnel involve either children or 
adults. Every type of activity making for child welfare, 
no matter how new and hitherto unheard of, should be 
engaged in. In relation to the adult community we note 
a demand for school participation in general community 
activities of a civic nature which should be complied with, 
provided and so long as they have educational value and 
are not partisan. Finally we come to the demand that 
the school personnel, children being not at all involved, 
should supervise certain adult activities. In so far as 
these call for instruction, the demand may readily be met, 
since it involves for adults a kind of work in which the 
school is skilled and for the performance of which it is 
the obvious and, indeed, the only existing agency. 
On the other hand the supervision of adult community 
activities—such as adult recreation, physical, mental, 
and social—as well as leadership of the adult community 
in civic affairs, can hardly be regarded as mere extension. 
This demand clearly and definitely is a demand for service 
beyond and in addition to and not merely an extension of 
the function of teaching, training, and developing of chil-
-P-A-G-E-88
72 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
  dren. While some particularly brilliant individuals such 
as Mrs. Harvey in Missouri’! may find it possible to 
combine with teaching general social leadership, it does 
not seem reasonable to demand such a combination of 
functions of teachers in general, nor does it seem right to 
hold absence of ability in such leadership against other- 
wise excellent teachers. 
Indeed, it would probably be definitely detrimental to 
the teaching profession to urge it upon teachers as a 
whole that these additional obligations are properly the 
function of the teacher. It is taken for granted that every 
teacher should show himself a good citizen, and should 
participate actively in the affairs of the community. But 
leadership in general civic affairs of the adult community 
is decidedly dissociated from teaching. If it is deemed 
wise and desirable that the school, aside from lending its 
plant, should actually undertake the varied amount of 
activities that go under the name of school extension, it 
is the business of the school authorities as well as the 
teacher-training institutions to develop new and ad- 
ditional personnel. 
It may, indeed, happen with some degree of frequency 
that certain well-trained teachers also develop this quality 
of leadership, but it seems vital that a differentiation of 
function should be recognized and that a combination of 
function should not be demanded. Such demand while 
making many good teachers unhappy in the conviction 
that they are not capable of rising to professional re- 
quirements, will yet fail in bringing about the desired 
results. It is impracticable to believe that even the best 
teacher-training institutions will graduate young teachers 
™See E. Dewey, New Schools for Old. (Dutton, 1917.)
-P-A-G-E-89
SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY 73 
who will be equipped at the same time for teaching and 
for social leadership in rural and urban communities. 
That these institutions can meet this demand is a delu- 
sion. Training and knowledge are not enough, even 
though the normal schools and other teacher-training in- 
stitutions found it possible to give such training and 
knowledge in addition to technical preparation. Leader- 
ship involves maturity, and maturity implies age and 
experience, characteristics which the best teacher-train- 
ing institutions will find it difficult to supply to their 
graduates. 
If the school is the proper agency for meeting the great 
demand that some institution undertake the social inte- 
gration of the group, social, educational, and civic, then 
the school should consider this as a new, additional func- 
tion rather than mere extension, and should provide for 
this purpose different additional personnel, not necessarily 
teachers—a personnel of different training and experience. 
The tendency to blame young teachers for not organizing 
their community socially and in the manner in which 
certain of them have been able to do, the assumption that 
this type of thing can be done, will undoubtedly work 
harm. 
Summary 
The school as an organized institution existing for 
the instruction of children within a well defined field and 
within definite hours of the day is, in America, facing the 
demand that it broaden in scope and take on other ac- 
tivities and other classes of the population, employing 
for this purpose not only its plant and equipment, but its 
personnel as well.
-P-A-G-E-90

74 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
The reason for the demand is probably to be found in 
the fact that other institutions, hitherto operative in 
maintaining social cohesion, have become inoperative un- 
der modern conditions. 
The school is the institution being tried out for this 
purpose because it is probably the only institution which 
is universal, coming into contact with the entire popula- 
tion, and above suspicion from the point of view of social, 
economic, or religious doctrine. 
Extension may imply use of school plant and equip- 
ment without supervision or under supervision of agencies 
other than the school. It may also imply supervision of 
school personnel as well as use of school plant. 
I. In the first instance, school plant and equipment 
should be available for community use during non-school 
hours without censorship or partisan favoritism, so long 
as the activities carried on are not immoral, illegal, or de- 
trimental to property. 
II. Where school extension implies supervision on the 
part of school personnel as well as use of plant and equip- 
ment, many questions arise. Extension in this instance 
may deal with either children or adults. 
A. Where it concerns children this extension must 
respond to the needs of the day and, as the family for 
many reasons becomes less competent, the school must 
take on new aspects of care during school hours and 
totally new functions during non-school hours and be- 
tween school sessions. 
B. School extension in relation to the adult com- 
munity may be of three possible types: 
1. The first type is found in the effort of the school 
to establish contact with the community for the better
-P-A-G-E-91
  SCHOOL INSTITUTION AND IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY 7% 
carrying on of its work. School visitors going to the 
home and parent-teachers associations coming to the 
schools, represent this group of activities. 
2. A second type of the school’s relationship with the 
adult community is exemplified in participation by the 
school group in such general activities as Red Cross work 
or the Thrift stamp movement. 
8. Finally we come to a group of extension activities 
involving the school plant, the school personnel, and in- 
dividual adults. These may be classified as: 
a. Furnishing instruction. 
b. Supervising recreation, athletic and social. 
c. Leadership in civic undertakings. 
It would seem that furnishing instruction to adults is 
a natural extension of school work, for which the school 
has facilities and skill. On the other hand, it would seem 
unwarranted to demand that individual teachers be also 
apt in social and civic leadership. If the school must 
enter this field of the organization of the adult com- 
munity for recreational and civic ends, then specially 
adapted and equipped persons should be employed for 
that purpose. 
Problems 
This chapter does not discuss in detail either the scope 
or the technique of the numerous activities which go un- 
der the name of school extension. The interested student 
will find in the books and pamphlets referred to, and in 
the bibliographies therein noted, ample opportunities for 
studies of these activities. 
Need for different types of extension activities varies
-P-A-G-E-92
  76 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
with time and place. A local survey, along the lines out- 
lined by Boyer, should prove of interest. 
Social service and extension features of modern school 
systems are at present scattered. Some come within the 
purview of the school physician, some in that of the 
recreation department, some in that of the attendance 
department. An interesting problem is found in the need 
for developing and organizing in detail a central depart- 
ment of home contact, which shall include all these 
activities.

CHAPTER V 
THE PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF THE PRINCIPAL AND 
THE TEACHER 
I. The Place of the Principal in American School 
Organization. 
No phase of the organization of public education in 
America affords a clearer illustration of the fact that in 
a functioning institution practice precedes theory, than 
the office of the principalship in a typical city school sys- 
tem. The office exists; there are principals busily at 
work; but it is an anomalous office in that its function, 
its reason for being, and its goals are not clear. 
“Tt would be difficult to find any feature of school or- 
ganization,” says one city superintendent, “in which a 
greater range of varying practices is to be found than the 
one suggested by this subject”; 1 and the principal in one 
of the larger American cities remarks, in referring to the 
same topic, “Many principals are not clear in their own 
minds as to their rightful place in the school organism 
and the peculiar functions of that place.” ? 
Here we have an example of an official actually func- 
tioning; obviously there is need for some person to per- 
form his duties. Until we define these duties, however,

and determine on some theoretic basis their character and 
scope, it is impossible to determine the type of official the 
schools desire, or to pass judgment on the character of 
his work. 
There are two types of status held by principals. First, 
there is the principal of a one- or two-building school sys- 
tem or of an elementary-school district who is responsible 
to the Board direct, since that Board employs no superin- 
tendent. This principal is in effect the superintendent, 
the expert educational adviser of the Board. There is no 
one between him and the lay Board who depend on him 
for guidance and advice in the technical field of education. 
As to the functioning of this fortunately situated person, 
there is no discussion here. Obviously every problem of 
the elementary school comes within his scope. 
The official whose functioning is here under discussion 
is the head of the school building in a system which is — 
large enough to employ a superintendent. In this sys- 
tem he is not a teacher, for that work is done by the 
classroom teachers of his building. On the other hand 
he is presumably not responsible for the initiation of 
educational policies, changes, and reforms. It is the 
superintendent to whom the lay Boards of Education look 
for guidance in all matters of school work. Between this 
Seylla and Charybdis, what is the principal? Is he an 
educator at all? 
Is the building principal an educational official? —One 
may approach this problem by asking two questions: 
(1) Is there need for this functionary? (2) If so, is there 
need for him as an educational official? Is or should the 
principal be part of the technical educational staff of the 
school system? The first of these questions obviously is
-P-A-G-E-99
PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF PRINCIPAL AND TEACHER 83 
  answered as soon as asked. There must be some one in 
whom the thousand details of the organization of the 
building unit center. The second question is not so easy 
to answer, for if one should be in agreement with that 
group “comprising many able and successful superintend- 
ents” who hold “that the principal’s work is concerned 
chiefly with following directions from the central office,” * 
then it would hardly be proper to dignify a principal with 
the term educator. That term, if it means anything, in- 
volves the right to initiate policies and think on the prob- 
lems of education. 
In an admirable series of articles in the “Elementary 
School Journal” referred to in detail in the bibliography 
at the end of this chapter, a number of experienced edu- 
cational thinkers set themselves the problem of determin- 
ing what it is that the principal actually does. In order 
to gather the data which must precede the theory of a 
function, the sources and means of securing information 
were varied, but they were no less so than the actual data 
gathered. 
One of the most exhaustive statements, made on the 
basis of large actual experience by a principal, may be 
tabulated briefly for our purposes as follows: 
I. Administrative Duties. 
A. Annual and semiannual routine. 
1. Supplies and equipment. 
2. Promotion and transfer of classes. 
8. Individual cases of promotion. 
4. Classifying new pupils. 
5. Checking up the permanent records of pupils.

  6. Reports to the superintendent. 
7. Making schedules. 
8. Commencement exercises. 
B. Daily routine. 
1. Inspection of building and grounds. 
2. Inspection of janitor service. 
3. General management of pupils on the play- 
grounds and about the building during the 
period in which they are permitted to come 
upon the premises before school work begins. 
4, Excluding pupils from school because of physi- 
cal unfitness, contagious diseases or uncleanli- 
ness. 
5. Looking after attendance. 
6. Cases of general and special discipline. 
7. Taking care of pupils who remain in school 
during luncheon periods. 
C. Miscellaneous duties. 
1. Fire drills. 
2. School enterprises and activities. 
3. Parent-teachers organizations. 
4. Teachers’ meetings. 
5. School exhibits. 
II. Pedagogical Duties. 
A. Teaching classes. 
B. Supervision. 
C. Adapting subject-matter and courses of study to 
pupils. 
Large as the foregoing scope is, it does not seem to be 
exhaustive. Another writer® in the series already re- 
ferred to says that the duties of the school principal are 
threefold: 
First, under administration and clerical duties he 
notes such things as looking after pay-rolls, special re- 
°R. A. Spencer, “The Work of a School Principal in Supervision.” 
Elementary School Journal, Vol. XX, p. 176.
-P-A-G-E-101
  PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF PRINCIPAL AND TEACHER 85 
ports, school organization, transfer of pupils to and from 
other schools, dealing with attendance officers and super- 
visors, codperation with outside activities such as the sale 
of Thrift stamps during the War. 
Second, under the topic “plant,” he notes the duty of 
the principal to go into such details as heat, light, venti- 
lation, cleaning; and discipline in class, on the grounds, 
and in the building at large. 
Finally he mentions the need of classification and re- 
classification of pupils, making of schedules, programs 
in special subjects, and securing proper material for 
teachers. 
Obviously the principal has a great deal to do. Are 
his duties educational in character? Should he be looked 
upon as an educational officer? At least some of the 
leaders in educational thought are of this opinion. “The 
great fundamental duty of the principal,” says the super- 
intendent already quoted, “is to make of his school an 
institution in which to the greatest extent possible the 
real ends of public education in this country of ours are 
being realized”; ® and, to quote another thinker on the 
problem: “The principal should be regarded as the re- 
sponsible head of his school, and as such he is invested 
with duties managerial, professional, and social in 
character.” 7 
Here then we have a situation requiring attention. 
Neither educational thinkers nor principals agree on the 
character of the work to be done, on the types to be 
stressed, on any classification of duties. In many in-

86 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
stances it is obvious that schools are being conducted on 
“an archaic theory of management,” but even the student 
who makes this charge is forced to admit that “a new 
supervisory theory is only in its beginning,” and that “we 
have relatively few clarified ideas as to the nature and 
place of the principal’s work.” There is a “dearth of 
accepted ideas as to the specific things of a professional 
character that the principal should do,” continues Pro- 
fessor Bobbitt. “It is currently conceived that the Board 
and superintendent have original jurisdiction over gen- 
eral policies, rules, regulations, lines and methods of 
work, etc., and that teachers have the task of obediently 
carrying out the orders centrally originated. Since the 
principal within such a scheme is responsible for neither 
the general policies and directions nor the detailed class- 
room labors, he becomes but an intermediary without 
original function.” § 
It need hardly be emphasized that there is no need 
of creating useless and duplicating educational function- 
aries. If the institution of the principalship as it has 
developed is, indeed, an office “without original function,” 
and if all the functions of a truly educational nature are 
now being performed by the superintendent and his 
supervisory force on the one hand, and the classroom 
teaching staff on the other, it may well be that we have 
outgrown the principalship as an educational instrumen- 
tality—that the principalship has become a necessary 
but non-educational agency of the central office within 
the individual building. 
Obviously, one of the reasons for the divergence in the 
*F. Bobbitt, “The Building Principal in the Surveys.” Elementary 
School Journal, Vol. XIX, p. 106.
-P-A-G-E-103
  
PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF PRINCIPAL AND TEACHER 87 
theory of the functioning of the principal is due to the 
fact that the field is so large that varying principals may 
devote themselves fully to any one phase of work in ac- 
cordance with their particular ideas. And so Professor 
Gray was able to find four sets of ideas of principals as 
to their functions almost totally divergent in character: ® 
(1) ¢ One principal felt that his duties consisted pri- 
marily of office routine, looking after physical conditions, 
securing classroom material, keeping track of attendance 
and records; dealing with nurses and truant officers, and 
saving the time of the classroom teachers by looking 
after all details. 
(2) Another thought that his principal function was 
the supervision of teaching, and the care of new or old 
inefficient teachers; the holding of conferences, suggest- 
ing additional reading, and in general improving in- 
struction. : 
(3) A third principal felt that his primary business 
consisted of giving educational tests, and securing ob- 
jective data for the purpose of presenting such material 
to teachers, showing them the status of their instruction 
and suggesting to them changes and emphasis; also the 
reclassification of pupils on the basis of these data, thus 
making his supervision effective. 
(4) Finally, a fourth principal conceived it as his 
chief function to cheer and encourage teachers, and to 
secure the codperation of parents. 
Here then we have this official coming in contact with 
the central school authorities, the local community, and 
responsible for the physical plant as well as the health,

  88 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
morals, recreation, and education of his pupil community; 
dealing with teachers, organizing their work, and func- 
tioning as an educational leader.) Is there an inevitable, 
a less arbitrary means of describing, analyzing, and group- 
ing the functions of the principalship, a way: really in- 
herent in the office itself? Are his functions necessarily 
clerical routine? Is the presumed and tacitly agreed upon 
demand for educational leadership merely so much ver- 
biage, merely traditional thinking? 
The work of the principal analyzed.—After all, the 
fundamental question is whether there is need for edu- 
cational leadership within the building, and not whether 
the principal should try to be an educational leader. 
Something may be gained by looking at the question 
pragmatically. What are actually the indispensable func- 
tions of the officer under discussion? These may be 
grouped under three heads: 
(1) Some duties now being performed by the principal 
are inherent in the situation and unescapable. They are 
duties which would not be performed at all, were they 
not performed by the principal. These duties belong to 
him but they are routine duties. They can be adequately 
performed by a person following directions and carrying 
out policies centrally initiated. 
(2) There are duties inherent in the fact that the 
school is located in a particular neighborhood; duties 
which, if not carried on by the principal, will not be 
carried on at all. These functions are perhaps not neces- 
sarily educational; but they require initiative and 
leadership. 
(3) Finally there are duties of local differentiation 
from an educational point of view, as for example, the
-P-A-G-E-105
PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF PRINCIPAL AND TEACHER 89 
development of an esprit de corps, the training of teachers 
in service, the improvement of instruction, and the adap- 
tation of general curricula and methods to local situations. 
' These duties are educational in character. But the 
ability of the principal to carry them on depends not only 
on his willingness and expertness; it depends also, first, 
on his being relieved from such routine as can be per- 
formed by another and, secondly, on his receiving scope 
to vary from the general policies laid down for the city at 
large. 
This grouping of activities into three types may, from 
the point of view of the principal and his available time 
and energy, be rearranged into two types of activities: 
(1) There are some things which he does because there 
is no one else to do them. The character of these activi- 
ties is such that any one might do them, a person less 
trained, less experienced, less mature. These activities 
the principal carries on because there is no one else on 
hand.!° (2) There are other types of work which can be 
done by the principal only. If not done by him, they 
will not be performed at all. 
In the past, the first group, involving many details and 
much routine labor, has probably occupied his attention 
to the exclusion of general educational leadership. If 
educational participation is not expected of him, it is 
right that he should find his way as best he can through 
the mass of details. If, on the other hand, it is right that 
his efforts should be given mainly to real educational 
leadership, then we should adopt the principle that the 
*” As this is being written, a good example comes to hand: Press 
despatches from Salt Lake City report that an elementary-school prin- 
cipal in that city was electrocuted in the basement of the school build- 
ing where he had gone to ascertain why the fires had not been started.

principal should not do anything, even though it be in- 
herent in the situation, which he can delegate to others. 
The most uneconomical thing that any institution or 
organization can do is to utilize trained efficiency for 
petty routine. If it is the business of the principal in 
fact to provide true educational leadership, then there 
should be given to him means of delegating clerical work 
as well as details of plant inspection and the unescapable 
discipline cases. 
One comes then squarely face to face with this prob- 
lem: Is there room for the principal as an educator in 
the American school system? Professor Bobbitt studied 
the school surveys to find an answer to this question as 
viewed by educational experts. He groups the “functions 
and relations of the principal as these are revealed in the 
survey reports”?! under a series of general headings, as 
follows: 
1. Direction of the work, as real educational head. This 
involves exercise of initiative, leadership in developing cur- 
riculum, and in the supervision of instruction, and in securing 
the codperation of the teaching force. 
2. Training teachers in service. 
3. Inspection of the results of teaching by studying (a) 
processes, and (b) objective results as measured by standard 
tests. 
4. Improvement of the work of the school by directing and 
advising teachers on the basis of the findings. 
5. Participation in the development of the general plans and 
policies of the entire school system. 
6. Codperation in general inspectorial labors, involving re- 
ports and other assistance to central authorities. 
7. Participation in choice of teachers, and in the selection 
of equipment.

PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF PRINCIPAL AND TEACHER 91 
This group of duties Professor Bobbitt classifies into 
three divisions—(1) clerical, (2) building routine, (3) 
those involving the technical ability of the educational 
specialist—and assumes that, the last being the only one 
primarily professional, assistance should be provided the 
principal for the first two types,:to relieve him for real 
educational work. 
II. Obstacles to Professionalization of Principals and 
Teachers 
But as we have seen, practice does not conform to these 
ideas. The reasons are deep-rooted in our general theory 
of school organization. It is accepted in America that 
the best division of authority between the lay Board of 
Education and its superintendent should be that modeled 
on a business corporation; namely, that the Board should 
confine itself to the development of general policies, 
leaving educational technical matters to the superintend- 
ent. This division of power seems to be correct in view 
of the fact that the Boards are not trained in education 
and are not devoting their time to the details of carrying 
on the schools. 
But the question may well be asked whether the com- 
parison with a business organization holds further. Fol- 
lowing the analogy, it is assumed that the superintendent 
is the only officer responsible for the development of 
educational policies, and he, therefore, in the typical 
American system occupies a purely autocratic position. 
“Tn respect to concentration of power and responsibility, 
no other type of educational position in America compares 
even remotely with the city and large-town superintend- 
ency, developed to the most generally and highly ap-
-P-A-G-E-108
92 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
proved degree. By contrast, the power of the university 
presidency, public or private, seems insignificant; its re- 
sponsibility, vague and indefinite.” 12 The city teaching 
staff are ordinarily chosen for specific functions, and are 
asked to perform them. 
But the question ought to be faced whether this type 
of organization is one best calculated to operate most 
fruitfully for the education of the youth of the land. 
School men are fond of comparing the management of 
education to the management of business, and usually 
to the disparagement of education. One frequently em- 
ployed method of indicating inefficiency in school man- 
agement is to indicate where it differs from what would 
go on in a business office. It is almost universally as- 
sumed that the analogy holds throughout, and that one 
of the best things that a school can do is to model itself 
on the methods of carrying on commerce and industry. 
The writer of a book on methods, for example, in his 
chapter entitled “Economy in Classroom Management,” 
states that “to avoid waste, principles of business man- 
agement should be applied in the classroom.” The cor- 
rectness of the analogy is, as usual, assumed. “If such 
principles of economy are important in factories, where 
the product that is wasted or economized is material, 
they are much more important in the school, where the 
product to be wasted or economized consists of human 
lives.” 
But is the analogy so complete as to be valuable 
always? Industry and commerce do not exist primarily 
for the purpose of operating efficiently. They exist for 
“FF. E. Spaulding, “The Superintendency as a Career.” School and 
Society, Vol. XV, p. 31.
-P-A-G-E-109
PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF PRINCIPAL AND TEACHER 93 
the purpose of producing profits for their owners. Effi- 
ciency is one of the phases of making the maximum profit. 
Fundamentally there is one interested party in the ulti- 
mate efficiency of commerce and industry; namely, the 
owner. The employees used as instruments in obtaining 
these profits have minor interests quite their own, i.e., the 
obtaining of salaries and wages. The ultimate interest 
is ordinarily not theirs, but that of their employers. 
On the other hand, it is, or ought to be fundamental 
in education that the persons employed in the process 
are all equally interested in the fundamental outcome— 
the education of youth. It would be hazardous to as- 
sume that their ultimate and-only interest is their own 
personal security and status in the educational system. 
When we adopt for educational organizations the factory 
system of manager and employees, of one person to think 
and others to obey, we are following an analogy that 
does not hold, and creating a well warranted restlessness. 
The teacher sent into the classroom to teach a curriculum 
that she has had no share in making is not an educator. 
Neither is the principal an educator, of whom it is ex- 
pected merely that he take orders and put into effect 
the ideas of the central authorities. 
One of the writers already referred to mentions a 
superintendent of schools who “stated that the greatest 
problem of the superintendent was that of knowing how 
actually to get things accomplished in the several schools 
in view of the fact that each school had a principal 
through whom the superintendent was obliged to work.” 
“This,” he states, “adequately expresses one conception 
of the relation of the principal to the central school au- 
thorities. All the wisdom is found at the center and the    
-P-A-G-E-110
    94 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
great problem consists in knowing how to get this wisdom 
to the circumference through these nonconductors—the 
school principals.” 1 This relationship is wrong, if only 
because the superintendent is not likely to be superhu- 
man. “The demands made upon thessuperintendent. [un- 
der the current system of the concentration of power and 
responsibility in the superintendency] are capable of 
satisfactory fulfilment only by supermen, not by even 
superior mortals.” 14 
But even if superintendents were supermen, what a 
pity to arrange to make the principals dwarfs and mes- 
senger boys. This they are in danger of becoming, so 
long as they lack the power without which they cannot 
achieve dignity. 
A new division of administrative powers is essential. 
—It is right that as between the lay Board and the educa- 
tional authorities, the Board shall confine itself to the 
adoption of general policies under the guidance of its 
expert educational staff; but it is wrong that this educa- 
tional responsibility shall be placed in the hands of a 
single individual. In our American democracy, main- 
taining schools for the education of the future citizens, 
the educational machinery is probably one of the most 
autocratic institutions extant. The school system as 
ordinarily organized does not provide for real educational 
work on the part of the vast majority of those employed 
in it. We have, it is true, arrived at the point where the 
superintendent no longer lays claim to educational omnis- 
cience. Some do now admit that principals and teachers

PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF PRINCIPAL AND TEACHER 95 
should be given scope for initiative, some are establishing 
the so-called teachers’ council, whose function it is to 
make representations to the superintendent and offer 
suggestions; but let it be noted that there has been no 
fundamental reorganization; there has been no distribu- 
tion of power. At the best we are at a point where advice 
is graciously listened to, but it is not in any way legally 
incumbent on the superintendent, the sole official exer- 
cising power, and responsible only to the Board, to ac- 
cept such advice. 
It is frequently asked why the schools have difficulty 
in attracting permanently more people of a very high 
caliber. One of the reasons is that they do not offer scope. 
They are too autocratically organized. Authority is far 
too centered. Principals and teachers are not permitted 
to be educators. “There is grave danger that the extreme 
concentration of power and responsibility in the superin- 
tendency, together with a logically consistent organiza- 
tion that extends this principle throughout the system, 
will tend to the development of-conditions that will make 
public educational organization even more effective than 
heretofore in its processes of repelling and dominating 
independence, self-confidence, and aggressiveness, and 
of attracting and holding dependence, passivity, and 
timidity.” 1° This is the opinion of an eminently suc- 
cessful large-city superintendent. 3 
If the defect is to be remedied, the educational powers 
now held by the superintendent must be shared with 
principals and teachers. It is not enough that the su- 
perintendent consent to hear teachers; he must give up 
the sole authority of ultimate decision. Education is not 
* Ibid., p. 31. 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
96 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
business. All of those engaged in the process have at 
heart the ultimate perfection of the product. Toward 
this end they cannot function if they are treated as mere 
employees, whose business it is to obey. Teaching will 
never be a fully dignified profession under such condi- 
tions. It is necessary that teachers and principals be 
represented as a parliament or congress, not simply to 
make suggestions, but to share in the making of ultimate 
decisions. The educational authority which the lay Board 
of Education rightfully refrains from exercising should 
be turned over not to one person, but to a body of educa- 
tors. This authority should be exercised not by one per- 
son but by a group representing the teaching personnel. 
The comparison that has been made of the present 
organization to a hierarchal or militaristic system is not 
fanciful. Says one leading American educational thinker: 
“Unqualified obedience is the first rule of efficient service. 
The classroom teacher owes this to his superiors, and 
whenever he cannot yield such obedience, his resignation 
is the only alternative.” And again: “the situation is 
entirely analogous to that in any other organization or 
system—the army, the navy, governmental departments, 
great business enterprises. . . . Concentrated effort can 
be secured in no other way. . . . Youth is prone to resent 
authority. Indeed, it is hardly too much to say that our 
contemporary theories of education do much, perhaps 
unconsciously, to inculcate an attitude antagonistic to 
authority.” 16 
Is this all true? Is it a correct analogy to compare the 
school to an army in which the general does all the think- 
ing, and so far as teachers are concerned it is “theirs not 
*W. C. Bagley, “Classroom Management,” Chapter XVII. 
   
-P-A-G-E-113
  PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF PRINCIPAL AND TEACHER 97 
to reason why, theirs but to do and die”? The arrange- 
ment would hardly seem to be democratic, or consistent 
with current conceptions of the dignity and significance 
of a profession. 
We have been speaking of the function of the principal, 
but the status of the teacher is quite analogous. It is 
too easy a theory to say, as the writer already quoted does 
say: “The superintendent demands these results of his 
principals, the principals pass on the demand to the class- 
room teachers, the classroom teachers exact the required 
work from the pupils. . . . Centralized authority, work- 
ing through intermediate officials, is the only known 
method of insuring economy of school administration in 
this respect.” 
Centralized authority there must be, but in a field in 
which all have equal interest in the outcome there ought 
not to be any government except with the consent of the 
governed. The tendency of autocratically organized 
school government is to rob the school force of dignity 
because it robs them of really professional function. 
It will be urged that the teaching profession as a whole 
consists of persons too young, too poorly trained, and in 
some respects too transitory to exercise and bear a share 
of ultimate educational responsibility. But suffrage does 
not imply the right to office. Although every one in 
America may vote on the attainment of a certain age, the 
right to become President of the United States is care- 
fully delimited in terms of further maturity, place of birth 
and of residence. While all teachers might share in the 
choice of representatives to the central body, the char- 
acter of the personnel so chosen could easily be limited, 
defined, and selected on the basis of age or training or
-P-A-G-E-114
  98 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
length of service within the system, or all of these com- 
bined. 
The educational powers and rights properly given up 
by the lay Board of Education should be exercised by the 
teaching personnel as a whole, acting in council, and not 
by one person. The superintendent may well have pow- 
ers, and large powers, but arbitrary and autocratic 
powers he should not possess. It should be possible, in- 
deed, if the sentiment is quite overwhelming, to over- 
rule the superintendent and to put into effect educational 
policies with which he is not in agreement. 
In business, losses are suffered by the same person or 
group of persons who gain by profits. In business the 
enterprise is privately owned and speculatively supported 
by wealth hazarded by such owners. In business, there- 
fore, it is proper that those owning a venture shall con- 
trol it. In business the persons employed in the course 
of the carrying on of the venture have no ultimate in- 
terest in it. That interest belongs to the employer. The 
personnel are employed as means to an end in which 
they do not share. Their interests are purely personal 
ones—the compensation for services rendered. This 
compensation they receive whether the venture goes well 
or ill. 
In war it is conceded as a result of centuries of experi- 
ence that the mass cannot be permitted to share in 
thinking out the campaign. It is agreed that they must 
entrust their personal welfare to central authorities, and 
that efficiency ultimately depends on unquestioning 
obedience. 
These situations are not analogous to the organization 
of the teaching personnel. Action based on the assump-
-P-A-G-E-115
  PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF PRINCIPAL AND TEACHER 99 
tion that they are so analogous is a ruinous fallacy, a 
fallacy that lies at the bottom of much of the inefficiency 
that the supervisory authorities now complain of. Prin- 
cipals and teachers must be given a share in the educa- 
tion of youth. The time has come to make the auto- 
cratic school superintendent a constitutional monarch. 
The method of the teachers’ council is only autocracy 
receiving counsel and not parting with power. 
III. A Theory of the Principalship 
What then is the function of the elementary-school 
principal? It ought to be clear from the foregoing that 
the primary difficulty in the way of formulating the 
function of the principal is the fact that he has really 
been carrying on with the superintendent a contest of 
power for the privilege of educational leadership. This 
contest has been an unequal one for two reasons: 
(1) The superintendent ordinarily has the power, if 
we may follow a happy business phrase, “to hire and to 
fire,” a power that tends to develop servility. The Amer- 
ican principal and teacher have ordinarily no vested 
interest in their professional career. They have no se- 
curity of tenure; they are the merest employees. 
(2) A second factor making this contest uneven lies 
in the fact that the American principal ordinarily has 
no professional consciousness as such. Almost never has 
he been specifically trained for his work. Almost always 
he is a promoted teacher, well accustomed to obedience 
and to taking instructions. The normal schools, the tra- 
ditional institutions for the training of teachers, have 
ordinarily made no provision for training school ad- 
ministrators. Indeed, it may be said again that in 
LIBRARY 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE COLLEGE 
MURFREESBORO, TENNESSEE
-P-A-G-E-116
  100 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
America there is no career of school administration. 
This office is usually made a means of rewarding good 
teachers, and good classroom teachers do not necessarily 
make good administrative officials. “Most principals have 
never had any systematic training for supervision. They 
were trained as teachers and for teaching. What the 
great majority of them have learned incidentally as to 
the technic of supervision is like most undirected inci- 
dental learning: it is fragmentary, ill-proportioned, and 
frequently erroneous. Usually principals are more in 
need of training in the technic of supervision than teach- 
ers are in the technic of teaching.” 17 
A democratic organization of education will ultimately 
make specific provision for the career of administration. 
Classroom teachers will be so well rewarded that adminis- 
tration will not lure as a mere means of advancement. 
Administration will draw persons particularly interested 
in that field. Such persons will develop a professional 
consciousness that will make their contribution to educa- 
tional discussion well worth heeding. 
The first great educational function of the principal 
under such an organization will.be the carrying of a full 
share of the general business of the education of children 
within the system of which he is a part. A second func- 
tion will be educational administration of one unit of the 
school in accordance with principles that the leader has 
helped to formulate and in codperation with a group of 
fellow workers who, too, have had their share in setting 
the goals and objectives toward which the system is aim- 
ing. That part of such local administration will consist of 
*F. Bobbitt, “The Building erasinal in the Surveys.” Elementary 
School Journal, Vol. XIX, p. 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF PRINCIPAL AND TEACHER 101 
improving teaching technic by group-study, by individual 
conference, by careful watching of young teachers, may 
all be taken for granted. That part of such administra- 
tion will consist of making adaptation to the particular 
needs of the neighborhood in which the principal is work- 
ing may also be taken for granted. 
To-day we have no established, worked-out and agreed- 
upon technic for the work of the principal because we 
have no such formulated ideas as to his function. When 
that function has been worked out with true conformity 
to democratic principles and to the demands of profes- 
sional dignity as well as complete professional function- 
ing, the principals will work out the technic of their 
office. 
Summary 
Between the teacher, whose function is clear, and the 
superintendent who is employed by the Board to be its 
technical adviser, to initiate policies, and to supervise 
their execution, the building principal holds an anoma- 
lous position. He obviously is engaged in necessary work, 
since some one must perform the tasks that fall to him. 
But is this work educational in character? 
The character of his duties and the degree of responsi- 
bility as between systems vary from mere obedience, to 
the privilege of suggestion, and the exercise of some dis- 
cretionary power not only because of the differences in 
opinion between superintendents, but because principals 
themselves do not agree as to the character of their func- 
tion. There is an amazing difference in practice as re- 
gards the duties performed and emphasized. Assuming 
that most of the work carried on must be performed by 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  102 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
some one, the question remains whether the principalship 
is an educational office. 
If the principalship is essentially an educational office, 
then we need standards by means of which to define its 
scope of activity and to measure performance. We need 
educational thinking and the formulation of a suitable 
theory. 
The principal performs three types of work. He does 
(1) some work which, though necessary, might be done 
by any one else, since it requires no educational training; 
(2) some work which, if not done by the principal, will 
not be done at all, since it grows out of the school’s local 
relations; (3) finally, real educational work within the 
school itself. 
Principals have heretofore stressed varying phases of 
these possible activities because no one individual can 
personally carry on all of them. Which work really be- 
longs to the principal cannot be determined until the 
point is settled whether or not he really is an educational 
official in the complete sense of that term. 
Assuming that the principal has educational work to 
do, he ought to be released for this work by having 
furnished for him assistance for every phase of the work 
which, though essential, is not educational in character. 
The principle ought to be that he should undertake no 
activity which might be as efficiently carried on by some 
one else. 
The claim is made in this chapter that there is room 
and need for the principal as an educational functionary, 
but that present school organization, centering, as it does, 
autocratic authority in the superintendent, makes it im- 
possible for the principal to be an educator. To place
-P-A-G-E-119
  PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF PRINCIPAL AND TEACHER 103 
him in a position to contribute initiative and leadership, 
the proposal is made that the educational power, properly 
given up by the lay Board should in part, at least, be 
exercised by the teaching personnel as a whole. 
Problems 
The question around which this chapter primarily 
centers is one involving the proper distribution and ex- 
ercise of the educational power possessed but not exer- 
cised by the lay Boards—power almost completely 
delegated to one person. A secondary question involves 
the determination of the function of a building principal 
and a technic for his office. 
Obviously, the solutions suggested may be wrong and, 
very likely, they are not those which*will finally be found. 
These proposals should, however, stimulate the student 
to participate in the discussion and the effort to solve the 
problem. 
The literature on this subject is neither extensive nor 
authoritative. Problems centering about the theme of 
this chapter would therefore, involve direct investigation 
of local school practice.

  CHAPTER VI 
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PHYSICAL WELFARE 
Enlarged meaning of education‘ The pedagogue,” 
says the Encyclopedia Britannica, “was a slave in an 
Athenian household who looked after the personal safety 
of the sons of the master of the house—kept them from 
bad company, and took them to and from school and 
the gymnasium.” In the course of history the meaning 
of the word pedagogy and the function of the pedagogue 
developed ever farther away from any idea of supervision 
over the physical welfare of the pupil, and became ever 
more restricted to his mental training. But a superficial 
glance over a well equipped school plant of to-day, with 
its provisions for recreation, for the care of the teeth, 
eyes, and the rest of the body, with its provisions for 
bathing, sleeping, and indced, feeding, makes one wonder 
whether the democratic community, replacing the master 
of the Athenian household, is not rehabilitating the words 
pedagogue and pedagogy in their ancient as well as an 
enlarged function. 
American communities to-day are taking a hitherto un- 
heard-of interest in, and spending hitherto unheard-of 
sums for the physical well-being of school children. That 
this interest in the physical well-being of the child is 
well grounded and that the expenditure of funds for that 
purpose is justified, is now so clear that it need no longer

be discussed in our democracy. The general aptness of 
that phrase of Horace, that has come down through the 
centuries, “Mens sana in corpore sano,” has always been 
admitted. But active attention to the demand involved 
in the theory is only just beginning. The reasons for the 
present social interest in the physical care of the child are 
obvious enough; they are implied in mass education with- 
in a democracy. These new school activities are the re- 
sult of an enlightened social philosophy which sees in 
the welfare of each individual, the ultimate welfare of 
the group. 
The comparative novelty of many of the movements in 
education is explained when we recall the recency of 
tax-supported, universal education itself. In the days of 
struggle for the establishment of the very school, refine- 
ments were not in place. To-day, with the basic prin- 
ciples established, the school is reaching out for qualita- 
tive improvement, and seeking to serve by enlarging the 
scope and significance of education. 
While all of the work to be discussed in this chapter 
began in progressive cities a number of years ago, recent 
events have helped to center attention upon conditions 
it is sought to remedy, and have given impetus and public 
support in that direction. The social survey auto- 
matically brought about by America’s entrance into the 
war has brought actual conditions vividly to the atten- 
tion of the country as a whole. Again, recent increase of 
knowledge in the field of hygiene, involving a great deal 
of technical information necessary in the nurture of chil- 
dren, is making the home an ever less competent agency 
for the complete care of the child. Urban conditions, 
modern industrial organization, poverty and ignorance
-P-A-G-E-123
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PHYSICAL WELFARE 107 
on the part of sections of the adult community, all tend 
to decrease the ability of the home best to care for the 
child. 
In accounting for the growing interest in physical wel- 
fare, one writer refers to the “startling and widely dis- 
cussed results of the experience of the army in examining 
recruits drafted for service and of three surveys; namely, 
that of the schools, showing a large percentage of chil- 
dren underweight; that of the insurance companies, in 
which the average span of good health is estimated to be 
only ten years; and that of the hospitals which brings out 
the fact that there are in the United States over three 
million people sick every day from causes largely 
preventable.” + 
Teaching as one phase of education.—It is interesting 
and important to note that teaching is rapidly becoming 
but one phase and coérdinate activity in the general 
process of education. There has heretofore been very 
little distinction between teaching and education. Edu- 
cation has meant to a very large extent the process of 
instruction. But the fact is that the process of carrying 
on public education is growing complex, and fairly divis- 
ible into a number of phases, of which teaching is one. 
The mental classification of pupils is the work of the 
psychologist. The derivation of the curriculum in gen- 
eral terms has become the work of experts, as is the work 
of objective measurements of the results of instruction. 
And so, too, the care of the physical well-being of the 
child is rapidly becoming a large, expensive, and highly 
technical phase of public education. Education and

108 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
  teaching are no longer synonymous. Education, indeed, 
is no longer the work of a single individual. Public edu- 
cation, which itself has heretofore been a phase of nur- 
ture, is rapidly becoming a great social function rather 
more coextensive with, than a part of, nurture, and the 
work of the teacher is becoming one part of this process. 
The method in preceding chapters has been to examine 
actual practice and to endeavor to derive and to es- 
tablish principles; but these chapters have dealt as the 
following chapters will deal with that part of education 
which is the business of the teacher. Special fields such 
as psychology, whose theory and technique are them- 
selves the subject of a voluminous literature, cannot be 
considered in detail. Practice in these fields is no longer 
properly in the hands of the teacher. Likewise, in this 
matter of the physical care of the child, it is not practical 
to follow the method of deriving sound principles for 
two reasons: First, it is a specialized, distinct, and tech- 
nical field in which the teacher will never be asked to 
become an expert. Secondly, work in this field is at the 
moment in a state of flux and development, and very 
few principles may be said to have been finally estab- 
lished. 
Yet it is desirable to picture modern practice in this 
important phase of public education, since ignorance 
of actual practice and ideals would hardly be excusable. 
Though they may not participate in them, teachers are 
vitally interested in all phases of the educative process. 
For these reasons the following pages tend to be descrip- 
tive, and to outline actual practice in progressive city 
systems. Concrete examples seem better suited to our 
purpose than general, detailed, and technical discussion
-P-A-G-E-125

in a field which in itself warrants a volume. In this 
chapter we substitute, therefore, in part, description for 
discussion. 
Whatever the ultimate classification may turn -out to 
be, it is possible and practical for our purpose to consider 
the work of the public school in the interest of the 
physical welfare of the child from three points of view, 
namely, plant, general health, and play. It is obvious, 
of course, that all three groups of work have health as 
their prime objective. It is clear, too, that there can be 
no hard and fast boundaries between these activities. 
They are closely interrelated and interdependent, all three 
converging toward the vigor, health, and happiness of 
the child. The groupings are arbitrary, being based 
rather on current administrative practice than on funda- 
mental principles, but they will serve our purpose. 
I. Plant and Equipment 
“Tt has been estimated,” states the Commissioner of 
Education, writing in 1910, “that this country spends ap- 
proximately seventy millions of dollars annually in the 
erection of public-school buildings,” ? excluding building 
for normal schools, colleges, and universities. In the na- 
ture of things, this sum is now much larger, and an ex- 
penditure of this size cannot be effectively made without 
a very specialized knowledge of modern sanitary tech- 
nique and educational requirements. A great deal of 
information has, indeed, been accumulated regarding the 
special requirements of schools. 
Books are available on the principles of school con- 
struction. Here we will content ourselves with an enu- 
meration of the topics discussed in a recent study of the

    school equipment of a large city,? and the description of 
a modern elementary school building in another city, 
primarily for the purpose of indicating to the uninitiated 
reader the character and extent of the information avail- 
able in this field. In discussing equipment, the survey 
referred to deals with location, playgrounds, lighting, 
blackboards, heating and ventilation, assembly rooms, 
basements, toilets, drinking fountains, fire prevention, 
janitor service, and lays down basic principles under each 
topic. 
“The school must serve a twofold purpose,” says 
Superintendent Cody, of Detroit, in his annual report— 
August, 1921—to the Board of Education; “first as part 
of the machinery by which children are made fit for good 
citizenship, and, second, as a community rallying point. 
To perform these functions successfully the school mus‘ 
be developed as a complete plant from a teaching, me- 
chanical, and landscaping standpoint. It must be attrac- 
tive to grown-ups as well as to children. It must be beau- 
tiful inside and out. The Board of Education,” he states, 
“has realized the social and academic importance of at- 
tractive interiors and pleasing exteriors, with plenty of 
room for playgrounds, lawn, shrubs, and flowers. After 
careful and serious study of this vital problem, there have 
been created, within the Department of Architectural 
Engineering, divisions of Interior Design and of Land- 
scape Gardening. In future planning no unit will be con- 
sidered complete until the interior is finished in pleasing 
color and the exterior is properly planted with sod, — 
shrubs, and proper plants. This will result in far more ~ 
effective and attractive school plants.”

II. General Health + 
The effort to prevent the spread of contagious diseases 
was probably the earliest motive and interest that brought 
the physician into contact with the school. The danger 
of spreading disease is increased in the community wher- 
ever people are gathered together in large groups, as is 
the case in school. This general obligation to protect 
children from the dangers inhering in the mere fact of 
their congregating in groups for many hours every day, 
is a corollary of compulsory education. 
Health work began, therefore, with the regular inspec- 
tion of children to discover early signs of infection so 
that children who represented a menace to the health of 
others might be eliminated. This work has become so ef- 
fective that, according to Dr. Alvin Powell, of the Oak- 
land Public Schools, “it is now generally conceded that 
there is less chance for the spread of children’s diseases 
in a city when the schools are kept open than when they 
are closed.” 
The solution of the problem of avoiding the spread of 
contagion has now become a single phase of a very much. 
more ambitious program for the health welfare of the 
pupil community. The general health program as now 
conceived is divided into (A) health promotion, (B) 
health protection, and (C) correction of defects. Each 
of these phases will in turn receive some consideration. 
A. Health promotion.—The primary method of pro- 
moting health is through education, involving as that 
does, not merely the giving of information, but the estab- 
_ ‘For valuable assistance in the preparation of this section, the writer 
is indebted to Dr. Alvin Powell, Director of the Department of Health 
Development of the Oakland, California, City Schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
    
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PHYSICAL WELFARE 113 
lishment of good habits. The discussion of the material 
and methods for teaching health principles has already 
assumed large proportions, and remarkable progress is be- 
ing made in the development of a very special technic. 
This is one field in which the demand that teaching shall 
function is most readily made. It is not enough that 
the child shall know; the school must devise means for 
inducing him to act on his knowledge. Physiology, 
anatomy, and hygiene as hitherto taught, are being 
altered in character. As formerly taught, these sub- 
jects have not functioned. In their place, the study 
of health and appropriate activities are being introduced 
in forms adapted to the ages of the children. In the 
program of Oakland, California, children for this purpose 
are divided into two groups as follows: grades 1 to 4; 
5 to6. 
(1) Gnrapzs 1 to 4.—“The child on entering school has 
little concern for matters pertaining to health. He lives 
largely in a world of the present with its keen joys and 
equally vivid sorrows.” The most that can be hoped for 
in these grades is that the child will form good health 
habits, and these are best encouraged through his in- 
terest in games, stories, songs, plays, and pictures. 
(2) Grapes 5 anp 6.—“It is important that the 
middle grade teachers make themselves very familiar with 
the work accomplished in the formation of health habits 
in the primary grades and continue along the same lines 
but necessarily from a different angle. The fairy story 
makes less appeal but there is greater interest in real 
stories.” These children are capable of applying knowl- 
edge. It is here that health facts can be taught in a 
serious way. For the accomplishment of these educa-
-P-A-G-E-130
j 
114 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
    tional ends, there have been prepared graded bulletins 
and outlines constituting a course of study which involves, 
incidentally, physical education, home economics, draw- 
ing, languages, arithmetic, hygiene, and general science. 
B. Health protection.—The work outlined above be- 
longs to the teacher. This group and the one that follows, 
are necessarily carried on in large part by physicians and 
nurses. Health-protection activities refer to routine 
work which is carried on constantly and which applies to 
all children. It is not the correction of gross conditions 
to be described later. It is not mere prevention, such as 
is involved in the fight to stamp out communicable 
diseases. It is affirmative health work which goes on hand 
in hand with formal education, to insure the physical 
future of every child. Five kinds of work fall under 
this head. 
(1) GeneraL sanitation.—This work involves sys- 
tematic inspection by the health department of the gen- 
eral sanitation of the schools and grounds. Frequent 
sanitary surveys of the entire school system are part of 
this work. 
(2) ScHoou reepine.—Every child in the Oakland 
Public Schools, to cite a concrete example, is provided 
with a mid-morning lunch consisting of an eight-ounce 
bottle of milk and a cracker or piece of bread. A charge 
of five cents is made. All children who are seven per 
cent. or more below the standard of weight for their height 
and age are provided with the mid-morning lunch with- 
out charge, if they cannot afford to pay for it.5 During 
the month of February, 1922, for example, there were 
*Funds for this purpose are at present provided by the Federation 
of Mothers’ Clubs and the Parent-Teachers’ Association.
-P-A-G-E-131
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PHYSICAL WELFARE 115 
furnished free to these children approximately five 
thousand bottles of milk. 
(3) Denvau servicr.—A certain—at present still in- 
complete—amount of dental service is furnished in the 
Oakland schools. This is not done with the intention of 
replacing the family dentist, or even of usurping the 
function of the regular relief agencies where attention is 
needed when parents cannot pay. The object of the 
dental work as at present carried on is rather intended to 
be educational and preventive in character, and aims to 
establish and strengthen good health habits. Examina- | 
tion and advice, cleaning, and a very limited amount of 
corrective work characterize this effort. 
(4) InpivipvaL EXAMINATION.—An examination, the 
results of which are properly recorded and filed at the 
central office as well as at the school attended by the 
child, is made of every pupil attending the Oakland 
Public Schools. The work is done codperatively by teams, 
on each of which there is a nurse, a dentist or dental 
hygienist, a physical director, a physician, and a clerk. 
The character and thoroughness of this examination may 
be indicated by a list of the points noted: age, height, 
weight, nutrition, posture, general appearance, skin, 
parasites, eyes, ears, nose, teeth, throat, neck, chest, 
heart, lungs, abdomen, vaccination. 
The object of this examination is twofold: In the 
first place it selects individual children for the special 
attention to be discussed in the following section. In 
the second place it supplies the central office with data 
regarding the health and physical status of the school 
population at large. This method of mass treatment of 
medical data is new and the benefit ultimately to be de-
-P-A-G-E-132
  116 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
rived is probably not yet fully realized. But even now, 
the medical director, with the data before him, can see 
where improvement is most needed, can learn whether 
children improve or decline as they grow older—by com- 
paring various age groups—and can study the effect of 
‘school conditions such as length of day and sedentary 
methods of instruction and of school equipment, such as 
light and type, on the general physical condition of grow- 
ing children. 
(5) EmercEency TREATMENT.—Finally, there may be 
mentioned, under the classification of protective work, 
the emergency aid given by nurses and physicians 
wherever possible. 
C. Health correction.—Perhaps the most important 
object of the general examination described above is the 
discovery of those children who are below normal in any 
respect, and therefore in need of attention. Such chil- 
dren are immediately brought to notice and work on each 
individual case is begun. In many cases some single, 
specific step is necessary such as tonsil operation, or the 
provision of glasses and, after this has been accomplished, 
the child may be lost in the mass until the next routine 
examination. In other cases, however, a long period of 
attention may be in prospect. 
In the case of this group of children, the routine pro- 
cedure provides for advice to parent and child by the 
physician, nurse, home teacher, or classroom teacher. A 
second examination, too, may be made by the neighbor- 
hood center physician—Oakland is divided for this pur- 
pose into eleven centers—who works in conjunction with 
the central office, and who comes in contact with and 
°These services are in Oakland paid for with funds provided by the 
Junior Red Cross,
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PHYSICAL WELFARE i117 
gives personal advice to parents. Ordinarily no treat- 
ment other than emergency aid is given at the neighbor- 
hood center. 
Finally, there is the group of children who have not 
been brought up to normal by this procedure, but who 
can be benefited by further attention. These children are 
brought in contact with local relief agencies of a medical 
character, or assisted in securing admission to appro- 
priate institutions. The Public Health Center of Oak- 
land, closely associated with the schools, conducts every 
type of clinic, including teeth and eyes, and makes pro- 
vision for some types of operation such as tonsils and 
adenoids. 
A preventorium, special nutrition classes, conservation 
classes for sight and hearing, open-air classes, and other 
forms of health work are considered appropriate school 
activities in the case of these children. 
III. Play? 
Modern physical education has two great aims: 
physical efficiency and good citizenship. To refer to the 
second objective first: 
A. Citizenship training.—Play is one of the deep hun- 
gers of child life—universal with all peoples and all ages. 
To the child it is life itself. It is the key which unlocks 
the most difficult problems of discipline; it is the key 
which unlocks untapped reservoirs of interest. It points 
to the golden opportunity of the teacher, by which she 
can place herself in sympathy with these vital issues of 
child life. The play yard, then, becomes a laboratory, 
‘For valuable assistance in the preparation of this section, the writer 
is indebted to Mr. Jay B. Nash, Director of Physical Education of 
the Oakland, California, City Schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  118 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
where these hungers are given expression. The restraint 
of the four walls of the schoolroom is off, the real self is 
loosened, and the opportunity for direction is unlimited. 
Good citizenship in children’s games, beginning with the 
simple games of the fourth grade which cuntain the em- 
bryo of teamwork, up through the games of basketball 
and football of the high school, calls for many of the same 
qualities as good citizenship in the State. 
B. Physical efficiency: sources.—The foundation of 
physical efficiency, which must become the basis not only 
of the recreation of the adult, but also of the work of the 
adult, is found largely in the play life of the child. This 
play life, involving vigorous exercise in the open air, alone 
can lay the foundation for body, mind, and soul to meet 
the rigors and strain of modern life. In this connection 
the word “play” must not be confused with idleness or 
amusement. 
Development comes through activity, so that remedial 
measures which correct bad posture and rectify bad habits 
are merely removing handicaps for the race of life and 
are in no way adding capacity. This capacity must come 
through activity, and from an activity which is pushed 
forward by the driving instinct of play. Play does not 
comprise the whole of physical education, but for the 
normal boy and girl in need of long hours of vigorous 
exercise which is driven by the instinctive hunger of the 
child, play must be considered the principal form of 
physical education. 
“For the development by maturity of a physical and 
moral efficiency and a disciplined citizenship, the follow- 
ing daily amounts of vigorous activity during the period 
of childhood and youth are necessary:” ® 
®See California State Manual on Physical Education.

This exercise must not be got from what we usually 
term “work.” It must be exercise which is impelled by 
a desire for joyous activity for its own sake. 
Finally, no program in physical education is complete 
unless a very definite set of proper carry-over habits is 
established in the lives of the boys and girls. Many chil- 
dren are physically sound upon graduation from school, 
but thereafter by slow degrees drop into sedentary habits 
which impair their efficiency. These carry-over habits 
will have to take the form of recreation which will be 
truly re-creation. This re-creation is not only a physical 
process, but a mental one as well. The great strain in 
modern life is mental rather than physical. If physical 
education fails to develop these carry-over habits, it has, 
to a large extent, failed in accomplishing the highest ideals 
of attainment. 
From the standpoint of physical efficiency, the follow- 
ing phases must, therefore, be given careful considera- 
tion: : 
(1) Big-muscip activiry.—By the activities of the 
big muscles themselves, and through the reaction upon 
the smaller and voluntary muscles and the organic proc- 
esses of the body, vigorous exercise will insure the growth 
and development of the boy and girl through the develop- 
ment of muscular strength, skill, and vitality, and through 
the development of nervous energy and capacity.  
-P-A-G-E-136
  120 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
(2) CREATION OF PHYSICAL HABITS THAT WILL CARRY 
OVER THROUGH LIFE AS WELL AS THE OUT-OF-SCHOOL HOURS 
OF THE CHILD.—By stressing games that the boy and girl 
will carry over, such as baseball, tennis, volley ball, and 
swimming, the school may assure habits of exercise 
through middle life. Related activities, such as camping, 
hiking, boating, gardening, and even hunting and fishing, 
should be encouraged from this standpoint. The great 
need for this play to furnish leisure-time activities for the 
children is seen when it is clearly understood that the chil- 
dren spend approximately a thousand hours per year in 
school, as compared with eighteen hundred hours on the 
street—this not including sleeping, eating, and short 
periods about the home. 
(3) RemovaL oF GROWTH HANDICAPS.—Under this 
head comes the removal of any handicap that will inter- 
fere with the growth and development of the child. The 
content here would vary from dealing with postural 
handicaps to psychic states. 
(4) TEACHING OF EFFICIENT LIVING.—Under this head 
are considered problems of proper weight and height, 
malnutrition, habits of personal cleanliness, sanitation, 
which would deal with the care of the home, school, or 
play yard; also problems of proper food, sleep, rest, exer- 
cise, fresh air, etc. 
C. Physical efficiency: methods.—It may be said 
that work for the development of physical efficiency is 
carried on in three forms: natural activities, athletic ac- 
tivities, and formal work activities. Each group will be 
described briefly. 
(1) Natural ACTIVITIES. 
a. Stunts—Stunts come under the type of activities 
in which one child challenges another in feats that require
-P-A-G-E-137
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PHYSICAL WELFARE 121 
courage and balance. They come under the “I-dare-you- - 
to-do-it” and “I-will-if-you-will” class. They were very 
prominent in connection with the farming life of this 
country, when children hung from rafters of barns, 
jumped into the haymows, chinned themselves, and did 
other individual feats. Those stunts can be made valu- 
able in modern schools if properly handled. 
b. Rhythmic activities—These rhythmic activities, 
which begin with simple rhythmic games of the “Did-you- 
ever-see-a-lassie?” type and at later stages develop into 
more complicated folk games, are designed to satisfy 
the individual’s hunger for rhythmic movements. The 
close codperation of the teaching of music and the teach- 
ing of physical education may, from this point of view, 
be of great value. 
c. Dramatic activities—These dramatic activities be- 
gin with the very simple imaginative story plays of the 
kindergarten. In these activities the children imitate 
. many adult activities and play activities of older children, 
such as climbing ladders, ringing bells, and picking fruit. 
These activities lead up to the simple interpretative plays 
and more complicated plays of older child life. 
d. Tag games—tThese activities include the great 
mass of traditional children’s games, in which one per- 
son is “it.” The games involve a great variety of hiding, 
seeking, and chasing elements. They are “social drama- 
tizations of situations which exercise racially old instinc- 
tive tendencies.” They also form the basis of a great 
many of the more complicated team games of later age 
periods. 
(2) ATHLETIC activitins.—These activities include 
the mass of games for older boys and girls which can be 
measured or scored. There is a great range of activity
-P-A-G-E-138
  122 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
under this head, which can be broadly placed in two 
classes: 
a. Individual activities—These are the activities in 
which an individual can compete by himself against time, 
space, or certain set standards. In the city of Oakland 
they include all the track events, swimming events, and 
decathlon events. 
b. Athletic games.—These activities include the games 
involving competition of two or more persons. There 
may be only one person on each side, as in tennis singles 
or handball; or there may be a team of two on each side, 
as in tennis doubles or handball. Again, there may be 
a larger group, as in basketball, soccer, or baseball. This 
includes, of course, the simpler games such as net ball 
and bat ball. : 
(3) Formal activities—These activities include the 
great mass of setting-up exercises, calisthenics, school- 
room gymnastics, as they have been variously called. 
This includes that type of mass work where one teacher 
handles a large number of individuals in formal set ex- 
ercises or drills. This type of activity has been greatly 
overdone during recent years—not only greatly overdone 
but very poorly done. Children are seldom interested in. 
this type of activity, the interest having to be aroused as 
a means toward an end. Properly handled, this formal 
type should show results in the following way: 
a. Muscular discipline—These exercises should de- 
velop the coérdination of muscles and insure a quick, ac- 
curate muscular response to command. This phase of 
activity is very important when properly handled. 
b. Muscular development.—A number of very valu- 
able exercises can be given to develop various sets of
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PHYSICAL WELFARE 128 
muscles which otherwise receive the minimum amount of 
exercise. 
c. Good posture-—The main object of these formal 
activities should be the development of good posture. 
Many elements of life unite to pull down the erect pos- 
ture of men. Not the least among these influences is the 
schoolroom furniture. The Provost-Marshal tells us 
that in the training camps of the last great war “slovenli- 
ness was one of the most outstanding, glaring faults of 
the American boy.” He further remarked that this 
slovenliness was reflected not only in the standing 
posture of the boy, but in his giving of commands and 
his taking of commands. It must be recognized that 
many of the more serious cases of bad posture go back to 
more serious causes, chief among which is probably mal- 
nutrition. In spite of this, the great mass of bad-posture 
cases are merely a matter of habit. In this phase of 
formal activity great stress should be placed on proper 
carriage of the body, proper standing, walking, and sitting 
habits. This problem cannot be handled by any special 
physical-education teacher, but must be a matter to which 
every teacher in the public schools gives attention. The 
posture cues should be sounded frequently in the class- 
room.

D. Physical efficiency: related activities—Under 
these related activities should be recognized many valu- 
~ able forms of physical-training activities. These activ-
-P-A-G-E-140
  124 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
ities include tramping, hiking, canoeing, rowing, bicycle- 
riding, camping, gardening, chores about the home. An 
example from actual practice in the schools of Oakland, 
California, may assist as an illustration of these principles 
in actual operation. In that city the work of physical 
education is organized in four periods, as follows: 
(1) Mornine 1nspection.—The morning inspection 
in the lower grades, which develops into the period for 
teaching of efficient living in the upper grades, is set 
aside as the period to teach neatness, personal cleanliness, 
and some of the simple, fundamental problems of public 
health. The principal means of attaining these results 
are through dict morning talks, inspection, small awards 
for rows having least demerits. Projects whereby the 
children arrange booklets on proper types of shoes, ad- 
vantages of fresh air, advantages of exercise, and life in 
the open are used rather extensively. A number of health 
plays such as “Mother Goose up to Date,” “The Theft 
of Thistledown,’ and “The Health Alphabet” have 
proved of great value. 
(2) Rewer periop.—The program for this period is 
designed to counteract the cramped, artificial conditions 
which must necessarily obtain in the classroom. It is 
arrangedias a period when the windows shall be open and 
a complete change of air obtained ;—a body-stretch, and 
then a return to work. 
(3) Instructionat PERIoD.—The instructional period 
is essentially a period for teaching and practising activi- 
ties suitable to the various age periods which will make 
for development, skill, and enjoyment in play. This is 
the period in which to arouse enthusiasm for universal 
efficiency; to instil in the child a love of activity; to
-P-A-G-E-141
  
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PHYSICAL WELFARE = 125 
arouse a pride in proper posture and efficient living. It 
is the time to establish habits of exercise that will become 
ingrained in the very fiber of the boys and girls. These 
habits should become so ingrained that they will remain 
with the child through high school, college, and later life. 
The elementary school is the vital formative period where 
health habits must be formed. 
This instructional period has become the key period 
of physical education. In this period are taught the 
principles of posture; the disciplinary and development 
values of formal activities; rules of games; organization; 
exercise for the relief period, and the skill and coérdina- 
tion of the various decathlon events. 
(4) Puay pPrrtop—This is the period for whole- 
hearted participation. It includes the period before 
school, noon, after school, Saturdays, holidays, vacations. 
In other words, the period includes all leisure time dur- 
ing school life or later life. 
IV. Basic Principles 
In the chapter on school extension, it was indicated that 
the failure of certain established agencies to continue their 
former functions, and that the ever increasing amount of 
specialized knowledge, which makes the parent ever less 
capable of caring for the child, are operating to broaden 
the scope of the meaning of education. Instruction it- 
self was in primitive times a function which the home 
and parents performed incidentally as a part of child- 
rearing. The time came when the complexity and 
specialization of knowledge required that instruction be 
carried on outside of the home by specially trained per-

  126 ~ THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
sons. In effect, this meant the removal from the home 
of one definite and important phase of nurture. 
When one looks at the modern school plant, which is 
prepared in part to care for the child’s food, sleep, and 
cleanliness, which takes care of his eyes, ears, teeth, and 
undertakes to build up his general condition in other 
ways, one is tempted to wonder whither this constantly 
increasing tendency to remove from the home the bur- 
dens of the care of the child may be leading. Are we ap- 
proaching the complete socialization of nurture for cer- 
tain sections of the community? This idea is hardly as 
startling as it sounds. The politically organized com- 
munity has already furnished complete care for large 
numbers of delinquents and defectives, while organized 
private enterprises are giving complete care to large 
numbers of dependents, and there is now heard the de- 
mand for so-called twenty-four-hour schools, intended for 
children whose home environment tends to endanger their 
future moral and social well-being.° 
After all, it is a fact that the accumulation of special- 
ized knowledge is making the care of childhood a 
technical function, for which few parents, indeed, are 
equipped, and it is doubtful whether it will ever be feas- 
ible to apply the advice of Herbert Spencer and teach 
to children at a time when they are uninterested in the 
matter “those activities which have for their end the 
rearing and discipline of offspring.” 
How far we have gone in this direction may be inter- 
estingly seen from the suggestion of Professor Gesell 1° 
°F. G. Nellis, vee awentyc taut Hour School,” The Journal of De- 
linquency, Vol. V, 117

THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PHYSICAL WELFARE 127 
that communities undertake for all children “a hygienic 
supervision of the pre-school period. This to result in a 
cumulative biographic record of every child from birth 
registration to school entrance. The data to be secured 
by the extension of present infant welfare agencies; by 
elaborated periodic measuring and weighing days; by 
organizing grammar grade and high school pupils to 
assist in the accumulation of these records; by widening 
the scope of public health, nursing and of medicine, so 
that the psychological and developmental interests of 
young children will be more definitely included.” 
Whether nurture is ever socialized or not, the time 
must come when it will be realized that the mere fact of 
parenthood does not in itself imply the ability to rear 
children, and when the state will undertake to supple- 
ment this lack of ability as a matter of mere justice to 
the children and to itself. While some American schools 
do now maintain day nurseries, the trend in this direc- 
tion has gone much farther abroad, where a technique is 
being worked out in the public care of children beginning 
at a very tender age.11 
Certainly no one will question the high mission of the 
home as the supreme medium for the development of 
childhood, but there always are homes not so well suited 
to the welfare of the child as other means of nurture, and 
socialized nurture need not mean institutionalized nur- 
ture. One can imagine socialized nurture by means of 
supervision of suitable homes. 
The same tendency that operates to make existing in- 
stitutions less competent because of the accumulation of 
™See Margaret McMillan, The Nursery School. (Dutton, 1921.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
128 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
    knowledge tends also to an ever-narrowing of functions. 
It is a commonplace that this is an age of specialization. 
Increase of knowledge and growing complexity and 
thoroughness of technique mean a division of the fields 
of labor in education as elsewhere. Increasing informa- 
tion, increasing division of function, specialization with- 
in a given field; this is the continuous modern progress 
in every division of human endeavor. 
In education, for example, the teacher is no longer ex- 
pected to be a psychologist. Until the advent of modern 
psychology and its practice by specialists who limit them- 
selves to this field, the unusual child fared very poorly at 
the hands of the generally trained teacher. It is not so 
very many decades since “the idle fool was whipped at 
school.” To-day he is the subject of a great deal of study 
which is resulting in the reorganization of educational 
methods. Speech defectives, too, to mention another in- 
stance, suffered tragically for many a century until the 
arrival of the specialist who is devoting himself to their 
particular need. Methods for the exact measurement of 
the efficiency of instruction are now in the hands of spe- 
cially trained experts who rarely participate in actual 
teaching. And so it is with this latest development of 
public education, the thoroughgoing physical care of the 
child. Teachers have always admitted the aptness of 
the doctrine “A sound mind in a sound body,” yet modern 
efficient care did not develop out of the teaching person- 
nel, but as the result of application and study on the part 
of specially trained individuals. 
Inadequacy of the local unit school of control_—_No 
phase of modern educational development shows more 
clearly the futility of the one-teacher school than the sub-
-P-A-G-E-145

ject about which the discussion of this chapter centers. 
Modern education has totally outrun the one-teacher idea. 
In a world of specialists, the one-teacher system is less 
useful than ever before. The movement for so-called con- 
solidation, too, while still under discussion in remarkably 
conservative communities, has now been antiquated 
before its enactment in these communities. After all, 
consolidation means larger single schools, and these are 
in no position to afford the equipment and personnel 
necessary for the modern physical welfare of children. 
And so, too, the average rural county in the most 
progressive States from the point of view of organization, 
will probably find itself inadequate as a unit for the 
adoption of the best practice in medical inspection and 
care. 
Possessed, as we are, with knowledge, technic, and 
adequate procedure in the physical care and development 
of children, it seems wasteful to reserve this knowledge 
for children in cities alone. It seems unreasonable that 
in spite of the fact that information and methods exist 
and are available, an antiquated system of organization, 
historical in origin and not based on any carefully derived 
theory, should deprive millions of children of their proper 
participation in the benefits to be derived. Every advance 
in modern educational ideas serves to emphasize anew 
the amazing disparity that exists in America between 
urban and rural communities. While the best American 
practice is probably excelled nowhere in the world, the 
application of this practice is unwarrantedly restricted to 
small geographical areas and to a minority of the child 
population. The ever growing complexity and expensive- 
ness of modern education, as well as its constant tendency  
-P-A-G-E-146
130 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
to specialization, which increases the number of persons 
necessarily involved in a unit for its most perfect func- 
tioning, indicates the inevitable adoption of the State as 
the ultimate unit for public-school organization and 
control. 
Summary 
Given additional impetus by the disquieting disclosures 
brought out by the systematic survey of physical well- 
being during the War, the movement for extensive care 
for the physical development of children as a definite 
task of public education, is becoming widespread and well 
established. 
The need for this work, and the decreasing efficiency of 
the home to carry it on, are bringing to the school a group 
of activities so large in scope, and requiring for excel- 
lence in supervision so much specialized training, that 
teaching is slowly taking its place definitely as one phase 
of, rather than being as heretofore coextensive with, 
education. 
The work of the public school in the interest of the 
physical welfare of the child may be considered under 
three groups of activities: plant, health, and play. 
Hygienic working conditions are fundamental. Gen- 
eral health work consists principally of three forms of 
endeavor; namely, health education, health protection, 
and correction of defects. Play is the foundation stone 
of general physical education. As carried on in progres- 
sive schools, this work includes certain natural activities, 
athletic activities, formal activities, and non-curricular 
related activities. 
It seems that the school, which in the first place re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PHYSICAL WELFARE 131 
sulted from the obvious inadequacy of the home to carry 
on certain phases of nurture now conventionally regarded 
as its particular sphere, is about to enlarge its scope and 
relieve the home of still more responsibility. 
The need for specially trained persons in each division 
of the work for the physical welfare of children illustrates 
once more the growing inadequacy of local unit control 
to meet the educational demands of to-day. 
Problems 
Practice in the work discussed in this chapter is not 
final. At every point the student may find, either in the 
literature or in the local schools, divergent opinions. 
Fundamental, final principles are still problematical. 
Details are avoided in the foregoing discussion, but 
unavoidable in practice. The direction of classroom 
lighting and height of windows, the comparative value 
of various heating and ventilating systems, the degree of 
undernourishment and muscular underdevelopment that 
should single the child out for special attention, the 
amount of playground space per pupil—these questions 
are typical of scores of problems that might occupy the 
student in the field of education covered by this chapter.

  CHAPTER VIT 
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 
I, Compulsory Education Legislation 
The right of the State to compel attendance.—It is 
apparent that increasing socialization of common activ- 
ities under the leadership of the State always involves 
the limitation of the rights of the individual. Laws gov- 
erning the safety, sanitation, and working conditions of 
factories, or the compulsory insurance of employees, or 
the minimum age for the employment of children, modify 
individual freedom in every instance in the interest of 
the group as a whole. It is so with compulsory education. 
Inevitably, legislation requiring parents to send their 
children to school limits the rights of these parents with 
regard to the control of their own children} Obvious 
though this may seem to us, it has not always been so. 
The right of the parent over the child has in some ages 
and in some civilizations almost approximated our present 
concept of property rights. 
This right of the State to compel school attendance is 
now so well established in America that a theoretical dis- 
cussion of its basic soundness would be a waste of space.* 
+ And yet a note in School and Society for March 18, 1922, records 
the fact that the Amish bishops of Geauga County, ‘Ohio, entered 
protest against the provisions of the compulsory education law of 
that State. School “separates their interests from the farms,” com- 
plained the bishops. ey

  134 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Within the century we have traveled the path from al- 
most no educational provision to compulsion, by the 
stages of non-governmental philanthropic provision, the 
struggle to induce the State to provide even the rudi- 
ments of education, complete provision for education 
through at least eight grades, and at last actual com- 
pulsion in every State requiring that children take ad- 
vantage of the opportunities provided, for a number of 
years. 
The character of this compulsion in the several States. 
—The degree of compulsion as represented by the number 
of years required, and the proportion of each year which 
the child must attend school, are almost as varied in 
American States, as is the very school opportunity itself, © 
and the character of the efficiency of the American 
schools. The struggle for adequate compulsory education 
legislation and for the effective administration of such 
legislation must be carried on, not so much against the 
inability of the community to support schools, or against 
its unwillingness to provide some opportunities for every 
class of children, as against those private interests, which 
in some sections of the United States seem to feel that 
the industrial well-being depends to-day almost as much 
on the exploitation of the labor of children as it once did 
on that of slaves. 
Against this determined opposition to the extension of 
education in certain sections of the country, even Federal 
legislation brought about by agencies which are deeply 
interested in the welfare of children, has so far proved 
ineffective. Two statutes enacted by the American 
Congress under the interstate commerce clause of the 
Federal Constitution have in turn been declared uncon-
-P-A-G-E-151
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 185 
  stitutional, as a result of litigation initiated by these 
interests. 
In a recent study made by the Federal’ Children’s 
Bureau ? of conditions in the sugar-beet fields of Colo- 
rado, it was found at the time the study was made that 
1077 children under sixteen years of age were employed 
in the area under investigation—parts of two counties. 
Four-fifths of the children were under fourteen years of 
age, more than one-fourth were under the age of ten 
years, and a number had not reached the age of eight. 
The educational handicap of the beet-working children 
was shown by the fact that more than forty per cent. of 
those between the ages of nine and sixteen included in 
the study were from one to seven years behind in their 
grades. School records indicated that the progress of 
these children was inferior by 25 to 35 per cent. to that 
of the unemployed children attending the same schools. 
That no section of the country is unanimous in a point 
of view which favors depriving children of educational 
opportunities, may be noted from the following comment 
of the Bristol (Virginia) Herald Courier on the decision 
of Judge Boyd, declaring the second Federal law 
unconstitutional: 
“Humanity called for the enactment of such a law so 
that children of tender years might have their days in 
which to play and grow and acquire the rudiments of an 
education. Whenever such an enactment was proposed 
by the legislature of any State, in the South especially, 
the mill men of the State would hurry to the capital to 
protest and to urge with all the influence in their power 
that it would mean their ruin, unless a similar law were 
?Summarized in School and Society, Vol. XIV, p. 454.  
-P-A-G-E-152
136 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
  enacted in States with like manufactories. This method 
was successful, until its proponents brought the matter 
up in Congress, and then their winning argument was 
gone, for the law applied to all States alike. Undoubt- 
edly the present law may be cured by amendment 
wherever it conflicts with the fundamental law of the 
land . . . and children everywhere in this country will 
be protected from industrial slavery and no longer be 
coined into unholy profit for rapacious manufacturers.” ® 
Length of the compulsory period.—It may be said in 
general that the present American tendency is to make 
school attendance compulsory from age seven or eight 
to age sixteen.t Some thirty-five States now set age 
sixteen as the period up to which the child shall attend 
school, although in almost every instance exemption is 
provided for children who have attained a certain min- 
imum of education, and whose assistance is urgently re- 
quired. Other States set even higher standards: Maine | 
and North Dakota require attendance to age seventeen. 
Utah and Oklahoma set the age as high as eighteen, the 
latter requiring completion of the eighth grade as a con- 
dition precedent to exemption from school attendance 
below that age. 
Some of the States have provided for compulsory 
continuation work up to age eighteen for persons who 
have not reached certain standards above those required 
for exemption from full-time attendance, and even a 
higher age for persons who are totally illiterate. An in-

teresting example of the current tendency in progressive 
States—an extreme provision whose wisdom may, indeed, 
be questioned—is the requirement of the State of Utah 
that alien adults who do not possess such ability to speak, 
read, and write English as is required for the completion 
of the fifth grade, must attend evening school so long as 
they are under age forty-five. 
As against this advanced legislation it is to be noted 
that the State of Arkansas requires attendance only to 
age fifteen, while attendance up to age fourteen is still 
provided for in Delaware, the District of Columbia, 
Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, 
Texas, Mississippi, and Wyoming. 
Modifications of the requirements.—But the length of 
the compulsory period alone, is an insufficient index to 
the character of the compulsory school legislation of any 
State. Assuming, for the moment, the efficient and bona 
fide administration of the law, two important modifying 
factors must be considered: The minimum amount of 
attendance required within each year, and the provisions 
for exemption from the operation of the law—some such 
provisions are always found—are factors which may nul- 
lify apparently satisfactory statutes. 
The mere fact of the number of years required is not 
a sufficient index of the character of any compulsory law. 
In order completely to understand the effectiveness of 
such a law, even assuming completely efficient enforce- 
ment, one must examine the minimum attendance re- 
quired within each year. In the State of Georgia, for 
example, which provides for six compulsory years of 
schooling—from eight to fourteen—the minimum re- 
quirement is six months. The total compulsory period
-P-A-G-E-154
  138 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
of education is therefore thirty-six months, a period of 
time which in ordinary city schools means four years of 
elementary-school education. But this minimum is ex- 
celled in South Carolina, which in the same six-year 
period provides for a minimum attendance each year of 
eighty days. The multiplication of eighty by six indicates 
that the minimum requirement of education for children 
in that State consists of four hundred and eighty days. 
Judged by standard cities, which consider two hundred 
teaching days the minimum for one year, the State of 
South Carolina provides a compulsory period of less than 
two and a half years of standard instruction for its chil- 
dren. Even judged by the lower standard of the country 
at large in which “the average term provided is 160.7 
days” > South Carolina demands of its children a degree 
of education equivalent to the completion of the third 
grade. 
The State of Mississippi now has legislation requiring 
attendance from ages seven to fourteen, and makes this 
same maximum provision of eighty days’ attendance, but 
provides a means whereby individual counties may ex- 
empt themselves from the operation of the law. Four 
counties, two of them bearing the names of Franklin and 
Jefferson, have so far, by ballot taken within the county, 
availed themselves of this privilege.* Even this state 
of affairs seems to be an advance in the State of Missis- 
sippi; for in the school year of 1917-18 Mississippi’s 
attendance requirements were still limited to forty days 
instead of eighty as at present.”

  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 139 
The State of Maryland, outside of Baltimore, requires | 
attendance at school between the ages of seven and thir- 
teen; and the State of Virginia between the ages of eight 
and twelve. In this State the number of weeks of attend- 
ance required within each of the four years is sixteen, a 
number which, even assuming that there are no school 
holidays and that the child is actually subjected to in- 
struction on every school day of every one of the sixteen 
weeks in every one of the four years during which he is 
compelled to attend school by law, makes a total of three 
hundred and twenty days—time sufficient to attain 
second-grade efficiency, judged by the average length of 
_term in the United States, and less than is required to 
attain such efficiency in standard American cities, which 
consider two hundred days of actual teaching a minimum 
school year. 
While it is clear that the Federal government will prob- 
ably never control the actual conduet of education in the 
United States, it seems equally certain that the time has 
arrived when its influence should be extended in the direc- 
tion of equalizing, to some extent at least, the school 
opportunities of American children. The variation in 
quality of opportunity offered, between that available 
in the most progressive cities and that to be secured in 
the rural counties of some of the Southern States, ought 
no longer to be totally ignored. In many instances the 
grounds for exemption are so numerous and so liberal as, 
in effect, to nullify the law. 
Five basic problems of compulsion—We have been 
discussing the compulsion which the State brings to bear 
*See J. A. H. Keith and W. C. Bagley, The Nation and the Schools. 
(Macmillan, 1920.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
    140 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
upon the individual and, in addition to the disparity of 
opportunity inherent in our type of political organiza- 
tion, we have noted these problems: (1) How many 
years shall the child be required to go to school? (2) On 
the assumption that the law should not be applied equally 
to all children, under what conditions shall some be ex- 
empted from its operation? (3) What number of days or 
weeks shall constitute a minimum school year? Two 
other problems may be noted: (4) Shall compulsory edu- 
cation be State-wide in its operation, or shall local com- 
munities within the State be allowed to modify the law— 
either by adopting compulsory legislation or exempting 
their territory from such provisions? (5) How shall the 
law be enforced as against both recalcitrant parents who 
do not send their children to school, and recalcitrant com- 
munities which do not provide school facilities in com- 
pliance with the State law? 
Two basically different methods of control.—All of 
these five problems are of fundamental importance. 
None of them have been settled in America with any de- 
gree of finality. Their solution is nominally in the hands 
of persons without the technical experience and training 
to settle them—the legislatures of the various States. 
Without going into the details of governmental science, 
it may be pointed out that there are two possible methods 
of governmental control. Under one method, the legis- 
lature creates a corporate commission to manage or super- 
vise a set of human relations of great intricacy, and gives 
this commission broad discretionary powers, which are, 
in effect, powers to legislate as occasion may arise. The 
Public Utility Commissions of the various States are 
examples of this type of legislation. They have the
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 141 
power to make, modify, and annul rulings as situations 
arise. This type of control has at least two outstanding 
advantages: Provision is made for flexibility and ready 
adjustment to situations as they arise, and arrangements 
are made for the employment of technicians and experts 
who are in a position to give advice of an exact ‘profes- 
sional character to those charged with administration. 
It is obvious that the Congress of the United States, 
from which the Interstate Commerce Commission de- 
rives its power, would find itself incapable of carrying 
on effectively the work of that Commission. 
On the other hand, there is the type of legislation 
which undertakes to provide in detail, once and for all, 
a set of regulations covering all contingencies that may 
arise. Where the situation to be dealt with is simple 
and clear-cut, as for example, the salary to be paid to 
the governor: of the State, the legislation is effective. 
Where the situation to be dealt with is complicated, as 
for example compelling children to attend school, such 
legislation is in the nature of things, ineffective. The 
fundamental cause for this ineffectiveness is found in 
the fact that whereas legislation tends to be uniform, life 
tends to be complex. The legislature, for example, with 
great ease and apparent clarity passes an act requiring 
all children to attend school from age seven to age six- 
teen. But the facts in the case are that a totally deaf 
child cannot be given the rudiments of education in that 
period, and for him the compulsory age should be higher, 
whereas a low-grade moron has little to gain by staying 
in school so long, in many cases his presence there repre- 
sents a menace, and for him the period might well be 
shorter—he should become a producer at an earlier age.
-P-A-G-E-158
  142 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
There is little object in urging the legislature to change 
the law. In the first place the process is slow; in the 
second place it involves a preliminary period of educating 
the legislature; in the third place there are not always 
at hand public-spirited groups to devote time and energy 
to initiating legislation and lobbying for it; and, finally, 
by the time the legislation is enacted it may be anti- 
quated. Scientific information may be just one step 
ahead. 
Less legislation, more discretionary power.—There is 
too much educational legislation on the statute books of 
the American States, and the legislation regarding com- 
pulsory education is an excellent example of it. Every 
statute in the country shows distrust of the regulations 
contained therein, by numerous provisions for exemption. 
The provisions are detailed. In some instances they 
operate unjustly where indulgence would not be neces- 
sary. In some instances they fail to meet situations 
where indulgence would be just. We need, in the place 
of detailed legislation, expert commissions or boards with 
broad discretionary powers and facilities for the employ- 
ment of experts and for the making of flexible changes 
to meet situations as they arise. Education is a compli- 
cated process whose principal characteristic is the absence 
of uniformity in children and in procedure. Legislation of 
a general character is necessarily uniform. | Less detail 
in the laws and more discretion in the hands of State 
Boards will undoubtedly tend to speed educational ad- 
vancement.) In the field of education, administrative 
Boards and officers should be charged not so much with 
enforcing laws as with improving education. Changes 
and modifications to conform to new situations and new
-P-A-G-E-159
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 143 
ideals should be made easily, rapidly, on the advice of 
experts—without invoking the cumbersome processes of 
legislation. 
Sound principles for compulsory education regulation. 
—We may now return to our five problems; namely, (1) 
the number of years the child should be required to at- 
tend school; (2) what differences should in this regard 
be made between children; (3) what number of days or 
weeks shall constitute a minimum school year; (4) 
whether compulsory education shall be State-wide in its 
operation; and (5) how the law shall be enforced as 
against recalcitrant parents and communities. 
With the question of enforcement—the fifth problem 
noted—we shall deal in the section that follows. The 
fourth problem would seem to require little discussion. 
Shall compulsory education be State-wide in its operation, 
or shall local communities within the State be allowed 
to modify the law—either by adopting. compulsory legis- 
lation or exempting their territory from such provisions? 
The privilege of local option in education, a privilege 
exercised in many States, and in each direction—both to 
extend the period or provide for compulsion, and to ex- 
empt the community from the operation of the law— 
seems, on the face of it, unwarranted. Evidently these 
provisions represent the price paid for permission to 
enact the law. On the face of things this legislation 
seems vicious and unwarranted, deliberately aggravating 
within the States inequalities already existing on the 
basis of uneven distribution of wealth and the geographic 
and population unevenness of the local districts of school 
control. 
We come then, to the first three problems: How many
-P-A-G-E-160
144 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
  years shall the child be required to go to school? An 
examination of the statutes shows a general feeling that 
the longer the period, the better the provision. But ac- 
curate information as to the ultimate goals desirable, on 
which to form a scientific basis for the regulations, is 
lacking. The most advanced statutes are based on hu- 
manitarian rather than scientific ideas. Regardless of all 
other differences, they always have this in common— 
they operate uniformly, and affect all children alike. 
But the question may very well be raised whether uni- 
formity of treatment is the best way of handling the 
compulsory education problem. The constitutions of the 
States usually contain provisions against what is known 
as “class legislation,’ so that statutes, to be valid, are 
required to be non-discriminatory. But nature is not 
bound by any such limitations, and the race is not charac- 
terized particularly by identity of endowment either men- 
tal or physical. 
In simpler ages, when less discrimination was necessary 
or, indeed, possible, uniform legislation was less obviously 
out of place. But to-day, when we can with some degree 
of accuracy grade the population from idiocy to very high 
endowment; when the deaf, the blind, the crippled, and 
the anemic, the potentially delinquent and the genius, re- 
quire differentiation of educational treatment each on 
the basis of his own handicaps and advantages, uniform 
non-discriminatory legislation which carefully observes 
the constitutional prohibition against class legislation 
will seem about as apt as would uniformity of provision 
in the size of shoes or of diet. 
The very lack of uniformity of conditions and require- 
ments with the consequent demand for adaptation, calls
-P-A-G-E-161
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 145 
for less legislation and more power in administrative 
boards. Such a question, for example, as the length of 
the compulsory period involves a detailed study of the 
time for admitting children to school. Age six is the 
merest tradition. Some children are ready for school at 
an earlier age, and others should not enter until later. 
There are better criteria for school readiness, and these 
will have to be discovered. : 
It is obvious that there are certain discoverable factors 
operating in determining the child’s readiness to enter 
school. These are of at least two kinds, physical and 
mental. On the physical side, there is necessary at least 
a certain degree of stamina which will in future be some- 
what exactly determinable in terms of physiological age, 
. and the possession of certain habits that make the child 
able to care for himself in the group. On the mental side, 
it is necessary that the child shall have attained speech, 
the ability to act with a group larger than the family 
circle where he has been receiving undue attention and 
indulgence, that he shall have attained a certain mental 
age, and, in general, that he shall have reached the end of 
the period of effective home training and education. 
Whatever else may be said of these factors, it is at least 
clear that they do not operate uniformly. The very large 
proportion of all first-grade children who fail of pro- 
motion proves the point. Some scientific basis for the be-~ 
ginning ,of school must be determined, more useful than 
the easily administered criterion of chronological age. 
Practically the same lack of uniformity characterizes 
the other end of the compulsory-age period. How long 
shall children stay in school? The naming of one age 
applicable to all is too easy a solution. From the physio-
-P-A-G-E-162
146 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
logical point of view, what is the number of years dur- 
ing which every child should be free from participation 
in productivity? From the economic point of view, for 
how long a period can our society afford to provide leisure 
for youth, to serve as a period of preparation? From the 
point of view of the duration of human life, what is the 
period beyond which preparation, even for the most 
highly endowed, begins to pay diminishing returns, be- 
cause of the shortness of the effective productive period 
of living that remains? From the psychological point 
of view, what is the effective period for each of the classi- 
fications? This consideration obviously lends itself to 
discrimination. A fixed period may be wasteful for the 
very dull and too short for the very bright. Uniformity 
in the face of patent discrepancy of nature is not de- 
mocracy; it is stubborn conservatism. Democracy re- 
quires equality of opportunity. Equality of opportunity 
means scope for utilization of ultimate capacity. A uni- 
form period which is too long for the dull and too short 
for the gifted is about as democratic and just as a sym- 
phony concert that is not finished, but is open equally to 
the deaf and to the hearing. 
Legislatures are not in a position to settle these ques- 
tions. They belong to the educational profession. Their 
solution should never be final and binding until changed 
through cumbersome processes. Administrative bodies 
should regulate them and maintain flexible rules, re- 
sponsive to the advancement of knowledge. 
Minimum School Year.—What number of days or 
weeks shall constitute a minimum school year? Here 
again we face complicated questions which no set of 
legislators can answer and which, no matter by whom an-
-P-A-G-E-163
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 147 
swered, should not be finally settled in fixed forms diffi- 
cult to alter. Ultimately the answer will depend on the 
amount of time found to be necessary for the accomplish- 
ment of the work set. The length of the school year, 
which may differ for different sections of the school popu- 
lation, the length of the vacations, the length of the 
school day and the length of the effective period of in- 
struction, are at present largely unsolved problems. 
II. The Administration of Compulsory Education 
We come finally to the problem of the administration 
of the statutes as they exist. Compulsory education 
legislation has two distinct phases: It is directed against 
the individual, who ig required to avail himself of the 
opportunities offered; it must also be directed against 
the local communities, which in America actually con- 
trol, provide, and maintain schools. Legislation directed 
toward the individual would be of no avail if the local 
community failed to comply with the statutory require- 
ments in the matter of providing minimum educational 
facilities. Investigation would probably disclose that 
educational authorities in the American States have not 
been extraordinarily alert in the compulsion of reluctant 
school districts. Much is to be desired in this direction. 
Indeed, complete compliance with compulsory education 
laws will probably never be brought about until their 
administration becomes a State-wide function directly 
carried on by State authorities. 
It is clear that mere legislation rarely insures execution 
of statutory provisions. There are many so-called “dead- 
letters” on the American statute books. Very frequently 
non-governmental agencies are alert in compelling the 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  148 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
ordinary authorities actually to enforce laws, which with- 
out their urging might remain mere form. In America 
many child-welfare agencies interest themselves in the 
enforcement of laws respecting children; but these agen- 
cies find it impossible to function within every State and 
within every district. 
State-wide enforcement machinery essential.—There 
has ordinarily been provided no means of enforcement 
outside ‘of the actual school district, and within a dis- 
trict it has usually been left to the school authorities 
to see to the compliance with the law, City school dis- 
tricts, and in rural communities organized on the county 
unit plan county boards of education, have been more or 
less efficient in enforcing compulsory education laws; but 
districts which are not particularly interested in the en- 
forcement of such laws have been left almost without 
pressure except in so far as the distribution of State funds 
is almost everywhere made on the basis of actual attend- 
ance rather than mere school population. 
This discrepancy in (the enforcement of the law even 
within given States ought to be eliminated by making 
the enforcement of the law definitely a State function.) 
The status of compulsory school law enforcement may be 
noted from the following quotation taken from a recent 
statistical study: “Twenty States have over one-fifth 
of the children of school age out of school. . . . In one 
State, Louisiana, forty per cent. of the children are not 
enrolled in school.”® These figures take on an even 
worse aspect when it is recalled that cities are ordinarily’ 
more efficient than rural districts in bringing the chil- 
dren into the schools. The percentage for country dis- 
°US. Bureau of Education Bulletin, 1920, No. 11, p. 7.
-P-A-G-E-165
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 149 
tricts is quite probably greater than that quoted. It is for 
the sake of the children in rural communities particularly, 
that State-wide compulsion should be directed both 
against the local communities, compelling them to com- 
ply with minimum legal requirements and against parents 
and guardians, compelling them to give children the mini- 
mum benefits provided by law. Control merely by 
distribution of State funds is not enough. (The establish- 
ment of State-wide administrative machinery for enfore- 
ing the compulsory education law is to-day one of the 
most urgent needs in the nation-wide effort to eliminate 
illiteracy, to raise the general standard, and to exploit 
the resources of intelligence. ) Figures recently published 
illustrate this point: 
The degree of variation in the enforcement of com- 
pulsory education laws is as marked among the States, 
as in every other phase of education. In a statement 
issued by the Census Bureau,!° compiled from the returns 
of the Fourteenth Decennial Census, taken as of January 
1, 1920, we find that the total population seven to thir- 
teen years of age, 15,306,793, included 13,869,010 chil- 
dren attending school. The largest proportion of school 
attendance for this group, 96.1 per cent., is that for 
Massachusetts and the smallest, 75.9 per cent., for 
Louisiana. In seven States—Massachusetts, Rhode 
Island, Ohio, Iowa, Delaware, Idaho, and Utah—the pro- 
portion was 95 per cent. or more. 
It has been seen that in actual practice as it has been 
evolved in American schools, it is the function of the 
school not merely to teach the child who comes to it for 
that purpose, but to bring the child into the school as 
* Summarized in School and Society, Vol. XIV, p. 428.
-P-A-G-E-166
150 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
  well. Ordinarily there is no other way provided for en- 
forcing the law. Civery individual teacher ought to bear 
in mind always that the effort to secure educational op- 
portunities for every child is part of his professional obli- 
gation; a part as important as actual instruction) 
The American school is no longer a mere means of 
giving instruction. To an ever greater degree it has be- 
come the trustee to whom is confided the welfare of 
American childhood. Every teacher must assist in, and 
agitate for, the literal and universal enforcement of exist- 
ing compulsory education laws, as well as the extension 
of such laws in sections of the country where the present 
legislation is quite obviously not in accord with the mod- 
ern social conscience. 
Large units, such as cities, ordinarily concentrate the 
work to be carried on in conforming to this responsibility, 
in attendance departments. These departments are 
charged with the work of dealing with the problem of non- 
attendance. They normally see to the maintenance of the 
continuous census, studying the discrepancy between it 
and the actual attendance; they administer the provisions 
for exemption from the operation of the law, issuing work 
permits in proper cases; they supervise any disciplinary 
classes or parental schools that may be maintained for 
incorrigibles and truants; finally, they carry on the daily 
routine of enforcing the compulsory school laws. By 
means of established routine, they are notified of pro- 
tracted absence and make investigation to determine the 
cause. Wherever possible they effect remedies and return 
the child to school. But not all failure to attend school 
is truancy; not all causes of absence are remediable by 
invoking the State’s law-enforcing machinery. The at-
-P-A-G-E-167
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 151 
tendance department therefore is not merely a depart- 
ment of force; it is as frequently a department of social 
service. By codperating with relief agencies it aids as 
often as it threatens and punishes. But it is an executive 
department. In the nature of things, it rarely studies 
fundamental causes. 
Rural districts, on the other hand, ordinarily have no 
such instrumentality for enforcing the compulsory educa- 
tion laws. The situation simply resolves itself to this: 
The State passes a law but does not accompany it with 
appropriate enforcement machinery of a State-wide char- 
acter. Legislation of this sort in other fields, as for 
example the prohibition of the manufacture and sale of 
alcoholics, would probably not prove highly effective in 
achieving the desired end. The ordinary law-enforcing 
authorities either in the city or in the country pay little 
attention to the compulsory education legislation except 
in specific instances when their attention is forcefully 
called to individual cases. In the cities, the school author- 
ities themselves simply direct some of their energies to 
law enforcement. They go out after the children whom 
they are expected to teach. In the rural districts, organ- 
ized in the form of independent local units of microscopic 
dimensions, no such organized effort to enforce the law 
exists. Poor as the showing for Louisiana is, it unques- 
tionably would be much worse if the figures for the State 
with New Orleans excluded were available. 
Here is another example of discrepancy of educational 
opportunity within the State, operating against the non- 
city child. The demand is for State-wide machinery to 
enforce the compulsory education ideals of the common- 
wealth not only against the parent and guardian, but as
-P-A-G-E-168
  152 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
well against the local community which is not living up 
to the letter and the spirit of the law. 
III. Truancy and Incorrigibility 
The causes of nonattendance.—What are the causes 
which operate to bring about the conditions of nonat- 
tendance described above wherein the discrepancy be- 
tween the population census and school attendance in 
twenty States is shown to be as large as one-fifth, and in 
one State to reach the amazing figure of two-fifths? Why 
are these children of school age not found in school? 
Many explanations have been offered, but almost no 
scientific study has so far been made. The discrepancy 
may perhaps be attributed to four principal causes; 
namely, (1) lax administration of the law; (2) indiffer- 
ence or poverty of the parents; (3) employment furnished 
by those who are interested. in exploiting child labor; 
(4) that deliberate and unnecessary evasion for which 
the child alone is responsible, and which is ordinarily 
referred to as truancy. 
Fundamental to the execution of the compulsory edu- - 
cation law is a system of child accounting based on the 
census of the population of school age. We cannot en- 
force the law until we are in a position to know how many 
children there are to whom this law applies. Any census 
that may be taken begins to be antiquated and out of 
date almost the moment it is completed, and grows con- 
tinually less reliable with the elapsing of every month. 
The remedy for this is a continuous census. Efficient 
school attendance departments are devising methods 
whereby, through the codperation of many agencies, and 
the checking and rechecking of many sources of informa-
-P-A-G-E-169
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 153 
tion, a reasonably complete and reliable census of that 
part of the population which is subject to the operation 
of the compulsory education law is always at hand. 
With the census in hand, the next step, also a con- 
tinuous one, is to account for these children. The meas- 
ure of the efficiency of the enforcing agency, where meth- 
ods for maintaining a census are employed, is very 
simple. The smaller the discrepancy between the census 
and school attendance—in other words, the smaller the 
vercentage of the unaccounted-for group—the more 
efficient the administering agency. We have not yet 
worked out forms for judging the efficiency of attendance 
departments. We do not yet know what percentage of 
the entire population the unaccounted-for group ought 
to be. In practice, as we have seen, it ranges in the case 
of children under thirteen years of age from less than five 
per cent. in Massachusetts to more than twenty-four per 
cent. in Louisiana." 
Accounting for the child population.—In accounting 
for children shown by the continuous census to be subject 
to the school law, we find (1) a group that is attending 
public school; (2) a group that is attending private 
school; (3) a group that is debarred from attending either 
public or private school by reason of physical or mental 
incapacity; and (4) a group that appears to be evading 
the law. It is evident that this process of accounting 
cannot be carried on without the codperation of the pri- 
vate schools. Such codperation requiring parochial and 
other private schools to deal with the public authorities 
in the matter of attendance has been made compulsory 
“See summary of last decennial census figures in School and Society, 
Vol. XIV, p. 428.
-P-A-G-E-170
  154 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
in some States and ought to be made compulsory in all. 
Every phase of the service of the attendance department 
ought to be at the disposal of private schools. 
The unaccounted-for groups.—In dealing with the un- 
accounted-for, or evading, group, children may be divided 
roughly into three classes: We find, first, the group whose 
evasion is deliberately fostered by adults, whether they be 
parents or employers or other adults bent on inducing 
anti-social acts. In such cases it is the business of the 
enforcing agency to invoke the operation of the legal ma- 
chinery provided by law for the enforcement of school 
attendance, whether such machinery be juvenile or other 
courts, or whether the official charged with the prosecution 
be the district attorney or the probation officer. In deal- 
ing with this group it is the fundamental duty of the 
school to invoke the aid of the courts and of the law- 
enforcing authorities to compel adults to refrain from 
keeping children out of school. 
A section of this law-evading group will be found to 
be kept out of school by the operation of sheer poverty— 
lack of clothing, lack of food, inability of parents be- 
cause of negligence or stupidity, or employment of the 
mother during the day. Such children must be rescued 
from these conditions, whatever they be, and must have 
their education safeguarded. In dealing with this group, 
the law-enforcing authorities ordinarily codperate with 
the social-relief agencies of the community. Aid may be 
provided; the children may be recovered from the care 
of incompetent parents, and every case should be followed 
until the child is returned to school. 
Truancy-—The third group, finally, consists of the 
truant. The causes of truancy and the characteristics of
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 155 
the truant are, scientifically speaking, little known. While 
we have a comparatively extensive literature on the sub- 
ject of nonattendance,’? we have almost no reliable 
scientific information. Many reasons for truancy have 
been hazarded, but a perusal of the literature will indi- 
cate that in this field we are just emerging from the 
status of sentimentalizing, and the general assumption 
that all children would be good if they were made happy. 
Some interesting information may be gained from the 
study of one hundred truants recently carried on in 
Philadelphia, and reported in a Bulletin of the Bureau of 
Education.1* 
This study would seem to indicate: first, that truancy 
in cities at any rate is almost exclusively a boy problem, 
that it may begin as early as age eight, that it becomes 
prominent at age ten; that from this point it advances 
steadily to age twelve, and is likely to be most acute be- 
tween ages twelve and fourteen. More than one-half of 
the children reported in this study were truant between 
these ages. 
These figures are interestingly confirmed in a study 
made by Dr. J. Harold Williams of twenty-one boys com- 
mitted to: the Whittier State School in California, whose 
primary offense was chronic truancy.1* In this group two 
boys began their truant habits as early as age nine; eleven 
boys—more than one-half—became offenders between the 
ages of twelve and fourteen; and the median age, thirteen,

-P-A-G-E-172
  156 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
corresponds with the age of the largest number of truants 
found in the study reported above. 
Some interesting information was gathered in the Phil- 
adelphia study regarding grade location. The group was 
decidedly a retarded one and the greater the over-age, 
the more troublesome the person. Fifty-one per cent. 
of this group of children were more than three years be- 
hind the grade normal for their age, and twenty-one per 
cent. were retarded five years or more; only six per cent. 
were at grade. It would seem that this showing could 
have only one possible significance; namely, that low 
intelligence is a most important factor in inducing tru- 
ancy. It is now almost universally conceded that the 
most fundamental cause of retardation, particularly ag- 
gravated retardation, is low intelligence. 
In view of this finding, it would seem inescapable that 
the first and most important step to be taken in the study 
of truancy is the giving of psychological tests to all 
truants. In cases where feeble-mindedness or dullness 
far below average is found, no further cause need be 
sought, the child being evidently out of place in the 
school as ordinarily organized, and incapable of adjust- 
ing himself to the ordinary school situation. The parental 
schools should avail themselves of the information so 
readily obtainable in regard to the intelligence status of 
the children committed to their care. This information 
is probably the most important fundamental index to 
the cause of truancy and the character of treatment 
required. 
In a recent study covering a large number of subjects 
and a rather extensive territory, the writer states it as 
one of his conclusions that “environmental influences
-P-A-G-E-173
  
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 157 
more often caused a child to stop attending school than 
did lack of ability to do the work.” “It has been sug- 
gested,” he says, “by some who give large stress to the fac- 
tor of heredity that the environmental factors measured 
here are merely an objective expression—a resultant— 
of the heredity of these homes.1° However, he does not 
believe that his facts lead to any such conclusion. This 
inference would nevertheless seem to be in line with the 
Philadelphia study referred to above and is even more 
interestingly confirmed in the report of another study 1° 
conducted in New York City, and including one hundred 
and fifty cases. 
In this instance an intelligence test was given to every 
child, and it was found that forty-three per cent. were 
“actually feeble-minded” and eight per cent. were border- 
line cases, showing a total of approximately one-half of 
all the truants studied below average intelligence. 
In Dr. Williams’ study of twenty-one truants referred 
to above, ten cases were found to belong to feeble-minded 
and border-line status, and to be defined as below normal. 
In view of the scanty data in these studies no conclusions 
can yet be drawn; yet it is an interesting coincidence 
that the proportion of one-half is maintained in both. 
Dr. Williams found a single child of better than average 
intelligence. The median intelligence of his group of 
truants was I.Q.84. Oddly enough, none of these mental 
defectives, with one exception, were found in ungraded 
classes which are provided for the education of the feeble- 
minded.

-P-A-G-E-174
    158 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
It is unfortunate that the New York study does not 
indicate the intelligence status of the forty-nine per cent. 
found to be of an intelligence above the border line. It 
would be interesting to know what the frequency of 
truancy would be in children of better than average in- 
telligence. One feels inclined to believe that the per- 
centage would be almost insignificant. After all, truancy 
is a rather vague, undirected, and unplanned sort of 
thing. The superior child who became dissatisfied with 
school would probably be likely to engage definitely in 
some other occupation or enter some school that pleased 
him more. 
It would seem hard to doubt the probability that poor 
intelligence is a major cause of truancy, very likely 
accounting for fifty per cent. of the occurrences. In report- 
ing “an investigation of children under Council Supervi- 
sion” conducted by the Society for Experimental Peda- 
gogy in Denmark,!7 Professor Tybjerg gives the following 
facts regarding those-children, who “are criminally or 
morally corrupt.” As regards the seven hundred children 
studied, “it was found that the critical age . . . is thir- 
teen to fourteen years for the boys, and fifteen to seven- 
teen for the girls.” More than fifty per cent. of the group 
received the lowest intelligence rating, “poor,” and less 
than two per cent. received the best rating, “excellent.” 
While the word truant is not synonymous with “crimi- 
nal or morally corrupt,” a classification which included 
offenders of various kinds, and while the intelligence 
status of the group is not indicated in quantitative terms, 
the evidence is, nevertheless, significant in view of its 
confirmation of the critical age and the probable intelli-

-P-A-G-E-175
    
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 159 
gence of truants, as indicated in the three foregoing 
studies already referred to. 
Finally, it may be permitted to quote a student well 
entitled to a respectful hearing: “The problem of truancy 
is also one in which feeble-mindedness is involved. Many 
a school child becomes a truant because he cannot succeed 
in school. We need careful tests of the mentality of 
truants. One such study shows upwards of eighty per 
cent. of them feeble-minded.” 18 This group does not 
need any of the treatment that has been advocated in 
the literature, nor is the school to blame for their de- 
linquency. They require the special treatment, prefer- 
ably institutional, that is scientifically indicated for 
feeble-mindedness. 
It is somewhat aside from the direct issue, but interest- 
ing to note the revelations and, it is to be hoped, the 
revolutions, resulting from our present reliable method 
of detecting feeble-mindedness. Binet began the process 
by finding the feeble-minded in insane asylums, where 
they certainly did not belong. More recently they have 
been discovered in penal institutions, such as reform 
schools, in orphan asylums, and in homes for adult de- 
pendents. The studies above referred to probably indi- 
cate that we may now look for this same group in the 
parental schools maintained by cities for the treatment 
and cure of truancy. 
Obviously so far as this group is concerned, severity 
of discipline and change of home environment are not 
likely to effect the desired change. It would seem clear 
that an intelligence survey of every parental school in 
the country ought to be made, the feeble-minded located

and given appropriate treatment. This done, there stil] 
remains an important group whose intelligence is average 
or better. The causes for the delinquency of this group 
of incorrigibles are little known. Undoubtedly poor home 
conditions are important in failing to restrain, as good 
home conditions do deter, certain of the tendencies that 
manifest themselves during early adolescence. More 
accurate data are needed in this field. 
Summary 
The right of the State to compel parents to send their — 
children to publicly supported schools, or give them 
equivalent opportunities, may now be assumed. But, 
while there is no concerted opposition to this legislation 
on the part of parents, certain industries which employ 
child labor make determined opposition to the extension 
of the compulsory school period. 
The age to which children are required to attend schoo} 
varies in the American States from twelve to eighteen, 
thirty-five States naming age sixteen as the ultimate age 
to which full-time attendance is compulsory. 
But the length of time required is an insufficient index 
to the efficacy of any given statute. The character and 
number of the exemptions from the operation of the law 
that are provided, and the minimum number of days or 
weeks of attendance each year that are required, con- 
stitute important modifying factors. 
Five important problems awaiting solution in this field 
may be summarized as follows: (1) the length of the 
compulsory period; (2) the character of the exemptions 
to be allowed; (3) the minimum period of attendance to 
be required each year; (4) the desirability of local option 
for counties or smaller divisions; (5) the enforcing of
-P-A-G-E-177
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 161 
the law as against (a) children and parents, and (b) 
recalcitrant local communities. 
As regards the first three of these problems, the state- 
ment is made that scientific basis for the final solution 
of these questions is lacking, and that the legislatures are 
not proper bodies to work out these solutions. The sug- 
gestion is made that legislation, which is slow, cumber- 
some, and tends to uniformity of practice where diversity 
is needed, be replaced by Boards or Commissions pos- 
sessed of broad discretionary powers and charged with 
legislating in the field of education as well as with the 
duty of administering such legislation. 
Local option in the matter of compulsory education 
seems to be a vicious practice tending to aggravate 
already existing disparities of educational opportunity 
within the several States. 
Finally, in the matter of enforcement, the suggestion 
is made that enforcement of compulsory education legis- © 
lation against local communities must, and against indi- 
viduals should, be a function of the State. Until this 
becomes the practice, the rural districts add to their other 
disadvantages that of failing to enforce the law as well as 
the cities, where special departments for the purpose of 
compelling compliance with the law are ordinarily found. 
There is always discrepancy between census and at- 
tendance, and the reduction of the percentage of non- 
attendance to the minimum is the business of the school. 
When the group receiving instruction in privately main- 
tained schools is accounted for, it will be found that non- 
attendance is due to (1) lax enforcement, (2) indifference 
or poverty of parents, (3) exploitation of children by 
other adults, and (4) truancy. 
The first three causes may be increasingly eliminated 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
    162 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
by constant vigilance. The fourth cause, truancy, pre- 
sents an educational problem. 
The opinion is hazarded in this chapter, on the basis 
of four studies referred to, that in fifty per cent. of all 
the cases, truancy is due to feeble-mindedness, and this 
group should be given treatment appropriate to that in- 
telligence status. As to the other fifty per cent. the causes 
may be guessed with some degree of certainty; but with 
scientific accuracy they are not known. 
Problems 
This chapter deals with a number of challenging prob- 
lems, none of which have been finally solved, all of which 
require the application of scientific procedure to the field 
of education. 
1. At what age should children be required to attend 
school and for how many years should they be required to 
continue to do so? 
2. Should the requirements be uniform? If not, on 
what basis should the discrimination be made? 
8. Should the requirement be in terms of years or in 
terms of accomplishment? } 
4, Should economic considerations be permitted, as 
they now do in many States, to secure exemption from 
the operation of the law? If so, should there be an irre- 
ducible minimum representing a relationship of age and 
attainment, and what should this index or quotient be? 
5. On the basis of educational experience and theory, 
what is the minimum number of consecutive days or 
weeks—term—necessary for effective work? 
6. Make a comparative study of the compulsory law 
enforcement facilities of a typical rural county and a 
small city of equivalent population in the same State.  
-P-A-G-E-179
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 163 
7. Outline the organization and the work of an At- 
tendance Department for a city. 
8. Discuss the desirability of having the State take 
over all the duty of enforcing the compulsory education 
law. If you come to a conclusion favoring that arrange- 
ment, outline a form of organization, and detail the work 
to be done, including (a) a division to deal with local 
units of control, and (6), for purposes of routine, local 
branch offices—possibly associated with the county 
superintendents. 
9. Make a local study of the causes of nonattendance, 
tending to establish a standard classification that may 
have general validity, within which to distribute the 
irreducible percentage of the child population who are 
not found in school. 
10. Within the classification “truancy”—nonattend- 
ance orginating with the child, and not materially induced 
by adults or uncontrollable situations—test the predic- 
tion made in the chapter that fifty per cent. of this group 
are below normal in intelligence. 
11. Within the group of truants found by test to be 
of normal intelligence try to establish a standard classifi- 
cation that may have general validity, containing typical 
causes of truancy.

CHAPTER VIII 
(HE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 
I. General Principles 
Which is the normal child?—The concept of normality 
is probably very little distinguishable from that of typical 
or average. One needs only to think of Jonathan Swift’s 
“Gulliver’s Travels” to realize that normality is a com- 
parative, not an absolute idea, and signifies conformity to 
the vast mass or average, which, after all, represents the 
characteristics that are “typical” and deviation from 
which makes the deviate non-typical. The very same 
person may be abnormally small, or abnormally large, 
abnormally wise or abnormally foolish, depending on 
whether the comparison is made with a Brobdingnagian 
or a Lilliputian. In this same way feeble-mindedness is a 
relative term, the fact of its existence depending not alto- 
gether on the mental make-up of the individual, but in 
part on the mental make-up of the group as a whole, who 
constitute the type. When, as part of the preparation 
for war, psychological tests were applied to large numbers 
of men and it was learned that the presumed average of 
intelligence had been overestimated, the definition of 
feeble-mindedness was automatically altered and certain 
quantitative indices which had hitherto indicated feeble- 
mindedness, now placed the individual in a higher class, 
ie. dull but normal.

The problem of the non-typical.—All of which is to 
serve as an introduction to the educational problems in- 
volved in the fact that when a very large number of chil- 
dren are brought together for instruction, there are al- 
ways found some who deviate from type in one or more 
ways, and therefore represent special problems. The 
ordinary way, historically, has been to do away with, 
disregard, ridicule, or at best be merciful to deviates. To 
the normal or average individual there is something 
almost uncanny about marked deviation from type, and 
he feels a revulsion towards it. Perhaps the furthest that 
our form of civilization approached toward humane treat- 
ment of deviates before a real attack on the problem which 
is so recent in origin as to be almost contemporary, was 
to treat such unfortunate persons with a considerable 
degree of Christian mercy and kindness. The sane, im- 
personal attitude, which might lead to a compensation 
of the handicap by education was difficult to cultivate 
among people who conceived of superstitious explanations 
for the occurrence of the facts. In an age when an in- 
significant proportion of the entirely typical part of the 
population was subjected to formal education, it seemed 
unnecessary to undertake to salvage by education the 
members of the community marked by some acute de- 
viation, persons from whom at best might be expected 
less than the typical were capable of contributing. 
With the arrival of the concept of democracy, and the 
ideals of compulsory universal education, these questions 
assume new aspects. The law requires that all children 
present themselves for education. The fact of the exist- 
ence of large masses of children makes the practice of 
individual instruction, which might automatically take 
care of many deviates, an impractical process. The  
-P-A-G-E-183
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 167 
method of simultaneous instruction is devised. Simul- 
taneous instruction is based on the assumption of some, 
even though crude, homogeneity. This homegeneity is 
found in the most obvious characteristic—approximate 
similarity in age. The children are grouped in this 
manner, and minor variations of every kind, such as 
slight deafness, blindness, dullness, are taken care of in a 
variety of modifications of the procedure, in frequent re- 
classification of the groups, and in the common agreement 
that perfect evenness of progress, and equality of ultimate 
attainment are not to be expected. 
But some children are totally deaf, or totally blind, or 
greatly lacking in intelligence. No amount of resiliency 
in the prescribed procedure can take care of these chil- 
dren. They cannot be subjected to the process of in- 
struction at all, as it is organized for the typical group. 
And yet they cannot be disregarded. Democracy means 
equality of opportunity. We should not be acting in 
accord with our ethical and social ideals if we failed to 
educate those children who are not susceptible of treat- 
ment in the standard manner devised for the group. 
Moreover, purely selfish motives operate to make so- 
ciety interested in the education of these children. Com- 
plete lack of education means, almost always, lack of 
ability in the matter of self-support. In our society, per- 
sons completely incapable of self-support are supported 
at the cost of the rest of the group. In so far as the type 
of education particularly adapted to the kind of deviation 
makes the recipient of this education.self-supporting, in 
whole or in part, in so far is the community relieved from 
that burden. Ultimately, it is probably cheaper to fur- 
nish education than to maintain asylums. 
In sections of the United States which are extensively 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
    168 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
engaged in fruit raising and fruit shipping, methods are 
in vogue for the classification of the products of the 
orchards into groups that are normal, and for the discard 
of the comparatively small quantities that do not fit 
into any commercial definition of type. Oranges, for ex- 
ample, are rushed over screens containing the several 
holes which approximate the sizes of commercially usable 
fruit. As the fruit is forced over this screen, most of the 
oranges fall into these holes, each into its appropriate 
group. But some do not fit. They are too small, or oc- 
casionally too large. These are culls. In a democracy 
such as ours, which supports education liberally, and de- 
mands by law that all children be sent to school for a 
prescribed minimum number of years, the masses are 
subjected to a rather crude screen and classification, into 
which most of them fit. The poor of hearing, the par- 
tially blind, the dull, the physically under par, and others 
whose deviation is not very aggravated, find it possible to 
get through. The school admits them, and as the pro- 
cess of education becomes more and more effective, more 
and more supplementary provision is made for those 
who may find the pace severe. Instruction in the open 
air, the mid-morning glass of milk, school books with 
especially large type, and other features serve to make 
the road easier and the pace within their limitations. 
But some of the children are culls. No sort of supple- 
mentary treatment will avail to keep them with the group. 
And the culls cannot be thrown away. They are human 
beings. It is the business of the schools to find ways and 
means to develop them to, their utmost capacity. Sys- 
tems do not exist primarily for themselves, but for the 
children. Where the children cannot fit into the estab-
-P-A-G-E-185
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 169 
lished system, the system must be changed and adapted 
to fit the child. 
A theory for the education of non-typical children — 
And so we come to the particular problem of this chap- 
ter, namely, the development of a theory for the educa- 
tion within the public schools of those children who in 
one or more ways deviate from the normal which, as we 
have seen, really means the average. In order to main- 
tain oneself in modern society, it is only necessary to con- 
form to the average in those characteristics, physical and 
mental, which characterize the vast mass of the popula- 
tion. Possession, in excess of the average, of powers 
which are useful in the race of life always represents ad- 
ditional capital with which the individual can, by proper 
use, secure for himself advantages superior to those en- 
joyed by the average individual. Possession of powers of 
this kind in quantity less than that possessed by the aver- 
age of the population, means a handicap which, if not 
compensated for by unusual gifts of another type, or by 
education, or by the choice of an occupation in which 
the missing abilities play the least possible réle, will de- 
prive the person of the degree of self-support attainable 
for the average of the group. 
We have said that persons who differ from the group 
in some way should be given opportunity for education 
to the utmost of their powers. It is probably more ac- 
curate to say that the guiding motive in the education 
of these classes should be the reduction of the handicap 
to the lowest possible minimum. Any person who de- 
viates from the group, even if the deviation be so small 
a matter as left-handedness, learns in due course that his 
deviation represents a handicap. The left-handed person 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
    170 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
soon learns that daily life is organized with a view to 
right-handedness. Life is, in fact, organized in terms of 
the completely typical. Since we cannot reorganize our 
mode of social intercourse to suit the particular physical 
or mental constitution of the varying physical and mental 
deviations, the fundamental principle applicable to every 
type of deviation must be the effort to minimize the 
handicap. 
How true this principle is may be strikingly illustrated 
in the case of the very highly endowed, whose deviation 
consists of possessing, quantitatively, a great deal more 
than average intelligence. The possession of this degree 
of intelligence represents, since these persons cannot 
build for themselves a world of geniuses and must live in 
the one that exists, the danger of becoming socially ab- 
normal. No teacher interested in the welfare of these 
children regards this danger with indifference. Deviation 
is, to an amazing extent, synonymous with oddity and 
peculiarity. The group represents the standard. For the 
sake of normal social development, students of the ques- 
tion of the education of gifted children would, under 
present conditions, actually retard the rate of progress 
and make it slower than is really possible, letting formal 
instruction wait until maturity catches up at least in 
part with the development of intelligence—all in an en- 
deavor to preserve that very precious characteristic, so- 
cial normality. The social psychologists pointed out long 
ago that deviation from the group means pain and suf- 
fering. The minimizing of deviation, therefore, to the 
lowest possible degree while preserving to the greatest 
possible extent the development of all the potentialities 
for rich, fruitful, happy, and profitable living—this is the 
problem of the education of the unusual child.
-P-A-G-E-187
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 171 
Which is the non-typical child?—When shall we regard 
a child as educationally exceptional? “Borrowing the 
phraseology of the law (of Connecticut), an exceptional 
school child is one whose mental or physical personality 
deviates so markedly from the average standard as to 
cause a special status to arise with respect to his educa- 
tional treatment and outlook.” ! This is a rough but en- 
tirely adequate description of the child whose education 
forms the problem of this chapter. 
Many attempts have been made at the definition of 
the unusual child, but the safest procedure is to bear 
in mind the fact that there is no object in making defini- 
tions for their own sake, and that classifications are made 
for definite purposes, and may therefore vary as these 
purposes vary. For the shoe clerk, to take a homely ex- 
ample, most of the pupils of a school for the totally deaf 
are quite likely to be normal, and some of the children in 
the typical school, the reverse. He would have to re- 
classify the population from his point of view. Psychol- 
ogists, sociologists, physicians, and all other students in- 
terested in the development of childhood, may make their 
own classifications. 
The teacher needs neither intricate theory nor fine 
discrimination in this matter. He is not interested in 
classification as an end in itself. From his point of view, 
all children are typical who can be reasonably well taught 
with the group, even in cases where supplementary pro- 
visions are occasionally necessary to help them to keep 
up, or where frequent reclassification is necessary in order 
to relocate them in more appropriate groups. The child 
of defective vision or hearing who must be seated close to

  the blackboard or to the teacher, the crippled child who 
must be assisted to get to school, but is susceptible of 
ordinary treatment when he gets there and who faces 
the average future, the undernourished child who needs 
milk, the immigrant child who suffers temporarily from 
a language handicap—these are, from the pragmatic 
point of view of the school, typical children. They re- 
quire special attention, not because of their peculiarities, 
but because of our system of simultaneous instruction. 
The special provisions do not exist because they need a 
totally different kind of education, but because they need 
assistance in holding their own with the group. 
Those children are exceptional or unusual, who can- 
not by any method of supplementary assistance be edu- 
cated along with the typical group. The totally blind 
child can under no circumstances use the book which 
forms the medium of instruction, and the totally deaf 
child is at an equally great disadvantage. These children 
must be educated in a manner entirely different, and 
adapted to their varying handicaps. 
The classification of non-typical children.—But it does 
not follow from the foregoing that these children cannot 
be taught in groups. On the contrary, they must be so 
taught in the first place for practical reasons of economy, 
and in the second place for those educational reasons 
which find special values in group instruction. We come 
then to the problem of classification of unusual children. 
In this connection, only those distinctions are of value 
which serve the purpose of grouping children into simul- 
taneously educable classifications. 
There being no established, universally agreed upon 
practice, the following grouping is proposed in the belief
-P-A-G-E-189
  
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 173 
that it will be found practical: Children who are unusual 
by the definition outlined above, are uneducable with 
the group for reasons that are primarily mental, tem- 
peramental, or physical. In a being whose organization 
is so complex as that of the human infant, causes are 
perhaps rarely single, and so it is well to emphasize the 
fact that the distinguishing characteristic is referred to as 
the primary and the most obvious and most marked 
variation. Under each of these three divisions there are 
subtypes to be noted, and a complete classification for 
our purposes may be tabulated as follows: 
I. Unusual children for reasons primarily mental. 
1. The most highly endowed group. 
2. The most poorly endowed group. 
II. Unusual children for reasons primarily tempera- 
mental. 
1. Incorrigibles and truants (except the feeble- 
minded). 
2. Speech defectives. 
III. Unusual children for reasons primarily physical. 
1. The deaf. 
2. The blind. 
8. The crippled. 
This classification cannot stand without some explana- 
tion, particularly of certain omissions. Referring first 
to the classification for reasons primarily mental, the 
reader is asked to observe that variation may occur in 
two ways which, for convenience, may be referred to as 
vertical and horizontal variations. Let us consider the 
variations indicated in our classification as horizontal. 
In this sense, a purely quantitative one, implying a
-P-A-G-E-190
  174 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
greater or less amount of intelligence, we have deliberately 
omitted the feeble-minded. Since the members of this 
class, by the agreement of all students of the subject, 
should be colonized because they can never be made self- 
supporting and self-sustaining members of the com- 
munity (at any rate outside of institutions), they are 
not properly a problem of the American public schools. 
They exist, but our classification is made for practical 
purposes of grouping the educable children who properly 
belong in the public schools. Feeble-minded children are 
unfortunately found in the day schools of all the cities. 
But they do not belong there. No person belongs in the 
public schools who by virtue of his handicap probably 
will not be able to participate, without supervision, in 
our modern society. The city schools are educating the 
future self-supporting citizens of the commonwealths. 
Again, it will be noted that no fine distinctions are 
made under this heading. This conforms to the facts. 
From the point of view of the school, the average group is 
much larger than it is from the point of view of the psy- 
chologist. As has been stated, the average group includes 
all who can somehow travel the regular path, even those 
who may require more time or special assistance, and some 
for whom the work is too meager and too slow. Those 
only are unusual who require actual differentiation of the 
educational process. Of such there are two types, the very 
dullest of the non-feeble-minded and hence potentially 
self-supporting group, and the most highly endowed 
group. The classification is made although, as we shall see 
in a later chapter, the highly endowed group is at present 
to all intents and purposes unprovided for in the matter 
of completely differentiated education.
-P-A-G-E-191
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 175 
  Finally, coming to what we have termed vertical varia- 
tion, neurotic, neurasthenic, and psychopathic deviation 
from normal may occur at any point along the vertical 
line. It is as possible for the feeble-minded as it is for 
the highly endowed, to be insane. We make no provision 
in our classification for this type of deviation for the 
sufficient reason that this deviation does not present an 
educational problem. The classification is not made for 
its own sake, but in order to group children for purposes 
of instruction. The insane have no place in the public 
school. Therefore, they find no place in our classification. 
In the group naming temperamental variation as the 
main cause, we find two classes, the incorrigible and the 
speech defectives. We have claimed in the preceding 
chapter that a large percentage of truancy and incorrigi- 
bility is due to feeble-mindedness or very low intelligence. 
The proper diagnosis of this group would bring them into 
our first classification, mental. Of the remaining num- 
ber, these truants who are kept from school for social 
causes such as poverty, or the delinquency of adults, would, 
these causes removed, be located in the typical group. 
Finally, the real truants and incorrigibles probably vary 
for several reasons which may, for the present at least, 
be grouped under the term temperamental. The reasons 
for placing speech defectives in this classification will be- 
come clear when, later in this chapter, we study the causes 
underlying the defects. 
The inclusions in the group of physical defectives are 
probably obvious. On the other hand, the failure to in- 
clude some classes may need a word of explanation. 
Children who are anemic, tubercular, undernourished, 
and generally below par, present a school, but not an 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  176 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
educational problem. They need attention, but not spe- 
cial education. The care of these children has been given 
some attention in the chapter on the physical welfare 
of the pupil community. Effective remedies in these 
cases restore the children to the typical group. Even 
where no permanent remedy is effected, the educational 
treatment is not varied. Children in Eskimo garb on a 
school roof receive the same type of instruction as their 
more healthy fellows. 
It remains, finally, to explain the omission from any 
section of our classification of certain groups usually in- 
cluded. Epilepties, like the feeble-minded, do not belong 
in the public day schools. Certain other types, as the 
immigrant, the children retarded because of illness or 
transfer, represent a temporary disadvantage. They are 
typical children who, given a little extra care to enable 
them to overcome their deficiencies, are soon restored 
to the large group. They are not inherently different. 
They do not represent a permanently special educational 
problem,—and that is the only ultimately worth-while 
test. 
The several special problems—We come now to a 
brief discussion of the problems of differentiated educa- 
tion presented by the various groups of unusual children. 
A discussion of the types classified under causes pri- 
marily mental is reserved for succeeding chapters on 
classification for purposes of instruction, and on the 
curriculum. Under the classification “temperamental,” 
the incorrigible group were discussed in the preceding 
chapter. This leaves for discussion here, four types, 
ie. speech defectives, the deaf, the blind, and the 
crippled.

II. The Education of Speech Defectives 
Causes as related to remedial procedure.—‘Speech, 
per se, as a faculty, is not innate in man; every human 
being is born speechless. The child gradually learns to 
speak, and unconsciously speech is developed with other 
bodily and mental faculties. While means of speech is 
possessed at birth, in its development it is subject to dis- 
turbances by disease or other causes. Speech is produced 
by the prompt codperation of three great mechanical fac- 
tors, namely, respiration, vocalization, and articulation, 
with which is associated mentation, or the action of the 
mind. Modern medicine and psychology have put to 
their credit a notable achievement by the demonstration 
that defective speech is at bottom a mental rather than a 
physical disease, where a definite defect of the speech 
organs does not exist. Children suffering from such a 
speech defect as stuttering are highly strung or sensitively 
organized. They are emotional, temperamental, and 
easily influenced.” 2 
“Modern medicine has put to its credit a notable 
achievement by its demonstration that defective speech 
is at bottom a pathological condition. . . . At the univer- 
sity clinic at Berlin it was definitely demonstrated by Pro- 
fessor Herman Gutzmann that defective-speech children 
are sick children. Lispers usually had some pathological 
condition of the peripheral end organs of speech. Stut- 
terers usually had a central involvement which required 
extensive medical examination to diagnose and classify. 
A speech specialist of America bears out the pathological 
?D. J. McDonald, Speech Improvement. (Proceedings of the Na- 
tional Education Association for 1916, p. 862.)
-P-A-G-E-194
  
  t | t 
178 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
contention by citing that 97 per cent. of 1000 cases of 
stuttering that came under his observation had some 
pathological condition that required medical treatment; 
and in about 38 per cent. of the cases, surgical treatment 
of some form or other had to be resorted to... . The 
case seen was that of a child about nine years old who 
for two years never spoke above a whisper. On examina- 
tion by means of the laryngoscope the true state of the 
vocal cords was revealed. An application of the internal 
faradic brush was sufficient to remove the anesthesia of 
the larynx.” * 
And so the doctors differ, illustrating what to us is very 
important, namely, that we are pioneering in a new field, 
The pedagogues tend to agree with the idea that the 
causes are temperamental rather than pathological, and 
that, therefore, the treatment should consist of training, 
which belongs to the teacher, and not of surgery or medi- 
cation, which belongs to another profession. “Experience 
has shown that in many cases a cure may be effected wit 
comparative ease if the training is begun at an ‘sea 
stage. . . . It has been demonstrated that great improve: 
ment and even cure can be effected if only one-half hour 
of instruction is given per week.” * 
Stuttering, says Dr. Gesell, “is definitely curable, and 
responds to corrective training. Such training is largel 
a skilled and specialized phonic instruction which a 
be given in public school classes.” > 
But there is in fact as little agreement regarding the

of the National Education Association for 1916, p. 864.)

  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 179 
type of treatment to be given in school as there is regard- 
ing the basic causes of speech defect. There is no stand- 
ard, generally accepted procedure. “During the last 
school year” (1915-1916), reports Dr. Walter B. Swift,® 
“T traveled some two thousand miles and visited over 
twenty-five cities for the purpose of ascertaining what 
methods were used for the improvement of speech in the 
public schools. I fownd the methods as numerous as were 
the cities visited.” 
To resume: A certain proportion of the pupil com- 
munity consists of speech defectives. Deficiency in this 
regard is not only a social drawback, and a potent cause 
of almost inestimable misery; it is also a definite bar to 
many vocations for which the sufferer may have every 
other qualification. ‘Only those familiar with the sub- 
ject can appreciate how serious this handicap is, what 
suffering it causes, and what effects it produces on the 
sensitive child.” 
Nevertheless, for reasons referred to in the beginning 
of this chapter, this defect has been taken for granted 
during past ages, and very little effort has been made 
to battle against it. The first important attack on the 
problem, says Dr. Greene, came in the form of operations 
on the tongue for the cure of defective speech performed 
by surgeons beginning with Dieffenbach in 1841. But 
it was soon found that physical deformities are not ac- 
countable for a large proportion of the cases, and the 
attack shifted to a study of possible psychic causes—a 
point which is still considered by most teachers an im- 
portant part of the problem of reéducation.

These children “are highly strung or sensitively or- 
ganized.” It is for this reason that we have grouped 
them as differing from the typical group mainly by virtue 
of temperament. That proportion of them whose defects 
are remediable by some type of medical or surgical care, 
are not educational problems any more than are the un- 
dernourished or anemic. Those who really need educa- 
tional attention and can be improved by education need it 
because of unhealthy temperamental organization. All of 
the drill commonly tends toward the goal of giving these 
children conscious control of themselves. 
To this phase of the subject we shall return later. 
Meanwhile it is obvious that the first step to take, after 
segregating the group of speech defectives, is to detect 
those who require medical and not educational treat- 
ment. Every child should, therefore, be examined by 
an experienced medical specialist. Cases of “decided 
lockjaw deformities, and latent nervous or psychiatric 
conditions” may well be left to the medical profession, 
says Dr. Swift. “The chief service that the physician 
can render the teacher is in finding organic causes of 
speech defect, or in stating clearly that there are none.” 
It is the group that is not suffering from organic defects 
or definite psychic disturbances, that constitutes the 
proper field of labor for the teacher. As to this group, 
it must be stated that the work is so new, and the con- 
tributions that have so far been made are so lacking in 
authoritativeness, the experiments have been so few and 
the data gathered so unreliable, that, in America at any 
rate, the work still remains to be done. We have barely 
arrived at the point where the physician is receding into 
the background and the teacher is coming into his own.

  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 181 
This teacher is a pioneer. Facilities for his training are 
lacking and will so remain until information and skills 
that may be transmitted, have accumulated. 
Unsettled status of classification of defects and of 
remedial procedure.—The classification of speech defects 
is not standardized. One hears of stammering, stuttering, 
cluttering, mumbling, lisping, and other defects. Unfor- 
tunately, teachers in this field sometimes tend to broaden 
their work and include readily remediable defects of voice, 
enunciation, and pronunciation, work in the nature 
rather of ordinary teaching than of dealing with the prob- 
lems of a handicapped group. Then again, the work is 
sometimes confused with remedial work for the deaf and 
partially deaf, and students of the problem of speech from 
that point of view undertake this work also. This com- 
bination has its dangers. The problems are too dissimilar. 
Again, there is lack of agreement in procedure. Not 
only do teachers and systems differ in the mode of at- 
tack, but within the system and with the same teacher, 
the statement is sometimes made that uniform procedure 
is not possible. “The method used depends entirely upon 
the individual, the subject being studied.” * While this 
is necessarily true to some extent, as much as the fact that 
no teaching can ever be uniform and standardized so long 
as the chief characteristic of the race is variation, it must 
also be true that as types become established, routine 
methods for particular defects, ages, and original causes, 
will tend to come into use. Meanwhile we hear of cor- 
rect breathing, relaxation, rhythm, articulation, pro- 
nunciation, tone production, the development of self-

confidence, poise, and, finally, conscious control of the 
speech organism which others use without any knowledge 
of its operation. 
We do not know how many speech defectives there are 
ordinarily per thousand of the school population. We 
are just beginning to learn that some children formerly 
dismissed as stubborn, or backward, or dull, are speech 
defectives. What is even more important, the work is 
’ not as widespread as one might suppose from a considera- 
tion of its importance. As is the case with all types of 
special work which require a large population from which 
to select the exceptional few if the work is to be done 
with any degree of economy, it is safe to say that prac- 
tically no remedial care is provided for children living in 
the rural districts. Of the sixty-eight cities in the United 
States which number more than 100,000 in population, not 
more than twenty-five ® have made provision for this 
work. In other words, it is probably safe to say that it is 
exceptional and not usual for the speech defective to be 
attending a school where remedial work will be offered. 
As regards the major part of the child population, a begin- 
ning is still to be made. 
Specialized full-time schools proposed.—The cities 
which now provide some special work for speech defec- 
tives follow uniformly a procedure whose validity may 
be questioned; they do not establish special schools or 
special classes where all of the child’s regular school work 
is done. They remove the child from his regular grade 
for one or more periods each week to meet the speech 
teacher with other defectives either in their own building 
or in a center where the speech teacher works, and this 
*Statement based on investigation made by the writer. 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
  
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 183 
instruction is concentrated on speech correction. This 
done, the child is dismissed with instructions for his guid- 
ance, and sometimes a special memorandum is sent to his 
teacher, to enable her to codperate and assist in his efforts 
to overcome his handicap. It would seem that the prin- 
ciples as well of individual as of social psychology operate 
against the efforts of the child under this arrangement. 
While his drawback is with him every moment of his 
school life, the special instruction is given him more or 
less isolated from its application in hourly school use. 
Again, he faces at every attempt to participate in class 
activities that amusement, so painful to endure, which 
is normally meted out to deviates among primitive people 
and children—a state of affairs calculated to induce that 
fear, lack of confidence and of self-respect which may con- 
firm his defects or, at best, retard recovery. 
If children were diagnosed immediately on admission 
to school, when the defect has been established the least 
possible length of time, when self-consciousness and a 
feeling of inferiority have had the least possible oppor- 
tunity to do harm, when there are ahead the maximum 
number of years for correction, and if these children were 
gathered in special schools for full-time regular work, the 
instruction carried on by specially trained teachers would 
be always operative instead of sporadic. The assistance 
would be effective exactly at the moment when the occa- 
sion arises and in connection with regular subject-matter 
rather than in isolation, and would in other ways operate 
for the maximum benefit of the child. Such a school 
would alter its curriculum to suit these children and in- 
troduce the maximum number of exercises calculated to 
be beneficial, as part of the regular work and without the
-P-A-G-E-200
184 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
  child’s knowing at all times that he was concentrating on 
a defect. The teachers in such a school would become 
accustomed to the slower tempo in which oral work must 
necessarily be carried on, and would not feel the strain on 
patience that must be felt when the work of a normal 
class is held up by one stammering child. 
Finally, the laws of social psychology which now oper- 
ate against the defective would stil operate in his 
favor. Not only would he be relieved of the burden of 
ridicule or even sympathy but, others being exactly in 
his case, the salutary effects of rivalry would be brought 
into play. There would be a race for improvement. In- 
stead of exclusive teachers of speech, we need regular 
teachers with this additional training, doing full-time 
work in regular full-time special schools. There are other 
advantages involved. All the medical care, the psycho- 
logical or psychopathic work could be centered for efficient 
operation; systematic observation, experiment and study 
could be carried on, and the school plant adapted in 
whatever ways seemed necessary for the purposes of the 
education of these children. Finally, the arrangement 
would facilitate teacher-training by means of apprentice- 
ship, the best method now available. © 
III. The Deaf and the Blind 
Definition of these classes and numerical aspect of 
the problem.—It is obvious that there are all degrees of 
defective vision and defective hearing, ranging from 
the slightest deviation from normal to complete 
lack of these senses. What is the degree of blind- 
ness or deafness which handicaps the individual to 
the point where he requires diferentite education? By 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 185 
our definition, the division may be roughly made at that 
point where the child cannot, even with supplementary 
assistance specially devised for him, be kept with the 
regular classes. The schools which have done much work 
of this sort with temporarily or permanently backward 
children, are also in the most progressive centers attempt- 
ing to hold the partially deaf and the partially blind. 
Particularly in the field of sight conservation is there 
being done in certain American cities work of the highest 
possible value. This work has been so well described 
by Mr. R. B. Irwin,® one of its most earnest promoters, 
that we shall content ourselves here with a quotation 
from his description, to indicate something of the pro- 
cedure: 
“In buildings designated as conservation-of-vision 
schools, a room is set aside for the use of children with 
defective eyesight. A teacher is placed in charge of the 
room whose function it is to assist these children to keep 
pace with the boys and girls enjoying normal eyesight. 
All written work is done in the special room. Practically 
all oral work is performed in the regular grade room with 
the other children. For example, a fifth-grade child does 
his written arithmetic, map work, reading, written com- 
position, and writing with the special teacher. Oral 
arithmetic, geography, history, grammar, oral spelling, 
etc., are recited in the regular fifth-grade room. This 
keeps the sight-saving class pupil in competition with 
those enjoying normal vision, and guards against the 
tendency to set special standards applicable only to special 
groups.”

Education, No. VII.)

For purposes of this chapter, a blind person is one “in 
whom the sense of sight either is entirely wanting or is 
so slight as to be of no substantial utility, or a person in 
whom there exists little or no visual perception;” 1° and 
a deaf person is one in whom the sense of hearing is either 
wholly absent, or is so slight as to be of no practical 
value.” 4 | 
In the population at large, there is approximately one 
deaf person to every twenty-five hundred, and about one 
person to every two thousand of the population is blind.1? 
In view of the fact that much of this blindness and deaf- 
ness results from accident or disease occurring in later 
life, the percentage in the population of school age is 
still smaller. Only one-tenth of the total number of the 
blind are found among persons under twenty years of 
age; and as the congenitally deaf account for only one- 
third of the total number, it is quite likely that the per- 
centage among children of school age is smaller than for 
the population at large. 
Present educational status.—The problem is therefore 
not of large proportions but, for the persons involved, of 
vital importance. Both of these classes are, in the United 
States to-day, educated to a large extent in residential 
institutions maintained by the various States, Eighty 
per cent. of all the deaf pupils under instruction in the 
United States in October, 1919, were being trained in 
public residential schools; the public day schools ac- 
counted for fifteen per cent. of the total number under 
instruction; and twenty-one private and denominational

schools cared for the remaining five per cent1* By far 
the largest number of blind and partly blind pupils re- 
ceiving education in the United States attend the resi- 
dential schools. In the school year 1918-19 the attend- 
ance at the forty-five residential institutions was 4616 as 
against 989 attending day schools in thirty-six cities.15* 
The reasons for these facts are found in the accident of 
historical development rather than in deliberate educa- 
tional theory; and the desirability of continuing along 
this line will receive some consideration in a later section. 
While the history and technic of the education of the 
blind and the deaf have no place in a general volume 
devoted to the whole field of elementary education, a few 
facts may be briefly noted: Apparently little of conse- 
quence was done toward solving the problem of the edu- 
cation of the deaf before the middle of the eighteenth 
century. 
“The seat of the first permanent school to be estab- 
lished in the United States for the education of the deaf 
was Hartford, Connecticut; and the name of the one 
man with which the beginning work will forever be 
coupled, is that of Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet.” 14 While 
some efforts to solve the difficult problem of enabling the 
blind to share in the cultural inheritance of the race 
date back as far as the sixteenth century, the real work 
in the education of the blind begins with Valentin Haiiy, 
and the “Institution National des Jeunes Aveugles” 
founded in Paris toward the end of tke eighteenth cen- 
tury. The first American school for the blind was estab- 
lished in Massachusetts in 1832.

Our reference to the special methods of instruction 
must necessarily be brief. “From the beginning of or- 
ganized instruction of the deaf in America a system of 
signs has been in use to a wide extent.” 1° In conjunction 
with the manual alphabet, the system has taken its place 
as a recognized means of education and communication. 
Another method, as yet not so well established in the 
United States as the sign and manual alphabet methods, 
is known as the oral method, which undertakes to counter- 
act the handicap of the deaf by substituting lip reading 
and the conscious formation of words by the deaf, using 
their speech organism. For the deaf are ordinarily not 
“dumb.” They are speechless because they do not hear. 
They may, however, as teachers of this method are demon- 
strating, be given the use of their speech mechanism in 
whole or in part by other means. The oral method is 
gaining in popularity, and is the sole method employed in 
most of the city day schools, to which reference will be 
made later. 
The key to the instruction of the blind, certainly so far 
as reading and writing are concerned, must be the effort 
to substitute the sense of touch for that of sight. Obvious 
though this may seem, the effort to establish a method of 
raised letters which might be read and in which the blind 
might write, and which might be universally adopted, 
has been long and arduous—an interesting history which 
would not be in place here. Suffice it to say that the sys- 
tem of print known as Revised Braille has finally been 
adopted for uniform use in all schools, and that writing 
is done by the use of a special device which enables the 
blind to make this print with comparative rapidity.

THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 189 
  Residential institution or city day school?—Education 
of the blind and the deaf in the United States began 
at a time when city systems were in their infancy and 
struggling to develop facilities for the mass of typical 
children. The schools were established by the States. 
Obviously, if they were to have pupils, they must provide 
residence facilities. The primary object in providing 
these facilities was not that residence was an essential fea- 
ture of the education of the blind and deaf; it was a sim- 
ple necessity if the schools were to have pupils. Once 
established, the system took root. Not only did it be- 
come firmly grounded in practice and develop traditions; 
it grew physically in the constant extension of plant. The 
public became accustomed to the appropriation of funds 
for the education of these classes on the part of the State, 
and the cities, seeing these children cared for education- 
ally, were slow to enter the field. 
But the institutional method of educating these classes 
away from the ordinary atmosphere in which they are to 
live, and in the midst of similarly handicapped persons 
with whom they normally will not associate exclusively, 
is being challenged on theoretical grounds. Unfortu- 
nately, it is rather a law of human institutions that a tra- 
dition once established tends to perpetuate itself and, 
the original reasons failing, new ones not heretofore 
thought of are found. Just as the place of the classics in 
the curriculum was justified for their disciplinary value 
when the original definitely practical reasons for their 
inclusion began to be obsolete, so one must expect to 
meet in this field of controversy some arguments prob- 
ably based not altogether on the interests of the 
children to be educated.
-P-A-G-E-206
  190 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
The first day school for the blind was established by 
the city of Chicago in 1900, since which time such schools 
have been established in a number of other large cities, 
among them Cincinnati, Cleveland, Toledo, Milwaukee, 
Racine, Detroit, New York, Newark, Jersey City, Los 
Angeles, New Orleans, and Houston. The first day school 
for the deaf was probably established in Boston in 1869, 
since which time nearly eighty others have been estab- 
lished, forty of them within the present century. 
Briefly, the case for the day sohiais may be sum- 
marized as follows: 
(1) There is no reason for separating these children 
from their families and normal associations and experi- 
ences. They are not typical ‘neat tie cases, and even 
where homes are broken up, the current tendency among 
social workers is to minimize institutional type of care 
by “placing out,” living in cottages, and other methods. 
The need which compelled boarding in the first place no 
longer is operative to the same extent. 
(2) The children are expected, as far as possible, to 
become normal functioning members of society, not resi- 
dents of institutions. By living at these schools, especially 
arranged for them, and in association with others of their 
kind, they are deprived of valuable experience and in 
fact definitely handicapped. 
(3) In the case of deaf children particularly, living 
at home among speaking persons gives scope for a great 
deal of practice and experience in lip reading and in 
speech. 
(4) Children may begin studying in day schools at a 
much earlier age than is possible in institutions—an im- 
portant advantage, particularly for the deaf.
-P-A-G-E-207
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 191 
Against the day school it is stated: 
(1) That there are transportation difficulties in going 
to and from school. 
(2) That the full-time supervision which the institu- 
tion offers is a very important part of the education of 
the children. 
(3) That grading for group instruction is practically 
impossible in the local schools, which are necessarily small. 
(4) That special curriculum opportunities may be 
offered in the institutions, as for example specifically 
adapted vocational work and music which has played an 
important réle in the institutional education of the blind. 
(5) Normal social intercourse, play, and sports are 
more easily arranged for in an institution among persons 
equally handicapped, making possible a happy personal 
development, and the formation of friendships. 
(6) Some children, by virtue of residence where no 
day schools exist, or by virtue of improper or unfortunate 
home environment, are better cared for in institutions. 
“Consolidation” for special education.—Two impor- 
tant problems should be noted before closing the dis- 
cussion of the education of these children. The case for 
the institutional care of children in so far as it concerns 
arguments inherent in the fact that the group is small 
—as, for example, lack of grading, and poorer curric- 
ulum facilities—is, but ought not to be, valid. As has 
been pointed out in preceding pages, special education 
is very expensive, and because the children to be in- 
structed form a very small portion of the population, the 
expense is not feasible except in the largest centers. 
Special work, such as the care of health, is equally im- 
practical. 
   
-P-A-G-E-208
  192 THE AMERICAN See SCHOOL 
For similar lack of ability in rural districts, other phases 
of education such as music, supervision, and grading, con- 
solidation has been urged. The time has come when, for 
purposes of special education, consolidation should be 
urged on the cities. Wherever communities are so located 
that, while politically separate corporate entities, they 
are, in terms of geographic contiguity, transportation, and 
other features, single communities, they should unite in 
maintaining in common, for all the children involved, 
these special schools. Four large cities bordering on San 
Francisco Bay, for example, San Francisco, Oakland, 
Berkeley, and Alameda, or the two large cities, Minne- 
apolis and St. Paul, as well as other communities simi- 
larly located could to the advantage of the children 
involved and, with the organization of transportation 
facilities, maintain in common better schools for handi- 
capped children than exist in any of them singly. 
The problem of attendance.—The period of compul- 
sory education ordinarily provided by law is insufficient 
in duration to give these children the necessary minimum 
of education and many of them are therefore deprived of 
it, in spite of the fact that facilities are at hand. Handi- 
capped children necessarily require more time to do the 
same work as typical children. Standards for these chil- 
dren are necessarily different. A change in the law, mak- 
ing longer periods of attendance necessary for the totally 
blind and deaf, is an immediate need. A better method 
than the passage of such legislation, however, would be 
large discretionary powers in the hands of the permanent 
Board of Education, which, with the advice of experts, 
could make school regulations to meet situations as they 
arise. It ought not to be necessary to go to the legisla-

ture and spend effort educating that body every time a 
situation such as this arises in the education of the chil- 
dren of the commonwealth. 
IV. Crippled Children 
“Although there are in the United States many thou- 
sands of crippled children, probably as many as there are 
of deaf and blind, little attention has been given them as 
a class. They are not even enumerated in the decennial 
Federal census. While special provision for the deaf and 
blind children is made in all States and for feeble-minded 
and incorrigible children in most of the States, few States 
make any special provision for the care and education of 
crippled children, and in only half a dozen cities are there 
separate schools or classes for them, and in the schools 
of most cities, towns, and rural districts not even suitable 
seats and desks are provided for them.” 18 
The problem of the crippled child would seem at first 
sight to present merely a question of transportation, but 
it is in fact also a further problem of school equipment, 
since the cripple frequently requires special seat and desk 
provisions, and is not capable of going up and down stairs. 
Furthermore, this problem involves very special curricular 
consideration since vocational opportunities for the crip- 
ple are so definitely limited by his physical condition. 
While some work has been done in this field and some 
cities are making provision for the care of crippled chil- 
dren, it is a disturbing fact that in comparison with the 
problem presented, very little work has as yet been done 
*US. Commissioner of Education P. P. Claxton, U.S. Bureau of 
Education Bulletin, 1918, No. 10. The failure to enumerate applies 
also to the census of 1920,
-P-A-G-E-210
194 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
for these children who presumably are possessed of aver- 
age ability to avail themselves of the opportunities of 
the common school. 
From our point of view, no child is crippled who can 
manage to get along under the ordinary conditions as 
they exist in school. We should disregard, too, the tem- 
porary, though most important work, of various State 
and city hospitals which, independently, or in conjunction 
with city Boards of Education, furnish instruction to 
crippled children. 
The most important problem involves those children 
who are permanently crippled, and living at home. These 
children cannot attend the regular city schools, and the 
work offered there is not always suitable to their future. 
If by special education is meant the effort to minimize 
a given handicap and to develop compensating abilities, 
these children must be the objects of very special provi- 
sion. On the physical side, these children need trans- 
portation facilities, special buildings to facilitate getting 
about, and to provide especially for the care of health; 
special equipment, such as suitable chairs and desks, ar- 
rangements for a midday meal, open-air recreation, and 
other phases of physical well-being. On the educational 
side we face the problem of the curriculum in terms of a 
future for these permanently crippled children, proper 
grading, and other problems. 
One most important fact regarding the present educa- 
tional status of cripples in the United States is that “a 
very high proportion of the crippled children attending 
special classes are unable to go beyond the grammar 
grades because the high schools offer no free transporta- 
tion by stage, and the buildings, often without elevators, 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 195 
have classrooms on several floors, which are not equipped 
with special seats or desks. . . . There are as yet no spe- 
cial high schools for cripples in the United States and no 
high-school buildings with any classrooms offering the 
accommodations needed by crippled children.” 17 
Residence State schools for cripples required.—In 
view of the fact that higher education of college and uni- 
versity grade is available for the deaf and blind, and of 
the further fact that large sums are being spent in the 
United States on the unpromising project of training the 
very dull and feeble-minded, it seems tragic that the 
physically crippled, presumably possessed of average in- 
telligence, should be practically barred from educational 
facilities beyond a given grade. It is obvious that special 
high schools cannot be established for them except pos- 
sibly in one or two of the largest cities in the country. 
This being the case, it seems reasonable to demand that 
institutions of State-wide character or, if necessary, na- 
tional institutions of that grade be established for these 
classes. In the case of the secondary and higher educa- 
tion of cripples, we obviously come to the point at which 
the American practice of local unit control in the public 
schools breaks down. The American States are now car- 
ing for the deaf and blind, and are spending large 
sums on the education of the feeble-minded and de- 
linquent, and the higher education of the crippled should 
no longer be neglected. The residence facilities of the 
various State institutions for the blind and the deaf which 
will come increasingly into disuse by the progress of city 
schools for these classes, may well be readapted in part, at 
least, for the higher education of cripples.

THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
  Summary 
The compulsory laws bring to school all of the children, 
including some hitherto neglected in the historic past 
because of the general neglect of such classes and failure 
to comprehend their potentialities, and in the immediate 
past because of the struggle to establish educational facil- 
ities for the masses of typical children. Democratic ideals 
demand equality of opportunity for all. Social economy 
demands the reduction of dependent classes to the lowest 
possible minimum. The method of simultaneous instruc- 
tion, even when supplemented by numerous devices which 
help to keep many partially non-typical children with the 
group, makes it impossible to educate with the group 
children of certain marked abnormalities. This presents 
the problem of special education. 
A non-typical child from our point of view is a child 
who cannot, by any device, be subjected to the typical 
procedure. Hence we exclude from this class many chil- 
dren hitherto included either because their deviation is 
temporary, such as retardation due to illness, transfer, 
language handicap; and many whose deviation, while 
permanent, can be overcome by devices such as slowing 
up the pace or lowering the requirements. 
For the really and permanently handicapped, who re- 
quire differentiated education, the theory is laid down 
that the basic principle guiding such education should be 
the endeavor to minimize and compensate the handicap 
and further, to educate for types of activity where this 
handicap matters least. 
The following classification is suggested: 
Mental deviation: (1) the most highly endowed; (2) 
the dullest of the normal group.
-P-A-G-E-213
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 197 
Temperamental deviation: (1) incorrigibles of normal 
intelligence; (2) speech defectives. 
Physical deviation: (1) blind; (2) deaf; (3) crippled. 
The four classes dealt with in the chapter are blind, 
deaf, speech defectives, and the crippled. 
Speech defects are probably in large measure due to 
nervous, temperamental causes, which will respond favor- 
ably to treatment which has as its aim the building up 
of confidence and giving the child conscious control of 
his speech mechanism, through breathing and deliberate- 
ness. The suggestion is made that these children be 
gathered in permanent full-time schools to replace the 
present system of part-time instruction in centers di- 
rected solely toward overcoming the speech defect. 
The blind and the deaf are at present cared for, very 
largely, in residential State institutions. This procedure 
is, however, being challenged, and a vigorous movement 
for the establishment of day classes and schools for the 
blind and deaf as part of the city systems is now in 
process. 
The education of crippled children has heretofore, to 
a great extent, been neglected. The children require 
special facilities for medical care; food during the day; 
buildings designed for easy getting about, and maximum 
of fresh air; special curriculum adjusted to their probable 
future; and, finally, transportation facilities. 
In the case of all these children we find again the 
familiar problems of: 
(1) Discrimination against children residing in rural 
districts. 
(2) The decreasing ability, even of urban centers, to 
furnish appropriate education, and the consequent need 
of consolidation at least for this purpose.
-P-A-G-E-214
  198 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
  (3) The drawback of cumbersome, detailed legisla- 
tion in the field of education and the need for discretion- 
ary power in the hands of administrative Boards. 
Problems 
Two important problems dealt with in this chapter, 
may well deserve further consideration. 
1. The meaning of typical and non-typical, and the 
proper differentiation between them. 
2. The correct principles underlying a general theory 
of the education of non-typical children; the proper classi- 
fication of non-typical children for purposes of instruc- 
tion still remains to be settled. 
8. The percentage of children suffering from defects 
of speech; the classification of these defects from the 
point of view of corrective educational treatment; the 
method of distinguishing between those requiring surgical 
or medical treatment, and those requiring educational 
training; the character of this training—these problems 
are still unsolved, and represent a challenge to the student 
of elementary education. 
4. The suggestion of this chapter that speech defec- 
tives be gathered in permanent, full-time schools, will 
not be met with universal agreement by students in this 
field. It represents a problem that may be worth 
discussing. 
5. In the field of the education of the blind and the 
deaf, the residential institution vs. the day school is still 
an open question. The exclusive use of the oral method 
as against the manual or the combined method in the 
education of the deaf is a problem too detailed and tech- 
nical for this chapter, but one in which the student may
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE PUPIL COMMUNITY—SOME NON-TYPICAL GROUPS 199 
be interested. The question is by no means settled or 
one-sided. 
6. The problems of proper compulsory periods and of 
consolidation for purposes of special education are of vital 
importance. 
7. In the field of the education of crippled children, 
the student will undoubtedly find a local survey and a 
study of the problems in that concrete form, of the 
greatest importance.

CHAPTER IX 
SOME PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATION 
In the chapter dealing with the work of the princi- 
pal, we classified the many activities which he carries 
on into three rather rough groupings; real educational 
work, work which grows out of the fact of the school’s 
particular location and patronage, and finally, a mass of 
duties primarily routine, which might possibly be per- 
formed by some one else and which he frequently per- 
forms merely because no assistance is supplied. 
The primarily educational problems with which, in 
accordance with the principles set down in the chapter 
referred to, the principal should be permitted to deal, 
and for which he should be equipped with an increasing 
amount of initiative and discretion, will occupy our at- 
tention for the several chapters that follow. With the 
routine and clerical work that the principal does merely 
in default of proper aid, we need not deal further. With 
the indefinite group of things which cannot be done by 
the untrained and unprofessional person—a group, never- 
theless, which cannot be performed by the central author- 
ities because of the nature of the case, since it is based 
in the very fact of particular location—we shall now deal, 
as well as with some general problems of administration 
which do not involve primarily instruction of the indi- 
vidual child.

It is in this field that we expect the great variation 
based on varying ability in leadership and in devotion 
and vision, and our expectation is not disappointed. 
Coming as we do to a point where ‘personality counts, in 
the building up of esprit de corps among teachers and of 
morale among pupils; in establishing cordial and help- 
ful relations with parents and local social agencies; in de- 
veloping processes to meet the needs of the particular 
community; we find large variation in the degree of suc- 
cess attained, even within the largest and best managed 
city school systems. 
The degree of variation is, however, no more marked 
than the almost total absence of standards and of ac- 
cepted procedure. We find ourselves in a field where, for 
the present, apprenticeship is everything, and formal 
training, so far as the specific activities are concerned, 
almost nothing. Scientific method has penetrated least 
of all into the daily detail work of the principal. Whether 
in the nature of things it can, or will, remains to be seen. 
It is almost hopeless to attempt an itemized list of 
duties. It would probably be futile. We shall content 
ourselves with five main topics; namely, unit of working 
group, unit of time, morale, non-curricular welfare and 
social activities, and neighborhood contacts. 
I. Unit of Working Group 
The school unit.—What is the proper size of a school 
unit? We find great range of practice, and the bases of 
decision are almost entirely considerations other than 
educational ones. The school community group ought in 
the first place to be homogeneous, if the working of the 
school as a unit is to have any educational value. Is the
-P-A-G-E-219
SOME PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATION 203 
group represented by the age range six to twelve homo- 
geneous? If this group is not sufficiently homogeneous 
for common purposes, may the fact be overcome by deal- 
ing with the school in two or three groups, or should 
actual school grouping be based on homogeneity? Is 
there a maximum size that properly makes for most per- 
fect efficiency representing a teaching-corps unit as well 
as a pupil unit and giving a principal the utmost op- 
portunity for completely satisfactory functioning? Is 
there a minimum number below which any of the things 
attainable by the school group unit cannot be efficiently 
achieved? 
There is so far no scientific information available to 
answer these questions. The number of children consti- 
tuting the group, the age range, the several factors which 
condition the possibility of a single individual to func- 
tion well as a principal, the desirable number of the teach- 
ing corps, departmentalization, curriculum enrichment, 
the character of the community in which the school is 
located—these are some but probably not all of the factors 
to be considered in the ultimate decision. It is entirely 
possible that present practice will not accord with ulti- 
mate organization. One may readily imagine, for ex- 
ample, many small two-grade schools located very near 
homes and sending children to more central and larger 
four-grade schools, just as the elementary school now 
sends its children to the junior high school, which in turn, 
feeds the most centrally located institution of all, the 
high school. 
The class unit.—We are equally in want of scientific 
information regarding the class unit. What is the proper 
number of children per teacher for maximum efficiency? 
     
-P-A-G-E-220
  
  204 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
The studies so far made! have confined themselves to 
establishing correlations between the number of pupils 
per class and the proportion of promotions, or the results 
attained in standard tests, an attack which fails to con- 
sider a number of most important factors. In the absence 
of scientific information, we have again mere experience. 
“The current view (in England) is that the best work can 
be done with an elementary class of thirty-five to forty.” 
On the other hand, “Dr. F. H. Hayward never tires of 
pleading for the large class in everything where stimulus 
and inspiration form parts of the essence of the teaching 
process.” 2 : 
Even the experience in this matter is not purely educa- 
tional, since it is always tempered by economic considera- 
tions. The method of group instruction “rests, in the first 
place, on economy.” * The number of pupils per teacher 
found in the best school systems varies from thirty to 
forty, and it is assumed that under perfect conditions a 
group of fifteen to thirty is the best with which to work. 
Classes of from forty to fifty and even more are not in- 
frequently found in the public schools. Accurate in- 
formation will have to be sought in this field. It must 
always be borne in mind that simultaneous instruction 
had its origin not in educational theory, but in financial 
considerations. In the case of the Christian Brothers as 
well as Bell and Lancaster it represented a brilliant

scheme whereby a method was evolved of teaching large 
numbers at small expense. The educational value of 
group instruction, real though it probably is, came as an 
afterthought. 
What are the educational values? Those ordinarily 
mentioned are rivalry, the development of codperation, 
training for working with one’s fellows. Freeman * re- 
fers to the mutual stimulation and adds that “there is 
much stronger incentive to intellectual activity in as- 
sociation with others than in solitary study.” He also 
notes as advantages of class instruction “the training 
which pupils receive in making social adjustment and in | 
learning to work codperatively with others, as well as 
the pleasure and satisfaction which they derive from their 
school association.” 
Undoubtedly there are other features making for 
superior efficiency in group work, found in the principles 
of social psychology, and involved in the operation of the 
gregarious instinct. One always has a feeling of con- 
fidence in the presence of one’s fellows, and doubt in their 
absence. Almost every one has experienced the doubt of 
judgment regarding a good play or exhibit witnessed in 
the presence of a very few, or of one’s own disapproval 
of something approved of by masses of his fellows. 
“What proportion of the ten thousand witnesses of a foot- 
ball match,” asks McDougall, “would stand for an hour 
or more in the wind and rain, if each man were isolated 
from the rest of the crowd and saw only the players?” * 
The gregarious instinct, he states, “is the root of no small 
part of the pleasure we find in attendance at the theater, 
* Ibid. 
“W. McDougall, An Introduction to Social Psychology, p. 89. 
(Luce & Co.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  206 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
at concerts, lectures, and all such entertainments. How 
much more satisfying is a good play if one sits in a well 
filled theater than if half the seats are empty.” 
From this point of view there is possibly a number 
below which efficiency in group instruction would begin 
to deteriorate. Hayward’s demand for large classes in 
certain subjects, on purely educational grounds, has al- 
ready been noted. This applies to teachers as well as to 
students. Every experienced instructor knows how dif- 
ficult it is to put forth maximum energy and enthusiasm 
in teaching a class that is too small, as well as he knows 
the hopelessness and confusion and discouragement in 
the presence of one that is too large. There is a class 
range which brings out maximum efficiency in the talented 
teacher. 
We shall have to determine scientifically what number 
brings out maximum effort on the part of the teacher 
and on the part of the pupils. Obviously this index will 
probably never be a single numerical stetement, for the 
minimum number of members per class must surely de- 
pend on many elements such as the age of the pupils; the 
subjects taught; the personal characteristics of the 
teacher; the intelligence status of the group as a whole, 
and the degree of variability within the group; the sub- 
ject and method of instruction involved; and the physical 
conditions, as for example, difference between a classroom 
and an excursion. And so, too, there must be some maxi- 
mum under all these conditions, beyond which the highest 
attainable efficiency is not possible. Of scientific informa- 
tion regarding the proper size of classes, as has been 
stated, there is almost none. Furthermore, in view of the 
organization and methods of instruction in our American 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  SOME PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATION 207 
schools, a determination of this fact must be postponed 
for some years. 
II. Unit of Time 
Should children attend school throughout the year, or, 
if not, what shall be the length of term? How long 
shall the school year be? How long shall the school day 
be? How shall the school day be broken up? What 
shall be the length of recess periods and the duration of 
periods of instruction? How shall the daily program, 
the distribution of subjects, be made? 
The problem of the program involving the length of 
the school year, the length of the school day, the number, 
length, and distribution of recesses, has so far received 
very little scientific study. Almost all of our practice 
is based merely on experience, and where there is legis- 
lation, this legislation represents the formulation of such 
experience. “After deducting holidays, the annual school 
term in most of our American cities is not more than 180 
days,” > but “lack of provision for adequate funds is per- 
haps the greatest hindrance to a longer school term.” 
Assuming funds sufficient to provide the facilities neces- 
sary, what are proper standards? 
Length of term.—Under current conditions two points 
will probably find educational thinkers in agreement, i.e. 
(1) that the elementary school ought to last six years, and 
hold the average child up to age twelve; and (2) that this 
school should ordinarily confine itself to the fundamental 
subjects. If these two principles are sound, it may be 
stated that the school year ought to be of such duration 
as is found scientifically necessary for the accomplishment 
*US. Bureau of Education Bulletin, 1917, No. 45.  
-P-A-G-E-224
  208 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
of this purpose by the average child. It would seem on 
the basis of this reasoning that mere economy of time is 
not involved. It might seem, too, that the length of the 
school year should vary in accordance with the native 
ability of the child. 
Some reasons, social rather than educational, are press- 
ing for the lengthening of the school year. “The effects 
of the long vacations have begun to excite serious appre- 
hension, and in many cities remedial action has been 
taken.” *® That is to say, summer sessions of elementary 
schools are now reported in more than two hundred cities. 
Other cities have organized all-year schools and report 
that the arrangement has “proved successful in every 
way.” In the instance referred to, the school was “located 
in the congested tenement districts where there is noth- 
ing for the children to do during the summer but loaf 
and fall into bad habits. The problem of street loafing 
in the tenement districts of Newark has very largely been 
solved by these all-year schools. Several] policemen re- 
port that they have had very little trouble with gangs of 
boys since the establishment of these schools, and that 
there are fewer accidents in the streets.” 
But these reasons are social rather than technically 
educational. For reasons discussed in another chapter, 
the school is increasingly replacing the home, and in that 
sense of nurture, these summer sessions and all-year 
schools are properly a phase of education. Their ex- 
istence, however, primarily for these motives, does not 
help to answer the question how much of the year we 
actually need for accomplishing our ends, and, assuming 
the suitability of the home, how much of yacation and of 
*US. Bureau of Education Bulletin, 1916, No. 42, p. 1. 
   
-P-A-G-E-225
SOME PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATION 209 
holiday the child requires and should have. There is very 
little medical information available regarding the de- 
sirability or value, or the proper length of school vaca- 
tions. Educational, social, recreational, developmental 
value they seem to have by common agreement and 
practice. What is more important, the time given to 
vacations is not needed for school work. 
If the principle holds that, for the present, the ele- 
mentary school should retain the child for six years and 
confine itself to the rudiments, the argument for saving 
time by longer school terms has little validity. We need 
only such sessions as are necessary to give the child his 
work from year to year. The idea of economizing time for 
the bright child is limited, too, by the need to wait for 
maturation. The school talks too much in terms of in- 
tellectual capacity, and too little in that group of charac- 
teristics, such as judgment, experience, and emotional 
aptitudes, which comprise maturity. We cannot simply 
save time. Even where the child can seemingly grasp 
what we have to teach, it is frequently wiser to wait for 
maturity to ripen and overtake intelligence. If, on other 
than instructional grounds, the longer year is forced on 
the school, the situation may perhaps be met by shorten- 
ing the day. 
More important and more interesting still, the long 
year and the long day, if insisted upon for social reasons, 
may be utilized for the educational welfare of the child 
by the deliberate introduction of time-consuming in the 
place of time-economizing methods. Efficiency is a 
dangerous fetish when applied to education. It has its 
limitations. Processes themselves have educational values 
as well as ends. Every one knows the superiority of 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
210 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
assisting the child to find things out over “telling” them 
tohim. Reading a book is better than reading a summary 
of it. Information secured for oneself slowly by means of 
excursions and personal investigation may be superior to 
the summaries and abstractions of the texts. The schools 
are beginning to recognize these educational facts. The 
problem and the project method, just coming into favor, 
involve excursions, investigations, and numerous other 
roundabout ways of achieving results. But the processes 
themselves have educational value. In these time-con- 
suming methods, then, may be found a means of combin- 
ing the desired length of year and of day with the definite 
limitations on mere rate of progress established by im- 
maturity and by other considerations. 
Length of day and of period of instruction.—In these 
matters of the proper length of day and of the period 
of instruction for any particular subject, we can only 
indicate a number of the factors that will ultimately 
assist in the establishment of standards. Psychological 
as well as physiological considerations will ultimately 
help to establish the most desirable length of day for 
the various age groups. The desirable length of year 
itself from the point of view of the social considerations 
enumerated above, may have bearing upon the question 
of whether the day shall be shorter or longer. The de- 
sirability of maintaining a long school year may auto- 
matically shorten the day. 
When we come to a consideration of the desirable 
length of the period of instruction for any particular sub- 
ject, we again face the physical problem of fatigue, the 
psychological problem of the possibility of maintaining 
interest and attention, or differences in taxing power as
-P-A-G-E-227
  SOME PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATION 211 
between subjects and teaching methods, all of which will 
naturally vary with the degree of maturity of the children 
under consideration. Ultimately, the period which pro- 
duces maximum efficiency will have to be determined for 
the various age groups. 
III. Non-Curricular Activities 
Under this head we come to a group of activities which 
take much of the principal’s time and attention, but re- 
garding which little can be said unless it be in the nature 
of relating personal experiences and methods tried and 
found to work—a procedure more suited to the educa- 
tional journals than to a volume properly confined to 
practices that have permanent validity based on principle. 
Musical organizations, school journals, photographic, 
literary, and other clubs can only be mentioned. The 
same applies to such worthy activities as savings banks, 
home gardening, and numerous valuable devices of a 
kindred sort. 
In the six-year school as we have conceived it, there 
should be no vocational work and, consequently, no vo- 
cational guidance. All of the children who leave the 
school will normally plan to enter the next unit and the 
over-age children unsuited to academic work who can 
nevertheless benefit by industrial training, should, by the 
wise recommendation of the Commission on the Reor- 
ganization of Secondary Education” be sent to the junior 
and senior high schools. Nevertheless, the principal who 
has a personal interest in his pupils, will be their 
counselor and friend. He will be called upon for guidance 
and advice. At the moment this responsibility is undoubt- 
™See Chapter II.
-P-A-G-E-228
  212 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
edly greater than the available technic for meeting it. An 
active group of students are interesting themselves in 
this field, a sizeable literature on the subject is develop- 
ing and, in time, the validity and the number of principles 
established will begin to measure up to the need and the 
expectations. 
School lunches, their need and the best mode of or- 
ganizing for them, are also now receiving attention in the 
literature to which attention is called in the bibliography. 
The well known student non-curricular activities, such 
as bands, boy scouts, athletics, must be mentioned and 
dismissed. The activities are important, but the pro- 
cedure has not been standardized. They vary in spirit 
and excellence with the character of the home back- 
ground, the principal, and the teaching corps. 
IV. Neighborhood Contacts 
The character of the relation with the community, too, 
varies with the people, the needs, and the personnel. 
This is one field in which no school system can demand 
uniformity, and in which excellence depends entirely on 
the devotion and on the personality of the principal. 
John and Evelyn Dewey describe most interesting and 
devoted work in Indianapolis;* while a principal in an- 
other city ® states it as his opinion that “in order to in- 
sure the fullest functioning of the school, it is important 
that constructive effort be employed to encourage full 
community codperation and understanding.” For his par- 
ticular district, he recommends that the typical at-

munity Needs. (University of Pennsylvania, 1920.)
-P-A-G-E-229
  SOME PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATION 213 
tendance officer should be replaced by a visiting teacher 
to devote her entire time to the problem of school and 
community relationship. ‘Her specific duties would in- 
clude investigation and elimination of unnecessary non- 
attendance, improvement of sanitary and general health 
conditions in homes and community, detailed follow-up 
work on the recommendations of the school physician 
and nurse as to the correction of physical defects, and 
the wise placement of pupils leaving school for work. 
She would act as intermediary between the community 
and the school, carrying the ideals of the school directly 
to the community, and fostering a constructive codpera- 
tion of social and civic organizations, as well as keeping 
the school in close touch with the currents of life in the 
community.” 
He recommends, too, that the school be “given over 
to the people.” He would have his school building “so 
planned that auditorium, cooking, sewing, manual arts, 
music, and play rooms are on the first floor and basement 
for easy access and use by the community in the eve- 
nings.” He would afford opportunities for “evening in- 
struction as well as for recreation, play, and social and 
civic gatherings.” He would provide for the children 
“direction and guidance during the summer months as 
well as at other times in the year” by means of a vacation 
school. In the ideal which he envisions, “the school must 
enter deeply into the lives of the people as well as into 
the lives of the children in order to become the great 
democratic socializing agency.” This is, after all, a 
problem which each principal must face for himself. It 
represents one of the opportunities which an executive 
possessed of initiative always covets.
-P-A-G-E-230
  214 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
V. Morale 
There are educational values to be derived in the school 
quite independently of class instruction and contact with 
classroom teachers. Doubtless the contacts, instruction, 
experience, and daily living of the school staff and the 
pupil community which make for that which we under- 
stand by morale, a fine spirit of codperation toward fine 
ends, are so numerous and so indefinable as to make cata- 
loguing an impossibility. We shall give some slight con- 
sideration to three phases, group undertakings, assemblies, 
and government. 
Group undertakings.—Common school enterprises of 
a worthy character, having civic and educational value, 
have much to commend them. The carrying on of com- 
mon school projects of large implication such as were 
developed during the war in the matter of Junior Red 
Cross, and savings for war loans, and of a more concrete 
neighborhood kind such as the carrying on of civic proj- 
ects, frequently furnish experience and instruction of a 
kind and in a manner not achievable through “subjects.” 
“There should always be some activity in which the 
school is taking an interest,” says Freeland1° Assisting 
the Red Cross by salvaging newspapers, participating in 
general community celebrations, raising funds by per- 
sonal effort for some common good, such as financing a 
day-nursery or milk fund, or purchasing a musical instru- 
ment, undertaking to clean up the immediate neighbor- 
hood, or to petition a municipal body for necessary as- 
sistance—these and the numerous other group under-

(Macmillan, 1920.)
-P-A-G-E-231
SOME PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATION 215 
takings described in the educational journals have much 
to commend them. In addition to their value for the in- 
dividual child, they make for beneficial cohesiveness, 
loyalty and codperation within the group. They train, 
on their level of maturity, for the virtues so essential in 
the citizens of a democracy. 
However, there are limitations and dangers. Every 
practical school man knows the pressure that is constantly 
being brought to bear on the school to interest itself in 
activities which, beneficial though they may be to the 
community, and disinterested though the proponents of 
such activities may be, have no educational value. There 
are cases to be found where at certain times the stress of 
participation in general community affairs is such that 
the education of the child becomes a secondary matter. 
Carefully preserved data running through a school year 
and indicating the amount of time given up for such pur- 
poses by children, would at times probably shock school 
men. It seems to be clear that one principle that might 
safely be laid down in this connection is that no activity 
regardless of its general beneficence should be permitted 
in the school unless it has at the same time definitely 
ascertainable specific educational value of some type. 
Again, unless such activity is definitely associated with a 
phase of classroom work being carried on, the amount of 
time and energy available must be held in bounds, even 
though the activity have general educational value. Not 
only do outside activities tend to militate against the gen- 
eral educational progress of the school; such activities as 
the school itself carries on, as for example, exhibitions for 
advertising purposes and inter-school rivalry, in the 
matter of athletics, building up the so-called school

loyalty and school spirit, must be held in check and tested 
by the simple principle of the educational welfare of each 
individual child. 
Assemblies.—Every school holds assemblies, gives 
school entertainments, celebrates special days and events, 
acts as a group, works and thinks as a unit. It must be 
said again that in connection with this topic we rely al- 
most exclusively on current practice developed by ex- 
perience rather than by any scientific determination. 
Some philosophic thinking there has been in this field, 
but. of objectively demonstrable principles, there are 
practically none. Professor Ernest Horn,1! in a descrip- 
tion of Speyer School assemblies, enumerates values 
which in his opinion resulted from these assemblies that 
may perhaps be taken as ideals to be attained by all 
projects of this kind. He says that they were conducted 
throughout on the responsibility of the children, that they 
were participated in by all grades; and that they were in- 
variably a natural outgrowth of some part of the regular 
work, so that they did not require unusual preparation. 
They did not represent an artificial atmosphere and 
were not “pieces” that the children spoke. He states that 
the work was well motivated; that it operated to put 
children at ease; that it enabled them to express them- 
selves before large groups; that it developed responsi- 
bility, codperation, unity, and actually accomplished the 
goal of interesting and entertaining the audience.

sembly, which he considers “a valuable instrument for 
the fixing of ideals and the establishment of esprit de

corps” enumerates eight different activities as follows: 
(1) recitations by pupils; (2) discussion by pupils of cur- 
rent events; (3) studies of pictures and other objects of 
art; (4) musical studies of all kinds; (5) celebration of 
special days; (6) flag drills and other distinctively 
patriotic exercises; (7) outside speakers; (8) motion 
pictures. 
Professor Bagley 1% considers that assemblies “offer an 
opportunity to give explicit instructions in matters that 
are not touched upon in the regular work of the school,” 
and that “they offer an opportunity to begin the work of 
the day upon a high plane.” 
Enough has been said to indicate that the educational 
value of assemblies, their goals and the proper methods of 
attaining these goals still remain to be studied by objec- 
tive methods. 
School government.—Finally, we come to the matter 
of school government—the actual discipline and control 
of the group for their best educational welfare. “The 
problem of ‘discipline,’ the term used to encompass the 
whole range of the pupils’ moral development, 
scholastically considered, is probably the most perplex- 
ing that confronts a principal.” 1+ “School government 
and discipline are terms properly used,” says Dr. Davis, 
“to include a host of situations in which unsocial or 
antisocial tendencies impede the organized activity of the 
school group, and have to be met by measures more or 
less apart from the regular life of the school, and conse- 
quently somewhat wasteful.” 1°

Dr. Davis, are: first, to insure each member of the group 
an opportunity to perform advantageously the work as- 
signed, without hindrance or distraction from other 
pupils; secondly, to develop habits and ideals of social 
behavior and self-control which will function in later sit- 
uations. Dr. Davis notes five principal sources of dis- 
cipline difficulty: (1) instinctive tendencies of children 
out of harmony with the school situation; (2) influ- 
ences of some homes against the work of the schools; (3) 
popular educational principles misunderstood and carried 
too far and mischievously applied; (4) mischief-inspir- 
ing school organization; (5) the teacher as the cause of 
school trouble. He also enumerates five essential ele- 
ments under the maintaining of school morale: (1) The 
school must have an organized routine. (2) Work should 
be initiated strongly and with a plan. (3) The element 
of persistence and consistency should be borne in mind. 
(4) Pupils should be held to the obligations of the school 
situation. (5) The actual academic scholarship and 
ability of the teacher dealing with the pupil are of utmost 
importance. 
Undoubtedly the matter of discipline is based on as- 
sumed ideal standards of conduct which we expect of © 
children; but what are these proper ideals of conduct? 
Surely they ought not to be arbitrarily set up. They 
ought to be formulated in terms of childhood rather than 
in terms of maturity. We have traveled far since the days 
when the school was the hated means of driving the child, 
and the “lazy fool was whipped at school.” Is it too much 
to expect that ultimately we shall establish objective 
norms of the conduct that may be expected from the aver- 
age child at typical age periods? Here again, it must be
-P-A-G-E-235
SOME PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATION 219 
that social psychology studying individual behavior with- 
in the group will ultimately make its contribution toward 
a definite principle of school discipline, because it is 
obvious that the individual does not act when alone as 
he acts in the company of a large group of his fellows. 
Again, it is probable that the large prevalence of dull- 
ness and feeble-mindedness that has repeatedly been 
found among delinquent children indicates a definite re- 
lationship between school government and the intelligence 
of those who present the greatest school problems. It will 
not be possible much longer to discuss the matter of school 
discipline without regard to the question of intelligence. 
City-school principals know full well that the problem 
of governing their schools as between sections of the city 
varies greatly. It has been assumed that this is due 
largely to the fact of the different economic, educational, 
and social conditions of the average homes from which 
the children come. But the fact of the matter is that 
social, economic, and educational status is itself to a cer- 
tain degree an indication of intelligence. Some children 
come from such homes because, always with numerous ex- 
ceptions, they are the children of less intelligent persons 
and have probably inherited a lower degree of intelligence. 
It is safe to say that we shall not be on scientific ground 
in this matter of discipline until we study it carefully in 
relation to intelligence. 
Summary 
This chapter deals with six main phases of elementary- 
school administration, largely in the hands of the prin- 
cipal, and representing problems regarding which we have 
few scientific data. Practice in this field rests, therefore,
-P-A-G-E-236
  220 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
largely on tried experience, on tradition, and varies with 
the personality of the leaders. 
I. A consideration of the problem of the optimum 
working group involves the question of the most desir- 
able number for (1) the school, and (2) the class. The 
first of these problems raises the question (a) of homo- 
geneity from the point of view of age—whether the six- 
twelve age range properly constitutes a unified working 
group; (b) of the desirable number of the pupil group 
from the point of view of morale, and the teaching staff 
from the point of view of esprit de corps; and (c) of the 
number and size beyond which the possibility of effective 
leadership on the part of the principal would begin to 
decrease. The question of the proper size of the class 
involves a complete discussion and scientific discovery 
of the values of group instruction, in order to determine 
the maximum and minimum numbers in relation to age, 
intelligence, subject, method, teacher, and other factors, 
for the best results. On both of these problems we are 
at present without accurate data. They remain to be 
studied. 
II. In the matter of the unit of time, the question of 
the most desirable length of year, day, and period, we 
again find practice based rather on tradition than on prin- 
ciple. The tendency to lengthen the year and to establish 
a summer session finds support in social, rather than in 
educational, needs. The general feeling that the longer 
the term the greater the educational opportunity, has its 
limitations. If, as is agreed, the elementary school is to 
endure six years and confine itself to the rudiments, then 
the work may proceed too fast for the child’s best inter- 
ests. Maturity, too, which may lag behind intellectual
-P-A-G-E-237
SOME PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATION 221 
development, may call a halt. “Saving time” and “cov- 
ering ground” have definite limitations as arguments for 
the longer year and the longer day. 
In general, the length of the year may be governed by 
the time required for the accomplishment of the standard 
work by the average child. If, for reasons other than 
educational, a long year is desirable, the day may be 
shortened or time-consuming in place of time-saving 
methods may be deliberately adopted. 
III. The non-curricular activities which demand the 
attention of the principal in his dealings with the pupil 
group as a whole are, to enumerate but part of the total, 
musical organizations, the school paper, photographic, 
literary, and other clubs, savings banks, home gardens, 
guidance, school lunches, boy scouts, athletics. 
IV. Neighborhood contacts, involving organization 
of and codperation with parents’ associations, civic or- 
ganizations, social agencies of every type, and direct visit- 
ing of individual homes by teachers assigned to this task, 
all in the interest of the pupil community, occupy a large 
or small amount of time and energy, varying with the 
character of the community and the personality of the 
principal. 
V. Under the general heading of morale we have dis- 
cussed the ways in which the principal works for unity 
and educational codperation in his school. By means of 
group undertakings of many kinds which have educa- 
tional values to recommend them, the children strive to- 
gether for common ends. By means of stimulating as- 
semblies, entertainments, celebrations, they learn to think 
together about things not so valuably brought out in the 
individual class, and develop a sense of ideals and of cit-
-P-A-G-E-238
222 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
izenship. In handling the inescapable problems of school 
government, the principal faces opportunities for educa- 
tional service which frequently belong more to the school 
than to the individual teacher. 
Problems 
Practically every subhead in this chapter is an index 
to a set of unsettled questions in the field of elementary 
education. A number of these follow: 
1. What number of children constitute an ideal work- 
ing unit for elementary-school purposes? 
2. What is the ideal size of an elementary-school 
class? 
8. What is the ideal length of the school year? 
4. How many hours constitute the ideal school day; 
how many minutes constitute the ideal working or lesson 
period; and how may the school day best be divided? 
5. Make a study of local usage in the matter of as- 
semblies. Make a list of the educational values to be 
sought and, on this basis, of the errors to be avoided. 
6. Plan a set of assemblies for one-half year in a six- 
grade school.

CHAPTER X 
THE CLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS FOR PURPOSES OF 
INSTRUCTION 
Simultaneous instruction an established method.— 
Modern school procedure everywhere is characterized by 
the method of simultaneous instruction. Obvious and in- 
escapable as it may appear to-day, “the very familiar 
plan of class recitation as a systematic method, the es- 
sential feature of all modern schools, was first brought 
into general use by the Brethren of the Institute,” little 
more than two hundred years ago. Class instruction, 
then, is a modern invention after all.) In the preceding 
centuries education was carried on by the very wasteful 
individual method whereby(the teacher called up one 
child at a time for instruction} the others meanwhile being 
left to their own initiative. In English-speaking coun- 
tries the group system, popularized by Dr. Andrew Bell 
and Joseph Lancaster, both of England, is not more than a 
century old. It was in fact the monitorial system of these 
school men, demonstrating as it did the possibility of 
mass education without unduly burdening the taxpayer, 
that assisted in the development of free public schools in 
America.?

228 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
In view of the power of existing institutions to con- 
tinue to exist by virtue of mere inertia regardless of 
merit; indeed, in view of the ability of these institutions 
to find excuses for their perpetuation regardless of the 
original causes, it is important for the progress of modern 
education as well as for the freer discussion of proposals 
to reorganize the grouping which exists in the public 
schools to-day, to note two important things: first, that 
simultaneous instruction, and particularly the form it has 
assumed, of grade instruction, is a comparatively new and 
recent institution; secondly, that the original reasons for 
and arguments in favor of this device were economic 
rather than educational) The invention of this obvious 
feature of education was, of course, of tremendous im- 
portance in the development of free schools, since the 
expensiveness of individual instruction would practically 
have precluded the development of mass education. 
“The traditional methods of instruction were so waste- 
ful,”/s says Parker, {‘that children would attend school for 
years and get only a smattering of reading and writing.” 
Nevertheless, it is to be noted that the new device was 
one! for the more economical use of the teacher, and for 
the saving of money, rather than for any educational 
values claimed in its favor. It is true, of course, that in 
due season it was discovered that in addition to its eco- 
nomic features, class instruction possessed certain edu- 
cational values.® 
There can hardly be any question as to the advantages 
to be derived from simultaneous instruction. Just what

struction see J. B. Sears, Classroom Organization and Control, Chapter 
X (Houghton Mifflin, 1918), and G. E. Freeland, Modern Elementary 
School Practice, Chapter XIV (Macmillan, 1920).
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE CLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS FOR INSTRUCTION 229 
these advantages are, however, and what the optimum 
size of the group may be, still remain to be scientifically 
determined, as was noted in the last chapter. Whatever 
these advantages may be, whatever disadvantages there 
may be involved, no one can question the fact that simul- 
taneous instruction has come to stay. (The question with 
which modern education is struggling, however, is the 
form that this method shall assume. (In other words, on 
what basis shall groups be formed in order to produce a 
maximum of homogeneity and, conversely, the minimum 
of friction and hindrance to good teaching? 
Grouping by grade an inadequate procedure.—Ameri- 
can schools have developed one type of simultaneous in- 
struction which is too frequently confused with that form 
of instruction itself; namely, the system of grade group- 
ing. (“The chief basis of classification has grown out of 
the grading system, and this in turn has depended upon 
age as its basis.) The time of entrance upon school work, 
the time of promotion, and the time of graduation have 
been based fundamentally on chronological age.” The 
fact ought to be ever so clearly understood that the 
antithesis is not between grade instruction and individual 
instruction. In other words, the method of grouping by 
grades is not the only means of applying and taking ad- 
vantage of the means known as simultaneous instruction. 
However great may be the desirability and usefulness of 
simultaneous instruction, the units of organization need 
by no means be grades representing, as they do almost en- 
tirely, the number of years in school. Homogeneity for 
the purpose of grouping for simultaneous instruction

will involve such factors as the nature of the child, cur- 
ricular objectives, and many other features to be noted 
as we go on in the discussion, far more complex and far 
finer in their methods of dividing and segregating for 
purposes of instruction than the rough method of “grad- 
ing,” involving as that method does, years in school, 
chronological age, and other features determinable 
almost entirely by the calendar. “ 
How comparatively unimportant a factor chronological 
age is as an index for education, has been amply illus- 
trated by the findings of recent psychological studies: 
Beginning with the new point of view originated by 
Alfred Binet, the concept of mental age is gradually 
replacing mere number of years of existence as an in- 
finitely more meaningful index of intellectual status. But 
mental age is not the only index of differentiation. In 
every important phase of development, growth is marked 
by a notable lack of uniformity as between individuals, 
and mere age is becoming of ever decreasing value as a 
basis for deductions regarding educability. 
Old_age, it has been said, is a physiological condition 
rather than an accumulation of years) Some men are 
older at fifty than others at eighty. Apparently there is 
definite scientific ground for speaking of anatomical age. 
“The variation in the mental ability of ten-year-old chil- 
dren,” says Professor Woodrow,’ “large as it is, is almost 
equaled by that in anatomical age. Measured by what- 
ever index, the anatomical ages of ten-year-old children 
distribute themselves over a distance which it takes the 
average child five or six years to traverse. ... In re-

(Lippincott, 1919.)
-P-A-G-E-247
THE CLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS FOR INSTRUCTION 231 
gard to pubescence (to cite the variability of one of the 
indices) Crompton has found that some boys cross this 
landmark of physical development as early as the age 
of twelve and a half, while others do not do so before the 
age of seventeen and a half to eighteen. . . . It is well 4 
known that girls reach the age of puberty on the average 
about two and a half years earlier than boys.). . . It 
is not so commonly realized that this difference between 
the sexes in anatomical age is well marked by the end of 
the first year of life, and that it is present in ever in- 
creasing degree from the first year up to and beyond the 
age of puberty.” ; 
Here, then, we have another factor which makes 
chronological age as a basis of classification impractical 
for purposes of instruction. There are many others: 
When history is taught the child with a view to develop- 
ing patriotism, love of country, devotion, admiration of 
noble and heroic deeds, the object is to secure an emo- 
tional response. But undoubtedly children differ in the 
rate and intensity of emotional development. Again, we 
may teach a subject in which progress demands not 
merely comprehension, but the exercise of judgment, as 
for example, the desirability or undesirability of the com- 
mission form of city government. Doubtless children 
differ in the rate and intensity with which they develop 
judgment and a number of other factors which, for the 
present, go by the general name maturity. Complete re- 
sponse to the stimuli offered by the school may definitely 
involve maturity. 
In the field of history, for example, it is easily shown 
what a fallacy it is to assume that education calls merely 
on intellect. A very young child may be able to memorize 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  232 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
the details of such a series of events as the Conference of 
Versailles, which followed the Great War; he may have 
the emotional capacity to take on the teacher’s or the 
parental and the community’s point of view regarding that 
conference—a point of view which would naturally differ 
with geographical location, and would probably not be 
the same in France as in Germany. If he were very 
young, however, he would probably lack the maturity 
necessary to pass judgment on these events and, lacking 
that, he would hardly be in a position completely to 
understand the historical facts. And history is not the 
only example that can be cited. In literature, for ex- 
ample, the degree of maturity of the reader absolutely 
conditions response. 
And so we come to a point in which we see that if we 
are to abandon subject-matter mastery as a goal, and the 
ah implantation of a teacher’s prejudice as an ideal, 
{if we are really to have education as a rounded develop- 
ment of all the faculties, it will be necessary to make a 
more thorough study than has ever yet been made of the 
child subject to training, and to adjust school work to the 
realities discovered by experimental psychology.) Quite 
conceivably, there are emotional and maturity ages. 
Whether these ages are susceptible of acceleration as is 
the case with the so-called pedagogical age, or not sus- 
ceptible at all, and definitely fixed in potentiality as is 
the case with ultimate mental age, we do not know. 
In the face of these many phases of variation, the prob- 
lem of homogeneity for purposes of instruction becomes 
complicated indeed. It has become clear that homo- 
geneity on the basis of chronological age is an impos- 
sibility, if only on account of the established variation in
-P-A-G-E-249
  THE CLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS FOR INSTRUCTION 233 
mental endowment—a point to which we shall return in 
a later section. When to this are added the facts of 
possible variation in emotional capacity still to be dis- 
covered, and the known variation in anatomical develop- 
ment between individuals and between the sexes, as well 
as the unknown but surely existing variation in the de- 
velopment of what may be called for want of finer dis- 
crimination, maturity, it is easy to realize how crude has 
been our grouping of children for purposes of instruction. 
What is very clear, however, is the fact that grouping 
children merely on the basis of the elapsing of time from 
birth, is far from adequate.’ 
This method becomes glaringly inefficient when, dis- 
regarding all variation in rate of development and of ulti- . 
mate achievement, \we base our whole educational organ- 
ization on this simple factor—eight years for elementary 
school, four years of high school, four years of college) Is 
it not possible that the future holds an age of educability 
which will include data on development of the intellect, 
emotions, moral judgment, maturity, and anatomical de- 
velopment? The reference is not to pedagogical age, 
which now means attained ability in standard subjects, 
but to schoolable age, which will be an index to the child’s 
ability to work in the various fields of the school. The 
establishment of more exact homogeneity for purposes of 
instruction, and the real differentiation of instruction in 
curriculum and method adapted to the several groups, 
represent the greatest contribution which this generation 
of teachers has to make to public education. 
Inadequacy of proposed remedies.—Even before the 
exact findings of current psychological studies concerning 
the great variation in endowment of the pupil population,
-P-A-G-E-250
  234 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
school men had become aware of the futility of classifi- 
cation on the basis of age. But instead of starting boldly 
de novo and without any tradition whatever to determine 
the best method of grouping children for instructional 
purposes, we have now for something more than fifty 
years been endeavoring to tinker with the old method as 
if its continued existence were inevitable, as if grade 
grouping and simultaneous instruction were synonymous, 
and the advantages of the latter could not as well be at- 
tained by grouping on any basis whatever. 
( Dr. W. T. Harris, then Superintendent of Schools in 
St. Louis, noted as long as fifty years ago the hopeless in- 
flexibility of the grade system, which threw children to- 
gether merely on the basis of approximate equality of 
chronological age, and held them together for an entire 
year, when the most promising were sent on and the worst 
pupils were held back and compelled to repeat everything 
and work another year, before an opportunity to advance 
was given them) His method of solving the problem con- 
sisted in the establishment of/ (more frequent classification} 
The general effect of this was to produce a semiannual 
promotion period almost everywhere in the country; and 
many cities, as St. Louis itself, promote more frequently 
than that. 
This attempted solution by reclassification, the first of 
several methods to be noted for mitigating the inflexi- 
bility of the grade system, is probably the best of them; 
but it is also to be noted that the fundamental need for 
this frequent reclassification arises from the fact that the 
original grouping was not based on any test of homo- 
geneity. Why must the schools continually keep on re- 
shuffling the children and trying to adapt them to the 
rigidity of the eight-grade grouping as if the calendar-
-P-A-G-E-251
THE CLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS FOR INSTRUCTION 235 
year system were unalterably basic? Granting the in- 
evitability and indeed the utility of the principle of 
simultaneous instruction, why should we not contemplate 
a complete reconsideration of groups in terms of new and 
real units of homogeneity? In a large number of cities 
reporting promotion of individuals within the term, we 
have a costly and exceedingly clumsy method of readjust- 
ment./ In one city, for example, more than three thousand 
children are given special promotions each semester} Al- 
though this method is followed in the name of progressive 
education, enabling, as it does, the brighter children to 
save time, it must appear exceedingly crude, when one 
realizes that the readjustments would not be necessary 
were the original grouping more in accord with what we 
know to-day of the variation among children. 
Besides the St. Louis method of frequent reclassifica- 
tion and the similar method now largely in vogue of 
special promotion of individual children in the intervals 
between general reclassification,we may note three other 
attempts to mitigate the evil of the grade system.) These 
three attempts may be designated as the: (1) equality 
of course and variability of progress; (2) equality of 
progress and variability of course; and (3) special at- 
tention to individuals within the group. 
These various methods of mitigating the evils of the 
grading system by accommodation to it as basic rather 
than abandoning it, have been carefully described by 
Holmes and other writers in some detail and need not 
detain us here.* Briefly stated, the method of equal 
course with varying speed, particularly illustrated by the

practice of such cities as Cambridge and Portland, Ore- 
gon, represents the work of the eight years of the elemen- 
tary school organized in such a way and in such groups 
and providing for such means of shifting from group to 
group as to allow a term ranging from six or seven to 
eight or nine years for the completion of the course, 
in this way presumably taking care of the varying types 
of ability. The same amount of work is provided for 
all, but(the organization is so flexible as to allow each 
person to approximate the maximum rate of which he is 
capable. (The method that has been referred to as equal 
progress but varying course is commonly known as the 
Santa Barbara method,) and is organized on the theory 
that all children should be kept in school not less than 
and no more than the standard eight years.) In order to 
accomplish this result the amount of work demanded is 
adjusted to the apparent ability of the child; the school 
being organized for three types of ability ranging from 
the minimum or core studies through average to more 
than avérage demands. The children progress through 
the grades at the rate of one year to each grade, but the 
brighter do more and the duller do less than the average 
grade standard. 
The system of working with the individual has at least 
two phases: (The one commonly known as the Batavia 
Plan involves very large classes in charge of two teachers, 
one going about to assist individual pupils who have dif- 
ficulty, while the other is teaching the class as a whole, 
(The other system is the one in use at the San Francisco 
- State Teachers’ College, where a number of children of 
approximate ability in charge of one teacher are pre- 
sumably going each at his own rate of progress} following

the directions in a Bulletin especially prepared for the 
purpose and reporting to the teacher at stated intervals 
and at other times if assistance is required. There are 
under this last-named arrangement, no stated periods of 
reclassification at all, but the material to be covered is 
presumably the usual content of the eight-grade school— 
an extreme extension of the basic principle of the 
Cambridge plan.” 
All of these efforts to mend the obvious inefficiencies 
of the present system of grouping children for the pur- 
pose of instruction have certain common patent defects: 
(1) They assume that the eight-grade system of 
classification, based, as it is, largely on chronological age 
and on arbitrary calendar units without regard to the 
nature of children, is inevitable and must be adjusted to 
rather than abolished. 
(2) They assume that all children can accomplish 
the work ordinarily done in the eight grades and that the 
only difference between them is the rate at which this 
work can be done, totally ignoring the existence of pri- 
mary qualitative differences in ability. Even the Santa 
Barbara plan provides for doing the core of all the work, 
presumably doing less in order to graduate all the chil- 
dren in eight years—a theory which would imply that the 
variation is quantitative, showing itself in rate of prog- 
ress and not qualitative, which would mean inability to 
do the work at all. 
(3) They assume that almost the entire school popu- 
lation require the same type of education. The so-called

238 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Santa Barbara method does not provide for true quali- 
tative differentiation. The various goals of accom- 
plishment provided for are basically of the same 
type. 
(4) They totally ignore the fact that an unselected 
section of the population grouped together merely on the 
basis of similarity in chronological age cannot be ef- 
ficiently instructed. They do not make provision for the 
fact that no matter how frequent the reclassification dur- 
ing the period of instruction, the teacher of such an un- 
selected group will inescapably deal with the average 
ability of the group, leaving the dullest portion inevitably 
behind, and the most brilliant portion hopelessly un- 
stimulated, unoccupied, and untaught. 
Differentiated education as well as homogeneity is 
needed.*+Simultaneous instruction cannot, and indeed 
ought not to be abolished} The problem involved in 
simultaneous instruction is a problem of homogeneity of 
grouping.) The method of grouping by grades has cer- 
tainly, in the present state of scientific information re- 
garding the variation in child ability, been outworn. A 
new method of organizing homogeneous groups for the 
purpose of instruction must be devised. 
The utter unsuitability of grouping children for the 
purpose of instruction on the basis of mere chronological 
age may be noted from the following facts found by some 
of Professor Terman’s students, all of which are probably 
* While it is not the province of a book on the general principles of 
elementary education to go into the details of modern differential 
psychology, some acquaintance with the findings and terminology must, 
however, be assumed as indispensable for the reader. The uninitiated

as well as The Measurement of Intelligence, and to H. Woodrow,

THE CLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS FOR INSTRUCTION 239 
typical of American schools everywhere:® Among 112 
kindergarten children there was found a mental age range 
from 3 years, 4 months, to 7 years, 7 months, and the 
range in I.Q. from 61 to 152 is one “from feeble-minded- 
ness to very unusual superiority”—and one teacher is 
asked to adapt her work for this group to simultaneous 
instruction! In the case of 150 first-grade children, there 
was found a range in mental age “from 3 years to prac- 
tically 11 years.” “The highest mental age among these 
first-grade pupils considerably overlaps the lowest we 
have found in the eighth grade,” says Dr. Terman. The 
range in I.Q. was from 45 to 145. In the 79 fifth-grade 
children studied, the mental age ranged from 734 to 15 
years, and the I.Q. from 60 to 148. 
It is clear in view of these facts that grade group- 
ing involving, as it does, grouping on the basis of 
attained chronological age is a futile, outgrown method, 
which cannot be made any longer usable, by the various 
devices described, intended to hold it up. What then is 
the true basis of homogeneity for purposes of instruc- 
tion? The answer must be emphatically that if the 
school is to continue to offer a qualitatively undifferen- 
tiated course of study, there can never be any true basis 
of homogeneity. Dealing though we are with the ques- 
tion of grouping children for purposes of work, we must 
for the moment step over the boundary and into the field 
of course of study. If children differ qualitatively in 
their ultimate potentiality there is no method whatever 
of grouping them in such a way as to assist them in

  240 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
accomplishing the same or approximately the same ob- 
jectives. 
The suggestion frequently made that children be 
graded in terms of mental age instead of chronological 
age is too easy, too ready-made a solution. This sugges- 
tion is, once again, based on the presumed inevitability 
of the calendar method of classification. Why “grade” 
children at all? At best, such regrading by “special pro- 
motion,” disregarding for the moment the clumsiness of 
adjustment, the gaps in continuity involved in skipping, 
the utter heterogeneity involved from the point of view 
of maturity, provides for quantitative approximation— 
for rate of progress over the same ground. 
But children differ qualitatively. The variation in in- 
telligence quotient indicates not merely a quantitative 
difference in rate of development, but qualitative differ- 
ence in ultimate development. Consequently the work 
set for accomplishment must be differentiated. We must 
abolish the single course of study, slightly swelled for 
the brighter and attenuated for the duller. This quan- 
titative differentiation will no longer do. We must avail 
ourselves of the scientific information at hand. We must 
realize that the difference between the extremes is 
enormous, and that if we are to act on the theory that 
democracy means equality of opportunity, we must tax 
each type of ability to its utmost capacity. 
“Our schools are failing miserably to solve the big 
problem of individual differences. Hither we must resort 
to the instruction of pupils in homogeneous groups, or 
be driven to an individual system of instruction.” 1°

THE CLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS FOR INSTRUCTION 241 
What then is the true basis of homogeneity? For school 
purposes, homogeneity of pupil grouping must be created 
partly in terms of differentiation of goals. Having dif- 
ferentiated the ends to be accomplished and having, 
indeed, established types of study in the schools in place 
of the present school grades as achievement goals, we 
must use the methods at hand for the purpose of dif- 
ferentiating and dividing into several groups the children 
who present themselves for instruction. An entirely new 
era lies before us. 
Ultimate principles of homogeneity and differentiated 
education we cannot establish, since we are not prepared 
to isolate and measure all the factors involved, such as 
emotion and maturity. Even physiological age must wait 
until we understand its significance more clearly, although 
at one point, the entering age, it may well replace 
chronological age and supplement mental age now. 
For the present we must group children and differen- 
tiate educational ends and processes on the basis of the 
one quality which we know how to measure with a high 
degree of accuracy—intelligence. Objectives will be set 
down in terms of what is approximately attainable by 
the groups as ‘scientifically determined. “An ideal pro- 
cedure will first ascertain the mental level of the child, 
then the level of intelligence necessary to master each 
school subject, and finally will fit the two together.” 4 
It is to be noted then that this problem of classification 
in view of modern scientific knowledge can no longer be 
handled alone. It is primarily and fundamentally a cur- 
ricular as well as a grouping problem. Ultimate group-

ing will have to be in terms of attainable goals. The 
work to be accomplished will not run along parallel lines 
of rate of progress as in the Santa Barbara plan; or 
parallel lines of varying duration toward ultimate identity 
of accomplishment as in the Cambridge plan. Indeed, 
the grouping will eventually be deliberately made for 
purposes of divergent rather than parallel goals, and 
always in terms of ultimate ability as scientifically 
determined. 
Two possibilities of adjustment are available, namely: 
In terms of mental age, or in terms of I.Q. A grouping 
on the basis of mental age presents momentary homo- 
geneity of persons totally different in ultimate capacity, 
a homogeneity that ceases to exist almost at the moment 
when the group is brought together. A grouping on the 
basis of I.Q. presents a group varying in mental age 
but homogeneous from the point of view of ultimate 
capacity—a really like group, the individuals of which 
have arrived at varying stages of a quite similar course 
that is being traveled by all. While curriculum units and 
school possibilities at various stages will have to be de- 
termined in terms of mental age, the group itself will 
undoubtedly have to be made up on the basis of 1.Q. 
It must be clear that classification made for the purpose 
of varying rate of progress is fundamentally not possible. 
Variation of quantity, giving the duller group the core 
and the brighter group more material of the same kind, 
is a more apparent than real adjustment. There is a 
great difference between those children who are poten- 
tially capable of full ultimate inheritance of the racial 
culture and those not so capable. The time has come 
for qualitative differentiation of a radical sort. We must
-P-A-G-E-259
    THE CLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS FOR INSTRUCTION 243 
have school systems instead of a school system. We must 
recognize the existence of an aristocracy of intellect. 
Democracy consists in the equality of opportunity for 
all to develop to their ultimate capacity. 
Dangers inherent in a unitary system of education.— 
For some years we have been bending our energies to 
improve the holding power of the public schools, to pre- 
vent the dropping out from school during the upper- 
grade years of large numbers of the population, and to 
increase the percentage of those who persist through the 
high schools. Our efforts have been rewarded. The in- 
crease in high-school attendance within the quarter- 
century, the growth of the high-school idea and, in con- 
sequence, the overwhelming increase in college enrollment 
are all too well known to need elaboration here. 
All of this is, socially, of the highest value. But it 
involves disadvantages which were not realized at the 
beginning of the drive for a longer period of schooling 
for a larger proportion of the population, which should 
not be blinked. The larger the percentage of the popula- 
tion retained for the upper grades, the high school, and 
the college, the lower the average capacity of the group 
under instruction. The lower the average degree of in- 
telligence, the lower the standard that must inevitably 
be set in all of these schools. In other words, the inva- 
sion of these larger groups into the American high schools 
and colleges is lowering the standards in these institu- 
tions and is actually making them poorer places than 
ever before for the education of the best minds. The 
high schools and colleges are probably not so stimulat- 
ing, and the standards set not so high as they were

twenty-five or fifty years ago.12. They are not so well 
suited for the training of leadership as they once were. 
The American University professors are, indeed, com- 
plaining of the deterioration in the quality of their 
graduate students. 
Were we faced with the need of choosing between the 
education of a selected group and the neglect of the 
masses, or the education of larger groups as is at present 
the case, we should unhesitatingly choose the latter al- 
ternative. Undoubtedly it would be to the advantage of 
the community, if such choice were inevitable, to elevate 
the general standard of the largest possible percentage of 
the population, rather than develop a few to their utmost 
capacity and neglect the rest. But no such course is 
forced upon us. We are now pursuing one of these alter- 
natives to the neglect of the most highly endowed, but 
there is no need for it. Differentiated education, develop- 
ing each group, would be just to all, sacrificing none and 
utilizing for society as a whole all of its latent resources 
of intelligence. Under such a system each group could 
be held to its own maximum potentiality, and the lower 
levels of intelligence would not, as they do to-day, ac- 
tually bar the way to education of the most highly en- 
dowed. This last statement is not fanciful. Jt is a 
simple fact that for the small percentage of most highly 
gifted children so far discovered, there are in America 
no school facilities. 
Inadequacy of present adjustments in view of avail- 
able scientific method.—The European school systems

tering High School.” The School Review, Vol. XX. 355,

THE CLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS FOR INSTRUCTION 245 
are selective, but not scientifically so. They train special 
groups selected on the basis of social rank and of wealth. 
These bases are arbitrary and unjust, but they do make 
it possible to train a selected group for leadership—a 
group which is likely to contain many of the most highly 
endowed, as proved by the very importance of their 
position. An undifferentiated, single, democratic school 
fails to give any group special opportunities and is, for 
the most highly endowed group, an inferior educating 
means. We should not employ arbitrary methods of 
selection. We must call in psychology to our assistance. 
Until we do this, efforts at readjustment will be futile. 
The great average will always keep the attainments of 
the school system mediocre. 
In response to this evident fact that group standards 
make for lowered and inadequate demands upon the most 
highly endowed, another means of adjustment is sug- 
gested in the form of the so-called achievement quotient. 
In place of the norm based on the median attainment of 
the group as a whole, the suggestion is made that we 
demand of each child results in the standard units of 
achievement in terms of his capacity, representing his 
achievement not merely in score attained, but in score 
attained in relation to intelligence. An identical attain- 
ment in spelling ability, for example, might be satisfac- 
tory for the child of median intelligence, very good for the 
child of less than median intelligence, and poor for the 
child of better than median intelligence. But the adjust- 
ment is, once more, in merely quantitative terms. “The 
pupils of great natural ability are required to do enough 
more than the average to keep their A.Q.’s near 1... . 
The pupils of little natural “ability are not rebuked or
-P-A-G-E-262
  246 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
scorned for failures in gross achievement. They, too, are 
required simply to maintain their A.Q.’s near 1.” 18 
Much easier and more direct would be norms for groups, 
and in terms of qualitatively differentiated goals. Our 
present standards of achievement are not usable. Until 
we have a real reclassification and a reorganization allow- 
ing for new ideals in accomplishment, scope rather than 
mere rate of progress, we shall never know what modern 
public education is capable of. We have before us a 
new era, and past attainments are no index of what 
the future holds for American schools. The time has 
come when every school must examine every child who 
presents himself for admission and determine his intelli- 
gence status. It seems remarkable that in view of the 
availability of modern scientific methods for cataloguing 
and making a mental inventory of the incoming classes, 
schools are still so slow in availing themselves of this 
instrument. It seems difficult to understand why, with 
this possibility at hand, schools still go on using the 
established method of admitting all children at age six, 
trying them out, and determining their ability after years 
of experimenting; for they are really not in a position, 
on the basis of school aptitude alone, until after two or 
three years of trial to make any statement of the child’s 
ability. 
Every school should make a mental inventory of all 
entering children. No school which is not prepared to 
give mental tests to all the children entering it ought any 
longer to be given a clean bill of health by any group of 
surveyors.‘ Terman says that “in an average city, ap-

proximately a fourth of the pupils fail of promotion at 
the end of the first year.” 1° This is probably an under- 
statement rather than an exaggeration. The numerous 
retardation studies made would rather tend to indicate 
that the group repeating the first grade is one-third. In 
the United States, there are many more than one million 
children constantly in the first grade. Using the Terman 
fraction, this means that every year some 250,000 chil- 
dren are being given first-grade instruction, regarding 
whom an intelligence examination would indicate that 
they have not yet attained a mental age enabling them to 
do first-grade work. Allowing fifty children to a teacher, 
this means a waste of effort and salary of 5000 elementary- 
school teachers in the United States every year. 
The salaries represented by these 5000 teachers of 
children who have not yet arrived at the capacity to do 
first-grade work would undoubtedly pay for the expense 
of a psychological examination, provide for playground 
care for these children, and leave a large sum available 
for special opportunities for gifted children—all without 
the need of asking additional funds from the taxpayers. 
In view of the existence of this scientific information, 
schools should use the available funds in a more eco- 
nomical manner. In any competitive industry in which 
the most alert avail themselves of all scientific informa- 
tion at hand, one so conservatively adhering to estab- 
lished methods as the schools which to-day act on the 
basis of attained chronological instead of mental age,

end of a half-hour examination is not found out by the 
schools until two or three years have elapsed and large 
sums of money have been wasted, seems no longer 
warranted. 
The basic difficulty here is practice, based on tradition 
and not on theory, but rigidly frozen in statutory com- 
pulsory provisions that all children must be sent to school 
when the age arrives, be it six, or seven or eight, and 
that all children are required to stay in school a fixed 
number of years. Children differ, but the laws are 
uniform.!® 
Summary 
The method of simultaneous instruction was a notable 
innovation, because it made mass education possible. 
Doubtless it is responsible for the hastening of the period 
of universal compulsory education, such as we have in 
America to-day. Its primary justification is, therefore, 
economic, although we are developing a technic which en- 
deavors to utilize for the child’s best interests the avail- 
able advantages involved in group instruction. 
But simultaneous instruction is not synonymous with 
grade grouping. This system, based on approximate 
chronological age, which involves the organization of edu- 
cational units in terms of years, and holding children to- 
gether for approximately the same number of years, is 
only one possible method of grouping children for pur- 
poses of simultaneous instruction. 
As a matter of fact this basis of grouping has become 
exceedingly arbitrary and unreliable, in view of our ac- 
**The curriculum problem raised by the reclassification here sug- 
gested is dealt with in Chapter XIV. 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
THE CLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS FOR INSTRUCTION 249 
cumulating knowledge regarding variation both in the 
rate of development and in ultimate potentiality. Mental 
age, physiological age, and conceivably emotional age 
and maturity age, all tend to group children with greater 
accuracy than the fact of chronological age. This 
is proved by the fact that of the children who enter 
the first grade in the United States, from a fourth to a 
third ordinarily fail of promotion. The index which 
marks them for admission, chronological age, is defective 
in one case out of three or four, even if we leave out of 
consideration those children who might have entered at 
an earlier age. Attempts to mitigate the evils of the sys- 
tem by various devices have failed. We need new prin- 
ciples of classification, new bases for homogeneity, that 
will be more effective than chronological age in group- 
ing children of a similarly educable type. 
Conceivably, we shall ultimately develop a schoolable 
age, composed of mental, maturity, emotional, physiologi- 
cal, and all other contributing factors. For the present, 
we may avail ourselves of the single well-established fac- 
tor, intelligence status. But mere grouping for purposes 
of pursuing the same course at varying rates of progress 
will not do. It fails to tap all the resources of intelligence 
available. We must come to completely differentiated 
education, setting up varying goals for varying groups in 
qualitative, not merely quantitative, terms. 
Problems 
Numerous problems in school procedure arise out of 
the discussion of this chapter. Reserving for another 
chapter the matter of curriculum suitable for varying 
types of children as well as the exact determination of a

practical grouping for purposes of instruction, which may 
best be discussed along with the content of the courses, 
we may present here two of the questions. 
1. Establish a set of bases, or outline procedure for 
the preparation of a set of bases, that shall serve as 
criteria for determining the admissibility of a child to 
school, for the beginning of formal education. The 
criteria referred to are other than those of mental age, 
which will, of course, be important. The establishment 
of the point of transition from home to school will involve 
a consideration of the home as an educative pre-school 
agency, the period of its maximum efficiency and the 
point at which it begins to wane; it will also involve an 
enumeration of the qualities essential for successful work 
under public-school conditions. When from one-third 
to one-fourth of the children who enter the first grade 
fail, wasting the efforts of thousands of teachers paid for 
by hundreds of thousands of dollars, it must be clear 
that the present method of admission is inefficient and 
that the problem is important. 
2. Prepare a set of recommendations for improved 
compulsory education legislation. If children vary in 
ultimate potentiality, then the time of leaving school 
should probably be as variable as the time of entering.

CHAPTER XI 
TEACHER ASSIGNMENT—ORGANIZING THE STAFF FOR 
PURPOSES OF INSTRUCTION 
Current practice—We dealt, in the last chapter, with 
the question of organizing pupils for purposes of instruc- 
tion from the point of view of homogeneity—organizing 
them in such a way that they might constitute groups 
that could be effectively taught together. We found a 
standard, traditional practice whose basic soundness we 
questioned. Regardless of the basis, however, as soon as 
we have grouped our children for instructional purposes, 
we face two questions: what to teach and how to make 
the best use of the teaching staff at our disposal. The 
former of these questions will be discussed in the three 
chapters which follow; the latter will engage our atten- 
tion in this chapter. 
In this matter of teacher assignment, as in pupil classi- 
fication, we find an established practice. It, too, has its 
roots in the theory of grading and classification on the 
basis of approximate similarity of chronological age. The 
children enter school at approximately six, they are turned 
over to a teacher or teachers in the traditional numbers, 
and at the end of the year or of the half-year, if we are 
in a school sufficiently large to be fully graded, those of 
the children who have been able to do the work are passed 
on to the next teacher, and the first one receives a fresh

group of newcomers. And so it ordinarily goes through 
the grades, throughout the child’s elementary-school 
career. The standard American system of organization, 
certainly below the seventh grade, is to provide one 
teacher for each grade, half-grade, or two grades in the 
smaller schools, and this teacher is ordinarily required 
to give instruction in all subjects of the course of study. 
Perhaps it would be following the old adage too far to 
suspect that she is “master of none”; but that she is an 
equally well trained and enthusiastic teacher of all would 
be a hazardous assumption. Occasionally, when the de- 
fect is very glaring, she arranges to “exchange” with an- 
other teacher—drawing for geography, for example. 
Grade assignment and simultaneous instruction not 
inseparable.—But, granting that simultaneous instruc- 
tion is an established and inevitable fact, this particular 
type of organization is not the only one possible. Grade 
teaching and simultaneous instruction are not synony- 
mous terms, any more than simultaneous instruction and 
pupil classification by grade are synonymous terms. We 
can have the advantages of class instruction without the 
grade system as well as with it, so that if the latter has 
disadvantages, we may consider remedies. 
The advantage of class or simultaneous instruction is 
primarily the financial one involved in the fact that one 
teacher shall be responsible at any given time for the care 
of a certain number—as yet scientifically undetermined— 
of children. So long as this demand is complied with and 
the children make the expected progress, we have simul- 
taneous instruction, regardless of the basis of the organi- 
zation. Many different bases are conceivable. The most 
efficient should be employed. Usage and experience,

while of importance, cannot be allowed as sole justifica- 
tion for school practice. 
The “individual” system.—In the elementary school of 
the San Francisco State Teachers’ College and in the 
city schools of Winnetka, Illinois, for example, simul- 
taneous instruction is carried on by assigning to each 
teacher a number of children of approximately the same 
age, who, however, are not expected to proceed at the 
same rate, or perhaps, to do the same kind of work. The 
teacher does not give a great deal of oral instruction to 
the group as a whole. They need, therefore, not keep 
pace in their arithmetic or spelling or history. The work 
is organized in units for accomplishment outlined in bulle- 
tins, which the children are directed to follow. The 
teacher deals with each individual as circumstances de- 
mand. This is not typically grade instruction. The 
teacher is not a grade teacher. Classification on the basis 
of approximate ability and age is as much due to social 
reasons as to any need from the. teaching point of view. 
A good teacher under this system might as easily deal 
with children along all stages of the educational route. 
Yet the requirements of simultaneous instruction are 
met; we have one teacher to a number of children. 
This system, which has not received the consideration 
and experiment which it deserves, is referred to here 
primarily for the purpose of illustrating this fact that 
rigid grouping by grade is not an essential feature of 
group instruction.1_ Two possible modifications of pres- 
ent practice are to be dealt with in this chapter in some

grade instruction, see H. Parkhurst, Education on the Dalton Plan (E. 
P. Dutton, 1922), and A. H. Sutherland, Intelligence Tests and School

detail, i. e., the advancement of the teacher with the 
class, and departmentalization. 
Advancement of the Teacher with the Class 
American and foreign plans contrasted—Should the 
teacher, at the end of the year or the half-year, when 
most of her pupils are promoted, continue on with her 
class, and if so, for how long a time? Would it make 
for an improvement of the teacher? Would it be of value 
to the pupils? Would it improve school practice? Would 
it have notable disadvantages that would make it im- 
practicable? This system has been tried abroad, and 
speaking generally, it is true that more European schools 
follow it in whole or in part than do not.1* An extreme 
application of the plan may be found in Copenhagen and 
other cities of Denmark, where the same teacher remains 
with his class throughout the seven years of the elemen- 
tary school. The school authorities at Brussels report 
an equally interesting, if more cautious application. The 
young teacher is assigned to an entering class which he 
holds for two years, and if very capable, for four years. 
Most teachers return to an entering class at the end of 
two years, and then take their second group through four 
years. When they have traveled this route twice, after 
eight or ten years of service, they leave it entirely and 
begin to work in the two upper years which precede de- 
partmentalization. In this way the child may have the 
same teacher for two, three, four, five, or six years, but 
never for only one. 
In America we do not, on the whole, follow the system 
* France is a notable exception, the practice there conforming to the 
American system.
-P-A-G-E-272
  256 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
of advancing the teacher with the class. The practice is 
in effect in a few centers and there strictly within cycles 
or circuits which rarely if ever exceed two years. “The 
result is that a teacher, once assigned to a grade (or, as 
often happens, to a half-grade), whether originally from 
the standpoint of efficiency or not, remains commonly 
fixed in that grade, on the ground that she knows the 
work better than any other work, and can therefore do it 
better. . . . It is certainly an open question whether the 
doctrine of efficiency through specialization has not re- 
ceived too narrow an interpretation on the false assump- 
tion of analogy between retention of teachers in grade 
in the public schools and the subdivision of labor in fac- 
tories, with its restriction of process and uniform repe- 
tition of limited movement.” ? 
But the very existence of any kind of efficiency at all 
under this arrangement is questioned: “Many weeks are 
consumed before the average teacher can sense the pecu- 
liarities and needs of even a majority of her pupils, can 
establish the sympathetic and confidential relationships 
so necessary to grade teaching. Likewise, there must be 
a considerable lapse of time before the children can 
understand the teacher’s attitude and intent. After these 
adjustments are made, an able teacher can make prog- 
ress in her work in spite of her manifold duties. But, 
unbelievable as it may sound, no sooner are such good 
working conditions established than the fortunate, or 
shall we say unfortunate, among the children are pro- 
moted to another room and another teacher to make new 
readjustments.” *

Advantages and disadvantages.—In favor of promot- 
ing the teacher with the class, to summarize the argu- 
ments briefly, it is contended that it would be better for 
teachers and children to allow for intimate acquaintance; 
it would stimulate teachers and keep them from getting 
into a rut. Greater joy in work; greater unification of 
the pupil’s work than is possible under the system of so 
many breaks; the fact that no time is lost in becoming 
acquainted with the group; the fact that the teacher 
knows what has gone before; that she dare not neglect 
any part of the work because she will be held ultimately 
responsible; that the arrangement tends to keep the 
teacher personally and professionally alive by lengthen- 
ing the interval between repetition of work and the pleas- 
ure and consequent improvement and enthusiasm in- 
volved in seeing the children develop, a thing that is not 
possible where she passes a group through every five 
months—all of these claims are made for the proposal. 
The objections that are made are numerous and im- 
portant. Many teachers in America are either new or 
poorly trained and need to stay a long time in one grade 
to learn the routine, the subject-matter, and the best 
methods. Many teachers, adapted to pupils of a particu- 
lar age, would fail with pupils of another age. Many 
teachers prefer the lesser labors involved in continuing 
in the one grade, and enjoy the constant change of chil- 
dren. They would lose enthusiasm in dealing with the 
same group. There would be an unfair distribution of 
teacher ability, some children having the poorer teacher 
for several terms or years. Children enjoy the change of 
teacher involved in the present system, and are protected 
against becoming dependent on the viewpoint of one per-

    258 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
son. We have too great a turnover of teachers and even 
of pupils, making for a lack of the stability which is 
implied in the advantages of this system. 
Departmentalization 
The case for departmentalization——Final statement 
of opinion in this matter should await a discussion of the 
second modification of present practice to be discussed, 
namely, the proposal that the upper grades of the six- 
year school be departmentalized, providing teachers on 
the subject rather than the group basis; teachers of 
geography, history, or music, for the children of all the 
grades involved, instead of all-subject teachers. No ad- 
ditional personnel is demanded. Using the number of 
teachers ordinarily assigned on the basis of enrolment, 
allowing the usual number of children per teacher, de- 
partmentalization proposes a different mode of assigning 
teachers. 
The recommendation of promoting the teacher with the 
grade implied the demand that she master the complete 
content of several years of work. But the challenge is 
offered that she is not even capable of mastering all the 
work of any single grade. “The prevailing custom in the 
primary and intermediate grades of American schools,” 
says one superintendent, “is to give each teacher almost 
entire charge of from thirty to forty-five children of a 
certain grade and to continue them under such tutelage 
for a period of either four and a half or nine months. At 
the expiration of such a period, all of these children except 
the failures are placed in charge of another teacher, when 
the same procedure is repeated. This plan works fairly 
well in the primary grades where the children are tract-
-P-A-G-E-275
ORGANIZING THE STAFF FOR INSTRUCTION 259 
able and the course of study consists, in a broad sense, 
of only one or two main subjects, although a much better 
plan could be devised. When, however, the intermediate 
grades are reached, we find that a teacher has to instruct 
the children not only in drawing, music, spelling, writing, 
reading, and arithmetic, as in the primary grades, but 
also in hygiene, language, history, geography, manual 
work, nature-study, scientific temperance, dictionary 
study; we find that she has often two divisions in many 
of the foregoing subjects, is expected to teach the children 
how to study, supervise their study periods, make daily 
assignments for each subject, conduct opening exercises, 
correct papers, keep detailed record and plan books, fill 
out numerous reports, keep in touch with the home, su- 
pervise recess periods, attend teachers’ meetings, and per- 
form other duties assigned her.” ¢ 
Surely we have here a problem that demands con- 
sideration. Is it possible efficiently to do the work out- 
lined, even assuming the excellence of preceding train- 
ing? Is it possible to do this work on the basis of the 
rather meager training of the average American elemen- 
tary-school teacher? Can we expect efficient teaching? 
Is it any surprise that the text writers of American school 
books are undertaking the teaching of the children and 
turning the American teachers into lesson hearers? What 
is to be done? In the seventh and eighth grades, the 
situation is evidently being met in an increasing number 
of schools either by the development of the junior high 
school, or the departmentalization of these grades. The 
possibility and desirability of departmentalization for 
the upper grades seems to be conceded. Can the same be 
‘Ibid, p. 101. 
   
-P-A-G-E-276
260 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
done for the lower grades? If so, how far down can de- 
partmentalization be made effective? What are its ad- 
vantages and its disadvantages? 
Advantages claimed.—The advantages claimed for de- 
partmentalization by those who have tried it, are exactly 
the same for these grades as for the seventh and eighth 
grades or the high school; namely, that it vitalizes teach- 
ing by restricting the field, by giving teachers subjects 
that they like, by enabling them to do more study and 
making them more enthusiastic. In a word, it is 
a more efficient use of the teaching personnel, and 
militates against that mediocrity which must come with 
numerous subjects, and the monotony that must be the 
result of teaching the same grade for a number of years. 
This system involves the reclassification of teachers on 
the basis of subject rather than on the basis of grade, a 
reclassification with which it seems difficult to see how 
any one could quarrel. It is to be noted that the work 
of the first two or possibly three years of work would 
probably in itself be regarded as one “field” or subject 
of instruction, and that the differentiation on the basis 
of curriculum content would begin possibly with the third 
and certainly with the fourth grade. Teachers who are 
endowed with a peculiar capacity for the early training 
of childhood would elect to have full charge of children 
for two or three years. Others would be required to de- 
velop an interest in the content and method of one sub- 
ject of elementary-school instruction, or of the group 
known as the “fundamental” subjects. 
The writer is not aware of any serious objection to the 
departmentalizing of grades below the seventh on educa- 
tional grounds. Argument against it on administrative 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
    ORGANIZING THE STAFF FOR INSTRUCTION 261 
grounds ought not to receive serious consideration. 
What is educationally desirable ought to be made admin- 
istratively possible. That it can be so made is demon- 
strated by principals who report successful departmental- 
ization of the grades under discussion. 
Current alternatives to departmentalization unsatis- 
factory.—That the present teaching personnel is not so 
well rounded in capacity as to be able to meet success- 
fully all the requirements of the modern elementary- 
school curriculum is so patent and universally known as 
to make discussion a waste of space and time. Rough 
compensations are now being made by the method of ex- 
changing, whereby teachers specially capable in certain 
subjects, such as music and drawing, teach these courses 
to classes other than their own in exchange for work done 
by teachers of those grades. Another means of meeting 
this situation is by the use of supervisors of special sub- 
jects who endeavor to make up the deficiencies of new 
and poorly trained teachers by special work, and to keep 
up the standards by various means and methods of su- 
pervision, a device whose temporary and unsatisfactory 
character the supervisors will be the first to admit. Still 
another method of handling this situation is contributed 
by those normal schools which have ceased pretending 
that they can in two years turn out fully prepared eight- 
grade teachers, and require their students to specialize 
in certain sections of the elementary school.> How much 
more desirable it would be to specialize in subjects rather 
than in grades will be indicated later.

  262 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Organizing the departmentalized school.—The ad- 
ministrative machinery for operating departmentalization 
in a six-grade school has probably not yet been standard- 
ized. One superintendent * presents an interesting sys- 
tem whereby the teaching group is divided into two 
halves. In this system each child spends one-half his 
time with one teacher who gives instruction in the so- 
called fundamentals, and is regarded as that child’s home 
teacher, having many of the associations which go with 
the so-called class or room teacher. The other half-day 
he spends with several special-subject teachers. Two 
combinations are possible: The teacher herself may be 
for one-half the time a room teacher, and for the other 
half a teacher of one special subject, or one group of 
teachers may conduct home rooms in the two or three / 
fundamental subjects for two groups of children, while 
the other group spend the entire day as subject teachers. 
In Berkeley, California, A. J. Hamilton, principal of 
the Washington School, has developed an admirable or- 
ganization for departmentalizing the upper four grades 
of his six-grade elementary school. His administrative 
unit for this purpose consists of ten groups of children, 
ten teachers, ten subjects of instruction, and a day divided 
into ten periods. His teaching corps is divided into two 
groups, five of them teaching special subjects, and the 
others being teachers of the fundamental subjects—one- 
half the total number of subjects taught, namely, arith- 
metic, penmanship, reading, spelling, and language. 
These latter are the classroom teachers, with occasional 
exceptions—each teacher meeting two groups for half 
*D. DuShane in “The Intermediate Grades and Departmentaliza- 
tion.” Elementary School Journal, Vol. XVII, p. 102.
-P-A-G-E-279
  ORGANIZING THE STAFF FOR INSTRUCTION 263 
the school time of each group. These periods are not 
consecutive. In other words, the day is not divided into 
halves, one-half for each section. The teacher alternates 
throughout the day between her sections, giving the chil- 
dren the opportunity of varying the program. 
The five special-subject teachers confine themselves 
respectively to music, drawing, history, geography, and 
physical education, each one teaching her specialty 
throughout the school. The reader may readily work out 
the details of this program. The day has a total of 100 
periods of instruction to be provided for. Fifty periods 
are taken by five teachers of the fundamentals, and fifty 
by five teachers of special subjects, each teacher being 
occupied during the entire ten-period day. There are 
some modifications which need not be gone into here, in- 
volved in the facts that not all grades take all of the 
special subjects, and not every special subject is taught 
daily. This leaves room for subjects taught by general 
city teachers who do not form part of the local organiza- 
tion, as, for example, teachers of home economics and 
manual training. The adjustment is made by setting 
special-subject teachers free during part of the time for 
other purposes. The fundamental subjects receive their 
full five periods daily. 
The first two years of work rightly form a definite 
specialty. Whether the teachers of the fundamentals 
should advance with their groups and, if they should, 
for how long a period, is an important question. In the 
Washington School they remain with them for a circuit 
of four years. 
Immediate advantages.—Some of the obvious advan- 
tages which result from departmentalization may be
-P-A-G-E-280
  264 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
briefly noted. As regards the teacher, she is relieved 
from the drudgery of teaching subjects in which she can- 
not develop an interest and, conversely, secures an op- 
portunity to develop along the lines of her special interest. 
She is relieved of many of the meetings with supervisors 
of special subjects, her preparation is limited to one field, 
she can provide for the gradual development and grada- 
tion of her work, can lay plans some years ahead. Other 
phases, partly in the nature of social advantages, will be 
noted later. 
So far as the child is concerned, the system provides 
better teaching; a more even distribution of the advan- 
tages and disadvantages of good and bad teaching, since 
he comes in contact with the entire personnel, the physi- 
cal advantages of moving from room to room, and the 
variety that comes with different teachers, both of which 
operate to minimize the factor of fatigue. 
There are many advantages of a general kind, such, 
for example, as the opportunity to establish special rooms 
for music, geography, art, and the other subjects, and to 
carry on extensive projects going beyond the term and 
even beyond the year. 
Can any question be asked so far as the children are 
concerned regarding the improvement and desirability 
of this method of specialization? Can it be doubted that 
a teacher definitely interested in one subject and freed 
from the need of keeping in mediocre contact with many, 
will be able to let go her grip on the text-book and be- 
come enthusiastic, interested, and creative? It would 
seem difficult to doubt that the work will become more 
vivid and more vital in the hands of a teacher giving 
instruction in her chosen field. Normal-school training,
-P-A-G-E-281
ORGANIZING THE STAFF FOR INSTRUCTION 265 
with these points in view, will have an opportunity to 
turn out specialists by making better use of the time 
available, and the result will be a much finer teaching 
personnel even without increasing the length of time 
now required for preparation. Departmentalization would 
seem to present an opportunity to the American schools 
for greatly improving the quality of instruction without 
increasing the expense thereof, merely by a reorganiza- 
tion and a more intelligent use of the teaching personnel. 
Departmentalization and Teacher Advancement 
in Combination 
We may now return to the question of the desirability 
of advancement of the teacher with her class. It is 
claimed that this method has many advantages for both 
children and teacher; operating in the case of the teacher 
to prevent her from becoming less alert, less interested, 
and dulled by the monotony involved in the annual or 
semiannual repetition of the same work. It tends to keep 
her fresh and it aids the children by their being under 
the influence of one teacher who is acquainted with them. 
So far as the teacher is concerned, one would think that 
the advantages are rather obvious in spite of the fact 
that the unprofessional and uninterested teacher would 
object to the need for work and preparation involved in 
the method. Against the system it is objected that there 
are numerous administrative difficulties, such as graded 
salary scales and frequency of change of teachers inherent 
in our American system, and particularly the fact that 
those children who come under inexperienced and incom- 
petent teachers would be at a great disadvantage in con- 
tinuing with those teachers for very long periods. 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  266 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Does it not seem that a proposal to departmentalize 
three or four of the upper grades of the six-grade ele- 
mentary school preserves all the advantages and elimi- 
nates many of the disadvantages of the method of keeping 
a teacher with one group of children for a comparatively 
long period of time? In view of the fact that the teacher 
is given a fairly wide choice and can therefore select some- 
thing most suitable to her preparation and taste, it ought 
to be decidedly possible to decrease incompetence, as 
many of the poor teachers under such a system would 
automatically become more competent. At the same 
time teacher and pupil would be given opportunity to 
develop curriculum units continuously without those gaps 
and jars that come with the change of teachers and with 
the fact that these teachers are always of uneven capacity 
over the curriculum range. 
Ultimate social and general Educational values.—In 
addition to the advantages already noted—that the work 
would ordinarily be better done; that the training schools 
would have an opportunity to prepare their students more 
efficiently; that by being permitted to make their choice 
of subjects, a larger number of teachers would become 
competent in some one field and the incompetents would 
be more easily detected and weeded out; that natural en- 
thusiasm for one’s field would enable teachers to become 
creative, and to exercise initiative—certain other im- 
portant advantages that would follow departmentaliza- 
tion should be noted: 
Departmentalization would help most effectively to 
break down the unnatural and unhealthy barriers now 
existing between the various types of American schools. 
As was noted in a preceding chapter, we in America have
-P-A-G-E-283
  
ORGANIZING THE STAFF FOR INSTRUCTION 267 
two distinct methods of teacher-preparation, and no 
method of advancing from one school to another. Ordi- 
narily the elementary-school teacher entering the grade 
work finds it almost impossible ever to look forward to 
the high school, which implies special training in a single 
field of knowledge. It is entirely conceivable that be- 
ginning with the development of a single subject of in- 
terest in the normal school, a certain proportion of teach- 
ers having real professional ambitions and interests will 
find it possible by further study to develop proficiency 
along their line of aptitude, and to go on from school to 
school, through the junior high school to the senior high 
school and further still. 
It has already been noted that one of the most deaden- 
ing and unwholesome facts in American education is the 
impossibility of making a professional career in this field. 
The hindrance involved by the method of local units, 
signifying a new job and a new employer with every 
change of post, has been noted. The impossibility of 
looking forward ever to leaving the narrow confines of 
the elementary school, which faces the entire teaching 
body with so few exceptions that they are not worth no- 
ticing, is another of these hindrances. The removal of 
every barrier that stands in the way of forward and up- 
ward movement of the teaching body is of great value. 
Not the least, therefore, of the claims to be made in favor 
of departmentalization is the fact that it may stimulate 
the development of special interests which may lead to 
advancement from school to school and therefore vitalize 
the work. 
The present conduct of the inherited institution of the 
teachers’ institute has been charged with being void of 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
268 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
fruitfulness, consisting as it does either of so-called in- 
spirational addresses, or “intensive” work of three or four 
lectures on some aspect of elementary-school procedure. 
It does not seem beyond the possibility of realization 
that under a system of departmentalization, teachers’ 
meetings composed of specialists within a given field may 
become vitally significant and practical media for the 
democratic interchange of ideas that will replace the 
gatherings where the teaching force are sometimes merely 
“talked at.” 
Summary 
The prevalent American method of assigning teachers 
to classes is based, traditionally, on the same set of facts 
as the classification of the children themselves. Teachers 
are ordinarily assigned to grades, and are expected to 
teach all of the subjects required by the course of study 
for their particular grades. But assignment on the basis 
of grade and simultaneous instruction are not inseparable. 
We can have class instruction without following the sys- 
tem of grade assignment. Whenever we have one teacher 
responsible for the instruction of a group of children we 
have simultaneous instruction. But there are various 
methods conceivable for constituting the group. 
The “individual system” in use at the San Francisco 
State Teachers’ College and elsewhere is a case in point. 
Here we have one teacher responsible for a group of chil- 
dren. But the children are grouped for social reasons, 
from the point of view of maturity. It happens that 
they are also of approximately the same status educa- 
tionally, but that is a secondary matter. Each pupil pro-
-P-A-G-E-285
  
ORGANIZING THE STAFF FOR INSTRUCTION 269 
gresses at his own rate and the teacher deals with each 
in turn individually. 
In this chapter we deal with two suggested modifica- 
tions of present practice, namely, the advancement of 
the teacher with her grade and departmentalization. The 
first of these modifications may be adopted alone. But » 
departmentalization, in effect, produces the beneficial 
results claimed for both. 
Advancement of the teacher with the class, which is 
extensively practised on the European continent, where 
there are instances of the same teacher remaining with 
a group of children throughout their elementary-school 
course, is in very little use in the United States. In some 
cities in America teachers are rotated within a cycle that 
commonly lasts two and practically never exceeds three 
years. Many advantages are claimed for this plan, but 
its adoption in America has not been gaining ground. It 
is claimed that there are many obstacles to its establish- 
ment, not to mention the fact that it is opposed in theory 
by some educational thinkers. 
Departmentalization, by which is meant assignment 
of teachers on the basis of subject instead of on the basis 
of grade, so that each teacher teaches one subject to a 
number of classes, has been universally approved for the 
seventh and eighth grades and is now the uniform prac- 
tice in junior high schools which have taken over these 
grades. The proposal is now made that the six-year ele- 
mentary schools departmentalize the work of the upper 
four grades, regarding the work of the first two years as 
in itself a specialty. That it can be done, is demonstrated 
by enthusiastic reports from administrators who have 
tried it. The objection that the child requires some one 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  270 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
teacher to rely on for many reasons and purposes, is met 
by leaving him in the care of one teacher for approxi- 
mately half the time to be instructed in the “funda- 
mental” subjects, while departmentalization is applied 
during the other half of the day to the “special” subjects. 
For the child, the advantages enumerated are the fact 
that the teaching, being done by specialists, is naturally 
more efficient; that the poor and good teaching is evenly 
distributed, so that no child suffers unduly from the 
poorer teachers; that there is a continuous process for 
each subject in place of the gaps; that it is possible to 
establish special-subject rooms with consequent ad- 
vantages; that he comes in contact with a number of 
personalities daily instead of with just one; and that the 
variety makes for interest, and the getting about the 
building to the various rooms operates against fatigue. 
For the teacher, the advantages enumerated are that 
she is relieved of work which she does not like or for 
which she is poorly prepared; that she has the oppor- 
tunity to devote herself enthusiastically to one field in 
which she may be interested and in that way improve her 
teaching; and that it economizes time and effort in prep- 
aration, since the same reading and study may serve as 
preparation for a number of groups. 
There are some advantages of a general social charac- 
ter, making for the improvement of education as a whole, 
which are important: In the first place, the normal 
schools, relieved of the necessity to prepare teachers in 
content and method for all of the eight grades, would be 
enabled to make better use of the available time to pre- 
pare special-subject teachers. In the second place, the 
development of interest in special fields of knowledge
-P-A-G-E-287
  ORGANIZING THE STAFF FOR INSTRUCTION 271 
and restriction of work to these fields would do away with 
a great deal of the supervision and special instruction 
now going on at teachers’ meetings, and would place the 
teachers themselves in a position to do constructive edu- 
cational thinking in their respective fields. 
Finally, the definite development of special interests 
would set a certain proportion of the teachers on the,road 
to higher study and advancement from the elementary 
school to the two or even three other links in the Amer- 
ican educational system. This would help to break down 
the present barriers which almost entirely bar the 
progress of elementary-school teachers, which are a 
deterrent to ambition and tend to create an undesirable 
hierarchy of teacher groups. 
Problems 
1, Canvass a group of representative teachers, ad- 
ministrators, and teacher-training school officers who op- 
pose the departmentalization of the six-grade school, list 
the causes for their opposition, and, in view of these state- 
ments, prepare a memorandum of opinion regarding the 
practicability and desirability of the proposal. 
2. It would be impossible to make an immediate 
change effectively in any school system, since the de- 
velopment of special interests in the teaching staff is 
requisite. Prepare a plan for the gradual introduction 
of the departmental idea. 
8. The daily program for a departmentalized six- 
grade school is an important but as yet unsettled matter. 
On the basis of the two schools described in the bibliog- 
raphy and the Berkeley program referred to in the text, 
prepare a program of your own.

  CHAPTER XII 
THE CURRICULUM AS A GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM 
An unsettled question.—Asked to name the one prob- 
lem of outstanding importance in a school, the average 
person would point to the curriculum or course of study. 
After all, it is the activity carried on in the school to 
which every other element is subordinate. Plant, equip- 
ment, books and other material of instruction, teaching 
personnel—all converge toward the central point of 
study. 
How interesting then to note that the elementary- 
school curriculum is probably the one feature with which 
school people are to-day least satisfied, and which is be- 
ing attacked most freely. “The present program of pub- 
lic education,” says Professor Bobbitt,! “was mainly for- 
mulated during the simpler conditions of the nineteenth 
century. .. . A program never designed for the present 
day has been inherited.” Another thinker,? more drastic 
in his criticism, announces that “the traditional curricu- 
lum may be characterized as: 
“Aimless; it does not function in the lives of pupils. 
“Lifeless; mere form subjects predominate. 
“Disconnected; fourteen school subjects are treated as

unrelated except when arbitrarily and superficially 
correlated as schoolroom arts. 
“Congested; the crowded situation is due to the treat- 
ment of empty details. 
“Wasteful; ‘Progress through the grades’ consists of 
‘marking time’ and ‘busy work.’ 
“Untimely; the traditional curriculum is not apace 
with the vital issues of the day.” 
The reasons.—What are the causes of this dissatisfac- 
tion so generally found with the course of study? Sev- 
eral facts are worth bearing in mind. In the first place, 
education in the sense of public instruction for the masses ~ 
on a generous and professional basis, is an institution of 
exceedingly recent origin, being less than a century old 
in America. In the second place, it seems only natural in 
extending education to the people, that the struggle 
should have centered around the need for developing 
facilities and support rather than around any particular 
philosophy of education. So far as educational aims 
were concerned, it seems that those were already estab- 
lished, particularly in the days when education for the 
masses consisted of the merest rudiments or tools of 
modern life. 
Again, this development of mass education has been 
taking place during a period which is itself a transition 
in the history of humanity. The development of the 
sciences; the establishment of cities; the political revo- 
lutions and the resultant changes in the form of govern- 
ment and of social concepts; the industrial revolution 
and its far-reaching changes in economic and social rela- 
tions; the abolition of many well-established relations
-P-A-G-E-291
  Fe 
CURRICULUM AS A GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM 275 
such as those which inhered in the institution of feudal- 
ism; these changes, as history goes, are so recent as to be 
practically contemporary. 
The very fundamental motives underlying mass educa- 
tion have been changing within the period of its institu- 
tion. Beginning as we did with the purely religious 
motive, followed by the political motive inherent in 
democratic government under universal franchise, the 
motive of the moment must take into account the in- 
creasing complexity of modern life, requiring as it does 
many skills, abilities, and capacity to adjust, all of which 
implies ever increasing equipment, and an ever longer 
period of training. 
Public education has gone through an evolution com- 
paratively easy to trace. Beginning as a luxury reserved 
for those of high station it became through the accident 
of the point of view of the Reformation a religious need 
to be supplied by the state or church or some philan- 
thropic agency. With the development of political de- 
mocracy, it has become a definite secular function based 
on political motives; and finally in America it has be- 
come an institution of which every one is required to avail 
himself by compulsion of law to an ever increasing age, 
and almost everywhere beyond age twelve. 
How very new is the social concept of the rightness of 
equality of educational opportunity at the common cost 
of the social group, is easily realized by the American who 
sees the struggle for its establishment going on this very 
day. Archaic though it may seem in the American de- 
mocracy, one may still hear the outraged English tax- 
payer demand to know why he “should be expected to 
contribute anything to the education of any one else’s
-P-A-G-E-292
eer ee oo tae 
276 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
son” after he had “paid a large sum for the education of 
his own.” ® 
It is true, then, that the course of study under which 
the schools are operating to-day is the result in part, of 
the operation of tradition. Like so much else of school 
practice, it has never been consciously formulated on the 
basis of rigid scientific thinking. Coming into being as 
it has without any theory, it is merely a tradition. Gen- 
_ erally speaking, it may be said that the process has here- 
tofore never been gone through of analyzing what it is 
that should be expected of the common school as a con- 
scious social agency for the training of youth. To quote 
Professor Meriam again: “The traditional curriculum is 
a growth, not a construction; a product of social and in- 
dustrial activities rather than an instrument in the im- 
provement of such activities. We are, therefore, unable 
to look for ideas, principles, or policies that control in 
the selection and organization of this curriculum.” ¢ 
There have been notable thinkers, theorists, and re- 
formers in the field of the common school whose contribu- 
tions are vitally effective and influential to this day. Men 
of the stamp of Pestalozzi, Froebel, and Herbart have 
made public education their eternal debtor. Their in- 
fluence, however, their experiments, their thinking, and 
their writing have been primarily concerned, so far as 
any permanent results are involved, with method, man- 
agement, and teaching technic. There has always been 
an underlying assumption in their work of the sufficiency 
of the existing material of the school as an educating

agency, if only the technic of imparting this material 
could be improved. 
It is possible to secure a very fair view of the state 
of mind of these educational reformers, when one realizes 
that to-day a prospective teacher would rarely if ever be 
asked his theories of the curriculum. It is not expected 
that he should have any. The important question is 
whether he is competent to teach—the material to be 
taught being always taken for granted. The average 
person without previous professional training who is pre- 
paring himself to teach, rarely troubles himself to ask 
what it is that he ought to teach. The eternal efficacy 
of the traditional curriculum to achieve the unformulated 
goal of public education seems to be taken for granted 
with a security that is beyond question. All that the 
prospective teacher seems to need is a mastery of this 
material. This unquestioned faith in the mere process 
of learning and the mere end of knowledge is of long 
standing, each person apparently believing in it as a 
means of achieving the thing which to him seems 
good. 
Booker T. Washington, in his autobiography, “Up 
From Slavery,” reports that during the period immedi- 
ately following emancipation one of the “two ideas con- 
stantly agitating the minds of the colored people . 
was the craze for Greek and Latin learning. . . . In every 
part of the South during the Reconstruction period, 
schools both day and night were filled to overflowing 
with people of all ages and conditions, some being as far 
along in age as sixty and seventy years. .. . There was 
a feeling that a knowledge, however little, of the Greek 
and Latin languages would make one a very superior hu-
-P-A-G-E-294

man being, something bordering almost on the super- 
natural.” 
“We have aimed,” says Professor Bobbitt in pointing 
out this lack of formulation of the goals of education,® 
“at a vague culture, an ill defined discipline, a nebulous 
harmonious development of the individual, an indefinite 
moral character-building, an unparticularized social 
efficiency, or, often enough, nothing more than escape 
from a life of work.” 
Finally, a partial explanation of this lack of definiteness 
of formulation is the narrowly historic one found within 
the field of educational practice itself. One of the most 
important keys to an understanding of many of the prob- 
lems and conditions of public education to-day is the 
fact that the elementary school was not created to be a 
first school and to prepare for the next step, namely, 
secondary education, as is the case in America to-day. 
Had the elementary school been consciously organized 
for the purpose that it is serving in America to-day, its 
aims and the demands made on its product would neces- 
sarily have been clarified. by pressure from above. The 
secondary school would readily enough have made its 
requirements known. But the elementary school was 
never intended to be a preparatory step in the process of 
education. The development of elementary education is 
really synonymous with the development of mass educa- 
tion—a mass education which definitely excluded the 
most fortunately situated classes, the children of these 
classes being already well provided for by the secondary 
schools and the universities. At the time of the beginning 
of the movement for mass education, it seemed quite 
natural that elementary education should be synonymous 
°F. Bobbitt, The Curriculum, p. 41. (Houghton Mifflin, 1918.)
-P-A-G-E-295
  CURRICULUM AS A GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM 279 
with the merest minimum of knowledge. Following this 
humble origin, the process of changing the curriculum 
has been not one of conscious formulation in terms of the 
objective to be attained, but rather one of extension and 
adaptation. At its best it undertook to give complete 
preparation for life, since there was no next school to 
which to leave certain things that might better have been 
deferred. 
In the centers presided over by the Brethren of the 
Christian schools, reading, writing, arithmetic, and re- 
ligious instruction constituted the course of study. In 
early Massachusetts we find the curriculum consisting of 
reading, writing, arithmetic, English language, and spell- 
ing. Pestalozzi began to develop sense training and 
added subjects such as drawing and writing, geography 
and nature study, gymnastics and singing. So it has 
gone. Time and place and history, but not rigid science, 
have effected changes in the curriculum. 
The problem to-day.—To-day in America the elemen- 
tary school is clearly a first step in the educational proc- 
ess, since, in accordance with the tendency in progressive 
States, the child is not permitted to go to work at the 
time of his dismissal from the six-year elementary school. 
Duplication and overlapping are, therefore, no longer 
necessary on the theory that many of the children will 
not go on to high school. Given normal intelligence and 
adequate law enforcement, they will all do so. How then 
shall we use the available time? What shall we teach? 
What methods shall we use to make the child most 
efficient from every point of view?—his own as well as 
that of the community; his happiness as well as his pro- 
ductivity? 
These questions represent the great responsibility of  
-P-A-G-E-296
  280 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
the teaching profession to-day. To what end or purpose 
will effective school work serve, if we have not set our- 
selves clear goals toward which we are consciously tend- 
ing? The problem can be formulated clearly enough. It 
is simply a question of how we may effect most econom- 
ically from every point of view, including finances as well 
as wear and tear, the best social results, caring at the 
same time for the fullest expansion and share of the best 
in life by the individual; not sacrificing him unnecessarily 
for any conceived general community aims, but on the 
other hand providing for the maximum possible develop- 
ment of each individual within the circle of social well- 
being. 
Whatever may be the right way to achieve this goal, 
one thing is now clear beyond the need of further discus- 
sion: the question of the curriculum is not the simple 
question of subject-matter. The curriculum can no longer 
be confused with the course of study any more than edu- 
cation can to-day be confused with teaching or instruc- 
tion. Just as teaching is rapidly becoming one phase of 
education, so the course of study, consisting of books and 
other materials by means of which the pupil acquires 
knowledge and information, is but part of the group of ac- 
tivities to be known as the curriculum, which in addition 
to knowledge and information must provide activities 
and facilities for the conscious ends of useful habits, at- 
titudes, ideals, motives, and as conscious inhibitions of 
certain non-useful and antisocial tendencies. 
One of the greatest sources of dissatisfaction with the 
curriculum of to-day is this very tendency, still so deep- 
rooted, of considering mere learning as the sole objective 
of education. The obvious fact that knowledge does not
-P-A-G-E-297
  
  CURRICULUM AS A GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM 281 
necessarily function, and that the thoroughly useful per- 
son is the one who, knowing things, does them; the 
obvious fact, in other words, that education must ulti- 
mately consist in a process which affects the emotions, 
which motivates, which equips with habitual attitudes, is 
still too little known. 
Courses of study, implying only the mastery of sub- 
ject-matter and involving only the process of learning, 
are part of, but not coextensive with, curriculum. “The 
most important function of the school is to educate. In- 
struction preserves and transmits to mankind the treas- 
ures of acquired truth. Education enlightens man’s con- 
science, strengthens his judgment, and tempers his will. 
To think well, to judge well, and to be able to govern 
oneself are worth more than to know much. A school 
which does not educate, makes teaching a mere mechani- 
cal process, a calling without social significance, without 
dignity, without perspective.” ® 
Basic principles.—It will make for greater clarity of 
thought if we set down certain important, if obvious 
factors that must condition every step taken toward the 
solution of the problem of the curriculum. It is not pos- 
sible to set down a special set of principles for each of the 
links in the chain of the education of the child. Each 
school that he passes through is, for the child, but one 
step toward the general goal of education, however that 
goal may ultimately be defined. These goals, therefore, 
the objectives of education, dealing with single individ- 
uals, must be a single set. The contributions of various

-P-A-G-E-298
  282 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
links in the school system toward the ultimate objectives, 
in the education of the individual, may eventually be 
subdivided, but the objectives are single—so far as the 
individual is concerned, all the schools have the one aim. 
This objective has two phases. We are not preparing 
the individual to live alone. He will have not only to 
make adjustments, but also to make contributions, to 
carry his share of the load, to take responsibility for 
carrying forward the general welfare. On the other hand, 
we do not intend completely to submerge the interests 
of the individual to those of the group. That, fortunately, 
is no longer necessary. Within the group, we are prepar- 
ing for a many-sided development. The general goals, 
therefore, are to be in two principal groups, the individual 
and the social. 
In some respects, the formulation of the curriculum 
must be frankly a social process, in terms of social goals. 
But the worthiness of these goals must be carefully 
guarded. We do not admire the social philosophy on 
which selection for educational purposes was based in 
Germany. Social goals are, conceivably, of many kinds 
and vary in the degree of desirability. Economic goals, 
for example, take care of themselves. There are interests 
which make themselves heard when they are threatened 
as, for example, by lengthening the compulsory education 
period or by prohibiting child labor. These interests 
make clear the need for a vocational curriculum and con- 
sent to national subsidies for that purpose. The political 
goals of good citizenship are obvious, and are much to the 
fore in present educational discussion. The worthiness 
of these goals will depend on the excellence of our general 
political philosophy. On the other hand, the social cul-
-P-A-G-E-299
  
CURRICULUM AS A GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM 283 
tural goals, using the term in the narrow sense of the 
utmost popularization of the inheritance of the arts, and 
improvement of the general recreational tone, the use of 
leisure for the best in drama, music, literature, and the 
other arts—these goals have in our schools heretofore been 
neglected. To this set of goals we shall have occasion 
to return in the chapter on the psychological aspects of 
the curriculum. 
We in this volume are dealing with one particular 
school in the chain of education, the first school. The 
general educational goals established, the process for our 
purposes must be to inquire as to what portion of the 
problem comes within our field, what is our share. To- 
ward some of the goals we must make a beginning, though 
we shall not see the ultimate product. Some of the goals 
we do not specifically undertake at all, because the child 
is too immature from their point of view during the 
period that is assigned to the elementary school. Some 
of the goals we achieve entirely because it is possible to 
do so within the allotted period, and because the achieve- 
ment is essential for the next step in education. 
In other words, the elementary school will be expected 
to make a partial advance toward some of the ultimate 
goals of education as, for example, to begin the establish- 
ment of sound social and physical habits; as regards this 
section of its work, it must participate in the formulation 
of ultimate goals and aim directly at achieving them. 
The school is responsible for the beginning, but not the 
completion of, certain definite goals which are to be con- 
tinued in the next educational link, dealing with such 
subjects as history, geography, literature, and mathe- 
matics. As to these, the school must demand that the  
-P-A-G-E-300
  284 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
junior high school definitely clarify its prerequisites 
and that these prerequisites be attainable in order 
that the elementary school may have a clear vision 
of the requirements to be met. Finally, the school is re- 
sponsible for those of the goals which can be completed 
within the six years, such as the fundamental tools of 
reading and writing. This unit belongs almost entirely 
to the elementary school, and its complete and satisfac- 
tory achievement is taken for granted as basic in the 
junior high school. 
The work of the elementary school may go on to-day 
with the definite assumption that for none of the mentally 
normal children is this the only opportunity for educa- 
tion that the child will have and, further, that all the 
work is definitely conditioned by the present degree of 
maturity of the pupil community and by the valid de- 
mands of the junior high school. The elementary school 
carries the children to one boundary line in education 
and must conscientiously prepare them for the next step. 
To sum up, the elementary school— 
1. Does not participate in the achievement of some 
of these general goals. 
2. Considers some of these goals almost entirely with- 
in its scope. 
3. Makes a beginning toward, but does not actually 
achieve the others. Toward these its relation is 
of two kinds: 
(a) the quite general and not definitely measurable 
goals such as social and health habits. 
(b) those for which the junior high school may 
specify demands, and achievements in which may 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
  CURRICULUM AS A GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM 285 
be measured—goals which, unlike fundamental 
processes, do not belong entirely within the ele- 
mentary school, but toward which a beaneee 
may be made. 
The general educational goals have certain condition- 
ing factors of importance. In the first place no objec- 
tives can be laid down without regard to certain facts 
inherent in the lives of children. The educative process 
cannot, for example, be indefinite in duration. The aver- 
age length of human life is fairly stable. During the 
period of his education the child is provided leisure for 
that purpose at the cost of older members of the com- 
munity who are producers. The longer the period of 
preparation, the shorter the remaining period of produc- 
tivity. Too short a period of education may make the 
longer period of productivity less efficient, indicating that 
a longer period might have been invested wisely. Too 
long a period of education may make even efficient pro- 
ductivity too short to pay. Doubtless there is some point 
in the life of each individual beyond which freedom from 
productivity and from participation in the activities of 
life for purposes of preparation for such activity, is not 
economical from the social point of view, and begins to 
pay diminishing returns. This period, if it exists, must 
vary with the individual, depending on endowment, 
temperament, physical condition, and other factors. 
Even the short period of compulsory education is doubt- 
less too long for a certain proportion of the population. 
This fact of variation, again, probably invalidates the 
universality of educational goals. It may be that the 
variation takes care of itself in the differences of the de-
-P-A-G-E-302
  286 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
gree of achievement or approach to completing the goals, 
or it may be that different sets of goals must actually be 
set up, both as regards those from the point of view of the 
individual and those from the point of view of the social 
group. The days of blind and superstitious faith in edu- 
cational processes per se are definitely over. While we 
spend greater sums and energy than ever, while we gladly 
keep children at leisure for purposes of education for 
longer periods than ever before, the investment should 
be wisely made. Liberality should not be misdirected. 
Undoubtedly some children are to-day receiving more 
leisure and expenditure than they warrant, while others 
are not receiving enough either from the point of view 
of their individual happiness or from that of their possible 
contribution to society. We shall have to examine the 
human material and make the best possible use of it.7 
The fact that education must proceed on intellectual, 
emotional, and physical bases, and that variation occurs 
in all of these, will be referred to in detail later. 
An approach to the first problem of curriculum formu- 
lation—We must now face the first step of curriculum 
construction, i. e., the formulation of general goals. One 
of the earliest students of education who did formal 
thinking on the subject of the curriculum was Herbert 
Spencer. It is interesting to note that his work, which 
definitely pointed the way to the method of curriculum 
derivation now coming increasingly into use, was the 
result of a historical accident. Spencer was primarily in- 
terested not in the problem of the curriculum as: such, 
but in the place of science in the general scheme of edu- 
™See J. L. Horn, “Caring for Highly Endowed pie ”” The School 
Review, Vol. XXIX, p. 777.
-P-A-G-E-303
  
CURRICULUM AS A GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM 287 
cation. His great contribution toward curriculum discus- 
sion arose, not out of pure interest in curriculum formu- 
lation, but as the result of a controversy. He did formal 
thinking on the curriculum primarily for the purpose of 
indicating the great importance of science as one means 
of equipping the individual for modern life. Be that as 
it may, it was Spencer who first thought out a method of 
attacking this problem formally and deriving principles 
for curriculum construction on a sound and defensible 
basis. The student may best be introduced to Spencer’s 
method of attacking the problem by some quotations 
from his justly famed essay: “What Knowledge Is of 
Most Worth.” 
“Tf there needs any further evidence of the rude, unde- 
veloped character of our education, we have it in the fact 
that the comparative worths of different kinds of knowl- 
edge have been as yet scarcely even discussed—much lets 
discussed in a methodic way with definite results. Not 
only is it that no standard of relative values has yet been 
_ agreed upon; but the existence of any such standard has 
not been conceived in any clear manner. . . . The first in 
importance, though the last to be considered, is the prob- 
lem—how to decide among the conflicting claims of vari- 
ous subjects on our attention. Before there can be a 
rational curriculum, we must settle which things it most 
concerns us to know; or, to use a word of Bacon’s, now 
unfortunately obsolete—we must determine the relative 
values of knowledges. To this end, a measure of value 
is the first requisite. And happily, respecting the true 
measure of value, as expressed in general terms, there 
can be no dispute. Every one in contending for the worth 
of any particular order of information, does so by show- 
   
-P-A-G-E-304
  288 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
ing its bearing upon some part of life. In reply to the 
question, ‘Of what use is it?’ the mathematician, linguist, 
naturalist, or philosopher explains the way in which his 
learning beneficially influences action. . . . 
“How to live?—that is the essential question for us. 
Not how to live in the mere material sense only, but in 
the widest sense. The general problem which compre- 
hends every special problem is—the right ruling of con- 
duct in all directions under all circumstances. In what 
way to treat the body; in what way to treat the mind; 
in what way to manage our affairs; in what way to bring 
up a family; in what way to behave as a citizen; in what 
way to utilize all those sources of happiness which nature 
supplies—how to use all of our faculties to the greatest 
advantage of ourselves and others—how to live com- 
pletely?” ... 
“This test, never used in its entirety, but rarely even 
partially used, and used then in a vague, half-conscious 
way, has to be applied consciously, methodically, and 
throughout all cases. It behooves us to set before our- 
selves, and ever to keep clearly in view, complete living 
as the end to be achieved; so that in bringing up our 
children we may choose subjects and methods of instruc- 
tion, with deliberate reference to this end.” 
We have gone beyond Spencer in his unbounded faith 
in the functioning of knowledge. He seems to assume 
throughout that the end of education is to convey that 
knowledge which is of most worth. But we are continu- 
ing his very line of thought, and it is becoming almost 
universally accepted that the method of curriculum der- 
ivation is to look at complete living as the end to be 
achieved, to classify life’s activities and to select for
-P-A-G-E-305
  CURRICULUM AS A GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM 289 
school purposes such knowledge, habits, and experiences 
as will best achieve the purpose of complete and most 
fruitful participation in those activities. It is Herbert 
Spencer who gave us the key to the solution of the prob- 
lem, the means or method of procedure for scientific cur- 
riculum derivation. “To prepare us for complete living,” 
he states, “is the function which education has to dis- 
charge; and the only rational mode of judging of any edu- 
cational course is, to judge in what degree it discharges 
such function.” 
We have reached solid ground. We are to determine, 
first, rather broad and inclusive classifications of the ac- 
tivities of life, and to discuss thereafter how the school 
may best function to aid in preparing for and achieving 
full and complete living. Spencer made a direct attack 
on this problem, attempting not merely to group activi- 
ties, but to enumerate them in the order of their im- 
portance: 
“Our first step must obviously be to classify, in the 
order of their importance, the leading kinds of activity 
which constitute human life. They may be naturally ar- 
ranged into: (1) those activities which directly minister 
to self-preservation; (2) those activities which, by secur- 
ing the necessities of life, indirectly minister to self-pres- 
ervation; (3) those activities which have for their end 
the rearing and discipline of offspring; (4) those activi- 
ties which are involved in the maintenance of proper 
social and political relations; (5) those miscellaneous ac- 
tivities which make up the leisure part of life, devoted 
to the gratification of the tastes and feelings.” 
Although the statement of goals is changing and be- 
coming more clear; although, indeed, no statement of
-P-A-G-E-306
  290 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
goals can ever be regarded as fixed, either in time or in 
place, this method established by Spencer stands; namely, 
if you would know what to do with the time and energies 
of the child placed at your disposal and made your re- 
sponsibility, establish your objectives, and then proceed 
to outline your means of reaching them in terms of sub- 
ject-matter and of method, sequentially ordered and 
adapted psychologically in the terms of the child who is 
the subject of the educational process. 
The development of this process of curriculum formu- 
lation and its continuing refinement in procedure from 
the time of Spencer to the present may be seen rather 
clearly if, bearing in mind his contribution, we review 
the position of Professor Bobbitt, whose work represents 
an interesting example of conscious, deliberate curricu- 
lum thinking to-day. Spencer seems to rely for education 
rather heavily on the formal imparting of knowledge, 
whereas Bobbitt’s point of view is that education can be 
and in fact is, accomplished not only in school but every- 
where, and that some things are indeed better learned 
elsewhere and should not be dealt with in school. Only 
such things should be learned in school, thinks Professor 
Bobbitt, as can there be learned most economically. 
Again, Spencer tacitly assumes that education consists of 
conscious effort in the acquiring of knowledge, but Bob- 
bitt points out that educational advancement takes place 
on two levels of experience; namely, the play level and 
the work level, so that much desirable education is gained 
quite unconsciously and without deliberate supervision 
on the part of any institution. It follows then, that not 
all education takes place in the school for two reasons: 
first, that much of it occurs on what he calls the play
-P-A-G-E-307
    
CURRICULUM AS A GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM 291 — 
level, and secondly, that much of it can be better accom- 
plished outside of school. An insight into his theory of 
curriculum derivation may be had from the following 
excerpt: 
“The central theory is simple. Human life, however 
varied, consists in the performance of specific activities. 
Education that prepares for life is one that prepares 
definitely and adequately for these specific activities. 
However numerous and diverse they may be for any social 
class, they can be discovered. This requires only that 
one go out into the world of affairs and discover the par- 
ticulars of which these affairs consist. These will show 
the abilities, attitudes, habits, appreciations, and forms 
of knowledge that men need. These will be the objec- 
tives of the curriculum. They will be numerous, definite, 
and particularized. The curriculum will then be that 
series of experiences which children and youth must have 
by way of attaining these objectives. . . . The Curricu- 
lum is that series of things which children and youth 
must do and experience by way of developing abilities 
to do the things well that make up the affairs of adult 
life; and to be in all respects what adults should be. . . . 
“The curriculum of the schools will aim at those ob- 
jectives that are not sufficiently attained as a result of 
the general undirected experiences.” The goals, in gen- 
eral terms, as formulated by Bobbitt are: (1) training 
for occupational efficiency; (2) education for citizenship; 
(3) education for physical efficiency; (4) education for 
leisure occupations; (5) education for intereommuni- 
cation. 
Omitting, for the present, consideration of an exact 
formulation of the experiences, subjects, and methods as  
-P-A-G-E-308
292 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
well as consideration of which part of these experiences 
is better attained in school, and which in general undi- 
rected living, we must direct our attention to two other 
influential statements of the general goals of education: 
Professor Bonser in his recent stimulating attack on 
the problem of the elementary-school curriculum ® 
enumerates “four large fields of purposeful activity” as 
follows: “(1) Maintaining and preserving life and health 
through the use of the material necessities of life and 
the appropriate care of the body; (2) producing the 
necessities and luxuries for which man feels need, and 
making these available through exchange; (3) codperat- 
ing with others in maintaining the protective and regula- 
tive measures for the common good, the institutions of 
life, the family, the state, the vocation, the school, and 
the church; (4) occupying leisure in pursuits engaged 
in for the enjoyment which they yield.” These he re- 
states in other terms as follows: (1) health; (2) practi- 
cal efficiency; (3) citizenship; (4) recreation. 
Finally we come to a recent semiofficial statement of 
the goals of education made by the Commission on the 
Reorganization of Secondary Education. “The Commis- 
sion regards the following as the main objectives of edu- 
cation” and holds “that they should constitute the princi- 
pal aims in education”: (1) health; (2) command of the 
fundamental processes (of reading, writing, arithmetic, 
oral and written expression) ; (3) worthy home member- 
ship; (4) vocation; (5) citizenship; (6) worthy use of 
leisure; (7) ethical character. 
So much for the first step in curriculum construction.

CURRICULUM AS A GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM 293 
A formulation of goals, a discussion of the complete in- 
clusiveness of these goals, of their relative importance, 
of the conflicts or harmony that may exist as between 
the various statements of goals; their validity and finality 
will not be undertaken here. The eventual formulation 
may be left for still further consideration by the educa- 
tional public, always bearing in mind that very likely 
there will never be permanence of goals in a world that 
is constantly changing and under institutions that are 
constantly being subjected to criticism. It is enough 
that the method has been established. 
  Summary 
Notwithstanding its obvious importance as the central 
school point toward which all other activities must con- 
verge, the curriculum represents to-day an unsolved prob- 
lem, and current practice is being subjected to severe 
criticism. 
The comparatively short time that has elapsed since 
the establishment of universal public education in 
America; the fact that early efforts perforce concerned 
themselves with securing support and establishing the 
institution itself rather than with any philosophy of edu- 
cation; current changes in science, economic arrange- 
ments, and social ideals which naturally have their in- 
fluence in antiquating preceding curriculum ideas; the 
fact that the elementary school heretofore has been the 
sole, not the first school attended, which caused it to un- 
dertake certain activities essential for complete partici- 
pation in adult life, but which from an educational point 
of view might better have been deferred—these facts ex- 
plain in part the present curriculum situation. 
The elements of the problem of the curriculum as we
-P-A-G-E-310
  294 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
face it to-day are these: (1) The elementary school is 
a first, not a final school, doing away with the former need 
for overlapping and duplicating some of the work of the 
high school. (2) We must establish a just balance be- 
tween the child’s individual good and the social welfare. 
(3) Learning is not synonymous with education, hence 
course of study is not coextensive with curriculum, which 
term must include all the activities, including learning, 
calculated to affect conduct and lead to right, well rounded 
living. 
There are certain basic principles underlying a solution 
of this problem: (1) The fundamental educational goals 
must be single and the same for all schools, just as the 
education of the child must be continuous, leading to- 
ward these goals, regardless of the number of schools 
which assist him toward those ends. (2) These general 
goals are to be of two kinds, individual and social, and 
neither ideal may be achieved at the cost of the other. 
A just balance is to be maintained. 
The general educational goals established, we face next 
the question what the contribution of the elementary 
school toward their achievement is to be. In general, 
we may say (1) that some of these goals are excluded 
from the elementary school because of the immaturity 
of the child during the first six years of school; (2) that 
some of the goals, by virtue of their character as basic 
to further progress, belong almost entirely within the 
elementary school; and (3) that in the case of some of 
the goals, the school makes a beginning toward, but does 
not expect completely to achieve them within the allotted 
period. This last group is of two kinds: (a) quite general 
and not definitely measurable; (b) preparatory to second-
-P-A-G-E-311
  CURRICULUM AS A GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM 295 
ary education and definitely susceptible to specification 
and measurement. 
The formulation of curriculum objectives is conditioned 
by certain inescapable factors which must be allowed for, 
among them the following: (1) Human life has a defi- 
nite, fairly ascertainable duration, and the period that 
may be allowed for preparation is, therefore, definitely 
limited by that which is to remain for productivity. (2) 
The fact of variation among children means (a) that 
different compulsory periods should be provided, and (b) 
that within the period of education different sets of ob- 
jectives should be set up. (3) Education proceeds on 
physical, intellectual, and emotional lines, and from all 
three points of view we find variation. 
The present method of attacking the problem of the 
curriculum is to look at complete living as the end to be 
achieved, to classify life’s activities, and to select for 
school purposes such knowledge, habits, and experiences 
as will best achieve the purposes of complete and fruit- 
ful participation in those activities. Several attempts at 
a formulation of the ultimate objectives have been made. 
Assuming that no existing statement is probably com- 
plete, final, and fully satisfactory, we may adopt as a 
basis for our discussion the statement of educational ob- 
jectives made by the Commission on the Reorganization 
of Secondary Education, these being seven in number, as 
follows: (1) health; (2) command of fundamental proc- 
esses; (3) worthy home membership; (4) vocation; (5) 
citizenship; (6) worthy use of leisure; (7) ethical 
character.

Problems 
This chapter deals with one central problem regarding 
whose solution no claim of finality can be made. Obvi- 
ously, therefore, the task to which the student may de- 
vote himself in connection with this discussion is to test 
the validity of the proposed procedure, to attempt the 
formulation of new modes of attack, or to undertake re- 
finement and perfecting of processes in one of the sub- 
problems of the discussion such, for example, as making 
a definite boundary line in terms of expected achievement 
between the elementary and the junior high schools.

CHAPTER XIII 
THE CURRICULUM AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROBLEM 
The province of the elementary school_—We have 
seen, in a general way, the method that is being pursued 
in the formulation of broad educational goals. We come 
now to the more specific question of the province of the 
elementary school. The conclusion arrived at in the 
last chapter will be recalled, ie., that the elementary 
school, being definitely confined to the first six years of 
formal education and, consequently, dealing with a cer- 
tain stage of maturity, will probably not undertake to 
deal with every one of the established objectives of edu- 
cation, and that of those toward which it aims, the school 
will complete some and make a certain advance toward 
others, without expecting to see results within the period 
of the educative process. 
As regards these latter objectives, we may recognize 
two classes, those of a very general character, such as 
health and the social virtues which must continually go 
forward without any particular reference to formal steps, 
and those formal objectives which require sequential 
training and toward which, while completion is not asked, 
the school is expected to make a rather definite beginning 
on which the junior high school can count and build. 
We come then to a specific examination of the objec- 
tives, for the purpose of defining the sphere of the ele- 
297
-P-A-G-E-314
  
  298 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
mentary school. We may adopt for our purposes the ob- 
jectives outlined in the statement of the Commission 
on the Reorganization of Secondary Education, both be- 
cause it is a formal expression which represents an or- 
ganized group of educators and because, being the for- 
mulation of a secondary-school group, it gives us some 
indication of the boundary line which that school expects 
to establish and of the demands with which it expects 
the elementary school to comply. The objectives out- 
lined by the Commission, then, are seven in number: (1) 
health; (2) command of the fundamental processes; (3) 
worthy home membership; (4) vocation; (5) citizen- 
ship; (6) worthy use of leisure; and (7) ethical character. 
We must examine these objectives from the point of 
view noted above and determine which are without the 
province of the school, which are entirely within the prov- 
ince of the school, which are to be begun in school but of 
a general character, which are to be begun in school but 
of a formal character. 
Vocational training not in elementary school scope.— 
The elementary school is no place and the six-year period 
of its duration is no time for specific vocational education. 
In the first place, it represents the minimum period set 
for basic work of a general character. In the second 
place, the children of this school are too young for intro- 
duction to vocations. The fact that practically all Amer- 
ican communities now protect children under twelve from 
employment is sufficient to prove this. An attempt to 
introduce vocational work into the elementary school 
would approximate a method of nullifying this protection. 
Over-age children who might properly be given voca- 
tional work are, by the recommendation of the Commis-
-P-A-G-E-315
  
CURRICULUM AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROBLEM 299 
sion in which the present writer concurs, properly to be 
sent to the secondary school. The Commission definitely 
agrees with this exclusion of vocational education from 
the elementary school when it says that “the pupil should 
be assisted ordinarily at about twelve or thirteen years 
of age (and in the junior high school) to begin a pre- 
liminary survey of the activities of adult life and of his 
own aptitudes in connection therewith, so that he may 
choose, at least tentatively, some field of human endeavor 
for special consideration.” 
The fundamental processes.—Of the six remaining ob- 
jectives named by the Commission, are there any that 
belong completely within the province of the elementary 
school? “Much of the energy of the elementary school 
is properly devoted to teaching certain fundamental proc- 
esses, such as reading, writing, arithmetical computa- 
tions, and the elements of oral and written expression.” 
These, it has heretofore been assumed, are peculiarly and 
exclusively the province of the elementary school. But 
“the facility that a child of twelve or fourteen may ac- 
quire in the use of these tools is not,” in the opinion 
of the Commission, “sufficient for the needs of modern 
life. This is particularly true of the mother tongue.” 
This means that the work will, in part, be continued in 
the junior high school. It remains true, nevertheless, 
that training in the fundamental processes, the tools 
which underlie all else in modern civilization is peculiarly 
and almost entirely the work of the elementary school. 
The other objectives.—We note, then, that vocation 
in any technical sense is not properly an objective of the 
elementary school and that of the six remaining goals, 
none belongs to it with complete exclusiveness, although
-P-A-G-E-316
300 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
the achievement of skill in the fundamental processes is 
one of its main preoccupations. In so far as these proc- 
esses do not come entirely within the scope of the ele- 
mentary school and, too, in other fields such as history, 
geography, and literature, in which a beginning must be 
made because they belong quite definitely to the stage 
of maturity under discussion, boundary lines will ulti- 
mately have to be established between the elementary 
and the junior high schools. For the present, we may 
regard the non-tool and non-fundamental fields of human 
thought to which the elementary school introduces the 
child as contributing to the other five objectives of edu- 
cation still to be discussed, obviously general in character, 
namely health, worthy home membership, citizenship, 
worthy use of leisure, and ethical character. Toward 
these objectives the school must make a partial advance. 
For their ultimate attainment, it must lay a basis. 
The boundary line between the schools.—For the ac- 
complishment of these specific and more general tasks 
the elementary school must formulate a curriculum. 
Where then, is the boundary line between the elementary 
and the junior high school? So far in this volume we 
have deliberately expressed the dividing line in terms 
of age of the pupil. We have said that the 
elementary school is six years in duration and 
therefore ends at age twelve. The Commission makes 
the division in the same terms, basing its opinion on 
principles of psychology which indicate the desirability 
of beginning differentiation in terms of future activities 
at about age twelve. Can a finer boundary line be es- 
tablished? Can it be stated in educational rather than in 
chronological and therefore presumably psychological 
terms? The attempt has been made: 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
  CURRICULUM AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROBLEM 301 
“Tt is the purpose of the elementary school,” says Pro- 
fessor Bonser,! “to provide experience in meeting the 
common needs of ell, regardless of sex, vocation, or social 
status. Its content is made up of those activities in 
which every one must participate with a like degree of 
knowledge and skill and with like attitudes and apprecia- 
tions, in order that there may be a unified, efficient, and 
stable social life.’ The elementary school deals with 
“that period in which the activities are to be the same 
for all children. . . . As we pass upward from the ele- 
mentary school, the common element in school activities 
grows less and less as the work responds more and more 
to individual differences and needs, and as these in turn 
adapt themselves increasingly to the forms of vocational 
service in which individuals participate.” 
“To-day educational theory,” says Professor Davis,” 
“based upon physiological, psychological, and sociological 
studies of children and adolescents, leads definitely to the 
conclusion that elementary education—that is, education 
designed for youths before they reach the period of 
puberty—should be nearly uniform in character for all, 
and should have the following aims: (1) to acquaint chil- 
dren with the tools of culture; (2) to give moderate skill 
in the use of these tools; (3) to impart a fund of knowl- 
edge that shall include the larger concepts of the world 
and its life, together with the means of making adjust- 
ments thereto; and (4) to establish desirable physical, 
mental, and social habits. . . . By the time the child has 
reached the period of adolescence, therefore, it should 
be expected that he will have been made acquainted in

millan, 1920.)

a general way, with the world’s most important interests; 
will have acquired a well organized stock of useful knowl- 
edge and a discipline that will enable him, so far as his 
stage of development permits, to employ his powers ef- 
fectively; and will have made some advance toward the 
discovery of his own dominant aptitudes and interests. 
He should also know the more common forms of vo- 
cational activity and have had a glimpse of the roads that 
lead toward them.” 
Uniformity of procedure not possible.—All of these 
ideas have a dangerous sound. There is an assumption 
that differentiation between individuals commences at 
about age twelve, which should therefore mark the begin- 
ning of differentiated education; that preceding that age 
education should be universal and, by presumption, uni- 
form in character, devoting itself to the basic subjects 
and to the things that we all need in common. But the 
theory as stated is neither true psychologically nor pos- 
sible pedagogically. That we have clear ideas on this 
subject is most vital at the present stage of the develop- 
ment of formal public education in America. 
Individual differences are present before birth, and 
the fact that we ignore these differences in our educa- 
tional processes represents a greater loss to individuals 
and to society than is at present measurable. From the 
point of view of the educational objective of citizenship, 
for example, the difference between the potential states- 
man and the child whose utmost capacity will be taxed 
by the vocation of garbage-collecting, is marked and 
measurable before either of them enters the school. It 
is a political but not a psychological truth that “any boy 
may become president of the United States.”
-P-A-G-E-319
  CURRICULUM AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROBLEM 303 
From the point of view of the educational objective of 
worthy use of leisure, the difference between the child 
potentially able to enjoy symphonic music to the full and 
perchance to participate creatively in its production, and 
the child whose utmost capacity for emotional enjoyment 
will be taxed by the inescapable rhythm and the melodic 
‘ simplicity of the “popular” song, is equally well marked, 
although this is a variation which we cannot, unfortu- 
nately, for the moment measure. 
And so it goes with every other of the goals. In prep- 
aration for and anticipation of worthy home membership, 
vocation, and ethical character, it is useless to fail to 
note the fact of wide variation in potentiality. Enormous 
qualitative differences exist, and the complete education 
of the child demands that they be considered and not 
overlooked. Differences must be provided for within the 
elementary school. But the provision must be for quali- 
tative, not merely quantitative differentiation, for the dif- 
ferences in children are basic and permanent, not merely 
differences in rate of attaining similar ends. 
From some points of view, then, the thinkers quoted 
are right. In so far as the children are of approximately 
the same maturity; in so far as we do not desire to tres- 
pass on the secondary-school curriculum; in so far as we 
do not wish to provide electives and work leading to dif- 
fering careers; in so far as the work is to be distinctly 
preparatory for the next phase of education, the basis 
for another school to follow; in fine, from the com- 
munity’s point of view (quantitatively, in other words), 
the work is to be uniform and universal. But the uniform 
work is to be done differently in accordance with capacity. 
Unmodified, this is a truism hardly worth stressing. It
-P-A-G-E-320
ee OTR TO Rem trgee ar Ne MNEs DER RRC 7 AE rae etree age 
304 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
is timeworn knowledge in educational circles that chil- 
dren vary. But the point here made is that the work 
required of the children must be deliberately varied, and 
made to suit varying capacity by qualitative differen- 
tiation, within the uniform and universal scope of the 
elementary-school field. The school is aiming at general 
objectives. In conformity, then, with the fact that 
preparation is being made for health, command of 
fundamental processes, worthy home membership, voca- 
tion, citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and ethical char- 
acter, within this very scope and range, the school must 
make provision for variation in work approximating the 
variation in intensity and quality of ultimate potential 
achievement. 
A number of persons may each in turn sing the same 
tune correctly or play violins all conforming to the re- 
quirements of the notation, or describe the very same 
event without violating any of the rules of rhetoric or 
grammar. This is quantitative uniformity. In this sense 
the children will all be citizens, producers, members of 
families, and participants in recreation. In this sense a 
curriculum may be universal. But what a range of varia- 
tion is possible from the qualitative point of view! How 
the voices may vary in richness of tone and color; how 
differently the violins may sound in depth and round- 
ness of tone, and the expression of emotions; how drab 
one narrative may seem in comparison with the vivid- 
ness of the other! This is qualitative variation. 
The difference in performance between Kreisler and 
the pupil who knows his “piece” is not in accuracy, 
velocity, or any other of the characteristics that make for 
correctness. From a quantitative point of view the
-P-A-G-E-321
  \ 
CURRICULUM AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROBLEM 305 
master and the amateur both fulfil the requirements in 
toto. The difference between the artist and the mere 
performer is a qualitative one: a depth of feeling, a 
roundness of tone, a richness of color, a finesse of phras- 
ing—all aside from the quantitative demands. We ought 
not to blind ourselves to the discernible differences be- 
tween the future statesman, artist, philosopher, and the 
child whose capacity will be taxed by the simplest routine. 
Failure to recognize these differences is waste. To this 
subject we shall return in the next chapter. 
The boundary line is then, perhaps, best stated more or 
less arbitrarily in terms of chronological age. After all, 
age twelve conforms approximately to average child de- 
velopment from the point of view of maturity, not to 
mention the fact that the six-year school is best adapted 
to American conditions, resting on the historical evolution 
of the American school, and the character of the teaching 
personnel as now being trained in the United States in 
standard teacher-training institutions. 
Formulating procedure——Meanwhile we still have 
left for consideration this problem: how shall the ele- 
mentary school formulate a curriculum or formal pro- 
cedure that will make for the attainment of the rather 
general goals set down, toward which it must take the 
child a certain distance, conforming to his degree of ma- 
turity, and differing in accordance with varying capacity? 
In place of subjects of instruction to make up the courses 
of study for the various schools, we have set down rather 
vague general goals applicable to all. But the school 
must organize its tasks from day to day with a view to 
attaining these objectives. How shall this be done? 
Shall we select from and teach the old information and
-P-A-G-E-322
  306 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
skills with a clearer view than heretofore to their ef- 
ficacy in achieving our goals, or is it possible to create 
something “new under the sun,” to strike out de novo 
and, freed from all tradition, devise a means toward our 
ends, a procedure tending to accomplish our educational 
objectives? If we decide on the latter course and achieve 
success, shall we have changed the subject-matter, the 
material, and the skills to be mastered, or merely the 
procedure? Shall we have made our contribution to cur- 
riculum or to method? 
It is to be taken for granted that we no longer place 
faith in the efficacy of mere mastery of subject-matter; 
furthermore, we realize that the subject-matter we use as 
material for instruction is not settled, fixed, and eternal, 
but in process of change. “Whatever society sets up as 
the ends for the conduct of its members . . . becomes 
the standard of reference by which to determine the con- 
tent of the school work in so far as these ends cannot be 
just as well attained without the help of the school.” ® 
Yet the fact remains that in modern civilized society 
the need for a “command of fundamental processes” also 
remains as one constant and stable factor of curriculum 
making, and furthermore, that it is an objective that will 
always remain the particular function of the elementary 
school. 
But the specific character of the subject-matter to be 
used in the service of education must be derived as al- 
ready indicated in the quotation from Professor Bonser. 
Methods of derivation at the present time show some 
variation. Professor Bobbitt,t aiming “at those objec- 
*F. G. Bonser, The Elementary School Curriculum, p. 
*F. Bobbitt, The Curriculum, pp. 48, 44. (eiaughian Mittin, 1918.)
-P-A-G-E-323
  
CURRICULUM AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROBLEM 307 
tives that are not sufficiently attained as a result of the 
general undirected experience,” holds that the task is to 
“discover the total range of habits, skills, abilities, forms 
of thought, valuations, ambitions, ete.,” needed for ef- 
fective participation in the five great groups of activities 
enumerated by him; namely, occupational efficiency, cit- 
izenship, physical efficiency, leisure occupations, and 
social intercommunication. 
Presumably an ever finer division of these fields, and 
the determination and listing of the skills needed for ef- 
fective functioning in each, will lead us to the enumera- 
tion of a vast number of skills and abilities that will be 
duly tabulated. Having made the studies which he sug- 
gests by means of investigation of the successful perform- 
ance of function in the world at large, will we be enabled 
in the long run to do away with a synthetic organization 
of these abilities under formal heads that will look very 
much like “fundamental processes” and subjects of in- 
struction? Is it not, after all, \possible that these 
processes and subjects of instruction already represent 
in logical succession the very skills that have been found 
necessary, undoubtedly weighted with some no longer 
needed and still lacking some that must be used in our 
contemporary world? It is doubtless true that the tradi- 
tional curriculum includes “much that makes no desirable 
difference in conduct” and omits “much that is of very 
great significance for the conduct of life.’> But these 
faults are not inherent in any particular method of cur- 
riculum formulation. They are inherent in social progress 
and evolution. Given time enough, any formulation of

 Inillan, 1920.)
-P-A-G-E-324
  308 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
procedure, no matter how derived, whether classified as 
subjects or not, will be chargeable with the same faults. 
They are not fundamental; they are, therefore, 
remediable. 
Will these means of deriving the curriculum in the 
long run do away with the old subjects properly adjusted 
to modern current life and made effective and function- 
ing instead of being taught for their own sake, possibly 
synthesized in accordance with the project idea and elim- 
inating arbitrary division lines now existing, as for ex- 
ample, between history and geography? Is Professor 
Bobbitt’s method leading in the right direction? Can we 
talk in terms of goals and subsidiary skills to the ex- 
clusion of subjects, or shall we have goals in order to test 
the efficacy of any given subject or division of the sub- 
ject now taught to see whether it serves its purpose: 
whether too much that is useful is excluded, whether 
enough that is useful is included? 
Turning to Professor Bonser’s mode of deriving the ma- 
terial of the curriculum, we find that he quite properly 
attacks the erroneous “assumption that the activity 
chiefly called upon” is “learning the material represented 
by the curriculum” and “developing a small number of 
skills in interpreting symbols and expressing meanings 
by their use” and in “memorizing the content of some 
text-books.” * He points out that.in the past there has 
been an absence of relationship to activities in which the 
skills and knowledge learned at school are useful. The 
child has been taught subjects as abstractions rather than 
as functioning information and skills in actual contact 
with the situation in which these are useful. The remedy 
“Ibid. p. 1.
-P-A-G-E-325
CURRICULUM AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROBLEM 309 
which he proposes is to do away with dissociations, to in- 
clude life situations, not to use abstractions as such for 
educational purposes—to teach in terms of life activities. 
But is not this a point of view on method to 
be followed (a point to which we shall return in our 
next chapter) rather than a new demand regarding the 
curriculum material itself? When he comes to a der- 
ivation of the actual material itself that is to be used as 
a means toward the educational goals by the new 
methods, he finds that we have a twofold source to draw 
upon; namely, the experience of present day life and the 
results of the experiences of the race in carrying on these 
activities. From these fields, he says, we are to select our 
material, bearing in mind the ultimate goals set down, 
and excluding such as may as well be attained out of 
school as in school. We are to bear in mind, too, the value 
of the individual as an acting, thinking, and feeling being, 
whose conduct is controlled by (1) knowledge or informa- 
tion, (2) habits or attitudes, and (3) appreciations. But 
all of these consist again merely of rules, laws, and prin- 
ciples, that are to guide us in selection, rules calling for 
elimination from and addition to the old standard 
subjects. 
Is this thinking primarily a contribution to material 
or to method? Is there really such a thing as a “pro- 
ject curriculum” in any other sense than that of method? 
The fields of information, the character of the skills, do 
after all remain stable, though combined in a way to 
eliminate artificial and really non-existing boundaries, 
vivified by proper methods which show the old subjects 
as actually functioning in situations of use and interest 
to the child. Presented not for their own sake, but inci-
-P-A-G-E-326
  310 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
dentally as means of reaching large life purposes, these 
fields, nevertheless, remain: nature study, industrial arts, 
geography, arithmetic, history, English, physical educa- 
tion, music and fine arts.” 
The furthest and most radical apparent deviation from 
traditional methods of curriculum derivation is that of 
Professor Meriam. In his book, “Child Life and the Cur- 
riculum” he actually enumerates new “subjects.” “Four 
‘subjects,’ ”” he says,® “are used throughout the school”; 
namely, (1)observation; (2) play; (3) stories, including 
music, poetry, and pictures; and (4) handwork. These 
four subjects of instruction he has established after a 
doubtless merited and thorough criticism of the 
traditional curriculum, and the announcement of six 
principles as bases for the construction of his new one, 
namely: (1) “The curriculum should contribute primarily 
to enabling boys and girls to be efficient in what they are 
now doing, only secondarily to preparing them to be 
efficient later. (2) The curriculum should be selected di- 
rectly from real life and should be expressed in terms of 
the activities ‘and environments of people. (3) The cur- 
riculum should provide for great scope and flexibility to 
meet individual differences in interests and abilities. (4) 
The curriculum should be so organized that it will admit 
of easy rearrangement of the schedule for any day, of the 
work for any grade, and even of the transfer of work from 
grade to grade. (5) The curriculum should lead the pupil 
to appreciate both work and leisure and to develop a 
habit of engaging in both.” ®

Book S. 1920.) See Table of Contents.
-P-A-G-E-327
  CURRICULUM AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROBLEM 311 
This apparently is the clearest swing, the most daring 
attack de novo on the curriculum problem. But what, 
after all, are Professor Meriam’s goals? Is he really 
changing the traditional subject-matter and substituting 
in its place new subjects, or are his so-called subjects 
merely a new method, a device for doing what the schools 
have always done, and what after all must always be 
done? “However plausible the theory and practice of the 
proposed change in the elementary-school curriculum 
may seem,” he says, referring to the work carried on in 
the University Elementary School and described in the 
volume under discussion, “the question really arises: 
How well will these pupils do their work in the traditional 
high school . . . without studying arithmetic, grammar, 
etc., in the grades?” 1° Is it a fact, however, that Pro- 
fessor Meriam’s pupils do not study arithmetic and gram- 
mar in the grades? The answer is quite clearly furnished 
by himself:" “In no place in this volume is it proposed 
that pupils should not learn in school to read, write, and 
cipher. It is contended, however, that a better content 
for study can be provided; and in the study of this con- 
tent pupils will acquire the ability to read, write, and 
cipher as well as or better than in the traditional school.” 
It is not true then, as indicated in the quoted question, 
that children do not study these subjects in the ele- 
mentary school at the University of Missouri. It is true 
in effect that they study these subjects in a different man- 
ner; incidentally, through novel methods by which in- 
stead of grouping subjects under the old arbitrary ab- 
stract division they are all combined and regrouped for

-P-A-G-E-328
312 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
purposes of instruction under four new heads, namely, 
observation, play, stories, and handwork. We have here 
a contribution to method. Instead of the formal pre- 
sentation of subjects such as might be indicated by logic, 
we have the casual learning incidental to apparently dif- 
ferent activities, simulating in that way the undirected 
learning by experience that life holds for most people. — 
But play, stories, observation, and handwork are not — 
curriculum, not content, not material. They are pro- | 
cedure—a teaching device. | 
Have we not, then, in the case of Dr. Meriam’s thesis 
arrived at the same conclusion to which a study of Dr. 
Bonser’s contribution had already led us, ie., that an im- 
portant part of current discussion which presumably deals 
with curriculum really involves method rather than con- 
tent material? Some contribution toward the selection of 
material there is, as may be seen from Professor Meriam’s 
five principles. The application to practice by these 
thinkers of Rousseau’s philosophy and theory, that the 
material of education should deal with the immediate 
experiences and interests of children and the future will 
take care of itself, is important. This practice, tending 
as it does to adapt work to their degree of maturity, to 
do away with empty words and phrases, and to provide 
in their place activities that command interest and effort 
does represent real contribution to curriculum recon- 
struction. 
But in the main the changes we have been discussing 
must be regarded as new methodology. It seems evident 
that, like other present thinkers on the elementary school, 
Professor Meriam is experimenting with the project. He 
makes the old material of the school incidental, but in- 
cidental learning of old material represents novelty of
-P-A-G-E-329
CURRICULUM AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROBLEM 313 
method, not of curriculum.’? The things mastered remain 
reading, writing, and arithmetic, and not observation, 
play, and stories. These latter are incidental to the 
former. The fundamental processes after all remain the 
goal at the University of Missouri Elementary School, as 
they do elsewhere. 
Material and method no longer separable concepts. 
—The conclusion forced upon us by the foregoing analysis 
of the attempts at the formulation of curriculum prin- 
ciples on the part of three students of the subject, is that 
the curriculum as material and the curriculum as method 
can now hardly be separated. At least three elements 
enter into any consideration of the curriculum; namely, 
the material of instruction or course of study proper, the 
nature of the child considered from the point of view of 
general psychological development, as well as from the 
point of view of variation; and finally method of attain- 
ing objectives. All these three together constitute the 
true curriculum, so that the word itself can no longer be 
used as a term synonymous with course of study. 
It is characteristic of modern educational discussion 
that certain age-old boundary lines fixing definite fields 
of thought are vanishing. It has always been customary 
to speak of course of study and method as two distinct 
fields. But when we talk of the business of the school in 
terms of educational goals, and set up specific objectives 
for attainment, we must realize that education, which in 
effect means the attainment of these goals, consists of 
method and materials indistinguishably. The formation 
of habits of citizenship and worthy use of leisure presup- 
pose method as inevitably as subject-matter. 
The pure objective determination of goals is mainly a 
™See p. 277 of his book. 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
  314 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
sociological function. A study of means of reaching these 
goals is largely determinable by psychological means. 
But the two are not so easily separable as heretofore, and 
so, in a preceding chapter which dealt with classifica- 
tion of children for the purpose of instruction, we in- 
evitably discussed curriculum, and in this chapter on cur- 
riculum proper, we unavoidably invade to some extent 
the field of method, which forms the principal topic of 
another chapter. 
Overlapping is unavoidable. The old artificial clarity 
of discussion no longer holds. Fundamentally the reasons 
for this overlapping are to be found in the complexity 
and intensity of life itself; and the approximation of edu- 
cational discussion to this complexity and away from the 
too simple formalism of the past, is really a sign of vi- 
tality. Life, itself, is very complex and its activities are 
not all susceptible to discussion under clear-cut classifi- 
cation. A mother is quite likely to give a child a lesson 
in good manners when she is presumably engaged in pur- 
chasing his shoes, and the street urchin is very likely ac- 
quiring invaluable instruction in arithmetic when he is 
presumably engaged in the business of selling newspapers. 
The course of study as a means to an end.—This new 
methodology is vital and valid. We shall return to it in 
the chapter on that subject. Meanwhile we have reached 
the point where, having noted that the material of in- 
struction, the skills to be acquired, must remain funda- 
mentally the same so long as society retains its present 
characteristics, this material should be definitely formu- 
lated. Always bearing in mind that the material is sub- 
ject to constant change, with the social progress, the 
development of new ways of living, and even the develop-
-P-A-G-E-331
  
CURRICULUM AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROBLEM 315 
ment of new ideas; conceding that the subjects need not 
be taught individually but may better be handled in com- 
bination and in disregard of logical and learned boundary 
lines; conceding that we have need of constant revision 
to eliminate the obsolete and merely traditional and to 
include the newest and currently useful knowledge and 
skills; conceding all of this, the fact remains that we need 
for to-day a formulation of this material from the several 
points of view of the school. 
Sociologically, it must be useful and timely in ac- 
cordance with the principles we have been discussing. 
Psychologically, it must be in terms of the maturity 
status of the children under discussion. From the con- 
crete view of instruction, it must be in goals attainable 
by the average child within the six-year limit and progres- 
sively organized in terms not necessarily logical, but 
rather psychological, following the known laws of de- 
velopment and learning. What then is this material 
which the school must use? Because the work of formu- 
lating courses in the various subjects from these points of 
view has been done by a number of devoted students who 
have given years of labor and of experience to the task, 
a discussion of this specific material will not be under- 
taken here. Their work is referred to in the bibliography 
at the end of this chapter. Mere repetition would be 
futile.   
Summary 
Adopting for purposes of our discussion the objectives 
outlined by the Commission on the Reorganization of 
Secondary Education, and following the principles of pro- 
cedure outlined in the last chapter, we find, (1) that the
-P-A-G-E-332
316 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
elementary school should not concern itself with prepara- 
tion for vocation; (2) that training in the fundamental 
subjects belongs almost entirely within the elementary 
school; and (3) that of the five remaining objectives, the 
elementary school (a) takes a share in establishing cer- 
tain habits, attitudes, and ideals suitable to the child’s 
degree of development, and (b) makes certain formal 
preparation of several non-fundamental subjects such as 
history, geography, music, drawing, and literature, on 
which the junior high school may count and build in aim- 
ing toward the general goals. 
The character of this latter work has not yet been de- 
fined either by the elementary school in terms of what is 
possible of achievement, or by the junior high school in 
terms of what is required as basic for its work. Indeed, 
the boundary line between the schools in terms other 
than attained age is difficult to establish. The idea of dif- 
ferentiation, indicating that elementary-school training is 
uniform and universal and that educational differentia- 
tion conforming to variation in the pupil group begins 
in the junior high school, is faulty. Children differ from 
birth. At the time they enter school these differences are 
marked and, in part, measurable. Educational processes 
should conform to these facts. 
When we examine the various attempts at a reformula- 
tion of the procedure of the elementary-school curriculum 
for the purpose of achieving the goals set, we find that, 
apart from a natural elimination of obsolete, and ad- 
dition of current information and skills, recent thinking 
on the problem tends to be a contribution to method 
rather than to material of instruction. Society and social 
practice remaining stable, the material of instruction re-
-P-A-G-E-333
  
CURRICULUM AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROBLEM 317 
mains much the same. The process required from this 
point of view is an examination of the material of in- 
struction and a revision of this material with a view to 
the goals in the attainment of which it is to assist. 
From this point of view, the material should be currently 
useful and applicable, psychologically apt for the par- 
ticular age, and educationally attainable. 
An examination of the material of instruction is not 
undertaken in this chapter, because such a discussion 
would be a gratuitous repetition of the results of excel- 
lent work by others now available and indicated in the 
bibliography. 
Problems 
One of the most important problems arising out of 
the discussion of this chapter involves the specific formu- 
lation of an elementary-school curriculum that will map 
the work of that school toward the attainment of the five 
general goals, exclusive of vocation and mastery of the 
fundamental or tool subjects. This problem has two 
phases: 
1. In the field involving largely information and skills, 
such as music, drawing, history, geography, and com- 
position, what should be the expected product of the six- 
year elementary school, bearing in mind (a) the legiti- 
mate demands of the junior high school, and (b) the 
attainable results within the several limitations of the 
elementary school? An exact formulation and agreement 
between the schools will ultimately eliminate duplica- 
tion and overlapping and replace these with a continuous 
educational process, At present there is very little 
theory.

2. In the field involving largely habits, ideals, and 
attitudes such as make for citizenship, worthy use of 
leisure, and worthy home membership, what should be 
the expected and if possible measurable product of the 
six-year elementary school, bearing in mind the attain- 
able results for this age-period?

CHAPTER XIV 
PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF CURRICULUM FORMULATION 
The nature of the child a conditioning factor—We 
have discussed, in the two preceding chapters, the 
general objectives of education, and the specific function 
of the elementary school as one educational phase of the 
progress toward the achievement of these objectives. 
But these objectives cannot be formulated in the air. 
They are not similar to a set of goals which a general sets 
himself before a battle, with the undoubting assumption 
that his commands will be obeyed, that all he has to do 
to see the forces move is to issue his commands. The 
achievement of educational goals is distinctly conditioned 
by psychological factors, such as maturity, intelligence, 
emotion, and, most troublesome of all, variation in every 
distinguishable characteristic. The children may all make 
the same start, but they will soon scatter at points 
along the line toward the designated goal. Even where 
they apparently cover the same ground, variation is def- 
initely noticeable. They may sing the same song, but 
they will not sing it in the same way. 
Again, the very naming of the goals must be condi- 
tioned by the same factors. Some of the goals, such as 
vocation, are rather definitely social, and the type of 
group organization in which the individual participates 
is such that motivation is automatically provided. The 
319 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  320 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
goal of some degree of productive participation will per- 
force be more or less well achieved. On the other hand, 
the worthy use of leisure is so distinctively an individual 
matter that, failing motivation provided by the school, 
it may never be achieved. Then again, some of the goals, 
such as a command of the fundamental processes, call 
primarily on the exercise of intellectual capacities and 
instruction ends in rather definitely measurable results. 
The achievement or failure to achieve these results is as- 
certainable. But other of the goals, such as good citizen- 
ship, depend on emotional reactions and the formulation 
of habitual responses to situations, most of which are to 
function after the child has left the school. Measurement 
and prognosis of achievement in this part of the cur- 
riculum is, for the present, almost an impossibility. 
And so we see that the psychological factors which 
condition the formulation and functioning of the cur- 
riculum, must be considered. But it is not intended in 
this chapter to deal with the entire problem of the psy- 
chological phases of curriculum formulation. That field 
must be left to thinkers in educational psychology. We 
are to deal here with two aspects, namely, emotional de- 
velopment and the factor of variation as these affect the 
curriculum, not because they are psychological in nature, 
but because they represent unsolved problems in elemen- 
tary education with which the teacher must deal, and 
which he can no longer neglect. The psychological 
problems proper, as we shall see, are far from solved. | 
These must be left to the psychologist. But pedagogy 
has not yet adjusted itself in the two particular topics | 
to be discussed, to the findings so far made and formu- 
lated by the students of educational psychology. These 
must engage our attention.  
-P-A-G-E-337
  ASPECTS OF CURRICULUM FORMULATION 321 
I, The Training of the Emotions as a Problem of 
the School 
The school has failed to function in emotional devel- 
opment.—“The curriculum should provide for all phases 
of behavior,” says Professor Bonser, “acting, thinking, 
and feeling.” In facile agreement with this obvious 
axiom it is commonly conceded that the curriculum must 
make provision for rounded and full development of every 
aspect of living in modern society. Nevertheless, it is 
fair to say that the school has hitherto concerned itself 
not at all with the emotional life of the child or the future 
adult. Assuming that the manual and other motor skills 
as well as the intellectual capacities necessary for func- 
tioning in modern society have been developed in school 
with reasonable satisfactoriness, it is probably not unfair 
to say that so far as emotional development is concerned, 
if one means by this an ability to appreciate and par- 
ticipate in the cultural heritage of the race, the schools 
have proved a complete failure. 
The American population, graduates of the elementary 
school, and to some considerable extent of the high school, 
can read, write, and cipher for all practical purposes. 
But in their leisure hours, music, the literary theater, and 
others of the arts are to them still largely segregated fields 
relegated to the world of “high-brows.” Even those who 
for any purpose concede the necessity and desirability of 
cultivating these fields, work at, rather than enjoy the 
process. It is true that educators are agreed regarding 
the need of developing the appreciations and providing 
for the most fruitful use of the constantly increasing mar- 
gin of leisure that is coming into our society; it is equally 
true that the schools have in detail made no provision 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
322 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
for the development of these appreciations and this emo- 
tional life. 
This is a social question not lightly to be passed over. 
The American people probably compare favorably with 
any other racial or national grouping in intelligence. 
They compare as favorably from the point of view of 
wealth, which means, or ought to mean, in effect, the 
power to command leisure and to make life beautiful. 
All the usual inspirations for song and story, for music 
and the graphic arts, are to be found among us. But 
these arts lead an esoteric, petted, orphan existence. 
They are not indigenous. 
This merely means, in effect, vast resources for beauti- 
ful living unutilized. It means on the part of the masses 
failure to participate and, on the part of the potential 
few, failure to create. It means, within all the safe- 
guards of modern material civilization, spiritual savagery. 
It means crass and comparatively low standards where 
we might have noble ones. 
There is a superstition that such things take care of 
themselves, that “if it is in you it will come out.” But 
this is not true. Rather is it a fact as Hayward points 
out,! that “the grandeurs and the beauties of the Alps 
and the Highlands pass unnoticed for generations; then 
some one brings the discerning eye and removes the scales 
from eyes that are not discerning; what was formerly the 
spiritual wealth of one becomes the currency of all.” 
Almost every one has personally experienced the simple 
truth that it is possible to be blind to surrounding beauty 
until it is pointed out to him. And the process of point- 
nth) H. Hayward, The Lesson in Appreciation, p. 189. (Macmillan,
-P-A-G-E-339
ASPECTS OF CURRICULUM FORMULATION 323 
ing out, in most arts, means specific training for enjoy- 
ment. The power to enjoy art is not a natural one, such 
as the operation of the instincts. The tiresome expres- 
sions, “I like music but I don’t know much about it,” and 
“T don’t know much about art, but I know what I like,” 
are mostly sham. With the fewest exceptions, real en- 
joyment of the arts must be prepared for by training, for 
the simple reason that their practice is not natural. The 
arts represent an artificial refinement, perfected by the 
ages, and their appreciation requires abilities less only in 
degree than the ability required for their creation. The 
very beginnings of art, such as the crude dance of the 
savage expressing an innate sense of rhythm, may be 
natural. But man is not born to-day with any natural 
ability either to understand or to enjoy the form and 
content of a symphony or a sonnet. The very history of 
the arts, outlining as it does their slow development 
through the ages from the crudest beginnings to highly 
developed forms, is enough to indicate the truth of this 
contention. What it takes one man a lifetime to pre- 
pare for and to execute, another cannot enjoy offhand. 
These abilities to enjoy and to create we do not as a 
nation possess in any measure commensurate with our 
status in other fields, and with our possibilities. The 
achievement of our full share of these noblest of human 
potentialities, it is the business of the schools to aid in 
accomplishing. As has been pointed out in preceding 
chapters, the modern home is increasingly abdicating to 
the school its former function as the agency for nurture. 
Furthermore, the public schools of a democracy are 
peculiarly charged with developing the social good. There 
is nothing miraculous about the attainments of the an- 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
  324 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
cient Greeks in the realm of beautiful living. It is pos- 
sible for a modern democratic people who command easy 
means of material existence and hence ample leisure, and 
who live amidst natural beauties unsurpassed, to make 
their material and spiritual environment as rich in beauty 
as was ever that of Athens. This, then, is a problem of 
the elementary school. 
Reasons for this failure—There are several important 
reasons for our lack so far; one of these is the fact that 
the school, which always has relied on the intellectual 
process, proceeds to intellectualize the new subjects and 
activities which are particularly calculated to enrich 
emotional life. To be concrete, music, drawing, and lit- 
erature are unlike arithmetic, handwriting, and grammar. 
They are primarily calculated to give pleasure, to affect 
the emotions rather than the intellect. It is quite true 
that in each instance there is a basic technic which must 
be mastered by the mind, and in which some skills must 
be developed, but these are not the true ends. They are 
basic means toward the real purpose, which is enjoyment. 
But the school, which has a tradition of appealing to 
the thinking processes, has treated these new additions 
to the curriculum in its old manner. It has taken on 
music and literature but it has treated them exactly as 
it has treated arithmetic, grammar, and penmanship. It 
has intellectualized them. Data regarding the biography 
of authors; careful examination of a novel or drama in 
order to master its plot; even careful notation of the fact 
that the composition in hand is considered good literature 
—these are all non-emotional processes, not at all cal- 
culated to develop that reaction which will make the 
pupil a participant in the joy of literature. “In the
-P-A-G-E-341
  
ASPECTS OF CURRICULUM FORMULATION 325 
average school, the music or poetry lesson is not, in point 
of fact, widely different from the arithmetic lesson. . . . 
We have never realized the significance and the function 
of appreciation; we have confused it with technic, and 
through this confusion we have destroyed appreciation.” ? 
The school is easily enough convicted; questionnaires 
as to the reading matter of high school and college stu- 
dents, apparently always bring the same disclosures; 
namely, that the work in literature does not function, 
that students for real pleasure go to sources not approved 
by the school. The point need hardly be stressed. The 
profitable and well supported movie and theater do not 
produce the type of amusement most calculated to carry 
on.a tradition of high art. Good drama, good music, good 
graphic art are almost everywhere in America subsidized 
as a luxury by the very wealthy. They are almost every- 
where in America exotic. They almost nowhere grow out 
of and respond to an inner need of the population trained 
in liberally supported public schools. The school intel- 
lectualizes all of the arts; it teaches the skills, the 
mechanisms, but does not develop emotional reaction. 
Another explanation on historical grounds is possible 
for this failure of the school to provide for the emotional 
development of children and to create a responsiveness 
to the arts. Education for the masses is a recent institu- 
tion and the elementary school, intended primarily for the 
masses, has naturally been always a rudimentary school. 
Its courses have been utilitarian and brief, intended 
primarily to aid the state. In other words, they have 
been intellectual rather than emotional. The arts have 
not belonged to the masses, but have always led the

existence of pet children subsidized as a luxury by wealthy 
patrons; rarely have they represented a robust response 
to the needs of the people. The democratization of the 
arts, as part of the process of general social democratiza- 
tion and general mass participation in a fuller social and 
community heritage, can hardly be said to have begun. 
On the other hand, the patrician has always received 
and still receives his training in the appreciation of the 
arts at home, from the very environment and by the mere 
operation of nurture. It has not been customary for the 
school to concern itself with the emotional development 
of the child. In the secondary school which historically 
catered to the select, such training was unnecessary be- 
cause art appreciation was bred in the blood and imbibed 
from the environment. The people’s school, starting 
humbly as a rudimentary school limited to a few 
utilitarian ends, has never developed a technic for form- 
ally taking over this cultural inheritance for the mass. 
When it did take on music, literature, drawing, and other 
of the expressions of the purely emotional life, it intel- 
lectualized them, and has been proceeding as if the true 
theory were based on a mere development of skills, as, 
for example: reading musical notation.® 
New procedure essential.—But the gulf between know- 
ing and doing will never be bridged, and the use of in- 
formation as a means of influencing conduct will never 
be established, until the school has learned how to affect 
the child’s emotions. We must become aware of the 
futility of mere knowledge, and the need of developing 
a technic for establishing function. “Whatever makes a

difference in conduct which helps to meet any real need 
has educational value in just the degree that it makes 
such a difference. . . . Aside from the difference in con- 
duct made by experiences of any kind there is no basis 
for judging their worth.” 4 
There has been considerable agitation in recent years 
in regard to the failure of the so-called old civics instruc- 
tion to function. It has been repeatedly pointed out that 
memorizing the Federal Constitution is no way to make 
good citizens; but neither is the new Civics, substituting . 
as it does other information in place of a knowledge of 
the machinery of the Federal Government, going to func- 
tion. As mere knowledge, information concerning the 
city street-cleaning department will probably be as futile 
as knowledge concerning the manner in which a bill is 
passed through Congress. Good citizenship involves 
volition: a desire to be a good citizen. This wish is 
emotion, not information. Civics, along with all other 
subjects which primarily affect emotions, will have to be 
reorganized in the curriculum. 
The school has not absolutely ignored the existence of 
the emotional life. In its attempt to motivate work by 
the use of such devices as the project and the problem, 
and in its attempt to stimulate by its appeal to such in- 
stincts as rivalry and loyalty, it has been dealing with 
emotions. In this procedure it has, however, been using 
the emotions of the child for its own ends of intellectual 
achievement. All the procedure has consisted of learn- 
ing and teaching devices. It has not been a process of 
emotional development as an end in itself.

millan, 1920.)

Curriculum objectives divisible into two classes.—It 
has been stated in the foregoing pages that the present 
method of deriving the curriculum is to outline a series 
of objectives for the work of the school. From the point 
of view of this discussion we note that it will be necessary 
to divide these formulated objectives into at least two 
groups, by asking concerning them whether these goals 
are primarily intellectual or primarily emotional. School 
procedure will have to be organized in terms of this 
knowledge. It is futile to think that objectives primarily 
emotional can be attained by the same tried methods as 
are now used to attain objectives primarily intellectual. 
The school is beginning to understand all this. In place 
of physiology, which formerly stressed such achievements 
as memorizing the names of the teeth, teachers are now 
conducting tooth-brush drills—a patently more effective 
process. But the entire school will have to be formally 
reorganized on this basis. Means will have to be devised 
for conscious effort to affect the emotional life of the 
child; to establish habits and attitudes, which will in the 
end succeed in really democratizing the arts, in really 
transmitting to the vast mass the precious sources of 
spiritual happiness to which the very few now have ac- 
cess. As we have too frequently seen in this discussion, 
educational goals, in terms of subject-matter enumeration 
as an ultimate end, will no longer serve. The curriculum 
will consist of a series of goals together with appropriate 
material and methods for attaining these goals. The 
goals will be known either as primarily intellectual or as 
primarily emotional, and in accordance with this knowl- 
edge proper means will be devised. 
Nonexistence of established pedagogical practice.— 
But these means in turn will depend on psychological
-P-A-G-E-345
  ASPECTS OF CURRICULUM FORMULATION 329 
investigation for the purpose of determining the character 
of the emotional life. At the present time we are almost 
entirely ignorant of any pedagogical means for inducing 
emotions. Although it is obvious enough, from the ex- 
amples in civics and physiology which have been cited, 
that we must endeavor to induce proper emotional reac- 
tions, this pedagogical field is almost entirely unculti- 
vated. “The literature on this subject is scanty, almost 
to nonexistence. . . . Books intended to help the teacher 
of the young child or even of the adolescent have hardly 
yet been produced by the educationists of any land.” > 
“The very good reason why we do not specifically provide 
for the education of human feelings and emotions in our 
general scheme of education is that we have no sufficient 
understanding of how to accomplish this desirable 
training.” ® 
We have probably not yet listed emotions. We do not 
know the proper order or sequence of their appearance, 
but this problem is primarily one for the psychologist. 
How new this educational process is, compared to its 
future potentialities, may be noted from the fact that 
the emotional life is probably not the only phase which 
the school now overlooks in its exclusive devotion to in- 
tellectual development. The significance of maturity as 
a factor in education has received but slight attention. 
And yet maturity may condition a response as surely as 
emotional development. The ability fully to think with 
the author and understand and enjoy in the full sense 
such novels as those of George Eliot and William Make- 
peace Thackeray must be based as surely on that unde-

fined group of traits that go under the name of maturity, 
as other responses depend on emotional reactions such 
as sympathy, loyalty, and affection. Our knowledge and 
our practice in this field, our ideas as to whether a child 
is “old enough” to read a particular thing, are very vague 
indeed, and we come to a point at which we see that if 
we are to abandon subject-matter mastery as a goal, and 
the mere implantation of a teacher’s prejudice as an 
ideal; if we are really to have education as a rounded de- 
velopment of all the faculties, it will be necessary to make ~ 
a more thorough study than has ever yet been made of — 
the child subject to training, and to adjust school work 
to the realities discovered by experimental psychology.   II. The Factor of Variability 
Basic to all of this discussion is the fact that people 
vary greatly in emotional capacity. We have learned to 
measure intelligence, and have in consequence discovered 
varying degrees of capacity. When we have learned to 
isolate and measure emotional capacity, to list the de- 
velopment of the emotions in some order of sequence and 
to measure their intensity and susceptibility of develop- 
ment, we shall discover the differences at various ages for 
the race as a whole, differences between individuals of the 
same sex and possibly between the sexes, and finally, a 
qualitative difference that will diagnose creative capacity. 
Educational procedure will have to take these differ- 
ences into consideration. Crude adjustments are easily 
predictable. There probably exists a definitely measur- 
able difference between a future Beethoven or Shakes- 
peare and the person whose furthest development will 
mean ability to enjoy the creations of these masters to
-P-A-G-E-347
  
ASPECTS OF CURRICULUM FORMULATION 331 
the full. A true social economy will indicate the early 
discovery and development of the creative mind. As 
we have not yet settled on any practice or established any 
accepted theory for such qualitative educational dif- 
ferentiation in the field in which discrimination is now 
possible, namely, general intelligence, the subject of emo- 
tional education may as well be discussed in common 
with the problem of qualitative differentiation on the 
basis of such measurements as are now available, a prob- 
lem to which we must now address ourselves. 
The problem of differentiated education outlined — 
The time for simultaneous instruction on a pari-passu 
basis is well passed. That regrouping on the basis of 
variation in endowment must be effected was pointed out 
in a preceding chapter. The question before us here is 
what shall be done with these regrouped children. Shall 
we give them the same type of instruction, or shall we 
vary the character of the work done? If the work is to 
be varied, on what principles is the differentiation to be 
effected? Certain facts are fundamental and must be 
restated. It is neither possible nor is it desirable to make 
complete allowance for difference in endowment by send- 
ing the more highly endowed group forward more rapidly. 
American conditions are such that (1) the child must 
be kept in elementary school for approximately six years, 
and (2) the elementary school must not make inroads on 
the secondary-school curriculum. It is well known if not 
formally and theoretically stated, that maturity is as es- 
sential as intellectual ability, if one is to avail himself to 
the full of the opportunities of higher education and of 
association with one’s fellows in the higher institutions. 
It will probably be agreed that no child should be sent
-P-A-G-E-348
  | 
332 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
to the secondary school before age twelve, but this prin- 
ciple would be defeated if the elementary school under- 
took to do a year or more of high-school work, and thus 
sent the child on to the college earlier by that amount 
of time. Again, the elementary school, relying as it does 
for its teaching personnel on the present teacher-training 
agencies, is not prepared to carry on secondary instruc- 
tion. We must then retain a similar time period for prac- 
tically all children, regardless of our improvement in 
methods of instruction and of the existence of variation 
in ability. Presumably it is a fixed habit in America to 
send children to school at age six and we are to keep them 
until age twelve, during which period we must not tres- 
pass and indeed cannot trespass on the high-school cur- 
riculum. 
The objective goals set, too, in the most general way, 
remain the same. The most gifted child as well as the 
dullest is being trained for health, leisure, civic and social 
participation; and in terms of specific future career, dif- 
ferentiation of goal ought not to begin before age twelve. 
The most brilliant children are not necessarily so mature 
prior to age twelve as to be able to make their decisions. 
Experiment essential—_What then are we to do with 
the more highly endowed group? What use are we to 
make of the reclassification and differentiation of the two 
groups? The old assumptions have gone. We cannot 
content ourselves any longer with special promotions 
or so-called enrichment of the curriculum. We are 
frankly in a field where experimenting is very greatly 
needed. What we are to do with the child ought to de- 
pend on a most careful observation and study of this par- 
ticular type who can now be so easily isolated, segregated, 
and grouped for that purpose.
-P-A-G-E-349
ASPECTS OF CURRICULUM FORMULATION 333 
The distinction which is now being made by the mental 
test, which enables us to realize existing differences be- 
tween children, is quantitative. The numerical differ- 
ence in intelligence quotient between I.Q. 90 and I.Q. 120 
is a quantitative distinction. It indicates that these chil- 
dren differ in potential ability to do work. It is impor- 
tant to note that the numerical index of intelligence 
- quotient gives no qualitative clue to the child. This point 
can be made clear when we realize that a group of chil- 
dren selected for I.Q. all of whom are, let us say, of 115 
IQ. are not necessarily alike. When we get a group of 
children within a very narrow range of I.Q. we get a 
homogeneous group from one point of view, a quantita- 
tive one, but qualitatively these children differ from one 
another in ways that we are as yet unable to distinguish. 
In emotional capacity, in the various factors that go to 
make up character, as for example, perseverance, 
temperament, etc., these children differ in a way that we 
are unable to measure and describe. 
One can perhaps visualize the difference between the 
qualitative and quantitative distinctions by picturing 
a defined goal to be attained and ways in which the at- 
tainments might differ. If one thinks of a number of 
children starting out physically to reach a certain point, 
some of whom get there and some of whom drop out at 
different points of the stretch toward the goal, we have a 
visual image of quantitative differentiation. The child 
of 70 1.Q. starting out with a child of 125 I.Q. toward the 
distant goal of college graduation, probably stops before 
the point marked eighth grade. The better endowed 
child stops at some point between the eighth grade and 
second year, high school, and so the road is strewn with 
contestants until we reach the point of college graduation
-P-A-G-E-350
Oe re ee RL IE eee PE arene Oey HER See ey 
334 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
where we find the child of 125 I.Q. who not only started 
but finished the race. This is quantitative differentia- 
tion. 
On the other hand, we may picture a number of per- 
sons as reaching a named goal, but performing quite dif- 
ferently. Iago’s rdle may be memorized and acted by a 
high-school sophomore in a class play, or it may be 
memorized and presented by Edwin Booth. In this case 
there is no quantitative differentiation. In each in- 
stance, quantitatively, the goal has been attained. The 
differentiation is purely qualitative, and so long as we 
avail ourselves of our ability to differentiate between chil- 
dren for the purpose of making mere quantitative 
distinction, we are wasting almost entirely the school op- 
portunity presented by means of classification and group- 
ing on scientific lines. It is inevitably true that well en- 
dowed children differ from others qualitatively as well as 
quantitatively, but until we have probed for, discovered, 
and utilized the qualitative differentiation we are not 
making full use of our opportunity and developing these 
children to their highest possible capacity. 
It must be that a segregated group of highly endowed 
children is as capable of vastly richer emotional life as it 
is known to be of vastly greater intellectual life and de- 
velopment. It must be that this group contains the po- 
tential contributions to our civilization—the great 
creative minds of the future. So long as we fail to avail 
ourselves of the opportunities to discover and develop 
these great human resources we are committing most un- 
pardonable waste. So great has been the waste of human 
material hitherto by virtue of the failure to distinguish 
and develop outstanding ability, that it is probably im-
-P-A-G-E-351
ASPECTS OF CURRICULUM FORMULATION 335 
possible to forecast what vast changes in human life 
would be made by full development of this spiritual ma- 
terial. Highly endowed children do not do the same sort 
of thing as children of average intelligence more quickly 
and sooner, they do it differently. 
Basic social reasons for special need in America.—For 
a number of important reasons, this experiment and 
effort to conserve creative ability is more essential to-day 
than ever before in human history and more essential in 
America than almost anywhere else in the world. 
An economic society which increasingly standardizes 
not only processes of manufacture, but the very routine 
of daily life; a society which, by virtue of organization 
and concentration, abolishes the individuality and varia- 
tion of geographic divisions and makes the man on the 
Pacific slope attend the same movie as the one on the 
Atlantic seaboard, wearing the same national brand of 
clothes, smoking the same cigar, basing his opinion on the 
same syndicated news, purchasing his cheaper articles in 
the same red front five-and-ten-cent store, tends to create 
a uniformity in which the sort of accidental variation on 
the spiritual level that gives genius a chance, becomes 
decreasingly possible. “Quantity production of qualita- 
tively standardized” goods has some virtues, but it tends 
increasingly to make odd that deviation from type which 
holds promise. Life is becoming depressingly automa- 
tized. “The placement division of the Chicago high 
schools is at an increasing loss to fill the calls for dicta- 
phonists as against stenographers, for comptometrists, 
rather than bookkeepers, for machine operators of all 
kinds, for mimeographers and stencilers, filers and ad- 
dressographers. Half a dozen office technologists in 
 
-P-A-G-E-352
  336 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
commerce and administration can nowadays direct the 
office staff of an entire railroad.” 7 
These conditions are attributable to the age we live 
in, and therefore effective everywhere. But we in 
America face a special danger inherent in the very virtues 
of our social philosophy. We have done away with the 
idea of caste in education. We maintain one type of 
school only, a school for all. But the European caste 
and class system, cruel though it may be and unjustifi- 
able from a social and ethical point of view, is neverthe- 
less selective. Doubtless it excludes many children po- 
tentially capable of development on the higher levels, 
possibly it lets through a very small percentage who on 
rigorous bases of selection untinged by favoritism should 
be excluded. But, in a rough way, it trains a select group 
for leadership. It is more or less a conscious social de- 
vice for perpetuating the best in social institutions and 
for continuing their development. The very desire and 
ability to enroll a child in the German gymnasium, 
French lycée or English public school, is an indication 
of probable capacity in the hereditary line, a capacity 
which placed the family in a favorable social position. 
Our unitary school system, on the other hand, holds 
within itself a grave danger of mediocrity. The rather 
sudden undertaking which we have witnessed in America, 
to provide schooling for vast masses of children, requir- 
ing rapid adjustment of equipment, curriculum, peda- 
gogical theory and, most unfortunate of all, low standards 
of teaching personnel, has given us a system which, while 
highly creditable for the education of the average child, 
ue Stolberg, “Vocational Guidance.” The Nation, Vol. CXIV, 
p. 717.
-P-A-G-E-353
  ASPECTS OF CURRICULUM FORMULATION 337 
is a very poor place for the education of the highly en- 
dowed child. It is stating the simple truth to say that 
the educator who is asked for advice by the parent of 
a child of, let us say, I.Q. 180, is bound in honor to reply 
that there are no facilities public or private for the edu- 
cation of such children. 
Yet the social welfare from every point of view, eco- 
nomic as well as spiritual, demands that their develop- 
ment be especially provided for. Some of the institutions 
of aristocratic society which are least to our taste—such, 
for example, as the habit of patronizing the arts practised 
by certain wealthy and noble families by means of main- 
taining and subsidizing great artists—formerly functioned 
in Europe to achieve what we as a society have left un- 
done. We are not interested in seeing the establishment 
of private patrons. But a democracy cannot afford to 
let the potential contributors to its social and spiritual 
resources go undiscovered and undeveloped. Our society 
‘must devise ways and means of conserving its resources in 
human potentialities. Complacent mediocrity is a 
dangerous atmosphere for the future artists. Not only 
are we not in the habit as a society of rewarding creative 
ability in the field of art; we are even in danger of show- 
ing some contempt for non-highly remunerative 
occupations. 
The one-type school has been outgrown.—This, then, 
is the next great problem of the American public school 
as a conscious agency of the democracy. We must de- 
liberately, consciously select children for education in a 
special system of schools. This is not inconsistent with 
the principles of a democratic society. Where every child 
is given the same opportunity and the selecting method
-P-A-G-E-354
338 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
operates impersonally, the division is made not by the 
school, but by the operation of nature—a division not 
susceptible of influence by social philosophy.® 
We need, then, frankly, a system of schools in the place 
of the single school. We need, not clumsy adjustments 
to the present system, not classes, not special promotions, 
| not “enriched curricula,” but several types of schools dif- 
| ferentiating among children from the very day of their 
entrance on the basis of an ever improving set of measure- 
ments and criteria. 
| Tentative principles for the special education of the 
, highly endowed.—It has already been stated that exact 
procedure in the school for the highly endowed should 
| be left to determination by experiment. It is too late 
a day in the history of scientific education in America 
to theorize before we have worked with the human mate- 
rial and really determined its capacity. Nevertheless, 
such an experiment would begin with some hypothesis. 
The very reason for establishing the school holds within 
itself some implications which may be noted. In that 
sense we may say that it is possible to make a beginning 
in a basic theory for the education of highly endowed 
children. 
Although the special school for the highly endowed 
must adhere to certain principles laid down for elemen- 
tary schools in general, it is obvious enough that certain 
qualitative intensifications can be carried on. In other 
words, a school for specially endowed children would take 
a different attitude toward, and do a great deal more with

  ASPECTS OF CURRICULUM FORMULATION 339 
such subjects as music, drawing, dramatics, dancing, and 
nature study than is done in the typical school. No one 
knows to-day what may be done with children of this 
type if proper equipment, personnel, and freedom to ex- 
periment be permitted. Probably one specially stressed 
fundamental difference would be emotional development. 
Again, with the time available because of the rapidity 
with which these children learn standard subjects, a 
speaking knowledge of one or two languages might be 
given them without in any way interfering with the gen- 
eral high-school work. A school of this type ought to 
assist in determining how early children can and ought 
to begin school work, how rapidly they can be carried 
through the old curriculum, and how potential genius 
should be educated. 
In the first place, we assume that the highly endowed 
group is the group that contains, largely, the potential 
leadership of which we expect to be most proud. Pre- 
sumably this means leadership of every kind, in the arts 
as well as in citizenship and vocation, although the re- 
lation of emotional giftedness to general intelligence is 
by no means established. From this group, then, we 
shall expect originality. For this group, then, outlets 
for originality and creativeness should be especially pro- 
vided. This is the one group in whose training the theory 
of education as transmission should play the smallest 
réle. Environment and instruction should be deliber- 
ately organized to discover and foster deviation from 
accepted ways, originality of attack, the creative impulse. 
The inherent conserving tendency, over-emphasizing the 
status quo, has its particular dangers in the education of 
these children. For every Christopher Columbus and
-P-A-G-E-356
  340 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Robert Fulton there must be equally imaginative but 
less robust spirits who do not persist against odds. For 
these opportunity should be provided in the new school.** 
Again, there must be a willingness to release our grasp 
on accepted school methods. Undoubtedly a school for 
the most highly endowed will require a particularly 
picked personnel. Every intelligent observer of our 
schools has at some time or other had the chagrin of 
visiting a class in which the only advantage of the teacher 
over some of her pupils was that of maturity and the 
power of the law. There is a percentage of children in 
every class qualitatively superior to the teacher. If they 
are quite young, the teacher may have a higher mental 
age, but the children have the higher I.Q. All children re- 
quire good and intelligent teachers. The standards must 
continue to rise. But the most highly endowed children 
particularly need and must have the very finest teachers 
available. 
Furthermore, we cannot establish a new school and use 
the old material and equipment. Text-books, for ex- 
ample, will have to be written anew for this group. It 
is patent, and all observant teachers know, that the 
primer, adjusted to the average capacity, interest, and 
maturity of six-year-old children, frequently seems 
ludicrous to the brightest portion of the class. Differen- 
tiation does not mean the same thing at an earlier age or 
at a more rapid rate; it means qualitatively different pro- 
cedure. The new school, on the basis of experiment, will 
* The two following books interestingly describe pedagogical begin- 
nings toward this end but, oddly enough, on the apparent assumption 
that the new procedure is applicable to the entire school population:

(A Symposium) (Dutton, 1922).

establish new texts, new materials, new groupings from 
the point of view of homogeneity, new methods, new 
standards of achievement, a new curriculum. It will, for 
the first time in history, begin the education of youth in 
terms of real potentiality. The prime requisite of the ex- 
periment is freedom from traditional practice and from 
preconception. 
The great problem of the school, then, the problem 
that can be studied carefully only by experimenting, and 
that cannot be covered by pure theorizing, is to discover 
the qualitative attributes of the group that lead the world 
and create its wealth, material as well as spiritual, and 
to save all possible members of this group and develop 
all fine qualities of the members discovered. 
In view of the comparative novelty and fundamentally 
revolutionary character of this suggestion for frankly 
differentiated education, it is interesting to cite the 
opinion of a large-city school principal who has been 
studying the problem of the gifted child at close range:® 
“T think the ideal scheme,” he says, “would be to have a 
sufficient number of supernormal pupils to constitute a 
class by themselves and then to give them a broader and 
richer course and also take them over it more rapidly. 
This can be done in a very large school or in groups of 
schools aggregating 3000 or 4000 pupils. Three thou- 
sand pupils ought to furnish sufficient exceptionally bright 
children to make a good-sized class in each grade. These 
ought to be segregated, beginning about the third grade 
and kept in a separate class throughout the grades and

the high school. We are doing this for the subnormal 
type; why not for the superior?” 
Present status of education of gifted children.— 
“There is little evidence of any attempt to determine 
the special aptitudes and gifts of strong students and 
to provide them with special training in these fields,” 1° 
says one student, reporting an investigation which in- 
cluded every city in the United States having a pop- 
ulation of 8000 or more. Professor Freeman 1! reporting 
a similar investigation during the school year of 
1919-20 which covered cities of a population in excess 
of 25,000 does not refer to any experiment as com- 
plete in character as the one here suggested. He quite 
correctly concludes that “the organization of the work, 
particularly the adaptation of the curriculum to the 
bright pupils, is in a stage of great uncertainty.” It may 
be said in a general way that there is not going on at the 
present time any important general experiment along the 
lines outlined in this chapter.’? 
The most important thing now being done to meet 
the situation under discussion, consists of adjustments 
by skipping grades—a quantitative attitude. Even if 
this skipping were not awkward and unusable beyond 
certain limits because of age, it is fundamentally 
insignificant because it confines itself to speed along the 
old thin line of the curriculum, although the year or two

saved is of definite value and preferable to no adjustment 
whatever. The discussion of enriching the curriculum 
when analyzed resolves itself into doing more work, 
broader work in the same subjects that the regular class 
takes up. Occasionally it means the earlier beginning of 
secondary subjects. None of this is, however, funda- 
mental. The great problem involved is to learn how to 
develop these children for society to their utmost ca- 
pacity, and we cannot do this by stretching the present 
school. We must strike out experimentally to discover 
what we should do and how and when we should do it.1” 
An experiment of this type ought incidentally to yield 
information as to the basis for the inevitable reorganiza- 
tion of our system. In terms of mental age it should 
yield information useful for all types of children as to 
time for beginning and best method to be used in the 
standard subjects of the curriculum. It ought to point 
the way to a necessary reorganization of high school and 
college to receive the children of reorganized schools. 
In itself it ought to indicate to the educational world 
what the gifted child is capable of, what promise there 
is, and how important it is to save every single child of 
high endowment. If this group of children contains, as 
it probably does, the great bulk of the potentially crea- 
tive minds, then this experiment must devote itself to 
learning means of discovering and developing special 
aptitudes. At the present time we have no means of 
scientific qualitative differentiation, within the group pre- 
sumably homogeneous on the basis of I.Q. 
¥ “The working out of a differentiated course of study, as regards both 
content and method,” says Professor Terman (Intelligence Tests 
and School Reorganization, World Book Co., 1922), “is one of the most 
urgent needs in education today.”

A corollary in social terms.—Finally, the retention of 
the gifted child for the maximum period necessary for 
his development will have to be considered as a social 
problem. Logical uniformity of system and organization 
are almost always at variance with the real facts of life. 
Whereas these systems are smooth, regular, and symmetri- 
cal, life itself is varied, complex, and unfavorable to com- 
plete systematization. Perfect logic of organization ought 
always to be under suspicion. So it is with the com- 
pulsory school laws. They have been enacted to operate 
uniformly in the case of all children, but this logic is at 
variance with reality. The fact of the matter is that 
when a child has reached a point beyond which he can 
no longer benefit by school work, his retention there rep- 
resents a social waste and extravagance. Not only does 
the State waste on his account equipment and teachers’ 
salaries; it loses in addition the social production in which 
he might be well engaged. So far as he is concerned, the 
requisite legal condition is not one that arbitrarily com- 
pels him to stay in school until he attains a fixed chosen 
age but rather one which protects him from improper ex- 
ploitation in the world of work. This point becomes all 
the more important in view of the current tendency to 
extend the compulsory age to eighteen. 
On this same reasoning, the fixed uniform compulsory 
age law may operate to draw from the schools children 
whose remaining under instruction might mean every- 
thing not only for themselves personally, but for the com- 
munity at large. Their withdrawal might be expensive, 
indeed, as expensive as the retention of the others, and 
their addition to social production of insignificant value 
compared to their potential contribution lost by failure 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
  ASPECTS OF CURRICULUM FORMULATION 345 
fully to develop their abilities. Such children ought to be 
kept in school by compulsion and, indeed, subsidized 
where it is found that their parents are financially un- 
able to maintain them. 
The impracticability of complete uniformity of com- 
pulsory education legislation has been referred to in our 
discussion of deaf children, where it was shown that such 
children ordinarily require more time for the attainment 
of the same ends than hearing children. Here again we 
note the impracticability of such uniform legislation. 
The time has come when the schools will have to conform 
to realities rather than to logic. They will abandon arbi- 
trary divisions such as grades based on years rather 
than accomplishment. They will abandon uniformity of 
grouping and method. They will become more complex 
and to that extent more effective. 
School provision for poorly endowed children.—The 
implications of variability and the demand for special 
schools to be provided for the highly endowed, point as 
clearly to a special school for those of very low intelli- 
gence. The public school has heretofore necessarily been 
adjusted to the average child. In any large class of 
unselected children, it will be found that the teacher aims 
toward the center or meridian child. Children of less than 
average ability have in recent years received a great deal 
of attention. This work, while of the greatest importance 
to the individual children involved, and, too, of social con- 
sequence in that it decreases the number of possible de- 
pendents, is of very little value compared to the promise 
of untapped resources involved in the study of the peda- 
gogy of gifted children. After all, the most that is to be 
expected of the subnormal child, the greatest achievable 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
  346 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
attainment, is and always will be less than average. The 
problem here is very largely one of method, in view of 
the inability of these children to hold their own with the 
average group. It is, too, a social problem of curriculum, 
tending to establish such specific attainable goals as will 
bring about a maximum of productiveness and self- 
support and, consequently, a minimum social burden. 
This problem will not be discussed in detail here for the 
reason that experimentation toward its solution has been 
going on for some years and a somewhat extensive litera- 
ture on the subject is available. The statement should 
be made, however, that the writer favors, as fundamental 
for educational adjustment to modern scientific informa- 
tion and democratic social ideals, the establishment of a — 
system of three schools, one that will educate two-thirds 
or more of the population, one that will train the very 
dull, and one that will undertake the development of the 
very highly endowed. The implications should be faced 
frankly. Varying provisions should be arranged in ac- 
cordance with the varying types. The compulsory edu- 
cation law, for example, need perhaps not be as long 
for the lowest type as for the population at large. This 
type, too, may during the period of education require 
facilities and instruction in the amenities of daily life in 
our type of society such as, in the case of the other groups, 
are ordinarily cared for in the home. 
Summary 
The achievement by the school of formulated curricu- 
lum goals is conditioned by psychological factors such as 
maturity, intelligence, emotion, and, in addition, vari- 
ability in every distinguishable characteristic. In this
-P-A-G-E-363
  ASPECTS OF CURRICULUM FORMULATION 347 
chapter we have dealt with two of these conditioning 
factors; namely, the emotional life of the child as a 
hitherto neglected educational problem, and the proper 
adaptation to the known and measurable variation in 
general intelligence. 
While it must be conceded that the curriculum should 
be as rounded as human nature and provide for complete 
development, including feeling as well as acting and 
thinking, the fact is that the schools have so far made 
no provision and developed no technic for emotional de- 
velopment of a kind that will introduce the child to the 
cultural inheritance of the race. The cultural life of the 
American people is in no sense commensurate with the 
possibilities. 
Two important reasons may be mentioned for this 
failure of the school. In preceding social organization 
in which formal education has functioned, a social organi- 
zation fundamentally aristocratic, the introduction to the 
arts was informally cared for in the home. For the 
masses, it did not exist. For the aristocratic classes it was 
_ the very nature of the environment that gave them their 
introduction to the arts. The secondary school, the tra- 
ditional school in which the children of the caste were 
educated, did not need to concern itself with the arts. 
The elementary school, primarily intended for the 
masses, concerned itself at first only with utilitarian 
knowledge and skills. When it did add drawing, music, 
and literature, it did not at the same time develop a new 
technic calculated to train for enjoyment. It treated the 
new subjects in the old ways. It worked for knowledge 
and skills. It paid no attention to emotions. It intel- 
lectualized material which, while requiring basic knowl- 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
348 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
edge and technic, should appeal primarily to the emo- 
tions. 
But if the educative process is to result in effecting 
a difference in conduct, the school, so far as concerns the 
arts, will have to discover a procedure that affects the 
child’s emotions. Emotional and intellectual ends are 
not achievable in the same manner. It will therefore be 
essential to divide all educational goals into two groups, 
those primarily intellectual and those primarily emo- 
tional, and to establish a procedure for each. Toward 
the establishment of a pedagogy of the emotions, hardly 
any work has as yet been done by either the psychologist 
or the teacher. 
When we have learned to isolate and measure intensity 
of emotional: capacity we shall doubtless find a great de- 
gree of variability, such as we have already discovered 
in the capacity which we now measure, namely, general 
intelligence. 
This brings up the important problem of educational 
differentiation. While it is conceded that differentiation 
is to be provided for, no universally agreed upon or satis- 
factory procedure has yet been adopted. Certain basic 
factors are not for the present modifiable and must, there- 
fore, be counted with; namely: 
We cannot make allowance for variation by mere dif- 
ference in the rate of progress over the same ground. 
All children must be kept in school for approximately 
six years. The elementary school must not invade the 
secondary-school curriculum. Again, in a general way, 
the objectives of education, such as health and vocation, 
must remain similar for all. 
The problem of differentiation in detail, then, must
-P-A-G-E-365
  ASPECTS OF CURRICULUM FORMULATION 349 
be left to experimentation. Certain basic facts may be 
noted in advance of such an experiment. We should 
establish, for differentiated education, actually differen- 
tiated schools. These schools will require a selected type 
of teacher, new text-books and other teaching material. 
They will, too, establish new curricula, a new method- 
ology, and new standards of achievement. 
Because of the modern tendency to standardize and, in 
a sense, automatize human endeavor, because of the dan- 
ger of mediocrity involved in the one-type school for the 
masses; because of our failure to maintain special facili- 
ties for the best endowed such as are, in a sense, main- 
tained abroad by the double system of schools; because, 
finally, all these causes combine to rob us of our cultural 
inheritance and of the creative possibilities of our best 
minds, this experiment is especially essential to-day. It 
may be said, in general, that no such experiment is now 
going on. 
Finally, we note that if the development of the highly 
endowed is important, means must be found for holding 
them in school for such length of time as is demanded by 
this development. Uniform compulsory school require- 
ments are not useful. In the case of the very dull, they 
may eventually be found to cover too long a period. In 
the case of most highly endowed, the period is probably 
in certain instances too short. The latter should be 
retained in school even where such retention is not 
possible without some subsidy to parents whose economic 
status does not permit them to furnish the child the 
requisite leisure and support during the lengthened period 
of education. 
On the basis of the discussion in this chapter, special

school facilities are as essential for the unusually dull 
as for the most highly endowed. A detailed discussion 
of this subject is, however, not undertaken, for an ample 
bibliography on the subject is available. 
| Problems 
This chapter develops two lines of theoretical discus- 
sion along which educational investigation is essential. 
1. Outline procedure for a practical experiment in 
emotional education involving: 
a. A study of the sequential appearance of the emo- 
tions in children. 
b. A tabulation of those emotions which it is highly 
desirable to develop, and of those which pre- 
sumably have no social or individual values 
to-day. 
c. A means of measuring variability or intensity of 
emotion. 
d. The relation of emotional development to physi- 
ological and to mental age, tending to establish 
the significance and measurability of maturity. 
e. Pedagogical procedure tending to develop the 
emotions along the avenues of the several arts. 
2. Prepare a tentative curriculum and program for 
the education of highly endowed children.

CHAPTER XV 
METHOD, MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT 
The teacher in charge of a group of children faces a 
problem that has two phases: first, the method of teach- 
ing, and second: the business of management. About 
each of these phases there has gathered an accumulation 
of experience, tested at many points by experiment and 
theory. One can understand present practice in each in- 
stance only in the light of the historical development of 
that practice. 
I. Management 
Management as a phase of teaching comes to the fore 
with simultaneous instruction, and its problems and their 
solution are therefore coincident with the origin of that 
form of instruction. The Brethren of the Christian 
Schools organized by Jean Baptiste de la Salle in 1684 
are to be credited with the first practical establishment 
of the method of class or group instruction. It is to the 
genius of La Salle that we owe our first manuals pre- 
scribing a routine for the establishment, conduct, and 
organization of schools. It is interesting to note, too, 
that it is only after the establishment of such accumu- 
lated information that teacher-training can begin. The 
Christian Brothers were the first teachers who were sub- 
jected to a course of professional training that dealt with 
353
-P-A-G-E-370
    
354 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
method and management rather than, or as well as, with 
the actual content of instruction. 
In English-speaking countries the beginning of accumu- 
lated experience and knowledge regarding management 
is found in the work of Andrew Bell and Joseph Lan- 
caster, who began their remarkable work in the year 
1800, and who, relying, as they did, on very immature 
assistants, established in great detail a system of me- 
chanics and of routine school procedure. It is to them, 
too, that we are indebted for the first serious considera- 
tion of problems of classification of children for purposes 
of instruction. 
While progress has undoubtedly been made in the last 
century in class management, and the schools of to-day 
do not resemble either those of the Christian Brothers 
or those established under the monitorial system, it is 
safe to say that this fact is due rather to the continuous 
improvement in personnel than to any information that 
may be seriously considered as scientific. Professor Bag- 
ley and others * have carefully and very usefully thought 
out the problems involved in management and offered 
suggestions which tend to the elimination of waste. But 
of rigorous and unalterable standards there are almost 
on experience than on science. In view of the large num- 
ber of books which serve excellently to detail that ex- 
perience, it does not seem proper to repeat it here. 
It must be noted, however, that management is no 
more firmly established and settled in our practice than 
are other phases of conduct in the elementary school; 
it is in flux. The movement for socialization which is te

be discussed in a later section, and such complete reversal 
of established procedure as is described by Professor 
Meriam under the subject of observation, or by Mrs. 
Johnston in her school in Fairhope, by Miss Parkhurst 
in her school at Dalton, Massachusetts, or as is implied in 
the project method, or the school excursion as a method 
of instruction, indicate that there are as yet no finalities 
in this field, subject as management must be to ideas of 
classification, curriculum, and methods, none of which 
are firmly or finally established. 
It ought to be noted, too, that one great scientific field 
of potential helpfulness in this matter has not yet made 
its contribution; namely, the field of group psychology. 
It was indicated in a former chapter that eventually we 
shall have to learn in part from the students of social, or 
group, psychology what the optimum number of children 
in the class should be for any given age or subject. In 
illustration of this point we may note that F. H. Hayward, 
a student of method in one particular field, holds that 
“for some subjects large classes are an advantage inas- 
much as, in small classes, enthusiasm is not easy to work 
up.” So, too, we shall have to learn from the science of 
psychology exactly what differences there are between 
teaching an individual by himself and teaching him in a 
group. Some things, of course, every one knows: The 
power of emulation and rivalry as well as some other 
instincts have been and are constantly being exploited 
by teachers, not always entirely for the child’s best in- 
terests. But if class instruction is worth while; if it is 
really different from merely teaching an individual in 
the presence of a group, we shall have to accumulate exact 
information regarding these differences as well as regard-
-P-A-G-E-372
  356 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
ing those points which are worth developing, and others 
which one must avoid. 
In the field of management proper, it is perhaps not 
too much to expect that from studies of group psychology 
at various maturity levels and in conjunction with in- 
telligence and emotional status, we shall secure norms 
of conduct that shall be real and attainable rather than 
arbitrary. and based on ideals set by adults for children. 
The word “discipline” has a dangerous sound. It smacks 
of standards imposed from above. It has associations 
broader than education. e learned from Rousseau long 
ago that true education requires that we deal with the 
child on his level, not on ours; that childhood is a phase 
of living and not a mimic adulthood. While we have 
made great advances in that direction, and to-day refer 
to a person who is too arbitrary in his demands as one 
‘Svho does not understand children,” the phrase “class- 
room control” still harks back to older and more readily 
attainable ideals. It is possible that the adult’s idea of 
how children should conduct themselves will some day 
be replaced by objectively determined norms of what is 
attainable consistently with their best interest. 
The movement for socialization which has been re- 
ferred to, has as one of its underlying assumptions the 
fact that in view of the student’s future citizenship in a 
self-governing democratic community, Cthe classroom 
ought to be as little autocratic and as much democratic 
as possible in order to train students in self-control, co- 
operation, participation, and other of the qualities de- 
sirable in self-governing communities. It is intended by 
this procedure to produce an important by-product of 
all instruction, regardless of subject. Alluring as the
-P-A-G-E-373
METHOD, MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT 357 
theory sounds, it is necessary to be on one’s guard against 
its enticement. The mere statement of these things does 
not make them true. The fact remains forever that there 
is a difference between children and adults; that it is the 
business of adults to carry on the work of nurture until 
children shall be placed on a self-sustaining basis, and the 
only safe guidance to ideal class organization will come 
from an exact study of the factors of group psychology 
which operate at varying ages. 
II. Method 
By far the more important of the two phases above 
referred to, is that of method. In the chapter on curricu- 
lum the statement was made that there have been 
noted thinkers in the field of elementary education, 
_ and that their contributions center about method rather 
than curriculum content. There is no phase of elemen- 
tary education in which it is more essential to bear in 
mind the historic background and the deep roots of cur- 
rent practice than in this field of method. Almost every 
current suggestion and every experiment now being car- 
ried on has an ancestry and dates back to a source of 
prior inspiration. Many a suggestion in current school 
practice which looks unfeasible and like a passing fad 
may be found in the end to be the result of a continuous 
process of thought running for a century or more, and 
in that way be shown to have a stable basis. While it is 
true that many innovations now being tried out will not 
prevail in the end, and while it is true that many ideas in 
themselves excellent are being carried to impracticable 
extremes, which will eventually have to be curbed, it is a 
fine thing to remember that in the field of method in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-374
358 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
elementary school there has run a sound current of 
thought dating back a great number of years, which has 
been continuous in progress, and which is becoming richer 
and more fruitful decade by decade. Almost all of our 
present practice has deep and sound roots. 
While it is necessary, therefore, to glance backward, | 
it is not within the scope of the present work ‘to give a 
detailed historic résumé, if only for the reason that the 
historic development to be referred to has already been 
so well described, as the reader may readily gather from 
the bibliography at the end of this chapter. The follow- 
ing brief paragraphs must be regarded as interpretative 
rather than historical: 
Rousseau.—At the beginning of all current thought 
and practice, particularly within the field of method is 
found the work of Jean Jacques Rousseau. “In Rous- 
seau’s teachings, notwithstanding their extravagance,” 
says Professor Monroe,” “is to be found the truth upon 
which all educational development of the nineteenth cen- 
tury is based. . . . He became the inspiration of those 
educational reformers who reduced his vagaries to prac- 
ticable procedure. He was the forerunner of many who, 
all unconscious of their indebtedness to the despised revo- 
lutionist, have followed in the trails he blazed through 
the forest, until now they have become the broad high- 
way of common travel.” 
In an even more direct and concrete manner, Professor 
Parker? lists fourteen main points in Rousseau’s phil- 
osophy of education and notes after each proposition the

millan, 1914.)

Education, p. 206. (Ginn, 1912.)
-P-A-G-E-375
  METHOD, MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT 359 
character of its later development by educational think- 
ers, and its current phase. 
Briefly then, what was Rousseau’s contribution? It 
may be said that Rousseau was the first of the contem- 
poraries. If the term “modern” is to be stretched so far 
as to refer back to the period immediately following the 
Middle Ages, then it may be said that Rousseau was the 
first of the men of to-day. He was a severe critic of 
practice in his day in many fields, political, religious, 
social, and educational. Our concern is with his educa- 
tional criticism. 
(The first and most important thing to say is that Rous- 
seau discovered childhood. In all the ages preceding 
Rousseau, childhood was looked upon as a period of prep- 
aration for future living. It was the business of adults 
to make the child into their own image. The best brought 
up children were miniature adults. Childhood per se had 
no rights. Its impulses and tendencies, such as the de- 
sire to play and the dislike for sedentary formal school 
work, were unuseful and non-social tendencies that must 
be eradicated. Rousseau was the liberator of childhood. 
It was he who formulated the now entirely obvious theory 
that childhood is not a preparation for, but a phase of 
living, and that the child should, therefore, not be de- 
prived of youth in order that he may be prepared to live 
later on, but should be given the opportunity to live to- 
day. If the child be given an opportunity to live to-day, 
the future, thought Rousseau, would take care of itself. 
The child was equipped to develop, to grow, to become, 
and education should assist him in this natural develop- 
ment rather than attempt to make him over. The child’s 
natural impulses are good, not bad, useful, not useless,
-P-A-G-E-376
  360 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
and therefore should be taken advantage of and developed 
for his use, not eradicated. 
As a logical consequence of this basic principle, Rous- 
seau vehemently objected to formalism, conventionality, 
artificial behavior, mimicry, mere verbiage in education, 
mere memorizing, and particularly the repression of the 
esthetic emotions; and the attempt to repress and re- 
model children, making them into miniature adults. He 
stood for childhood as a phase of living. This involved 
providing children with activities appropriate to child- 
hood rather than adulthood. It involved treating the 
child as a child rather than attempting prematurely to 
make him take on the manners of an adult. The corol- 
lary following from this resulted in furnishing in school 
facilities for physical development, the development of 
sense perception—which seemed to Rousseau the natural 
method of education—provision for motor activities, and, 
most important of all, the doing away with premature 
memorizing of words. The preceding method of educa- 
tion had consisted largely of loading the memory with 
things beyond the child’s comprehension, on the theory 
that they would be useful later on. The image in the 
child’s mind back of this “knowledge” was verbal rather 
than real. The child might memorize a definition, for 
example, and satisfy his teacher with the uttering of 
‘words, and not know really the thing described. 
Rousseau contended for the education and development 
of natural interests and instincts as against the then 
current education which consisted of artificial effort. He 
believed that education was a natural process of develop- 
ment and not an artificial means of taking on arbitrarily 
the ways of grown-up life. He believed that education 
 
-P-A-G-E-377
  METHOD, MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT 361 
consisted of development and growth and not of accre- 
tion and external acquisition of information. He be- 
lieved that education should result in response to natural 
instincts and interests and not in response to external 
force represented by society and the school. 
“That education is a natural, not an artificial proc- 
ess,” to quote from Professor Monroe again,* “that it 
is a development from within, not an accretion from 
without; that it comes through the workings of natural 
instincts and interests and not through response to ex- 
ternal force; that it is an expansion of natural powers, 
not an acquisition of information; that it is life itself, 
not a preparation for a future state remote in interests 
and characteristics from the life of childhood—these 
ideas constitute the fundamental teaching of Rousseau. 
. . . To Rousseau belongs the honor of deriving his edu- 
cational theories from the nature of the child. . . . Here 
first education finds its purpose, its process; and its means 
wholly within the child life and the child experience. An 
appropriate development of childhood is the purpose of 
each particular stage of education; the child’s nature and 
the child’s growth are to determine the process; the 
child’s experience is to furnish the means.” 
Heinrich Pestalozzi—Pestalozzi is known as the 
thinker and practical school man who first subjected 
Rousseau’s theories to the test of practice. As was in- 
evitable, the discovery was made of some things that 
were not practical, and others that could be so developed 
and enlarged as to give them the appearance of new con- 
tributions. Pestalozzi adopted and acted on Rousseau’s

— 571. (Macmillan, 1914.)

    362 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
theory that education is fundamentally the organized de- 
velopment of the individual mentally, physically, and 
morally. He adopted the theory, further, that we become 
educated not by memorizing or being told things, but by 
doing them ourselves—by living, by experiencing, by 
contact. The best form of education, he thought, comes 
through experiences and activities initiated by spontane- 
ous desire. 
It will hardly be fruitful to dwell on Pestalozzi’s mis- 
takes. We have learned that it was not psychologically 
true, as he believed, that the best way to present things 
to the child is through the analysis of knowledge into its 
simplest elements, and by providing, therefore, a series 
of graded exercises leading from the simple to the com- 
plex. We no longer teach penmanship, reading, and 
arithmetic as Pestalozzi and his followers taught them. 
We do, however, firmly adhere to his ideas that educa- 
tion should come through perception and sense experience 
rather than through mere words. He put into practice 
Rousseau’s idea of sense impressions, and his belief that 
the child should get the real meaning of information 
rather than knowledge through verbal representation. 
He put into practice the theory of development through 
activities, experiences, and impressions, and on this basis 
he completely reorganized and gave a modern aspect to 
several subjects of the curriculum such as geography, 
drawing, and writing. He definitely began to “psycholo- 
gize” education by adapting processes to the capacity of 
the child, and initiated the theory that to know how to 
teach we must learn how the child develops and learns; 
and that we must organize our educational procedure in 
terms of the child’s educational development.

METHOD, MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT 363 
Johann Friedrich Herbart—Herbart developed the 
doctrine of interest and gave impetus to the reorganiza- 
tion of school procedure in terms of interest, using a 
hitherto undeveloped source for easing, simplifying, and 
increasing the rate of the educative process. He de- 
veloped the Greek idea of abiding, many-sided interests 
as the aim of instruction. It was he who first pointed out 
the method of apperception; namely, the use of present 
interests as a means of contact for beginning the learn- 
ing of new things. He developed a methodical organi- 
zation of the material of each subject for purposes of in- 
struction and believed in the use of a central core to the 
curriculum, which for his purpose consisted of literature 
and history. He believed, too, in a serial arrangement 
of the curriculum following the chronology of historical 
development, because of his belief that the individual 
recapitulates the history of the race. He gave much at- 
tention to the organization of the recitation, and or- 
ganized the formal procedure of the lesson into the 
logical but too formal “five steps,” i.e. preparation, pres- 
entation, comparison, generalization, application. 
Friedrich Froebel.—Froebel developed other phases of 
the Rousseau thought in his kindergarten. ‘“Self-ac- 
tivity,’ a real application of the doctrine of education 
through development; the use of handwork in education 
for the first time, careful devotion to nature study, repre- 
sent some of his contributions. Froebel showed in detail 
the way of making educational use of certain of the 
child’s natural instincts and impulses by developing me- 
thodically and in detail for educational purposes one of 
these; namely, the child’s desire to play. Much use has 
since been made of this theory, and much joy in school
-P-A-G-E-380
  364 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
life to-day is due to the fact that teachers have learned 
to do work through play. 
Finally, the very latest topic of educational discussion, 
namely, socialization, was first brought to the fore by 
Froebel. He saw clearly that a group of children in a 
class formed a social unit differing from each single indi- 
vidual. It was he then who began to lay stress on social 
participation and to make educational use of the social 
situation presented by the presence of a class. He de- 
veloped a technic for motor experiences in the form of 
drawing and games and for manual work in his beginning 
of kindergarten handwork. 
Method a problem of simultaneous instruction—We 
come now to a discussion of the problem of method to- 
day, a field fully discussed in the current literature of 
education and, therefore, to be dealt with summarily here. 
Method in American discussion to-day almost always 
means method of teaching a group. The teaching process 
as it applies to the single individual is referred to as the 
learning process, rather than as method, and forms one 
specific phase of the discussion of method. All current 
contributions involve a discussion of the teaching of the 
group. 
Indeed, modern methodology implies group instruction 
not merely because group instruction is the only form now 
carried on practically, but because modern method is in 
principle rooted in the very fact of the existence of the 
group in the teaching situation, a situation frequently 
utilized as one means toward the development of 
method, as, for example, the method of socialization, to 
be referred to later. 
Method may be looked upon as either general or special
-P-A-G-E-381
| 
METHOD, MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT 365 
from at least two points of view. From the point of view 
| of the subject-matter involved, general method comprises 
all those principles that tend toward the establishment 
of a general teaching technic, regardless of special sub- 
jects. In this sense, the special methods center around 
the technic developed in the teaching of special subjects, 
in many of which the history of special method dates 
all the way back to the work done by Pestalozzi in his 
schools. This is the sense in which the terms are 
ordinarily used. 
From the point of view of the child, on the other hand, 
general method may be taken as referring to the average 
or typical child; that group of the population that repre- 
sents well in excess of fifty per cent. of the total popula- 
tion. At either extreme there are undoubtedly children 
to whom no set of principles involved in any such discus- 
sions as project or motive would apply. At the lower end 
there are children whose mentality ranges below average, 
from very dull to feeble-minded. In the case of these 
children a complete new methodology must be worked 
out. Certain phases of habit formation which take care 
of themselves in the case of the normal child must be 
very carefully stressed in the development of these classes. 
On the other hand, initiative and the ability to generalize 
need not be emphasized. To a very considerable extent 
the methodology has been worked out and given a great 
deal of attention. 
But for the unusually well endowed, for the group 
that contains potential genius, it is entirely safe to say 
that no set of principles whatever, and very little formu- 
lated experience, now exist so far as their education is 
concerned. Special method, special equipment, special

texts, size of groups, length of time to acquire mastery 
of knowledge or skill, means of emotional development— 
all this is in the future, and still dependent on a great 
deal of careful, patient, and enduring experimentation.® 
Method and other fields of inquiry—The phase of 
education represented by method brings out clearly 
the elusiveness of the boundary lines between organized 
fields of activity and the basic reliance of one upon the 
other. The reliance of method upon the data to be pre- 
sented by psychology is obvious enough, and has long 
been recognized. The child’s development, the learning 
process, the variation of children, the meaning of educa- 
tion, the laws of memorizing, the psychology of interest, 
and many similar aspects are known definitely to con- 
tribute toward method. It is well to observe, however, 
that in every one of the instances mentioned, the contri- 
bution of psychology has been in the form of the study 
of the individual. On the other hand, frequent reference 
has been made in the course of this discussion to the 
fact that the principles of group psychology, as these 
apply to the situation presented by the classroom, have 
not yet been formulated. 
But psychology is, so far, practically the only field of 
research whose relation to method has been made clear. 
The boundary between method and the field of ethics, 
for example, is very rarely recognized. The school has 
availed itself freely of devices such as the giving of re- 
wards, artificial motivation, rivalry, and emulation for 
the purpose of achieving its own ends as conceived by 
adults. Are these devices ethical, and are they for the

  METHOD, MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT 367 
child’s best interest? Is it socially desirable to develop 
those traits that result from excessive competition? These 
questions still remain to be thought out and answered. 
The laws of group behavior still remain to be developed 
by psychology. The worthiness of many devices com- 
monly and traditionally employed in school procedure 
is still to be tested by students of ethics and morality. 
Finally, entering the field of sociology, it will be necessary 
for students of the group life as it expresses itself socially, 
politically, and in other ways, to criticize the procedure 
of the socialized recitation, and to outline characteristics 
to be developed because they are valuable, and others 
to be avoided because they are not. 
Intellect and emotion.—We must now revert to a pre- 
ceding discussion, necessarily dealt with in part in our 
consideration of curriculum objectives; namely, the de- 
velopment of emotional reactions, or, speaking more 
specifically in relation to the arts, the training for appre. 
ciation. If, as we saw in our discussion of the curriculum, 
the objectives are to be either primarily intellectual or 
primarily emotional, then method, too, must proceed 
along one of two paths. 
One of the curriculum objectives now regularly set 
down is that of the best use of leisure time—an objective 
that is to be attained through enjoyment of the best 
that the race has inherited, and to the child’s utmost 
capacity. But the school has heretofore not known any 
method of affecting the emotions even where it has dealt 
with the arts. It has intellectualized them. Crude use 
has indeed been made by the school of the emotions, as, 
for example, in many of the instances referred to in the 
preceding paragraph. Rivalry, emulation, desire for re~
-P-A-G-E-384
  368 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
ward, these are all emotional states induced for the pur- 
pose of achieving ends desired by the adult, but not 
necessarily useful to the child, as for example, the mastery 
of certain material. 
This use of the emotions merely to serve the ends of 
the teacher, or even, presumably, the ends of society, is 
not at all the type of emotional reaction here referred to. 
The great objective here is to do work that will result in 
enjoyment rather than knowledge. In terms of goal, 
method may result in one of two ways, either in knowl- 
edge or in appreciation. When we come to a discussion 
of the method of inducing emotional reactions such as 
the enjoyment of any particular art, we find that “the 
literature of this subject is scanty almost to non-exist- 
ence.” ®. . . Mr. Haywood makes a pioneer attempt on 
the basis of experiment to outline procedure in this field, 
and his work should be studied by the student whose 
interest is aroused. 
One fact stands out most clearly from this discussion; 
namely, that the time has arrived when the propriety 
of relying upon a text as the sole method of achieving 
an educational goal should be questioned. Poor though 
that method of instruction may be in a field whose ulti- 
mate goal is the acquisition of information—a method 
which is being replaced by the use of the project to 
be discussed in a later paragraph—it is obvious that 
no amount of mastery of opinions will ever induce 
emotional reactions. That is exactly the old method 
of instruction in this field, whereby the student of 
literature learned, by reading a history of that sub- 
ject, what others thought of certain great persons and

books. But here we come to the end of the useful- 
ness of that process. Here at last we come quite 
definitely from the books to the teacher; to a break with 
one too well established phase of American school pro- 
cedure. Books lack fire; they cannot work up excitement. 
Some phases of current discussion.—General method, 
in the accepted sense, of principles applicable to various 
subjects in dealing with the large group of the child popu- 
lation who center about the average, is undergoing some 
current discussion and reorganization, which may be 
briefly noted. The modern school, says Dr. Freeland,” 
is developing “a new methodology which works through 
the use of problems, projects, motives, and interests.” 
Leaving to the extensive literature on the subject, the 
discussion of problems, motives, and interests as aids 
in instruction, we shall note here the general tendency 
to reorganize school procedure and relations which goes 
by the name socialization, and the method of procedure 
referred to as the project. It has already been pointed 
out that, in effect, none of the proposals in the current 
discussion of method is really new. They are very largely 
a reémphasis and an enthusiastic application of old and 
well-known principles. 
Another warning may not be out of place. Teaching 
is fundamentally an art, not a routine. Good teaching 
involves self-expression and creative thinking on the part 
of the individual teacher, and the efficiency methods of 
the factory are not particularly applicable or desirable

millan, 1919.)

in the standardization of teaching. Yet it happens not 
infrequently that highly successful work on the part of 
an enthusiastic teacher or group of teachers in the ap- 
plication of some established principle is hailed as new 
“method,” and the tacit assumption is that the method 
should be extended. The “group psychology” of the 
American teaching personnel is such that few dare to re- 
sist these on-rushing waves of innovation, each in turn 
proclaimed as “revolutionary” and promising impossible 
results. 
Most teachers attempt to be up to date. But where 
the basic results were due to the teachers, not the method, 
the latter, standing alone, frequently fails to fulfil 
expectations. 
It is true that the best way to establish correct prin- 
ciples of procedure is to study the performance of suc- 
cessful practitioners and to generalize the principles. In 
that sense the “new” phases of method to be noted are 
important. On the other hand it may be recalled that 
we in America have already gone through the experience 
of seeing the deadly formalism and frozen procedure that 
follows the rapid acceptance of method as method, in 
the too rapid spread of Pestalozzian object-teaching and 
the Herbartian recitation. History has its lessons. Hav- 
ing gone through this phase of American educational 
development, we should be slow to deprive ourselves of 
the really vivifying values of the newer procedure by fore- 
ing its adoption too rapidly and on teachers who would 
necessarily adopt the form but not the spirit. Teaching 
is an art. Results are, in the long run, more important 
than procedure. 
Socializing school procedure.—The theory underlying 
the socialization of school procedure is, primarily, not
-P-A-G-E-387
METHOD, MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT 371 
so much a new contribution toward the better or more 
rapid achievement of standard curriculum objectives— 
although it furnishes motivation toward this end—as an 
attempt to secure, as a by-product of the regular work, 
habits, attitudes, and ideals of group activity suitable for 
the citizens of a democracy. Fundamentally the theory 
is this: the child under training is not to live for and by 
himself alone. It is necessary, therefore, that he receive 
the type of training that will be most useful to him as an 
adult codperating with, and participating in, group ac- 
tivities. This result, it is conceived, may be achieved 
incidentally through method used in carrying on the in- 
struction in the ordinary subjects of the curriculum. It 
is largely a matter of procedure in which the school and 
class situation are changed. In place of the traditional 
situation in which the teacher assumes the right of com- 
plete dictation and of making all decisions, and in which 
the chief virtue expected of the child is obedience, a demo- 
cratic atmosphere is established and the children are 
permitted and, indeed, invited to assist as far as their 
capacity permits, not only in the making of decisions, but 
in the actual taking over of management and control. 
It should, of course, remain basic in education that it 
is the business of adults to rear children and any abdica- 
tion of this obligation merely results in futility and chaos. 
Socialization at its best is well within the control of this 
responsibility for education. The goals to be achieved 
are much clearer to the teacher than to the pupils, whose 
attention, indeed, may well be confined to the immediate 
‘situation. Within these limits, the idea of socialization 
‘surely promises beneficial results. \ 
The common defects of the traditional procedure to be    
-P-A-G-E-388
  372 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
remedied by socialization, as pointed out by proponents 
of the movement, are that the teacher has heretofore 
failed to avail himself of the fact of the existence of the 
group, and has simply taught each individual in turn 
in the presence of the group. There has been a tendency 
for a few to monopolize the activities of the class. There 
has been a lack of codperation on the part of students. 
The traditional class procedure develops a distorted sense 
of responsibility in that the responsibility for results is 
made to rest exclusively on the teacher. There has been 
a tendency toward formalism and perfunctoriness. The 
aims of the proposed form of recitation are: (1) to pro- 
vide a stimulating social setting; (2) to find the satisfy- 
ing activities; (3) to develop character; (4) to develop 
initiative.® 
The project—‘“When a new building is to be erected,” 
says Booker T. Washington in his fascinating volume, 
“Working with the Hands,” “the school industries join 
their activities in a common cause. The project sets in 
motion first the wagons to be used in removing the ex- 
cavated material (and made in the school shops). Then 
come the brick-makers turning out 20,000 bricks a day 
in the school kilns. . . . The school sawmill turns out 
the lumber for the building in the course of erection.” 
. . . All of this would be of little consequence for our dis- 
cussion if it represented merely a building industry. “But 
this work,” says Dr. Washington, “is for the benefit of 
the student, not to make the school self-supporting.” | 
The student is not learning subjects in any abstract man- 
ner; he is carrying on the “activity” and the learning 
°See C. L. Robbins, The Socialized Recitation (Allyn & Bacon, 1920), 
and W. T. Whitney, The Socialized Recitation (Barnes, 1915).

is incidental. This is equally well shown in another 
activity, described by Dr. Washington: “An instructor 
(is working) with a class of students who are learning 
to draw up contracts for jobs in carpentry or building. 
The contract is read aloud by the instructor, who asks 
the other members of the class to criticize it. One of 
them points out a flaw which would allow the owner to 
‘crawl out’ of his bargain on a technicality. Another is 
pleased to discover that the arithmetic is so bad that 
the estimates of the cost of material would land the con- 
tractor in the poorhouse.” 
Here we have an example of the standard subjects of 
the curriculum functioning, and of the students acquir- 
ing information, facilities, and skills not apart from, but 
incidental to very real activities. The founder of Tuske- 
gee Institute had an aversion toward the presentation of 
material “apart or separate from the uses which it serves 
in life pursuits,” and did not believe in teaching “ele- 
ments, processes, and principles used in carrying on the 
real activities of life . . . but without relationship to the 
activities themselves,” a process which Dr. Bonser charges 
against current educational practice. 
This is as good an introduction as any abstract state- 
ment that might be made of the principle of teaching 
that is now being theoretically formulated as the “pro- 
ject.” It is defined by one writer ?° as “some practical 
activity planned by the pupils,” by another’! as “a 
situation that involves a number of problems that must 
be solved satisfactorily in order to carry out the project

successfully.” “A project,” says still another proponent? 
‘4s a purposeful activity. Whatever one may purpose 
and proceed to carry out may be called a project, whether 
it be in a constructive activity, in investigation of some 
kind, in developing a skill or method of action, in en- 
joyment of any kind, or in any other form of purposeful 
enterprise.” 
There is, to a considerable extent, an exact opposition 
of interest between the continuous tendency to ever 
greater specialization in formulated knowledge and the 
needs of the pupil, which are, after all, expressible in 
terms of life activities rather than in highly specialized 
fields of information. An over-great respect for the 
boundaries between subjects gives an unreal appearance 
to the work of the school and runs the risk of having 
the information presented for its own ends without re- 
gard to function. It is interesting to learn, too, that 
this segregation of information into grooves is not so 
fundamental as might appear. “Prior to Aristotle,” we 
learn from Professor Robinson in his stimulating volume, 
“The Mind in the Making,’ “Greek thought had been 
wonderfully free and elastic. It had not settled into com- 
partments or assumed an educational form which would 
secure its universal transmission from teacher to student. 
It was not gathered together in systematic treatises. 
Aristotle combined the supreme powers of an original and 
creative thinker with the impulses of a text-book writer. 
. . . He seemed to know everything that could be known 
and to have ordered all earthly knowledge in an inspired 
codification which would stand the professors in good 
stead down to the day of judgment.”

millan, 1920.)
-P-A-G-E-391
  METHOD, MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT 375 
The effort to overcome this tendency to compartmen- 
talize information and to present it as a set of abstrac- 
tions apart from reality, has been expressing itself 
in the high schools under a synthesizing movement that 
has resulted in the organization of such hitherto unheard- 
of courses as general science; the same tendency is just 
beginning to express itself in the American colleges in the 
so-called initiatory or survey courses for freshmen; in 
the elementary school it is expressing itself by means 
of the movement which has come to be referred to as the 
project. 
The curriculum, in view of this procedure, would con- 
sist of activities. These activities develop naturally, re- 
gardless of “subjects,” cutting across artificial boundary 
lines, combining them, using them as means to ends in- 
stead of presenting the abstractions as ends in themselves 
—conforming in short to the realities of daily life. And 
so it is to be noted that it has become very difficult to 
maintain any hard and fast distinction between the field 
of curriculum and that of method. Material of instruc- 
tion and method are melting together through the use of 
the project into the new “activity.” The same phe- 
nomenon is occurring as regards the hard and fast dis- 
tinction between the various subjects of the curriculum 
itself. Separate subjects are apperently to become some- 
what less important as such, at least in the hands of the 
most expert teachers, and the departmental organization 
of the school, discussed elsewhere, seems in danger, for 
its existence ordinarily depends on the separateness of 
subjects in the curriculum. On the other hand, it is con- 
ceivable that experts in the various subjects may com- 
bine for purposes of the project so far as the child is 
concerned. Even the grouping of children in grades
-P-A-G-E-392
  376 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
must give way, for a project may be carried on by several 
grades, or indeed by the same children through several 
years; and so we come to this rather strange situation 
that along with the increasing tendency in education, 
as elsewhere in modern life, toward high specialization, 
the school has developed a peculiar process of synthesis 
which tends to abolish distinctions between groups, sub- 
jects, and, indeed, between subject and method, replac- 
ing the old ideas of drill by aims that shall be attained 
by means of “experiences,” and which ,in the course of 
development combines material and method. 
This process of synthesizing brings about a great deal 
rougher divisions and tends to center on the child rather 
than on the mastery of subject-matter. It will ultimately 
require a complete redefinition of the function of the 
teacher and of the school, and of all the old implications 
of the school institution such as type of building, type 
of texts, grades, and methods. We are parting from the 
easy simplicity involved in form, system, and precedent 
and are tending toward a bewildering but very real com- 
plexity—the complexity of life and living. For mimicry 
the school is apparently substituting “the real business: 
of living.” 
III. Measurement 
The greatest single characteristic of contemporary edu- 
cational procedure in the United States is the application 
of mathematically precise, objective and _ verifiable 
methods to the solution of the many problems in the 
field. It would not be safe to say that a great many ulti- 
mate and final scientific laws have been established in 
education. Indeed, it would not be safe to say that the
-P-A-G-E-393
  METHOD, MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT 377 
mode of procedure now being followed in any phase of 
measurement is extensive or final. Placing oneself at 
the vantage point of a century hence, it would probably 
be best to say that the workers in education are trying 
to fashion tools with which to begin to proceed scientific- 
ally in education. /Nevertheless, science in education is 
here. Education has ceased to be everyman’s field. To 
venture an opinion in the matter of education of children 
without having previously studied in this field of inquiry, 
is an unwarranted presumption. It takes little imagina- 
tion to know that in the next twenty-five or fifty years 
the education of youth will become so transformed as to 
be unrecognizable in comparison with the same process 
fifty years ago. The present generation of educators is 
making a contribution to the nurture of the race that 
is hardly to be exaggerated even by the most vivid 
imagination. 
There now exists an extensive literature on scientific 
quantitative procedure in education, and it would be un- 
just to attempt in part of a single chapter so to popularize 
or to pretend to summarize this literature as to discourage 
the student from perusing it in detail. What follows 
therefore is merely by way of introduction and in no 
sense a pretense at comprehensiveness. At most it is an 
effort to lay the field before the student, and an endeavor 
to interest him in further study. 
One of the chief characteristics of this procedure is that 
it is precise and quantitative, and that it uses as tools 
to a very great extent the method and technic of statis- 
tics. “In proportion as it becomes definite and exact,” 
says Professor Thorndike, an acknowledged leader in this 
movement, “this knowledge of educational products and
-P-A-G-E-394
  378 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
educational purposes must become quantitative, taking 
the form of measurements. Education is one form of hu- 
man engineering and will profit by measurements of hu- 
man nature and achievement as mechanical and electrical 
engineering have profited by using the foot-pound, 
caloric, volt, and ampere.” 18 
Measuring potentiality——But one cannot be scientific 
in general; one must apply one’s tools to specific prob- 
lems. The first great field to be noted in which this 
quantitative statistical procedure has been absolutely 
invaluable, and indeed, indispensable, is the field of in- 
telligence measurements. With the use of this instru- 
ment, psychologists have taken the contribution of 
Alfred Binet and established remarkably reliable stand- 
ards. Again they have developed this instrument so that 
it is now not only one for measuring single individuals, 
a process which might perhaps have barred its extensive 
use in the schools, but one which may be applied to large 
groups simultaneously. The next step in the process is 
also being attempted. As between a group of individuals 
quantitatively describable in homogeneous terms, as for 
example, persons between I.Q. 110 and 120, there are 
qualitative differences. These the science of educational 
psychology is beginning to learn to select. Tests are be- 
ing devised, says Professor Thorndike,'* to measure 
“various scholarly capacities, such as the capacity to learn 
arithmetic, the capacity to learn to spell, or the capacity 
to learn Latin.” The aid of this tool, too, is being em- 
ployed for purposes of standardizing the advice to be 
given to children, both educational and vocational.

  METHOD, MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT 379 
Measuring the product of instruction.—The second 
field to be noted is the field of educational tests. The 
complete unreliability of ordinary marking and of the 
traditional examination has been repeatedly demon- 
strated. One need state here only that many workers in 
this field are establishing accurate means of determining 
the pupil’s status in a given school subject. It has now 
become possible to apply a standard test or scale to a 
child’s knowledge in arithmetic, penmanship, or spell- 
ing, and to use the result found for very many purposes, 
as, for example, to classify him properly and locate him 
in the school, to pass judgment on the teaching ability 
to which he has been subjected, or to pass judgment on 
the suitability of the curriculum in use. 
» An interesting correlation is being established between 
the method of measuring natural capacity and the method 
of measuring achievement in standard school subjects. 
After all, achievement in a school subject is not a fair 
index to the character of the student’s school work. It 
is obvious that a given ability attained in a school sub- 
ject may be poor for a brilliantly endowed student who 
achieves it without work, and excellent for a poorly en- 
dowed student who secures it only with arduous effort. 
_ When we have measured a pupil in respect to his attain- 
ment in a school subject and his capacity for that sub- 
ject, the quotient of achievement developed by capacity 
is an important measure of accomplishment. A score of 
70 made by a capacity of 70 is obviously very different 
from a score of 70 made by a capacity of 140. 
“In elementary schools which are managed scientific- 
ally, these accomplishment quotients or ratios, familiarly 
known as A.Q.’s, are recorded year by year for each pupil. 
The pupils of great natural ability are required to do
-P-A-G-E-396
J ‘’ Sn education is being pushed in other directions and in 
  3380 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
enough more than the average to keep their A.Q.’s near 1. 
They are thus protected against habits of idleness and 
conceit. The pupils of little natural ability are not re- 
buked or scorned for failures in gross achievement. They, 
too, are required simply to maintain their A.Q.’s near 
Ae 15 
Other phases of measurement.—Scientific procedure 
these it is objectivity rather than quantitativeness that 
is being stressed. In such a field, for example, as passing 
judgment on the suitability of a building for school pur- 
poses, Strayer has established a yard-stick with which 
one may measure the building in question, and obtain 
his final judgment in terms of a numerical score some- 
where between entirely unusable and perfect. This 
method is objective but not necessarily dependent on 
quantitative or statistical procedure in its determination. | 
Rather is it a means of organizing our thinking on the 
subject of school buildings in formal terms, and in a 
manner to guard us against mere intuition, the overlook- 
ing of important features, or the giving to certain fea- 
tures of undue or too little weight. 
In other words, an attempt has been made in several 
fields, such, for example, as passing judgment on the 
quality of a teacher, to enumerate all of the factors that 
can possibly enter into the final judgment, to determine 
an exact weighting of relative proportion by asking a 
sufficiently large number of experienced judges to express 
opinions on that subject, and taking a consensus of these 
opinions, setting down measurable standards for any 
point. By this method we have arrived at fairly well

  METHOD, MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT 381 
recognized means of testing school organization, school 
supervision, teaching efficiency, school plant, and equip- 
ment. Other scales are being established. 
In some fields both types of procedure are being em- 
ployed. In judging teaching efficiency, for example, 
standard tests applied to the children represent one point 
in the chain of reasoning leading toward the ultimate 
score, the other measures representing various phases 
agreed on by educational thinkers as constituent elements 
of good teaching. The following “system for rating 
teachers,” prepared codperatively by the teaching group 
of Duluth, Minn., well illustrates this process:1°

An example of this process of formal thinking in fields 
where objectivity heretofore seemed impossible of attain- 
ment, and an illustration, too, of the various directions 
in which it is to expand in the future, is to be found in 
one of its most recent applications, namely, the selection 
of texts. Doubtless experts in particular fields have al- 
ways been able to make up their minds with considerable 
reliability, regarding the value of a text-book, but such 
reasoning was hardly verifiable, and indeed the ultimate 
result might be so dependent on the particular prejudices 
or educational ideas of the judge as not to be entirely 
reliable.17 
_ Finally it is to be noted that this procedure in educa- 
tion has given rise to-a new method of comprehensive 
examination of a school system known as the survey, a 
means which judges the efficiency of a school or of a 
school system by applying as far as possible all the 
objective criteria at hand for determining efficiency. 
For the first time in history it is possible to compare   See C. R. Maxwell, The Selection of Text-books (Houghton Mif- 
flin, 1921), and R. H. Franzen and F. B. Knight, Text-book Selection 
(Warwick & York, 1922).

school systems not in vague terms, which may be con- 
troverted, not on the basis of bombast or parochial pride, 
but in the cool, impersonal, objective, and inescapable 
terminology of science. This fact alone of the possibility 
of making surveys will more and more bring pressure to 
bear on the backward schools, and will give ever greater 
impetus to the very best in American education. 
Summary 
We have considered in this chapter briefly and for the 
sake of rounding out our general discussion, three sub- 
jects which themselves properly form the subjects of in- 
dependent volumes; namely, management, method, and 
measurement. 
In the field of management we found that practice is 
based primarily on experience, somewhat on the formal 
analysis of the problems that have been made by students 
of education, but very little on the basis of the findings 
of exact science. That we have not developed any final 
practice in this field, was indicated by reference to 
the current movement for the socialization of school 
procedure, which would quite reorganize the traditional 
classroom. The field of sociology, contributing a point 
of view for interrelations within the group most useful to 
cultivate; the field of ethics, indicating the moral quali- 
ties that may be developed and those that should not, 
passing judgment on the usefulness, for example, of such 
qualities as competition; and, finally, the field of group 
psychology, will, ultimately, each influence our thinking 
in the field of management. 
In the field of method, we again face the teaching situa- 
tion involved in the presence of the group. If all we did
-P-A-G-E-401
  METHOD, MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT 385 
were to teach the individual in the presence of the group, 
the laws of learning would suffice for our purpose. But 
we are called upon to utilize the group situation. We 
look at method as general and specific from two points 
of view; namely, general method may refer to the princi- 
ples of teaching applicable to average ability and, includ- 
ing well over half of the entire population, as contrasted 
with the special methods that should be devised for the 
two extremes of very highly endowed and very dull; or 
it may mean the general principles applicable to all teach- 
ing as against the specific methodology for certain sub- 
jects. This last is the common use. 
Work has been going on for some years toward the 
acquisition of experience in the teaching of the very dull 
and the feeble-minded. After all, it is to be expected 
in the training of these children that processes will be 
slower and limitations will be reached sooner. In the 
field of the development of the very highly endowed, on 
the other hand, where the expectations are unknown, 
little information has as yet been secured. 
The principles of general method in the commonly 
accepted sense have been the subject of study for a great 
number of years, representing, as this field does, the most 
engrossing subject of thought for the greatest educational 
leaders and thinkers, among them Rousseau, Pestalozzi, 
Herbart, and Froebel. Practically all the innovations 
under current discussion have a substantial basis in the 
thinking of these men. Two phases of general method 
currently discussed were particularly referred to; namely, 
socialization of procedure and the project. 
Measurement as an educational movement is the effort 
to apply to the processes of education, and for the pres-
-P-A-G-E-402
    386 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
ent particularly to the products of education, precise, ob- 
jective, and verifiable methods of measurement and classi- 
fication. In addition to the measurement of potentiality, 
which is really a development of psychology that has 
been adapted for educational ends, there are being de- 
veloped standard tests for measuring the outcome of in- 
struction in all fields and, as a consequence, in setting 
standards. The same general method is also being em- 
ployed for many other educational ends—as, for example, 
in measuring the efficiency of school buildings, of teachers, | 
in judging the value of text-books—and will doubtless be 
applied to other fields in ways still unforeseen. :

  CHAPTER XVI 
NINETEEN MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THE ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL 
FIELD 
Educational Problems Are Never Settled.—Educa- 
tion to the practitioner is, as we noted in the opening 
chapter of this volume, primarily a problem for solution. 
The primary factors that condition its solution are 
variable, as is the case of the child to be educated, or 
in flux, as is the case with the social organization for 
which the child is being educated; and the basic sciences 
which contribute toward the solution of problems are 
constantly enlarging in scope. All of which means that 
it is not possible in this field to arrive at final answers 
and solutions. A discussion of the problems of educa- 
tion must ever tend toward, but will never lead to solu- 
tions. It is a question of constant change and 
adjustment. 
“Experimental education, then, must be defined in 
terms of change. This means that there is no permanent 
solution for any school problem, but each one must be con- 
stantly redefined in the light of new evidence. It means 
that the educator must stand ready to open and reopen 
each question, follow where the argument leads, investi- 
gate, study, and experiment, and then from the obtained 
results evaluate, criticize, and formulate conclusions, 
which may serve only as a tentative basis for more ex- 
perimentation. . . . Nothing is ever completed. No 
391  
-P-A-G-E-408
  392 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
question may be closed up. . . . Finality is an unused 
word.” + 
But, merely because finality and fixity are neither de- 
sirable nor attainable, we must not allow ourselves the 
implication that thinking in the field of education can be 
merely metaphysical. Our thinking in Education should 
not be static—an end itself. It must be dynamic, examin- 
ing proposals with a view to their availability for im- 
mediate trial. We have in the foregoing chapters made a 
survey of the general foundations of elementary-school 
practice in the United States at the present moment, 
noting its historic background, the political, social, and 
economic factors that condition its practice to-day, and 
have found under almost every topic discussed certain im- 
mediate and still unsolved problems. It will be the 
purpose of this chapter to make a restatement of the 
problems in the elementary-school field that are pressing 
for immediate solution,—problems that have arisen 
naturally out of our discussion—in order that we may 
have before us as a direct outcome of the preceding sur- 
vey a systematic prospective of the ground next to be 
conquered. 
These topics have been gathered under nineteen main 
heads or points. In some instances there will be indicated 
merely the fact of the existence of the problem, and an 
intimation of the necessary approach to its solution. In 
other cases, definite proposals for action will be made. In 
all cases, the questions under discussion are challenging 
It will be convenient to consider these problems under 
three main headings, i.e. those involving primarily or-

ganization and administration; problems which remain 
to be thought out as basic educational theory for the ele- 
mentary school; and, finally, those questions which, 
though of essential importance in elementary-school prac- 
tice, will have to be studied by educational psychologists. 
A. Problems of Organization and Administration 
I. Enlarging the unit of control.—The suggestion 
was made in the foregoing chapters that no unit of con- 
trol now existing in America with the exception of five 
or six of the largest cities, is sufficiently extensive for 
the effective education of children in accordance with cur- 
rent educational ideals. The suggestion was made that 
the State itself be made the unit of educational admin- 
istration. There was a time when consolidation was 
urged on rural schools because they were too small in 
numbers to furnish the advantages of graded instruction, 
of enriched curriculum, and of expert supervision; but the 
time has now come when consolidated schools are them- 
selves too small to furnish the advantages of differen- 
tiated education for the gifted and dull, to provide special 
facilities for defectives such as the deaf, blind, and crip- 
pled, and children suffering from speech disorders, to pro- 
vide health supervision, requiring as that does extensive 
organization of nurses and medical specialists. The same 
arguments that applied to the consolidation movement, 
apply to-day to the suggestion that the unit for organi- 
zation be enlarged to the point where the resources of 
the State may be applied to the education of the children 
of the State. 
The greater the progress made by the most forward- 
looking cities in the field of education, the greater be-
-P-A-G-E-410
  394 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
comes the unjust disparity of educational opportunity 
within the States,—a disparity that may be noted in al- 
most any commonwealth that contains a reasonably large 
city and remote agricultural, lumbering, or mining dis- 
tricts. The presence of large numbers of children, and 
the aggregation of wealth in the cities, gives the city child 
the advantage of every educational advance and, con- 
versely, deprives the non-city child. The mere difference 
in the efficiency of the enforcement of compulsory attend- 
ance laws operates against non-city children. 
But this disparity of opportunity as between city and 
non-city children is not the only reason for suggesting 
State control. Two other considerations may be men- 
tioned in support of that form of school organization and 
control, which affect city and country children alike or 
almost alike. This form of organization would make pro- 
vision for the opportunity to make a career in education, | 
an opportunity which does not now exist and the absence 
of which bars many from entering the profession. It 
would also enable us for the first time to organize educa- 
tion in America on highly efficient lines, by establishing a 
number of parallel types of service corresponding with the 
actual development and needs of the schools. The in- 
ability to make a career in education based on the fact 
that there is little scope for promotion, and that the 
teacher must constantly change her employer, would be 
done away with by State-wide organization for the main- 
tenance of schools. Furthermore, it would be possible to 
organize the service in the form of a number of fields of 
endeavor as, for example, the field of classroom teaching; 
the field of administration; the field of supervision, ex- 
perimentation, theory, and teacher-training. By keeping
-P-A-G-E-411
MAJOR PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL FIELD 395 
open the possibility of transfer from field to field, perhaps 
by making service in one a condition for entering the 
other, by moving people in the service from post to post 
within the chosen field, we should avoid the present hap- 
hazard system which seems to offer to the mass of the 
teaching personnel little hope forradvancement and hence 
little stimulus for professional growth. 
Pending such reorganization it has become important 
that school units, even where they are as large as cities, 
make an effort to consolidate. Units which for standard 
school purposes are large enough, and can offer graded 
instruction and an enriched curriculum, will find them- 
selves too small, because of the rarity of occurrence per 
thousand of the population, for such purposes as conduct- 
ing graded schools for the blind and deaf and crippled. 
For the effective maintenance of city schools for most non- 
typical groups as well as for such purposes as health 
supervision, partial consolidation ought to be effected be- 
tween the smaller cities where possible, or between cities 
and outlying territory. 
Pending, too, State-wide organization for purposes of 
school maintenance, an effort must be made to equalize 
school opportunities within the States. An increasing 
financial support by the State on the basis of State-wide 
taxation such as was recently instituted in California is 
one manner of attaining this equalization. Measures of 
ever-increasing stringency, such as the certification of 
teachers, and the establishment of State supervision 
backed by authority, will also tend to equalize oppor- 
tunities. One of the most obvious needs in this direc- 
tion is for State-wide administration of compulsory 
education legislation. The compulsory education laws 
 
-P-A-G-E-412
  396 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
as they now stand on the statute books of the various 
States provide no very effective means for their en- 
forcement. School authorities in cities commonly main- 
tain attendance departments for that purpose, but in 
rural communities there is ordinarily only a poor means 
of enforcing the law. Communities, too, that do not ap- 
prove of the law are reluctant to enforce it. The ad- 
ministration of the compulsory education law should be 
taken from the hands of the local authorities and centered 
in a State-wide organization created for that purpose. 
II. Need for administrative control.—There are too 
many laws regarding schools on the statute books of the 
several States, and there is correspondingly too little 
power in the hands of State boards of education. It is 
a defective theory which holds that a legislative body is 
competent to make regulations in a purely technical field. 
Even if the members be competent, the means of passing 
legislation is too cumbersome, depending almost always 
on outside initiative. Moreover, legislation is uniform, 
whereas the schools must adapt themselves to variation; 
and, finally, legislation is inflexible and cannot rapidly 
adjust itself to new discoveries. 
In the field of the regulation of public-utility corpora- 
tions, most of the States have found it wise to establish 
commissions with discretionary powers to regulate their 
affairs. Such commissions may employ experts, conduct 
investigations and make rapid decisions by administrative 
order, and thus have practice conform to reality. It is 
high time that in the very technical field of education, the 
legislatures cease the practice of passing uniform laws, 
and create instead commissions exercising large discre- 
tionary powers. One of the easiest examples that may
-P-A-G-E-413
  MAJOR PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL FIELD 397 
be cited is that of detailed, uniform, compulsory educa- 
tion legislation to be found on the statute books of every 
State,—legislation which does not now conform to edu- 
cational theory. A change which could be made by the 
commission on the advice of experts with ease cannot now 
be effected without the tedious process of undertaking the 
education of the legislative body. 
III. Compulsory education regulation——The time 
has passed for uniform compulsory education laws. Cer- 
tain defectives as, for example, the deaf and blind, can- 
not be given the ordinary rudiments within the time 
usually provided. Certain types of very dull children 
may well be excused from attendance at school at an 
age below that required by the most advanced States. 
Certain unusually well endowed children ought not to 
be permitted to end their formal training at the age limit 
‘of the present compulsory school law. Such children 
ought to be retained in school even though it be necessary 
in certain instances to subsidize the parents. The present 
basis underlying compulsory school legislation is hu- 
manitarian rather than strictly and scientifically educa- 
tional. This legislation is frequently drawn quite care- 
lessly, and loaded with complicated and unnecessary 
exemptions. 
Educational theory and practice to-day demand special 
provision for physical and mental defectives. In addition 
to considerations of educational theory, compulsory edu- 
cation legislation should be based on economic consid- 
erations weighing the possible productivity of the child 
and the cost of maintaining school facilities for him 
beyond a certain age, against the loss from the social 
and individual point of view that might result from
-P-A-G-E-414
  398 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
less than adequate training. This legislation should 
also rest on what we know of psychology and physiol- 
ogy, in order that we may determine the earliest period 
at which the child may be permitted to go to work 
without handicaps that are purchased too dearly with 
the meager amount that the child may earn for the 
first few years of his employment. In place of the 
complicated part-time and child-labor laws, we need, 
so long as we depend on legislation, codified child- 
welfare laws based as far as possible on the available 
technical information, information that should eventually 
yield principles on which to determine the proper basis 
for deciding the most advisable time for beginning school 
work, and the ultimate capacity of various types of 
children. 
Finally, we require under this head, State-wide in 
place of local enforcement machinery, the abolition of 
local option in the matter of compulsion and mainte- 
nance of schools, a rigid limitation of exemptions from the 
operation of the law, and regulation of non-publicly sup- 
ported schools which children are permitted to attend on 
the theory that they are receiving instruction at. least 
equivalent to that offered in the public schools. Such 
regulation, concerning itself with attendance, curriculum, 
teacher-ability, and pupil achievement, represents the 
right of the State to interest itself in the education of 
the citizen, and would be more fair than the intolerant 
demand, making itself heard in some quarters that all 
privately maintained schools be abolished. 
IV. Teacher-training institutions and the teaching 
career.—The State teacher-training institutions face the 
problem of conforming to new facts in at least two ways. 
In the first place the establishment of the six-grade school
-P-A-G-E-415
  MAJOR PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL FIELD 399 
which is now rapidly taking place should mean a better 
use of the prospective teacher’s time available during the 
years of instruction; in the second place the depart- 
mentalization of the six-grade school, if it should find 
favor extensively, should mean a reorganization of the 
teacher-training institutions in such a way as to provide 
specialists in various fields for the elementary schools. 
One of the gravest problems now facing the teaching 
profession and, therefore, the teacher-training institutions 
is that of somehow counteracting or eliminating the 
present caste barriers that separate the various classes of 
teachers in the service of the State. The organization of 
our schools, the causes and origins of which have been 
traced in preceding chapters, is such that there is a ten- 
dency to attribute superiority to the secondary teacher 
and, indeed, to express such superiority in terms of salary 
differences. The departmentalized elementary school 
offers an opportunity in this direction. 
Some teachers will prefer to specialize in the education 
of early childhood. This desire should be recognized, 
fostered, and not held against them. Others will 
specialize in certain subjects. For these the way should 
be opened for advancement along the line of their interest 
if, perchance, they should discover a greater opportunity 
for service in the junior or senior high school. If the 
teacher-training institutions themselves do not expand 
to include training for secondary-school service, as it 
seems probable that they will in some sections of the 
country, then they should establish such relations with 
colleges and universities as will facilitate this advance- 
ment and progressive elimination of our undesirable 
present arrangements. 
Salary is an item that must be considered in this con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-416
  400 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
nection. The teaching of children is as important as the 
teaching of subjects. Given similarity of training and 
experience, there is no reason for the larger salary in the 
high school. 
It will make for the improvement of elementary edu- 
cation to do away with the hierarchal method of 
remuneration now in effect, and to base teachers’ salaries 
on training, experience, and effectiveness of service rather 
than on type of school in which work is being done. 
V. Organizing education in conformity with theory 
—the six-year departmentalized elementary school.— 
In spite of the fact that the six-year school as a proper 
form of organization is universally agreed to, the eight- 
year arrangement goes merrily on. It is most interesting 
to note what power there is in the mere fact of established 
habit. The fact that an institution has always existed 
seems to give it momentum to continue to exist, and gives 
the color of irreverence and violent sacrilege to all ef- 
forts to dislodge it. Administrators who find themselves 
excessively slow to undertake changes in accordance with 
the demands of commonly agreed upon theories for reor- 
ganization, might do well to meditate on the brilliant if, 
perhaps, somewhat facetious assertion of Professor Rob- 
inson ? that “the fact that an idea is ancient and that it 
has been widely received is no argument in its favor, but 
should immediately suggest the necessity of carefully test- 
ing it as a probable instance of rationalization.” 
We should witness almost immediately and everywhere, 
the establishment of the six-year, and possibly the de- 
partmentalized six-year school. To take up the latter 
problem first: Departmentalization of the elementary 
2J. H. Robinson, The Mind in the Making. (Harper, 1921.)
-P-A-G-E-417
  MAJOR PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL FIELD 401 
school, if the desirability of departmentalization be con- 
ceded, still remains to be thought out in detail. Nothing 
can be said to be settled as a result of the meager experi- 
mentation so far conducted. The time for beginning de- 
partmentalized work, the subjects in which teachers are 
to be expected to specialize; the group of subjects that is 
to be retained together as one field; the type of program 
and the best organization of the teaching personnel— 
these questions still remain for solution. 
But the mere regrouping of children into three schools 
instead of two is not enough. The new arrangement 
should yield very definite results. The current practice 
of conforming to this theory by regrouping children in 
buildings and even by departmentalizing the work of the 
seventh and eighth grades within the new junior high 
school is not sufficiently fundamental. Reorganization 
should mean to the child a saving of time in the accom- 
plishment of his work. Between the time of entering 
school and the time of commencing technical university 
work, the European student now gains four years on the 
American. While it may not be desirable to save that 
length of time in America, and certainly will not be 
desirable to make any such attempt at the present time, 
the reorganized three-school systems, the elementary, 
junior high, and senior high school, should between them 
send the American student to college earlier than is now 
the case. The junior high and the senior high school 
should on some basis, the details of which are out of 
place here, consume less than six years or else send 
students to college for a shorter period of additional 
training of a general character than seems necessary at 
present. If. the reorganization means that the elemen-
-P-A-G-E-418
    402 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
tary school has become more effective and that it does 
almost all of the work in six years that was formerly done 
in eight years, then the two schools which follow have 
more time than was formerly available and should show 
results. 
Finally, the impracticability of establishing a junior 
high school because of lack of numbers, need not act as 
a deterrent from the establishment of the six-year ele- 
mentary school. In such instances most of the advantages 
of the reorganization can be attained by means of the 
six-year high school and, in addition to the improvement 
of that institution made possible by the additional num- 
bers, which would automatically increase the teaching 
staff and consequently enlarge the curriculum possibilities, 
such an arrangement would, also, improve the one- and 
two-teacher elementary schools of sparsely settled dis- 
tricts, by minimizing very definitely the difficulties of 
the ungraded school. 
VI. New ideals in city organization—We may recall 
here the proposal of another chapter that the manage- 
ment and organization of city schools be democratized by 
giving the entire personnel a voice—of authority, not sug- 
gestion—in the education of the children in their charge. 
The suggestion was made that if the teachers are to be a 
professional group responsible for education, not mere 
employees charged with obedience, then the powers ac- 
tually possessed but really not exercised by the Boards 
be given to the teaching body instead of as now exclu- 
sively to the superintendent. While anything like definite 
outlining of the type of organization for the purpose of 
exercising this power is premature, the writer ventures 
to suggest the following as a basis for discussion: Let
-P-A-G-E-419
  MAJOR PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL FIELD 403 
the basic unit be the school, with the right in the hands 
of the entire staff including the principal, to make de- 
cisions in all matters that have been declared of local, 
not city-wide importance, and in which local variation is 
permitted. Let each school send representatives to city- 
wide-councils, three in number, representing respectively 
the problems of elementary, junior high, and senior high 
school education. Let these three bodies, in turn, send 
representatives to the most general and most important 
city council, meeting with the superintendent as the other 
councils meet with supervisors and other representatives 
of the central office. In each instance let there be power 
to make recommendations to the Board who exercise final 
authority, not the privilege of making representations to 
the superintendent who may or may not act on them at 
his pleasure. Finally, let the Board of Education by gen- 
eral regulation leave certain defined matters to be de- 
cided upon by the various bodies referred to, at their 
discretion. Let them formulate a constitution within 
whose provisions the various bodies may pass legislation. 
VII. A department of home contact.——The reader 
will have noted in the preceding chapters that the school 
is developing many points of contact with the home. 
The nurse on behalf of the health department is visiting 
the home for the purpose of advising regarding nutrition, 
medical care of children, and other purposes. The visit- 
ing teacher is visiting the home on behalf of Americaniza- 
tion and improving home standards. The attendance 
department enters the home either for purposes of com- 
pelling compliance with the law or in a friendly manner 
to assist in overcoming obstacles in sending children to 
school. The extension department is dealing with the
-P-A-G-E-420
    404 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
home and with the supervision of the child during non- 
school hours. ‘Parent-teachers’ associations are to be dealt 
with, and other types of work might be enumerated. 
In the larger cities these various types of contact are 
being made independently by the various departments 
enumerated. It would seem that the time has come for the 
‘establishment in the city systems of centralization of 
the departments and activities that bring the school into 
formal contact with the home. Such a department would, 
among other activities, undertake in the first place, lead- 
ership in community activities, including Americaniza- 
tion, management of day nurseries and baby clinics, or- 
ganization of and relations with parents’ associations, 
and interest itself and represent the school in such under- 
takings as the Red Cross, the movement for thrift, and 
neighborhood activities. The department would be re- 
sponsible for all types of home visiting, whether for the 
purpose of attendance, health, consultation regarding a 
child’s work, or instruction of the mother. Finally, the 
department would be responsible for all extension ac- 
tivities other than instruction, including adult recreation, 
athletic and social. 
VIII. A department of special education—Another 
department—one that has been organized in a number of 
the larger American cities and should become universal— 
gathers in the hands of one central office authority the 
educational interests of every type of deviate who requires 
special attention. Aside from the technical information 
and training necessary for those in actual charge of the 
various types of special education, there are certain in- 
terests which these children have in common, such as 
budget, selection of teachers, equipment, and centraliza-
-P-A-G-E-421
  MAJOR PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL FIELD 405 
tion, which should be centrally gathered and considered 
by one department. 
While the teachers in charge of the various types of 
deviation may be prepared to do the work for which they 
have been engaged, it will be the business of this depart- 
ment to develop a policy, to establish new kinds of work, 
and alter or combine new types. A number of important 
questions now face city systems, questions that would 
center in this department. These may be briefly 
considered. 
IX. School provision for the various non-typical 
groups.—In terms of educational theory, outlining the 
training that will make for their best interests, and for 
those classes who are properly a charge of the city schools 
rather than of the various institutions maintained by 
the State, the problem of establishing educational 
facilities of a special character still remains to a larger 
or smaller extent to be faced in most of the cities and al- 
most in its entirety in non-urban territory. This entire 
subject requires consideration on the part of districts and 
States. It will be necessary to establish more detailed 
provision for the discovery by census, as well as for the 
proper education when they have been located, of non- 
typical children. Particularly important is it to take up 
for discussion the at present controverted question as to 
whether the deaf and blind should continue to be edu- 
cated largely in residential State institutions. Finally, 
the education of cripples, for reasons already given in 
preceding chapters, would seem to be in a very particular 
sense the business of the State. At present it is dif- 
ficult to ascertain the educational status of crippled chil- 
dren. The room made in institutions for the deaf and
-P-A-G-E-422
406 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
blind after the city school systems have to some extent 
undertaken the education of the blind and the deaf, could 
be used for housing crippled children for educational 
purposes. 
X. Special full-time schools for speech defectives.— 
It is the opinion of the writer that one of the most press- 
ing problems in the field of special education is the es- 
tablishment, particularly in the larger cities, of a central 
full-time school for speech defectives, where these chil- 
dren may find the entire school organization all the time 
organized with a view to overcoming their particular de- 
ficiency; where all the teachers, regardless of subject, will 
be specially trained for dealing with these children, and 
will be accustomed to and expect the slower tempo and 
other of the characteristics of the speech defective, which 
are so annoying to the teacher of the ordinary school, 
and so tragically injurious to the child who causes the 
annoyance. 
XI. Need for a theory regarding the educational 
function of the principal.—_aA theory of the building prin- 
cipalship remains to be developed. If the principalship 
is an educational office, then the principal should function 
not as a mere medium for executing the decisions of the 
superintendent, but as a co-administrator. Agreement 
with this theory would involve, first: that assistance be 
furnished the principal for routine work in order to re- 
lieve him for educational service, and that discretion be 
given him for local-deviation from general city-wide edu- 
cational policies. The present type of city organization 
is very orderly in theory and appearance, but systematic 
and symmetrical organization is always to be regarded 
with some degree of suspicion, since life does not always 
lend itself to such complete perfection of organization.
-P-A-G-E-423
  MAJOR PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL FIELD 407 
B. Problems of Basic Educational Theory 
XII. A theory for compulsory education.—The need 
for new practice in this field was pointed out in the sec- 
tion on administrative problems; but new legislation, new 
provisions, whether made by a legislature or by an ad- 
ministrative commission clothed with authority, must be 
based on the advice of students of the question. The 
principles must be thought out by the teachers. At what 
age shall children be compelled to begin school? For 
how long a period shall they be compelled to-remain in 
school? Is it possible to discard the passage of time as 
a determining factor and deal entirely in terms of ulti- 
mate attainment in relation to intelligence quotient, and 
in that way establish an exact end for the compulsory 
period? What shall be done to meet the facts of variation 
in ability? What provisions shall be made for mental 
defectives or non-typical children of other kinds, as, for 
example, the deaf and the blind? Is it feasible to advise 
economic assistance to parents of highly endowed chil- 
dren who find it difficult to maintain them in school? 
These questions are educational in character and educa- 
tional procedure should in this field replace the humani- 
tarian theory on which compulsory education laws have 
so far been based. 
Almost all present compulsory education laws con- 
tain clauses exempting children from school earlier where 
their financial assistance is needed. At what point is it 
fair to permit this to be effected? Is it possible to es- 
tablish a quotient which shall in numerical terms indi- 
eate the end of the compulsory period, taking into con- 
sideration chronological age, intelligence quotient, and 
attainment?
-P-A-G-E-424
    408 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Although we have begun to realize that children vary 
in capacity and in the rate of development, compulsory 
education laws still remain uniform on the statute books. 
A uniform law in terms of chronological age and number 
of years spent in school can no longer satisfy educational 
thinkers. From their point of view, the time when 
formal education may begin and the time at which it 
should properly end for various types of children will 
have to be restated in educational terms, and toward this 
restatement the field of psychology has its contribution 
to make. Such differentiation, it is fair to say, it is now 
impossible to make in any objective, verifiable manner. 
XIII. Units of time and size——What is the most ef- 
fective number for the best conduct of an elementary 
school, below or above which the school would be detri- 
mentally affected? For purposes of morale, or codpera- 
tion, of school government, and from the point of view of 
the leadership of the single individual at the head of the 
institution, there must be some ascertainable, some 
favored school size. 
What is the most effective number of pupils per 
class? There must be a number below which both pupils 
and teacher lose all those advantages that come from 
class instruction as a result of the operation of the 
gregarious instinct. Similarly, there must be a num 
ber that is too large for effective work. It is clear that no 
single number can ever result from study in this field 
because type of intelligence, subject taught, chronological 
age, as well as method followed, must all contribute ulti- 
mately to a solution of this problem. 
How long shall the school year be? How long shall the 
school day be? How shall the vacations be distributed
-P-A-G-E-425
  MAJOR PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL FIELD 409 
throughout the year, and the rest periods throughout the 
day? If it is desirable that the child shall stay in school 
for a longer number of months, but a shorter day, for a 
shorter number of months, but a week of less days, or any 
other condition not now found, it will be necessary to ad- 
just school methods in terms of the ultimate solution of 
these problems. These questions represent problems in 
the field of instruction itself. 
XIV. New principles for classification; differenti- 
ated education.—Another problem facing those engaged 
in instruction, is the one involved in the difficult task of 
classifying children for purposes of instruction in the light 
of contemporary psychology. Bases for homogeneity 
must be found from the point of view of the curriculum 
as well as that of rate of progress, on the basis of the many 
factors involved, among others the fact of variation at 
any given chronological age, in intelligence, maturity, 
emotional and physical development. 
The psychology of individual differences has so far suc- 
ceeded in establishing a highly reliable method of quanti- 
tative differentiation between children whereby an index 
known as intelligence quotient may be secured. On the 
basis of this diagnosis we are now able to group children, 
to segregate them in ability groups, such as the gifted, 
the average, and the below-average types. On this basis, 
too, we must begin to establish a special theory of edu- 
cation for each group, and particularly for the group 
known as gifted. 
But within a presumably homogeneous group of gifted 
children, education to be of the utmost value should be 
individualized. If, as we believe, the potential leadership 
in every field is to be found within the gifted group, a
-P-A-G-E-426
  410 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
way must be found for determining in early life the spe- 
cific potentialities and abilities of every child in order 
that these may be fostered and cultivated. We require, 
in other words, from the field of psychology the develop- 
ment of a method of qualitative differentiation within a 
quantitatively homogeneous group, that may now be 
made up on the basis of the established methods of in- 
telligence testing. 
The ability of the school to discover ‘the children 
capable of such development, and to give them training 
in the arts from the point of view of participation both 
in enjoyment and in creation, depends on a study of the 
sequential appearance of emotions in children, a tabu- 
lation of those which are desirable and should be de- 
veloped, and those which do not have any social or 
individual value to-day. The relation of emotional de- 
velopment to physiological and mental age will be found 
important. 
The question of differentiating education in accordance 
with mental ability is still entirely open. While it is 
vaguely admitted that something should be done for the 
gifted child, and while special work has perforce begun 
with the defective child, the question is still open and 
thinkers are by no means in agreement. Even if the sug- 
gestions made in the foregoing chapters should be 
adopted, the questions still remain as to what the intelli- 
gence character of the larger or central group shall be, and 
of what the curriculum provided for the gifted child 
shall consist. 
Even after the differentiation of the population into 
three groups on the basis of intelligence quotient, the 
question of the best means of gathering children into a 
 
-P-A-G-E-427
  MAJOR PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL FIELD 411 
single class unit still remains open. The grade method 
unmodified is admittedly undesirable, and no modifica- 
tion of that method has proved completely helpful. A 
new theory for the organization of groups within each 
class that shall present sufficient homogeneity for ideal 
simultaneous instruction remains to be solved. Shall the 
school be organized into some other divisions of the six 
years than at present in terms of grades, or shall the work 
be divided into units of attainment to be realized by in- 
dividual pupils at their own rate of progress? Shall 
simultaneous instruction mean a group of children ac- 
tually attempting to cover certain ground together, or 
a group working under one teacher, each at his own rate? 
These are the many problems that confront the school 
under the general heading, homogeneity. The older 
methods in the elementary school bravely attacked the 
widely heralded evil of “retardation” on the assumption 
that it could be solved by improved teaching methods, 
corrected curriculum ideals, frequent reclassification and 
intensified attention to the individual child. The basic 
assumptions were comparatively approximate ability and 
hence universally achievable goals, if only the work on 
the part of the school were well done. To-day it is plain 
that we face a future of grouping in accordance with 
ability, curriculum goals in accordance with capacity, dif- 
ferentiated procedure, equipment, and even teaching 
personnel, 
XV. Defining the scope of the six-year school_The 
six-year elementary school does not mean the first six 
years of the old eight-grade school. The detailed educa- 
tional theory for the six-year school still remains to be 
finally established. A reorganization of the entire cur- 
 
-P-A-G-E-428
    412 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
riculum that shall make the school a consciously incom- 
plete institution so far as the child is concerned, and shall 
establish a boundary line between the elementary and the 
junior high school in specific educational terms of attain- 
ment rather than as at present, in terms largely of age, 
still remains to be thought out. It will be necessary to 
define the meaning and scope of elementary education, 
and to agree upon definite requirements that shall be 
met by the product of the elementary school as a result 
of its work. 
XVI. A theory for emotional education —The’prob- 
lem of establishing a technic for emotional education, 
which shall result in ideals, attitudes, and habits desir- 
able from the social as well as from the individual point 
of view, is at present almost entirely unsolved. We have 
learned that education does not involve as we have so 
long assumed, merely the intellect, merely the capacity 
to learn. We know full well that it is easily possible to 
know and not to do. Good citizenship, ethical private 
life, good health, and many another important objective 
involves the will, the attitude, the ideal—the emotions. 
Of any systematic knowledge of the order in which emo- 
tions appear in the life of the child; of any standardized 
means of measuring variability or intensity, or the 
possibility of fostering or curbing emotions, there is a | 
very great dearth. Indeed, this represents one of the — 
most alluring fields still almost virgin to which the educa- 
tional psychologists will have to address themselves. Not 
only intelligence, but emotions, maturity, and physical 
development all contribute toward the formulation of 
ultimate standards. The pedagogy of the emotions re- 
mains to be developed.
-P-A-G-E-429
  MAJOR PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL FIELD 413 
XVII. General and specific theory of special educa- 
tion.—It would seem reasonable to expect that physical 
defectives such as the totally blind and totally deaf would 
develop a corresponding special mental state that is some- 
what different from the typical, and characterized more or 
less by similarity within the group. A certain exceeding 
sensitiveness to facial expression, and a tendency to mis- 
interpret such expressions develops on the part of the deaf 
because they are not in a position to hear the modifying 
words. They rely, in other words, unduly on this facial 
expressiveness, and learn to read the signs more keenly 
than the hearing person. This is an introduction to the 
type of study that must be made of the special psychology 
of physical defectives to enable the teacher to develop 
these children with as much information regarding them 
as it is possible to secure. 
More important still, the defect itself, as in the case of 
speech disorders, is rooted in psychological causes which 
we are at the present time in no very favorable position 
to probe. It seems to be agreed that a very large propor- 
‘tion of speech disorders can be cured by training and 
‘without the aid of surgery, which is sufficient evidence 
that the defect is based on nervous disorders or 
psychological disorganization. A method of taking and 
interpreting the history of such cases and diagnosing 
them in the Freudian manner, if that should prove use- 
ful, will prove of untold value to the teacher and conse- 
quently to thousands of children in every generation. 
It is necessary, too, in the case of all types of defec- 
tives, to evolve in the first place reliable methods for se- 
curing general intelligence measurements within the par- 
ticular handicap, and even more important to establish 
   
-P-A-G-E-430
  414 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
certain diagnostic tests of a character to measure educa- 
tional potentiality, that would save years of time and 
energy for both child and teacher. 
In the field of the education of the deaf, for example, 
it is well known that a certain proportion of the popula- 
tion cannot master the lip-reading and speech that are 
now being favored in place of the manual method. In 
the case of these children who cannot master this method, 
much time and energy are being wasted before the fact 
becomes apparent. A diagnostic test that would disclose 
the facts is greatly needed in this field. Other tests 
in dealing with other types of deficiency will 
readily suggest themselves to the reader. The very de- 
lineation, in fact, of the meaning of typical in general 
terms, still awaits authoritative statement. 
A general educational theory for the education of the 
physical defectives still remains to be established; a 
theory that must involve social as well as educational 
considerations. A special curriculum for each type of 
physical defect conforming to this general theory, remains 
to be established. It is not enough to give a general type 
of education within the limits of his own abilities to the 
blind or deaf child. It is quite probable that special pro- 
cedure suited to his handicap can be established, involv- 
ing not only different objectives, but different methods. | 
The question as to whether the residential is the best 
type of institution for the blind and deaf still remains 
to be settled. 3 
The educational help that can be given to speech de- 
fectives is very great, but the progress so far made by the 
schools in solving this problem is very small. The 
schools are probably more retarded in their progress in
-P-A-G-E-431
  MAJOR PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL FIELD 415 
handling speech defectives than in handling any other 
type of handicapped child. A method of diagnosing 
those speech defectives that present problems for school 
procedure, still remains to be devised, as does a classi- 
fication of defects, and a set of principles for standard 
remedial procedure in the case of each defect. 
C. Problems in Educational Psychology 
All of the preceding problems dealt with under the 
topic of educational theory involve principles of 
psychology, as must be the case in every step of a pro- 
cedure which has as its goal to create modifications in 
human beings. The two problems which follow may, 
however, be said to be particularly psychological in 
character, in the sense that educational policy must await 
their solution on a psychological basis. 
XVIII. Schoolable age—The work now done in va- 
rious grades as well as the actual age for beginning school 
work, rests largely on tradition, and not on scientific de- 
termination. Is it possible to establish for every type of 
work done the schoolableness or educability for that par- 
ticular purpose in scientific terms? The bases on which 
the child is to be admitted to school, and the problem 
involved in the determination of these bases, has been 
indicated in the preceding chapters. Is it not possible in 
terms of chronological, physical, and mental age as well 
as in terms of at present unmeasurable factors such as 
emotional status and maturity, to experiment with the 
various types of school work, and establish a means of 
determining the time when each may best be begun and 
accomplished? 
When, for example, should a child enter school? We
-P-A-G-E-432
416 THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
now know that age itself is an index of no very great 
value, because by any given time children have arrived 
at different periods of development. It is a disregard of 
this fact that is now causing approximating one-third of 
all the children who enter school to fail in the first grade 
—a very expensive procedure in view of the fact that it 
is remediable. To a certain extent, it is not difficult to 
outline the probable course of the investigation to de- 
termine scientifically the proper age for beginning school. 
The entering child must have arrived at a certain physical 
status as, for example, the attainment of ordinary habits 
of self-reliance and endurance. He must meet certain 
mental conditions as, for example, mental age of the aver- 
age of the group, the development of speech, the ability 
in some way to get on with others. There is, too, an as- 
certainable period which marks the end of effective home 
training, when the work of the school may best begin. 
XIX. Truancy.—Nonattendance, as we noted in the 
chapter on that subject, has a number of causes, such as 
poverty on the part of parents, illness, attendance in pri- 
vate schools, and exploitation of the child for labor. | 
Ultimately, however, we get down to a percentage of 
nonattendance that is definitely attributable to truancy, 
defined as that type of nonattendance which originates 
with the child, and is not materially induced by adults or 
caused by uncontrollable situations. A quite definite pro- 
portion of non-attending children who qualify under this 
head will, it seems quite certain, be found to be of low 
intelligence. The unsolved problem of psychology in- 
volves the determination of the causes of truancy on the 
part of mentally normal children. 
To these questions it is safe to say that there is at the 
 
-P-A-G-E-433
    MAJOR PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL FIELD 417 
present time no authoritative answer based on scientific 
investigation. Yet it is easily ascertainable by the most 
casual observer that truancy and the dropping out of 
school on the part of educable children have tragic con- 
sequences in the lives of many children every year. We 
face here a social maladjustment, which, when not 
diagnosed and remedied in school, must conceivably in a 
certain proportion of the cases be handled later on by 
less sympathetic agencies, such as the police and courts. 
A study of the individual, involving hereditary back- 
ground, intelligence, and particularly temperament, which 
will lead to some means of standardized diagnosis, and 
which will indicate some remedy that may be applied by 
the school, is greatly needed. Certain bases for this study 
are already at hand, such as the knowledge that truancy is 
more a boy than a girl problem, and that it is at its 
height in early adolescence. It remains for the psychol- 
ogist to establish a routine procedure for discovering po- 
tential truancy and incorrigibility, to locate the root 
causes, and to outline a possible method for curing the 
child.

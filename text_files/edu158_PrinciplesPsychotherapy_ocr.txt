INTRODUCTION 
All sciences, when they have reached a certain stage 
of development, have some practical application. Can 
psychology, which claims to have become more scien- 
tific, give us any help in the treatment of certain dis- 
eases? It was this problem that I considered some 
time ago in my lectures on psychotherapy given in 1904 
at the Lowell Institute of Boston, which were pub- 
lished in my book Les médications psychologiques 
(Alcan, 1920). That three volume work owes its large 
size to the historical and bibliographical studies, and 
especially to the numerous case records which I had 
to offer in connection with each therapeutic method in 
order to show how such psychological methods of treat- 
ment have been applied and what results have been 
obtained. In the present volume I am taking up these 
studies from another point of view, giving special em- 
phasis to the methods of psychotherapy and their basic 
principles, and referring to the preceding work for 
bibliographical detail and practical applications. 
The first part of this book will summarize briefly 
the efolution of the various methods of mental treat- 
ment, pointing out their historical origin; the second 
part will be a study of the psychological phenomena 
and the laws on which the most interesting of these 
methods are based; and the third will indicate the 
conditions under which such methods of treatment 
can be applied with chances for success.

PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
CHAPTER I 
MIRACLES, ANIMAL MAGNETISM 
Medicine, like all the other sciences, had its source 
in ancient religious and magic practices. Men who 
were suffering uttered cries and called for help; their 
neighbors, driven by social tendencies already in exist- 
ence among animals, tried to care for them. Primitive 
intelligence rapidly distinguished the cases in which 
help was easy and effective, where all that was needed 
was to give food or drink to those who were suffering 
from hunger or thirst, from those cases in which suffer- 
ing and cries continued in spite of help, as happened 
with wounds and disease. Such failures brought about 
effort and excitement as their consequence and people 
began to practice all kinds of bizarre operations on the 
sick or in their neighborhood. At this period in the 
development of the mind which I have called the ap- 
petitive or pithiatic! stage, when the first volitions 
and the first unreflective beliefs began to take shape in 
the form of assertions, these practices became ritual- 
ized either in a religious or a magic form. 
Religious treatment for the most diverse diseases,

miraculous cures credited to the toll ee of the 
gods, have existed in every civilization}in every relig- 
ion; in fact, they exist to-day in the Most advanced 
cultures. We might take as an illustration the treat- 
ments and miracles that made famous the temple of 
the Asclepieion at Epidaurus, which have been well 
described by Paul Girard in his book on the Ascle- 
pieion, written in 1887. Attention was called to this 
description through the use made of it by Charcot in 
his article on “la foi qui guérit.”* The statue which 
had power to perform miraculous cures was in the 
interior of the temple. Near the statue and in various 
parts of the temple were posted servitors of all sorts 
and priests charged with various functions. Some were 
to carry or lead the sick, others were physicians who 
certified the disease at the entrance and registered the 
cure, if such had taken place, at the exit; some were 
intercessors acting as proxies for the sick at the feet of 
the god and imploring his aid in the place of their 
clients, others were interpreters charged with the expla- 
nation and application of the treatment demanded by 
the god; still others were there to keep accounts and 
to receive the numerous gifts of grateful patients. 
These patients arrived in crowds from the most dis- 
tant countries after long and wearisome journeys. On 
their arrival, in order to make the god favorable to 
their pleas, they would leave costly gifts at the tem- 
ple’s entrance and bathe themselves in the fountain of 
purification. After these preliminaries they were per-

  MIRACLES, ANIMAL MAGNETISM 5 
mitted to spend one or more nights in the porticoes 
of the temple, not yet having the right to penetrate 
farther. It was only after this anxious waiting, occu- 
pied by public prayer and eloquent pleading, that the 
invalid entered finally into the temple and received 
advice in the form of oracles or prophetic visions. 
Certain inscriptions give us the particulars of re- 
markable cures. The pilgrims who were healed in the 
Asclepieion adorned the walls with votive inscriptions 
which commemorated the miracle and at the same 
time made famous the name of the one benefited. The 
brave Valerius Aper is mentioned even to-day for his 
cure as though he had done something heroic. The 
ones who had been miraculously cured also hung on 
the walls little objects in more or less precious mate- 
rials, representing the parts of the body that had been 
healed. Legs, arms, necks and breasts in wood, mar- 
ble, silver or gold are also found in ancient sanctuaries 
in Egypt, Greece, and Rome. - 
In the middle ages, although the name of the god 
had been changed, miraculous cures remained exactly 
the same. Faith in miracles did not disappear with 
the lapse of time. Miracles performed near the tomb 
of Deacon Paris in the cemetery of St. Médard about 
1736 are among the most remarkable. Miracles occur 
even in our day, simply because medical science has 
not made sufficient advance to render them useless. 
They still take place in every country: Mr. Percival 
Lowell’s book on “The Occult Japan or the Way of 
the Gods,” published in 1894, shows us the procedure 
for miraculous cures in Japan, exactly like the cases
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
we have seen in Egypt or in ancient Greece, or those 
that occur in France to-day. Remarkable cures, de- 
scribed in a more or less impressive manner, are really 
frequent in the Annals of Lourdes and we can note 
with satisfaction that in the twentieth century we 
are not very far removed from the miracles that were 
performed at the Asclepieion several centuries before 
Christ. 
Religious treatments are not the only ones that 
deserve to be called miraculous. The essence of a 
miracle is that man should be anxious to secure a 
certain result, but that he should not know enough 
about its determining conditions to produce it with 
regularity and certainty. The forces that he summons 
to help him were first the gods, then by a natural 
evolution they became natural forces, but very mys- 
terious forces, acting according to unknown laws 
analogous, in short, to divine caprice. Many magical 
treatments are still very close to religious practices; 
they make use of ancient formule more or less forgot- 
ten which were used to invoke a god or a devil. 
One of the treatments which was, especially in 
earlier times, closely connected with such magic treat- 
ments deserves a special attention. Animal magnetism 
seems to me to have played a réle intermediate be- 
tween religious and magic treatments and psychologi- 
cal therapies. The studies which it provoked paved 
the way for the analyses of pathological psychology 
and gave a particular direction to a great part of the 
science of psychology. Some day justice will be done 
to these valiant early workers and long histories will
-P-A-G-E-15
  MIRACLES, ANIMAL MAGNETISM 7 
be written describing all their work. Here I can only 
try to give some notion of their place in the evolution 
of psychotherapy. 
Mesmer, 1734-1815, born in Vienna or Mersebourg, 
gave his name to the doctrine which was at first known 
as mesmerism, and he is considered its founder, but 
he is perhaps the least interesting among the writers 
on animal magnetism. He was clever enough to talk 
of forces then very little understood, forces of magnet- 
ism, of electricity, of nervous forces: “Planetary influ- 
ence,” he said, “exerts itself on the human body by 
means of a universal fluid in which all bodies are im- 
mersed.” Sickness is only an aberration in the har- 
monious distribution of these fluids; its treatment con- 
sists in reéstablishing this harmony by an application 
of the magnetism that emanates from a living being. 
The second period of animal magnetism, which may 
be said to have begun in 1786 or 1787 with the publi- 
cations of the Marquis of Puységur and of Dr. Pétetin 
of Lyon, but which really did not exhibit any bril- 
liance until 1813, when the first book of Deleuze ap- 
peared, began with the study of a remarkable fact first 
noticed by Puységur at his estate in Buzancy, where 
he magnetized all the sick who applied to him, accord- 
ing to Mesmer’s methods. One day he was applying 
his method to a young shepherd named Victor and 
was trying to bring about the beneficial crisis. Instead 
of beginning with contortions, the young man seemed 
to go peacefully to sleep and entered into a curious 
state in which he could move and speak and perform 
without effort whatever was suggested to him, but  
-P-A-G-E-16
  8 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
without retaining any memory of all this after his 
awakening. This state was called somnambulism by 
analogy to those natural somnambulisms of which 
many examples were known, and these writers under- 
took the study of artificially provoked somnambulisms. 
The magnetists considered that in this state the 
human mind was transformed; thought which differed 
from normal thought. must be a supremely powerful 
thought, rid of all the limitations that are imposed on 
mind by the hard necessities of our senses, the laws of 
time and space. The somnambulist made one think of 
inspired profits, of pythonesses, of Sibyls. It would 
seem rather futile to control the thought process, to 
see with closed eyes, to perform acts while sleeping, if 
we were not to be able to see through obstacles, to see 
to any distance, to know the past and the future. This 
was a revelation; artificial somnambulism became 
enormously interesting and occupied the minds of 
every one. To transform a human mind, to render it 
capable of seeing everything and understanding 
everything, of knowing everything, what a magnificent 
and divine undertaking! What service such a mind 
could render to humanity! The means of bringing 
about such mental changes must be investigated at 
any cost, as well as the means for encouraging such 
tendencies, for learning to use these wonderful tools 
which are to be created. In a word, men must set 
about to produce clairvoyant somnambulists. Such 
was the aim feverishly pursued by a host of able men 
for half a century. In this labor a wealth of inteélli- 
gence, patience and devotion was poured out, and it 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  
MIRACLES, ANIMAL MAGNETISM 9 
is the labor of these men in search of this philoso- 
pher’s stone, the “clairvoyant somnambulist,” that 
really constitutes French animal magnetism. 
This is a very singular problem and it is easy to see 
both its difficulty and its interest. It involves bring- 
ing about in a person a very profound and very 
distinct psychological change, by strict experimental 
methods and at any desired moment, and the subse- 
quent restoration of the person in question to his 
normal state without great difficulty. This change 
must not be produced by poisons capable of causing 
various forms of intoxication. According to the prin- 
ciples of the magnetists it must be obtained by means 
of an invisible fluid; that is to say, by means of an 
immaterial agent without the use of any exterior vio- 
lence or poison. The investigators, who with astonish- 
ing self-confidence set such a problem for themselves, 
will be forced to study the mental state of their sub- 
ject in order to recognize the somnambulistic change 
when it takes place. They will be compelled to take 
scrupulous note of the words and actions of their sub- 
ject, and to know his character, his memories, his sen- 
sations. The magnetists will have to form the habit 
of always writing down everything observed during 
the séances, the slightest word the subject may utter, 
the words that are said in his hearing. 
There must be minute medical observations and 
above all psychological observations made on a person 
studied in complete isolation. The magnetists will 
be obliged also to search for all the possible ways 
for transforming mental states, they will be forced
-P-A-G-E-18
10 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
to study the part played by emotion, attention, 
and fatigue. When somnambulism and its variations 
are a constant preoccupation, all the nervous and men- 
tal accidents that border on somnambulism will have 
to be considered. The magnetists were the first to 
really recognise all the neuropathic accidents and all 
the forms of nervous crises. For more than half a 
century, then, there developed a whole group of 
studies that led up to contemporary psychology. These 
two lines of investigation, the one psychological, the 
other therapeutic, aroused an unheard-of enthusiasm 
and toward 1840 animal magnetism had a period of 
development and of success that ought not to be for- 
gotten if we are to appreciate, later on, other move- 
ments of like enthusiasm although of somewhat greater 
restraint.

  CHAPTER II 
CURES DERIVED FROM ANIMAL MAGNETISM 
The magnetists had been far too ambitious from the 
standpoint of science and practice. On one hand they 
wished to create at once a complete physiology of the 
nervous system. On the other hand they dreamed of 
applying their notions immediately to the solution of 
the secrets of the world and of the future—notions as 
yet very vague, which concerned the changes of un- 
known nature that they brought about in the mental 
states of their subjects. Their self-confidence had 
caused their investigations to be ridiculed and appar- 
ently forgotten. But they raised too many problems, 
aroused too many enthusiasms to be entirely neglected. 
In spite of their failure, their influence remained pow- 
erful and gave rise to various philosophic and scien- 
tific movements which, however different they were in 
appearance, made progress in the same direction. 
1. “CHRISTIAN SCIENCE” 
The United States seems to offer a soil favorable to 
the development of these cures, more magic than 
scientific, that resemble animal magnetism. We could, 
among many others, discuss the practice of Osteopa- 
thy, which prescribes massage or the kneading of the 
muscles of the vertebral column for all diseases, be- 
1
-P-A-G-E-20
  12 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
cause all possible disorders originate in slight dis- 
placements of a vertebra. The prestige of scientific 
anatomy plays in Osteopathy the same réle that was 
played by the prestige of astronomy in the early prac- 
tice of Messmer, or by the prestige of the physical 
science of electricity in magnetic treatments. But 
Osteopathy is a somewhat restricted doctrine; we are 
better justified in selecting as one of the most impor- 
tant results of the penetration of animal magnetism 
into America the extraordinary development of “Chris- 
tian Science.” 
I have recounted elsewhere in some detail the 
strange life of Mrs. Eddy, the founder of that sect, 
because her history offers us some information of 
great interest to psychology and psychotherapy.t I 
can mention here only one important point, Mrs. 
Eddy’s nervous illness which marked the beginning of 
her whole career. Born in 1821 on an impoverished 
farm in New Hampshire, this woman, who was one 
day to be the rich and powerful head of a great religion, 
presented from her infancy serious symptoms of hys- 
terical neurosis. She frequently had violent convulsive 
attacks, followed by long periods of lethargy as well 
as fugues, or by somnambulistic delirium. Toward the 
age of thirty-five, during the winter, she slipped on the 
ice and fell to the ground in a faint. What was natural 
enough in such an hysteric, that accident left as its 
result a contracture of the leg and soon a complete 
paraplegia. The sufferer tried in vain all sorts of 
*Les médications psychologiques, 1919, Les traitements philoso- 
phiques, I, p. 44.
-P-A-G-E-21
en ne ae CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 13 
treatment and remained for some years in bed, sick 
and in despair. 
In 1861, when Mrs. Eddy was forty years old, there 
occurred an incident that completely altered her men- 
tal attitude; she was treated by the practitioner P. P. 
Quimby, who brought about a rapid cure of her neuro- 
pathic paraplegia by a simple mental treatment. It 
is this cure that was later considered the mystic reve- 
lation of “Christian Science.” P. P. Quimby was a 
former watchmaker, able and observing, who, after 
having taken part in some public séances of animal 
magnetism organized in Portland by a French mag- 
netist, had devoted himself to the practice of magnet- 
ism. He had observed, however, that the advice of 
the clairvoyant served only to implant in the mind of 
the sufferer the conviction of a cure, and that medi- 
cines were useless. He altered somewhat the practice 
of the magnetic treatment and sought primarily to 
give his patients confidence, to rid them of their fear 
of the disease. This was the origin of the notions of 
the “mind cure.” 
These ideas which had brought about her cure 
aroused great enthusiasm in Mrs. Eddy. She decided 
to remain the secretary of P. P. Quimby and plunged 
into the study of the incompleted manuscripts that he 
had written on religion and spiritual medicine. After 
the sudden death of that personage she carried off his 
manuscripts, continued rewriting them and making 
comments upon them, and everywhere represented 
herself as having a great mission to perform. Since 
she herself had no success in practicing the treatments 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
14 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
that she advocated, she resolved to limit herself to 
teaching Quimby’s theories and to have them put into 
practice through others. After much unhappiness and 
mortification caused by her pride and her jealousy, 
she succeeded in organizing a sort of medical school, 
first at Lynn, Mass., then in Boston. She charged a 
high fee for this training, which was to give her pupils 
an extraordinary ability to make cures and in addition 
assured herself a royalty on all their earnings for life. 
This Boston school, the books and journals published 
through the efforts of the pupils, the treatment of pa- 
tients, and even absent treatments consisting simply 
in thinking about patients, became a source of consid- 
erable revenue, and the establishment of the great 
director became luxurious indeed. 
In spite of serious accidents, scandals, law-suits, and 
the division of her school that gave rise to the “New 
Thought” movement, the founder of “Christian 
Science” surmounted all her difficulties. She pro- 
mulgated Draconian laws against heretics, and 
by means of energy, self-confidence and unshakable 
faith, she overcame all obstacles and attained her 
apotheosis. 
The doctrine that had so astonishing a career is 
presented in a book, “Science and Health,” first pub- 
lished in 1875, and which now must have gone 
through over 200 editions. Mrs. Eddy says that the 
book she is writing on “Christian Science” is the abso- 
lute truth; it is the soul of divine philosophy; there 
is no other philosophy. When God speaks, she hears. 
This book, which is hard to read because of its peculiar
-P-A-G-E-23
  
  CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 15 
style, contains only a few philosophical ideas and those 
very familiar and very simple, repeated again and 
again in the midst of a host of metaphors. The greater 
part of the book is devoted to the statement of a sort 
of philosophy which is a simple and aggressive spir- 
itualistic idealism summarized in three fundamental 
rules: “God is All-in-all, God is good. Good is mind. 
God, Spirit, being all, nothing is matter.” 
The negative part of this philosophy is more impor- 
tant and more developed than the first positive part. 
Mrs. Eddy has a horror of the notion of matter, and 
incessantly repeats that matter does not exist; she 
does not undertake to explain it, or to transform it; 
she is a radical and merely suppresses it. Many other 
things have the same fate; sin, poverty, disease, death, 
are equally displeasing to our reformer, and with no 
more ado she suppresses them. This is the fourth 
fundamental principle. 
Unfortunately such denials are not enough: how 
does it happen that men go on believing in the reality 
of suffering and of death? The answer is again very 
simple; this is because of an absurd error, a funda- 
mental illusion that perverts the human mind. “You 
say that a boil is painful; but that is impossible, for 
matter without mind is not painful. The boil simply 
manifests through inflammation and swelling a belief 
in pain, and this belief is called a boil; if the belief 
is done away with, the boil will be cured . . . it is the 
sick mind and not the matter that holds the infec- 
tion... .” The universal belief in death proves noth- 
ing; death will finally be discovered to be only a 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  16 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
mortal dream that comes in the shadows and that 
disappears in the light. 
Under such conditions treatment is enormously sim- 
plified, it being understood that there is never a ques- 
tion of diagnosis because the same treatment is applied 
to all diseases without exception. This therapy con- 
sists first of all in doing away with all surgical or 
medical forms of treatment, which are both useless 
and absurd. It is necessary also to do away with all 
hygienic precautions. Dyspeptics will eat and drink 
what they wish, for God has given man dominion not 
only over the fish that is in the sea, but also over the 
fish that is in his stomach. To establish complete con- 
fidence in the sufferer and in the physician, it is neces- 
sary to eliminate belief in the disease. Medicine 
teaches the denial of hallucinations. One tells children 
that they must not believe in ghosts; why then believe 
in disease which exists still less. Replace therefore all 
these medical practices so ridiculously useless, all these 
fears and false beliefs, by positive and health-giving 
beliefs, by the conviction that mind governs the body, 
not partially but completely, and know that that con- 
viction is the most effective instrument in medical 
practice. 
Doubtless neither the “scientist” doctors nor the 
poor devils, their patients, understand a word of what 
they are saying. This is compounded mainly of vague 
maunderings about God, mind, matter, sin, disease, 
health, harmony, the denial of error, ete. But it 
should not be forgotten that these vague and absurd 
utterances have succeeded in founding cathedrals and
-P-A-G-E-25
  CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 17 
in comforting millions of men. It should not be for- 
gotten that “Christian Science” is first of all a medical 
method, a therapeutic system, and that it is first and 
always a concern for the treatment of the sick that 
directs all the thoughts of its author. The basic con- 
ception of this cure is the notion of the essential in- 
fluence that the sufferer’s idea of his own trouble may 
have on the development of the disease. If the suf- 
ferer believes himself lost, the disease becomes so much 
the more serious; if he has confidence in his cure, the 
recovery is much more easy. It is this commonplace 
statement, expanded indefinitely, that is the essense of 
all Mrs. Eddy’s inspiration. Mrs. Eddy’s whole system 
appears to me designed simply to give this funda- 
mental idea a sort of logical justification and to develop 
the feeling of self-confidence and the disregard of evil. 
What is the source of this fundamental notion? The 
answer is easy to-day, thanks to the precise studies of 
several authors; this conception is the conception of 
P. P. Quimby, who treated and cured Mrs. Eddy’s 
paralysis in 1861, who explained to her his doctrine, 
and who confided to her his manuscripts. “Now,” he 
said, “I restrict myself to the denial of disease as a 
reality; I admit it only as error, like the other baseless 
stories that are handed down from generation to gen- 
eration and become a part of the life of the people.” 
To arrive thus at the denial of the existence of disease, 
Quimby insisted also on the superiority of mind, on the 
non-reality of what is inferior and material, and he 
also developed a vague idealistic system quite like 
that we have seen in his pupil.
-P-A-G-E-26
  18 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
The childish protestations of Mrs. Eddy are of little 
importance. The best one can say in her behalf is that 
as a delirious hysteric she had in a high degree the 
power of transforming her own desires into sincere 
belief. It is enough for the history of psychotherapy 
to notice that this curious doctrine belongs to P. P. 
Quimby, and this is of interest in understanding the 
background of these ideas, because Quimby is above 
all a student of the French magnetist, Ch. Poyen, who 
had introduced the doctrines of Deleuze to America. 
We find in Christian Science also traces of magnetism, 
in its theories of the unconscious, of the relation be- 
tween practitioner and patient, of the power of the 
will, of the communication of thoughts, and in its 
theories concerning diagnosis at a distance in “absent 
treatment.” The flagrant attacks against magnetism 
have no importance; they are only family quarrels, 
and it is interesting to note that “Christian Science” 
in America is the outgrowth of animal magnetism. 
2. HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION 
Although animal magnetism was thoroughly dis- 
credited in France after the judgments pronounced by 
the Academies, it did not disappear completely; by 
easy stages it took on another form and out of it came 
the practices of hypnotic suggestion. 
For a considerable time, observers had remarked 
that in certain persons strange modifications of be- 
havior were related to certain thoughts. The effects 
of charms and amulets were already known to well- 
informed minds in the middle ages. In the seven-
-P-A-G-E-27
  CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 19 
teenth century, Malebranche was working on “the con- 
tagious communication of powerful imaginations.” At 
the end of the eighteen century, Maine de Biran, de 
Beauchéne, and Demangeon applied the general laws 
of thought to facts of the same sort. 
This investigation became much wider in scope when 
it was decided to examine from the same point of view 
the phenomena that appeared during the séances of 
artificially produced somnambulism. In 1823, Ber- 
trand described the movements and acts that a word 
can evoke in somnambulists and the hallucination that 
it can arouse in their imagination. He was one of the 
first to notice what may be called negative suggestion, 
and the suggestion whose execution is delayed. Deleuze 
(1815-1825), the Abbé Faria (1825), Despine of Aix 
(1840), Teste (1845), Charpignon (1842-1848), Dupo- 
tet (1845), Perrier (of Caen, 1849-1854), offer remark- 
able descriptions of a mass of facts of the same order. 
It seems probable that the use of the word “suggestion” 
dates from Braid, but, theory aside, his works contain 
nothing in the way of new facts. 
From the beginning of the theory of animal mag- 
netism there began a famous dispute, that between 
the fluidists and the animists. The former wished 
to explain the changes in a subject’s state by the physi- 
cal action of a fluid given off by the magnetist; the 
latter contended that everything was dependent on 
changes wrought in the psychic phenomena of the 
subject. For them, the magnetist’s activity was a 
mental activity that altered thoughts, and this mental 
change determined the rest. At that time there is
-P-A-G-E-28
  20 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
already apparent the whole difference between mag- 
netism and hypnotism. These two lines of investiga- 
tion apply, indeed, to the same phenomenon, namely, 
artificially provoked somnambulism, but what charac- 
terizes hypnotism is, first, that it takes up a more 
scientific attitude toward these phenomena and that it 
seeks to eliminate the marvellous, the occult, and the 
miraculous, with which magnetism is bound up, and 
further, that it explains the facts through the phe- 
nomena and laws of psychology instead of appealing to 
forces borrowed from the physical or the physiological 
world. This being the situation, hypnotism begins 
with Bertrand in 1820. He is the first to say in so 
many words that artificial somnambulism can be ex- 
plained simply by the law of the imagination of the 
subject, who goes to sleep of his own accord because 
he thinks about going to sleep, and who wakes because 
he has had the idea of waking. The work of Abbé 
Faria, of General Noizet in France, of Braid in Eng- 
land, did no more than develop and make precise that 
conception and psychological interpretation. 
At that time, moreover, the majority of these studies 
had another object and were primarily directed at 
therapeutic results. At their very first appearance 
suggestion and hypnotism were immediately applied 
to the treatment of diseases. In the beginning at 
least, the hypnotists seem to have been less ambitious 
and more prudent than the magnetists. They made no 
pretense of curing all possible disease and their com- 
ments show that they devoted themselves particularly 
to the treatment of nervous disorders. Not only the
-P-A-G-E-29
  CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 21 
hypnotists whom I have just mentioned, but also med- 
ical alienists such as Laségue, Morel and Georget show 
that they obtained some good effects in hypnotizing 
neuropaths. The work of Liébault, 1860-66, is worthy 
of particular notice from the standpoint of ther- 
apy and demonstrates throughout the record of 
a long medical practice the good results that can be 
secured by the preserving use of hypnotic sugges- 
tion. 
In order to assure the success of hypnotism, and to 
give it an immediately practical réle, a special attempt 
was made to use it to bring about surgical anesthesia. 
Unfortunately the discovery of ether anesthesia, which 
was much more easy and certain, gave a fatal blow to 
experiments in this direction. A small number of 
works continued to be published, such as the little 
book of Demarquay and Giraud Teulon, and, toward 
1865, suggestion and hypnotism seemed to be forgot- 
ten, as was animal magnetism itself. 
During twenty years or thereabouts the despised 
hypnotism was abandoned to charlatans. Some heal- 
ers still used it in secret and several demonstrators 
gave public exhibitions of subjects more or less genu- 
inely hypnotized. Scientific. men no longer dared_to 
concern themselves with hypnotism. It was confused 
with the animal magnetism of ill repute. They vaguely 
felt that its investigation would be difficult and com- 
plicated and to avoid confessing a certain reluctance, 
they preferred to insist that such investigation was 
made impossible by the continual danger of shamming. 
They considered it as unquestionable that all the
-P-A-G-E-30
  
  22 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
errors committed were due to the mistakes of the 
subjects and their bad faith. 
It was the work of M. Charles Richet, 1875-1883, 
that successfully attacked this prejudiced belief in 
“faking.” The studies of M. Richet were the occasion 
for a group of works on hypnotism, to my notion of 
great interest, that took up in an unprejudiced fashion 
the subject of artificial somnambulism from the stand- 
point of a psychological analysis of all its manifesta- 
tions. A psychological school of hypnotism centers 
about M. Ch. Richet, but at first it was not well 
known because it was overshadowed by the develop- 
ment of two other schools, less interesting from the 
scientific point of view, but much more conspicuous. 
The first of these two schools was that directed by 
Professor J. M. Charcot at Salpétriére. Being profes- 
sor of the clinic in diseases of the nervous system, 
Charcot understood very well the possible importance 
for medicine and philosophy of the study of these 
states of provoked somnambulism, which had been 
repeatedly brought to notice for more than a century 
and always rejected without examination by official 
science. But, in order to undertake this dangerous 
investigation with prudence, he proposed, on the one 
hand, to place himself entirely out of the reach of the 
danger of shamming, then believed so formidable, and 
on the other, to bring to bear on his study an irre- 
proachable scientific method. Before studying the 
delicate psychological phenomena that occur in a 
woman’s mind when she is in an abnormal condition, 
it is necessary first to know the precise characteristics
-P-A-G-E-31
  CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 23 
of that abnormal state and to be able to recognize it 
by clear signs that cannot be imitated. For a neu- 
rologist used to the examination of tabes and lateral 
sclerosis, the clear and unmistakable symptoms were 
changes in the state of muscles, reflex movements, and 
the degree of various sorts of sensitivity. With his 
very first co-workers, Bourneville, Brissaud, Paul 
Richer, Ruault, Londe, who share with him the crea- 
tion of major hypnotism, Charcot aimed at a precise 
classification of these elementary changes of conduct. 
According to the combinations of these various reac- 
tions they distinguished in the hypnotic sleep three 
very distinct states that followed in order, lethargy, 
catalepsy and somnambulism. It was observed like- 
wise that these various states could be halved, that is 
to say, confined to one side of the body. Finally, it 
was noted that all these effects could be clearly ob- 
served only in subjects already affected by a nervous 
disorder, that is, by hysteria. 
Such are the notions that were presented by Charcot 
to the Academy of Sciences, Feb. 13, 1882, in a com- 
munication concerning the different nervous states 
brought about in hysterics by hypnotism. It must not 
be forgotten that the Academy had already three times 
condemned all the research on animal magnetism and 
that it was a real tour de force to get it to accept a 
long description of quite similar phenomena. It was 
believed, and Charcot himself believed, that this whole 
study was a far cry indeed from animal magnetism, 
and was, in fact, a definite condemnation of the latter. 
This is the reason why the Academy did not rebel, 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
and accepted with interest a study bringing to an end 
the everlasting quarrel over magnetism concerning 
which many of the members had some qualms of con- 
science. 
Charcot’s success was of great importance. It 
might be said that he had broken a dam that had for 
a long period held back a threatening torrent. On all 
sides “Hypnosis redivivus,” as Hack Tuke said in 1881, 
inspired countless studies. A list of authorities would 
have to include the names of all the neurologists of 
that period, French and foreign, because the greater 
number of them were devoting themselves to the doc- 
trines of Salpétriére. 
In 1884 there appeared in the form of a small pam- 
phlet of 100 pages, simple, alive, and easily read, the 
manifesto of another school. M. Bernheim, professor 
of the faculty of medicine at Nancy, made public the 
research that he had been pursuing for several years 
in entire independence of the Paris teaching, and let 
it be understood that he had a very different concep- 
tion of these matters. M. Bernheim does in fact take 
a point of view quite different from that of Charcot. 
The question of deceit and the precautions to be taken 
against it, do not stop him for a moment. He makes 
scarcely a discreet allusion to it. And since he is not 
at all concerned with deceit, he makes no effort to 
describe the state into which he puts his subjects, but 
restricts himself to a description of the methods he 
uses for transforming them, and of the results that 
he obtains. In order to bring on the hypnotic state, 
he, like the Abbé Faria, does no more than order sleep,
-P-A-G-E-33
CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 25 
and assert its symptoms, and when sleep appears to be 
brought about, he causes, also by verbal assertion, the 
execution of all the positive, negative, or post-hypnotic 
suggestions that had been described by the first hypno- 
tists. 
These phenomena, says M. Bernheim, are very easily 
understood. They are only the exaggeration of very 
common behavior that is observed in all men; they 
are sufficiently explained by the hypothesis of a faculty 
of natural credulity. The hypnotic state is simply 
characterized by a certain increase of suggestibility, an 
increase, moreover, that is itself the result of the sug- 
tion of sleep, or drowsiness. It should not be thought 
that this state can be brought about only in the ex- 
ceptional neuropathic individual. Doubtless there are 
degrees of impressionability, and there are individuals 
more disposed to passive obedience because of their 
education or their calling, but “experience shows that 
the very great majority of persons attain it (hypnosis) 
easily.” These are the facts and the very simple ideas 
that M. Bernheim makes public in his pamphlet, giv- 
ing us to understand at the end of the volume that a 
knowledge of them, and the applications that result, 
may have very important consequences. 
During the following years these studies were con- 
tinued by M. Bernheim and his immediate co-workers. 
And among these special mention must be made of 
Beaunis, Professor of Physiology in the Faculty of 
Medicine at Nancy, and of Liégeois, Professor in the 
Faculty of Law in the same city. These authors sought 
particularly to prove the power of suggestion, and
-P-A-G-E-34
  26 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
were interested in the problem of blistering by sugges- 
tion and in the problem of criminal suggestion. The 
school of Nancy pays much attention to this last prob- 
lem. M. Bernheim and M. Liégeois bring their sub- 
jects by suggestion to commit horrible crimes with 
wooden knives and toy pistols, and consider the in- 
fluence of suggestion extremely important and dan- 
gerous. 
After the study of criminal suggestions, the chief 
characteristic of this group of authors is the desire to 
make immediate use of this suggestion which seemed 
so powerful in the treatment of a great number of 
diseases. It is mainly the record of cures that increased 
the second edition of M. Bernheim’s little book. 
All these studies, however interesting, did not mark 
this group of workers with any very decided unity or 
originality, but one further issue established the school 
of Nancy. What characterized the school and gave it 
its unity was, as often happens, a common enemy. 
The school of Nancy had been first of all opposed to 
the school of Salpétriére. In an article on the “Réle 
of Fear” in 1886, and more particularly in the second 
edition of his book, M. Bernheim openly attacked the 
doctrine of Charcot. “The observers of Nancy,” he 
said, “judge from their experiments that all these 
phenomena noted at Salpétriére, the three phases, the 
neuro-muscular hyper-excitability of the period of 
lethargy, the special contracture provoked during the 
so-called period of somnambulism, the transfer of mag- 
netic force, do not occur when one makes the experi- 
ment under conditions such that suggestion plays no
-P-A-G-E-35
  CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 27 
réle. The hypnotism of Salpétriére is a trained hypno- 
tism!” Another point is made equally clear: while 
recognizing that this susceptibility to hypnotism is 
very marked in hysterics, M. Bernheim considers that 
hypnosis is not a morbid state peculiar to neuropaths; 
it is a physiological state in the same sense as normal 
sleep, and it can be produced in the majority of sub- 
jects. 
The battle was on: the lieutenants of Charcot, in 
spite of their deplorable situation, fought with cour- 
age, at least as long as their chief was living. There 
was fine defense and vigorous counter-attack. In these 
engagements the defenders of Salpétriére carried off 
several partial successes. One of the most interesting 
was gained in the discussion of criminal suggestions, 
in which they certainly had the better part. But at all 
other points of the field of battle they were meeting 
defeat. Most of the other observers attached them- 
selves openly to the belief of M. Bernheim and declared 
that these phenomena were simply the result of un- 
skilled suggestion and involuntary training. Even the 
students of Charcot acknowledged this by implication 
because they ceased to defend themselves and aban- 
doned the field of battle, but they have never openly 
recognized their defeat. I believe that it is time for that 
to be done. Charcot’s three phase hypnotism, as M. 
Bernheim has well pointed out since 1884, was never 
anything else than a trained hypnotism. It is he 
who won the battle. 
I have had occasion to investigate from the his- 
torical point of view how there came about this singu-
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
lar adventure in which the Clinic of Salpétriére was 
implicated.? The study of one of my old records of a 
woman patient of 45 years, a study made at Havre 
from 1883 to 1889, and one that presented phenomena 
quite analogous to Charcot’s three states, led me to 
the belief that she had been trained in her youth by 
a magnetist, Dr. Perrier of Caen, and I came to dis- 
cover in the writings of the old magnetists all that 
is essential in major hypnotism. It is certainly very 
strange to note that Charcot presented to the Academy 
of Sciences in 1878-82 some pretended discoveries 
destined to definitely discredit the claims of the mag- 
netists and then to find that these discoveries had 
been the very doctrine of the magnetists for fifty years. 
The contest between the school of Salpétriére and the 
school of Nancy had only been an episode in the great 
war that had already begun in 1787 between fluidism 
and animism. The animists won that first engage- 
ment. When will be the next engagement and who 
will be the final victor? That defeat of the school of 
Charcot does not seem to have brought any benefit to 
hypnotism. There is no doubt that, beginning with 
1888 to 1896, in foreign countries as well as France, 
there was a veritable blossoming of cures by sugges- 
tion. It had everywhere its special reviews, and, more- 
over in all the reviews of neurology, medicine, and 
philosophy, in a great number of medical theses, and 
in numerous volumes were set forth the stories of in- 
numerable cures of all possible maladies by simple 
verbal suggestions, whether during the condition of 
* Les médications psychologiques, 1920, I, p. 170.
-P-A-G-E-37
  CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 29 
hypnotic sleep or during the waking state. This suc- 
cess was of short duration. After the death of Charcot 
in 1892 we see hypnotism already in its decline. In 
medical circles hypnotism was not denied; no one 
doubted the acknowledged power of suggestion. It 
was simply no longer discussed. The number of publi- 
cations on these subjects decreased enormously. Re- 
views that were proudly entitled “Reviews of Hyp- 
nology,” feeling the change of wind, hastened to mod- 
ify their title. Hypnotism maintained itself a while 
longer in other countries, then it disappeared every- 
where, as in France. Physicians began to talk of the 
danger of these treatments recommended a few years 
earlier as so inoffensive and so beneficial. To go 
farther, they began to make curious charges of im- 
morality against suggestion. It appealed to the pa- 
tient’s lower faculties. A cure obtained in this fashion 
did not make enough demand on the patient’s own 
will. It was unearned. It had degrading possibilities. 
' And finally this treatment would, it seemed, lower the 
moral dignity of the physician, who would take the 
attitude of a miracle worker, and Dubois (of Berne), 
declares that he blushes when he remembers that he 
has used suggestion with a child to prevent his wet- 
ting the bed. 
In my extended study of this curious period in the 
history of medicine, I tried to find some explanation 
for the neglect and decay which followed so closely 
on such enthusiasm and such development. In the 
first place, it is certain that the contest between the 
school of Salpétriére and the school of Nancy was
-P-A-G-E-38
  30 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
disastrous for hypnotism itself. The victory of the 
animists was not well received, at least in the scien- 
tific world. They acknowledged it but deplored it. 
The doctrine of Charcot that it defeated was clear, 
definite, and easy to study; it seemed to bring animal 
magnetism within the limits of physiology, and that 
looked like scientific progress. What was it that the 
school of Nancy put in place of this fine dream? A 
few vague assertions on suggestibility and credulity 
that could not be discussed or understood without 
going into the new studies of psychology. But psy- 
chology, considered a confused mixture of literature 
and ethics, had no standing in the school of medicine, 
And, indeed, it is a question whether psychology, as it 
was at that period, deserved to be more studied by 
physicians. It may be added that the enthusiastic 
exaggerations of the hypnotists had brought about the 
random application of hypnotism in all sorts of dis- 
ease, without any indication of its fitness, and that 
the usual results were meaningless or absurd. 
Under these circumstances, the decline of hypnotism 
has no great significance. It is the result of acci- 
dental causes, of the feeling of regret and deception 
following unguarded enthusiasm. It is only a passing 
accident in the history of artificial somnambulism and 
in the history of psychotherapy. 
3. THE MSTHESIOGENIES 
The work of the magnetists, extending over such 
a great field, had brought to light a number of phe- 
nomena that, more or less well understood, have served 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 31 
as the point of departure to research and interesting 
therapeutics. 
When curiosity leads one to glance over these old 
books, here and there are found descriptions of queer 
instances of somnambulism, characterized by a kind 
of sudden and temporary cure of sufferers who had 
been up to that time decidedly neuropathic and de- 
pressed. The author who gave the most striking 
description of phenomena of this sort is, I believe, 
Despine (of Aix) in a curious work, “Traitement des 
maladies nerveuses par le magnétisme aux eaux d’Aizx,® 
1840. It is a study of the illness and the treatment of a 
young girl of sixteen who displayed a serious hysterical 
condition. Estelle, following upon a fall which was in 
itself of little importance but which happened under 
exciting circumstances, was taken with a complete 
paraplegia with anesthesia of the whole lower part of 
the body and disturbances of sensation in the upper 
part. She suffered also from anorexia, and could toler- 
ate without vomiting only a much restricted and very 
bizarre diet. She complained of a constant feeling of 
cold and remained wrapped in shawls, sleepy, listless 
and without voluntary activity, but in a highly sug- 
gestible state. 
In the course of various attempts at hypnotism, 
there developed a curious state that Despine called 
the “crisis.” This state was characterized by the com- 
plete return of movement and sensation, by the re- 
establishment of appetite and digestion, and by the 
*Tr. note: Treatment of Nervous Diseases by Magnetism at the 
Waters of Aix. 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  
  32 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
disappearance of the sensation of cold. Her character 
was entirely altered. Estelle became firm and resolute 
in her decisions, and she was no longer open to sugges- 
tion. Unfortunately this crisis could not be long main- 
tained and after the awakening the subject would 
relapse into paralysis, apathetic, without appetite, 
shivering because of constant chill, and completely 
suggestible. Furthermore, she retained little or no 
memory of the preceding happy period. Facts of this 
sort, that is to say, the artificial production of crises 
with a complete but temporary restoration of nor- 
mal health, are described in various phrases. They 
may be called the “crises of exaltation of the mag- 
netists.” 
For the sake of historical order, I feel justified in 
connecting with these first observations some studies 
and a school now forgotten, the studies of metal- 
lotherapy and the school of Burg. The latter took over 
the old ideas of the Middle Ages and of mesmerism 
on the influence of metals, and connected them with 
clinical observations like those just described. From 
1851 to 1885, particularly in his book on “The Origins 
of Metallotherapy,” Dr. Burq studied “the modifica- 
tions produced by the application of metal plaques on 
the skin of patients, and by the internal use of these 
same metals.” Pieces of some metal suitably chosen 
are applied to the skin of the insensible member and, 
after several tremors, a complete return to sensibility 
is observed. At the same time there appear other 
changes in peripheral temperature, changes in the 
circulation, and especially changes in muscular 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 33 
strength. These changes gradually become more 
marked and bring to pass the disappearance of all the 
neuropathic disorders and a general transformation of 
the individual. 
In 1876, Burg presented his experiments to the Bio- 
logical Society, which appointed a commission to ex- 
amine their validity. Charcot was the president of 
that commission and caused the experiments to be 
repeated in his clinic at Salpétriére. This was a small 
event that had an enormous influence on the teaching 
of the clinic. The studies made at the clinic on the 
phenomena of metallotherapy were vitiated by the 
same mistakes in method that had affected the studies 
on somnambulism. Their attention was directed only 
to the physical aspect of the experiment, without rec- 
ognizing that the phenomena involved were mainly 
psychological and that moral precautions were of pri- 
mary importance in such investigations. All this work 
which seemed so well launched stopped abruptly, and 
after 1885 there is no further trace of it. 
The reason for this sudden eclipse is simple enough. 
It is to be found in the first publications of M. Bern- 
heim, and in the opening of hostilities between the 
schools of Nancy and Salpétriére. The dispute had 
begun in the eighteenth century with the works of 
John Hunter and had been renewed by Hack Tukes’ 
book, “Influence of the Mind on the Body,” in 1872, 
and hence it had been for a considerable period that 
the critics had been insisting that most of these facts 
were caused by the influence of the imagination and 
of “expectant attention.” But the physicians had not
-P-A-G-E-42
  34 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
understood the importance of the objection and the 
practical difficulties that it raised. We find here prob- 
lems like those encountered at the beginning of Pas- 
teur’s work on pure cultures and spontaneous gen- 
eration. His opponents always believed that it was 
quite easy for them to protect their cultures from all 
contamination and only offered cultures that had been 
polluted by all the germs of the air. Many preferred 
giving up their research to learning how to make 
proper cultures. 
The doctrines of the magnetists on “crises of exalta- 
tion,” and the doctrines of Burq’s disciples on esthesi- 
ogeny have for me a lively interest because at the 
beginning of my own work I had occasion to observe 
a series of facts quite similar to those that furnished 
the basis for these doctrines. In examining the hys- 
terical patients who presented various paralyses, am- 
nesias, disorders of sensation more or less apparent, 
and disorders of the will, I sought in various ways to 
get rid of or at least to modify these symptoms— 
through suggestion, training, stimulation of memory 
or sensibility. These methods brought about in some 
patients the appearance of states that seemed to me 
very strange because they contrasted so completely 
with the condition of these persons in illness. Some- 
times these states made their appearance gradually 
after the subjects had made efforts to move, to per- 
ceive correctly or to recover their memories, and they 
were preceded by contortions, or by disorders of appe- 
tite or varied disorders of sensation, or, indeed, they 
appeared in the course of an artificial somnambulism,
-P-A-G-E-43
CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 35 
following on a period of deep sleep. Their most prom- 
inent characteristic was the complete disappearance 
of all the pathological symptoms. The disorders of 
movement, the paralyses and contractures no longer 
existed. A woman who had suffered from a paraplegia 
for eighteen months could walk and run as in the case 
of Estelle described by Despine of Aix. Vomiting 
ceased and the sufferers were able to take food, while 
normal sensitivity appeared over the whole body. 
Memory was extended to include all the past, including 
even the periods that had seemed completely forgotten. 
Finally, the disorders of will could no longer be noticed 
and it became impossible to demonstrate suggestibility. 
“The final somnambulistic state,” I said in that con- 
nection, “is a state in which the subject, no matter how 
depressed and sick he may be in the waking state, 
becomes quite identical with the individual in his best 
and most normal condition... .” It is a state in 
which the subject has regained the complete integra- 
tion of his senses that is natural to a healthy man, 
and a complete integration of memory. In a word, 
it is a state in which there is no more anesthesia and 
no more amnesia. It is a state that is important from’ 
all points of view, and especially from the point of 
view of therapy.‘ 
In my first studies of these problems I endeavored 
to bring out the fact that there was nothing in itself 
extraordinary in this state just described, that it was

merely the state that should have been normal and 
usual in these women, but a state in which they could 
not remain because of their unhealthy depression. In 
fact, it was with great regret that I noted that the suf- 
ferers did not long remain in this state of complete res- 
toration, for I had based some hope of cure on the 
prolongation of this state. If they were left in this 
condition, they would, sooner or later, relapse and the 
paralyses, amnesias and other disorders would reappear. 
Furthermore, a new phenomenon, which at the mo- 
ment seemed to me very important, was added to the 
others already described. This was that when these 
sufferers relapsed into their habitual state of illness 
they usually displayed a complete amnesia for this 
period of artificially produced health. These amnesias 
brought about gaps in the sequence of memory and 
they gave rise to various alterations of personality. In 
a word, these amnesias, occurring after a relapse, gave 
the periods of normal health the appearance of som- 
nambulism. This is why I have used the term com- 
plete somnambulism to indicate these periods of tem- 
porary recovery, a term already used by Azam to 
describe some similar phenomena. 
In these same studies I called attention to the feel- 
ings of the subject at the moment the alert condition 
began, to the bizarre expressions that he used to de- 
scribe the pains in his head, such as snapping threads, 
or globes of glass that ring in his head, to the feelings 
of joy, of gaiety, of pleasure, that he experienced on 
seeing the light grow brighter and objects more color- 
ful, to the satisfaction that he felt in his re-discovery

of himself, and to the changes of character that brought 
to pass true alternations of personality. This research 
was continued by other authors, but their number was 
small because the decline of hypnotism then in progress 
rendered unattractive any work that was directly con- 
cerned with the old magnetism. Some mention, how- 
ever, should be made of the work of M. P. Sollier on 
treatment by the rehabilitation of sensation, which 
belongs to this same movement. 
These “complete somnambulisms” are in their essen- 
tial characteristics quite analogeus to the “crises of 
exaltation” of the magnetists, to the transformations 
of metallotherapy and esthesiogeny. They are thera- 
peutic attempts of the sort that will later give rise 
to certain interesting treatments by stimulation. 
4. THE LIQUIDATION OF TRAUMATIC MEMORIES AND 
PSYCHOANALYSIS 
If the treatments by zsthesiogeny have not, up to 
the present, had any very striking career, this is not the 
case of the search for subconscious traumatic memories 
that I had derived from some studies of somnam- 
bulism, which have given rise to various branches of 
psychoanalysis. We have in this a considerable devel- 
opment of psychotherapeutic practice that recalls the 
enthusiasm aroused by mesmerism, christian science, 
or hypnotism. 
The magnetists had all called especial attention to 
the memory during the periods of provoked somnam- 
bulism. They had frequently described a curious fact, 
namely, that the subject, during that state, can re-
-P-A-G-E-46
  38 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
count a mass of events from his life to which he never 
refers during ordinary waking moments, and which 
seem to be completely forgotten on waking. In ex- 
amining these modifications of memory, I had occasion 
to remark in my first studies of 1886-1889 that this 
amnesia concerned not only events that had taken 
place during periods of somnambulism, but that it 
often concerned, in addition to these periods, certain 
events of normal life when these events had been 
accompanied by violent emotion. Thus, a young hys- 
teric whom I described at the time under the name 
of Marie recounted during somnambulism that at the 
age of thirteen she had been frightened by the appear- 
ance of her first menstruation and that she had tried 
to stop it by getting into a tub of cold water, a measure 
that had indeed stopped the flow, but that had at the 
same time brought about great distress, tremors, and 
delirium. During the same somnambulistic state she 
also told that she had been frightened on seeing an 
old woman fall down a staircase and cover the steps 
with her blood; and that, on another occasion, she 
had been forced to go to bed with a child whose face 
was covered with a rash on the left side, and that she 
had experienced all that night great disgust and great 
fear. Outside these somnambulistic states she seemed 
to have no memory of these events. For the rest, 
this patient showed various neuropathic symptoms, 
crises of convulsions shortly after the beginning of 
menstruation with stoppage of the flow, and tremor 
and delirium, hallucinations in which she saw blood, 
spasms, and disorders of sensation on the left side of
-P-A-G-E-47
  CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 39 
her face, accidents that seemed clearly related to the 
memories recounted during somnambulism. My writ- 
ings of this period contain the description of many 
cases of that sort.® 
It was not hard to connect these observations with 
the interpretations that Charcot had given some time 
before to certain hysterical paralyses. In his studies 
of 1884-85 he had shown that the physical accident 
was not the cause of the consequent illness, but that 
it was necessary to assign a réle to the memories left 
by the accident, “to the ideas, and to the concern that 
the invalid maintained in this connection.’ Many 
observers, and Moebus (1888) in particular, took up 
this notion and acknowledged that “certain hysterical 
accidents were physical changes connected with ideas 
and memories.” I enlarged this conception somewhat 
by showing that neuropathic troubles of the same sort 
could develop from a more simple series of events that 
did not cause any physical wound, but an emotion 
purely psychic. The memory of the event persisted 
in the same fashion with its train of various feelings, 
and it is this memory that determined, directly or in- 
directly, certain phases of the illness. These disorders 
may be called traumatic memories. 
In the cases I have just mentioned, the traumatic 
memory presented itself in a special manner; it could 
not be expressed during waking consciousness, and it 
reappeared only under special circumstances in a dif-

  40 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
ferent psychological state. In this we find again a 
well-known characteristic of hysterical fugues; the 
subject can recount his fugue and the reasons that have 
determined it only if he is put into a state of som- 
nambulism, and he seems, during his waking moments, 
to have forgotten it completely. There is no ques- 
tion here of real failure of memory, of any pretending 
on the part of the subject; it is a question of a partic- 
ular modification of consciousness that I tried to de- 
scribe in 1889 under the name of subconsciousness 
through disintegration. This dissociation, this migra- 
tion of certain psychological phenomena into a special 
group, seemed to me connected with the exhaustion 
brought on by various causes, and in particular by 
emotion. I have been led to suppose that in cases of 
this sort there was a certain relation between this dis- 
sociation of memories and the seriousness of the dis- 
orders that these memories brought about after they 
had become subconscious. A fixed idea seemed dan- 
gerous because it was apart from the personality, 
because it belonged to a group of phenomena over 
which the conscious will of the subject had no longer 
any control. 
This supposition found its justification in some at- 
tempts at treatment: all the processes that altered that 
abnormal form of memory altered in the same degree 
the hysterical accidents. When one could bring the 
subject to express his memories, even during waking 
consciousness, he was freed from his delirium and the 
disorders connected with these memories. 
These observations and these effective treatments 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 41 
led me to formulate some plans of procedure relating 
to the “psychological treatment of hysteria.” When 
a patient showed certain accidents that might well be 
related to traumatic memories, it was well to encourage 
him to describe clearly the memories of various periods 
of his life, and when gestures, attitudes, disorders or 
reticences made us suspect a gap, it was necessary 
to find out whether dreams, somnambulism, automatic 
writing would not bring to light other memories more 
deeply hidden. But I had in mind only certain special 
cases and, although I advised the search for subcon- 
scious memories in these cases, I believed it necessary 
to guard against discovering such memories where they 
did not exist, and I gave some rules for prudent 
diagnosis. 
At this time a foreign physician, Dr. S. Freud of 
Vienna, came to Salpétriére and became interested in 
these studies. He granted the truth of the facts and 
published some new observations of the same kind. 
In these publications he changed first of all the terms 
that I was using; what I had called psychological 
analysis he called psychoanalysis; what I had called 
psychological system, in order to designate that totality 
of facts of consciousness and movement, whether of 
members or of viscera, whose association constitutes 
the traumatic memory, he called complex; he consid- 
ered a repression what I considered a restriction of con- 
sciousness; what I referred to as a psychological dis- 
sociation, or as a moral fumigation, he baptized with 
the name of catharsis. But above all he transformed 
a clinical observation and a therapeutic treatment with
-P-A-G-E-50
  42 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
a definite and limited field of use into an enormous 
system of medical philosophy. 
In this system, all neuropathic disorders result from 
some traumatic memory concealed in the subconscious, 
and every treatment demands the search for such mem- 
ories. The method of free association that makes pos- 
sible this search consists in asking the patient to take 
an easy position, to forget that the physician is behind 
him, to give himself up to all the vague thoughts that 
rise spontaneously in his mind, and to express them as 
if he were alone. “He should not let himself be stopped 
by any unexpected thought, nor by an idea that seems 
to him futile, nor by an image or a word that is drole, 
fantastic, or indecent; he must banish all reticence 
and give over his passive imagination to the flow of 
ideas and images. . . . The physician should observe 
his subject with the most careful attention, taking note 
not only of the ideas expressed, but even of the slight- 
est details that he can catch, hesitation, embarrass- 
ment, lapses, sighs, gestures, facial expressions. ... ” 7 
The physician must add to the results of the observa- 
tion of these reveries all the memories of dreams that 
the patient can recover, all the memories that the 
patient has conserved from the earliest infancy. 
All these details should next be interpreted in such 
a way as to find back of them the more or less dis- 
guised memory of an exciting event. The question 
is always one of an emotion, of a tendency, of a desire 
that has been momentarily roused by circumstances 
‘EK. Régis and A. Hesnard, La Psychoanalyse des névroses et des 
psychoses, 1914, p. 182.
-P-A-G-E-51
  CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 43 
and then crowded back into the subconscious by an 
effort of the moral will. This repression, which is fun- 
damental in this doctrine, has transformed the prim- 
itive tendency, has rendered it subconscious or unintel- 
ligible, and has forced it to present itself in the form 
of bizarre dreams or of mysterious neuropathic acci- © 
dents. 
The traumatic memories that are recovered in this 
fashion always have the same content; it is always a 
question of traumatic memories related to sexual ad- 
ventures, or, if one likes, of traumatic memories with 
a sexual content. Instead of agreeing with all the 
preceding observers that one finds memories of this 
sort in some neuropaths, psychoanalysis asserts, and 
therein lies its originality, that one finds such mem- 
ories in all neuropaths without exception. Without 
such adventures transformed into traumatic memories 
there are no neuroses. If they are not readily estab- 
lished in all patients, it is because one has not known 
how to make the patient acknowledge them, or has 
not known how to discover them hidden behind his 
reticence. The most extraordinary and sometimes the 
most extravagant interpretations of attitudes, words, 
and especially of dreams, have no other object than 
to discover, at all costs, striking memories of this sort 
in the subconscious. 
The critics have often been astonished at the sin- 
gular doctrines of “Pansexuality” that have resulted 
from some medical analyses. The importance attrib- 
uted to sexual events is the logical result, if I am not 
mistaken, of the nature of Mr. Freud’s first studies. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
As we have seen, that author has attempted to trans- 
form in an original fashion the conceptions of psycho- 
logical analysis concerning traumatic memories and 
the subconscious by generalizing them beyond all rea- 
son. When one has decided to uncover in every neuro- 
path a memory of an emotional adventure, capable of 
disorganizing consciousness, when one admits a priori 
that this memory will be always more or less repressed, 
disguised in symbols and metaphors, and that it will 
never be exposed by the patient except with reticence 
and effort, one reaches rather inevitably a disclosure 
of intimate affairs. In our civilization the events that 
have most often caused emotion, however slight or 
intense, the facts about which men and women do not 
ordinarily care to speak freely, that they express by 
allusions, and with latin words that defy decency, 
such are always the adventures of the sexual life. The 
way in which M. Freud had understood the traumatic 
memory and fixed subconscious ideas has led him to 
attribute this great importance to sexual adventures 
described with half phrases. It is not surprising that 
he should have brought into this study his ingenious 
method of interpretation and of bold generalization. 
However that may be, this sexual interpretation of 
nervous disorders is becoming the foundation of all 
pathology: the various neuroses, and even the mental 
diseases, such as dementia precox, all have a sexual 
origin. They take different forms according to the 
nature of the sexual processes in early infancy. This 
conception is soon inordinately extended: all the facts 
of normal psychology must be explained in the same
-P-A-G-E-53
  CURES DERIVED FROM MAGNETISM 45 
way because all psychology rests on an aggrandized 
notion of the sexual instinct. This same interpretation 
must be applied to legal diagnosis, to the psychology 
of religion, to literature, to pedagogy, to esthetics, and 
so on. Psychoanalysis becomes, as MM. Régis and 
Hesnard asserted, “a vast system of explanation for 
most of the forms of human psychic activity through 
the analysis of affective tendencies considered for the 
most part as derivatives of the sexual instinct.” ® 
This strange and paradoxical doctrine, that is, how- 
ever, not without its grandeur, has been built up little 
by little by Professor S. Freud in a series of works 
published since 1893; but, above all, it has been devel- 
oped in many various ways by a great number of 
pupils, among whom I shall mention Ricklin, Ferencsi; 
Adler, Gross, Jones, Rank, Stekel, Bleuler, Jung and 
Maeder, who have founded numerous reviews of psy- 
choanalysis. Doubtless not all these disciples accept 
the ideas of the master in their entirety, and already 
several different tendencies are preparing the way for 
inevitable schisms. But, nevertheless, psychoanalysis 
has spread not only in Austria, but also into Switzer- 
land, into England, and into the United States. 
To-day, it is bringing about a great movement in psy- 
chology and medicine quite like that which invaded 
all countries when hypnotism was at its height. 
It is interesting to note that we are again concerned 
with a psychotherapeutic method whose roots extend

into the French animal magnetism. Psychoanalysis 
is to-day the last incarnation of those practices at once 
magical and psychological that characterized magnet- 
ism. It maintains the same characteristics, the use of 
imagination and the lack of criticism, the vaulting am- 
bition, the contagious fascination, the struggle against 
orthodox science. It is probable that it will also meet 
with undeserved appreciation and decline; but, like 
magnetism and hypnotism, it will have played a great 
réle and will have given a useful impulse to the study 
of psychology.

  CHAPTER IIT 
THERAPIES DERIVED FROM RELIGIOUS 
PRACTICES 
Medicine has had its origin in religion as well as 
magic and psychological medicine offers us many prac- 
tices that are to-day non-religious and are used by 
physicians in hospitals, but that were in other days 
religious methods used by the superiors of convents 
for the guidance of souls. The acknowledged excel- 
lence of these methods has brought about an extension 
of their use. 
1. ISOLATION HOMES 
Isolation from the society of men has the appearance 
of a great misfortune, and many literary descriptions 
have dealt with the suffering it causes. Isolation must, 
however, have some justification and even some attrac- 
tion, since we see it practised in several forms by vari- 
ous religions. In Hindu or Egyptian religion, and more 
particularly in Christianity, we find men who retire 
from the society of their fellows to live in the desert, 
in the forest, or in caves, in a state of isolation more 
or less complete: they are given the name of monk, 
povdcs, one who lives alone. Some of them, hermits, 
recluses, anchorites, used to live in grottoes or cells, 
quite isolated, but more often isolation was limited 
47 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  48 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
in such a fashion as to keep its advantages without 
its inconveniences. Men who wished to isolate them- 
selves joined together to keep the advantages of a 
division of labor and to exclude from the group only 
those things of which they wished to be rid. This was, 
in spite of the contradiction in terms, a society of 
persons living alone. Thus were formed the innumer- 
able convents of ancient India; whole convents were 
chiseled out of the mountains, and decorated with 
countless sculptures made in the living rock. In the 
third century of the Christian era, love of solitude 
spread like an epidemic, and great monastic orders 
were founded everywhere. 
The first reason for these practices was religious: 
men believed they were depriving themselves of 
numerous pleasures and imposing on themselves meri- 
torious suffering in retiring from the world. At the 
same time, they hoped to be less distracted by worldly 
turmoil and to be able more effectively to consecrate 
themselves to meditation and to prayer. It is prob- 
able that many persons appreciated and made known 
other satisfactions and other benefits of a life of re- 
treat and meditation, for we soon find the monastic 
life attracting many people, especially the weak, and 
those whom life had defeated, with an attraction not 
wholly attributable to asceticism. 
Later on, even laymen sought to profit from the 
benefits of this religious isolation, and in the seven- 
teenth century we see the solitaries of Port Royal 
quitting the world and practising a comparative isola- 
tion whose charms several of them have celebrated.
-P-A-G-E-57
  THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 49 
Medical practice had likewise organized hospitals 
in which certain sick persons were isolated: lazar 
houses, and mad houses had been in existence for a 
long time, but this isolation was imposed on the suf- 
ferers as a protection against them and there was no 
thought of the interests of the insane when they were 
placed under lock and key. It is this first organization 
of prisons for the insane that gave rise to the prejudice 
against medical establishments of isolation that persists 
even to-day. 
It was only at a comparatively recent time that 
physicians, more or less consciously, taught by the 
example of the convents, came to appreciate the calm 
and satisfaction that a life of isolation secures and 
began to use this method of treatment for some of 
their patients. Jean Weyer, 1579, Paulin, Zimmer- 
man, 1788, Cullen and Willis, 1772-1840, advised cures 
by isolation. Philippe Pinel, 1745-1826, organized 
this treatment in his famous reform of the hospitals 
in which the insane were confined. “It is necessary,” 
he said, “to isolate the patient from his family, from 
his friends, to remove from him all those whose inju- 
dicious affection might bring on a condition of constant 
excitement or even aggravate the danger: in other 
words, it is necessary to change the moral atmosphere 
in which the insane must live.’ When Pinel was 
beginning his reform of the treatment of the insane, a 
like reform was under way in England, in the creation 
of a hospital called “the Retreat of York,” which under 
the direction of William Tuke became the point of 
departure and the model for all English asylums. 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
  50 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
Esquirol, 1772-1840, continued the work of Pinel in 
France. In his memoir of 1822, he advises isolation 
for all the insane, remarking that many kinds of suf- 
fering are thus spared them and a treatment made 
effective that would be impossible in their family. It 
was at this time that there were founded everywhere 
in France those fine hospitals in their great parks that 
have earned a merited renown. 
At first this treatment by isolation was applied only 
to the insane proper, although Briquet was already 
foreseeing a change of surroundings in the treatment of 
hysteria. Weir Mitchell and Playfair in America, 
Charcot in France, Burkart in Germany taught that 
it was advantageous to give other patients the benefit 
of this treatment and applied it to various neuroses, 
to hysteria and to neurasthenia. Thus there were 
organized at this time in various countries hospitals 
of another sort, no longer adapted to the insane proper, 
but to those half-insane who were being treated under 
the name of neuropaths. 
A somewhat curious variation of Charcot’s treat- 
ment was organized at Salpétriére in 1895 by Déjerine, 
who thought to isolate his patients more thoroughly 
by completely separating them from each other and 
forcing them to a long period of rest in beds sur- 
rounded by lowered curtains. In general, however, the 
isolation of patients in sanatoriums is not so strict: 
the patient is only separated from his family, whom, 
however, he continues to see from time to time, and 
he is more or less with the other patients and the per- 
sonnel of the hospital. It is mainly a question of a
-P-A-G-E-59
  THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 51 
change of surroundings and of location in an artificial 
environment. However different its forms, the treat- 
ment by isolation is applied more and more to neuro- 
paths as well as to the insane. 
2. RepucaTion 
Education always played a large part in religious 
and monastic institutions; it was applied not only to 
children, but also to adults who had to acquire good 
habits. Since education transformed an individual and 
made him capable of new actions, there was all the 
more reason for it to be able to reéstablish functions 
that the patient had formerly possessed but had lost 
through illness. 
Attempts at treatment by the reéducation of the 
patient are really very ancient. M. Kouindjy cites 
from Father Amyot some methods formerly used in 
China to reéducate movements of members in para- 
lyzed patients. In the seventeenth century there was 
made in France an attempt to cure paralyses by gym- 
nastic exercises. Magnetists and physicians such as 
Laisné in 1854 and Blache in 1864 speak of the réle of 
rhythmic motion in the treatment of chorea. Finally, 
among the forerunners of the educative treatment of 
neuropaths must be placed the numerous physicians 
and teachers who devoted themselves to the treatment 
of children presenting defects of pronunciation, and 
stammering in particular. 
The notion of applying educational processes to 
pathological disorders seems to have gained importance 
as a result of the work of Seguin, 1837-1846, and of 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
those who interested themselves in the treatment of 
idiots and retarded children. Since such education of 
abnormal individuals had given very interesting re- 
sults, it seemed feasible to apply like methods to other 
sufferers whose disorders, though less serious, seemed 
to be likewise of a psychological nature. 
It seems to me that credit should be given to Char- 
cot’s teaching for an interesting systematization of 
these methods of treatment of neuropaths, the institu- 
tion of a regular treatment for hysterical paralyses by 
the reéducation of movement. At the same period 
some processes of the same kind were applied to the 
treatment of mutism and hysterical aphonia. The 
patient was trained to give the closest attention to the 
sounds that he was trying to hear and that he was 
forcing himself to reproduce. Finally, one might con- 
sider, at least in certain cases, the treatment applied 
to what was called hysterical anorexia as an education 
of the function of nourishment. 
A second epoch in the history of treatments by re- 
education seems to me to be characterized by the appli- 
cation of such treatment to paralyses and to disorders 
of movement of an organic origin, especially to the dis- 
orders of movement brought about by tabes. In the 
beginning this was the work of Leyden and Frankel, 
who tried to enable the tabetic to walk more normally 
by teaching him to direct his movements in a new 
fashion, through visual sensations instead of kin- 
esthetic. These methods, originally applied to tabes, 
have been little by little extended, and have been ap- 
plied to paraplegias and to cases of organic hemiplegia. 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 53 
Several authors have described interesting experiments 
in patients suffering from aphasia. 
In a third period these educative treatments were 
applied to various disorders of movement presented by 
certain neuropaths who were not suffering from hys- 
teria proper, more often to motor troubles and in par- 
ticular to the tics of psychasthenics. I, myself, in 
1889 pointed out the réle played by automatisms in 
the tics so often presented by such patients and the 
educational methods that might alter the abnormal 
motor tendency. In his “association neuroses” Dr. 
Morton Prince insisted on these abnormal associations 
of movements which he called neurograms: later on 
he compared them to the artificial associations pro- 
duced in dogs in the experiments of Mr. Pavolow. 
For Dr. M. Prince the treatment consisted in dissolv- 
ing these artificial complexes by a training, the oppo- 
site of that which had formed them. Psychologists, 
moreover, like M. Payot, insisted on that law of mem- 
ory according to which every reminiscence that is not 
refreshed from time to time has a tendency to become 
less distinct and to disappear. Now to a certain extent 
we are able to encourage or discourage the reproduc- 
tion of movements and of thoughts and thus are able 
to condemn to death a memory or a motor tendency 
by refusing to exercise it. Those various elements were 
the constituents of an interesting attempt at the treat- 
ment of tics. 
Formerly, physicians never tried to cure tics, which 
they carelessly thought to be either insignificant or in- 
curable. Treatment of tics by reéducation began with
-P-A-G-E-62
    
54 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
Jolly in 1830, and Blache in 1854. These methods were 
studied and clarified by Buissaud and his pupils, who 
established the principle of treatment by the discipline 
of immobility and of movement. An interesting appli- 
cation of these methods was made in the treatment of 
occupational cramps, in particular writers’ cramp, 
which is so often a variety of psychasthenic tic. The 
close relationship between tics and the different kinds 
of stammering has led to the application to the former 
of the methods used in the treatment of the latter. 
M. Pitres has proposed a method of treatment of tics 
by the regulation of respiration. 
Such breathing exercises rapidly became indepen- 
dent of all treatment of speech and have proved to be 
ends in themselves. The leaders of Swedish gymnastics, 
Ling in particular, had already shown the importance 
of methodical respiratory gymnastics and had formu- 
lated rules for them. These extensive and deep respira- 
tory movements bring about a more active ventilation 
and a complete elimination of waste products: they 
have a great effect on general health and perhaps even 
on mental activity, and should be more often used in 
the general treatment of neuroses. Such breathing ex- 
ercises become still more important when the neuro- 
pathic disorders involve more particularly the respira- 
tory functions. I have already shown, on several occa- 
sions, that respiratory gymnastics have an effect not 
only on hysterical mutism, but also on the coughs, the 
yawning, the sniffing, the sighs, the hiccoughs, so com- 
mon among neuropaths. This period saw also an ex- 
tended application of the educative treatment of eating
-P-A-G-E-63
  
THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 55 
habits, which had at first been used only in hysterical 
anorexia. M. Dubois of Berne, recalling the studies 
of Barras (Traité sur les gastralgies, enteralgies, ou 
maladies nerveuses de V’estomac et de lV’intestin, Paris, 
1820), maintained that a great many stomach dis- 
orders are connected with bad habits, with emotional 
disorders and various neuroses, and he insisted on the 
importance of a dietary training that should not con- 
sider the fears, or prejudices, or bad habits of the 
patient. In Parker’s Psychotherapy, Dr. R. C. Cabot 
ingeniously classifies this cure among the treatments 
by work: “an individual who suffers or thinks he is 
suffering with stomach trouble reduces his diet, and I 
find him dying of hunger: I advised him to eat in spite 
of everything and his health is completely reéstab- 
lished. This is the stomach’s “work cure”: it is work 
that develops the stomach, intestines and sexual organs 
as well as the brain.” 
Reéducation has, however, been again extended in 
a much broader fashion, in attempting to go beyond 
the treatment of strictly motor disorders to reach dis- 
orders of a more definitely mental character. The lat- 
ter were at first only approached through the inter- 
mediary of motor disorders themselves. The patients 
whose most apparent symptoms consist in phobias, 
obsessions and delirium and who do not attract atten- 
tion by difficulties of movement, display, nevertheless, 
many disorders in their movements. 
Is it not probable that a change brought about in 
these movements by education would react on the total 
activity and would prevent or suppress mental dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  56 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
orders? This is what I had already suggested in my 
book on obsessions in 1908, in advising that a child 
predisposed to mental disorder be habituated to move- 
ment, which is one of the greatest foes of brooding. 
“He should,” I said, “take much physical exercise of 
all kinds. Such exercise should be directed and should 
demand skill, for it is essential to develop in him a 
precision in physical movements. The over-scrupulous 
are fearfully awkward, and can handle nothing and 
manage nothing. These children should be accustomed 
from early infancy to use their hands, to perform man- 
ual tasks, to work in the earth, with wood, with paper, 
to cultivate plants, to construct objects, and to busy 
themselves with the real world.” These ideas have 
been adopted by those interested in gymnastic treat- 
ments, but without much precision. 
I believe that the growth of this idea has been one 
of the most curious characteristics of the therapeutic 
movement that has developed in America in opposition 
to Christian Science under the name of “New 
Thought.” Most of the authors of this school seek 
to change the mental state of neuropaths by educa- 
tion of the movements of their members and by sup- 
pression of all the minor motor disorders that char- 
acterize these patients. One of them advises perform- 
ing several times a day the following exercise: “Walk, 
holding a glass full of water straight out before you, 
without spilling a drop.” This requires learning to 
watch tremors and involuntary movements. One 
should read without permitting any lip movement 
or tongue movement during the reading. One should
-P-A-G-E-65
  THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 57 
practise the slow opening of the fingers, one by 
one, close them slowly, and continue this exercise 
for ten minutes in such a way as to watch care- 
fully the extension and contraction of the fingers. An- 
other writer insists on exercises for the strength of 
visual attention: “One should practice gazing with 
intensity at a black point on white paper, maintain 
this gaze for one minute, arrive at an ability to main- 
tain it for fifteen minutes, and change the direction 
of gaze and maintain this new direction . . . stare 
fixedly at one’s self in a mirror in order to grow accus- 
tomed: to enduring the gaze of another; stare reso- 
lutely at people, and if it is impossible at once to 
meet their eyes, stare at an imaginary point at the 
base of their nose . . . remember that the energetic 
man always gives the impression of being in repose; 
he is not nervous, he does not fidget, feeling that he 
has in himself reserve force!” 
There is no point in enumerating all these exercises, 
which are all of the same sort and have the same 
general character. They indicate the same therapeutic 
direction: there is always involved a training of the 
external attitude in order to arrive by that means at 
a change of the mental attitude. 
Beyond this first group must be placed a great num- 
ber of bolder and decidedly more important therapists. 
Since mental disorders must be reduced by education, 
it is necessary to attack them directly and to under- 
take the education, not of bodily movements, but of 
movements of the mind. The mind itself must be 
given exercise and there must be developed by mental
-P-A-G-E-66
  58 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
gymnastics the faculties that seem to us lacking in 
the subject and that will allow him to struggle against 
his affliction. Dr. Morton Prince is one of the first 
who, in speaking of the treatment of neuropaths, has 
repeatedly used the word education. He criticizes 
justly the “rest cure” of Weir Mitchell when it is used 
in an exaggerated form and without mental influence. 
The method that he himself prefers to use is primarily 
a reéducation of character: “To accomplish this it is 
necessary to change the beliefs of patients, to rid them 
of apprehension, and to destroy the deplorable habit 
of thinking every disagreeable sensation the sign of a 
serious and irreparable lesion: it is necessary to accus- 
tom them to control and suppress their emotional 
states, and here there must be called in all the tact and 
individual character of the physician!” Finally, it is 
necessary to train the patient to perform as many 
actions as can be performed without accidents. 
The majority of these studies on reéducation are 
rather vague and seem to bear on all the functions 
of the mind indiscriminately. Others seem somewhat 
more precise, and attempt an application to certain 
preferred faculties. Several authors, for instance, 
are preoccupied with the tendency of the mind to 
emotion exaggerated by what they call emotivity, 
which plays a great part in many troubles, and they 
consider the resistance to emotion as a sort of function 
that one can develop by gymnastics. 
Oppenheim, in his medical letters written some time 
ago, and in his recent articles, advises the beginning in 
infancy of the cultivation of the ability to control both
-P-A-G-E-67
THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 59 
emotions and passions. His ideas seem to me to con- 
stitute the essential part of many works in which neu- 
roses are considered as the somehow fatal consequences 
of an omission or error in early education. 
Just as the preceding authors concerned themselves 
with education of the emotions, others proposed the 
problem of the education of attention. They showed 
that in mental work as in all other forms of work there 
is a considerable part of habit that must be developed 
and on which it is necessary to rely, the conclusion 
being to suggest mental work to the patient as a 
method of cure. But this is already taking us into a 
study of psychological therapy that I consider some- 
what different from education properly so-called. 
Gymnastic methods have little by little raised their 
pretensions and departing from the treatment of ele- 
mentary disorders of movement have attacked the 
disorders of the highest functions. 
3. USE OF MORALE IN MEDICINE 
We may include under the heading “Morale Thera- 
pies” a group of schools that developed in Europe and 
in America at the beginning of this century and that 
had as a common characteristic the treatment of suf- 
ferers by reasoning and moral exhortation. The most 
complete expression of these doctrines, even in their 
exaggeration, seems to me to be found in the works 
of a Swiss physician, Dubois (of Berne), les psycho- 
névroses et leur traitement moral, 1904, and L’educa- 
tion de soi-méme, 1909. 
This therapy includes first a negative part, for Du- 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
bois is severe toward most of the usual treatments. 
The various forms of surgical interference in abdomi- 
nal affections or in diseases of the sense organs seem 
to him usually exaggerated and mistaken. The prac- 
tice of hydrotherapy, so much abused, finds no mercy 
at his hands. Massage, subcutaneous injections, treat- 
ments by organ extract, all this he treats as charlatan- 
ism. “We must do away with all that and approach 
the disease without weapons and without medicines, 
giving the patient added conviction that there is 
no danger, something that is of extreme importance. 
The only weapon should be the influential word.” 
We are then reduced to moral treatments alone, but 
even among them it is necessary to make exceptions. 
Miraculous treatments like those of Lourdes, are, of 
course, held in derision. But, above all, the most 
severe criticism is directed against hypnotism and sug- 
gestion. The essential of the treatment consists “in 
an intimate and daily conversation, which is worth 
more to the patient than douches and chloral... . 
The real physician does more good by his talk than by 
his prescriptions . . . moreover he should restrict 
himself to sitting beside the patient to cure him by 
edifying conversation.” It is curious to note the simi- 
larity of these opinions to those of P. P. Quimby and 
Mrs. Eddy. 
What is to be the object of these conversations? 
“Their chief object is always reason and truth.” But 
again, what truth are we going to tell the patient? 
“The truth about his disease that he must understand. 
This is very important, for he comes with wrong ideas
-P-A-G-E-69
  THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 61 
of the disorders from which he suffers. . . . It is neces- 
sary to show him his mistake by a long and untiring 
discussion. Neither his stomach, nor his intestines, 
nor his brain, have really any lesion. The troubles that 
he has noticed are simply functional disorders. They 
are not in themselves either grave or important. The 
essential thing is to disregard them and never to speak 
of pains or uncomfortable sensations.” Are not the 
mental disorders at least, from which these patients 
suffer, more serious? Not at all, “these are not real 
sorrows that trouble their souls, they are nothing, small 
annoyances, the pin pricks of life. A little easily 
taught philosophy is enough to reéstablish the mental 
equilibrium.” 
Let us take as an example the feeling of fatigue of 
which the nervous regularly complain. It is evident 
that the problem of the exhaustion of neuropaths that 
appears to me so complicated is, to the eyes of M. 
Dubois, on the contrary, astonishingly simple. “The 
question is one only of false fatigue, convictions of 
fatigue and not of real fatigue.” At bottom there is 
nothing real in all these diseases beyond the false ideas 
themselves. The poor man “is in error,” like the pa- 
tients of Mrs. Eddy. 
These are the notions that must be put into the 
patient’s head. This will be attained first by our atti- 
tude toward the symptoms, which are not going to be 
taken seriously, and are not to be treated, and sec- 
ondly, by persuasive discussion. “Persuasion by 
logical means is a true magic wand.” While this medi- 
cal and psychological discussion is being pursued, it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
    62 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
necessary to arouse in the patient’s mind the idea of 
the cure. Doubtless it may seem bizarre to speak of 
cure to an individual when one began by proving to 
him he had no disease. But one may grant, like Mrs. 
Eddy, that he had an illusion of the disease and that 
he should be cured of that illusion. It is necessary to 
inculcate in him the fixed idea that he will recover. 
It is necessary to maintain the fixity of this idea up to 
the time of the complete cure. 
To avoid harmful questions, the neuropath’s absurd 
ideas must be replaced with high philosophical 
thoughts. The patient must be made to understand 
“the importance of thought, the power of his soul, the 
superiority of mind over body. Morale is indispensable 
for these patients. It alone can bring about a pro- 
found change in their mentality.” The little book on 
self-education contains fine pages on tolerance, indul- 
gence, moderation, pity and good will. These excellent 
sermons written for certain types of sick persons would 
be perhaps, to my notion, still more useful for persons 
in good health. Dubois insists on reasoning, but he 
always includes the action of all the sentiments. He 
would have us make known to the sufferer all that he 
has within him that is fine and good, obtain his confi- 
dence, “surround him with a sympathy so lively, so 
enveloping that he would really be ungracious not to 
recover.” 
In my more complete historical study, I showed that 
in Germany and in Switzerland numerous authors were 
at that time giving expression to notions of this kind. 
I recall only the excellent advice of A. Forel. “If you
-P-A-G-E-71
    THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 63 
wish to attain the happiest possible old age, it is neces- 
sary first never to lose your optimism; secondly, never 
to lose your time in brooding on the past or mourning 
your dead; thirdly, to work up to your last breath in 
order to preserve the elasticity of your cerebral activ- 
ity.” We recognize in these works the same inspira- 
tion; health and happiness are again obtained by a 
“hygiene of the soul,” by the development of intelli- 
gence and by the exercise of moral virtues. 
French writers, such as Déjerine, have been the im- 
mediate disciples of the Professor of Berne and have 
done no more than reproduce his doctrine word for 
word with insignificant changes. What is more curi- 
ous, the majority of those authors who took up hypno- 
tism with enthusiasm have foresworn it and turned 
with the same enthusiasm to this new moral medicine. 
M. Bernheim himself now repeats that suggestion is 
nothing and that he never intended to perform more 
than persuasion. At a recent period, every fashion- 
able treatment had to be performed by rational educa- 
tion. 
It is again to the United States that we must turn 
to find a more original development of the method of 
moral treatment. Mrs. Eddy had wished to monop- 
olize for herself alone the ideas of P. P. Quimby on 
moral treatment. But several disciples of Quimby 
had preserved and developed this teaching without 
following in the wake of Mrs. Eddy. The works of 
W. T. Evans, of J. A. Dresser, and of M. Wood, be- 
came the origin of the “New Thought” movement and 
of its numerous variations. More recently, this form
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
of psychotherapy has taken on a considerably greater 
development in America as the result of a somewhat 
unexpected event, the alliance that was established 
between the representatives of religion and those of 
medicine. Mrs. Eddy has waked the pastors and the 
physicians from their inertia and from their dogmatic 
slumber. The incredible development of “Christian 
Science” encroached on the established churches 
which it was robbing of devotees and on the official 
physicians whose patients it was stealing. Fear of 
the common enemy makes the most unexpected alli- 
ances. 
In October, 1906, Dr. Elwood Worcester and Dr. 
Samuel McComb, rector of Emmanuel Church, an 
Episcopalian church of Boston, organized what they 
call the “Emmanuel Church Health Class,” intended 
for the treatment of nervous disorders. What is orig- 
inal in the attempt of the Boston Church is that the 
treatment of diseases practiced by the clergy in the 
temples, for the first time ceases to be opposed to the 
therapy of physicians decorated with official diplomas. 
The Emmanuel movement presents itself as an asso- 
ciation of pastors and physicians. This characteristic 
is well shown in the official rules of procedure drawn 
up by a committee on which were found four physi- 
cians, and in the active collaboration of the physicians 
who even consented to speak in the churches. 
This movement lost no time in its development. 
From Emmanuel Church of Boston it reached a large 
number of other cities; some important books were 
published in various places. In this movement we find
-P-A-G-E-73
THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 65 
a constant attention paid to the removal of the exag- 
gerations that brought about the ridicule of Christian 
Science: we find here also, more than in the work of 
Dubois, a greater interest in the studies of psycholo- 
gists, educators and criminologists. A special feature 
of this school is the considerable part of its treat- 
ment that is devoted to religious exercises. “Weekly 
services, meetings, prayers, hymns sung in common, 
are very fruitful exercises. .. . The highest form of 
religious activity is prayer, which serves not only to 
obtain benefits from God, but which plays a great réle 
in itself... . . Religious prayer brings peace and cures 
anxiety.” 
In spite of their efforts to be different, these psycho- 
therapeutic theories offer a curious likeness to those 
of Mrs. Eddy. They start with the same idea, more 
or less acknowledged, that the disease is an error or 
a fault and that one can escape it through instruction 
or moral training. There is the same denial of evil: 
Mrs. Eddy says that the body does not exist and Du- 
bois repeats that the bodily lesion does not exist. The 
denial is no more logical in one case than in the 
other, for if my body does not exist, why must I suffer, 
and if I have no disease, why am IJ an invalid, and 
why must I be treated? There is the same directing 
of attention toward the mind and high conduct. The 
work of many of the moralizers seems to be Mrs. 
Eddy’s book secularized. 
There are, however, important differences: Christian 
Science pretends to cure everything and makes no dis- 
tinction of malady: the moralizers, though they have 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  66 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
a very vague notion of the psycho-neuroses, attack 
only certain special diseases in which the ideas of the 
sufferer are of real importance. The errors of which 
Christian Science speaks are philosophical errors of 
doubtful importance; the errors that the moralizers 
discuss are errors of conduct and of belief that can be 
more easily changed and whose change can have more 
intelligible effects. Mrs. Eddy’s idealism is only a 
means toward the suppression of matter: the generous 
and noble acts that Dubois (of Berne) requires, de- 
mand attention and effort and should really develop 
mental power. It is not alone a question of true think- 
ing; it is a question of good thinking. Moral good is 
added to philosophical truth. 
But above all there is here a great progress in the 
interpretation of the mysterious power that was acting 
in the miracles, unknown to the early operators and 
their patients. Mrs. Eddy knows that it is a question 
of a power that resides in the mind, but she does not 
reveal this power. The patients she treats can take her 
metaphysics seriously and imagine that a miraculous 
power is involved. The patients of Dubois can not 
make the same error, for he explains perfectly to them 
the forces that he is going to put to work. 
Doubtless we find in both doctrines the influence 
of animal magnetism. The horror that Dubois feels 
toward hypnotism and Mrs. Eddy’s rages against ma- 
licious magnetism have the same origin. The moral- 
izers, however, have added to magnetism the true feel- 
ing of religion and of morality. As often happens, 
it is the work that is apparently most secular that con-
-P-A-G-E-75
  THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 67 
tains the most religious feeling. Whatever may be the 
omissions and the errors that it is only too easy to find 
in the theories of these physician-moralists, their work 
should be mentioned with respect and sympathy, for 
these men who are of great scientific and ethical worth 
have undertaken a difficult task with conviction and 
impartiality and they have been responsible for great 
progress in psychotherapy. 
4, TREATMENTS BY FAITH AND WORKS 
Records may be found in all religions from early 
times on certain odd psychological phenomena that 
went by the names inspiration, faith, grace, conversion, 
illumination. Many religious practices, numerous 
gatherings, stirring ceremonies in the presence of a 
great crowd, reproductions of happy or tragic scenes, 
rites that intimately join the faithful to powerful gods, 
benedictions, discourse on the union with the divinity, 
all seem to have as their purpose the production of such 
psychological phenomena. The defenders of religions 
pointed with reason to the excellent effect of these 
practices on the faithful, who departed consoled and 
comforted. 
During many years the historians and philosophers 
who were engaged in the study of religion misunder- 
stood phenomena of this sort. They limited them- 
selves to criticizing rites and myths in themselves, and 
did not see that these beliefs, which were without 
objective truth, could have, in spite of their falsity, a 
remarkable psychological effect. It is only recently 
that the psychological side of these religious phenom-
-P-A-G-E-76
    68 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
ena has been brought to light. William James, in par- 
ticular, in his book on the “Varieties of Religious Expe- 
rience” and in his book on the “Energies of Men,” has 
placed much emphasis on the psychological power of 
these practices: he has shown the two essential phe- 
nomena that appear under these circumstances, the 
change of feelings which pass from sadness to joy and 
the change of conduct which leads the subjects, if 
not from vice to virtue, at least from a dull and 
monotonous life to a life that is healthier, larger and 
more courageous. 
Moralists and physicians have tried to take advan- 
tage of these psychological powers and we may group 
under the term cures by faith and works all those 
methods, sometimes vague and unreflecting and some- 
times more systematic, that try to cure the sufferer 
by encouragement and by effort. 
Many optimistic doctrines appeal to courage and 
to energy: the stoic ethics was founded on that confi- 
dence in human powers of which man often despairs 
too soon. “Thou art saved for the present,” said 
Luther, “if only thou consentest to believe it.’ The 
essential vice of our carnal nature, according to Wil- 
liam James, is fear, which is never worthy of respect. 
We have within us unknown energies, we are inti- 
mately joined to the divine principle. A mother who 
sees her child in danger finds in herself a strength of 
Hercules that she did not suspect. We find references 
to a treatment by work and effort in all the works of 
the French alienists of the last century. Moreover, it 
is not hard to find many allusions to the good effects
-P-A-G-E-77
  THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 69 
of excitement in all the works that deal with gymnas- 
tics and physical training. 
I may be permitted to recall here my own research 
on the reéducation of the will and of the attention. 
In my first observations the subjects, in spite of the 
elimination of the main fixed ideas, relapsed too easily. 
In order to arouse mental activity I tried to subject 
them to a sort of gymnastics of attention; the mental 
labor could not be obtained without stirring up much 
resistance, but interesting results appeared promptly, 
and I was able to offer such training as an essential 
procedure in the treatment of hysteria. 
Grasset distinguished an inferior psychotherapy and 
a superior psychotherapy. Without our knowing very 
well why, he also liked to call treatments by suggestion 
inferior treatments, which is childish; but he de- 
scribed very well under the term “superior psycho- 
therapy” an education that had for its aim “the 
culture, the growth, the perfection of the will, self-mas- 
tery, the moral unity of the self and of the person- 
ality.” At the same period there was developed an odd 
cure that has seldom been analyzed or discussed. This 
is the treatment of M. Vittoz of Lausanne which is at 
the same time connected with the preceding studies on 
the need for reéducating the attention and with the 
procedure of the disciples of American “New 
Thought.” 
All these French writings are well enough known. 
I should like to call particular attention to a group 
of small books, published, most of them, in America 
by the New Thought Company, that seem to me 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  70 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
worthy of attention. These works, whose appearance, 
it is true, is scarcely scientific, have a rather practical 
nature, and a lofty moral inspiration. Several have 
been translated into French. The titles of some of 
these books are a good indication of their character. 
“Happiness and Marriage,” “The Hygiene of the 
Brain,” “Treatise on Personal Cure,” “The Philosophy 
of Joy,” “The Will to be Well,” “The Power of Silence,” 
“What Are Your Powers? and How to Use Them,” 
“How to Live One Hundred Years and Be Happy.” 
The author of this last book advises us to keep before 
our eyes examples of happy longevity and to imagine 
that we feel ourselves younger every day: this advice 
is excellent but perhaps somewhat hard to follow. The 
author of a “Course of Viteopathy” assures us that 
many persons will be cured by encouraging them to 
live: that is simple and somewhat naive, but it is a 
good indication of the general nature of this medicine 
of encouragement. The author of a book on “The 
Thought Force, its Action and its Réle in Life,” begins 
thus: “This little book is planned to make known to 
everyone the secret forces that he contains. It will 
be a manual of energy. It will train the will. It will 
educate the character. . . .” 
To attain this power one should practice certain 
preparatory exercises: some consist in breathing exer- 
cises, others in meditation in solitude. But it is above 
all necessary to write in large letters, to learn by heart 
and repeat without pause certain important phrases 
on which one puts his mind on going to bed and on 
rising. I was astonished to note recently that these
-P-A-G-E-79
  THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 71 
little books have been read in Paris by some sufferers 
on the alert for anything that promised them that 
energy they lacked. Some women of the people who 
frequented the hospital put their trust in carrying 
about with them slips of paper on which were written 
in large letters the formulas that they repeated: “I’m 
strong, very strong; my will will be very strong before 
men and will be as nothing only before God; no one 
can resist my influence; I have decided to succeed; I 
am sure of success.” I should add, also, that these 
poor women were depressed and fearfully timid and 
succeeded in nothing. 
All the writers of this group present, may one say, 
the same defects and the same qualities. It is evident 
that they have much exaggeration and naiveté; they 
are inexact both as psychologists and as clinicians and 
they offer no records that permit one to verify their 
statements. But it is none the less true that they 
have a quite genuine feeling for those latent forces 
of which William James spoke and that they make an 
interesting appeal to psychological stimulation as the 
essential treatment for depression. 
In another direction we find, likewise in America, 
and quite independent, a whole group of physicians 
and psychologists of these different sects who have 
studied the same problems in a more scientific fashion. 
It will be possible to group these therapeutic direc- 
tions under the heading “Work Cure,” the work 
treatment proposed by Dr. R. C. Cabot, and to oppose 
them to the “rest cure” or treatment by repose, for- 
merly much esteemed in Philadelphia.
-P-A-G-E-80
    72 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
Dr. P. Coombs Knap of Boston had, in 1897, already 
established that the best way to cure workers affected 
with traumatic neuroses was to return them as soon 
as possible to their work, rather than having them rest 
indefinitely, as was too often the tendency. Like re- 
marks were made by several physicians who demand 
“a change in point of view, in mental attitude, an 
awakening of the ambitions that one may legitimately 
encourage, the search for the joyful emotion that de- 
velops after success and that offers a glimpse of a new 
life.” Dr. R. C. Cabot deserves to be considered one of 
the chief representatives of the “work cure” or treat- 
ment by work. “The neuropath’s unhealthy fears, his 
presumptions concerning his stomach, his gossip and 
his sexual lewdness come from not having enough to 
do. There is a period when boys need something 
dangerous to do; their life effervesces if we try to bot- 
tle them up. We see the degeneration of active men 
when they retire, and the rapid deterioration of health 
when they give up the work that is one of our natural 
supports.” 
We should not forget the great rdle played with so 
much authority by Prof. J. J. Putnam of Boston: he 
also demanded effort and work, for the best preventive 
of neuroses is a systematic education that teaches the 
distinction between true and false fatigue, that gives 
a correct estimate of our power; sacrifices, responsibil- 
ity, efforts at self-discipline, efforts at moral progress, 
give a more comprehensive view of life and lead to 
physical and moral health. Dr. Putnam tries to com- 
municate his own enthusiasm for philosophical studies;
-P-A-G-E-81
THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 73 
he would fight against materialistic and pessimistic 
doctrines; he would show that the scientific and philo- 
sophical notions of evolution are able to give us great 
hope. 
In spite of the obviously too vague character of 
many of their studies the authors have well demon- 
strated an idea that we have perhaps helped to estab- 
lish, namely, that neuropathic troubles depend on a 
fundamental change of activity. To be precise, it is 
not a question of a disorder of sensation, of memory, 
of reasoning, but of disorders of the integrating func- 
tions, of the apprehension of reality, of psychic tension. 
Here we may try to restore the highest functions by 
exercise, by directed work, by the exciting emotions. 
5. MORAL DIRECTION 
Religion long ago found moral guidance one of 
the most effective means for the support and relief 
of wavering humanity. Such direction has two char- 
acteristics: first, it is not a question of a quick process 
that once performed need not be renewed; it is a ques- 
tion of a slow and prolonged action, performed in a 
series of interviews that follow closely one on the 
other. In the second place this action has the best 
influence if it is performed by a particular individual 
who remains for a certain time the same. 
Religion has in the organization of monasteries al- 
ways given an important place to the person of the 
superior and to his regular influence. The Catholic 
religion has not restricted itself to instituting the con- 
fessional, but it has recommended that the devotee
-P-A-G-E-82
  74 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
keep the same confessor, and it has perfected the 
notion of the direction of conscience, the rdle of which 
had been already understood by the ancient stoic 
ethics. Ignatius Loyola, St. Francis de Sales, Bossuet, 
Fénelon, whose interesting letters I have already had 
occasion to quote, knew very well the importance of 
continuity in the treatment of those in moral difficul- 
ties, who were much better directed when they were 
in the hands of a confessor who had known them for 
a long time. 
In one of my old studies I analyzed the singular 
phenomenon that the magnetists named “magnetic 
rapport.” These forerunners of psychotherapy recog- 
nized the importance of the personal factor in the 
direction of their somnambulistic subjects, but they 
expressed it in an odd fashion by connecting it with 
their theories of fluids. They knew the phenomena 
of discrimination, that sensibiilty, that special obedi- 
ence that the subject displayed before the one who 
had often magnetized him, and they attributed it to a 
special fluid appertaining to the magnetist which had 
penetrated the subject. They formally prohibited the 
mixing of influences and fluids, and a good magnetist 
did not allow another person to make passes over his 
chosen subject. They knew by experience that in 
the treatment of these patients great difficulty was 
often encountered when it became necessary to change 
the usual magnetist of a subject impregnated by the 
predecessor’s fluid. We need not laugh too heartily 
at this naive language: we meet like facts to-day, 
though we express them differently.

  THERAPIES OF RELIGIOUS ORIGIN 75 
The moralizers who, like M. Dubois of Berne, seemed 
to grant importance only to reason and a training in a 
stoic morality were also making use of this personal 
influence when they advised the physician to keep in 
touch with his patient in order to understand him 
better and to develop by extensive visits the sympathy 
that is indispensable for the treatment. M. Déjerine 
repeated M. Dubois’ ideas in more precise fashion 
when he said: “For me, the foundation, the only ~ 
basis on which psychotherapy rests is the beneficial 
influence of one being on another!” 
In several of my preceding works, from 1896 to 1903, 
I insisted in various ways on the personal influence of 
the physician and on the réle it should play in the 
cure of nervous diseases: “It is necessary,” I said in 
that connection, “to convert into a recognized calling 
this direction, which was given formerly by the neigh- 
bors of the sufferer without recognizing it, or which 
was restricted to some religious persons. .. . It is one 
of the characteristics of our time that this moral guid- 
ance sometimes reverts to the physician when the suf- 
ferer does not find enough natural support about him.” 
Most of the contemporary writers concerned with 
these moral treatments have insisted on ideas of the 
same sort. Grasset would have the physician direct 
the whole life of the neuropath. He would even 
reach a true prophylaxis of neuroses by allowing the 
physician to superintend marriages and to direct 
unions and births in order to arrive at an organization 
of social defense against nervous diseases. Dr. Lewel- 
lys F. Barker, in his work, “On the Psychic Treatment
-P-A-G-E-84
  
  76 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
of the Functional Neuroses,” admits that the treat- 
ment is begun by a medical absolutism that leaves the 
patient no liberty. He hopes that in most cases the 
patient will be brought gradually to a certain amount 
of self-direction, but he does not hesitate to assert that 
in certain cases, medical direction should continue for 
life. It would be easy to multiply similar references, 
for this idea of the medical direction of neuropaths has 
been very generally admitted in the recent works on 
psychotherapy.

  CHAPTER IV 
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS 
A great number of therapies applied to disorders 
of conduct, make use of the physical or chemical prop- 
erties of certain drugs. The psychiatrists who employ 
them believe that they are only applying the teachings 
of physiology and disclaim any psychological treat- 
ment. In examining the general character of psycho- 
therapy we shall see that this interpretation is greatly 
exaggerated and that all treatment, even apparently 
physical, whose choice has been determined by psycho- 
logical considerations belongs to a great extent to 
psychotherapy. 
1, VISCERAL THEORIES OF NEUROSES AND INDIRECT 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT 
Psychological disorders are disorders of conduct and 
conduct is nothing more than the sum total of the 
external reactions of a living being. How can we 
admit that these external reactions that occur in the 
members, the mouth, the tongue, may be completely 
independent of the internal reactions that occur within 
the same body, the study of which constitutes physi- 
ology? Is not the successful adaptation of external 
reactions a part of life just as is the successful adapta- 
7
-P-A-G-E-86
  78 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
tion of internal reactions? A man whose conduct is 
deranged is a man who is living neither correctly nor 
completely: in the end, although appearances are 
sometimes otherwise, an insane person should always 
be considered sick. I am always astonished when I 
see an insane person, deranged from the age of twenty, 
attaining, nevertheless, an advanced age and present- 
ing even in old age the appearance of health. This is 
a complex problem obscured by our ignorance of the 
real length of human life, of the causes that lessen the 
normal duration of life, of vital activity, and we 
obviously deceive ourselves when we admire the ap- 
parent good health of these insane patients. 
It seems probable that all diseases, whatver they 
may be, must have an influence on psychic tension 
since this must depend on the proper functioning of 
the whole organism, and the ancients had already 
summed up this belief in the famous aphorism: Mens 
sana in corpore sano. Physicians have frequently ap- 
plied this axiom to the study of neuro-psychoses by a 
painstaking search into the patient’s organism for 
some pathological disorder to which might be assigned 
the apparent disorder of conduct. “In order to cure 
neuroses,” said Dr. Lewellys Barker, “much attention 
should be paid to local affections, ear troubles, eyes, 
errors of refraction, diseases of the sinuses, genito- 
urinary diseases, tuberculosis, arterio-sclerosis, syph- 
ilis, alcoholism, masked forms of Grave’s disease, etc.” 
The treatment of these various affections, when one is 
brought to undertake it by the examination of psycho- 
logical disorders, is doubtless an indirect, but very im-
-P-A-G-E-87
  PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS 79 
portant form of psychotherapy. There are some dis- 
eases, or if you prefer, some groups of physical symp- 
toms that seem to have a particular importance in the 
evolution of the neuroses, the treatment of which may 
well concern the psycho-therapist; we should place in 
the first rank gastro-intestinal disorders. 
It is incontestable that a great number of patients 
affected by various forms of mental depression have 
displayed or display at the same time disorders of nu- 
trition. A certain number of neuropaths do not eat 
sufficient food: formerly they were almost always 
classed under the name of hysterical anorexia; to-day 
this greatly confused group has been subdivided and, 
besides the truly hysterical disorders, a distinction has 
been made between the various obsessions, impulsions 
and deliriums relative to diet. In general, one should 
at the outset mistrust a restriction of food made by a 
neuropath on the pretext of a diet or a theory. Such 
restriction soon becomes exaggerated and leads to more 
and more serious restriction and refusal of nourish- 
ment. Still more often an excessive diet is to be 
observed in neuropaths. We have more often to deal 
with neuropaths who eat too much than with neuro- 
paths who eat too little. Disregarding those cases of 
pathological hunger whose obviously abnormal im- 
pulsions force them to eat all day long enormous 
quantities of food, we regularly see many patients who 
ordinarily consume at each meal an amount of food 
that is clearly greater than the normal and in particu- 
lar greater than the amount taken before they became 
ill. This common behavior is connected with the per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
a 
80 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
petual feeling of depression and with the instinct that 
causes us to connect weakness with hunger and to 
treat it by nourishment. The patients who eat too 
much are, in fact, the inert sort who suffer from feel- 
ings of incompleteness, while ordinarily the anorexic 
type of patient conceals depression under his excite- 
ment and even because of this excitement experiences 
very little feeling of incompleteness. We often see pa- 
tients, who, according to the phase of their malady, 
successively present the two opposite syndromes. 
Most of these patients, especially at the beginning 
of the disease, following upon an excess of nourish- 
ment, or even independently of disorders of diet, pre- 
sent difficulties of gastro-intestinal digestion. We find 
among them aches, “heart burn,” acid regurgitation, 
vomiting, excessive salivation that sometimes attain 
unheard-of proportions, or else we observe anorexia, 
aversions, slow digestion accompanied by flatulence, 
distension, constipation, dilation of the stomach, rum- 
bling, epigastric flutterings, ete. These symptoms are 
called, according to the case, hyperacidity, gastric hy- 
perasthenia, gastric insufficiency, gastric hyposthenia, 
gastric fermentation, gastro-intestinal ptoses, and, 
moreover, these symptoms mix, succeed each other, al- 
ternate the one with the other. They often bring in 
their train serious disorders of the stomach. 
Disorders of gastric digestion, loss of intestinal 
tonus, ptoses of the transverse colon, adhesions in con- 
nection with ptosis, often determine chronic constipa- 
tion. In a hundred records we find those disorders of 
intestinal digestion that have been known since the  
-P-A-G-E-89
  PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS 81 
studies of Maurice de Langenhagen under the name 
of mucomembranous enteritis. These gastro-intesti- 
nal diseases that so frequently accompany disorders of 
mental depression are developed under the same condi- 
tions as mental disorders after fatigue and emotion. 
The cure of these visceral symptoms often accom- 
panies the complete cure of the neuroses. Many of our 
patients no longer have any enteritis when they have 
no more obsessions. During the periods of temporary 
cure that we have called periods of stimulation, the 
functions of the stomach and intestine reéstablish 
themselves as well as those of the mind. 
All these records, which could be easily multiplied, 
have inspired a theory that may be called the gastro- 
intestinal theory of neuroses. Even without consider- 
ing the extreme cases of delirium from starvation and 
from loss of appetite, we may grant that insufficient 
nourishment is not without its effect on the develop- 
ment of a disease of weakness and hypertension. Con- 
versely, several authors have studied the ill effects 
of the over-eating so common nowadays. They have 
attributed neurasthenia to excessive eating and espe- 
cially to a too heavy meat diet. 
It is commonly admitted that intoxications of ex- 
ternal origin cause mental disorders; it has for a long 
time been possible also to show that intoxications of 
an internal origin play an essential part in particular 
psychoses. Following the direction formerly indicated 
by Bouchard in his argument against Charcot, many 
authors have shown a disposition to extend this notion 
and to consider most neuroses to be the consequence 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  82 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
of auto-intoxication in connection with gastro-intesti- 
nal disorders. 
Certain therapeutic results have their source in these 
notions. To regulate diet is often the first duty of 
psychotherapy and this should not be considered easy, 
for often it is necessary to make an appeal to all the 
forms of moral influence in order to bring it about 
that such patients consent to change their diet for a 
while and especially the quantity of their food. To 
impose a régime of dis-intoxication and sometimes to 
enforce fasting is a real psychotherapeutic treatment. 
In the neuroses there is no form of treatment for stom- 
ach and intestinal disorders that does not have occa- 
sion to be applied to patients whose chief symptoms 
were apparently psychological disorders. 
The circulatory functions have been examined from 
this same point of view and interesting results have 
followed. Changes of pulse rates in neuropaths are 
well known, acceleration being more frequent than 
retardation. Certain changes of pressure and especially 
changes in the vaso-motor functions are very fre- 
quently observed along with psychological troubles. 
Many of these patients regularly exhibit the reddening 
or paling of different regions of the skin and these 
regions exhibit notable changes in the peripheral tem- 
perature. Among some patients the appearance of 
such areas and even an odd tendency toward ecchy- 
moses announces a period of low morale. These con- 
gestions or local anemias which can affect different 
organs may cause disorders of various functions. 
The phenomenon of menstruation in women is con-
-P-A-G-E-91
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS 83 
nected both with the regulation of the peripheral cir- 
culation and with the functioning of the glands of 
internal secretion. It is important to note the dis- 
orders that menstruation regularly exhibits in the 
course of neuroses. We seldom find a woman seriously 
affected by a depressive neurosis who maintains nor- 
mal menstruation. 
All these disorders of circulation can be summed 
up by the description already used by M. Alquier: 
these patients exhibit a group of vaso-motor troubles 
along with cardio-vascular instability. Sometimes it 
is even possible to demonstrate these disorders by cer- 
tain tests: examination of the vaso-motor reaction 
from a pressure on the skin or on a nail, study of the 
diffuse reddening that follows a strong pressure at a 
point on the skin, the indications of dermographism, 
confirm the importance of this vaso-motor disequilib- 
rium. 
It is natural also that these observations should 
have given rise to a second group of physiological 
theories of neuroses. Dr. Savill in particular, in his 
book, “Clinical Lectures on Neurasthenia,” 1906, 
brought attention to the fact that serious modification 
of function may occur without a modification of the 
organ’s structure when there is an insufficient blood 
flow, and that this quantity is regulated by the vaso- 
motors. In attacks of nerves, he said, it is probable 
that a cerebral anemia accompanies a congestion of 
the splanchnic area. Most neuroses result from circu- 
latory disorders of this sort and may rightly be called 
vaso-motor neuroses or angio-neuroses.
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
Studies of the glands of internal secretion have 
shown that psychological disorders may be a part of 
the symptoms determined by the alteration of these 
glands. On the other hand, many neuropaths exhibit 
symptoms analogous to those that are observed in 
disorders of these secretions: symptoms of hypo- or 
hyperthyroidism often accompany depression or ob- 
sessions. The very interesting modifications of neu- 
roses in the course of pregnancy may be interpreted in 
like manner by changes in the ovarian and thyroid 
secretions. 
Since neuroses appear to be disorders in the evolu- 
tion of the individual, it is natural to connect them 
with the organic changes that occur expressly to regu- 
late the evolution of the organism. Leopold Levy and 
de Rothschild, who made a special study of the thy- 
roid body, consider neuro-arthritis to be a lack of 
thyroid equilibrium. The inheritance of an arthritic 
temperament would be a thyroid inheritance: “The 
thyroid body may be compared to a source of energy 
capable of setting the nervous system into motion, but 
not able to alter the nature of the motor.” Since the 
neurosis is not a defect in the motor itself but consists 
mainly in a decrease of tension in the motor activity, 
in a sort of hypo-functioning, these authors believe it 
should be considered primarily a deficiency in the thy- 
roid body. 
These last circulatory and glandular theories of neu- 
roses appear to me to be very important and it is not 
impossible that the physiological interpretation of neu- 
roses may gradually become oriented in this direction.
-P-A-G-E-93
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS 85 
And finally, the recent studies of the functioning of 
the sympathetic indicate new directions for investiga- 
tion: it is not hard to connect many neuropathic symp- 
toms with those that are sometimes observed among 
patients considered vagotonic, sometimes among the 
sympathico-tonic. 
It is true that these interpretations and the treat- 
ments derived from them are frequently the result of 
purely physiological studies. But when they are pro- 
posed with reference to psychological symptoms and 
with reference to the relationships that connect modi- 
fications of conduct with this or that visceral state, 
they have quite reached the borderline of psycho- 
therapy. 
2, REST TREATMENTS 
If the preceding forms of medicinal treatment are 
only on the borderline of psychotherapy and consti- 
tute only indirect treatment of psychological disorders, 
the rest treatment, which is likewise the result of physi- 
ological studies, is, on the contrary, among the most 
important curative methods of psychotherapy. 
A fundamental instinct leads animals and men to 
suppress certain disorders brought on by action, by 
performing another special act, namely, resting. Just 
as the tendency to eat, at the beginning of its activity, 
presents itself as hunger, so the tendency to rest, when 
it first appears, presents itself as fatigue, and this in 
turn vanishes as a result of complete rest. Some physi- 
ological and medical studies have shown that an ex- 
hausted organ is restored when its functioning is ar- 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  86 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
rested and there is a great benefit to be gained in treat- 
ing certain diseases by resting the heart or stomach as 
completely as possible. 
Now, many neuropathic disorders are like those re- 
sulting from fatigue; the observable symptoms in the 
two cases are quite analogous. The circumstances that 
cause neuroses to develop often consist of excessive 
work or effort either physical or intellectual. It is true 
that many neuropathic disorders seem to be deter- 
mined by emotion rather than by excessive work. But 
psychological analysis has demonstrated that in emo- 
tion there is likewise an excessive expenditure of force 
and that by many indications the phenomenon of emo- 
tion is only a variety of fatigue. Besides, many neu- 
ropaths betray their actual feelings by declaring them- 
selves worn out with fatigue, by saying that they were 
born tired and that their disease has never been any- 
thing but fatigue. Why not believe them and apply 
to them the natural treatment of fatigue, which is 
rest? 
Several American physicians in the middle of the 
last century tried to formulate the therapy that is the 
natural consequence of these remarks. Samuel J. 
Jackson began the organization of the treatment that 
was taken over and made more definite by Weir 
Mitchell and Playfair in 1875. This treatment was 
really quite simple; it consisted in putting the patients 
in the position ordinarily assumed when one wishes to 
rest: they had to remain stretched out and keep to 
their beds in the most perfect immobility. Weir 
Mitchell even forbade as far as possible the elementary
-P-A-G-E-95
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS 87 
movements demanded by the acts of daily life, meals, 
and the toilet. All their needs were cared for by nurses 
who looked after them with as few words as possible. 
They had to be fed like babies and given every atten- 
tion necessary for cleanliness. In order to avoid mus- 
cular atrophy which might be brought on by too great 
immobility, the patient had to submit to daily mas- 
sage. Along with physical repose Weir Mitchell pre- 
scribed for his patients a greatly increased diet. His 
system was not only a “rest cure” but a “mast cure.” 
The diet prescribed for these patients, numerous and 
plentiful meals, the quantity of milk that they ab- 
sorbed often astonishes us somewhat. In certain cases 
the patient’s weight was increased from sixty to eighty 
pounds in six weeks. And in order to better direct 
these treatments the patient was taken from his home 
and placed in an especially organized institution under 
the direct supervision of the physician. 
This treatment was rapidly made famous and popu- 
larized by various writers who were struck by its psy- 
chological character. In the midst of our active and 
restless life, they said, it is necessary to arrange for a 
period of complete mental and physical rest. They 
quickly concluded in America that the best means for 
curing neuroses was to retire into a sanatorium and 
call in Dr. Diet and Dr. Quiet. Sanatoriums were 
rapidly established everywhere to put Weir Mitchell’s 
- treatment into practice and it was the style to spend 
- several months now and then in rest and overfeeding 
in order to regain strength for the battle of life. 
These ideas penetrated more slowly into England 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
    88 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
and France; Charcot adopted them in part and helped 
to spread them abroad; and gradually establishments 
were built on the continent like those that were suc- 
ceeding so well in the United States. I do not think, 
however, that Weir Mitchell’s treatment has often 
been applied here in all its severity. 
A little later on analogous treatment was applied to 
mental disorders of the insane. In 1897 Magnan fin- 
ished the reform of “No restraint” and the suppression 
of isolation in cells by applying bed treatment to acute 
or sub-acute mental diseases. ‘Confinement to bed,” 
said M. Paul Sérieux in his study of Magnan’s work, 
“gives results that are unquestionable from the point 
of view of amelioration of the most distressing symp- 
toms; it dissipates physical and psychical complica- 
tions. . . . It has one particular result of prime impor- 
tance for Magnan, namely, the complete transforma- 
tion that this method gives to the appearance of insane 
asylums; the insane prison disappears to make way for 
a real hospital devoted to the treatment of mental 
diseases.” 
I believe it justified to couple with Weir Mitchell’s 
treatment a curious therapy that is little known, the 
one that makes use of prolonged hypnotic sleep. Long 
ago magnetists had observed that hypnotic sleep when 
somewhat prolonged has a calming and restoring effect. 
I myself formerly took some interest in these prolonged 
hypnoses: in 1889 I related how an hysterical para- 
plegia, already long established, which had resisted 
other treatments, disappeared after an hypnotic sleep 
continued over four days, and in 1896 with reference to 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS 89 
the treatment of hysteria, I published the result of 
some interesting experiments on this method. 
But Dr. Wetterstrand of Stockholm is the one who 
in 1892 derived a systematic treatment from these old 
records: he plunged his patients into an hypnotic 
state that enabled him to suggest rest and sleep to 
them, then he left them a long time, frequently more 
than three weeks in this state of sleep. The results of 
these treatments would often be very striking: attacks, 
contracture, delirium and, as he asserted, even major 
epileptic seizures would have definitely disappeared. 
In spite of these publications very few writers have 
been interested in this question and this type of 
treatment does not seem to have developed. 
It is enough to observe that the period was scarcely 
favorable to this study. The medical fashion had 
changed. Physicians were disgusted with hysteria, 
hypnotism and suggestion because they had been con- 
vinced that it was necessary to study a little psychol- 
ogy in order to understand them, and they would pre- 
fer to reject entirely all that concerned these prob- 
lems: treatments by prolonged sleep passed unnoticed. 
Among the more recent works, the most interesting 
that is directly related to Weir Mitchell’s teaching, is 
that of M. A. Deschamps, “Les maladies de l’énergie, 
thérapeutique générale.” This is a very curious work 
from a practical standpoint, which by its very exag- 
gerations enables us to understand better the rest treat- 
ment of neuroses. 
This author unhesitatingly applies to a whole group 
of invalids the interpretation that certain ones them-
-P-A-G-E-98
    90 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
selves offer us of their condition. These are the over- 
taxed, the chronically tired: the main clinical symptom 
is their proneness to fatigue, a disposition to succumb 
promptly to the harmful subjective and objective ef- 
fects of fatigue. Every patient who does not recover 
from his fatigue after a normal time and by the normal 
means of food and nocturnal repose, is called “fatig- 
able.” Among these patients exhaustion appears very 
quickly after the beginning of work and disappears 
very slowly, not after hours, but after weeks of repose. 
This fundamental symptom is not a simple psycho- 
logical fact, it is connected with a great many physio- 
logical troubles; all symptoms, whatever they may be, 
result from the primitive asthenia of the central nerv- 
ous system manifested by extreme fatigability. This 
exhaustion depends on a disorder in the production of 
nervous force which is not produced in sufficient quan- 
tity and particularly not at a sufficient degree of ten- 
sion. Cc 
The therapeutic conclusions from this theory may be 
summed up in a word, rest, always rest. “Nothing is 
worth so much as rest; it is the art of conserving one’s 
strength; it is the art of living.” The man who has 
risen and dressed cannot fix the limit of his movements, 
and circumstances force him to do more than he would 
wish; only the bed obliges him to keep quiet. He must 
take the same precautions for mental rest, for reading 
tires as much as walking. Later on, much later on, 
the patient may permit himself a few minutes’ walk. 
“Tf one can do a two-minute walk, two minutes a day 
will be done and this will not be increased until the
-P-A-G-E-99
  PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS 91 
capital force is improved. The asthenic possesses at a 
given moment a certain capital of forces. This capital 
is stable for the instant and always supplies the same 
sum of work income, beyond which lies bankruptcy. 
By degrees, as the asthenics improve, the time for pos- 
sible expenditure increases and the time for repose 
diminishes. But it will never go very far because the 
nervous system is never made over.” 
It seems to me that it is impossible to push any 
farther the interpretation of nervous diseases in terms 
of fatigue and their treatment by repose. M. Des- 
champ’s book seems to-day an excellent expression of 
the old conception of Weir Mitchell. 
Rest therapy is certainly one of the most important 
methods of treatment; it completes the group of prac- 
tices that one can up to the present, place under the 
heading of psychotherapy. These methods of treat- 
ment applied to various diseases have attempted to 
make use of the best known moral influences. Little 
by little they have passed beyond the religious and 
magic practices that sought to bring about miraculous 
cures. They have been transformed by the influence 
of the theories of animal magnetism, religious beliefs, 
and scientific knowledge. Now that we have seen their 
chief historical sources we must study the principles on 
which these various methods rest in order to be able 
to appreciate their true value.

MENTAL AGENCIES 
All these various forms of treatment have had their 
hour of fame. The temples of Asclepius and the 
miraculous springs drew immense crowds. At the 
death of Mrs. Eddy “Christian Science” had churches 
in all the cities in America and innumerable devotees. 
Hypnotism, originating in France, extended during 
somewhat more than twenty years over the whole 
world and psychoanalysis is now trying to follow its 
example. It is highly probable that these astonishing 
successes are caused by some real value in the various 
therapies. 
On the other hand, it is easy to demonstrate that 
these various psychotherapies all have a bizarre evolu- 
tion: they start up all at once, offer themselves with 
pride as the only effective and useful methods of treat- 
ment, they overrun the world like an epidemic, and 
then gradually, or all at once, they wane, and fall into 
ridicule and neglect. Such was the fate of magnetism, 
of hypnotism, of metallotherapy, and of many other 
forms of medication, and such, probably, will soon be 
the fate of psychoanalysis. We never see these ther- 
apies become fixed, developed, perfected, or leave 
methods and results that may be definitely taken over 
by traditional science. Official science never gives them 
a frank welcome; it tolerates them when it is neces- 
05

  96 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
sary during their period of expansion, but as inferiors, 
without recognizing them, and at the least oppor- 
tunity, when the epidemic is on the wane, official medi- 
cine hastens to crush and suppress them. But this does 
not keep them from reviving a few years afterwards in 
another form. 
How can we explain these singular evolutions, this 
periodic grandeur and decadence? There must be inti- 
mately mingled in these doctrines some elements of 
strength and some elements of weakness that have not 
yet been disentangled. To recognize these various 
elements and to appreciate the value of these various 
therapies it is necessary to inquire into the principles 
of these methods of treatment, the psychological laws 
on which they pretend to depend, in order to see if 
there is in them a real power that can be used. 
Taking up this standpoint, we shall divide these 
methods into two very different groups. Certain of 
these methods are not at all precise and rest on a very 
vague psychological notion, that of a mental action 
of some sort, the nature of which they do not attempt 
to determine; this is the characteristic that we find 
in the miraculous religious treatments in Mrs. Eddy’s 
“Christian Science,” in the practice of a therapy of 
morale like that of Dubois of Berne. The other psy- 
chotherapies, hypnotism for example, or Weir Mitch- 
ell’s rest, are much more precise, and try to make use 
of an accepted psychological phenomenon. As a begin- 
ning let us consider the first, the general psychother- 
apies, in order to appreciate the effectiveness of mental 
agencies,

1. THE INADEQUACY OF THE RECORDS 
We shall consider first the more primitive and sim- 
ple of these treatments, the miraculous treatments that 
still exist in our day. For the physician popular en- 
thusiasm is not a sufficient proof of the value of a treat- 
ment, and he desires to control the results obtained 
with more precision, but that is very difficult. The 
chief difficulty of the study of miracles does not lie 
in the interpretation; it lies in the verification of the 
facts. How can one know exactly what has. taken 
place? 
The knowledge we have of these facts comes to us 
solely through testimony, and we know how often the 
testimony of men is a source of defective information. 
“It is especially when the question is one of religious 
or political events,” said M. Le Bon, “that the defects 
of testimony are dangerous. During the centuries 
thousands of individuals have seen the devil, and if 
the unanimous testimony of so many observers could 
be considered to prove anything one might say that 
the devil is the personage whose existence is the best 
demonstrated. . . . In the matter of testimony it is 
the good faith of individuals that is dangerous, and 
not their bad faith.” 
People have often said to me, “Why do you yourself 
not undertake this criticism; why not verify yourself 
the miraculous things observed at Lourdes, whose 
reading seems to have interested you?” They do not 
consider the time and work that it would be necessary 
to expend to avoid fraud, to calm wounded feelings,
-P-A-G-E-106
  98 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
to check up the witnesses one by one, or what hate 
and bitterness it would be necessary to stir up in order 
to get a true idea of the motives that have influenced 
the pretended testimonials. It would be an enormous 
task for a very small result. We can understand why 
many conscientious observers are disgusted at such a 
task and are contented with the conclusion of Dubois: 
“In these pilgrimages, there is a special mental state 
of the testimonial office. Lourdes is not far from Taras- 
con... . One returns with a painful feeling, weary 
of superstition.” 
In connection with “Christian Science” the mate- 
rials for study are not lacking. We are really sub- 
merged by a deluge of records of marvellous cures. 
Here we have enough to satisfy the most obstinate. 
Why are we not convinced? It is because these records 
are edited in a disturbing way and do not contain any- 
thing that might reassure us as to their exactness. 
They always concern poor unfortunates who, for years 
suffer in every part of their bodies, who have lost all 
feeling, whose internal organs are all displaced, and 
who are remarkably cured, because everything returns 
to its place. “For discussing such cases,” an English 
author aptly remarks, “It is enough to recall the story 
of Mary Jolly that one reads on the fourth page of the 
Journals: this poor girl, after having suffered martyr- 
dom for thirty years as the result of the decomposition 
of her curdled blood, was suddenly cured when she ate 
a fine Arabian soup 4 la Révalesciére.” These records 
concern the popular diagnosis that the sufferer him- 
self makes according to his own sensations and dictates
-P-A-G-E-107

to his healer. The latter tends the more to admit this 
diagnosis, the more terrible is the disease in question, 
the more honor its cure will do him, and the more the 
reader fails to understand the meaning of the words 
used, 
Add, as many authors have demonstrated, that such 
records are full of contradictions, that the physicians 
and the patients themselves have often protested 
against the publication of false cures, that there have 
been published cases in which the sufferers declare that’ 
they have been treated for nine years without any 
relief in spite of their ardent faith, and we shall under- 
stand that it is hard to form a reasoned opinion on 
“Christian Science” from the numberless records it has 
published. 
Does the method of treating the sick by moral direc- 
tion offer much good result? This is the only impor- 
tant question for the physician. This question seems 
at first easy enough to decide. The facts are open to 
the light of day. The medical diagnoses are no longer 
so rudimentary as in “Christian Science.” Several 
authors even publish statistics that seem very instruc- 
tive. 
Unhappily this is not entirely correct, and at pres- 
ent it does not seem to me possible either to put in 
order the statistics, or to attribute the least importance 
to the statistics that have been published. Neither the 
total number of subjects that have been treated, nor 
the number of cures obtained, have any real signifi- 
cance. The total number of subjects would have an 
interest only if there were included in that number
-P-A-G-E-108
    100 wrgy PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY | 
all thes sufferers who present themselves, sovidad that 
they really belong to a scientifically determined nos- 
ological group, and that they are not arbitrarily 
chosen. But we are here concerned with subjects, 
affected with psychoneuroses, that is to say, with dis- 
eases whose precise definition has not been given. 
The authors in this field consider their patients neu- 
ropaths because psychological events play a consider- 
able part in their disease. This answer is not at all 
definite: since man is a thinking being, psychological 
phenomena are involved in almost all disease, even if 
such phenomena are only in the form of pain, anxiety, 
or despair. I have already tried to show that the defi- 
nition cf the neuroses in terms of the intervention of 
psychological phenomena was quite worthless.1 
In reality, the moralizers make very little use of 
the foregoing definition, and they usually classify their 
patients by two characteristics that are purely nega- 
tive. For them, the neuropaths, (1) have no lesions, 
and, (2) are not insane. Besides the usual incon- 
venience of purely negative definitions, these rest on 
two notions that are vague and even unintelligible. 
As I have already several times explained, I fail to 
understand what is meant when diseases without 
lesions are talked of. And for the rest, that radical 
division of the neuropathic from the insane, which very 
often exists even in the thinking of physicians, is not 
scientifically admissible. 
We might be at first astonished to see the benefits 
of psychotherapy refused those who need them most, 
* Les névroses, 1909, p. 378.
-P-A-G-E-109
MENTAL AGENCIES 101 
those for whom a method of treatment determined by 
psychological considerations is most suited. But to my 
notion, there is a more important consideration that 
rules the whole debate, it is the right interpretation 
of the word “insane.” This word “insane” is not a 
term from medical language, nor is it from scientific 
language; it is a term of popular language, or, better, 
of the language of the police. An insane person is an 
individual who is dangerous to others, or to himself, 
without being legally responsible for the danger that 
he creates. This definition does not apply to the in- 
trinsic characters of the disease, but to an extrinsic 
and accidental characteristic that depends on the situ- 
ation in which the sufferer finds himself. It is impos- 
sible to say that such or such a disorder defined by the 
physician will always leave the sufferer harmless, and 
that some other will always make him legally danger- 
ous. The danger created by a subject depends much 
more on the social circumstances in which he is placed 
than on the nature of his psychological disorder. Such 
a distinction between the insane and the sane, though 
necessary for maintaining the peace of cities, does not 
really change either the diagnosis or the prognosis. 
The conception of psychoneuroses based uniquely on 
these two characteristics remains thus a vague one, 
and the sufferers to whom are applied the moralizing 
treatments are thus chosen somewhat arbitrarily. 
Alas, at the risk of passing as a good deal of a sceptic, 
I must say that to my notion, it is necessary to be on 
guard against the cures themselves. Many of these 
patients declare themselves cured in order that they 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
    102 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
may no longer have to pay the hospital fee, which is 
expensive, or in order to regain their liberty and be no 
longer bored behind their bed-curtains, in order to get 
rid of the physician or to please him, or quite simply 
because they wish so much to be cured that they end 
by believing they are. ‘That makes little difference,” 
M. Dubois would say, “for a neuropath who believes 
himself cured is a neuropath cured, since the neurosis 
is only the idea of the disease.” These are words that 
such authors like to repeat; in reality there are neuro- 
paths who believe themselves cured and who are not 
cured. Let us add that the certification of the cure 
of such subjects can never be made quickly, and that 
it is necessary to wait for a rather long time, varying 
according to the case, to be protected from the fre- 
quent fluctuations in these subjects, and to avoid being 
exposed to a relapse that is really nothing but the 
evolution of the disease. Be also on guard against 
subjects who actually recover, but who recover quite 
independently of your moralizing treatment, simply 
because they would recover of their own accord, in a 
given time. The psychosis called manic-depressive in- 
sanity is to-day much over-emphasized and applied 
wrongly or capriciously; but it is none the less true 
that certain depressions caused by a fatigue or an 
emotion seem to need to continue for a definite time 
and that recovery is inevitable at the end of that time. 
Happy the physician who has been consulted shortly 
before the end of the attack! But one should not be 
too sure of these cases in the statistics favorable to a 
treatment. In a word, the cures are hard to certify,
-P-A-G-E-111
  MENTAL AGENCIES 103 
because they are no better defined than the disease 
itself. Each author interprets them in his own way 
and counts them more or less numerous according as 
he is himself more or less modest. In these conditions, 
can we draw any very precise information from all 
these statistics? 
~ We have taken “Christian Science” and medical mor- 
alization as examples, but in the other therapies of the 
same sort we should have met like difficulties. There 
is, unfortunately, a condition of enthusiasm in these 
too general and too vague psychotherapies, a tendency 
to proselyting, and, it must be said, to advertising, 
that alters the critical sense of the observers. It seems 
likely that this is one of the chief reasons that has 
provoked hostility toward medical treatments pre- 
sented in this fashion. 
2. THE REAL EFFICACY OF GENERAL PSYCHOTHERAPIES 
This bad impression must not be exaggerated, and 
it would be a great mistake to deny completely the 
power of these general moral therapies. 
The collections of records relating to miracles are 
not scientific works and should not be criticized in the 
same fashion. It is very hard to estimate the value 
of each fact in particular, and, nevertheless, there 
attaches to the whole a certain impression of truth. 
There are cases in which the calculus of probabilities 
can offer as a quasi-certitude for a group of facts, al- 
though each of the facts considered in isolation might 
tell us nothing. I believe in a general way that there 
are cures at Lourdes; I believe still more that there
-P-A-G-E-112
104 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
were many cures at the time when animal magnetism 
was at its height. There are reasons enough for our 
having this total impression: the most important is 
the very success of these pilgrimages and these magic 
practices. There is no smoke without fire, and nations 
would not have preserved through centuries the re- 
ligious and magic methods of treatment if these treat- 
ments had not exerted some influence. Scientific medi- 
cine, or nearly scientific medicine, has perfected and 
made somewhat more certain the methods of religious 
or magic medicine; but it has done nothing but con- 
tinue them; and it would never have had its begin- 
ning if these had not been already imposed on human- 
ity by their effective usefulness. Let us add to this 
general remark that each of us has, moreover, admitted 
some of these cures called miraculous. Even at Sal- 
pétriére there may have been seen patients cured by the 
placing of the holy sacrament on their heads. We have 
ourselves cured many sufferers by processes like those 
of magnetism. The cures reported by the miracle- 
makers follow the same laws as the cures effected in 
our presence, which renders them very plausible. Char- 
cot had insisted on that point in studying the cures 
effected on the tomb of Deacon Paris. I have demon- 
strated the same facts in connection with records col- 
lected in the register of cures of the Precious Blood 
of Fécamp. Recently M. Mangin made the same kind 
of study of the cures of Lourdes. 
If we consider the treatments effected by “Christian 
Science,” a completely negative conclusion would be, 
I believe, as little reasonable as an enthusiastic admira- 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
| 
MENTAL AGENCIES 105 
tion. Many records are not so ridiculous as the fore- 
going and present a certain plausibility; we have no 
right to reject them entirely. Moreover, we have our- 
selves known persons who seemed to have found a 
real relief in various neuropathic disorders from the 
practices of “Christian Science”; drunkards have ac- 
tually stopped drinking; morphine addicts have given 
up morphine without having need of an isolation cure; 
attacks of depression seem to have been arrested in 
their evolution. We are disposed to believe that these 
cures could have been obtained otherwise; this is pos- 
sible. But that does not keep us from agreeing that 
they have been produced in this fashion. There is, 
above all, one remarkable effect that must be reckoned 
with in the action of these idealistic conversations, 
namely, their influence on the chimerical fears, on the 
exaggerated precautions that so many people take for 
preserving their health in minor ailments. “To be 
freed from the dread of fevers, from the dread of colds 
in the head,” Mark Twain tells us, “to be freed from 
the dread of having eaten horrible things and of having 
incurred an indigestion, from the terror of having the 
feet wet and of getting into a sweat; to be always 
contented and happy—isn’t that something? Who 
would not pay for that?” Finally, as we have already 
had occasion to remark concerning miracles, such a 
success, much more considerable than that at Lourdes, 
would not be intelligible if there were not some bene- 
ficient influence in the therapeutic methods of the old 
healer, P. P. Quimby, and in spite of all the very neces- 
sary criticism I am convinced that “Christian Science”  
-P-A-G-E-114
  
  106 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
in exploiting these methods has furnished useful 
notions by which moral therapy should profit. 
In the works that treat of the medical use of morale, 
we find very often excellent medical and psychological 
observations. The larger part of medicine and espe- 
cially psychiatry is still in a period of individual ob- 
servations: a good description of a well-known patho- 
logical type is worth more than many theories and 
arbitrary classifications, and the foregoing authors, in 
Europe as well as in America, have analyzed very well 
a great number of neuropathic disorders and have 
demonstrated with precision their transformation un- 
der the influence of these moral treatments. The 
criticisms, which are much exaggerated on this point, 
hold that in these cures there are involved only insig- 
nificant diseases, “minor hysterical anorexias, neuras- 
thenias from overwork, mild phobias.” I am not of 
this opinion. We never know the degree of severity 
that a neurosis may take, once begun, and these con- 
scientious observations show us very plain symptoms 
that we can recognize because we have seen them in 
our most serious cases. If such a neurosis has not 
shown itself very severe in its development, it is quite 
likely that this is because of the treatment through 
morale. From this point of view we may reéxamine 
several observations in the work of M. Dubois that 
refer to depressed patients with astasia-abasia, con- 
tractures, or with pains and various phobias, obses- 
sions, and hypochondrias, who seem really to have 
been gradually transformed. The record of M. Y. 
impresses me all the more since I am quite familiar
-P-A-G-E-115
MENTAL AGENCIES 107 
with that type of patient constantly obsessed with the 
idea of fatigue and suffering agony at the thought of 
the slightest movement. I do not interpret these 
patients at all in the same way as M. Dubois, but I 
have attempted like him to make them move and I 
know how difficult that is. Furthermore, I consider 
the results he obtained remarkable. 
These reflections on the more typical of the methods 
of general psychotherapy show us that it would be 
quite unjust and even absurd to deny categorically the 
effectiveness of these methods of cure. 
3. INACCURATE INTERPRETATIONS 
These general conclusions, moreover, are not seri- 
ously questioned, and no one denies that psychological 
influences have brought excellent results with patients 
in special circumstances. But medical men restrict 
themselves to accepting the fact without according it 
any importance, without granting that it is necessary 
to try to reproduce it and make use of it. There is 
no doubt that most physicians practice psychotherapy, 
but they practice it without knowing it, or if they 
are half-aware of it, they prefer to lie to themselves 
and persuade themselves that they use methods that 
are wholly physiological. 
The reason for this ostracism is perhaps the uncer- 
tain and random character of these therapies. I have 
proposed to admit that the miraculous springs some- 
times effect cures. One will grant me, I think, without 
more argument, that they more often miscarry. The 
sufferers who have been on pilgrimages, who have im-
-P-A-G-E-116
108 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
plored the gods with the prescribed ceremonies or who 
have been magnetized indefinitely without feeling any 
relief, are numbered by millions. The proportion of 
cures to failures is extremely small. Furthermore, we 
have no way of knowing in advance whether one indi- 
vidual has more chance than another to be cured by a 
miracle. The same is true for the treatments by 
“Christian Science.” For the treatments by moraliza- 
tion, physicians seem to have the impression that psy- 
chological treatments succeed by chance and that they 
involve a sort of lottery. 
This explanation does not seem to me to be suffi- 
cient. Many medical treatments or surgical oper- 
ations present, especially in their beginning, the same 
random character. We know very well that this char- 
acteristic diminishes, without disappearing entirely, 
to the extent that the operation is performed with 
more precision, and the indications for treatment have 
been better determined. This is the essential charac- 
teristic; the psychotherapies seem never able to offer 
such precision, or to give such indications. Their 
authors do not succeed in showing exactly the laws 
on which they rely, what they wish to bring about, 
or what they fear. In a word, the interpretations they 
offer for their therapeutic successes are always very 
vague and often evidently false. 
The first interpretations of miraculous or magic cures 
are no more able to satisfy us. Can we seriously think 
that these sufferers were cured because they slept 
beside the statue of Apollo or because the magnetist 
sent them a fluid leaving his fingers in the form of
-P-A-G-E-117
MENTAL AGENCIES 109 
blue flames? Is denying evil and repeating that the 
body does not exist, that “the mind is stronger than a 
fish, placed in water or in the stomach,” enough to 
cure dyspeptics? Is there any scientific proof of the 
action of magnets and metals on a living body? On 
the contrary, has it not been shown that magnetizing 
by an electric current brings about no reaction if it 
is done without the subject’s knowledge? Can one 
take seriously the symbolical constructions, often gro- 
tesque, that give all dreams an obscene interpretation 
and that explain all diseases by sexual metaphors? 
To appreciate the insufficiency of the theories pre- 
sented by the psychotherapists, we may take as an 
example one of the simplest of the therapies, the one 
that seems to have been most favorably received by 
physicians, the medical use of morale offered by Dubois 
of Berne and supported by Déjérine. Doubtless its 
high moral worth commands respect, but it cannot be 
said that its explanations satisfy the intelligence. They 
propose to cure the sick by instruction and moral lec- 
tures. They hold that it is enough to acquaint pa- 
tients with the medical truth concerning their disease, 
and the philosophical truth concerning the world, that 
it is necessary to improve their character, and supply 
them with fine, energetic and generous conduct. They 
will be cured into the bargain. 
From the moral point of view this is perfect, but 
from the medical point of view is it very intelligible? 
Is it very certain that it is necessary to know the truth 
about the mechanism of a disease in order to recover 
from it? How many men have recovered from measles 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
    110 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
or from typhoid fever with no comprehension what- 
ever? It is not the same, the moralists will reply, with 
mental disorders where the idea one has of the disease 
has an influence on the disease itself. There is no 
proof whatever for this; the most competent psy- 
chiatrist can succumb to a severe depression and be a 
victim of fixed ideas; he will rid himself of it no better 
than another, even if he knows its mechanism. Many 
sufferers from melancholia recover by themselves after 
three months, with no understanding of their mental 
disorder. But, indeed, is it certain that the sick are 
reassured when they know that their disorders are 
purely mental and that they have no organic lesion? 
Is it certain that they will be benefited by this knowl- 
edge? It is not at all certain that such reasoning alone 
is in itself enough to reassure them. Many invalids 
are terrified at the notion that they have mental dis- 
orders; they would prefer to have physical disorders, 
and then it is going to be very difficult to make such 
a demonstration. 
You would cure the sick by teaching them the truth 
about their disease; but what is the truth? Do you 
know it yourself? Dubois tells them that they have 
no organic lesion; is this exact? There are, perhaps, 
lesions that you do not yet recognize: a functional 
disease accompanies lesions that are at least transitory. 
He maintains that all the exhaustion of psychasthenics 
depends simply on “the idea of fatigue” and that there 
is no real exhaustion in addition. I may be allowed 
to observe that I am not at all convinced. M. Dubois 
shows a paralyzed girl that her paralysis depends solely
-P-A-G-E-119
  MENTAL AGENCIES 111 
on an idea she has in her head. I am well aware that 
it is the fashion to-day to say that the hysteric is ill 
because she has taken it into her head to be ill, or 
because the physician has put the notion into her 
head. That is obviously very simple, but is it quite 
the truth? There are still some who doubt it. We 
might go on indefinitely: There is not one of M. Du- 
bois’ psychological explanations that is not question- 
able and that a patient with a little knowledge might 
not contradict. 
Moreover, he is not contented with this pretended 
medical truth, he hastens to explain more important 
truths to the patient. He expounds to him a veritable 
system of general philosophy, and chooses for this 
teaching a form of rational philosophy that is to-day 
summarized in the manuals for the candidate for the 
bachelor’s degree. Why should this philosophy, al- 
ready somewhat obsolete, be enough to give calm and 
happiness to all minds? In other days Lucretius in his 
superb poems presented the materialism of Epicurus 
as the supreme consolation for sick minds and restless 
souls. All philosophies have in their turn pretended 
to play that réle. Why should this one be chosen as 
a panacea? Why disturb the religious convictions of 
one person or the tranquil materialism of another? 
Are you quite sure that your classic manual will bring 
them more faith and more hope? 
Let us go farther. Convictions are nothing without 
acts. It is the patient’s conduct that must be reformed 
in its entirety. He must be taught to live a life worth 
living; and to attain this he must be taught a sort of
-P-A-G-E-120
  112 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
stoicism tempered with Christian charity. Such an 
ethics is to alter his will as a whole. Such a profound 
change of morals will indirectly suppress all the symp- 
toms, for it is obvious that a will that has reached 
such a high degree of superiority will no longer tolerate 
such defects. 
From the theoretic point of view that seems to me 
superb; from the practical point of view, it leaves me 
uneasy. Doubtless it is always useful and right to 
change a lazy coward into a brave worker, or an egoist 
into a generous man, and such a transformation should 
have the happiest effects on the pathological symp- 
toms. But this is a very extensive undertaking and 
one that seems to me not always possible and that is, 
fortunately, not always necessary. Is this what the 
patient demands of us when he comes to ask us to 
rid him of a tic, of insomnia, or of a stomach pain? 
Is this the réle for simple physicians like us? Have 
we time and means for it? It would be easy to show 
that the alliance between physician and preacher such 
as appears to have been realized at Boston in the 
“Emmanuel Movement” is not very reasonable, and 
that it is, in spite of appearances, as irksome for the 
preacher as for the doctor.” 
All these doctrines seem to go back to a very old 
belief that in other days made disease a sin and an 
error. In ancient civilizations sickness was a moral 
evil because it rendered the sick person useless to 
society and dangerous by contagion. He was killed or 
expelled from the tribe. Men have long preserved 
? Les médications psychologiques, I, p. 120.
-P-A-G-E-121
  
MENTAL AGENCIES 113 
that old idea and we still have difficulty in keeping 
from a feeling of repulsion toward the disgraceful dis- 
eases. Later on, customs were relaxed. The sick man 
is no longer a brutal criminal, but he is still held some- 
thing of a criminal, as one is when he errs by inatten- 
tion or ignorance. Sickness has become an error. That 
idea rules in “Christian Science” and the Scientists’ 
journals seriously wrote that Mrs. Eddy “was ten days 
in error” when she died of the pneumonia of advanced 
years. Dubois seems to have stopped at the same 
point, for he constantly speaks of error and he really 
treats his patients as if they were simply in sin and 
in error. Medical science of to-day obviously cannot 
take the same point of view, and the result is a con- 
stant feeling of misunderstanding when we read the 
admonitions of these moralistic physicians. 
For us to credit various psychotherapies with re- 
markable cures and, in spite of this to find their inter- 
pretations so vague and unreasonable, may cause aston- 
ishment. This does not appear to me a contradic- 
tion; when they explain their therapeutic system the 
authors try to interpret facts of observation that con- 
sist in their own treatments and the obvious results. 
The facts observed are exact, but the theory that they 
offer for them is inexact or at least very incomplete. 
They have, in fact, succeeded in curing certain pa- 
tients, but they do not take into account what they 
have done and they attribute their success to a detail 
that may have played an insignificant part.. This bad 
interpretation casts an unfavorable shadow on the 
treatment itself.
-P-A-G-E-122
  114 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
It is easy to understand this importance of the sci- 
entific interpretation of cures, however real. The sim- 
ple recording of a phenomenon does not make possible 
its use. Scientific applications, prediction, and repro- 
duction do not depend on observation, but on the 
knowledge of the law, that is to say, on the interpre- 
tation. One may have some practical successes with 
methods that are poorly understood, but he cannot by 
any means predict such successes or reproduce them. 
One cannot make progress in passing from one case 
to another or in profiting from experience. One tends 
to be content with counting on some happy outcomes, 
and, if the outcomes are too bad, to console himself 
by saying, like Dubois, that it is the fault of the 
patients, who are decidedly too insane. 
If we cannot make progress ourselves without cor- 
rect interpretation, there is all the more reason why 
we cannot teach it to others. Since your own success 
depends on a host of things of which you are ignorant, 
and perhaps on a host of things that are your per- 
sonal qualities, on your height, on your beard, or your 
tone of voice, you do not know what directions to give 
pupils in order that they may succeed in the same way. 
You explain to them your theories, that is to say, the 
most insignificant and the most false part of your work. 
If they then try to apply what you have taught them, 
exaggerating it, of course, and leaving out the essen- 
tial that you have not told them, they will be simply 
ridiculous and they will discredit your methods. This 
is the essential difficulty of the psychotherapies. Su- 
perficial and inexact interpretations have stopped the 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  MENTAL AGENCIES 115 
evolution of processes of treatment that in themselves 
possessed usefulness and power. 
4, THE POWER OF THE MIND 
This failure at explanation is due to something that 
was scarcely suspected at first, namely the complexity 
of the facts and laws that enter into these treatments 
and cures. It is easy to obtain some notion of this 
by glancing over the evolution of ideas that produced 
psychotherapy. 
The point of departure was the observation of mirac- 
ulous or magic cures. Gradually it began to be sus- 
pected that these facts, in spite of their accidental 
appearance, were not beyond the bounds of determin- 
ism. Charcot, in his remarkable study on “la foi qui 
guérit” ® clearly showed that these miraculous cures 
always occurred under very similar conditions. It is 
easy to discover in different countries and in different 
historical periods the same external circumstances, the 
same personnel, the same practices imposed on the 
sick. I have had occasion to show that the same facts 
can be found connected with animal magnetism. This 
community of practice, said Charcot, persisting 
through so many centuries and among so many differ- 
ent peoples, is obviously very significant. It proves 
that the miracle is not so arbitrary nor so free as might 
be thought and that, miracle though it may be, it is 
subject to laws that have remained unchanged. In 
reality the miracle is no more arbitrary than the thun-

der or the lightning that the ancients also attributed 
to the gods. “We must penetrate the determinism of 
these new facts, of these natural phenomena that have 
occurred everywhere; we must make a science of the 
miracle in order to reproduce it at will.” 
That is all very well, but this science is hard to 
formulate and it takes shape slowly. At an early period 
there had been noticed the part that the thoughts 
and feelings of the sick play in this determinism and it 
had been suspected that there was involved a special 
force dependent on the human mind. Galen had al- 
ready said “the Temples of Asclepius furnish us with 
the proof that many serious diseases can be cured 
by nothing more than a shock given to the mind.” 
The practices that have been recognized as contrib- 
uting to the realization of a miracle, the long pilgrim- 
ages, the prolonged waits, the marvellous stories, the 
religious exaltation, the public meetings, the emotion 
caused by the marvellous and the terrible, etc., are 
assured causes for great psychic disturbances. More 
recently, indeed, studies of a somewhat special psy- 
chological fact, the phenomenon of suggestion, have 
come to show that in certain cases, by means of defi- 
nitely psychological procedure, there could be brought 
about certain events quite comparable to those seen 
in miraculous cures. From all these observations it 
was concluded that it was in the realm of psychology 
that there must be sought the determinism for mir- 
acles and the means for more regularly producing the 
same effects. 
These observations led to the first progress: in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  MENTAL AGENCIES 117 
beginning, the operator, priest, or magician did not, 
any more than his patients, suspect the nature of the 
forces he was trying to bring into play. Later on, 
the operator, at least, comprehended that he was mak- 
ing use of mental forces and behaved accordingly: one 
already notices this evolution in the interpretation of 
certain magnetists. A notion of the power of thought 
forms the basis of the inspiration of P. P. Quimby, 
Mrs. Eddy’s teacher; it dominates the practices of 
Christian Science and many psychotherapies of the 
same type. 
With medical use of morale we make another step 
in advance. Not only the operator but the patient 
himself is aware that it is solely a matter of thought; 
thought is being acted upon, an attempt is being made 
to alter it, and thought is counted on “to cure the body 
through the mind.” Gradually the notion of the réle 
of thought in disease and in health has become more 
definite and more precise. The famous book of Hack 
Tuke on “Body and Mind” states very well the opinion 
that was generally coming to be held. The author is 
satisfied when he has demonstrated the action of a 
mental phenomenon, whatever it may be, and he does 
not try to make it any more definite. He limits him- 
self to admitting in a general way the action of the 
mind and recognizes it as powerful. Once this force 
is recognized, he wishes to put it to immediate use 
in the form in which he conceives it, as a simple force 
that can be maneuvered as an integral whole. 
The various psychotherapies seem, indeed, to be 
somewhat more specific and appear to have recourse
-P-A-G-E-126
118 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
to different psychological phenomena. Some speak of 
faith, of belief, of truth: they have imagined that 
powerful thought was true thought, philosophical and 
metaphysical thought, and they heal by means of 
idealism. Others talk of logical and rational thought, 
of good thought, and they cure by means of reasoning 
and morale. The former maintain that it is a question 
of the power of imagination, the latter, of the force 
of expectant attention. But these various terms do 
not correspond to different psychic phenomena: the 
authors choose them at random according to their 
training, according to the vague psychological notions 
they have heard talked about. In reality psychother- 
apists employ these different words in order to distin- 
guish between themselves, much more than between 
the facts: they wish to show that they have found a 
new method of treatment in order to entice away the 
patients of a predecessor. But they all do about the 
same thing and try to exploit the force of the mind 
in its entirety simply because it is a psychic force. 
There is a grave error here: the psychic phenomena 
that are involved are in reality extremely complex 
and different from each other. It is enough to consider 
the influences that are at work in miraculous cures to 
understand this. Studies on suggestion have shown 
that in certain cases, facts like the foregoing could be 
reproduced by this method, and for a short time every- 
thing was to be explained by this particular phenom- 
enon. Partisans of religious interpretation have pro- 
tested, and have tried to prove that not all miraculous 
cures could be explained by suggestion. The discus-
-P-A-G-E-127
  MENTAL AGENCIES 119 
sion has often been harmed by their complete ignor- 
ance of the nature of suggestion. But this is of minor 
importance; I should willingly grant that they are 
partly right and that not all psychic phenomena that 
occur here are suggestions. Religious faith, faith in 
science, even when it is a question of pseudo-religion 
and pseudo-science with all that they contain of un- 
bridled hopes and powerful tendencies, must evidently 
play a great part. Instinctive respect for wealth, for 
power, has made it possible for kings as well as priests 
to cure the sick. Travel, fatigue, strangeness of envir- 
onment, a change of physical and mental hygiene, emo- 
tional shocks of all kinds, the influence of public opin- 
ion shown by the reputation of a remedy, and the 
powerful and so little known action of crowds, all this 
has acted on the minds of the sick. Zola puts this very 
well in his picture of Lourdes: “Auto suggestion, 
excitement set up long in advance, the undertaking 
of the journey, prayers, hymns, increasing exaltation, 
and above all the healing influence, the unknown 
force that emanates from crowds in an acute crisis of 
faith.” 
Among all these influences I should like to note in 
particular one that seems to me important, although 
little known, and one that we shall meet again, namely, 
the nervous and mental stimulation induced in an 
individual by the part he has to play. We are only 
beginning to comprehend that many physical diseases 
as well as mental are determined by the depression of 
nervous force and that this depression is fostered by 
every unhappiness, by every form of inaction. How
-P-A-G-E-128
120 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
many people are ill because they have nothing interest- 
ing to do, because their lives are vulgar, dismal and 
monotonous, because they have no hope, no ambition, 
no aim in life, because no one is interested in them, 
because they can see no way ever to become interesting 
to anyone. Take a person of this type, make him 
understand that he is to be the object of a miracle by 
the Holy Virgin, that the all powerful Divinity has 
singled him out from thousands of other men in order 
to bestow on him particular and visible grace, that he 
is going to carry in himself the living proof of the 
reality of religion and serve in the eternal salvation 
of an impious century. Take a simple little woman 
who is bored, without interest or aim in life, and make 
her understand that she is to become a clairvoyant 
somnambulist, able by thought to traverse time and 
space, to astonish mankind and heap benefits upon it; 
make her understand that she is to collaborate with a 
superior man, to whom she will give her time, her 
life, a little of her love in order that he may write, 
thanks to her, a book that shall save humanity. Is 
it not evident that such individuals are going to be 
mentally and physically transformed, without its being 
necessary to appeal to the power of the Gods or to the 
action of a fluid. These are some of the psychic influ- 
ences that are involved in miracles and it is most 
probable that there are many more of them that we 
do not know how to analyze. 
The same comment can be made with reference to 
other psychotherapeutic methods; among the good 
effects of medical moralization, logical reasoning of
-P-A-G-E-129
  MENTAL AGENCIES 121 
which Dubois of Berne speaks, should play, as we 
have seen, a very small part. A great number of other 
psychological factors have a decided effect. There is, 
first of all, the journey, the change of place, and in 
other cases the singular proceeding that consists in 
going to seek for a medical consultation in a temple. 
In many of these treatments there is isolation, rest in 
bed, discipline. Let us add other mental influences, 
threats, for instance, and even punishment, because 
patients are shut up; they are given to understand 
that their isolation will be long or short, according to 
their conduct; in certain cases they are left to be bored 
behind the curtains of a bed and they are refused even 
a book to read or any work to do if they do not improve 
or appear to be improved. I am not criticizing this 
procedure; I am only calling attention to the fact that 
it is not pure reason and that there is here another 
influence than that of logic. We notice still other 
purely educative methods, such as the monotonous 
repetition of the same thing at the same time of day, 
exercises of attention in listening every day to a little 
lesson in philosophy, various forms of stimulation 
because the patient is made to understand that he is 
considered intelligent, capable of being guided by rea- 
son alone. One should even, as Dubois wisely recom- 
mends, try to praise the patient’s good qualities in 
order to raise him in his own esteem. There is also 
the example of the physician, who appears firm and 
decided. Those doubting patients who have never 
believed in anything ought certainly to be impressed 
by seeing a man so thoroughly convinced of Leibniz’s
-P-A-G-E-130
  122 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
philosophy. There is even some suggestion in these 
treatments, in spite of the horror that Dubois feels 
for this method. It is very difficult to avoid entirely 
the development of some automatic phenomena that 
occur in the patient’s mind in response to our appear- 
ance or speech. This therapy is not at all, then, as its 
theorists imagine it, purely rational; it appeals to the 
reason and the feelings and to the passions and to the 
automatism of habit and to anything you choose. 
It endeavors to make use of all psychological facts 
indiscriminately simply because they are psychological 
and because in a general way the power of thought 
has been recognized. 
In connection with these general psychotherapies 
may be recalled the memory of an old medicament 
that played a great rdle in the Middle Ages, theriac. 
It was a general cure-all that could be used in every 
possible case because there had been put into it by 
the hundred all the active agents that were known. 
The patient was made to swallow it all in the hope 
that the disease, whatever it might be, could find in 
this mixture what it demanded. The therapeutic 
methods that I have just described seem to me iden- 
tical with a sort of psychological theriac, that calls 
forth indiscriminately all the psychic phenomena, that 
appeals to all the mental operations in every patient 
whoever he may be, in the hope that each of them 
will be able to find what he needs in this mixture. 
This happens occasionally and psychological theriacs 
have certainly had some successes. But one should 
not be surprised if they do not always succeed, or, that
-P-A-G-E-131
  MENTAL AGENCIES 123 
such treatments are considered as lotteries by official 
science. 
This characteristic of a certain number of psycho- 
therapies is not peculiar to them, it has occurred in 
exactly the same way at a certain stage in the evolu- 
tion of every science. Physicists wanted to make use 
of electricity before they had made out its laws and 
phenomena. From time to time they obtained some 
results, but they could not predict anything, and they 
could not teach practical methods. Physics had to 
analyze electrical phenomena and not describe elec- 
tricity in general under different names. Psychother- 
apy will not be able to develop unless psychologists 
discover in the foregoing methods or in others more 
recent, some notions of the forces of the mind that will 
be more precise and more fruitful.
-P-A-G-E-132
    CHAPTER II 
THE UTILIZATION OF AUTOMATISM 
The great shortcoming of the use of morale is that 
it is a theriac that tries to employ haphazard all the 
psychological influences in connection with any trou- 
ble whatsoever, provided that it be vaguely neuro- 
pathic: it is this that makes so difficult the establish- 
ment of actual cures, the verification of experiments 
and the teaching of the doctrine. We should try to 
find out whether other psychotherapies have all shown 
the same characteristic and particularly whether stud- 
ies in suggestion have not made known to us a more 
exact psychological principle that would permit of 
somewhat better determined therapeutic application. 
1. THE MECHANISM OF SUGGESTION 
In my little book on “les névroses” 1909, I have 
already studied the suggestibility of hysterics, namely 
that disposition to present in an exaggerated fashion 
the phenomenon of suggestion (p. 297). In my book 
on “les médications psychologiques” (I, p. 187) I de- 
voted a long study to the observations and interpre- 
tations of this phenomenon and here it will suffice to 
sum up the conclusions of those studies. 
Let us consider some typical cases of suggestion, 
choosing the simplest phenomena that appear spon- 
124 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
THE UTILIZATION OF AUTOMATISM 125 
taneously and accidentally in the course of neuroses 
before studying the experimental or therapeutic sug- 
gestions which are the most complex and most sus- 
ceptible of a false interpretation. A young man of 
nineteen, Nof, fell from time to time into certain 
bizarre states and when he was in this condition be- 
came unable to resist tendencies that certain impres- 
sions aroused in him. Thus, as he himself tells and 
as his parents observed, during one of these attacks, 
he passed by a hat shop one day and said to himself, 
“Hullo, that’s a hat shop where they sell hats,” and 
he bought a hat for which he had no need. Another 
day, being in the same state, he passed by the Lyons 
station and said to himself, “This is a railway station, 
you go in here to take a trip”; he entered the station 
and, reading on the bulletin board the name of Mar- 
seilles, he bought a ticket for Marseilles, boarded the 
train, and it was not until Macon that he came to real- 
ize the absurdity of this journey and left the train. 
Mye, a young girl of eighteen, had had a great 
dispute with her father over the subject of her engage- 
ment. She talked very loudly and cried a long time 
until at last her voice became hoarse. She complains 
to her mother, weeping, that this quarrel has made her 
ill, for she must surely have broken a vocal chord. 
From this moment she is aphonic and at times com- 
pletely mute. Speech only returns at night during 
dreams and occasionally for a short period during the 
day when she becomes angry again; but when she con- 
sciously observes herself she can no longer articulate 
a single word aloud.
-P-A-G-E-134
  
  126 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
The psychological problem of suggestion consists in 
deriving common and essential characteristics from 
these facts. A first group of attempted explanations 
has a great importance from the historical view point, 
for it involves opinions that are, to my notion, the 
most widespread and the most troublesome and that 
have done most to confuse this topic. This first group 
of explanations centers about some definitions of sug- 
gestion that display only one characteristic of the fore- 
going facts, the psychological or mental characteristic 
of the phenomenon and refuse to be any more exact. 
This conception can be attributed to M. Bernheim, 
who, at least in his earlier writings, tried to give to the 
word suggestion an unlimited application. To him 
this word seemed a synonym for the old general terms, 
“thought, psychic phenomenon, fact of consciousness.” 
In the beginning this conception had its uses and it 
helped to establish the psychological character of the 
phenomenon, but if it had been continued, it would 
have done away with all interest in treatments by sug- 
gestion, which would then have been confused with 
the foregoing treatments by morale of any sort what- 
ever, and would not have added to the precision of our 
ideas. In reality this conception is very incorrect: it 
is easy to show that the word suggestion has always 
been applied to a particular and very definite phenom- 
enon. There should be also excluded the similar defi- 
nitions that confuse suggestion with the arousal of 
feeling, the provoking of thought or the association of 
ideas. Suggestion must likewise not be confused with 
error or with emotion. Suggestion may be accom-
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE UTILIZATION OF AUTOMATISM = 127 
panied by emotion, it may develop as a consequence 
of emotion, but it should not be confused with emo- 
tion. 
In my first work on suggestion I insisted on two 
points. I first tried to show that it was necessary to 
consider these phenomena from the single viewpoint 
of action, and next that it was necessary to consider 
the incomplete, unfinished character of these actions. 
The subjects are always active in any suggestion, even 
in the so-called negative suggestion in which they 
assume certain characteristic attitudes that are never- 
theless actions. But it is easy to see, even in the rec- 
ords that I have just summarized, to what an extent 
these actions are defective. Nof... buys a hat or 
boards a train as he has done before, but he does not 
consider this important detail, that just at this time 
he has no need for buying a hat or taking the train 
for Marseilles; the action fails absolutely in precision 
and suitableness for the occasion. This blundering is 
all the more striking because it is not consistent with 
the subject’s ordinary behavior or with his education 
or past experience. We are amazed at the follies of 
these persons and we say that they are carrying dis- 
traction very far indeed. The patients notice this as 
well as ourselves when they have come out of the 
bizarre state that accompanied these actions. “How 
could I have done such foolish things, I who am ordi- 
narily so economical? How could I have imagined that 
I broke a vocal chord, talking to my father in a room. 
I didn’t have any blood in my mouth and I did not 
suffer at all... .” It is because of this characteristic 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
    128 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
inappropriateness that the suggested acts are so often 
errors. The actions are not even in accord with the 
personal sentiments of the subject. It is curious to 
see an individual quickly accept and affirm with con- 
viction things that are opposed to the character, the 
tastes, the beliefs, that we knew him to have hereto- 
fore; he himself is astonished at what he has just done 
and he cannot believe that he is about to do what he 
would have refused to do a moment before. And 
finally, when the suggested action is completed, one 
often notices a fact which Beunis was one of the first 
to describe, namely, the forgetting of the suggestion 
and its execution. It is such considerations that have 
led me to this general conception: “Suggestion is a 
particular reaction to certain perceptions; this reac- 
tion consists in the more or less complete activation of 
the tendency that has been evoked, without this acti- 
vation being completed by collaboration with the 
whole personality.” 
In my last book, I think that I made this more clear. 
It is always a question of actions in connection with 
language, of those links between language and the 
action of the members that characterize will and belief 
and that may be called assent.1_ But it is not a ques- 
tion of a deliberated assent in which will and belief 
are not complete until after a certain period of delib- 
eration and reasoning. The examination of motives, 
the arousal and the comparison of other favorable or 
unfavorable tendencies are very incomplete or even

-P-A-G-E-137
  
THE UTILIZATION OF AUTOMATISM 129 
absolutely lacking. One knows individuals incapable 
of carrying on a discussion, who suddenly stop, either 
angrily repeating their own opinion or else appearing 
to accept completely without any modification their 
adversary’s opinion. Something of the same sort oc- 
curs in inner reflection; the subject suddenly abandons 
his deliberation or his unfinished reasoning and gives 
his complete assent to one or the other of the ideas 
expressed according to the chance reinforcement of the 
moment... . It is an abrupt return to the immediate 
assent, but after a beginning at reflection that remains 
incompleted. 
There is, indeed, underlying reflection, a primitive 
form of assent that exists only in the thought of primi- 
tive man, that constitutes even now the only voluntary 
activity of those who are called the mentally weak. 
With them the tendency called forth in verbal form 
struggles against other tendencies aroused at the same 
moment by circumstances, and, according to the degree 
of force or of tension, gains a victory over them or is 
inhibited, that is to say, drained by them. The act 
of affirmation or negation simply amounts to establish- 
ing or proving its victory or its defeat under a particu- 
lar form: “One wishes or believes what one desires.” 
All the influences that depend on actions exterior to 
the moment, on the authority of the persons present, 
of the subject’s previous experience, may, according 
to the chance of circumstances, play a part in direct- 
ing the assent in this or that way. I have described 
weak-minded patients of this type who could be made 
to believe any absurdity because they affirmed or de-  
-P-A-G-E-138
  130 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
nied anything whatsoever according to the impulse of 
the moment, without taking account of difficulties or 
of contradictions. With them will and belief exist only 
in the form of an immediate assent without any reflec- 
tion. 
Suggestible individuals are not always the mentally 
weak: in the majority of the circumstances of life they 
make a more or less skilful use of reflection: we expect 
them to behave in the same fashion now and they 
expect it of themselves. What is characteristic of sug- 
gestion is that, at a given moment, the subjects behave 
quite differently. They have a beginning of reflection 
in regard to the suggested idea; one often observes an 
attempt at deliberation or reasoning. But these at- 
tempts are not very prolonged and do not result in a 
decision that would adopt or reject the idea with com- 
plete consciousness. The idea left to itself develops 
independently in a form of immediate assent, it takes 
the shape of an impulse. Suggestion presents itself 
as the provocation of an impulse rather than as a 
deliberate resolution. 
How is such a transformation possible? I shall not 
again consider the conditions of suggestion which I 
have done elsewhere and I am disregarding interpreta- 
tions in terms of the hypertrophy of a tendency, in 
terms of concentration of the attention, in terms of 
exaggerated obedience, whose insufficiencies I have 
tried to demonstrate. We are dealing with individuals 
who from the nature of their constitution or from the 
fact of an accidental illness have very feeble powers of 
reflection, in whom reflection is always slow, difficult
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE UTILIZATION OF AUTOMATISM 181 
and brief. Under the influence of various circum- 
stances that determine fatigue or emotions, they have 
a momentary depression that renders them incapable 
of reflection and that leaves them for some time in- 
capable of anything more than an immediate assent. 
At the beginning of this chapter we have noticed two 
examples of such behavior. 
What is curious in this and what constitutes the 
essential discovery rhade by the magnetists and hyp- 
notists, is that we are able, by artificial means, thanks 
to certain methods that reproduce fatigue and emotion, 
to bring on this momentary depression experimentally 
and to use it for producing the impulses that we desire. 
The idea that we put into the mind at a favorable 
moment when the power of reflection is worn out, 
becomes the object of an immediate assent and is trans- 
formed into an impulsion. It is this experimental 
arousal of an impulsion that is the essential purpose of 
all the studies of hypnotists. 
{ 
2. CHANGES IN PSYCHIC STATES 
The psychological facts involved in the practice of 
hypnotism and even in the explanation of hypnotism 
are evidently less simple. We shall have to return to 
the consideration of hypnosis in connection with fluc- 
tuations of psychic tension; but a great number of 
facts observed in these states depend on modifications 
like those that we have observed in suggestion and are 
likewise connected with the artificial determination of 
automatic behavior. 
Psychological interpretations of hypnotism have  
-P-A-G-E-140
  132 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
been very numerous and often highly debatable. The 
hypnotic state is not characterized uniquely by sug- 
gestibility, for there are certain hypnoses in which 
suggestibility is, on the contrary, diminished and ap- 
pears to be less than during the waking period. Nor is 
hypnosis a state of sleep, for it often presents a very 
different activity from that of simple sleep. It is diffi- 
cult to avoid the identification already made by the 
old magnetists of hypnotic with somnambulistic 
states. I am forced to keep the opinion that I formerly 
expressed, that hypnotism, whatever may be the 
method of obtaining it, belongs in the group of som- 
nambulisms, just as suggestion belongs in the group 
of impulsions. 
We may go a little farther and construct a general 
idea of somnambulism. Somnambulism is a modifica- 
tion in the mental state of an unbalanced individual 
and this modification consists in extremely varied 
changes that are not the same in every individual. I 
once noted certain changes in the dominant sensibili- 
ties, in the nature and number of tendencies that can 
be aroused, in the extent of the field of consciousnss. 
I now think that to this should be added certain im- 
portant changes of psychic tension: often it is dimin- 
ished in hypnoses where the attention and the will are 
more feeble than during the waking state, where sug- 
gestibility is increased; sometimes, on the contrary, it 
is heightened and some artificial states are obtained in 
which the personal will is greater and suggestibility 
has disappeared. There are, moreover, in such states 
many other changes that we recognize imperfectly.
-P-A-G-E-141
    THE UTILIZATION OF AUTOMATISM 133 
But this is not sufficient, for such changes occur 
constantly in the course of life and do not cause som- 
nambulisms. This is because ordinarily these changes 
are slight or gradual or compensated for by other phe- 
nomena and they do not alter the continuity of the 
personal memory. Although I may be tired and de- 
pressed, I still remember what I was doing a little 
while ago when I was not tired and depressed. For 
different reasons, in which even suggestion may play 
a part, these modifications of mental states are accom- 
panied by a modification in the continuity of personal 
memories and by the appearance of alternating mem- 
ories. Thus somnambulism becomes for us a tempo- 
rary and fleeting transformation of the mental state of 
an individual capable of causing in him the dissocia- 
tion of personal memory. 
The definition of hypnotism is the natural result of 
this. There is a curious fact, observed, indeed, for the 
first time by Puységur: by methods whose action we 
do not always completely understand, we are able to 
cause similar transformation in certain individuals, to 
put them into a state of somnambulism. Hypnotism, 
which is a gradual outcome of the old animal mag- 
netism, is nothing more than the artificial production 
of somnambulism. It may be defined as a momentary 
and passing transformation in the mental state of an 
individual sufficient to lead to dissociation of the per- 
sonal memory and artificially caused by another. 
Fatigue of attention, exhaustion from emotion play 
a part in such artificial transformation. Certain intox- 
ications can in certain cases bring this about. Ether,  
-P-A-G-E-142
  134 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
chloroform, ethyl chloride have been used to bring 
about hypnotic sleep with some interesting results. 
These experiments are seldom made and would be 
worth repeating carefully. This might even be the 
beginning of a new form of hypnotism that could be 
independent of hysteria, whereas at present it is almost 
entirely dependent on this neurosis, or, if you will, on 
natural intoxication. 
Somnambulism is not only the arrest of normal per- 
sonality, it is also the development of other tendencies. 
In order to arrive at an hypnotic state, it is necessary 
that at the moment of depression induced by one of 
the preceding causes, there should be aroused and de- 
veloped tendencies compatible with this state. That 
is to say, tendencies that permit the patient to remain 
quietly in his armchair, to listen to his hypnotizer, to 
talk with him, etc., in a word, to maintain the position 
of an hypnotized person. Preceding séances, somnam- 
bulisms that have occurred spontaneously in many 
patients before these experiences, previous nervous 
crises accompanied by delirium and rambling speech, 
the ideas spread about through the public on the 
position of somnambulists, and, in addition to this, 
the suggestion of the hypnotist are the actual causes 
for the awakening of these indispensable tendencies. 
There is in all this an education of the subject which 
has been much ridiculed but which is inevitable. With- 
out any doubt it is ridiculous to train the subjects to 
address you familiarly during the hypnosis, for them 
to look wild-eyed or to hold your hand while constantly 
scratching your thumb nail. But these are the exag-
-P-A-G-E-143
  THE UTILIZATION OF AUTOMATISM 135 __— 
gerations of an excellent practice. Hypnotism is not 
only a subconscious state, but it is an artificial state 
brought about by the hypnotist and up Ir a certain 
point at the disposition of the hypnotist. f) It is neces- 
sary, therefore, that the latter should impart to the 
subject during this state the attitudes and tendencies 
for which he has need, and it would not be worth the 
trouble to bring about this state if the subject were to 
be as troublesome in it as during his conscious state. 
From this it results that there is in hypnotism, along 
with a greater complexity, something analogous to 
what we have noticed, There is in it an arrest, a sus- 
pension of the normal personal consciousness, a. modi- 
fication of that particular tension which we think of as 
the waking consciousness and which was in unstable 
equilibrium, and at the same time an appeal to, and a 
calling forth of other elementary tendencies whose ac- 
tivation is going to replace that of certain repressed 
tendencies. Sometimes it is another life, another char- 
acter, another memory that is evoked in place of the 
ordinary conduct. In order to bring about an hypnosis 
one still makes use of the disposition of certain tenden- 
cies to become automatically active on the occasion of 
the slightest stimulation. 
3. THE AUTOMATIC FUNCTIONING OF TENDENCIES 
This conception of suggestion and hypnotism pre- 
supposes several important psychological notions that 
the studies of the magnetists and hypnotists have 
helped to make more precise. In order that a sugges- 
tion may be able to bring about an action, in order 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  136 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
that a certain practice may reproduce a somnambulism, 
it is necessary, as we have just seen, that the subject 
should himself possess a disposition to perform this 
action which may be called a tendency. The notion 
of a tendency that gradually emerged from old studies 
of instincts, habits, characteristics, and faculties and 
was made precise by observations on reflex action, took 
on a great importance in the works of Ribot. To-day 
it plays a considerable part: in the interpretation of 
psychic phenomena. A tendency is a disposition of 
the organism to produce a series of particular move- 
ments in a definite order in consequence of a certain 
stimulation at a point in the periphery of the body. 
A pinch on the skin of the arm causes the withdrawal 
of the arm, the contact of the bolus of food on the 
pharynx causes swallowing. These are elementary ten- 
dencies. In higher acts much more complex tenden- 
cies are involved, but they remain subordinate to the 
same general laws. 
A certain number of tendencies are original and are 
written into the organism from birth. Many others 
are acquired in the course of life, for the execution 
of every action leaves after it a disposition to repro- 
duce itself, that is to say, a new tendency. Our be- 
havior is the result of the complicated functioning of 
a multitude of tendencies that are being constantly 
formed and modified. 
Not only do tendencies present a disposition to cause 
a series of movements in a determined order, but they 
must also possess a force able to produce this series of 
movements. Each tendency seems to be the reservoir
-P-A-G-E-145
THE UTILIZATION OF AUTOMATISM 187 
of a certain quantity of force corresponding to the 
complexity and importance of the act that it deter- 
mines. Some psychologists like Mr. MacDougall have 
maintained that only the fundamental and original 
tendencies contain a charge of force. 
For many years I have been accumulating records to 
show that every tendency, even the slowest and the 
smallest, possesses a certain charge without which it 
would be impossible to understand either the sugges- 
tions that cause it to function or the excitement caused 
by the arrest of this tendency. Doubtless this charge 
could have been acquired at the moment of the forma- 
tion of the secondary tendency by borrowing force 
from the more original tendencies, but the new ten- 
dency once established, this charge remains attached 
to it in a permanent way. 
When the tendency has been aroused by an appro- 
priate stimulation, its activation may take place in 
degrees that give rise to different psychic phenomena. 
Thus there is built up a structure of tendencies out of 
attention and interest, desire whose forms are so vari- 
ous, effort, consummation and triumph, the origin of 
joy. These different degrees appear definitely only in 
the activation of higher tendencies. The complica- 
tion and the perfection of these degrees of activation 
depend on the elevation of the tendency. To take 
only one example, the operation of the tendencies 
placed at the base of this psychological hierarchy, and 
which constitute the reflexes, may be explosive; it 
may be delayed in the somewhat higher tendencies, 
which, after being aroused, may discharge themselves
-P-A-G-E-146
  138 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
several times and be interrupted one or more times, 
at different stages. The inhibition of one tendency 
by another and above all their association and their 
codperation likewise present varying degrees of im- 
provement according to the degrees of this hierarchy. 
These diverse degrees of perfection first appear in 
different individuals according to their degree of evolu- 
tion. But they appear also in the same individual 
according to the temporary state in which we find him. 
The various degrees of psychic tension correspond to 
the various forms of activation that tendencies may 
take. The activation of a tendency after reflective 
deliberation is one of the highest stages of function, 
while activation after an immediate assent, without 
reflection, constitutes a degree inferior to the preceding. 
To evoke an impulse, which is the essential of sug- 
gestion, is not, indeed, any more than the activation 
of a tendency under a lower form, with a lesser degree 
of perfection in the place of a higher form of activa- 
tion. The reproduction of an hysterical crisis, of a 
somnambulism, of the attitude that the popular imag- 
ination holds in regard to somnambulists, is likewise a 
phenomenon of the same type. If, in a general way, 
we call automatic the activation of an inferior ten- 
dency that escapes from the control of superior ten- 
dencies and especially the provocation of an immedi- 
ate assent, instead of a reflective assent, we may say 
that the essential part of the treatments we are con- 
sidering is the provocation of automatic actions instead 
of superior and reflective actions. This characteristic 
of suggestion is found in many therapeutic methods
-P-A-G-E-147

where it is combined with other elements. It enters 
into education, into zsthesiogenies, into moral direc- 
tion. Studies in suggestion have played their part in 
the discovery of important psychological laws and, in 
addition, they have initiated a precise application of 
psychological laws to the treatment of the sick. 
4, THE POWER OF AUTOMATISM 
It is none the less strange that benefit is derived 
from the use of these methods. How can the provoca- 
tion of an action under an older and more primitive 
form be of use to the sick? 
In the beginning suggestion was thought to have a 
considerable and in some ways superhuman power that 
greatly surpassed that of the normal will. It was 
thought to be capable of causing physiological and psy- 
chological metamorphoses that the normal will was 
not able to effect. This belief was the point of depar- 
ture for extensive studies in the production of blisters 
through suggestion and in criminal suggestion. The 
old magnetists claimed to be able to stop or increase 
at will the flow of blood from wounds or incisions and 
since then it has been announced in many places that 
reddenings of the skin, swellings, local rises of tem- 
perature, blistering, disappearance of warts had been 
brought about solely by hypnotic suggestion. The 
exact verification of these facts, the discovery of their 
causation would be of the greatest interest in proving 
the power of suggestion. Unfortunately science has 
not arrived at a definite conclusion on any of these 
points. Certain curious and even striking observa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
tions are announced from time to time, but no one 
succeeds in verifying the experiment on another sub- 
ject and under conditions whose control is open to 
no reproach, and there only remains the memory of 
a strange fact that has not entered into the domain of 
science. If such phenomena exist it is probable that 
they are dependent on a particular state of the circula- 
tion and of the skin analogous to that observed in 
dermographism and that suggestion proper only plays 
an accessory role. 
The so-called criminal suggestions present us with a 
like problem in regard to moral conduct. It has been 
claimed that these suggestions rapidly caused terrible 
transformations in the mind and forced a person to 
commit acts that he would never have considered 
otherwise. These experiments should have proved in 
a very definite way the extraordinary power of sug- 
gestion. The critics did not hesitate to point out that 
these experiments with imaginary crime did not signify 
anything because the subjects were perfectly aware of 
their lack of seriousness and would not have carried 
them out if the situation had been more serious. They 
finished by declaring that criminal suggestion did not 
exist. One of these two conclusions seems to me to be 
as false as the other because of the lack of psychological 
analysis. It is true that the experiments of magnetists 
begun again at Nancy without any criticism were of 
no great significance. The execution of an idea in the 
form of acting, of a pretense, of a falsehood, is only 
a start at execution and in the tendencies that thus 
develop there is only a feeble degree of tension. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE UTILIZATION OF AUTOMATISM 141 
is the reason, as we know, that neurotics of feeble 
psychic tension delight in falsehood, pretense and 
acting. 
But it would be very wrong to conclude from this 
that in other conditions and in certain subjects, crim- 
inal and dangerous acts could not be brought about 
by the mechanism of suggestion. It is enough to ex- 
amine the conduct, the real acts of patients, to be con- 
vinced that there are certain moments in their lives 
when accidental suggestion or even wilfully evil-inten- 
tioned suggestions, determine serious acts and even 
actual crimes. When I made a study of these facts 
I collected very definite cases in which real acts of 
misdemeanor were caused in this way. But one should 
not relate these observations without adding immedi- 
ately that these were cases of very seriously ill pa- 
tients, presenting all kinds of neuropathic accidents, 
having no personal will and incapable of directing 
themselves or resisting. The interesting problem from 
the medico-legal point of view consists in discovering 
whether with these patients suggestion was a more 
efficacious and dangerous procedure than the per- 
suasions and threats usually employed. From the psy- 
chological viewpoint it is evident that suggestion is 
not operating alone, that carrying out the crime de- 
pends on a disordered will as well as on suggestion, 
and that these facts, interesting as they may be, do not 
demonstrate an extraordinary power in suggestion. 
Many of the apparent marvels in the suggestion of 
paralysis, of contracture, or of character transforma- 
tion are more often marvels of hysteria than they are
-P-A-G-E-150
  142 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
the effect of our suggestions. In a word, suggestion 
does not seem to determine bodily and mental acts 
or modifications superior to those that the normal will 
can ordinarily realize. Moreover, there is nothing sur- 
prising in this since suggestion simply determines will 
and belief in a more elementary form without the 
perfection that reflective deliberation brings to them. 
All that we discover in the suggested acts are the char- 
acteristics of this elementary will, acts possibly more 
violent, more obstinate, in certain cases stronger con- 
victions, but in the end acts of will and belief that 
maintain the general character of such acts. Even 
marvellous transformations brought about by the hyp- 
notice state have been believed, and artificial somnam- 
bulists were credited with extraordinary psychic 
powers. We have had to give up most of these illu- 
sions and admit that the hypnotic state does not add 
any new power superior to the normal activity of men. 
We can no longer demand from suggestion or hyp- 
nosis acts that go beyond the powers of the normal 
human will. But is it really a question of this, and 
could we not content ourselves with acts that simply 
surpass the actual will of the patient? Precisely the 
individuals on whom hypnotic suggestion has an effect 
are the depressed neuropaths who present all sorts of 
disorders of the will and who often suffer from the 
inability to act. They do not know how to begin an 
action, or to continue it, and from this follow all their 
various paralyses, their inability to walk, to speak, to 
eat, to look, to sleep, etc.... If they attempt to 
perform these acts they experience all sorts of troubles,
-P-A-G-E-151
THE UTILIZATION OF AUTOMATISM 148 
emotion, anguish, tics, excitement of a thousand kinds, 
and these troubles are only by-products of their inabil- 
ity to realize the complete execution of the act that 
has been started. In other cases they cannot stop 
an action and they suffer from impulsions resulting 
from the involuntary development of tendencies for- 
merly aroused which continue in the form of inoppor- 
tune action; from this result convulsions, crises and 
various forms of delirium. It is not from such sub- 
jects as these that one must expect acts of a super- 
human will; it would be quite enough to help them 
to perform acts that the average human will can suc- 
ceed in accomplishing easily, and this would immedi- 
ately do away with a great many of their sufferings. 
Suggestion, of course, will not give them back a 
will that is lacking. “Just as one cannot suggest to an 
individual to be suggestible when he is not, one cannot 
suggest to a patient that he be not suggestible when 
he is; it is through automatic obedience that he will 
appear to obey you and he will not have regained the 
voluntary consent any more than the first will have 
lost it.”? No doubt acts thus determined will be 
impulsive acts and not acts of reflective will. They 
will not be so morally elevated. The moralist will be 
able to say indignantly: “These are not true actions; 
the cure is not voluntary; the patient does not feed 
himself; he is fed . . . to eat by hypnotic suggestion, 
that is not to eat.” This is somewhat puerile; do 
those patients eat any better who are fed by plunging 
a tube into the nose? They do take on weight, how- 
? Automatisme psychologique, 1889, p. 169.
-P-A-G-E-152
NST aaa il a i a a oa era | ee ea ae EC eT 
144 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
ever, and the patients fed by suggestion do the same. 
Doubtless this is not an ideal method of feeding, but it 
is feeding all the same. When the patient will have 
regained his strength and will be able to help himself, 
he will be able, perhaps, to perform more elevated 
acts—but in the meantime he is a patient and we must 
be content with those acts he can perform. 
I even grant that acts thus performed have real 
faults; not having been reflected upon, they are less 
adapted to reality, to the present situation. They are 
much less assimilated to the personality, they leave 
few memories and do not serve to build up character. 
But some of these faults are minimized in medical 
suggestion because the act is not chosen by the sub- 
ject but by the physician, who is capable of a reflective 
decision. The suppression of personal assimilation 
during a period of illness and of treatment has not any 
great harmfulness and can sometimes have its advan- 
tages. 
One general remark closes the discussion. This is 
that some automatic acts brought about in this fashion 
offer great advantages for the patient. First, certain 
of these acts have physiological consequences that are 
for the most part independent of the way in which 
the act may have been performed. We have just no- 
ticed this in regard to eating, and it will be the same 
for other functions, for defecation, micturition, for the 
genital functions and even for sleep and awakening. 
One can see in one of my old records, that of Marceline, 
how in certain cases it is possible to maintain life arti- 
ficially in patients by thus establishing functions in    
-P-A-G-E-153
  
THE UTILIZATION OF AUTOMATISM — 145 
an automatic fashion.? Conversely these suggested 
acts may have an inhibiting force and arrest other 
dangerous automatic actions that the will did not 
arrest. The suggestion of eating and retaining food 
will be able to stop vomiting; suggestions of move- 
ment and of breathing will be able to arrest choreas 
and disordered breathing. To reéstablish a normal 
activity is often to suppress a great number of acci- 
dents that have depended on forms of excitement and 
its consequences. 
A tendency that is not in action grows enfeebled, 
diminishes and becomes more and more rebellious to 
the will. Members that remain paralyzed for a long 
time, even though they do not become actually atro- 
phied by a nervous lesion, become thin and present a 
lowering of peripheral temperature, a fact to which I 
called attention long ago and which is beginning to be 
admitted to-day. Persistent contractures cause retrac- 
tions and adhesions that become irreducible. Even the 
automatic realization of movement is excellent for 
preventing these alterations from taking place. The 
function thus set in motion will be preserved, will be 
easier to activate when the will later on attempts to 
intervene, which it will not delay in doing. 
There is in this automatic exercise of the function 
that is finally perceived by the subject, an element 
which is, more than any other, capable of augmenting 
the psychic tension and increasing the power of the 
will, namely, the assurance of success. All the moral- 
izing healers repeat unceasingly that it is necessary 
* Etat mental des hystériques, 2nd edition, 1910, p. 545.
-P-A-G-E-154
  146 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
to remove from the patient’s mind the idea that he is _ 
paralyzed, that he must be given the conviction of 
power, and they employ the most marvellous argu- 
ments to establish this. Is there a single one of these 
arguments that is worth as much to the patient as the 
direct assurance that his action is realized? Thirty 
years ago, in my book on automatism, I cited the curi- 
ous record of Vg. This woman of thirty, after a pro- 
longed sojourn in bed, presented a complete para- 
plegia. While she was talking with M. Piazecki, who 
had presented her to me, I succeeded in making various 
suggestions to her by distraction and in making her 
get up and walk. After a moment she herself perceived 
her action and uttered a cry of joy at seeing herself 
upright and walking. “I am cured.” Confidence being 
restored to her she began to walk voluntarily. Is there 
any rational demonstration that can have such power? 
This consideration may be applied to all the ten- 
dencies that suggestion can activate. Even the auto- 
matic arrest of a host of anxieties, of despairing feel- 
ings that are, more often than is recognized, in the 
nature of pathological conduct and of delirium, the 
development, even though automatic, of a feeling of 
confidence and of hope put the mind into a better 
condition to regain its calm and force, and many fine 
sermons would be necessary to obtain a minimum part 
of these results. Doubtless in all these cases, sugges- 
tion has not accomplished any marvels and has done 
nothing that outstrips the normal human activity. 
But it has made it possible to bring about acts which 
the patient’s disintegrating will could no longer per-
-P-A-G-E-155
  THE UTILIZATION OF AUTOMATISM 147 
form, and, thanks to these methods, it has prepared the 
way for the restoration of the whole mind. 
We may approach the hypnotic state in the same 
way. If we must now give up expecting of it the 
development of marvellous and superhuman powers, 
can it not render more humble services? First of all” 
hypnotism, or provoked somnambulism, is a change of 
mind, of the state of consciousness in the patient. It 
is, even by definition, a very considerable change since 
it is characterized by a rupture in the subject’s mem- 
ory. Now a great change of this kind, in the midst of 
this indefinitely prolonged neuropathic state when the 
mind is becoming fixed in dangerous habits, must be 
of great use. This was formerly so well known that 
attempts were made to provoke attacks of hysteria 
in order to modify a dangerous pathological equilib- 
rium. It is evident that hypnotism arrives at the same 
results with less expense. ae 
From another viewpoint, hypnotism being a different 
state from that of the waking consciousness, certain 
tendencies arrested during the normal state may again 
become active during hypnosis. This change has been 
made use of in many ways, as a means of repose, as a 
means of restoring lost memories, as a procedure per- 
mitting the increase of tension by greater stimulation 
and especially as a means of developing suggestion. 
All such treatments derived from hypnotic sugges- 
tion not only do not deserve to be criticized from a 
moral viewpoint, as they have been, but they even 
seem to me to have an interesting and scientific value. 
They are psychological treatments, as is the medical 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  148 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
use of morale, but they are psychological treatments 
that have already become more precise and more sci- 
entific. It is no longer a question of an involuntary 
and unconscious appeal to the powers of thought as 
in miraculous treatments and as in “Christian Sci- 
ence.” It is no longer a question of a vague utilization 
of all the psychological facts mixed into a theriac. It 
is a question of a conscious and willed utilization of a 
definite psychological fact. Whoever tries to make 
the suggestion is not content with obtaining some 
moral effect, whatever it may be. He tries to bring 
about a certain phenomenon which, perhaps, may be 
difficult to recognize in practice, but whose character- 
istics, at least in theory, are sufficiently precise and 
distinct from any other psychological phenomena. 
Hypnotic suggestion seems to me to have been the 
first precise psychological treatment and it will have 
prepared the way for all the others by leading us away 
from indefinite moralizing. To-day the study of hyp- 
notism is suffering an eclipse. This is an historical 
event whose origin I have tried to explain elsewhere 
and one, moreover, that has already happened several 
times. But it is very likely that this study will re- 
appear under the same or under a related form, for it 
contains the germ of important therapies.
-P-A-G-E-157
  CHAPTER III 
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 
Therapeutic efforts often constitute real psycholog- 
ical experiments and bring to light facts that observa- 
tion alone has not discovered. If the research on sug- 
gestion and hypnotism has given a precise notion of 
certain tendencies, including that of psychological 
automatism, other therapies seem to have brought out 
important notions in connection with psychological 
forces and the expenditure of such forces. 
1. THE PROBLEM OF EXHAUSTION 
The curative methods of Weir Mitchell and his imi- 
tators were based on an identification of neuropathic 
disorders with the disorders brought on by fatigue. 
Many such patients have a very distinct feeling of 
fatigue and often carry this feeling to extremes in 
transforming it into a severe obsession. Is one not 
justified in believing them and accepting the rest treat- 
ment that they instinctively and insistently demand, 
providing we make it more intelligent and more com- 
plete? 
Doubtless, the beginning of this discussion is the 
right place for a criticism of the use of the word fatigue. 
Fatigue is really a part of normal behavior and not a 
disturbance of health. Fatigue is nothing more than 
149
-P-A-G-E-158
  150 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
the behavior of a man who is resting and the feeling 
of fatigue is nothing more than a certain stage in the 
activity of that tendency, the desire for the behavior 
of rest. At different stages of the psychological hier- 
archy there will be immediate beliefs in fatigue, reflec- 
tive certitude, and systematic convictions of fatigue. 
The feeling of fatigue is far from being proportional 
to the real decrease in strength. It can exist to the 
extreme degree in individuals who still have much 
strength, but who suffer from indecision. It may dis- 
appear in individuals who are really sick, although 
they have exhausted their reserves. In a word, there 
will be obsessions and hallucinations of fatigue, like 
certain hallucinations of sadness and certain hallucina- 
tions of joy. When dealing with pathological disorders, 
it is much more correct to use the word “exhaustion” 
to indicate that whole group of disorders of conduct 
brought on by the execution, the continuation or the 
repetition of acts, disorders that normal fatigue would 
have been able to avoid by stopping the activity, but 
that, in these pathological cases, fatigue has been 
unable to suppress. 
Everyone understands the notion of the exhaustion 
of a function where it concerns a physical function 
whose activity one sees diminish. It is easy to say 
that the function of lactation will be exhausted when 
the nurse’s milk is seen to fail. But it is much more 
difficult to apply that notion to psychological func- 
tions because they are still too much thought of as spir- 
itual, and not measurable, and because we are entirely 
ignorant of the forces that they set to work. The study
-P-A-G-E-159
  FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 151 
of electric currents could never have been made if 
scientists had always refused to consider their effects 
or to make note of their variations before knowing the 
nature of electric forces. We should have the courage 
to speak of psychic forces, to note their diminution, 
their exhaustion or their growth, before knowing their 
nature and on what organ they depend. 
All my old studies on hysteria and on psychasthenia 
aimed to show that the most apparent symptoms, 
delirium, fixed ideas, obsessions, phobias, were in close 
dependence on disorders that were less apparent but 
more important in behavior. Excitement, hallucina- 
tory perceptions, feelings of incompleteness, were at- 
tached to the inadequacy of this or that psychological 
function, of higher or lower order. Patients could not 
continue or repeat an action without experiencing diffi- 
culties. Some felt pain in various organs; others had 
odd feelings that gave their acts a painful or even 
distressing appearance. They could not reach any 
decision, any conviction, any belief. They could come 
to no conclusion and could understand nothing clearly. 
These disorders were distinct in the severe cases; in 
the less severe cases they were more attenuated and 
exhibited themselves only in connection with the 
highest tendencies and the most difficult acts, but 
they always existed beneath the delirium and the 
phobias. There could, moreover, be demonstrated in 
these patients inadequacies of movement, disorders in 
the energy, the duration, and the repetition of acts, 
and inadequacies in all the physiological functions. All 
these symptoms could be summarized in the concep-
-P-A-G-E-160
  152 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
tion of a lack in psychic forces, however one interpreted 
the nature of these forces and their origin. The notion 
of exhaustion seems to furnish an interesting expres- 
sion of this insufficiency and for numerous authors 
neuroses have come to be diseases of exhaustion. 
Opposed to this interpretation and this mode of 
treatment we meet, on the same subject, a quite dif- 
ferent doctrine, of which Dubois might be considered 
the standard bearer because it is he who has given it 
the clearest expression and because the other authors 
have, in general, done nothing but repeat his teaching. 
In the presence of one of these patients who declares 
himself exhausted and who remains in bed for years, 
Dubois has an entirely different attitude. He is not 
at all willing to take such talk seriously. He merely 
points out in the conduct of such patients, a host of 
contradictions that prove the illusory nature of their 
feeling of fatigue. This man declares himself exhausted 
if he takes a hundred steps on the highway, and he 
walks about in his own grounds for hours; that woman 
says she is unable to give an hour’s lesson to children 
and she reads novels all day long. “In fact, the ques- 
tion is here one of a conviction of impotence following 
minor, actual sensation magnified by a pessimistic 
state of mind. There is no more need to recognize 
such fatigue than there is to be concerned at the slight 
ailments of hypochondriacs.” 
These remarks seem justified, but their bearing 
should not be exaggerated. I agree that an obsession 
of fatigue does not prove the reality of the exhaustion, 
but neither does it prove the latter’s absence. There 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 153 
  are subjects obsessed by the idea of syphilis who do 
not have that disease at all; but there are also sub- 
jects obsessed with the idea of syphilis who really have 
syphilis; a real disorder may become the point of de- 
parture of an obsession. Moreover, this argument does 
not decide the question at all; it merely imposes on us 
certain precautions. For the study of exhaustion 
among neuropaths we should avoid choosing patients 
who have obsessions on that subject. We should take 
patients who have other obsessions, other phobias, or 
other symptoms, whatever they may be, and we should 
try to discover whether they really have, unwillingly 
or at least without being particularly preoccupied with 
them, real disorders of behavior independent of the 
ideas they have of it, and then whether these disorders 
can be identified with those that accompany 
exhaustion. 
As a matter of fact, in order to apply such observa- 
tion of the contradictions of conduct to diagnosis it 
would be necessary to take one essential precaution 
that the authors do not mention. It would be neces- 
sary to be able to establish that the two acts compared 
were of the same level, that they present the same 
psychological difficulty, and that they do not differ 
from each other except that the idea of fatigue is added 
by the subject to one of them and not to the other. 
But this is very hard to establish and seems to me 
impossible in precisely those conditions that have been 
mentioned. M. Dubois speaks of a woman who de- 
clared herself incapable of giving an hour’s lesson to 
some children and who when alone read countless
-P-A-G-E-162
    154 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
novels, and he sees a contradiction in this. I can see 
none, because for me the act of giving a lesson to some 
children is a complex act requiring a high tension, 
while the act of reading a small novel in solitude is an 
act that is very simple and requires little energy; for 
a subject with an agoraphobia, the act of walking on 
the street is not at all the same as walking in an 
enclosed yard, and if one analyses more carefully the 
nature of such observed acts, he will usually see these 
apparent contradictions vanish. 
From time to time, compelled by the evidence of 
facts, these authors are quite willing to recognize a 
truth on which I have long insisted, namely, that real 
psychic insufficiency manifests itself in conduct under- 
neath the visible accidents, and that such insufficiency 
does not depend on the ideas of the sufferers or on 
their auto-suggestions. They, however, fail to recog- 
nize the importance of such disorders and present them 
as results of the emotional state rather than as signs 
of exhaustion. This raises the interesting psycholog- 
ical problem of the comparison of emotion and 
exhaustion. 
From the point of view of symptoms there is no 
perceptible difference between emotion and fatigue. 
These two phenomena are psychic states of mild de- 
pression in which there is inadequacy and excitement. 
It might be said, moreover, that in current speech one 
speaks rather of fatigue when he notices more the first 
characteristic, the inadequacy, and he speaks more 
particularly of emotion, when the second characteristic, 
the consequent excitement, is more in evidence. The
-P-A-G-E-163
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 155 
difference between the two states from the point of 
view of symptoms is thus very slight, if it exists at all. 
Happily there is a second point of view, usually 
taken by common sense in order to distinguish between 
emotion and exhaustion. These are states quite sim- 
ilar in their symptoms which seem to arise under dif- 
ferent conditions. Emotion is a disorder that seems 
to arise at the moment a situation is perceived, that 
seems to develop before action, that seems even to 
inhibit action; fatigue is a disorder that seems to us 
to develop later on, after action, and especially after 
intense and repeated action. This is imagined to be a 
marked difference; in reality it is insignificant enough, 
but it suffices in practical speech. If we now take this 
point of view, can we say that the depression in neu- 
roses is more closely related to emotion than to fatigue? 
It is true that pathological disorders in the form 
of depression often have an origin like that of the emo- 
tions; they begin in connection with a perception that 
has been followed by very inadequate and poorly 
adapted action. Nevertheless, the comparison with 
fatigue is, to my notion, still more indicated. In a 
first group of facts it can be asserted that nervous dis- 
eases with depression are produced under conditions 
that are identical with those that bring about fatigue, 
that is to say, after the execution of the action when 
work has been too prolonged, too intensive, or too 
hurried, whether it is a matter of physical work or of 
mental work. It has been easy for me to collect exam- 
ples of this in great number. In other cases, still more 
illuminating, neuropaths whose balance has been re-
-P-A-G-E-164
    156 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
established by a rest cure relapse into serious illness 
under circumstances that bring about only fatigue in 
other men. All actions that are a little difficult or a 
little prolonged, although they seem to be correctly 
performed, that is, without having been arrested or 
disturbed by the consequences of emotion, bring about 
relapses, a reappearance or a considerable aggravation 
of pathological symptoms. 
In all the foregoing records the patients had no ob- 
session, no fatigue phobia; before my observations they 
were even completely ignorant of the réle that fatigue 
played in their relapses. Hence their disorders could 
not be explained by a fixed idea of fatigue. We are 
the ones who have happened to notice, by observing 
their depression and the circumstances in which it 
occurred, that these disorders consisted in an inability 
to exercise certain tendencies following a too prolonged 
exercise of those same tendencies, in other words, that, 
with due regard to proportion, they were like the phe- 
nomena that we call exhaustion. 
Hence, if we consider its apparent beginnings, the 
depression of neuropaths is as closely related to fatigue 
as to emotion. Furthermore, there is a question 
whether we are right in opposing these two mechan- 
isms one to the other. The disorder seems to develop 
after the performance of the act in fatigue; in emotion 
it seems to appear before the performance and even 
to prevent the performance of the act. This is not 
quite correct. At the moment of appearance of the 
exciting circumstance, the individual makes efforts to 
act, that is, he mobilizes great forces; he directs them
-P-A-G-E-165
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 157 
poorly; doubtless he carries out no useful act and even 
seems to make no useful movements; but he really 
begins a crowd of actions that are indicated at the 
time. If I am not mistaken, the beginning of the 
emotional disorder is analogous to that of the dis- 
order of fatigue. In the two cases depression occurs 
following an expenditure of strength required by cor- 
rect or incorrect action, and we are forced to agree 
with those men who have held that it was justifiable 
to classify the depression of patients with phenomena 
like those of fatigue and exhaustion, whatever its origin 
may be. 
2. MENTAL EXPENDITURES 
This interpretation of nervous disorders in terms 
of the exhaustion of strength that is involved in psy- 
chic acts is often complicated by misunderstandings. 
The most serious come from the two different lan- 
guages that are used successively or simultaneously 
when disorders of conduct are mentioned. Sometimes 
one uses the old psychological language and says: the 
patient is sad and restless; he takes fright at every 
act he must perform; the least effort seems to him a 
mountain to be lifted; he has no longer any resolution 
or choice; he has no more will; he suffers from an 
aboulia. This language, otherwise very vague, seems 
to have a moral significance and to imply a certain 
shade of reproach; it lets it be understood that the 
patient could be different if he wished. When one uses 
physiological or pseudo-physiological language, he 
says: the functions that preside over the formation of
-P-A-G-E-166
  158 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
nervous force are altered; there is a decrease in the 
production of nervous impulses; this patient has a 
nervous weakness; he is an asthenic. Such language 
seems to grant that there is present a physical lesion 
independent of the mind, and that the patient can do 
nothing about it. The patients, moreover, prefer the 
second expression to the first. 
As a matter of fact there is here nothing but a play 
on words: the diminution of will, that is, the diminu- 
tion of a higher function that demands force under 
great tension, cannot exist without a change of nerv- 
ous tension and probably also of the quantity of force. 
Conversely, there cannot be weakness of nervous func- 
tions without disorder in the psychic acts that express 
them, and without alteration of the higher will. Such 
nervous disorders, moreover, cannot to-day be directly 
verified: they are known only through the interpre- 
tation of disorders of action. All these pseudo-physio- 
logical expressions are only poorly made translations 
of psychological observations. Here we find again the 
same poor pleasantry that once played a certain part 
in connection with the theories of hysteria. At that 
time a physiological theory of hysteria was readily 
formulated by saying: “the memory center is con- 
gested”: in place of saying “this patient displays some 
failure of memory.” As a matter of fact such terms 
borrowed from the language of consciousness and the 
terms borrowed from the language of physiology are 
almost equivalent and it would be well to do away 
with the misunderstanding by suppressing both. We 
shall some day describe mental disorders solely in terms
-P-A-G-E-167
  FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 159 
of action and conduct. The psychology of behavior 
so useful in the study of animals should be applied to 
men also by describing even the higher psychic phe- 
nomena in terms of conduct. 
Another difficulty comes from the complexity of 
human conduct: the disorders that involve the vigor, 
the number and the duration of actions are readily 
enough connected with the notion of quantity and can 
be described as diminutions of psychic force, like the 
asthenias proper. The disorders that have to do with 
the psychological perfection of acts, that suppress the 
higher operations while they deliver their force to the 
lower, suggest the idea of a disturbance in psychic 
tension. But it is to-day very hard, first, to make a 
clear diagnosis of these two classes of disorders and, 
second, to point out the laws that rule the quantitative 
relations and the relations of psychic tension. It is 
this difficulty and this misunderstanding that have 
delayed the study of an important problem, the prob- 
lem of the budget of the mind, the study of psychic 
disbursements and receipts and their balance. 
One point that would be very important in the study 
of psychoses would be to know exactly what are the 
acts that cause fatigue. When the question is one of 
domestic economy we know very well what goods are 
dear and what cheap, what operations are expensive 
and what are inexpensive, and we can easily establish 
our household budget. We are, on the contrary, quite 
incapable of establishing the budget of our mental 
activity because we have only very vague notions on 
the cost of this or that action. Ordinarily this is no
-P-A-G-E-168
  160 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
great inconvenience because men in good health have 
almost always more than enough mental force for their 
expenditures. But among the unfortunate invalids 
who need to economize their activity this question 
becomes important. Déjérine was right when he said 
that the acts accompanied by emotion are the most 
depressing. This is not because the emotion is a cause 
of depression—it is itself the depression—it is because 
these are difficult and costly activities that bring about 
in some persons rapid depression even during the act 
that is the emotion, and bring about in others that 
postponed depression after the act that is called fa- 
tigue. The question always comes back to the same 
point: what are the actions that cause the most depres- 
sion in neuropaths? 
In general it is hard to know this, for we have not 
sufficient knowledge of the mental state of each pa- 
tient, the previous acquisitions that render this or that 
performance more or less habitual, the attitudes he 
takes for performing an act. We can only distinguish 
certain signs. The first point, the most readily estab- 
lished, is that there are circumstances of life, always 
the same, which for successive generations set the same 
problems, which demand difficult acts, and which are 
for numberless persons the occasion for a breakdown 
and mental disease. There is good reason sometimes 
for being able to imagine a disease of the first com- 
munion, the disease of betrothals, the disease of the 
wedding journey, the disease of mothers-in-law. The 
physician should not consider beneath his dignity the 
study of these circumstances and their enumeration 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 161 
which I can make here only in a rough way will be 
later, I am sure, the object of exact studies and rea- 
soned classification. 
I have tried to enumerate the events of life that 
were the occasion for neuropathic disorders in a large 
number of patients. I studied in that connection the 
first communions, the exercises that brought about 
religious emotion, the entrance into social life, drawing- 
rooms, schools, examinations. “My fatigue began in 
connection with difficult acts, religious and moral be- 
liefs that I hesitated to keep or suppress... . It is so 
fatiguing to think about life, one’s career, the world 
that one must see and that one detests.. . . I am so 
afraid of thinking!” Another patient told me: “It 
was at seventeen that I noticed that I thought, and 
that has been so painful to me that I should have liked 
not to go on.” The passage from infancy to youth 
demands not only an expenditure of physical force for 
the new organization of the body and the preparation 
of the functions of reproduction, it demands also exten- 
sive and difficult moral adaptation. It is the period 
when all the problems of life obtrude themselves at 
once and sometimes brutally, problems of love, of for- 
tune, of occupation, of society, of religion, and it is 
as the result of efforts to solve these problems that 
there appears that “fear of life’ so common at the 
onset of mental diseases in young people. 
Life’s changes, voyages, even the organization of 
vacations are often the causes of exhaustion. Work, 
the occupation necessary for earning a living, demands 
* Les médications psychologiques, II, p. 42.  
-P-A-G-E-170
  162 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
of nearly everyone a great expenditure of force. Fam- 
ily life, the reciprocal adaptation of persons who live 
together in the same house is analogous to the pro- 
fessional adaptations, and I believe that that adapta- 
tion and its deficiencies are of the greatest importance 
in mental medicine. 
Difficulties and expenditures are much more serious 
when there is any change in ordinary life. There is 
even more reason why risks and contests of all sorts 
in the family and the professional environment should 
cause more serious upsets. The death of relatives is 
the occasion for many mental diseases. Such a death, 
indeed, transforms the environment in which the sub- 
ject lives; it imperiously demands new adaptations and 
there are disorders brought about by such effort that 
we refer to as “the emotion of the death of relatives.” 
Love affairs, engagements, marriages, demand spe- 
cial acts that add their expenditures to those that have 
preceded. It is not merely a question of the act of 
generation, we must also reckon with the act of adapta- 
tion to household life which is usually overlooked, and 
which is as important as the first. The effort of adapta- 
tion to the character of the mate, the organization of 
a certain degree of intimacy and the resulting fatigue 
seem to me to be the origin of those disorders, as fre- 
quent as they are peculiar, that are so often observed in 
the beginnings of household life in young married 
people. 
If their unions make them ill, it must not be thought 
that their separation would take place without acci- 
dents. Infidelities, divisions of affection, secret love
-P-A-G-E-171
      FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 163 
affairs bring on many complications, difficulties, 
doubts, and in their train many nervous troubles. 
The education of children is a great source of effort, 
emotion and fatigue. The children once married, calm 
does not necessarily return, for the parents find them- 
selves isolated, and this brings a change and again 
demands a painful adaptation. Giving up work and 
retirement set problems of the same kind and we find 
ourselves finally confronted by all the depressions of 
old age. These depressions come from many causes; 
but, more often than is believed, they are still attached 
to the difficulties of life and action: “I do not know 
how to be old any more than I knew how to be young.” 
said a fine old man who suffered all his life from timid- 
ity and mental depression. Thus all the stages of the 
road of life offer hills to climb and at each hard ascent 
the carriage encounters obstacles and the incompetence 
and weakness of the poor traveler is made evident. 
In all these cases, exhaustion is not simply the result 
of great expenditure of movements. Simple move- 
ments, even when they are repeated, rarely brings about 
exhaustion, and depressed persons have not always lost 
the physical strength of movements. We shall rather 
find the origin of such exhaustion in considering the 
work of adaptation and the nature of the acts that are 
required of the subject by the new situation in which 
he is placed. 
The complexity of situations is involved more often 
than one thinks. It is to be noted even in small details. 
Many exhausted neuropaths can follow a conversation 
if they are not alone with the speaker; they are dis-     
  
-P-A-G-E-172
  164 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
turbed and become ill if there are several persons pres- 
ent who are speaking at the same time. Others cannot 
speak except while they are eating or while they are 
walking: they are disturbed by a vehicle that passes 
while they are walking, by the least event that com- 
plicates their action. 
Another fact that plays an important réle is the 
rapidity of the action; removals, money losses, changes 
of situation are more dangerous when they are more 
rapid. But why should a rapid act cause more ex- 
haustion than a slow one? Is it not the same act? 
Probably not, since the results are so different. When 
a circumstance to which we are accustomed to respond 
with an appropriate but sluggish action so presents 
itself that it requires a rapid action, we cannot use 
the habitual tendency; we are forced to have recourse 
to exceptional measures, that is, to less organized meas- 
ures, and this increases suddenly the expenditure of 
force. It is quite probable that this unaccustomed and 
more rapid reaction will demand a greater tension, 
which is always very costly, at least at the start. But 
it may also happen that we find ourselves without an 
already organized reaction that is appropriate to the 
circumstance in question and more rapid. We are 
going to be forced to improvise, to have recourse to 
the primitive tendency, to the agitation that tries 
random movement in order to reach by chance a useful 
movement. There will be the emotion, the trouble, 
the disorder that is produced when one is too hurried: 
this elementary and clumsy process is quite ruinous. 
That which seems to me to play the most important 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 165 
réle is the duration, the prolongation of the activity. 
It is this that creates the danger in a particularly im- 
portant activity, namely waiting. Waiting is, in fact, 
a prolonged action. To wait, it is necessary to keep 
a certain tendency in a state of preparation, and it is 
necessary at the same time to inhibit the activation of 
that tendency for the act cannot yet be completely 
performed. Such work is always complex and difficult. 
I am inclined to say that a prolonged activity, reaching 
far into the future, is necessarily a superior activity 
of high tension. The psychic tension is related to the 
time and to the extension into the future; to demand 
an activity of long duration is to require a costly act 
of a high order. Whether it is a question of complex- 
ity, of rapidity, of duration, we always see that the 
chief difficulty of activity lies in the activation of 
higher tendencies. It is easy to see in our records that 
there are in fact acts of this sort which have presented 
difficulties and dangers. Religious practices, study, 
occupations, betrothals set problems of will and belief. 
Making decisions is as much involved in business as 
in the command of men or in marriage. The circum- 
stances in which one is compelled to choose between 
two opposed lines of conduct, practice or forbearance, 
the “yes” or the “no” of the betrothal, the husband or 
the lover, are especially typical. The feeling of re- 
sponsibility is nothing else than the lively representa- 
tion of motives when these imply serious consequences 
of action. All these circumstances demand and arouse 
the functioning of reflective assent which is properly 
one of these higher operations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  166 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
It is no less strange to find that some acts which 
are excellent in themselves, such as making decisions 
and performing work, bring on exhaustion. Acts of 
high tension are not ordinarily exhausting acts; on the 
contrary, they have as their object the reduction of our 
expenditure and the production of benefits. A definite 
decision simplifies behavior in the future and allows 
us to act later on with less outlay of strength. Acquir- 
ing a fortune or a science by means of work makes 
much easier certain later advantageous behavior. All 
this is true, but the good results of such acts are chiefly 
later benefits that do not eliminate the present large 
outlay. Such acts are like the purchase of a machine 
or a good bond: there will be later on some saving 
and some profit, but there is great expense at the 
time. There are purses that cannot stand even a fine 
investment without being quite emptied. There are 
minds that are not able to stand an activity which 
is excellent in itself and very advantageous for the 
future, but which demands too heavy an outlay. 
There is space for another remark as well: such sub- 
jects are far from succeeding in the complete accom- 
plishment of these acts of high tension. They only 
begin them and stop before having finished them; then 
they begin them over again in the same way, “hung 
up” on the same problem indefinitely. We have often 
observed this rumination that seeks a reflective assent 
without ever reaching it, these Herculean labors that 
push against a wall without accomplishing anything. 
The problem of psychic outlay, of the cost of ac- 
tivity, will in the future be one of the main problems
-P-A-G-E-175
  FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 167 
for psychology and for psychiatry: to-day it is hardly 
suspected. Usually is is thought to be easily answered 
by speaking of the psychic quantity of acts, of the 
strength of movements, of the complexity, speed and 
duration of movements, and by saying that the acts 
that involve energetic, numerous, quick, prolonged 
movements are the acts that bring fatigue. That is 
perhaps true, at least partially so, for normal fatigue, 
but it is quite insufficient for pathological fatigue, de- 
pression. Besides those characteristics having to do 
with psychic quantity there must be added those that 
depend on the hierarchical degree of elevation of the 
acts, of their psychic tension, and it must be under- 
stood that the accomplishment of acts of a high order, 
belonging to the order of reflection, or of work, whether 
they be carried out completely or incompletely, is still 
more capable of bringing on exhaustion and depres- 
sion than the accomplishment of acts of lower order. 
3. ECONOMY INVOLVED IN THE FEAR OF ACTION AND IN 
COMPLETE REST 
Such a conception of the réle of exhaustion in the 
neuroses necessarily brings in its train some precau- 
tions and special methods. 
Oftener than one would believe the remedy is 
pointed out to us by the patient himself. Not all the 
symptoms of a disease are signs of trouble; they are 
sometimes the result of the resistance of the organism 
and constitute the defence symptoms. We recognize 
many symptoms of that kind in visceral pathology 
where fever and congestion are often protective reac-
-P-A-G-E-176
168 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
tions. It is the same in mental pathology and it should 
be realized that certain modes of conduct of patients 
do not always have an absurd origin. 
Mental diseases are not always fatal affairs whose 
germ one carries in him and cannot avoid. They de- 
pend to a great extent on the life the subject lives 
and on the situation in which he is placed. Many per- 
sons have received through heredity a very weak men- 
tal constitution and would have succumbed if fate 
had not brought them a tranquil and easy life. Better 
still, there are subjects of that kind who are more or 
less aware of their weakness and who themselves 
habitually create an environment for their own use. 
They know how to find humble employment that de- 
mands neither great effort nor dangerous initiative. 
The ministries and the large government offices are 
often retreats for people who need a life ruled by 
superiors, without hard knocks and without responsi- 
bilities. They do not marry, they have no mistress, 
no children, they visit few persons, and they pay 
enormous attention to the choice of the rare individ- 
uals whom they permit to approach them: they live 
alone as much as possible in order to have no con- 
cessions to make. They spend little even when they 
are rich; they do not engage in any business, or enter 
into rivalry with anyone. Their precautions, their 
silence, for they know how to be silent about their own 
affairs, result in their being seldom exposed to attack. 
Moreover, they assume the appearance of not seeing 
or feeling evil and hide their heads like ostriches. If 
it is necessary, they stand attack; “they turn their
-P-A-G-E-177
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 169 
backs and let nails be driven in their shoulders” rather 
than fight. They know how to evade orders and re- 
quests. “When you jostle them they give way, they 
retreat into their shells or slip between your fingers, 
and no one can affect them.” The public calls them 
egoists and cowards. They are perhaps wise men. 
When these precautions which are directed at the 
economizing of action become still greater they de- 
termine symptoms that have a pathological aspect. A 
large number of phobias seem to attach to certain 
objects or to certain situations; the sufferers seem to be 
afraid of a knife, of a feather, of a telegraph instrument 
or of blushing. This is only so in appearance, for the 
phobia always has reference to an act and the sufferer is 
afraid of taking up the tools of his profession or of 
showing himself in public. The fatigue phobias show 
us a more general repulsion toward all activity. It is 
quite probable that many of these phobias have their 
occasion in finding some danger that threatens the 
depressed subject in work or reflective decision, that 
is, in the activation of higher tendencies. 
The renunciation of this or that activity, religious 
practices, the fine arts, study, or amorous sentiment 
which may be observed so clearly in certain psychas- 
thenics is an act of economy that is the result of a 
real feeling of poverty. The manias of adjustment, 
which are often very curious, bring about sharp rup- 
tures, the abandonment of a situation, or unconsidered 
sacrifices. The sufferers are often overcome by the 
foolish terror of a situation in which they find them- 
selves, and into which they have sometimes just placed
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
themselves. They think of one thing only and that 
is to rid themselves of the situation at any price. In 
the moral order this phenomenon is equivalent to 
the fugue, so common in neuropaths of all sorts, to 
that impulsion that drives them “to leave here at once, 
to go anywhere just so one will be here no longer.” 
Certain feelings that the sufferers experience in con- 
nection with their actions are of the same sort, some 
have the sense of sacrilege to an intense degree: “I 
would insult my mother if I ate as you ask... .I 
would torment my father in his grave, I would step 
on his corpse if I took this path... .” At a less serious 
stage the acts in question appear merely ugly, coarse, 
vulgar: “As soon as I put out my hand toward an 
object, it seems ugly: my movements are awkward and 
ridiculous . . . flowers wither if I look at them... . 
I cannot desire an object without having it become 
repugnant at the same moment... .” Finally a more 
diffuse form of this feeling is the thought of a catas- 
trophe: “If I think of renting an apartment in this 
house it seems to me that the beautiful and impressive 
entrance will be a very convenient place for my wife’s 
coffin... . If you lead me to expect a call from my 
mother, I am going to think of her as coming in deep 
mourning because of the death of my father, of my 
brother, of the whole family... . If I put on a new 
shirt, occult powers are going to send floods throughout 
Paris.” # 
These singular ways of representing action are 
*The Fear of Action. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, June, 
1921, p. 150.
-P-A-G-E-179
  FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 171 
closely related to the manias of perfection and of re- 
peated beginning so common in neuropaths. If they 
are not led to suppress the act entirely, as in the pre- 
ceding form, they are at least led to make efforts to 
transform that action, to make it less ugly and more 
moral. This is one of the most important origins of 
some manias of doubt. In extreme cases the effort 
to transform the repulsive action determines a ten- 
dency to avoid it and a less apparent impulse toward 
the act that is opposed to it. Some subjects make vain 
efforts to attain a modest behavior that might satisfy 
them, feeling in themselves terrific impulses toward 
the worst obscenities. One thinks of the old mystic, 
Bunyan, who, when he said his prayers, was forced 
to hold his jaw with both hands in order that his 
mouth might not open and utter blasphemies. 
All these phenomena are connected with the fear . 
of action that depends on a disorder of the strength 
and tension of our activity at the moment. In a nor- 
mal activity the energy mobilized for activating the 
tendency is sufficient and even overabundant. After 
the consummation of the action the unused forces drain 
into other tendencies and play an important réle in 
gaiety, the joy that crowns the act. It is this division 
of the forces. collected in overabundant quantity that 
constitutes the triumph after the act, the interest and 
the desire before the consummation. If the forces put 
at the disposition of a tendency are diminished to the 
point of being just sufficient for the expense of the 
action, the disappearance of this gratuitous excess sup- 
presses triumph, interest, and desire, and makes the 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  172 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
performance of the act a matter of indifference. If 
the forces at the disposition of an act are frankly in- 
adequate, the act is performed with parsimony, with 
a sort of avarice; the higher degrees of action are not 
attained and the act loses the characteristics that would 
be given it by reflection or energetic tendencies. For 
a man used to the higher forms of activity, an act 
of this sort is as disagreeable as lying on the bare 
ground when he is used to a good bed. An act that 
has lost the characteristics of the reflective act seems 
robbed of all that went to make up its security: it is 
as if we were asked to walk on a dangerous path with 
our eyes closed. Even more, such an act seems to 
exhaust our last resources; it reveals to us our wretch- 
edness, and wakes the thought of moral bankruptcy. 
It is this that provokes all those reactions of avoidance 
and terror. 
It is true that these feelings and these phobias are 
not always very accurate, and the part of the physician 
is precisely to understand these defence reactions, to 
restrain them when there is any occasion, and to direct 
and use them. It is clear that he must fight against 
phobias when they are exaggerated and dangerous. 
When one finds himself confronted with a patient who 
refuses to leave his room, who suffers anguish when 
he hears the act of generation mentioned, or who 
cannot begin an act of his profession without terror, 
it is necessary to make a psychological analysis. Is it 
a question of fear of the act determined by association 
of ideas, by interpretation, by the extension of an 
obsession or an hallucination, or is it a question of a
-P-A-G-E-181
  
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 173 
legitimate precaution against a difficult act that causes 
dangerous exhaustion? There is here a delicate diag- 
nosis that should be made in each particular case, and 
for which it is at present hard to give general rules. 
If the diagnosis shows that these fears of action are 
connected with a real exhaustion, it is clear that it is 
necessary to follow, doubtless changing it somewhat, 
the lead given by the patient, and with him seek to 
organize the economy of his inadequate psychic forces. 
The physicians who, following Weir Mitchell, have 
wished to organize rest treatments have sought to sys- 
tematize this economy of forces. Rest in bed seems a 
radical solution of the problem. The patient seems 
exhausted by an excessive activity; very well, we rest 
him by suppressing all activity whatever. The subject 
is not rich enough to pay the expense of the mode of 
life that he is leading. We do not look for what is 
excessive and ruinous in his expenses; we merely do 
away with all his expenses whatever they may be; we 
are certain that in this way he will have to save. 
This manner of procedure is not absurd, and there 
is a greater chance that it will be useful to the patient 
than the opposite method of absolute disregard of 
fatigue and imprudent expenditures. Most neuro- 
paths, whether or not they have obsessions of fatigue 
and phobias of action, are exhausted almost to bank- 
ruptcy. One will nearly always render them a service 
in imposing on them rest and the saving of strength 
in this fashion. I even believe that in practice, when 
it is a question of a patient very seriously affected, 
whose psychological analysis is still incomplete, and in
-P-A-G-E-182
    174 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
whom one cannot clearly discern the mechanism of the 
exhaustion, it is almost always good to keep him quiet 
in bed for a certain time. Rest in bed will certainly 
be useful in any case, and will permit a better under- 
standing of the psychological situation. We find the 
beneficial effect of this initial rest in a great number 
of records. 
Such complete repose in bed, however, such the- 
oretic suppression of all psychic waste by complete 
immobility, presents many difficulties, and, if it is 
much prolonged, even presents certain dangers. Many 
authors have criticised the “rest cure” and the “mast 
cure” by saying that “the increase of blood and of fat 
is not enough to bring about a normal condition of the 
nervous system, and is not enough to do away with all 
the disorders of thought.” I have shown elsewhere ® 
the difficulties in applying this therapy, the bad habits 
and the disorders that it can give rise to in certain 
cases; very often new obsessions and hypochrondriac 
delirium develop in individuals left too long to rest 
without enough moral direction. To rest, to really 
assume the attitudes of rest, is a difficult act that the 
exhausted patients do not know how to perform, even 
when they have need of it. Also, they conserve even 
in their bed very dangerous physical and mental excite- 
ment. 
These rest treatments in bed become especially hard 
to apply when the patient has emerged from the period 
of the complete exhaustion of his strength. One then 
sees the appearance of various forms of excitement 
* Les médications psychologiques, II, p. 89.
-P-A-G-E-183
  
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 175 
and the feeling of boredom. This feeling is hard to 
analyze and some interesting studies are now being 
made on the subject. If I am not mistaken this feeling 
does not appear in profound exhaustion, when the 
patient is “quite sufficiently occupied for a whole day 
in looking at a moving leaf.” Boredom is the sign of 
a certain restoration of a strength that is as yet in- 
adequate and poorly directed. It reduces to the group 
of the phenomena of excitement. 
One of the characteristics of the depressed individual 
is that he does not know how to save his strength with- 
out immediately expending it. He does not know how 
to form reserves, which is so important in mental econ- 
omy. The reserving of strength is connected with the 
organization of habits and of tendencies that cannot 
be established without giving them a charge for later 
use. The organization of these new tendencies, the 
preparation of their charge, are special psychological 
operations that are carried out with difficulty in the 
depressed. Their forces are spent from the time that 
they appear in incomplete acts, in vague desires imme- 
diately arrested, accompanied by disgust and fear of 
the act. In order to fight against excitement and 
disorder it is not always enough to augment strength 
by simple physical rest.* 
Economy through complete rest in bed is often the 
necessary beginning of treatment. It is almost always 
useful, but it is rarely enough. It is fantastic to pre- 
tend to suppress all the expenditures of a living being 
and to bring him to a complete cessation of all outlay. 
*Op. cit., II, p. 58.
-P-A-G-E-184
  176 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
The savings that one hopes to realize in this manner 
are often illusory, and if they exist they leave in the 
patient’s hands only poorly arranged resources with 
which he often does not know what to do. 
If it is understood that the good effects of the rest 
treatment are due mainly to the economy of psychic 
force, that treatment can be organized in a more ra- 
tional fashion. It will be no longer necessary, except 
in special cases, to suppress physical movement com- 
pletely and to reduce the patient to immobility. Some 
prudence in the expenditure of physical strength will 
be enough. The essential lies in discovering which acts 
give the patient difficulty and excessive expense, and 
in restricting or in suppressing precisely these costly 
acts. The rest treatment then takes on a new sig- 
nificance and is transformed into a treatment that is 
indispensable for neuropaths, treatment by the simpli- 
fication of life. 
The first point of this treatment consists in suppress- 
ing the perpetual efforts brought about by getting 
“hung up” or “caught” as the patients often say. It 
is necessary to free them, that is, to solve as far as 
possible the complex situations in which they find 
themselves and in which they are entangled, and one 
does not realize how many mental diseases that seem 
serious, disappear as soon as one puts an end to a deli- 
cate and difficult situation. 
It is not enough to “get out of a hole”; it is neces- 
sary to take precautions that the car does not get 
stuck again two steps farther on, and it is because 
of this that it must be put on a road without ruts and
-P-A-G-E-185
  FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 177 
rocks. In my first studies on the treatment of hysteria 
in 1896 I had already spoken of the simplicity of life 
necessary for the neuropath. “The true remedy for 
hysteria,” I said with Briquet, “is happiness.” That 
is perfectly true, but it is necessary to understand what 
happiness is suited to these weak individuals; I shall 
summarize it in a word; it is the easy life where all 
problems of business, of family, of love, of religion, are 
reduced to the minimum, in which the constantly re- 
newed daily struggles, preoccupation with the future, 
and intricate combinations are carefully excluded. No 
doubt fortune is a large element in such ease of exist- 
ence. I have seen hysterics cured by an inheritance, 
and that remedy is not within reach of all sufferers, 
but the choice of a career, of a favorable environment, 
the renunciation of too great ambitions, can also con- 
tribute to this entirely individual happiness.® 
One great principle in the treatment of neuropaths 
is that their lives should be extremely regular and 
monotonous. It is necessary to be constantly on guard 
against excited relatives who, on pretext of finding 
something better, continually demand changes for the 
sufferers. For any neuropath the best change is always 
a disaster and much delays the cure: it should be 
avoided as much as possible. It is often necessary to 
do away with or reduce religious exercises, studies, or 
professional work. At every stage it is always sim- 
plification, the reduction of the act and of the outlay. 
Even when the patient seems restored, when the crisis

peutique, 1896, XV, p. 10. Etat mental des hystériques, 2nd edition, 
1911, p. 677.
-P-A-G-E-186
    178 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
of depression seems cured, it is still through keeping 
him from ambition and adventures, through teaching 
him to restrict and safeguard his life that one best 
preserves him from relapses. 
Unhappily these restrictions are often painful: I 
have had occasion to show that, in many sufferers, 
exalted joy and enthusiasms are very dangerous and 
are followed by more or less severe depressive accidents. 
Such individuals have sometimes themselves recognized 
this danger: “I know very well,” said one of them, 
“that every exciting spectacle or circumstance is dan- 
gerous for me... . I guard myself against everything 
that might cause a lively joy or a profound grief... . 
I must give up the shows and the concerts that I like 
too well.... I need a gray state without emotion 
and I lead the life that I must... .” It will be said 
that it is impossible to avoid the occasions for grief, 
surprise and regret: this is not entirely correct. It is 
possible to avoid the circumstances that expose us 
to ruptures and deception; it is possible to avoid 
taking things too much to heart, and to make more 
rare the occasions that demand a triumph, a settle- 
ment, and also, less often, the occasions of traumatic 
memories. 
Many physicians, Grancher in particular, have in- 
structed tuberculous patients that they must resign 
themselves for years to a life different from that of 
others. We should make neuropaths understand that 
the same thing is true for them and that they avoid 
formidable bankruptcies by economizing each day, cent 
by cent, their psychic resources.

4, ECONOMY THROUGH ISOLATION 
Numerous ethical and therapeutic procedures have 
made use of more or less complete isolation and have 
sought to withdraw from his social environment the 
individual whom they wished to change or cure. Some 
real successes have been obtained in this way, but 
without the operators’ being conscious of their method 
of action and without their understanding the mech- 
anism of the therapeutic treatment that was used. 
The subjects, it was said, became sick because they 
found in their environment annoying cases of neuro- 
pathic troubles. The environment in which they lived 
was morally unwholesome, for many moral disorders 
are contagious as has been seen in the epidemics of 
chorea and manias of “possession” that were formerly 
so severe. The defenders of isolation treatments said 
further that the sufferers, by a change of environment, 
escaped exaggerated admiration or too indulgent pity, 
that a change of environment rendered much easier 
changes of conduct, that isolation became a kind of 
punishment and aroused healthful effort, that it facili- 
tated hygiene and the physical treatment of patients, 
ete... . All this is correct, and we might enumerate 
in addition many other advantages of the same sort, 
but, to my notion, this is not the essential point. 
All my studies on nervous diseases, and on the con- 
ditions of their development, have brought to light 
one fact that seems to me important. The acts that 
man must perform in society, in his relations with the 
persons who are in his immediate neighborhood, make
-P-A-G-E-188
    180 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
up the greater part of his life. It is in this social life 
that he is obliged to expend the greatest part of his 
strength, and, oftener than is believed, it is these every- 
day social relations with the members of his family, 
his neighbors, his friends, that are too costly for him 
and that bring about his psychological ruin. 
To make this fact clear I tried to study a particular 
case where one sees very well how much a social act 
costs. I examined not only the social conduct of the 
neuropath, but also the influence that this conduct 
has on the persons in his immediate neighborhood. 
Let us recall the essential traits of this behavior, which 
are the same in the majority of the neuroses and which 
are often quite manifest before the neuropathic con- 
dition has been diagnosed and recognized as patho- 
logical. The neuropath’s deliberative will is always 
diminished, if you do not let yourself be deceived by 
the visible effects of excitement and obstinacy. The 
subjects cannot accomplish any task that requires 
patience and effort; they do not know any more how 
to begin than how to finish: they are excited, obstinate 
and disturbed when it is a question of actually accom- 
plishing the acts that are so repellent to them. They 
are especially unable to accomplish correctly those two 
classes of acts that play such a large réle in social life, 
the acts of command and the acts of affection. They 
do not know how to face new situations, to make a 
decision, to take responsibilities, things that would be 
necessary in commands which were really useful; they 
are at bottom afraid of the struggle that they would 
have to consent to face to command a real obedience.
-P-A-G-E-189
  FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 181 
These subjects talk continually of their affections; they 
even have in many cases a craze for loving, but one 
must not be taken in by appearances: they are in 
reality quite incapable of truly being in love. 
In the place of these normal and difficult acts that 
they do not know how to perform, neuropaths perform 
other acts that are quite peculiar to them. They take 
many precautions in order to avoid acting, in order 
not to be drawn into the action that is costly for them; 
they restrain their desires; they avoid having partic- 
ular tastes; they cultivate, almost all of them, a kind 
of asceticism that is only one form of laziness; they 
love to hide and dissimulate their feelings. When they 
understand that, in spite of their efforts, other people’s 
action is going to affect them, they resist by refusing 
to take part in the other person’s action and they 
bend all their efforts to stopping and hindering the 
others from doing anything about them. In other 
cases, when they do not oppose another’s act, they 
wish to join in it, to take part in some way in order 
to curb it, to watch over it, and also in order to assure 
to themselves its good results at small cost. Hence 
the passion for helping, for collaboration, and, above 
all, the passion for authority. 
It is odd to see persons who are at bottom incapable 
of exercising a true and useful authority, present so 
often the passion for authority. This concerns indi- 
viduals who are perpetually giving orders to the people 
about them for a lot of acts for which the order is 
entirely useless. These acts have no importance; they 
could have been carried out differently without incon-
-P-A-G-E-190
    182 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
venience; most often, indeed, they would have been 
carried out in the same way if the people had been 
left free to act in their own fashion. But the dictators 
cannot tolerate having any acts whatever performed 
in their neighborhood unless they have ordered them. 
On one hand the verification of such perpetual obedi- 
ence reassures them, because they can thus alter the 
behavior of others and avoid the changes of environ- 
ment that they dread; on the other hand, it gives them 
a feeling of comfort when they can at every moment 
verify the fact that all these persons are at their dis- 
posal, and consequently are their inferiors. Some make 
their demands with violence and threat, others with a 
plaintive sweetness and in the name of the consider- 
ation owed them, but all seek to do completely away 
with the independence and initiative of the persons 
about them. 
This need for obedience, for care, for flattery can 
often be expressed in another way: its satisfaction is 
not demanded by orders, it is demanded as a mark of 
affection. It is then a question of the famous need for 
loving and being loved that plays such a considerable 
réle in the behavior of neuropaths. What they call 
“being loved” is, first, never to be attacked or injured 
in any way: “Isn’t it horrible to feel that you are in a 
rivalry, in a dispute with anyone?” With others, more 
numerous, the individual who loves them is an indi- 
vidual who renders them a host of services, who acts 
in their place in a host of painful situations and saves 
them much effort and weariness. In another group the 
services required of the lover are of a more delicate
-P-A-G-E-191
  FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 183 
order and the person who demands them does not 
count them as services; she is rather disposed to dis- 
guise them under the vague name of love. The one 
who loves becomes the one who comforts, who restores, 
who stimulates, and who does this sometimes by 
genital excitation but most often by means of those 
social actions that have the property of being stim- 
ulating, not for the one who performs them but for the 
one to whom they are addressed. The type of such 
actions is commendation, praise, flattery in all its 
forms. There is, however, something more in their 
idea of love; it is, first, the certainty that this person 
will fulfil his part always, that he will not change, that 
he will always be at their disposal to defend them, 
console them, and stimulate them, and, second, it is 
the certitude that these countless services will be ren- 
dered them indefinitely without their ever having to 
pay for them in any way. It is this last feature that 
explains a curious and common expression, that of the 
desire “to be loved for your own sake.” 
Unfortunately all these attempts at domination and 
at love do not succeed at all, and in particular they 
fail to cure the sufferer, or to take him out of his de- 
pression and too often he is forced to complicate them 
by adding to them new behavior that in its turn de- 
generates into folly. At the bottom of the teasing 
and sulking that are so common there is a need for 
verifying constantly the power that one has over peo- 
ple. The act of “making a scene” is a simulated com- 
bat just as teasing is a simulated attack and sulking 
is a simulated rupture. Jealousy plays a considerable
-P-A-G-E-192
    184 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
réle in these modes of behavior. It is made up of the 
monopolizing of an object or a person and of hostility 
toward other persons who might themselves be capable 
of seeking and possessing that loved object. In the 
inevitable rivalry a normal man forces himself to tri- 
umph by placing himself above his rival. But when 
an individual feels himself weak and has a terrible fear 
of effort he does not take the rivalry in that way; he 
wishes to triumph not by raising himself, but by low- 
ering his rival. Hence the manias of slander, of re- 
crimination, of spite, all the manias, impulsions, and 
deliriums of hate. 
All these types of neuropathic behavior cause a re- 
action in the participants, and this reaction is neces- 
sarily a complicated and difficult attitude. The neu- 
ropaths’ aboulia and indecision oblige us to take their 
‘places, to do their share of work to a greater extent 
than hitherto. Their incapacity for real love, the dif- 
ficulty they find in definitely accepting a grouping or 
an association ends by being painful and discouraging. 
The trouble and annoyance that they always have in 
their social relationships are contagious; they are em- 
barrassing on account of their timidity, for nothing is 
so difficult and tiresome as to talk with a timid person. 
No intimacy is possible with them; they pretend to 
desire it, but they behave, indeed, as if they dreaded it. 
They are constantly sad and discontented and “that 
gives the whole house a gray tone that is very dis- 
tressing.” 
Not only do they do nothing, but they make endless 
efforts to hinder our activity. In other cases they
-P-A-G-E-193
  FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 185 
consent to let us perform the act, but on the condition 
of their taking part and giving orders, advice, of their 
adding to the act useless details that allow them to 
believe that they are there for some purpose, and all 
this makes our activity more complicated. Their 
mania for superintending, for ordering, for criticizing, 
causes changes in the acts of the assistants; it changes 
all these acts into obedience; and this makes them 
more costly and robs them of their good effects. 
Their manias for love lead to new demands: in 
doing them any new service it is necessary to assure 
them skillfully concerning the future and to guarantee 
them that you will perform such service indefinitely 
throughout their life. It is necessary to guard against 
any careless manifestation of personal interest and 
make them understand that you expect nothing of 
them in return, that you “love them for themselves,” 
that they have in themselves the right to be loved 
indefinitely by the simple fact that they exist. Such 
a mania of rights subjects us, moreover, to a perpetual 
humiliation, for, if the sick person has the power to 
demand from us innumerable acts without having him- 
self to do anything for us, we are decidedly his infer- 
iors. Moreover, this is precisely the way in which he 
takes it, for he counts a great deal on noticing our 
inferiority at every moment, on verifying it and having 
it accepted. This behavior instinctively arouses in us 
a defence reaction; the perpetual demands of the pa- 
tient in the name of his rights, inevitably produce 
the thought that we also have rights that he never 
respects. This thought must be resisted to maintain
-P-A-G-E-194
  186 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
a high moral level of conduct, but psychologically this 
is very difficult. 
In spite of all precautions and all devotion we can- 
not avoid having the subject form sentiments of doubt 
and jealousy. The mental labor then becomes still 
greater when it is necessary to stand attacks and spite- 
fulness of every sort. These attacks are doubtless 
usually assumed and harmless; the behavior of the 
neuropath gives the impression of a continual lie and 
the behavior that it is necessary to adopt towards him 
is as complicated as the behavior toward an individual 
that one knows to be insincere. It requires great 
attention and great address. 
This difficult and complex behavior that the pres- 
ence of a neuropath calls forth in all the persons in 
his environment always has the same result: it is very 
fatiguing and, to take up our metaphor, it is enor- 
mously expensive. This is the continual cry of all 
those who approach such persons: “My grandmother 
is terribly fatiguing... . My wife is fatiguing; my 
household is sad and tiresome. My husband is awk- 
ward, dull, uncouth, anything you will, but above all 
he tires me out... .” To be fatiguing is to force us 
to make excessive expenditures of mental force that 
we should not make if these persons were not about us. 
The depression caused by the presence of these 
wearisome and expensive individuals shows itself even 
in physiological disorders. We can observe muscular 
weakness, respiratory and circulatory disorders in some 
subjects when they are in the presence of individuals 
who exhaust them. Digestion especially is often al-
-P-A-G-E-195
  FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 187 
tered in these morally unwholesome environments. But 
it is chiefly mental disorders that appear under such 
conditions. The simplest of these is the feeling of 
antipathy whose formation I have already tried to 
explain by the feeling of psychic exhaustion in the 
presence of certain persons. But it must not be for- 
gotten that the neuropath can be surrounded by per- 
sons whose weak psychic tension is easily lowered. 
These persons quickly suffer from the complicated and 
expensive conduct that is imposed on them and they 
soon exhibit disorders of psychic depression. 
Neuroses and psychoses are not, of course, properly 
speaking, contagious like infectious diseases; doubtless, 
imitation and suggestion proper do not play more than 
a feeble part in the transmission of neuroses. But, 
nevertheless, there is a fact which we should not dis- 
regard, namely, that we very often meet a large num- 
ber of neuropaths united in the same family or in the 
same environment. One cannot always explain their 
reunion by the influence of heredity; I have analyzed 
in detail, thirty-two very typical records ® of neuroses 
in husband and wife or in a lover and mistress who 
have lived several years together. In all these cases, 
one of the couple, normal before the union, became ill 
after a few years of living together with an individual 
who had been for a long time affected with psychas- 
thenic disorder. It is a question, to my notion, of an 
indirect influence of the sick person who makes social 
life more difficult and costly by his presence, and it is 
this increase of expenditure that causes a psychic de- 
* Les médications psychologiques, 1920, II, p. 180.
-P-A-G-E-196
188 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
pression in the other. Whether or not we use the 
word “contagion” for these cases, I wish to insist on 
only one thing. This is that living with certain persons 
is a condition that frequently determines and encour- 
ages neuroses. 
I have taken this example of the grievous influence 
that a neuropath has on the psychic health of his 
acquaintance first, because individuals of this kind 
are very numerous, but also because this case is very 
enlightening. It gives us a clear comprehension of 
what constitutes a complicated, tiring, morally un- 
wholesome social environment. I have been led to 
describe many other groups made up in too compli- 
cated a fashion or presenting some irregularity that 
makes the organization of the group too difficult. The 
pathology of groups and its relation to the pathology 
of individuals must be some day investigated. Here 
we are content with one point only, that social conduct 
often becomes complicated in a group and becomes 
ruinous for those of the members who have not suffi- 
cient resources. : 
It is this notion that explains the good effects of 
isolation. Many individuals have understood it in- 
stinctively and the change of social environment has 
been their preservation, or has cured them of a serious 
disorder. “My stomach and my head are restored,” 
they say, “if I leave the house for some time.” The 
phobias of neuropaths may be signs of necessary pre- 
cautions: timidity and social phobias sometimes indi- 
cate the exhaustion that is caused certain persons by 
society, and particularly a certain society, and it is not
-P-A-G-E-197
  
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 189 
a bad thing to recognize them. The isolation treat- 
ment attempts to answer these indications; it offers 
itself as a form of the rest cure, as a means of obtaining 
psychic repose that is more effective than a stay in 
bed. It is useful to have a good understanding of this 
principle of isolation treatments in order to apply them 
in a practical and efficient way. 
5. ECONOMIES EFFECTED THROUGH LIQUIDATION 
We again find this same principle of psychic econ- 
omy in other psychotherapeutic methods that are quite 
different in appearance. The decrease in psychic ex- 
penditures further explains the good results of treat- 
ments which I have already described as “The search 
for traumatic memories” and which gave birth to all 
the methods of psychoanalysis. These treatments 
may be summed up under the name of treatments by 
psychic liquidation and their principle is easily under- 
stood. 
The harmful action of these traumatic memories 
must first be appreciated in order to account for the 
service rendered to patients by suppressing or modify- 
ing them. An exciting event is an event to which the 
poorly prepared individual does not know how to adapt 
himself completely or in such a way as to suppress 
the trouble and disequilibrium that this event brings 
into his life. For lack of precise reaction, well organ- 
ized in advance, he is obliged to fall back on old ele- 
mentary tendencies that previously functioned alone 
before the organization of superior tendencies. Con- 
nected with this unexpected event there is a rapid
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
awakening of the lower tendencies, fear, anger, the 
vital instinct. These elementary tendencies are char- 
acterized not only by their low psychic level, but also 
by the great quantity of forces that they mobilize. 
From the beginning of a reaction that miscarries, there 
is, as in the reflex from a false step, a great expendi- 
ture of forces in order to be prepared for every con- 
tingency and this setting at liberty of forces which were 
up to this time in the form of capital plays a consid- 
erable réle in emotion. 
These important forces, poorly applied, come from 
all sides and cause varied excitement even in the ele- 
mentary visceral functions. It is like a flood of force 
that disturbs even respiration and circulation. Vas- 
cular changes are not, as Lange and W. James said, 
the essential of, and point of departure for, the emo- 
tion. They simply play a part in man’s consciousness 
of the emotion, but they are consequences of the emo- 
tion itself. In the simplest cases these emotional trou- 
bles end very soon when the unexpected circumstance 
which caused the disorder of the reactions has disap- 
peared. They often leave in their train an exhaustion 
connected with the excessive expenditure of forces, an 
exhaustion which may sometimes be sufficiently serious 
to cause some symptoms of depression but which tends 
to repair itself after the provoking cause of all these 
excessive expenditures no longer exists. 
Unfortunately in many cases the situation is more 
complicated. The provoking circumstance does not 
disappear completely or rather the disorganized and 
insufficient reaction did not cause it to disappear, and
-P-A-G-E-199
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 191 
it has left the problem unsolved. To rid himself of 
the discomfort caused by this unsuccessful adaptation, 
man is obliged to perform new actions. A defeat puts 
us in a particular situation that demands a new adapta- 
tion. We have then to choose between three different 
modes of conduct: either purely and simply to begin 
the act over again, or to repair it by altering its force, 
its duration, or even its combination of movements, or, 
lastly, to give up the act, renouncing the satisfaction 
that it could have supplied. This last resolution is 
extremely important. It is resignation accompanied 
with the feeling of necessity, of impossibility. This is 
a new act very high in the hierarchy, which I have in 
my lectures on the related tendencies connected with 
work and accomplishment. When an individual is 
somewhat weak constitutionally or when he is some- 
what depressed by previous exhaustion, he becomes 
incapable of this difficult act. One of the most curious 
observations that I have made on the characteristics 
of depressed patients concerns their inability to appre- 
ciate the impossible and their inability to be resigned. 
These same persons have likewise great difficulty in 
falling back on the second mode of conduct which 
would consist in a modification of their action, because 
this would demand invention and initiative, which is 
equally difficult. Many of these individuals are al- 
most always led to adopt the first and simplest be- 
havior, which is the oldest and requires the least ten- 
sion, and they begin the act over again just as they 
have already performed it. 
This is one of the commonest modes of behavior in 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  192 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
any mental weakness, even slight. It gives rise to the 
phenomenon that I have named after the phrase of 
one of my patients, the symptom of “getting stuck.” 
It plays a considerable réle in a number of manias, 
obsessions and impulsions. This behavior is partic- 
ularly frequent among persons who have a low psychic 
tension. Such patients do not easily reach the end 
of an act, the conclusion that is characterized by a spe- 
cial behavior, the behavior of victory. This arrest of 
the act by triumph, in contrast to the arrest of the act 
by fatigue, is most noticeable in the joy that crowns 
a successful act, but it occurs likewise at the end of 
acts that have failed, and it constitutes the satisfac- 
tion that comes from a settlement that makes resigna- 
tion easy. The persons of whom I speak do not know 
how to finish or to triumph, but they make unceasing 
efforts to obtain the joy of this finish. They are also 
disposed to repeat endlessly the same insufficient and 
incomplete act, and one may say that many of them 
spend their lives in indefinitely pushing against a wall. 
This endless repetition of the exciting action, al- 
ready costly in itself, increases the expenditure in enor- 
mous proportions and causes a greater and greater 
exhaustion. Under the influence of this exhaustion the 
act that was already insufficient and maladroit from 
the start becomes unsuitable and even abnormal. It 
becomes degraded and takes on a lower form in the 
hierarchy of acts. It loses the characteristics that 
belong to the level of reflective activity; it is no longer 
coérdinated with other acts; it no longer has a part 
in that story of our life that we are constantly formu-
-P-A-G-E-201
  FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 193 
lating in memory; it is no longer correctly assimilated 
to our personality. In short, it gradually takes the 
strange aspect of an automatic act inspired by some 
occult power, of an unreal act performed in a dream, 
or of a sub-conscious act. One observes all the inter- 
mediary stages between the simply excited act that is 
consciously repeated in “getting stuck” and the really 
sub-conscious act that continues indefinitely, unknown 
to consciousness and memory. 
The individual, then, who maintains a fixed idea of 
an event does not exactly have a memory in connec- 
tion with that event and it is for clearness of speech 
that we have spoken of this as traumatic memory. 
The subject is often incapable of uttering the words 
in respect to the event that we call a memory, but he 
is confronted by a difficult situation from which he 
has not known how to withdraw honorably, to which 
he has not known how to adapt himself entirely, and 
he continues to make efforts so to do. The repetition 
of this situation, these continual efforts, cause a fa- 
tigue, an exhaustion that plays a considerable réle in 
neuroses. An example borrowed from normal or al- 
most normal life will explain the mechanism of this 
exhaustion. I have just received a disagreeable letter 
which demands an answer that is quite difficult and 
painful to write. I think about writing this answer 
and I compose it almost completely in my imagination, 
but I have not the courage to write it down immedi- 
ately and I leave the letter that I have received on 
my desk. Henceforth it is impossible for me to seat 
myself at this table, to pass before it, even to enter
-P-A-G-E-202
  194 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
the room without seeing the letter, without being con- 
scious of its presence and without recommencing a 
hundred times the effort to formulate the answer. At 
the beginning this answer would have been written in 
ten minutes. If I add up all the minutes for com- 
posing it in imagination, all the unfruitful attempts, 
and all the resulting emotions, I have spent hours of 
painful work in not writing this answer, and it will 
not be surprising if after several days I declare myself 
to be tired out by this wretched letter that I have not 
written. In reality the illness caused by the traumatic 
reminiscence is not a new thing for us; it is a phe- 
nomenon quite analogous to the exhaustion we have 
observed in these individuals who are placed in a situ- 
ation too complex or too difficult for them, in which 
they struggle indefinitely. 
The evolution of these patients’ lives seems arrested, 
they are “stuck” by an obstacle they cannot surmount. 
The event that we call traumatic has created a situ- 
ation to which it is necessary to re-act, that is to say, 
to which one must adapt oneself by changes in the 
exterior world and in oneself. Now the thing that 
characterizes all these “stuck” patients is that they 
have not liquidated the difficult situation. This one 
does not behave like a young girl who has lost her 
mother, that one does not behave like a young girl 
who remains alone at home with her parents after her 
sister’s marriage, another one does not behave like one 
who has escaped a danger in the street and has fortu- 
nately reéntered the house, still another does not be- 
have like a woman who has refused one match and
-P-A-G-E-203
  
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 195 
has married another man. Without exception this lack 
of adaptation is the characteristic of all these patients 
and it is this, as well as psychic exhaustion, that causes 
most disorders. 
Under such conditions it is not difficult to under- 
stand the action of these treatments derived from ani- 
mal magnetism whose principal characteristic is the 
finding, the bringing to light and the modification of 
these traumatic memories. These treatments con- 
sisted, as has been seen, in systematic interrogation 
of the subject under special conditions in order to cause 
the reappearance, in as clear a form as possible, of the 
memories related to these exciting events, by means 
of exercises imposed on the subject in order to make 
him regain consciousness of these memories and a 
belief in their reality. 
In other cases, I have tried to put into practice a 
very simple idea that occurs to the mind immediately 
when this type of disease is considered. They would 
be immediately cured, could they forget the event. 
“Knowing when to forget,” said Taine, “is a great sci- 
ence, for peoples and for individuals.” It is a science 
that neuropaths scarcely possess at all, or that they 
at least do not know how to apply properly, and the 
discovery of something that would permit us to cause 
forgetfulness at will would be a precious discovery for 
psychiatry. The interest of this study is the excuse 
for the various experiments that I have made in sup- 
pressing memories by suggestion, in destroying them 
by the dissociation of the images or words that con- 
stituted them. These methods have proved interest- 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  196 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
ing in the treatment of a curious fixed idea that lasted 
for twenty years, a fixed idea of cholera, in the dis- 
sociation of certain dreams that brought on inconti- 
nence of urine, in the cure of several erotic obsessions. 
A detailed account of these treatments is to be found 
in various studies. The best methods are those that 
cause the assimilation of the exciting emotion, that 
bring the subject to comprehend it by reflection, to 
react against it correctly and to resign himself to it. 
We shall have to return to this question in the follow- 
ing chapter in connection with certain stimulating 
activities. 
It is these methods that have been taken over, some- 
times developed in an interesting manner, just as often 
exaggerated, by the school of Psychoanalysis. This 
school has made a mistake, in my opinion, in consider- 
ing these traumatic memories as being always of a 
sexual nature. This is correct in certain cases, but 
one should not, because one has taken a stand, assert 
it of all other cases, thus committing oneself to indeli- 
cate investigations and sometimes to dangerous sug- 
gestions. But it is nevertheless only just to recognize 
the part that this school has taken in the development 
of these still little known therapeutic methods. 
Why has this liquidation of a long past event so 
great an importance? Because it puts the mind at 
rest. After this liquidation, sometimes, to be sure, 
painful and costly, the mind stops making the efforts 
at adaptation that were being indefinitely repeated. 
It demobilizes considerable forces. It is not always 
advisable to have at one’s disposition a considerable
-P-A-G-E-205
  FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 197 
amount of unused forces. Similarly, those who have 
great sums of money that they do not know how to 
use run the risk of random spending and they are not 
always able to put them back into reserve. In certain 
cases the reduction of the expendable forces, or weak- 
ness itself, may be highly useful. The mind will make 
economies when it has less work to do in directing, 
draining, and putting into reserve a reduced amount 
of forces. These observations indicate the connection 
between treatments by liquidation and treatments by 
discharge which are of the same nature.” 
In a word, certain patients are brought to ruin be- 
cause they constantly have a certain supplementary 
expense in addition to their ordinary mode of life. 
Psychological treatment has no other aim than to do 
away with this useless expense. Since the patient is 
not able to do it alone, it is necessary to help him to 
liquidate this old affair which is ruining him, and the 
remaining revenues will be enough for the expenses 
of his current life. Most of the methods of psycho- 
logical treatment are thus methods of economy which 
in one way or another attempt to conserve and increase 
the psychic forces of the patient. 
6. ECONOMIES EFFECTED BY GUIDANCE AND BY VARIOUS 
THERAPIES 
More often than might be thought, the same mech- 
anism enters into many psychological treatments. If 
the exhortations of Christian Science rid us, as Mark 
Twain said, of the fear of colds in the head and of 
™ Les médications psychologiques, II, p. 292. 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  198 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
indigestion, they bring a great relief to the mind and 
cause many forces to be available for more important 
acts. 
Treatments by suggestion avoid for the patient the 
choice of the act to be performed and the labor of 
reflective resolution, operations that are very costly. 
The subjects themselves are aware of this. They know 
very well that they are incapable of performing certain 
acts voluntarily or else that they will retard their 
execution by a mass of scruples, of useless efforts, of 
fixed ideas and they themselves desire to be made to 
execute certain acts in a forced or automatic way. 
“Have you absolutely decided to feed me with the 
tube if I do not eat?” “Exactly.” “In that case I am 
forced and it is you who take the responsibility; I pre- 
fer that.” And she eats as she should. “As soon 
as I try to eat by myself,” said another patient to me, 
“T feel as if a voice said to me, ‘Do not eat.’ As soon 
as this voice begins I choke, and I would have to make 
enormous efforts to stop it. What I prefer is to eat 
without thinking about it or reflecting.” 
It is especially under the influence of moral guid- 
ance that one observes the good effects of economy of 
forces. It is not necessary to study only medical guid- 
ance proper to find evidence of this influence. Many 
of these subjects have accidentally experienced certain 
periods in their lives in which they have submitted 
to more or less rigorous guidance, and it is easy to 
verify the fact that these periods have been those in 
which they have felt best physically and morally. One 
detail struck me when I looked into the pathological 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 199 
history of men afflicted with psychasthenic troubles. 
This was that many among them after having exhib- 
ited considerable disorders in their first youth before 
twenty, displayed a very distinct recovery, an appar- 
ent cure about the age of twenty-one during the years 
of military service. A man of thirty-five who has 
actually suffered for several years from a bizarre 
phobia “the phobia of his wife’s eyes” who had pre- 
viously at the age of sixteen had an agoraphobia, then 
a phobia of isolation, the mania of prediction, etc., 
says himself that he has never been really tranquil 
except in the regiment at the age of twenty-one. “Dis- 
cipline doubtless agreed with me, for I lived serenely 
in the barracks without being anxious about anything 
and I earned nothing but compliments. The improve- 
ment even lasted for some time after my release and I 
thought that I was freed from my folly, but soon in 
my free life everything began again.” One might re- 
peat word for word the same remarks in connection 
with fourteen records that show us in like manner the 
favorable effects of discipline. 
One of these psychasthenic young men on leaving 
the barracks found refuge in a seminary and seems 
to continue to feel very well. It is likely that if we 
could have some information on the psychic life of 
convents we should see that many formerly serious 
neuropaths have found in them a refuge and a rela- 
tive cure. 
From time to time, unfortunately too infrequently, 
there occur in society certain kinds of association be- 
tween a sick person and a sane, energetic individual
-P-A-G-E-208
    200 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
who takes the lead and keeps his associate in order. 
This is what ordinarily happens to young children in 
many families. Very often the appearance of the neu- 
rosis is delayed by the healthy influence of one of 
the parents. It is for this reason that we so often 
observe disorders appearing after their death. 
The same event very often occurs in marriage. It 
is true that union with one of these neuropaths is often 
disastrous. The healthy individual becomes disgusted 
and leaves, or else becomes exhausted and contami- 
nated in his turn, as we have already observed in a 
preceding chapter, without the invalid profiting 
greatly from his partner’s suffering. But we must 
note, however, that in certain cases, by reason of par- 
ticular circumstances, this does not occur. During sev- 
eral years at least the healthy individual seems to have 
sufficient energy to impose a discipline, and usually, 
without being aware of it, he cures the other’s disorder. 
In our observations, of course, affairs end badly, since 
the patient is brought to us, either because the director 
has disappeared, because he has tired of his work, or 
because he has lost his influence. But it should not be 
forgotten that these very patients have previously 
found peace and happiness for many years, and that 
there must be many cases unknown to the physician 
because equilibrium has been sufficiently maintained 
during a whole lifetime. 
In some records I have noted that a priest to whom 
these patients frequently went to confess was for sev- 
eral years able to direct successfully certain patients 
who were difficult to handle. This must be of common
-P-A-G-E-209
  
FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 201 
occurrence; for there must be many psychasthenics in 
the confessionals. The work of M. Abbé Eymieu 
shows that he acquired in his ministry a certain 
amount of experience with these patients. Nuns, 
school teachers, nurses, masseurs, frequently have oc- 
casion to play this réle and in a dozen records we see 
that such persons can carry out this supervision very 
well for years. Parents, as has happened in most of 
these cases, are often disquieted by this situation, 
which seems to them abnormal and they fear lest a 
young girl completely dominated may leave all her 
fortune in her teacher’s hands. This fear is certainly 
well founded; it is one of the dangers of this accidental 
direction and we shall have to return to it in a short 
time. But it is no less true, taking an exclusively med- 
ical point of view, that these forms of direction are 
beneficial and that their interruption may bring about 
serious difficulty. 
The strangest case is that in which an association 
exists between two patients who seem to play to the 
life, the fable of the blind man and the paralytic. I 
have collected three records of this type, the most 
interesting one, that of Ai., a woman of forty-three, 
has already been published. This woman, afflicted 
with aboulia, with doubt, and with a contact phobia, 
could no longer touch any toilet article and was living 
in a filthy manner. Towards the age of thirty she 
encountered a former schoolmate, also depressed and 
suffering from aboulia but tormented by an obsession 
of death and suicide. Each confided her miseries to the 
other and each derided the other. After these con-
-P-A-G-E-210
  202 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
fidences they were both astonishingly improved and 
tranquil for several days. The result was that for ten 
years they lived together in a much more proper way 
because they mutually sustained each other. 
Under the influence of medical care we observe the 
same changes, and, as will be seen in the next chapter, 
the same feeling of need for direction. Often in medical 
direction there is only a more reasoned and frequently 
more prudent application of those same influences that 
have often had a good effect in the course of the 
patient’s life. : 
It is evident that there is a question here of suffi- 
ciently complex psychic phenomena into which enter 
numerous factors. Attention has often been drawn to 
the fact that it is right to attribute a certain part to 
suggestion or to analogous phenomena. It is not to be 
denied that this or that phenomenon of affinity pre- 
sented by certain somnambulists may be related to 
the more or less involuntary and unfortunate sugges- 
tions of the physician, or to the ideas conceived by the 
subject and transformed into suggestions by reason of 
the special state during which they are developed. 
There is thus a close relationship between the two phe- 
nomena of direction and of suggestion, but it must not 
be concluded from this that they are identical. The 
phenomena of influence that are observable in the 
course of direction are much more extensive than those 
of suggestion or even of suggestibility. They exist in 
patients, in particular in psychasthenics, who are not 
at all suggestible. In the influence of direction there 
are many characteristics that go beyond suggestion
-P-A-G-E-211
  FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 203 
proper. In short, in this case as in all the others, sug- 
gestion is not self-explanatory. If it is possible, at 
least in certain cases, to make one of these phenomena 
depend on the other, I should say that it is much 
rather suggestion that varies with influence and 
depends on it. 
I am no more disposed to accept in its entirety the 
theory presented by M. Freud, who relates the phe- 
nomenon of influence to the normal manifestations of 
human affections and especially to those of sexual love. 
I should rather be disposed to say here as before that 
the phenomena of influence are more general than sen- 
timents of love properly so-called, and that far from 
depending on them, influence contains them as one of 
its varieties. 
In this need of direction, we see rather a natural 
desire and a foreshadowing of those treatments through 
repose and by the simplification of life whose impor- 
tance we have already noted. The sick person is a 
fatigued, exhausted individual who has the most urgent 
need for rest and for saving his strength. But he 
does not know how to rest and permits himself to be 
forced into doing continually what tires him the most. 
His obsessive ideas that are “like gimlets in his head,” 
his repetitions, the resolutions he imposes on himself, 
his doubts, his questionings, his desperate as well as 
futile efforts, nourish and continually increase his ex- 
haustion. He has “stuck” on some little problem that 
life has raised, he remains indefinitely confronting the 
same act, which he not only does not succeed in per- 
forming, but which he exhausts himself in trying to
-P-A-G-E-212
    204 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
perform; he pushes endlessly against a wall. The real 
life into which he has plunged presents complex situ- 
ations or situations he believes complex; he wishes to 
collect all the information, to discuss different motives 
for action; he becomes mixed, he hesitates, he arrives 
neither at a conclusion, nor at a desire, and begins 
the same deliberation over and over again without 
being able to do the act or to give up doing it. “I 
cannot step over the sill of this house nor can I go 
away from it.” When life is simple such persons them- 
selves complicate it by their impulses to dominate, 
to tease, to disparage, to a crazy quest after love, to 
dangerous adventures that disturb their social environ- 
ment. These constant attempts and efforts of all sorts 
cause a perpetual expenditure of forces when so little 
is left to them. 
Courses of treatment, whatever their nature, whether 
they involve hypnotism, suggestion, dissociation of 
ideas, simplification of living, or education, tremen- 
dously reduce all these efforts and expenditures. Ob- 
sessions, manias, tics are arrested, actions are simpli- 
fied, resolutions are made, situations are liquidated, 
endless deliberations are terminated by a simple solu- 
tion. The work has been done by another, no doubt, 
but it has been done and the efforts have been stopped. 
The patient has learned to perform practical acts which 
save him from getting “stuck,” from phobias and from 
anxieties; he attains an economy of action, he discovers 
the art of resting. Moreover, the chief expenditures 
for the near future are economized by rules that mi- 
nutely regulate the employment of his time and avoid
-P-A-G-E-213
  FORMS OF MENTAL ECONOMY 205 
the labor of decisions that must be made every minute: 
the economy in all this is obvious. 
The officer in the regiment, the superior in the con- 
vent, the head of the family play the same réle: they 
regulate life and cut short problems that demand re- 
flection and effort. The patient is rid of all the higher 
operations that demand great expenditure. In spite 
of his small psychic income, he can live at his ease. 
We shall see in connection with stimulation, another 
activity that also plays a réle in direction, but one of 
the essential principles of this direction and one of the 
causes of its beneficial influence is the economy of 
forces that it causes. 
It is likewise probable that many treatments that 
seem purely physical have an influence of the same 
nature on morale. The forces that play a réle in the ex- 
ternal behavior of man and that are considered in this 
connection as psychic forces are at bottom the same 
that serve for the maintenance of life and the function- 
ing of the organs. Exhaustion caused by organic dis- 
eases, by the struggle against intoxication or infection, 
by the repair of the organs, has its effect on psycho- 
logical conduct. Conversely, at least in certain cases, 
the economies that are made in certain physiological 
expenditures permit the renewal of psychic activity. 
Doubtless the difference between the two activities 
is such that this relationship is not always easy to 
observe. Too often the reéstablishment of visceral 
health is not enough to improve mental activity. But 
too numerous exceptions ought not to prevent one from 
conceding the beneficial influences.
-P-A-G-E-214
  206 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
The treatment of every kind of local disease, of 
every kind of superimposed intoxication, has often con- 
tributed to the restoration of mental force. From this 
point of view the most interesting treatments are those 
that relieve spasms, that calm griefs, that take away 
fears. This is noticeable in many cases and in par- 
ticular in the treatment of diseases of the sexual or- 
gans, in the treatment of various gastric diseases and 
in various intestinal disorders which occur so often 
in neuropathic exhaustion from pains in all parts of 
the body, from the anxieties that these cause in con- 
nection with all the organs. 
We see this fundamental psychological principle of 
economy entering into everything. Psychic behavior 
is not the work of pure mind, it is an activity of the 
whole organism that demands doubtless a consider- 
able expenditure of force. This expenditure is all the 
greater when the acts are on the highest level. Most 
disorders of behavior result from a lack of these forces. 
If I may be permitted such a comparison, all these 
diseases are nothing more at bottom than various ways 
of going bankrupt and falling into misery. In spite of 
apparent differences a great number of psychological 
therapies have a general likeness. Nothing is more 
urgent when one is confronted by an individual on 
his way to bankruptcy than to reduce his expenses and 
to establish a strict economy.
-P-A-G-E-215
CHAPTER IV 
PSYCHIC INCOME 
The establishment of a budget includes not only the 
recording of outlay; it assumes in addition the study 
of resources and profit. We know very little of the 
forces that man expends and of their origin. At the 
most we know that a certain amount of force is each 
day put at our command like a regular income, and 
that we cannot exceed this. We know also that this 
revenue is not the same for all individuals and that 
here also we have the hereditary rich and the heredi- 
tary poor. But psychological medicine need not be 
too much preoccupied with these general problems; it 
is primarily interested in those whose revenue is inade- 
quate and it seeks to balance their budget. It attains 
this first by advising economy; it can also seek whether 
it would not be possible to increase the revenue by 
added profits. This is the problem of psychic income 
that is at the bottom of many psychotherapeutic meth- 
ods, and that is, unfortunately, just beginning to be 
squarely faced. This problem seems to me to present 
three different aspects according as it is a ques- 
tion of the acquiring of tendencies, of increasing the 
quantity of psychic forces, or of the raising of their 
tension. 
207  
-P-A-G-E-216
  208 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
1. THE ACQUISITION OF NEW TENDENCIES 
Life does not consist only in the exercise of ten- 
dencies that exist in the latent state in a living being; 
it consists also in the acquisition and the fixation of 
new tendencies. Every living being placed in a new 
environment adapts itself, first, by creating new com- 
binations of movements that respond appropriately to 
the new ways in which the environment affects it, and 
then, by fixing these combinations of movements and 
building up corresponding tendencies, that is, disposi- 
tions to produce such a reaction correctly, rapidly, and 
easily in an automatic fashion. When the individual 
is alone in the presence of these new circumstances, 
it acquires such new tendencies by the process of trial 
and error, and fixes them by long repetition. At the 
beginning it is driven by a protective excitement to 
make a host of movements this way and that; little 
by little it discards those movements that do not ‘suc- 
ceed and saves only those that succeed. The experi- 
ments of psychologists on the behavior of animals that 
are given a problem to solve clearly demonstrate the 
existence of this mechanism. This simple and prim- 
itive manner of acquisition is inconvenient in that it is 
very slow and demands a great expenditure of strength 
and the maintenance of a high tension during a long 
period of effort. 
If another individual has already acquired a new 
tendency, he can by his mere presence and example 
make much easier the acquisition of the appropriate 
movements in the one that does not yet possess them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
  
PSYCHIC INCOME 209 
If the competent individual is a man capable of observ- 
ing and of understanding he will teach the animal 
much more quickly, for he will know how to find 
training methods that will shorten the task. 
If, indeed, the pupil himself is a man able by means 
of his previous tendencies to react to language and to 
obey speech, the recall of old movements, the cessa- 
tion of useless movements, and the encouragement of 
fortunate movements will be enormously facilitated 
and education may be still more rapid. Numerous 
studies summarized in particular in the book of Mr. 
Woodworth, 1903, have shown that by means of edu- 
cational processes of that sort, a normal man could 
make enormous changes even in his most elementary 
acts, that he could gain control over his reflexes, change 
the functions of micturition, of defecation, of respira- 
tion, and even that of circulation. In the lectures that 
I gave in Boston in 1906 on psychotherapy I recalled 
in that connection the curious experiments of M. Blair 
on the voluntary movement of the ears. Normally 
a man does not move his ears; with a proper training, 
however, by associating the movement sought with 
voluntary movements of his forehead he can master it. 
It is still more true that an intelligent education can 
transform the movements of members that are already 
entirely at our disposal. We know that men are capable 
of learning innumerable acts and that they raise them- 
selves by education and instruction to the highest men- 
tal operations. These operations are very difficult at 
the start and demand great conscious effort, but 
through repetition they become, thanks to the mech-
-P-A-G-E-218
  210 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
anism of habit, more and more easy and rapid, so much 
so that they finish by being executed correctly without 
attention and almost without consciousness. Thus 
education consists in the production and repetition of 
a new action when it takes place before a competent 
witness who looks on, corrects it and causes it to be 
repeated until the act shall have become not only 
correct but even automatic. 
It is no less true that this acquisition of new ten- 
dencies offers considerable difficulty, especially when 
one wishes to make use of this method of education 
to transform the behavior of neuropaths. It can be 
easily shown that, left alone, in his own keeping, the 
patient does not end by training himself. He remains 
just as maladroit in the same circumstances. He does 
not acquire tendencies that would respond correctly 
and automatically. Moreover, he does not even suc- 
ceed in relearning when he has lost a tendency that 
he formerly possessed in a more or less complete 
fashion. Why does this remain the case? The patient 
does not take exact account of the nature of his trou- 
bles and of the nature of the act that is wanting. Even 
if he succeeds in noting this defect in himself, he does 
not know how to go about remedying it. He does not 
know the mechanism of the act that he seeks to ac- 
quire. He does not know how to decompose it into 
its elements, or to repeat the useful movements singly, 
or to perform the act with the tension that fixes the 
tendency. He is reduced to the method of learning by 
incoérdinated agitation which can reach a result only 
after an enormous time, a considerable expenditure of
-P-A-G-E-219
  PSYCHIC INCOME 211 
force, and great efforts of attention in order to recog- 
nize and hold the slightest useful gains as they appear, 
and to conserve them. 
Such education is possible only with the aid of a 
teacher who points out exactly the act that should be 
acquired and lessens the necessary expense by directing 
the apprenticeship. But can the teacher, who is here 
the physician, recognize exactly the act that is lacking 
to the neuropath, and is he able to teach the subject 
to perform the corresponding act? We are only begin- 
ning to suspect that neuropathic disorders are the indi- 
rect result of inadequacies in action, and that the emo- 
tion is only a derived excitement in the place of an 
inadequate act of adaptation. In most cases it is very 
hard to point out with any precision the act that is 
wanting, and, as for the analysis of that act, we know 
that it is rudimentary. Education is successful when 
it concerns artificial acts that men themselves have 
invented and with whose mechanism they are quite 
familiar. A ballet-master, who has invented a new 
dance by joining elements borrowed from old dances, 
will teach it easily. What we teach normal children 
is almost solely things of this sort, sciences and arts 
constructed by men, and which men well understand. 
It is dangerous to connect, as is often done, the educa- 
tion of neuropathic patients with such education of 
children in the schools, for the instruction has not at 
all the same object. It concerns teaching the patient 
not the arts consciously invented by men, but natural 
actions, built up unconsciously by living beings ages 
ago out of elements of which we are ignorant and com-
-P-A-G-E-220
  212 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
binations that we do not understand. We cannot 
pretend to teach them as we teach dancing or mathe- 
matics. We teach well only what we know very well, 
and since we have very little knowledge of the psy- 
chology of behavior, we shall teach it very badly. 
The subjects will naturally have to make up for this 
defective teaching by a greater psychic tension and a 
greater expenditure of force. 
Such education has, up to the present, been prac- 
tical only in reéstablishing certain elementary func- 
‘tions in subjects whose general activity was not much 
disturbed. It has been possible to train movements, 
to relearn walking, eating, breathing, to suppress cer- 
tain tics by training in immobility, even to reéducate 
certain sensory functions. But when we now wish to 
go beyond these tics and cramps, when we find ourselves 
confronted with agoraphobias, with phobias of all 
sorts, with genital perversions, with obsessions, with 
delirium, are we going to pretend that we know exactly 
the tendency that is disordered and that we have to 
reéducate? Can it be seriously maintained that it is 
the function of speech that is disordered in the timid 
person, or that of walking that is altered in the agora- 
phobic? And when it is a matter of delirium, is it 
enough to say that there is alteration of attention? 
But present-day psychologists are not very sure 
whether attention is a special function, whether there 
exists one operation that corresponds to the totality 
of facts roughly classified under the name of attention. 
There are even some who would drop this word “atten- 
tion” from the psychological vocabulary. Are the
-P-A-G-E-221
  
PSYCHIC INCOME 213 
physicians going to be able to reéducate this attention 
about which we know so little? Therapeutic failures 
ought not to surprise us. 
It is true, nevertheless, that these reflections are not 
entirely discouraging; they show us that the failures 
of education do not come from the weakness of the 
method but from the ignorance of the operator. A 
well-founded knowledge of the physiology of walking 
permits an improved reéducation of tabetics; advances 
in psychological science that make us better acquainted 
with the tendencies implied in various forms of con- 
duct, and their mechanism will in time render the edu- 
cation of neuropaths more easy and more effective. 
The research that has been done on the nature of 
education leads us, unfortunately, to forsee another 
difficulty much more serious. Admitting that we are 
well aware of what we wish to make the patient learn, 
let us ask ourselves if he is going to be able to obey 
us and to understand. Learning a new thing implies 
an excess of forces able to create new combinations of 
movements, to spend themselves in trials, capable of 
choosing and establishing the act chosen. A treat- 
ment of this kind demands serious effort and can im- 
pose on the patient an excessive fatigue. The exer- 
cises that are enjoined on him are not as simple and 
as natural as they seem. It is not true that a normal 
man always possesses a tendency to keep up for a long 
time a voluntary immobility, or a tendency to execute 
movements slowly while watching them constantly: 
we do not move in that fashion at all. Thus it is not 
astonishing that in these treatments we observe sub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  - 
214 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
stitutions of one tic for another, a delirious symptom 
for a digestive disorder, for excitement and exhaustion. 
In short, it is not only a question of the quantity 
of forces to expend, it is a question of the adaptation 
of forces to the proposed problem, and of the tension 
that it is necessary to give these forces. One of the 
important properties of the lowering of psychic tension 
characteristic of our patients is the diminution and 
the suppression of that power of acquisition, the stop- 
ping of adaptations and the acquisition of new knowl- 
edge. This fact is much in evidence in the continuous 
amnesia of such patients, and in their inability to adapt 
themselves to new situations. “I can no more learn 
a new bit of verse than I can get used to my apart- 
ments or my wife.” When they try to become ac- 
climated, to become adapted to such changes of situ- 
ation, they show inadequacy, fatigue, anxiety, or obses- 
sions of sacrilege. And you would ask of them pre- 
cisely an adaptation of that especially difficult sort, 
in spite of all your precautions for simplifying it. You 
are simply going to exhaust them by useless efforts 
and increase their depression and their excitement. 
In a word, it is certain that man can, by an appro- 
priate education, acquire new tendencies, and that this 
acquisition will be made easier by all the discoveries 
concerning the true mechanism of various forms of 
behavior. This principle should play an essential rdle 
in psychotherapy, but it isnot enough. Almost always, 
save in particularly simple cases, the problem of the 
acquisition of tendencies is made complex by the prob- 
lem of the acquisition of force.  
-P-A-G-E-223

2. INCREASE OF FORCE 
We are not concerned in philosophical speculation 
on vital forces, but simply in practical observation. 
The word “force” is here only the expression of a possi- 
bility of action. Forces are diminished when an indi- 
vidual can no longer do as much as he could formerly 
-and when he presents the disorders of the various forms 
of depression. Forces are increased when this indi- 
vidual again becomes capable of more activity, of walk- 
ing farther, of talking more, of reading and studying 
more than he was doing, when he no longer manifests © 
the impotence that characterizes neuropathic dis- 
orders. 
Such increases of force, indeed, are frequently offered 
for our observation when we see the numerous cases of 
patients suffering from exhaustion and depression who 
recover either for the time being or for a long period. 
The depressive neuroses are not necessarily incurable, 
but although they are subject to relapses, which is un- 
fortunately common, they usually present arrests or 
natural cures that must be taken into account. Even 
aside from the cure proper there are often observed 
during the course of the disease moments that the 
patients sometimes call “clear moments when the light 
stops growing faint,” during which disorders disappear 
and action again becomes possible. When these recov- 
eries are rapid they are like certain kinds of transient 
intoxication, and give rise to strong feelings of exalta- 
tion, of unspeakable happiness, analogous to the feel- 
ings of incompleteness and depression, but in the oppo-
-P-A-G-E-224
    216 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
site direction. “It is odd; all at once I am myself; I 
recognize the sound of my voice; I have confidence and 
peace of mind.” 
We may remark in passing that it is facts of this 
sort on which were based the singular theories of re- 
ligious conversion to which William James attached so 
much importance. It is probable that the pretended 
converts of whom he speaks and whose ecstatic feelings 
he describes were just unrecognized cases of depression 
who, during religious ceremonies, under some influence 
or other, displayed more or less lasting phenomena of 
excitement and feelings of unspeakable joy. If such 
facts are not important for theology, they remain, to 
my notion, very important for psychiatry. These clear 
moments with a temporary return of force offer us a 
problem as interesting as that of the cure itself. We 
should not only study the mechanism of the disease 
and the depression, but we should also seek to define 
the influences that cause restorations of strength. 
In many cases such augmentations of force are re- 
lated to some phenomena that we have already 
analyzed, cures of diseases and especially rest and econ- 
omy that occur without the knowledge of patient or 
physician. It is not impossible that many neuroses 
of periodic nature depend on certain alternations of 
excessive work leading to depressive disorders, and then 
on rest caused by the depression itself and leading to 
the cure. This cycle, once begun, is reproduced indefi- 
nitely. : 
This explanation is not enough for all cases. There 
are some in which the increase in force is brought about
-P-A-G-E-225
PSYCHIC INCOME 217 
temporarily and by accident before there was ade- 
quate rest. In these cases the change seems to be 
related to certain exterior physical phenomena or to 
certain forms of behavior of the patient. The most 
remarkable of such changes seem to be related to the 
ingestion of certain substances that have been called 
stimulating or intoxicating. They follow on taking 
alcohol, opium, or cocaine, for instance. 
These various substances, of which there is a con- 
siderable list, are really poisons. They cannot be used 
as food and in large doses they always cause severe 
disorders and even death. But taken in small doses, 
differing, of course, for each substance, they have re- 
sults that are quite different and somewhat peculiar. 
These phenomena usually deserve the name of intoxi- 
cations; they are made up of various forms of motor 
or mental excitement. Movements, words and thoughts 
are considerably increased, but there is at the same 
time a characteristic disturbance. There is an excess 
in amount, and, at the same time, a certain lowering 
of tension. In many cases, when we have neuropaths 
originally in a state of depression, such disorder does 
not appear. These patients find it difficult or impos- 
sible to reach a point of real intoxication. One of the 
great objections that alcoholics always make to their 
would-be reformers is “that they never get drunk; that 
they stand alcohol very well.” Not only does alcohol 
not cause in them the disorders of intoxication, it often 
succeeds in making the preceding disorders disappear 
and in restoring normal activity. “It is odd,” said a 
patient of that sort, “it is when I should be drunk that  
-P-A-G-E-226
  218 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
I enter a normal life; I then feel the ability to do 
what I wish; I become tireless; I can sketch myself 
a program and follow it; everything goes as if on 
rollers.’ Another, on the same topic: “I am really 
a reasonable and proper man only when I am full.” 
It is such psychological changes caused by intoxica- 
tion that are the real origin of alcoholism. It is neces- 
sary to understand them thoroughly if we wish to 
fight against that plague. 
Changes of the same kind can appear after eating 
or breathing, but the problem must be enlarged when 
we consider that such changes can appear after a great 
number of different activities. In our former study 
we have established that activity in an organism in- 
volves an outlay and can bring ruin. It is curious 
to notice now that activities, and often the same activi- 
ties, may have a quite contrary effect on patients. 
Certain circumstances that have forced the subject to 
an activity and an outlay seem to bring noticeable 
benefit and to increase strength. This fact is observed 
after activities of every kind, after religious ceremonies 
and social activities, as well as after violent movement 
or adaptation to change. 
I have always remembered a bizarre incident that 
once surprised me very much. A woman of forty, Bn., 
relapsing for the third time into a severe depression, 
was very ill for several months and seemed still far 
from the end of the attack. She was dining alone with 
her niece, a young woman in the last period of preg- 
nancy, when the latter was unexpectedly seized with 
1 Les médications psychologiques, III, p. 344.
-P-A-G-E-227
  PSYCHIC INCOME 219 
pains of labor. Bn. was obliged to care for her, and, 
while waiting for help that came too late, to super- 
intend the delivery. She felt over-excited and re- 
mained completely recovered from her melancholic 
depression. Observations of the same kind show us 
that the dangers to which patients are exposed do not 
always have bad effects. The war, which did much 
harm to many neuropaths, relieved some in an aston- 
ishing way and depressed subjects, sufferers from doubt 
and phobias became heroic soldiers. One picturesque 
writer, Téppfer, describing his travels in Switzerland, 
made the following observation: “It is a great pity 
that danger should be a thing at bottom so danger- 
ous; without that one would throw himself into it if 
only to experience that powerful joy, that grateful 
bound of the heart that goes with deliverance.” Marro, 
also, in his book on puberty, said: ‘He who has over- 
come a danger is like one who has gone through an 
infectious disease; he is vaccinated.” 
If one considers amorous adventures only from the 
single point of view of mental hygiene, one cannot 
always disapprove of them. Complicated and danger- 
ous as they are, they have often been the beginning 
of favorable stimulation. “There was fighting; there 
were terrible scenes; I risked being killed every day; 
that is living. All my life I have loved adventures, 
mystery, the unknown; I need them; I cannot live 
that monotonous and snug life; I lose my head.” 
Disease, the death of parents, the loss of a loved one, 
is not always the beginning of a great depression; it 
may restore strength and courage; “After the death of 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  220 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
my father real sorrow drove away imaginary fears 
and made me recover health and will.” We see by 
this that even difficult and painful action can have 
this same health-giving effect. 
A curious verification of the effect of taking intoxi- 
cants or of exciting activities is furnished us by the 
study of impulsions. Patients who show depression 
often have obsessions or impulsions of a special kind. 
They give constant expression to the thought of and 
the desire for certain acts whose execution would do 
them the greatest good and would reéstablish the integ- 
rity of their moral strength. “I am incomplete, I need 
something that would give me a start, the divine fire, 
and I know very well what I need to do.” The more 
they suffer from their depression, the more they feel 
driven to perform this liberating act. While the im- 
pulsions connected with ordinary obsessions, as, for 
instance, the pretended impulsions toward crime in 
cases of obsessions of scruple, are not followed by real 
performance, or reach only the beginnings of insignifi- 
cant acts, these impulsions toward acts that are excit- 
ing and are considered beneficial, are much more often 
carried out and often give rise to dangerous activity.? 
Impulsions of this kind vary considerably, and it is 
impossible to enumerate all of them. We may place 
in a first class the impulsions that are characterized 
by the pursuit of a simple act. In this class we shall 
include the dipsomanias, morphinomanias, the various 
toxicomanias, the impulsions to over-eat, the impul- 
sions to seek pain, the impulsions to walking and exces- 
2 Obsessions et psychasténie, 2d edition, 1908, pp. 56, 59.
-P-A-G-E-229
  PSYCHIC INCOME 221 
sive movement, the pursuit of sexual stimulation that 
gives rise to the various forms of erotomania. 
In a second and larger group we shall place all the 
forms of pursuit of stimulation by social acts, the 
impulsions toward domination that are so common, 
the manias of teasing, of sulking, the manias of scenes, 
manias of mischief, of cruelty, etc... . The impul- 
sions toward love are not always merely erotomanias; 
there often enters the need for all kinds of social 
stimulation. Neuropaths are ordinarily scrupulous and 
very timid, hence one is astonished to see in some of 
them an odd taste for scarcely moral adventures and 
for dangerous expeditions. This need is found in the 
amorous impulsions. Emma is quite conscious of this 
detail in the stimulation that she receives from lovers’ 
meetings: “Yes, the flesh is weak, but that is not the 
main thing. The anxiety and the shame that the least 
‘affair’ causes me are so delightful that I cannot grow 
tired of this temptation to sin. It is agreeable because 
you feel that it is not right; that makes you afraid 
and sorry and your heart beats fast, which gives you 
peace of mind and faith in life for a long time.” This 
is a sentence that the moralist will not understand at 
all, but the psychologist is well aware that the painful 
depression with its doubts, its restlessness, and its 
anxieties is not the same thing as remorse and that 
it exists before the sin. Sin itself and its remorse can, 
on the contrary, stimulate the mind, cause depression 
to vanish, and bring back peace of mind. In another 
aspect we also find stimulation from social danger in 
a group of very interesting facts, the kleptomanias,
-P-A-G-E-230
  222 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
and particularly thefts in the large stores. We shall 
have to return to this point to show the mental state 
that plays a chief part in this impulsion. 
Among these patients there should be recognized 
a group of impulsions of a higher order. These are 
the impulsions toward the excessive and sometimes 
quite inordinate exercise of the mind’s highest ten- 
dencies, the religious, moral, or even scientific ten- 
dencies. We find the same characteristics in these 
impulsions. In certain scenes of religious enthusiasm, 
as in the revivals described by William James, there 
can be noticed an uplift, a cure, following on exercises 
or feelings of a purely religious order. It is plain 
that many of these subjects consider religion a tonic 
and a remedy. They throw themselves into the de- 
lirium of the Cross and pursue God in order that He 
give them relief. The search for moral perfection can 
play the same part as religious exercises, and it is not 
hard to show that it can take on the nature of an 
impulsion in depressed subjects. Moral speeches are 
common: “I am at a place where I need to have 
something great to accomplish; that would cure me.” 
We find the search for intellectual stimulation also in 
romantic day dreams, in the passion for reading among 
neuropaths, “who have impulses to swallow libraries,” 
in the passion for writing stories and novels; it plays 
a large part in the writing manias described by M. 
Ossip Lourié. We find them again, alas, in psycholog- 
ical and philosophical studies, and metaphysics owes 
to them the construction of many systems. 
Most of these impulsions are, doubtless, very dan-
-P-A-G-E-231
  
PSYCHIC INCOME 223 
gerous. They cause intoxication or they lead the sub- 
ject into deplorable situations. From the point of 
view of nervous health, they lead to endless acts that 
can accomplish nothing and that in turn increase 
exhaustion. The great inconvenience of these impul- 
sions is their restricted character, their exclusiveness. 
One man imagines he will find happiness in drink or 
theft, another, in the love of a certain person, and each 
is unable to conceive anything beyond this, to such 
an extent is his mind restricted. We find here again 
the depressed subjects’ habitual defects of action, their 
lack of reflection, their tendency to get “stuck,” their 
incapacity for resignation and for change, their passion 
for effort and their obstinacy. “They think I am ener- 
getic because I never give up. I work indefinitely for 
my ends even when it is clear that I can get nowhere.” 
These dangers in the activity of impulsive subjects are 
thus in a way accidental. They come from the awk- 
ward way in which the acts have been executed. 
Moreover, when such inconvenience and danger has 
been recognized, it should not be concluded that such 
impulsions in subjects are entirely absurd or that they 
are never useful to the subject. They would not be 
so common and would not last so long if they really 
had no value. If we look upon them as always ridic- 
ulous or dangerous, this is because we are perhaps in a 
poor position for observation. The physician observes 
these impulsions only in the patient who consults him 
about them, that is, who resents their bad effects. In 
a word, we see impulsions only when their effect has 
miscarried. If it should happen that any such impul- 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  224 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
sion had a favorable action and rescued the subject 
from his depression, he would not visit the physician 
to complain of it, and we would not see him at that 
moment. To appreciate the effects of certain impul- 
sions we must examine them in subjects who are not 
complaining of them, in whom they exist without the 
physician’s knowing it, or, indeed, we must examine 
their previous effects before they became useless or 
harmless as they are now. If we submit to these con- 
ditions, we are compelled to admit that a large number 
of former impulsions have had good effects for a certain 
time at least, and that they comforted the patient and 
put an end to or diminished his depression. 
In an earlier work I have already quoted many ex- 
amples of such improvement, temporary at least, which 
was caused by the acts that subjects feel driven to 
perform. The record of an impulsion to steal in the 
large stores on which I dwelt at some length * seems 
to me quite conclusive on that point. To be brief, 
I said in conclusion that two attacks of mental de- 
pression, one the exact reproduction of the other, 
lasted eight to ten months. A third attack beginning 
in the same way was interrupted during a period of 
eight months in which there prevailed an impulsion 
to steal, and it began again as soon as this impulsion 
was blocked. In this case we can easily verify the close 
relationship that joins the impulsion to the depression, 
and we can note how the impulsion draws its force 
from the need for stimulation that develops in the 
course of the depression as the result of feelings of 
* Journal de psychologie, 1911, p. 97.
-P-A-G-E-233
  PSYCHIC INCOME 225 
incompleteness, and how it causes the depression to 
vanish. 
Observations of this sort could be multiplied indefi- 
nitely. They are not without interest. They show us 
that many persons can be really weak and nevertheless 
keep their moral health, thanks to more or less reason- 
able and proper activities which play the réle of stim- 
ulants, and that they fall ill as soon as this stimulation 
disappears. Excesses, gambling, the exercise of power, 
the search for love, intrigues of all kinds, the search for 
success, as well as literary or scientific work, sustain 
many people, and save them from decline and depres- 
sion. The pursuit of such stimulation seems to us 
quite natural when it occurs in individuals who main- 
tain their normal tension, that is to say, when it suc- 
ceeds; we describe it as a pathological impulsion when 
it becomes inadequate or when it does not succeed. 
The psychologist has no right to disregard utterly these 
impulsions of psychasthenics because they have now 
become bad or absurd. He should obviously not encour- 
age them when they have taken this dangerous form, 
and it is not a question of urging Mme. V. to resume 
her thefts in the large stores. But it is necessary to 
see what was good, though only for a moment, in these 
impulsions, what made them useful, in order to save 
and use this favorable part, if that is possible. 
In a word, any act may become the beginning of a 
favorable stimulation. A banal observation may sum 
up the foregoing remarks; we know that most of these 
subjects have a bad period in the morning when they 
are waking, and that they are ordinarily improved dur-
-P-A-G-E-234
  226 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
ing the course of the day and in the evening. It is 
probable that this change is caused by complex influ- 
ences; nourishment and light should play a part. But 
it is also necessary to recognize the accumulation of 
acts, even minor ones, that the subject has to perform, 
and that bring about a gradually increasing stimula- 
tion toward the end of the day. While we have pre- 
viously seen that acts, and especially that difficult acts, 
exhaust and depress, we see that in other records the 
same acts can have an entirely opposite influence. This 
is a contradiction that raises an important problem in 
psychology. 
3. THE THREE LAWS OF STIMULATION 
We have previously considered the expense caused 
by an act; it is now necessary for us to understand the 
good effect that it may bring. In my more complete 
study of this subject I showed that certain acts are 
useful by virtue of the adjustment and discharge that 
they cause, that others allow the organization of ten- 
dencies of future advantage and economy. But the 
immediate benefit that appears in stimulation depends 
on another mechanism. 
We could indicate the first principle of stimulation 
by the name principle of the mobilization of forces * 
and place this notion under the patronage of William 
James because it is inspired by his book, “The Ener- 
gies of Men,” which is full of interesting notions. Not 
only the normal man, but even the most depressed 
invalid, is able, under the pressure of serious events, 
“Cf. Les médications psychologiques, III, p. 213.
-P-A-G-E-235
  PSYCHIC INCOME 227 
to display an activity that is quite unexpected and al- 
together out of proportion with the minimum amount 
of force that he seemed to have at his disposition an 
instant before. This shows that the man did not have 
constantly at his disposition all the forces that he pos- 
sesses, and that he keeps somewhere in reserve a great 
quantity of force. The amount of these reserves must 
be very variable. It is probable that certain persons 
do not have enough force in reserve and that others 
keep too much; but all maintain an amount that is 
much greater than one would think from their ordi- 
nary conduct. Where are these reserves placed? We 
cannot answer from the anatomical point of view, for 
we know very little of the origin of the forces spent 
in action. From the psychological point of view we 
may say that the reserves are placed in latent ten- 
dencies that are ready to act with a determinate force 
at the moment of stimulation. 
A tendency is not only a disposition to produce a 
series of definite movements in connection with a defi- 
nite stimulation. It is also a reserve of a definite 
amount of force capable of producing this series of 
movements under good conditions. At the moment 
a tendency is formed it is not only necessary to organ- 
ize the series of movements; it is also necessary to 
place in reserve the amount of force that makes up 
the endowment of the tendency. This is one of the 
reasons for the difficulty and for the expense that is 
manifested by the organization of a new tendency. 
The size of this endowment is variable according to the 
tendency in question: it clearly seems much more con-
-P-A-G-E-236
  228 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
siderable for primitive and fundamental tendencies 
and much more reduced for higher and recently formed 
tendencies. Pain, the tendency to avoidance, fear, the 
tendency to flight, anger, the tendency to attack, the 
tendency to eat, and the sexual tendency obviously 
have a strong charge. The rational and moral tenden- 
cies, on the contrary, have unfortunately received a. 
very small endowment. 
The present activity of an individual, the amount 
of force that he can dispose of in his activity, do not 
depend on the total energy deposited in his reserves, 
but on the energy now available, on what is now 
mobilized according to the tendency that is aroused. 
The reserves of our vital instinct, or of our sexual 
instinct, do not stir when we force ourselves to pay 
attention to a mathematical argument, and we can 
show ourselves very poor at that moment, while we 
are rich at other times. In this connection we might 
resume our comparison: the work of an industrial 
enterprise does not depend solely on its total capital, 
but on its circulating capital, on its operating fund. 
Such an enterprise may have great wealth in reserves 
sunk in buildings, in machines, in financial invest- 
ments, in credits that are hard to collect, and it may 
at a given moment be able to dispose of only a small 
amount of cash. It may even find itself for long 
periods embarrassed, obliged to retrench, and unable 
to spend the large amounts that would be useful. It 
may be, and this is the idea that William James ex- 
presses, that the mind of a neuropath is often in a 
like situation, that he has considerable wealth in re-
-P-A-G-E-237
  
PSYCHIC INCOME 229 
serve but hard to reach, and that he finds himself 
now reduced to an inadequate amount of available 
energy, though he has considerable energy invested 
in a reserve. 
In cases of this sort it is very important to be able 
to mobilize the reserves and a serious event that forces 
them to come out of their hiding place may perform 
the greatest service. In the factory an accident such 
as a fire or a necessary removal can compel recourse 
to insurance, the release of special funds, or the calling 
in of credits. It is quite probable that the monetary 
reserves so mobilized will exceed the immediate need 
during the accident itself. The money thus brought 
to light will not merely serve to repair the effects of 
the accident. It will circulate in all departments and 
restore prosperity everywhere. The feeling of a great 
danger, what we call a great emotion, can have the 
same effect on the mind; it forces us to perform ener- 
getic acts that cannot take place without calling on 
reserve capital that mobilizes large forces. As a con- 
sequence of the change in the distribution of forces 
all activity finds itself immediately transformed. 
This appeal to reserves will have all the more suc- 
cess in that it will be directed toward the richer ten- 
dencies, those that are more heavily charged, and, as 
we have seen, are more elementary. Subjects them- 
selves remark that a little opposition disturbs and 
exhausts them a great deal, while a great misfortune 
gives them all their energy. The minor opposition 
arouses only higher tendencies to resignation or to re- 
flection, while the great misfortune arouses deep ten- 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  
  230 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
dencies to the defence of social esteem, to the preserva- 
tion of family, of fortune, or of life. The mobilization 
was small and inadequate in the first case; it is enor- 
mous and superabundant in the second. 
The action of intoxicants can be explained in the 
same way. The introduction of a poison into the or- 
ganism arouses the vital instinct, puts all functions 
on guard, and, like the beginning of a war, causes a 
mobilization of all the organism’s forces. This restores 
every activity, and, if the dose of poison is really not 
very large, this causes an excess of forces more or less 
well used according to the case. But if taking poison 
continues in increasing doses, if war lasts too long, the 
organism’s reserves become exhausted, intoxication and 
the enemy establish themselves and depression be- 
comes so great that nothing further can banish it. 
Often, indeed, the increase of forces following on a 
mobilization of this sort is only temporary, and it is 
followed by a greater exhaustion. This is commonly 
observed among asthenics who excel themselves in 
danger and who then fall back to a very low level for 
a long time. I do not think, however, that this is 
always the case. I have reported many observations 
in which this return of forces was not followed by an 
exhaustion, and caused a permanent change. The fact 
is certain even if it cannot be explained. The organ- 
ism seems to be made in such a way that certain 
reservoirs of forces must be always full. We have 
tendencies that must be normally charged for our 
defence. The maternal instinct, the vital instinct, even 
when they have just operated, are immediately re-
-P-A-G-E-239
PSYCHIC INCOME 231 
charged so as to be quickly ready to confront a new 
danger. The organism is then obliged to furnish new 
forces rapidly in order to fill the gap in its reserves. 
The expenditure of reserves probably leads to a stim- 
ulation of all functions, and, if it is not repeated too 
often, it can cause a more intense vital functioning 
which causes the state of asthenia to vanish. This is 
why such mobilization of reserves, which clearly has 
dangers, has sometimes beneficial and lasting effects. 
This conception, however, of the mobilization of 
forces placed in reserve in lower tendencies is not 
enough for the solution of the problem of stimulation. 
There must be added to it the second principle of psy- 
chological equilibrium. 
In a depressed patient the augmentation of forces 
does not always suffice to bring back normal activity. 
When this wealth of forces occurs by itself we observe 
another phenomenon, that of excitement; we note the 
disorders that we have just seen in intoxication, an 
excess of lower conduct, exaggerated and useless, unor- 
ganized and faulty. It is not always true that neuro- 
paths and the insane immediately make a step for- 
ward from the moral point of view when they have 
been rested and strengthened. Moreau of Tours had 
already remarked some time ago that certain patients 
have furious delirium after a good night’s sleep and 
that they remain calm if they have not slept well. I 
had occasion to describe many cases of this sort in 
my last book on “Les médications psychologiques.” ® 
In the course of certain restorative treatments by vari- 
* Les médications psychologiques, 1919, II, p. 94,

  232 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
ous tonics one sees an increase of weight, an improve- 
ment of the visible strength that makes possible more 
powerful, longer continued, and more rapid action, and 
at the same time an increase of suffering, of obsessions, 
and of delirium. 
The opposite phenomenon is still more interesting. 
It has to do with the apparent improvement of the 
neurosis through a profound weakening of the organ- 
ism that diminishes force. The following record, which 
I have just collected, may be considered as typical of 
a great number of others. A young man of thirty- 
five had been for several months in a full attack, in- 
capable of any action, tormented by doubts, feelings 
of deprivation and shame, and especially by the obses- 
sion of death and the obsession of madness. In a 
word he was in a state of great anxious excitement. 
He was attacked by a non-diphtheritic angina, that 
was, however, very serious, with an abscess of the 
pharynx, temperatures of 102° and 104° for several 
days, the almost complete interruption of nourishment, 
and he had to stand frequent minor operations that 
were very painful. During these and during the fol- 
lowing weeks he was extremely weakened and could 
scarcely hold himself erect, but at the same time he 
presented a radical and marvelous change. He had no 
more anxiety, and, although he had really been in 
danger, he thought neither of death nor of insanity. 
He received treatment with the greatest confidence, 
without expressing any misgiving; he bravely stood 
the very painful minor operations. “This physical suf- 
fering,” he said, “is nothing beside my former mental 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
PSYCHIC INCOME 233 
suffering.” He made important resolutions easily. In 
a word all the symptoms of the neurosis seemed to 
have vanished. The psychic disorders did not reap- 
pear until three weeks after the cure of the throat, 
at a moment when the patient seemed to be regaining 
his strength. One sees like occurrences in many 
patients; an influenza, typhoid fever, erysipelas, have 
an astonishing sedative effect on nervous disorders. 
There are many records of cases of melancholia cured 
by typhoid fever, of obsession and anxiety calmed by 
febrile diseases, even of numerous epileptics who no 
longer have any attacks during pneumonia or during 
convalescence. After having established some facts 
of this sort in one of my old records, I assumed that 
in these cases the improvement was due to the fever, 
connected with the intoxication.© That explanation 
does not fit all the cases, for the improvement is shown 
in the period of convalescence when the patients no 
longer have fever and are no longer intoxicated, but 
while they are still weakened. In all these cases the 
weakening seems to be a condition of the mental 
improvement.” 
This is what explains the phenomenon of discharge 
which is so curious. Many nervous disorders, convul- 
sive attacks, attacks of weeping, cases of great excite- 
ment seem to be great expenditures of forces. How 
does it happen that there is often observed a certain 
improvement following these crisis, at least an appar- 
ent improvement? How often one sees agitated,

-P-A-G-E-242
  234 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
anxious, and more or less delirious patients who fall 
into convulsive attacks, throw themselves about and 
struggle for hours, who then recover, doubtless with 
a certain fatigue, but with a feeling of delightful calm, 
happier and really more normal than before the attack. 
After emotion or turmoil of any sort many women feel 
that they need to stir, to cry out, to take violent exer- 
cise, and declare that they would be much better if 
they could smash something. They are not entirely 
mistaken, for violent exercise, whether they seek it 
voluntarily or not, can have results that are identical 
with those of the attack and in several records patients 
know how to calm their doubt and their anxiety by 
some great expenditure of force. 
Some authors, a few only, like Ch. Féré, have already 
occupied themselves with these facts and have tried 
to give them a physiological explanation by saying 
that the nervous system cannot stand a great tension 
and that it discharges as soon as that tension rises, 
It seems to me useless and dangerous to translate 
these psychological facts immediately into a physiolog- 
ical language which is at present entirely arbitrary, 
and I have myself tried for many years to give these 
facts a correct psychological expression by taking as a 
beginning the clear definitions of tension and of psychic 
force. This is what led me to my extended studies 
on the hierarchy of tendencies and on the degrees of 
activation. 
Psychic force, that is, the power, the number, and 
the duration of movements, ought not to be confused 
with psychic tension, characterized by the degree of
-P-A-G-E-243
PSYCHIC INCOME 235 
activation and the hierarchical degree of acts. It is 
probable that in normal behavior in well-balanced 
individuals a certain relationship must be maintained 
between available force and tension, and that it is not 
good to maintain a great force when tension has low- 
ered; the result is excitement and disorder. A com- 
parison allows the illustration of this little known law; 
individuals who are not accustomed to order and econ- 
omy do not know how to behave and run risks if they 
have all at once in their hands a large sum of money. 
“Tf I am disgracefully drunk,” one poor woman told 
me, “it is the fault of my employer who gave me sev- 
enty francs all at once. I cannot stand more than 
twenty-five francs at a time. What do you expect? 
I did not know what to do with seventy francs so I 
drank them.” Through the execution of acts of high 
level which are costly and beneficial, and through the 
reserve force that results from the last stages of such 
activity, psychic tension makes possible the utilization 
of much available force. But when such tension is 
weak it is better to dispose of only small forces and 
hence it is in certain cases beneficial to get rid of 
them in any fashion so as to reéstablish the proportion 
between force and tension that will make possible an 
activity, doubtless lower, but more suitable and less 
dangerous. Such is the general idea of discharge which 
plays an important part in the interpretation of many 
pathological phenomena. 
In actual treatment interest is directed only at the 
acquisition of force, understood as power, rapidity, and 
duration of movements, without any attention to ten- 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  236 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
sion, that is to the degree of activation of higher ten- 
dencies. But this is a mistake, for the nervous or 
mental diseases, even though they are often accom- 
panied by weakness, are something different from a 
simple organic or muscular enfeeblement. Simple 
weakness, complete znemia, or the cachetic state of 
tuberculous or cancerous subjects are not psychas- 
thenia or melancholia. It is doubtless hoped or taken 
for granted that the tension will rise of itself as the 
result of the augmentation of forces. That sometimes 
happens, but it is neither general nor necessary, and, 
when the restoration of forces occurs alone, there fol- 
lows only excitement and disorder. It is necessary 
to pay more and more attention to raising tension in 
order to reéstablish psychic equilibrium. 
The reéstablishment of the normal state does not 
admit an unequal and partial restoration of funetions. 
It supposes that all functions are restored at the same 
time. This is what one may indicate by the third prin- 
ciple, the principle of irradiation or of psychic syn- 
tonization. 
The mind possesses mechanisms that harmonize the 
various activities with each other, that give behavior 
a certain unity of tone. Not only does an energetic 
act put at our disposition a greater quantity of forces, 
but further, in various ways, it should bring the whole 
mind to function with a higher tension. There are in 
us mechanisms and tendencies whose part it is to raise 
or lower tension according to circumstances. Changes 
in the sympathetic nervous system, changes in the 
secretions of the endocrine glands must here play an
-P-A-G-E-245
  
PSYCHIC INCOME 237 
important part, but we must first have a good under- 
standing of the psychic phenomenon and the alter- 
ation of behavior before we are able to discover their 
physiological conditions. From the beginning of life 
the living being knows how to perform the act of sleep- 
ing and the act of waking, and these acts, among other 
modifications, cause great changes in psychic tension. 
Later on he knows likewise how to relax in repose, in 
play, in confidence, and how to grow tense, to put all 
his tendencies in a state of readiness, when there is a 
difficulty, danger, or a wait. When we rest, when we 
relax in the midst of friends, when we sleep, we lower 
the tension; on the other hand, when we begin an act, 
when we are in public, when we prepare for a contest, 
or when we simply wake, we become more tense. An 
important act, and especially a successful act, arouses 
just these tendencies to take a general attitude of high 
tension. Popular language recognizes the existence of 
these phenomena better than psychology when it 
speaks of “taking it easy; keeping an eye open; being 
ready for anything; being all set.” At the extreme of 
these phenomena of stimulation are found the heat of 
composition and creative enthusiasm. An artist re- 
cently told me that he needs to put himself into a 
special condition to compose, that he can do nothing 
at the start, then he warms up little by little, that 
“then he has three times his usual life” and that he is 
then exhausted for several days. 
In all the foregoing records we see many facts that 
can be included under this conception. People who 
have accomplished a theft, the man who has offered a 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
238 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
toast in a cabaret, those who have succeeded in being 
obeyed, or simply in causing suffering, those who have 
received a compliment, take a conqueror’s attitude 
and maintain it for some time even while performing 
other acts. This remark is so obvious that I have often 
found it made by patients themselves. “A compliment 
from the general,” says Bf., a man of twenty-seven, 
“and I recover like a horse at a touch of the whip; I 
remain more energetic for several days, because I 
remain a man whom the general congratulates.” “My 
daughter,” says Zob., a woman of fifty, “must say to 
me continually: you are the most adorable of women 
and everyone adores you. That makes me hold myself 
erect as a woman whom people adore, instead of being 
downcast as a woman overwhelmed with scorn.” Theft 
is a success for Lov., a woman of thirty-eight, who has 
read many detective stories and who congratulates 
herself on being so clever: “Oh, the fear of being seen, 
the struggle against danger, against my conscience that 
says: What are you doing? and the triumph! All 
that makes me raise my head, makes my eyes bril- 
liant, and I remain under that influence.” In all these 
records the tension required by the act has caused a 
general attitude of tension that has lasted for more 
or less time. We have here a phenomenon that we 
may call a psychic irradiation, and it would be cor- 
rectly opposed to the phenomenon of distraction that 
we have studied in depression. 
Putting forces into circulation can hence bring 
about a new distribution of forces, under certain favor- 
able conditions which we shall have to seek. When
-P-A-G-E-247
  PSYCHIC INCOME 239 
there are heavy expenditures there can be good invest- 
ments at the same time. An act of a higher level can 
be secured and this causes a change of level in the 
whole mind. It is the totality of these changes of 
behavior that constitutes stimulation, which, more- 
over, must not be confused with excitement. Stim- 
ulation consists essentially in a quick rise of psychic 
tension above the point where it has remained for 
some time. This rise should evidently appear in two 
different forms. In the first we have to do with an 
actual rise above the average level that characterizes 
what we consider our normal spirits. Such stimula- 
tion should then correspond to the phenomena called 
enthusiasm and inspiration. It should play a part in 
works of genius, in inventions, and in the progress of 
thought, but it is little known and plays no part at 
all in these therapeutic studies. Another form of stim- 
ulation has been more studied. This is the one that 
appears in some patients and that merely raises the 
tension, previously lowered, to the mean level con- 
sidered normal. The increase of forces, the great laws 
of mobilization, of equilibrium, of psychic irradiation 
make this change possible. 
4, STIMULATION IN THE PSYCHOTHERAPIES 
There are forms of stimulation more or less con- 
sciously sought for and used in various psycho- 
logical treatments. In several, they are used without 
taking account of their real nature, by disguising them 
under other names. In studying mental agencies in 
general we have just observed that miraculous cures
-P-A-G-E-248
  240 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
at sacred springs or in the magnetist’s cabinet very 
often depend on a nervous and mental stimulation 
caused in an individual by the part he was made to 
play. 
The observation we have just made can be repeated 
in connection with many other treatments apparently 
more scientific. Many physiological treatments that 
restore general health, activate digestion, circulation, 
and the glandular secretions, cause a more intense vital 
activity. The patient regains confidence in himself, 
becomes capable of more activity, and raises his ten- 
sion, and this alters all his behavior and suppresses a 
large number of neuropathic symptoms. Many sub- 
stances, as we have seen, act through their intoxicating 
power. They are doubtless dangerous and it is neces- 
sary to combat the intoxication caused by their abuse. 
It is also necessary to combat the exclusive nature of 
the impulsion and to seek other and varied sources 
of stimulation, to make the patient feel that there are 
forms of mental stimulation like the forms of physio- 
logical stimulation, and it is above all necessary to 
lessen the need for stimulation by diminishing the de- 
pression itself. But this done, these stimulating sub- 
stances which have their part in establishing psychic 
tonus must not be suppressed completely without ask- 
ing ourselves with what are we going to replace them. 
Opium, which plays the réle of popular stimulant in 
certain countries, is considered a medicament by physi- 
cians, and in melancholic disorders it is generously 
used. It can render some service in the majority of 
depressions. The medicament that to-day seems to
-P-A-G-E-249
  PSYCHIC INCOME 241 
be most in fashion for causing stimulation is strych- 
nine. Recent studies have shown that habitual 
doses of this drug can be increased with advan- 
tage. But alcohol is a medicament like opium and 
strychnine, and there is no need to be ashamed 
to allow a little wine when strychnine is openly 
prescribed. 
The methods of treatment by education present a 
difficulty, namely, that they demand effort and expense 
at the start. There is no education without commands, 
without encouragement, without example, without 
even threats. The part of the educator is not limited 
to pointing out acts, it consists also in getting them 
done and imparting the force to do them. The best 
educator is the one who knows how to stimulate. 
It is especially in the treatment by liquidation which 
is the basis of psychoanalytic treatments that indirect 
stimulation plays an important part. We have under- 
stood that such liquidation brought in its train great 
economies which permitted the restoration of force. 
But how is the liquidation itself brought about that 
does away with the fixed idea of the traumatic event 
and all the endless work of the obsession? How can 
the reappearance of the memory in consciousness and 
the expression of this memory stop the evolution? 
Doubtless such hard and painful expression brings a 
discharge of the forces mobilized about the memory. 
But why does the traumatic reminiscence, once dis- 
charged by confession, not recharge itself immedi- 
ately? To my notion, there has not been merely a 
discharge; there has been a discharge through an oper-
-P-A-G-E-250
  242 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
ation of high tension, the assimilation, which has ad- 
justed the situation, which has reéstablished forces 
which has restored the reserve, and which has stopped 
mobilization. The reminiscence became traumatic 
only because the reaction to the event was faulty. 
Whether by reason of a depression already in existence 
through other causes, whether by reason of a depres- 
sion brought about at the time itself through emotional 
disturbance, the subject has not been able to make, 
or has made only a part of that assimilation which is 
the internal adaptation of the person to the event. 
It is this task that he is continuing to perform, and 
that is exhausting him; it is this task that he some- 
times brings to an end by himself after months and 
years, when he recovers spontaneously. He must be 
caused to do this quickly by helping him in this task 
in the same way in which we have arrested crises 
caused by present problems by helping the subject to 
perform the necessary external acts. He must now be 
helped to perform the internal acts connected with 
the past events. 
“When one has committed an error or a folly,” A. 
Forel aptly said, “he should hasten, first, to repair all 
that can be repaired; second, to take preventive meas- 
ures for avoiding its repetition in the future, and, third, 
to put it all out of mind.” We should do the same 
when the faults of others are concerned. The familiar 
expressions that are endlessly repeated, “get used to it, 
forget, forgive, give up, renounce, be resigned,” always 
seem to mean simple phenomena of consciousness. 
There is nothing in consciousness but action and the
-P-A-G-E-251
  PSYCHIC INCOME 243, 
derivatives of action. These expressions really indi- 
cate a complicated body of real activities, acts that 
must be performed, other actions that must be re- 
pressed, new attitudes to adopt, and there are all those 
activities that adjust the situation and that cause one 
to be resigned to it. A woman is very seriously ill 
following a break with her lover. You say it is because 
she cannot resign herself. Doubtless, but this want of 
resignation consists of a series of actions that she con- 
tinues to perform and that she must stop performing. 
The physician must help this woman to stop all these 
absurd acts, teach her to perform others, give her an- 
other attitude. To forget the past is really to change 
behavior in the present. When she has reached this 
new behavior it matters little that she still keeps the 
verbal memory of her adventure, she is cured of her 
neuropathic disorder. 
The record of Irene seems to me especially inter- 
esting, because we have seen the absurd behavior that 
she presented, in entire contradiction with her situ- 
ation, and because we have roughly established in her 
amnesia the missing elements of inner assimilation. 
After long work, which I described in my first study 
on this patient, I succeeded in making her recover, 
or rather construct the discourse-memory of her 
mother’s death. It is from the moment when she had 
command of this memory, when she was able to express 
it without accompanying it with crises and hallucina- 
tions, that the assimilated event ceased to be trau- 
matic. The assimilation was the result of a complete 
change in considerable behavior, and the subject could
-P-A-G-E-252
  
244 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
perform this task only by working herself up and 
emerging from her depression. The phenomenon of 
stimulation is at the bottom of all treatments of fixed 
ideas through liquidation. 
In some other forms of treatment this réle of stim- 
ulation is somewhat more apparent, although it may 
as yet be often misunderstood. I have in mind the odd 
practices of metallotherapy, of esthesiogeny, of the 
provocation of complete somnambulism. First let us 
recall the essential facts: neuropaths presenting acci- 
dents of all sorts can be changed in a speedy fashion 
in such a way as to lose all their disorders at once 
and regain their normal health. These transformations 
are obtained by methods that are apparently different, 
passes, application of various substances to the skin, 
electric currents, gymnastic exercises, orders and con- 
versation relating to sensation and memory. These 
transformations are accompanied by very characteristic 
feelings of confidence and joy; they are, however, tem- 
porary and end by a more or less sudden and more or 
less complete relapse that returns the subject to his 
previous sick condition. This relapse is often accom- 
panied by an amnesia for the preceding happy period. 
These transformations can be brought about again, 
generally with greater ease, and they contribute to the 
complete restoration of the subject. What must we 
think of this group of phenomena—or rather, by what 
tie should we try to join all these facts with each 
other? This is the problem of the interpretation of 
esthesiogeny. 
It is easy to eliminate the surmises of the first
-P-A-G-E-253
  PSYCHIC INCOME 245 
authors who were too ready to grant an outer physical 
agent acting on the organism, fluids, magnetic action, 
weak electric currents. None of these forms of action 
could be positively demonstrated, and moreover it has 
been proved from the evidence itself that all these 
phenomena can be reproduced without the intervention 
of any material agent. It is unfortunately not open 
to question that there can now be only psychological 
theories of these complex phenomena. 
I have discussed at some length the interpretation 
by suggestion which accounts for only a part of the 
facts. Many details of wsthesiogeny are opposed to 
the mechanism of suggestion. One fact in particular 
seems to me essential; there is in complete somnam- 
bulism a considerable alteration of total behavior that 
I think characteristic. What astonishes me in this 
alteration of behavior is not the complexity of the 
automatism; it is the diminution of the automatism 
and the development of the activity of new adaptation. 
The patients, as I have said, become less suggestible, 
and it is singular enough that suggestion should reduce 
suggestibility, but besides this, the subjects’ practical 
activity is transformed. It is no longer a question of 
developing as complex an automatism as is believed. 
It is a question of new acts, unforeseen, of adaptations 
and of a new synthesis of which the subject becomes 
more and more capable to the extent that he becomes, 
on the other hand, less suggestible. Can it still be 
said that suggestion does all this? This is not possible, 
to my notion, unless we give the word “suggestion” a 
very wide meaning, including all possible psychological
-P-A-G-E-254
    246 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
phenomena. This is not allowable if we understand 
the word as I have proposed, in the exact sense of the 
development of a preéxisting automatism. Hence I 
believe that we may reach a conclusion on these rela- 
tions of suggestion and esthesiogeny. It is evident 
that suggestion here plays an enormous réle. It deter- 
mines the form that the transformation takes at the 
start; I believe even that it determines the beginning 
of the transformation, that it in some way sets it off. 
It is because the subjects are suggestible hysterics that 
they can be made to begin such a task in connection 
with certain signs or certain particular commands. 
But suggestion here applies to a special act having 
some characteristics peculiar to itself. It is a sug- 
gestion of a quite special sort and it seems to me 
necessary to distinguish it from others. 
The state that is brought about by ewsthesiogeny, a 
state that has often been called the alert state, and 
that, in certain cases, constitutes complete somnam- 
bulism, offers us a change of behavior that is much 
better described by the notion of stimulation. The 
fluctuations that are brought about by these practices 
are like those observed in periodic and alternating 
neuroses. 
Stimulation seems to appear in connection with 
changes in conscious sensation, but it is very likely 
that this is only one occasion; the same stimulation 
can be brought about in connection with memory and 
probably in connection with other events. Sometimes 
weak changes in sensation are enough to cause great 
stimulation and, conversely, great changes in sensa-
-P-A-G-E-255
PSYCHIC INCOME 247 
tion may take place automatically without causing 
apparent stimulation. 
Hence it is likely that the important thing is the 
effort the subject makes to obey an order to carry out 
the suggestion aroused by a signal of some kind. This, 
indeed, requires attention and work. We notice this 
in the signs of effort, in the contortions that certain 
subjects present. We see this also in noting the time 
necessary for bringing about such metamorphoses. The 
rapid changes brought about by suggestion pure and 
simple do not have at all the same results as the 
changes brought about slowly through real work. “You 
wish to go too far and too fast; that is what makes 
my head ache and makes me distracted.” Finally, 
we also note such labor in that odd fatigue that follows 
the séance, a fatigue that is very noticeable and very 
regular when there has been a real stimulation, while 
it is lacking when there has been no stimulation worth 
mention. 
We have seen that a man can make himself tense 
and put himself in a state of creative enthusiasm. I 
cannot help believing that our subjects do something 
of the same sort, and that in their case, in certain 
conditions, the order, or, if you will, the suggestion to 
feel and to remember, releases special tendencies to 
effort and even to enthusiasm. Those operations that 
would raise the tension of a normal man to the extent 
of putting him in a state of creative activity, succeed 
in the depressed in restoring them to normal tension. 
If the forms of psychic stimulation are disguised in 
most of the foregoing methods, they are, on the con-  
-P-A-G-E-256
    248 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
trary, quite evident in the moral therapies that make 
use of work, faith or guidance. In all impulsions, there 
is found the need for being stimulated by an action; 
in all the manias for being loved or for being guided 
there is found the need for being revived and excited 
by another person. We see this when we study those 
patients who appear to be normal so long as they are 
subject to the influence of certain persons, and who 
relapse into depression and disorder as soon as they 
have lost the one who, making them act, kept the 
tension of their mind at a higher level. The physician 
only satisfies this same need for direction and stimula- 
tion in a more methodical fashion. We see in medical 
guidance the same facts as in the accidental forms of 
guidance and the same ups and downs. After a visit 
that has been a success there is a period of influence 
during which the patient is revived and preserves 
the feeling of his director’s presence near him, as 
the mystic feels the presence of his God. Then there 
follows a new period of depression with an urge that I 
have called somnambulistic passion, during which the 
subject falls back into depression and feels abandoned 
and alone like the mystics in their periods of dryness.® 
In all these treatments there is always involved a more 
or less lasting stimulation. 
How has the director caused this transient stimula- 
tion? Certain activities are exciting, as we have 
shown. They have accidentally revived the subject 
and he anxiously seeks to reproduce them. But he 
does not know how to choose his acts and he does not 
1 Op. Cit., III, p. 393.  
-P-A-G-E-257
  PSYCHIC INCOME 249 
know how to unite the favorable conditions that allow 
their execution. 
This is the cause of all the disorders and the evil 
results of impulsions. The director should know better 
what are those favorable acts that can be executed 
without too great expense and that cause favorable 
stimulation. He knows the conditions in which it is 
necessary to place the subject to have him succeed in 
the performance of these acts, and how he must be 
aided. He uses all the methods of suggestion, of per- 
suasion, all the methods of rhetoric for encouraging 
action and stimulating the patient. 
A singular procedure this, that appeals to the finest 
powers of human genius in order to allow an hysteric 
to eat her soup. With these patients we are often 
forced to have recourse to procedures of this kind, and 
I have already often remarked that it is necessary to 
use the most eloquent pleas and to use all the devices 
of rhetoric to get a patient to change his shirt or drink 
a glass of water. It is to this that I called particular 
attention in my first studies. “The treatment to which 
I subject the patient is not merely a suggestion, but 
also a stimulation. In psychological treatment the 
part of suggestion has not always been distinguished 
from the part of stimulation, which tries to raise the 
mental level. From Irene I demand attention and 
efforts; I demand an increasingly clear consciousness 
of feelings, all things which are a means for raising 
nervous and mental tension, for bringing about, if you 
will, the functioning of higher centers. I have often 
verified, in her case, as with so many other patients,
-P-A-G-E-258
  250 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
that the really useful interviews were those in which I 
succeeded in stirring her. It is often necessary to re- 
proach her, to find directions in which she has remained 
impressionable, to give her all sorts of moral jolts to 
restore her and make her recover memories and acts.” 
All the forms of re-education of neuropaths so much 
discussed to-day are subject to the same law. Whether 
they are concerned with gymnastics, the education of 
movements, the stimulation of sensibility, the investi- 
gation of memories, it is always necessary that the 
leadership of the director arouse attention and effort, 
stimulate emotion, and cause a higher tension. When 
such improved functioning is obtained, the subject 
feels a change of his whole consciousness which is 
translated into an increase of perception and of ac- 
tivity. 
Such a therapy is a surprise at the start, because it 
seems quite opposed to the forms of treatment that 
have formerly seemed to us rational and useful, the 
forms that we have studied under the name of treat- 
ments by rest and by economy of forces. It seems 
odd to try to cure exhausted individuals by making 
them work, and to avoid bankruptcy by advising new 
outlays. This is, however, not entirely unintelligible, 
for we have just seen that action does not confine 
itself to wasting forces, but often it renews them as 
well. A good investment, a clever speculation can 
make an outlay very profitable. Actually these forms 
of treatment are contradictory only in appearance, and 
both forms may remain justifiable and useful accord- 
ing to the case.

CHAPTER I 
APPLICATIONS 
The treatments that have been presented as appli- 
cations of psychological science are based on exact ob- 
servations and interpretations. It is true, nevertheless, 
that at every period they have been much disputed, 
that they are rarely employed with confidence and that 
they scarcely ever give all the practical results for 
which one had the right to hope. We must endeavor 
to find under what conditions their effectiveness may 
be increased and to verify whether or not there are 
certain cases in which they are of considerable value. 
1, PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC DIAGNOSIS 
Too often what I have said in connection with mira- 
cles and medical moralization applies to psychothera- 
peutic treatment. In a general way such treatments 
seem to be efficacious; if a great number of cases are 
considered, there are a certain number of cures that 
may be legitimately ascribed to them. But regarding 
a particular case, nothing can be affirmed in advance, 
and nothing can be taught definitely. One finds him- 
self confronted by an application of the law of aver- 
ages and the efficacy of these treatments seems to de- 
pend on chance. On the one hand this is due to the 
fact that most of these methods are defined in a very 
253 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  254 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
vague way and on the other hand to the fact that they 
are applied in too arbitrary a fashion. 
The efficacy of a therapy depends on the diagnosis: 
quinine or salvarsan would have the same random 
effects if they were applied as psychotherapies are ap- 
plied. Each psychotherapist praises his own method, 
which he claims is original, and inclines to apply it to 
everything because it cures everything. One moralizes, 
the other hypnotizes everybody; one man rests and 
fattens, another psychoanalyzes at random. What 
would be thought of a physician who would boast of 
giving digitalis to all his patients while his fellow phy- 
sician’s specialty was the giving of arsenic? 
During the triumphant period of hypnotism, several 
years ago, they boasted of hypnotizing 97 per cent of 
the patients and of practicing suggestion on everyone 
who presented himself. When one considers to-day 
these amusing statistics it is plain to be seen that their 
authors had no desire to get a precise notion of the 
phenomenon that they were inquiring into and that 
they included everything and anything in their calcu- 
lations. Some confused suggestion with emotion or 
with error, others with docility or voluntary compli- 
ance, most of them confused it with the arousal of 
tendencies, or the association of ideas and their sta- 
tistics have no significance. It is exactly because they 
tried to hypnotize everybody and to cure no matter 
what by suggestion that they met with the many fail- 
ures that discouraged the sick and the physicians and 
brought on the decadence of hypnotism. If treatments 
by stimulation were better known there would like-
-P-A-G-E-263
  APPLICATIONS 255 
wise be a rush to apply them at random and veritable 
disaster would result. Every practical action demands 
a certain precision, and a psychological therapy is only 
possible when there is a psychological diagnosis. 
There is never anything absolute in a classification: 
diseases like living beings form a continuous series in 
which we establish divisions according to our needs. 
Every classification answers to certain practical needs: 
it unites groups of objects toward which we must be- 
have in the same way and separates objects toward 
which we should behave differently: classifications 
vary according to the type of behavior that we are 
considering. 
Classifications of the sick have generally been made 
from a scientific standpoint, that is to say from the 
point of view of student exposition, for pedagogic 
methods have played a considerable réle in the organ- 
ization of scientific systems which are originally meth- 
ods of instruction. Then classifications were made 
from the point of view of anatomy: a certain group 
of symptoms indicated that one would find a certain 
lesion at the autopsy. Next, classifications have been 
made from the point of view of microbiology: among 
patients of the same group one will find and make cul- 
tures of the same microbe. These various classifica- 
tions have rendered service to surgical and microbioligi- 
cal therapy. But they do not give any practical results 
when one tries to apply them to nervous and mental 
diseases and when one endeavors to apply psychologi- 
cal treatments. 
There is, however, a bit of psychological therapy
-P-A-G-E-264
  256 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
which plays a certain réle without one’s really being 
aware of it, namely, the singular division of nervous 
diseases into organic and functional diseases. From the 
scientific viewpoint this distinction has no meaning, 
and several times I have already had occasion to show 
that it is not admissible. There is no disease without 
some organic modification, large or small, known or un- 
known, lasting or temporary. But this distinction does 
exist, and it has an important bearing, which is that it 
has a significance from the viewpoint of psychological 
therapy. 
Psychology is the science of behavior and a psycho- 
logical therapy is a therapy that makes use of behavior, 
that is to say, of actions, of the functioning of organs. 
In psychotherapy we are always concerned with chang- 
ing actions, of diminishing them or of increasing them: 
a psychological therapy is always a functional therapy. 
To say that a disease is functional is to say that 
changes in the mode of its functioning may cure it and 
that the organic lesion that always exists is such that 
it can be cured by the transformation of the mode of 
functioning. To say that a disease is organic is to 
affirm, on the contrary, that the lesion of the organ 
will not be influenced by changes in the mode of 
functioning, and that consequently all psychotherapy 
is useless. This is the first psychotherapeutic diag- 
nosis. 
But after this first effort, medical analysis ordinarily 
halts, for to go farther would demand a study of psy- 
chology, and the physician is satisfied to apply a psy- 
chotherapy of one sort or another, as if all functional
-P-A-G-E-265
APPLICATIONS 257 
troubles were the same and as if all psychic influences 
were identical. Is it not reasonable to think that a 
more precise diagnosis would permit of much more 
certain applications? 
2. TREATMENTS OF FUNCTIONAL DEVIATIONS 
A group of functional disorders, once considered as 
very important, constitutes the disease of hysteria. 
This word is scarcely in fashion any longer; it has 
been discredited by the momentary recoil from hyp- 
notic studies, but it will return, for it has a good his- 
tory from the medical and psychological viewpoint and 
it has the advantage of not implying a venturesome 
hypothesis. It is true that the conception of hysteria 
still presents many difficulties, but we may at least 
agree to admit that it deals with a certain category of 
neuropaths and that this name is not applied indis- 
criminately to all psycho-neuroses. The diagnosis of 
hysteria, if not its psychological conception, is to-day 
a subject for instruction, and most physicians apply 
this name to the same patients. 
What I wrote in 1892 is now admitted, namely that 
most of the more apparent accidents result from “fixed 
ideas,” that is to say, from erroneous but fixed beliefs, 
developed by a psychic mechanism analogous to that 
of suggestion. This conception implies several serious 
assertions. It implicitly affirms that these patients 
do not lack the force to perform actions in a more cor- 
rect fashion, that they are not profoundly exhausted 
and that acute psychic asthenia is not involved. It 
also admits that the higher psychic tendencies are not 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  258 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
suppressed. The patients incapable of walking, of 
recovering a memory do not present in the same degree 
as so many other neuropaths, the aboulias, the doubts, 
the feelings of incompleteness so characteristic of 
more acute depressions. 
These two assertions are not quite correct and one 
should not allow oneself to go so far, which occurs too 
often, as to admit in hysteria only deviations by sug- 
gestion and to forget that we are dealing with a real 
disease. In hysteria there is both asthenia and psychic 
hypotonus, but this real depression is disguised by the 
phenomenon that I had described under the name of 
“psychic retraction” and that has since been presented 
again under the name of “repression.” Thanks to the 
reduction of the extent of activity, which is a kind of 
defensive reaction, the mind whose force and tension 
are diminished can create an illusion and simulate the 
real depression. It is precisely this lowering of tension, 
this diminution of reflection, joined to retraction that 
gives to suggestion its development and leads to fixed 
ideas. 
If this conception of deviation without asthenia or 
psychic hypotonus is exaggerated, it is, however, not 
without importance. The patient, thanks to these 
defense processes, suffers little from his depression and 
occupies himself more with troubles caused by this or 
that fixed idea. One can, when concerned with a real 
hysteric, leave aside, at least in part, the treatment of 
depression proper. In general one has to do with 
young subjects whose disease is only of some months 
standing and in whom there has not been the time
-P-A-G-E-267
  
APPLICATIONS 259 
to cause a profound and lasting depression. One’s 
main concern should be the correction of faulty func- 
tioning and it is in this situation that treatments by 
suggestion, by hypnotism, and by education, find their 
most interesting application. 
Suggestion consists in artificially causing, in the 
form of impulsion, the functioning of a tendency that 
the subject cannot obtain in the form of a personal 
will. In order that our appeal to lower tendencies 
may be understood, it is necessary that the subject 
should have in reserve, in spite of apparent paralysis, 
certain well-organized and heavily charged tendencies: 
he must possess a powerful system of automatic habits. 
It is not a question of fortifying the nervous and men- 
tal activity, of creating new resources, it is simply a 
question of making use of the resources that the sub- 
ject already possesses. The person who falls ill may 
be compared to an individual who comes to the point 
where he can no longer balance his budget and is about 
to go bankrupt. All at once he seems unable to meet 
the expenses of a certain number of operations, no 
matter how indispensable they may be. The physician 
is summoned to liquidate the situation and to reorgan- 
ize the budget. Treatment by suggestion does not 
change the life of the firm, it does not furnish the 
manager with new resources. The physician simply 
shows the subject that he has at hand some important 
resources that he had forgotten to make use of, and 
puts them at the disposition of the poor administrator 
who thought himself ruined when he was not. 
It is only too evident that the above is a partic-
-P-A-G-E-268
  260 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
ularly simple method for reorganizing involved finances 
and that unfortunately it is not applicable in every 
case. To be able to proceed thus one must be con- 
fronted with a ruin more apparent than real, one must 
have to do with financiers sufficiently naive to clamor 
about ruin when there is only disorder, and it is not 
likely that this will often happen. But it does occur 
sometimes because hysteria does exist. It is fortunate 
that the physician may on occasion know how to play 
this helpful and easy réle, the most simple method of 
psychotherapy. One must grant its interest, but one 
should not be surprised that it is too often inadequate 
and that one is almost always obliged to discover other 
less simple methods for restoring more seriously com- 
promised fortunes. 
The dangers that these treatments may involve have 
been greatly exaggerated, and I should be disposed to 
say that hypnotism and suggestion are unfortunately 
not dangerous enough. I say “unfortunately,” for a 
medication is not really powerful unless it can be 
dangerous and it is difficult to conceive of a therapy 
that may be at once efficacious and harmless in all 
cases. The dangerous character of a poison requires 
care in its application and doses, but it is also the first 
indication of the powerfulness of the medication. This 
is not at all the case in experimental suggestion and 
hypnotism which even badly applied do not so far 
appear able to cause serious trouble. The only con- 
clusion to draw from these observations is that sug- 
gestion should not be lightly undertaken, that it should 
not be dropped suddenly after the apparent cure of a
-P-A-G-E-269
APPLICATIONS 261 
single accident, that the patient and his family should 
be warned that beneath this accident there is a defec- 
tive mental state that cannot be instantly changed. 
There is an entire education to be undertaken here in 
which all kinds of therapeutic methods may be neces- 
sary. 
Although it may seem bizarre and even a little 
ridiculous, it is worth saying a few words here in regard 
to certain reproaches that have been directed at hyp- 
notic suggestion from an exclusively moral point of 
view. Several physicians, all at once seeing the light, 
have followed the example set by M. Dubois of Berne 
and have declared that this treatment, even if it were 
useful, should not be employed because it was humili- 
ating and dishonoring both for the patient and the 
physician. It does not seem to me very difficult to 
allay such delicate scruples. 
A certain number of these criticisms are connected 
with those previously described and have to do with 
the possible dangers of hypnotic suggestion and to 
these we have already replied. Déjerine adds that 
hypnotic suggestion is too powerful and that it could 
be employed for evil by an unscrupulous physician, 
since it is possible to cause crimes to be committed by 
suggestion. Supposing this were true, what medical 
or surgical treatment could withstand this criticism? 
Must arsenic be given up because of Lacenaire’s crime 
or the surgeons’ bistoury be dulled for fear lest they 
make use of it to cut their patients’ throats? 
The other criticisms are more directly moral; they 
are based on this singular idea that it is degrading to 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
    262 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
make use of the lower mental functions which lack 
dignity. It is not worth while here to answer such 
puerilities. Can we choose, can we appeal to the 
mental faculty that most pleases us? You always 
argue as though the patient were not sick and as 
though he could exercise any function whatsoever at 
will. If he had at his disposition this perfect reason- 
ing power and this ideal will of which you speak, he 
would not come to consult you. In reality he turns 
to you because he is not capable of behaving as a 
complete man, master of himself. “You can only cause 
him to carry on pseudo reasonings of which you have 
no right to be so proud.” It is much more proper 
not to attempt to deceive yourself and to occupy your- 
self directly with the lower functions that the patient 
still possesses, as is done elsewhere in all medical treat- 
ments which do not by any means always appeal to 
pure reason. As an American author said, “We no 
more suspend our judgment in permitting a physician 
to affirm for us a beneficial suggestion than we do in 
permitting him to introduce a dirty capsule into our 
bodies.” 
In all this discussion, which need not be prolonged, 
there is one misunderstanding: such problems are 
never raised in connection with other diseases and with 
other treatments. When a man goes to the physician 
with a syphilitic chancre, the latter does not enquire 
whether a sermon would be more noble and more moral 
than a mercury injection. The practitioner does not 
cover his face when he inserts his finger into the anus 
and he is not shocked when he puts a mirror into its 
   
-P-A-G-E-271
      
   APPLICATIONS 
opening: the patient is a sick man and ti 
duty is to care for him as soon as possible, t 
Such scruples only appear in psychotherapy 
it is not yet possible to avoid considering th .curo- 
path and the insane as ignorant disciples or as peni- 
tents who must be taught the fashionable truth or the 
morality of the hour. When it has been decided to 
consider them as really sick and when psychother- 
apists know how to be real physicians, these imaginary 
problems will no longer be remembered. 
In my work on “les médications psychologiques” I 
undertook an investigation that is much more impor- 
tant, to my notion, on the value of the treatment from 
a viewpoint that certainly has some interest, at least 
for the patients, namely that of the cure. I collected 
a great many records of neuropaths, 3500 in all, a great 
number of which cases had been followed up for years, 
and I tried to weigh with precision and severity the 
rdle that various psychological treatments had played 
in the evolution of the malady. In particular I inves- 
tigated the number of cases in which hypnotic sug- 
gestion, understood in a very exact fashion, had had a 
definitely beneficial effect and had been able to bring 
about distinct cures lasting for a year at least. It is 
true that such cases are not very frequent and I do 
not compare these statistics with those of the enthusi- 
astic healers of the heyday of hypnotism. But the ex- 
actitude that was used in the choice of these records 
gives them perhaps some value at a time when such 
treatments are contested and rarely used. 
I shall place in a first group some curious records in
-P-A-G-E-272
         PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
which the cure occurs so rapidly as to have an appear- 
ance of the so-called miraculous healings. In these 
records it is a question of serious, well-established 
affections of at least a month’s duration, various 
paralyses, contractions, choreas, mutisms, disorders of 
sight, etc., having, it is to be understood, the charac- 
teristics of the hysterical affections that we have just 
indicated. The treatment is begun immediately from 
the first visit without profound psychological analysis, 
simply by suggestion, understood in the sense that I 
have defined, either during the waking state or after 
rapid hypnotizing. The cure is obtained immediately 
or by several séances, four at the most, and it is lasting, 
for I count only those cases with no relapse during a 
year. I find in my notes only a small number of cases 
that can satisfy these severe conditions, but neverthe- 
less I count fifty-four of them that appear to me to be 
decisive. It seems to me that such records, for which, 
I repeat, analogies can be found in all the writings on 
hypnotic suggestion, justify the assertions so often 
made by the hypnotists and show that there is here a 
true healing power often manifesting itself in an abso- 
lutely remarkable way. 
In a second group I shall place the more numerous 
records in which the patients also arrive at a cure, 
apparently complete and lasting for at least a year, 
but in which the hypnotic treatments did not have an 
immediate miraculous result and had to be continued 
much longer. In most of these cases we are dealing 
with patients treated two or three times a week during 
a period that varied from one to three months. I do
-P-A-G-E-273
  APPLICATIONS 265 
not include in this group the patients who have been 
treated a longer time, because in this case the treat- 
ment appears to me to be modified by the addition 
of other influences. I am not going into a description 
of these various neuropathic disorders which are, more- 
over, analogous to the preceding ones. The accidents 
in the treatment, of which suggestion and hypnotism 
seem to me to have had an important rdle, are espe- 
cially hysterical attacks and particularly delirious at- 
tacks in a somnambulistic form. To-day it seems the 
fashion to question the existence and importance of 
such accidents. They are, however, quite frequent and 
often very serious: I have observed a great number of 
them. Among these records I put aside sixty-four 
cases in which the cure clearly seems to me to have 
been obtained by suggestion and hypnotic sleep. The 
latter is easily substituted for an hysterical attack and 
is much more easily handled by the operator, who, after 
having made use of hypnosis, can quite easily suppress 
it. The old magnetists had already noted facts of this 
nature: hypnotists have made like observations. “Far 
from manufacturing somnambulists by the hundred, 
as Calmeil thought,” Gilles de la Tourette tells us, 
“Magnetism, on the contrary, cures those who are af- 
fected by this neurosis. A curious thing is that arti- 
ficial somnambulism makes natural somnambulism dis- 
appear: with the result that one can be almost certain 
to cure a somnambulist of his nocturnal walks by 
hypnotizing him.”! This observation seems to be one 
of the most easily verifiable. The subjects who pre- 
*Gilles de la Tourette, L’hypnotisme, p. 173.
-P-A-G-E-274
266 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
sent delirious crises and natural somnambulisms, 
fugues followed by amnesia, are those who, in general, 
are the most easily hypnotized and are those who will 
derive the most benefit from this intervention. 
In a third and final group I shall place the records 
in which hypnotic suggestion has had only a tem- 
porary effect and never succeeded in obtaining a cure 
in less than a year. Nervous accidents like those in 
the first group always reappear after a longer or 
shorter interval. These records are very numerous, 
several hundred in all; it is useless to count them, 
since here they are of much less interest than the 
preceding ones. 
One should not, however, admit too quickly that 
in all the records of this group, treatments by hypnotic 
suggestion have not been of benefit to the patient. 
There are some records in which, without effecting a 
prolonged cure, these treatments have, however, ren- 
dered considerable service. 
In this connection ? I have for a long time made 
use of a remarkable record, that of Nov., a woman 
whom I first treated when she was twenty-six years 
old for hysterical contracture of the muscles of the 
trunk, causing that bent-over position that was de- 
scribed during the war among the plicaturés. For 
twenty years she continued to come for treatments, 
but only two or three times a year for the same con- 
tracture which reappeared in connection with fatigue 
or emotion. Each time a few minutes’ treatment was 
enough to send her away cured. Here was a very 
* Médications psychologiques, I, p. 382.
-P-A-G-E-275
  APPLICATIONS 267 
curious hysterical disease that for twenty years never 
changed and that always reproduced the same abdom- 
inal contracture of its first occurrence. It is an inter- 
esting example of psychic automatism. But the treat- 
ment is likewise worthy of notice: it is strictly a mental 
treatment. I use only a few words and a few signs and 
massage is only simulated. This treatment seems to 
me to be entirely by suggestion; it only involves a 
series of movements and actions that are easily and 
automatically performed, accompanied by my words 
and gestures, without the patient comprehending how 
the cure is being carried on and without her being able 
to reproduce it voluntarily. This treatment did not 
have a curative effect: there was never a complete 
cure lasting a whole year. One cannot say, however, 
that this treatment was useless to the patient nor that 
it was hard to apply. For twenty years it permitted 
Nov. to live at home and to work very hard without 
ever feeling her infirmity more than a few days at a 
time. When one considers that hysterical contractures 
can cause infirmities that last for years and sometimes 
a lifetime, one cannot deny that such treatments have 
rendered real service. 
To sum up, these statistics show us two hundred 
and fifty very clear cases in which such applications of 
treatment by an appeal to a system of automatic habits 
have had an incontestable value. It is to be under- 
stood, of course, that there is nothing surprising in 
these records, they only confirm those that have been 
published by a great number of authors, but they prove 
again the truth of those old studies. It is true that we
-P-A-G-E-276
  268 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
are here concerned, as we remarked at the beginning, 
with very special neuropathic diseases, among subjects 
who are generally young and not yet profoundly de- 
pressed. It is obvious from this that such treatments, 
useful only in particular cases, have a narrow appli- 
cation. Is this a reason for condemning them? Is one 
to grow indignant against the sulphur rub because it 
only cures the itch and would be disastrous for an 
eczema? Must injections of emetine which cure ame- 
bic dysentery and are not efficacious in bacterial dys- 
entery be derided? It is only fair to recognize the 
importance that hypnotism and suggestion have had 
in the history of medicine. Perhaps later on they will 
be transformed and forgotten, but the fact will, never- 
theless, remain that they have been the first precise 
psychological treatments, that they will have prepared 
the way for the discovery of all the others by forcing 
us to get away from indeterminate moralizations. This 
is a great merit which deserves recognition and the 
effort of so many investigators for more than a cen- 
tury will have been of some use to medical science. 
It is interesting to note that the conditions to which 
treatment by education can be applied are almost 
the same as the conditions for treatment by sugges- 
tion. Educational methods are successful with patients 
whose disorders are localized in this or that function 
over which the subject has lost control without there 
being a great general depression. One of the proofs 
of the beneficial results of education for neuroses is 
the ease with which we establish the effects of bad edu- 
cation. It is very ill-advised, under a pretext of avoid-
-P-A-G-E-277
APPLICATIONS 269 
ing fears and anxieties for the patient, to give in to 
all his manias and to permit him to carry out all his 
silly notions: very often one sees neuroses greatly 
aggravated by these concessions. Good education can 
be as powerful as bad. 
We have noted this good influence in many nervous 
troubles. It is clear that education must enter into 
the treatment of paralysis and neuropathic contrac- 
tures. The principal effect of the mobilization of forces 
and of massage seems to me to be an education of the 
subject who is brought to the conscious perception of 
muscular changes which he is too disposed to forget. 
Certain patients have to learn how to eat, drink, chew, 
swallow, take food into the stomach, breathe, talk, etc. 
I myself have had occasion to describe a curious patient 
who had lost one eye and who had had to learn to 
make use of the other single remaining eye by prac- 
ticing monocular vision instead of perpetually striving 
for the binocular vision that had become an impossi- 
bility.’ 
Even in the cases where other therapies are used at 
first, education is not without its usefulness: it enters 
in much later when the cure is already advanced, but 
it establishes the cure. Its essential rdle consists in 
transforming an action into an automatic tendency, in 
establishing it in some way. It is not enough to have 
once obtained a movement of the paralyzed member 
by some method or other and then to abandon the 
patient, for the paralysis or the contracture would soon 
be as complete as before. At this first moment the 
* Op. cit., III, p. 52.

movement must be repeated, simplified, caused to be 
produced more unconsciously, with less supervision and 
less effort. After having obtained the isolated action, 
the tendency must be reunited to the action and edu- 
cation always plays a considerable réle in this recon- 
struction. 
In a word we again come upon the problem of di- 
agnosis and the precise application of forms of medica- 
tion. We shall have to give up speaking about educa- 
tion in every connection when we are dealing with a 
neuropathic disorder. At some future time it will 
be necessary to distinguish with precision the symp- 
toms to which, and the patients to whom, education is 
applicable and the place that this special medication 
should occupy in the treatment. Then we shall see 
that education cannot be sufficient for everything, but 
that it will always retain one of the most important 
roles. 
3. TREATMENT OF PSYCHIC EXHAUSTION 
A much more considerable group is made up of 
asthenics who present an exhaustion of psychic forces. 
At the same time these patients almost always present 
a certain lowering of the psychic tension; but this low- 
ering is not extensive and above all it is not permanent, 
nor is it felt as painful and it does not demand direct 
treatment. It is the diminution of available forces 
that presents the chief problem. Under these condi- 
tions one can scarcely make use of the preceding 
methods. First of all the subjects who preserve their 
powers of reflection and have no very definite restric-
-P-A-G-E-279
APPLICATIONS 271 
tion of consciousness are not suggestible, at least in an 
experimental fashion, and next, which is the important 
point, the feebleness of the available forces reduces 
even the automatic functioning of tendencies and 
makes almost impossible an appeal to the group of 
automatic habits or to education. Under these con- 
ditions the various psycho-physiological treatments 
that endeavor to bring about disintoxication, the re- 
establishment of the digestive or circulatory functions, 
modifications in the secretions of the internal glands, 
the treatments that seek to regulate the functions of 
the sympathetic are evidently indispensable. I have 
considered such methods elsewhere while indicating 
that psychological medicine ought to be the most com- 
plete of all the therapies and that far from suppressing 
other methods it needs them all. Recently M. J. 
Laumonier, in his interesting book on “la théra- 
peutique des péchés capitaux’”’ 1922, shows very well 
the important réle that psycho-physiological therapy 
plays in the treatment of the passions themselves. But 
here we are dealing only with psychotherapy proper, 
and in asthenia the methods of psychic economy are 
the only ones that are useable and advantageous. But 
these methods of economy differ one from the other 
and answer to different situations. In order to apply 
them directly it is necessary to make the diagnosis 
definite and to discover the principal cause that deter- 
mines and maintains the exhaustion. 
A first case which is most interesting and permits 
of a relatively simple treatment is the one that we 
*Op. cit., III, p. 298. 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  272 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
studied under the name of neurosis by traumatic mem- 
ory. These individuals are brought to ruin because 
they maintain a certain expenditure outside the chan- 
nels of their ordinary life and this hidden expense is 
too considerable for their resources. This supplemen- 
tary expense results from an unadjusted business that 
the subject drags along with him indefinitely. He has 
kept some interest in a business which is not going 
well, which will never bring him in anything and which 
is daily costing him enormous sums. It is thus that 
we have understood traumatic memories and a great 
number of fixed ideas. The therapy is derived from 
this interpretation; the leak must be stopped: all the 
methods of moral disinfection have no other aim than 
to suppress the useless expense. Since the patient is 
not capable of doing it alone, he must be brought to 
adjust this old affair which is ruining him and the 
remaining revenues will be quite sufficient for the 
expenses of current life. 
The real difficulty that the use of this method pre- 
sents is the diagnosis of the traumatic memory and the 
demonstration that exhaustion is certainly due to an 
internal labor of this nature. There is first an evident 
exaggeration in connecting all these neuroses to mem- 
ories of exciting and badly adjusted sexual emotions. 
This may be true in a certain number of cases, no one 
disputes it, but it is impossible to turn this remark 
into a general rule. The sexual troubles that one notes 
are more often the consequences of a nervous disorder 
rather than the point of departure for it. It should 
not be forgotten that disorders of sexual conduct are
-P-A-G-E-281
  APPLICATIONS 273 
one of the most frequent manifestations of neuroses 
and one should avoid supposing too readily that such 
disorders have preceded the neuroses. 
It is equally dangerous always to locate in the sub- 
conscious of the patient exciting reminiscences, no trace 
of which appears in his consciousness. To my notion, 
one should distrust the subconscious. I was one of the 
first to describe this aspect that certain psychological 
facts can assume and to present this notion of the 
subconscious: I have not always been flattered in see- 
ing the development that it has undergone and its too 
splendid destiny. In the works of spiritualists and 
occultists the subconscious has become a marvelous 
principle of knowledge and action far beyond our poor 
thought; for the psychoanalysts it has become the 
principle of all the neuroses, the deus ex machina to 
which one appeals to explain everything. It does not 
seem to me that the subconscious merits such honor 
and I think that some precaution is needed to keep 
it in its place. A psychic phenomenon, which is al- 
ways in reality a certain mode of conduct in the 
patient, should always be verifiable by the observer. 
Phenomena separated from the subject’s normal con- 
sciousness manifest themselves besides in somnam- 
bulisms, writings, movements, automatic words, and it 
is fair to acknowledge them and to utilize them when 
one sees them. What one should avoid is the sub- 
conscious that one never sees and that one is limited 
to constructing according to fancy. The exaggerations 
that have disfigured excellent studies ought to teach 
us to distrust rapid interpretations that endeavor to
-P-A-G-E-282
274 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
find too quickly a support from psychological notions 
that are still very fragile. 
If men have been led on to place too many things 
in the subconscious, it is because it was necessary at 
all costs to recover in every neuropathic symptom a 
traumatic memory, a more or less deformed recollec- 
tion of a stirring event. Psychoanalysis is not an 
ordinary psychological analysis that attempts to dis- 
cover any phenomena whatsoever and the laws of these 
phenomena. It is a criminal investigation that must 
find a guilty party, a past event responsible for present 
troubles, which recognizes it and pursues it under all 
its disguises. One often finds, moreover, in the articles 
of this school, such comparisons of psychological study 
to a criminal investigation and of the psychiatrist to 
the detective. 
It is not at all certain that in every neurosis a psy- 
chic phenomenon of this sort necessarily plays an es- 
sential réle. Depression, like ruin, is not caused solely 
by excessive expense beyond the normal budget. One 
should not, however, when confronted by a poor 
wretch who has not a penny and who has never pos- 
sessed anything, gravely tell him that he is poor be- 
cause he is still maintaining an old mistress, or that 
he is secretly continuing to pay the expenses of a 
racing stable and that he has only to sell off his stable 
to get out of his misery. Misery, alas, often results 
from very other causes than wastefulness. Even in 
cases where the disease has started from a particular 
event and at the beginning has been connected with it, 
it may very well happen that the disease gradually
-P-A-G-E-283
  APPLICATIONS 275 
becomes independent of the event. Little by little the 
mind becomes exhausted in this fruitless struggle and 
even if now it has ceased to struggle, it remains none 
the less exhausted. To take up again our financial 
comparison, an individual has little by little ruined 
himself because, unknown to every one, he was sup- 
porting a mistress outside his own household and the 
time comes when, even were one to put an end to this 
drain, the ruin is no less complete. 
One can very well admit, moreover, that exhaustion 
often does not depend on a past reminiscence, but 
that it results from actual events that recur every day. 
More often still the subject’s depression which has 
existed since infancy depends on his inherited consti- 
tution, on the period of life through which he is pass- 
ing, on physical diseases, on diverse intoxications that 
he has had to bear, on a gradual exhaustion brought 
on by a host of slight repeated fatigues or even little 
emotions, each one insignificant in itself, which have 
left no distinct or dangerous memories. The symp- 
toms and the fixed ideas that the subject. presents in 
these cases are determined by the depth of the depres- 
sion, by its localization in this or that function orig- 
inally weak or enfeebled by a succession of slight for- 
gotten shocks. They are also determined by reactions 
peculiar to the subject, by his temperament, his intel- 
ligence, his education, etc. In cases of this sort, this 
or that event in his life has no great importance and 
all the investigations of the detective into the patient’s 
past will have little of interest, at least from the thera- 
peutic point of view. 
   
-P-A-G-E-284
  276 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
Such reflections determined at the beginning of my 
studies very special precautions in the study and dis- 
covery of traumatic memories. The discovery of such 
memories being important for the interpretation and 
for the treatment of certain neuroses, it was neces- 
sary to make every effort to discover them when they 
existed; but since it was understood that such mem- 
ories might very well be absent, it was likewise neces- 
sary to make every effort not to discover them when 
they did not exist. If this is the way we understand it, 
then traumatic memory plays an important réle in a 
certain number of neuroses and psychoses. Between 
those who never concern themselves with traumatic 
memory and even ignore its existence and those who 
imagine it everywhere, it would be fair to place those 
who admit it in determined cases. For these, certain 
rules of diagnosis should be established; unfortunately 
these psychological facts are still poorly established 
and it is difficult to give precise information. 
First information can be given by a kind of elim- 
ination: a depression that seems to be accidental, that 
is not connected with the subject’s state since his 
youth, that does not depend on a visible alteration in 
his health, may be connected with facts of this nature. 
I believe it important to eliminate also the causes for 
exhaustion that the subject’s situation may furnish, 
his habitual surroundings and among these, social in- 
fluences, as we have seen, are the most important. It 
is when one finds no explanations in the actual life 
of the patient that it is justifiable to seek into his 
past life.
-P-A-G-E-285
  APPLICATIONS 277 
I cannot side unreservedly with certain critics who 
fear thus to draw the subject’s attention to the details 
of his life and to fixed ideas. Evidently there have 
been absurd exaggerations on this point that have alto- 
gether compromised these studies. But exaggeration 
is as bad in one sense as in another. It is as much 
as to say that the surgeon should never touch a wound 
for fear of soiling and infecting it; everyone knows 
that he must touch it but touch it properly. If the 
physician is not convinced in advance that he is going 
to find one event responsible for all the disease and 
if he does not stubbornly demand that this event be 
of a sexual order, he will be able to make this exam- 
ination with tact and without unduly troubling the 
patient. 
A study of the patient’s early life is indispensable, 
and it ought to be made with the subject himself, for 
we need to note the memories that he possesses of 
such and such a period, the fashion in which he de- 
scribes them, the degree to which he has assimilated 
them. Often the patient himself draws our attention to 
the concern that he maintains in regard to this or that 
epoch in his life. On the other hand, the moment the 
symptoms appear, their rapid or gradual appearance 
after some event or other, certain symptoms that are 
always connected with a special fact can put us on the 
track. More or less complete amnesias in regard to 
certain epochs or certain facts, deliriums, hallucina- 
tions, phobias, reveries, emotions that occur as soon 
as one draws attention to such points, confirm these 
suspicions. If one uncovers a memory of this nature
-P-A-G-E-286
  278 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
one must next take account of the réle that it may 
still be playing to-day. Many events have been pain- 
ful during the course of a lifetime, have left a more 
or less moving memory that in reality plays no part 
in it now. One should consider as traumatic only such 
memories as are now frequently recurring, such mem- 
ories as cause constant and easily observed effort and 
are capable of determining exhaustion. 
When this diagnosis has been well done, the methods 
for bringing to light subconscious memories, their re- 
integration into consciousness, the dissociation of cer- 
tain groups of memories, whether during hypnosis, or 
in other psychic states, and especially the various 
methods of liquidation, often have remarkable results. 
It would be easy to count a considerable number of 
patients of various sorts who have been relieved, whose 
crises have been shortened by this moral disinfection. 
In many cases when we are dealing with youthful 
patients, if an adjustment takes place in time, before 
the depression becomes too profound and definite, the 
cure and the reconstruction of forces may be complete 
and more than one patient has not had any other crisis 
for years. 
If one does not stubbornly reduce all patients to 
the same type and explain all weaknesses by trau- 
matic memories, he will find himself confronted by 
psychic exhaustions whose causes are different. Many 
patients are exhausted, not by the memory of some 
former adventure, but by the difficulties of a daily 
life that is too complicated for their psychic power
-P-A-G-E-287
APPLICATIONS 279 
and that presents at every turn too many obstacles 
on which they are “stuck.” 
The first step in their treatment consists in suppress- 
ing the continual efforts caused by this “getting 
stuck.” It is necessary to “disentangle” the patients, 
that is to say, to solve as far as possible the complex sit- 
uations in which they find themselves and in which 
they are involved. In certain cases, the simplest ones, 
we must ourselves perform the acts that change the ex- 
ternal circumstances and that bring about the solution 
that the patient needs. We must assume responsibili- 
ties, formulate decisions, make the necessary efforts and 
confront the patient with the solved problem. False 
situations should be disposed of in this fashion and it 
is surprising how many mental diseases of an appar- 
ently serious nature disappear as soon as it has been 
possible to put an end to a delicate and difficult situ- 
ation. 
In other cases the “disentanglement” is more difficult 
because we cannot ourselves perform all the acts that 
solve the problem: it is necessary to make the patient 
perform some of them himself. For example, when it 
is a question of one of those young persons made ill 
by a proposal of marriage and who for months exhausts 
herself by superhuman efforts to arrive at a “yes” or a 
“no,” the physician must, after an examination of the 
situation, not only make the decision, but he must 
make the patient accept it and herself pronounce the 
decisive word. When the marriage has been accom- 
plished, the physician should maintain it or dissolve 
it, but he should make the subject act accordingly.
-P-A-G-E-288
    280 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
There is involved here a capital problem for the alien- 
ist, that of securing the performance of an action both 
important and advantageous for his patient. 
Finally, psychological analysis clearly shows us that 
the most complicated acts are social, that the expendi- 
tures demanded by adaptation to the individuals that 
surround us are much the greatest. It results from 
this that such expenditures are the ones to be restricted 
and avoided. 
We have already remarked in a preceding chapter 
that the phobias of neuropaths are sometimes signs of 
necessary precautions. Now it is evident that among 
a great number of these neuropaths there are devel- 
oped thoroughly characteristic timidities and social 
phobias. According as the depression increases, they 
display an increasing fear of living with those who 
surround them and express the desire to get away and 
they almost all end by building up a dream of a “desert 
island.” There is evidently something morbid in this, 
an exaggeration of social aboulia, but there is also an 
indication of the exhaustion that society, and espe- 
cially a certain society, is causing them. 
The essential feature of a sanatorium is that it 
should furnish the patient with an artificial social en- 
vironment in which the psychic expenditures for social 
adaptation may be reduced to a minimum. The small 
number of persons, always the same, with whom the 
patient has to deal, the absolute uniformity of the 
life, the suppression of rivalries, of useless orders, of 
the claims of affection, of the demands for consider- 
ation and the social amenities, realize as far as possible
-P-A-G-E-289
  APPLICATIONS 281 
this simplification of social life. These characteristics 
of treatment by isolation must be well understood in 
order to make such hospitals as efficacious as possible. 
There have been many attempts to effect a half 
isolation for the mentally weak by placing them in 
surroundings that are just as simple but less artificial 
than those of real hospitals. The attempts that have 
been made at Gheel in Belgium, at Dun-sur-Auron, at 
Aunay-le-Ch&teau in France, at placing patients with 
families in the country are among the most interest- 
ing. Unfortunately these endeavors are more con- 
cerned with demented patients whom one is content 
to keep within bounds. Such treatments ought rather 
to be organized for curable neuropaths whom it would 
be necessary, as someone has said, “to transport far 
from the noise of the city, the turmoil of business, far 
from telephones and tramways” and I should add, far 
from their families, their enemies and their friends. 
Convents formerly furnished such patients with the 
retreats that they needed. If it is possible that con- 
vents may have engendered cases of insanity, they pre- 
vented and cured many others that would have devel- 
oped in a life in the outside world. Perhaps, as some- 
one says, the next century will see the development of 
lay convents which will serve our successors as tem- 
porary asylums for restoring their forces, calming their 
nerves, retempering their wills for the struggles of the 
coming year. 
Very often, happily, it is not necessary to demand 
such radical changes of environment. Exact knowl- 
edge of the expenditures demanded by social life under
-P-A-G-E-290
  282 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
one condition or another, with one individual or an- 
other, makes it possible in quite a number of cases to 
preserve the essential advantages of isolation without 
taking the patient completely out of his environment. 
The simple restriction of social relations, the very im- 
portant distinction between costly neighbors and cheap 
neighbors, makes possible the avoidance of complete 
isolation and the reduction of social expenditures to 
the dimensions of the scanty budget. I have thought 
it wise to recommend solitude from time to time to 
many of these persons. It should not be thought that 
man, and especially the exhausted man, has constant 
need of being watched, cared for, distracted, by the 
friends who surround him. Nothing is so restful, or 
affords so much relaxation and true distraction, as a 
few hours of solitude. Many patients feel that they 
have need of these few hours of solitude every day in 
order to behave normally with other persons during 
the remainder of the day and in order to cause the 
disappearance of the feeling of emptiness in the head. 
This remedy, which is more often useful than one 
might think, should not be forgotten. 
But it is even more important to endeavor to sim- 
plify the family life of the weak, their everyday social 
life in their habitual environment. I have attempted 
to show that neuropaths or the candidates for a neu- 
rosis use themselves up in their daily contacts with 
their relatives, whether because the latter, being more 
active, drag them into too worldly a life, too compli- 
cated for their feeble forces, or whether they present 
more or less costly and difficult characteristics. Dr.

Morton Prince formerly showed that treatment by 
isolation consists precisely in taking patients away 
from their homes, in separating them from the mem- 
bers of their family. It seems to me worth while to be 
more explicit by saying that separation from all the 
members of their family is not indispensable, but that 
one must discriminate and more or less definitely sep- 
arate them from this or that person who may be par- 
ticularly dangerous to them. 
It is often very important to simplify the group by 
counseling certain persons to withdraw from it. Even 
when children are not married, but have grown up, 
they cannot always remain with their parents when 
there is some individual in the family afflicted with a 
neurosis and capable of developing an aboulia and 
growing to be teasing, domineering, irritable, and tor- 
mented. A certain separation revives affections instead 
of destroying them. 
When such separations cannot be brought about or 
when they are not indispensable, the psychiatric physi- 
cian should not give up all action, he should try to 
reorganize the life of the group. Some interesting 
studies have been written on the “maladjustments of 
the family.” Occasionally a reduction of the number 
of hours spent in the house reduces friction, “often the 
trouble is that one spends too much time at home 
crowded with others.” Often it is beneficial to intro- 
duce a new member into the family to serve as a buffer 
between the various elements. All sorts of details 
ought to be observed because they have a great impor- 
tance when one wishes to attempt the reduction to a 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  284 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
minimum of fruitless efforts and the causes of exhaus- 
tion. 
It is not always difficult to reorganize communal 
life when one has gained some authority over the 
group. But one must take account of one thing that 
is ordinarily little known, which is that in order to 
treat a neuropath in his family it is almost always 
necessary to treat several other persons at the same 
time. This is not easy, for such persons do not consider 
themselves at all ill and represent their greatest ab- 
surdities as legitimate acts connected with sacred rights 
or as acts of magnificent devotion. To struggle against 
the domineering manias of some and against the manias 
of devotion of the others is evidently more complicated 
than to give a prescription for a bromide, but it is an 
essential and very fruitful part of psychotherapy. 
Then there is a final group, the most important, 
perhaps, from the medical viewpoint, that of the acute 
asthenias whose actual psychological causes are not 
perceptible. Profound exhaustion results from a defec- 
tive constitution, from varied or little known phys- 
iological disorders, from excessive work, from a false 
situation that has been borne for a long time and from 
many other causes about which we know little. Ex- 
haustion manifests itself by enormous fluctuations in 
force and psychic tension on the occasion of the slight- 
est expenditure, by the temporary impotence of this 
or that psychic function, by failures of walking, speech, 
memory or feeling. “I cannot love God any more than 
I can love my own kin.” One might say that these

patients pass in review all the symptomatology of men- 
tal disease: sometimes they assume the aspect of mel- 
ancholia, sometimes of hypomania, sometimes of psy- 
chasthenia with obsessions and doubts, sometimes of 
hysteria. In certain cases they have some conscious- 
ness of their exhaustion and of “the emptiness of their 
vertebral column, of their brain.’ In other cases they 
present that curious inversion of the feeling of fatigue 
that has recently been well described. They have then 
a singular need for movement, occupation, work, and 
at first they profess to suffer from rest more than from 
excitement. Disorders attack the physiological func- 
tions, the digestion, the respiration, especially the cir- 
culation, and seem sometimes to be connected with 
changes in the secretions of the internal glands, some- 
times with alterations in the functions of the sympa- 
thetic and the vagus. A great many diseases which 
appear to be physical and are insufficiently explained 
are connected with this permanent or periodic exhaus- 
tion that often remains unrecognized. 
The diagnosis of this form of exhaustion is not with- 
out importance for psychotherapy, for it is in this form 
that suggestion, education, psycho-analytical investi- 
gations should be entirely avoided, for they are useless 
and generally dangerous. The greatest physical and 
moral repose, greatly prolonged, the most complete 
isolation possible are indispensable if one wishes to 
avoid acute mental accidents that are, more often than 
one thinks, the consequence of these psychic exhaus- 
tions when they continue too long unrecognized. 
It is not enough in these difficult treatments simply
-P-A-G-E-294
  286 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
to keep the patient in bed for a long time; his life 
and behavior in bed must be minutely regulated. It 
is in attempting to direct such patients that we note 
with astonishment our ignorance of the organization 
of the psychic budget. We should know exactly what 
each action costs and how its price varies according 
to the subject’s state. We should know how to take 
precautions in the choice of persons who come in to 
the patient’s room and the time when they may enter; 
we should always take into account whether the acts 
that we cause to be performed are new or old and 
should permit only those activities to which the sub- 
ject is thoroughly accustomed. The slightest change 
in the surroundings in which the action takes place, 
even in the appearance of the room, modifies the 
facility of the action. We should know how to pre- 
pare long in advance for any activity that is some- 
what novel and how to suppress entirely anything, 
whether close at hand or distant, that might resemble 
a surprise, etc. The science of psychic life is scarcely 
begun. 
It is impossible to enumerate the cases of all kinds 
in which treatment of this nature has brought about 
acure. It is true that there must be an understanding 
of the word cure: it is simply a question of the sup- 
pression of neuropathic disorders in connection with 
psychic bankruptcy or an asthenic crisis proper. Most 
frequently such patients retain for a long time, if not 
forever, a noticeable psychic weakness and they cannot 
go beyond a minimum figure of expenditure without 
risk of new accidents. The psychologist physician
-P-A-G-E-295
APPLICATIONS 287 
should organize their life with regard to their moder- 
ate resources. “You have made me understand that 
I must lead a somewhat restricted life and I have come 
to believe that you are right. I cannot extend the 
scope of my life for then I can no longer guard my- 
self and I lose control of myself. I am forced to 
a strict economy of my forces.” It should be added 
that this patient has thus for years avoided crises of 
depression with delirium which were repeated over 
and over and which had already brought him to the 
asylum. 
It is regrettable, of course, to deprive the patient of 
the joys of life, to forbid him its triumphs, its enthusi- 
asms, its passionate interests, but this is often very 
useful and in general easy, for such patients are un- 
happy persons who almost always remain at least in 
a first degree of depression and are accustomed to a 
colorless life. According to the example of the patient 
Paul whose precautions we have described, they must 
avoid festivals, ceremonies, frequent gatherings. Only 
a few patients will resist. These are the ones who 
desperately pursue, as by an impulsive obsession, joys 
and passionate interests. It will be necessary to show 
them constantly the dangers that such joys hold for 
them and to keep them in check as far as possible. 
It will be said that it is impossible to avoid occasions 
for grief, surprise, regret, but this is not at all true. 
One can avoid the circumstances that expose us to rup- 
tures, deceptions; one can avoid taking things too 
much to heart and can make much less frequent the 
occasions that demand a triumph or an adjustment and
-P-A-G-E-296
  288 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
less frequent also the occasions for a traumatic 
memory. 
4, TREATMENT OF PSYCHIC HYPOTENSION 
The conditions in which it is useful to apply treat- 
ment by stimulation are very little known and very 
hard to determine. These forms of treatment demand 
from the patient attention, work and effort. The sub- 
jects must have some resources in themselves if they 
are to be capable of being aroused, stirred, excited. 
Many persons are not capable of this and it is under- 
stood that these methods do not succeed with every- 
one. The physicians who formerly had recourse to 
metallotherapy complained of subjects who did not 
know how to make any effort to recover or to main- 
tain their sensitivity. All those who have tried to 
make depressed patients work have made the same 
complaint of their lack of zeal. It seems odd to cure 
exhausted individuals by making them work and to 
avoid bankruptcy by advising new expense. We have 
seen that this is not entirely unintelligible, but it is 
no less clear that great caution is necessary in these 
forms of speculation and that the patients who are 
advised effort and work must be chosen with discrim- 
ination. 
In the presence of a neuropath whose symptoms are 
quite diverse, should the physician order rest or work, 
the economy of strength or a speculative outlay? Un- 
fortunately this is a very hard problem and psycho- 
therapists usually seem not to suspect its importance. 
If I am not mistaken the physician usually orders com-
-P-A-G-E-297
  
  APPLICATIONS 289 
plete rest for the patient or distraction by occupation 
according to his own doctrinal preferences and without 
any serious psychological diagnosis to justify his 
choice. Some of them repeat in all cases: “stop work, 
give up your business, stretch out on an easy chair 
and take refuge in a hospital.” Others always urge: 
“avoid this inertia, which will ruin you; walk, go out, 
work, amuse yourself, sursum corda!” A day will 
come when one prescription or the other will no longer 
be made at random, but will be the conclusion of a 
serious psychological analysis. Unfortunately we are 
still far from that ideal and shall long remain in the 
period of vague directions and groping. cos 
In a general and theoretic fashion the stimulating 
treatments apply to patients whose disorders are re- 
lated to a lowering of the psychic tension rather than 
to the diminution of force, to patients who present 
psychic hypotonus rather than asthenia proper. But 
this is a systematic formula that canrot guide practice 
at all. To be somewhat more precise we may add 
to this: these patients can be recognized first by nega- 
tive characteristics, the absence or the rarity of the 
physical and moral signs of asthenia, of visceral dis- 
orders, of weakness, of the complete temporary impo- 
tence of certain functions whose importance we have 
noted. In the second place the disorders consist in 
changes in initiative, in forms of laziness, in doubts, 
in aboulias of a special form. There are involved 
disorders of higher tendencies, moral effort, work, and 
reflection. It is in this connection that we see those 
paradoxes of excitement to which I have already called
-P-A-G-E-298
  290 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
attention: the diseases, the real enfeeblement that 
increase the true asthenias on the contrary diminish 
disorders of this sort, while the increase of strength 
aggravates them. Obsessions, phobias, pains, manias, 
impulsions of every kind, behave like the forms of ex- 
citement that increase when strength is increased. Dis- 
orders seem to depend on the loss of that equilibrium 
which should exist between force and psychic tension. 
Unfortunately all these signs are hard to verify and 
quite open to error. It will usually be necessary to 
trust to experimentation and feeling the way. I think 
it is generally good to start the treatment of depres- 
sion by using the methods of economy and rest, and 
these should never be completely abandoned, because 
it is rest that economizes the forces of which stimula- 
tion can dispose. It is then only by degrees that vari- 
ous attempts at stimulation through activity can be 
added to the repose. These are continued, increased or 
diminished according to their case, according to their 
results, according to the manner in which stimulation 
is borne. 
When the conditions favorable to stimulation seem 
to be present, different forms of stimulating treatment 
are employed according to the circumstances. Certain 
physical methods of treatment are often beneficial. 
Here there arises the problem of the use of the toxic 
stimulants that should be considered purely as medi- 
cines. I cannot go over again here all the discussion 
of this and mention only its conclusion, which is that 
it would be wrong to condemn such use entirely when 
it is moderate and carefully supervised. Moreover,
-P-A-G-E-299
  APPLICATIONS 291 
stimulants like alcohol and opium will be less danger- 
ous if there is added the use of strictly psychological 
stimulants such as are pointed out in several psycho- 
therapeutic methods. 
These methods, zsthesiogeny as well as stimulation 
by work, always consist in making the patient act, in 
determining in him an activity. A new problem is 
raised, in connection with a new diagnosis: what action 
should be chosen? 
Certain patients already have impulsions that drive 
them toward some stimulating activity or other. The 
physician ought first to study and regulate these im- 
pulsions, which almost always involve or have involved 
some useful stimulation, but which have altered in a 
dangerous way through abuse. It is of course neces- 
sary to suppress the activities that are dangerous for 
the patient from the social or hygienic point of view. 
It is equally necessary to fight against the impulsions 
that I would describe as mistaken, in which the patient 
seeks a stimulation that they cannot give him. On 
the other hand it is often right to save, in part at least, 
certain impulsions toward the pursuit of love, of domi- 
nation, of success, etc., which are not absurd in their 
principle. The patient is getting no more good effect 
from them, first, because he is awkward and does not 
succeed in getting what he wants, and, second, because 
he repeats the act too often when the exhausted ten- 
dency can no longer be completely activated. The 
physician’s part is to regulate these impulsions rather 
than suppress them. As we have seen, that which 
chiefly constitutes the danger of impulsions is their
-P-A-G-E-300
  292 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
restricted character, their exclusiveness. In place of 
seeking stimulation in a single act always the same, 
stimulation must be sought in various activities bor- 
rowed from various tendencies, which allows success 
in more cases and at less expense. Instructions of this 
sort succeed oftener than one would think in trans- 
forming pathological impulsions into instruments of 
cure. We often have to deal with depressed patients 
who have no impulsions, and the physician’s part is 
sometimes to work to create them. It is necessary 
to point out to them activities that they are capable 
of accomplishing and that do them some good, and it 
is necessary to teach them to perform these correctly 
and completely in a fashion that can render them 
stimulating. 
When most disorders are caused by the absence or 
the inadequacy of a certain activity, as is the case 
in traumatic memories and “getting stuck,” it is clear 
that it is this act that it is particularly important to 
bring about. 
Much oftener, the inadequate acts are more numer- 
ous, and occur more frequently. It is not precisely 
a question of causing an act to be performed once for 
all, but of restoring a tendency and teaching the sub- 
ject to perform regularly acts of a certain nature. 
Among patients with phobias, for example, the 
anxieties that seem to supervene in specific conditions 
are usually the result of the inadequacy of the acts 
that should be performed in these circumstances. In 
certain cases it is a question of restoring psychic ten- 
dencies related to some physiological function, diet and
-P-A-G-E-301
APPLICATIONS 293 
respiration, for example. In others it is necessary to 
restore social acts, for social aboulia plays a large part 
in a number of phobias, in agoraphobias, ereuthopho- 
bias, and the numberless forms of pathologic timidity. 
Sometimes patients’ troubles indicate the arrest of an 
intellectual function, of a certain category of percep- 
tions, of beliefs, of reasoning, and here again the activ- 
ity that must be sought seems definite enough. 
Still more often this is not the situation. The 
depression bears on the whole mind and the carrying 
out of one particular action does not seem much more 
important than that of another. It would be a mis- 
take to look for, something that pleases these subjects 
or interests them because their disease consists exactly 
in that they can take interest in nothing. Interest is 
a form of the activity of tendencies; it is already a 
degree of activation, and tension must be already 
raised for there to be interest. 
Our sole concern then, when we are choosing the 
activity that is to become a source of stimulation, is a 
concern for convenience. It is natural to look first 
for the activity that is easiest to secure, that which 
will most easily procure the. subject a success under 
the circumstances in which he finds himself placed. 
The simplest of these actions consist of simple move- 
ments of members which the patient can execute with- 
out having to speak and without having to concern 
himself with the persons about him. Dressing, house- 
keeping, clothes, walking, bicycling, gardening, car- 
pentry, etc., are of this sort. 
Much more important exercises, whose stimulat-
-P-A-G-E-302
  294 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
ing effect can be much more intense, are those acts 
where speech plays a part. It is often very helpful 
to force certain patients to speak clearly on any sub- 
ject. When they are much depressed there is only 
one subject of which they can talk, that is, themselves 
and their sufferings. Although it may seem odd and 
even sometimes dangerous, it seems to me often useful 
to let the patient talk a great deal about himself and 
to lead him to express his fears and his obsessions, of 
course avoiding too much talk. All that need be de- 
manded is that this expression of ideas be made with 
the greatest possible clearness and distinctness. 
An exercise of an opposite sort can be associated 
with this to advantage: the patient who tells his trou- 
bles to the physician and who learns to tell them 
completely and in an intelligible manner should at the 
same time avoid talking at random to everyone as he 
has been doing. This is an effort to keep silence before 
the members of the family, as beneficial for them as 
for the patient. When a patient with an obsession can 
reach the point of keeping his confidences for the 
doctor and pretending a cure before others he has 
made an enormous step forward. 
The two foregoing modes of behavior seem to me 
to put into practice a tendency that remained latent 
in patients of this kind, the tendency to confide in a 
definite person. Such patients, indeed, need to con- 
fide in some one, but do not actually reach the point of 
confiding. They are communicative and reserved at 
the same time. They talk at random of certain obses- 
sive ideas and they are very secretive concerning their
-P-A-G-E-303
  APPLICATIONS 295 
real feelings and their real concerns. In the majority 
of cases it is very useful to lead them to show them- 
selves for what they are. We can connect with this 
task a group of other activities equally difficult, but 
whose effects are very interesting, and consist in the 
consciousness and the expression of feelings. Neuro- 
paths are in general considered sensitive and emotional, 
because they tend to show, in season and out of season, 
apparently a great deal of emotional divigation, but it 
should not be concluded that their feelings are actually 
always true and profound. To demand that the sub- 
ject stop humbug and mockery when he expresses a 
feeling, that he continue, that he allow it to develop 
completely, that he be angry or that he really weep 
if he desires, all this is doubtless a delicate operation 
that can be performed only in very special cireum- 
stances, but it is one that gives very interesting results 
oftener than is believed. 
We may call intellectual exercises those in which 
efforts at attention, representation, and comparison 
play a part. In patients of cultivated minds these are 
activities that are quite easy to organize and direct 
and that, though they may be less potent than the 
material or social acts, are nevertheless very effec- 
tive. 
There is not time to dwell longer on the nature of 
the acts that can serve as a start for stimulation, for 
the essential thing is not the content of the act, but 
the way in which the act is carried out. Acts of quite 
the same appearance have shown themselves of no 
significance, or have been the starting point for severe
-P-A-G-E-304
  296 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
depressions, or have served as stimulants and raised 
psychic tension for a long time. 
It is necessary, as we have seen in studying the 
principle of stimulation, that the act arrive at its last 
term, that “it be physically, socially, psychologically 
finished.” To bring about a stimulation of the sub- 
ject it is first necessary to bring it to pass that the 
act is finished in a material sense, in such a way that 
a distinct change of objects or situation is apparent. 
This is a difficulty already, for we are concerned with 
patients who never finish and who often stop their 
activity before reaching an apparent conclusion. Suc- 
cess is an essential element of this treatment by action. 
In many cases social success will be marked by the 
attitude of witnesses, by their congratulations, by an- 
swers to letters, by all kinds of tangible proofs. It is 
harder to establish the psychological perfection of the 
act. The feelings that the subject expresses in this 
connection must be inferred. This is why it is neces- 
sary to see to it that the act is performed consciously 
and that the subject take account of what he is doing. 
The feelings of incompleteness that usually accompany 
his acts must be seen to disappear and the opposite 
feelings seen to appear in their place, feelings of the 
actual, of unity, of freedom, and especially the feeling 
of satisfaction and of pleasure that is an important 
characteristic of the completed act. 
To secure activity of this kind it is necessary to take 
into account a certain number of conditions. The 
favorable moment must first be chosen; the patient 
often needs a preliminary rest in entire peace. In
-P-A-G-E-305
APPLICATIONS 297 
many cases a long preparation is necessary, because 
one of the essential characteristics of such pathological 
activity is sluggishness. Very often when these de- 
pressed patients do not succeed themselves in accom- 
plishing the useful actions that would relieve them, 
it is because under the normal conditions of life they 
never succeed in acting quickly enough. The rapid 
shifting of circumstances, and above all the ordinary 
rhythm of social life, only rarely allows them time 
enough to act. The doctor takes them aside, isolates 
them from other circumstances and other persons; he 
keeps off the thought of other problems and forces the 
patient to define the difficulties that arrest his mind, 
but above all he keeps the patient’s thought for a 
long time on the same action and gives him time 
really to will it. 
Treatments by stimulation are not always applicable. 
Not only in too feeble patients, but also in pussillani- 
mous subjects, whose will is poor or has been rendered 
so by the disease, and in those who are too quickly 
excited or dangerously exhausted, these methods of 
treatment give only negligible results. There are pa- 
tients for whom such stimulation has been possible 
and useful for a certain time, and who relapse after 
some years more profoundly and definitely. I have 
in this connection demonstrated some experiments that 
allow this relapse to be predicted in progressive psy- 
chasthenic dementias. 
There are, however, a number of cases in which 
these unfavorable conditions are not present and in 
which there is an interesting improvement. The effect
-P-A-G-E-306
  298 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
of such stimulation is sometimes manifested during 
the interview itself. The patients arrive at the begin- 
ning of the visit depressed, groaning, dissatisfied with 
themselves and with others. After some effort of will 
and attention many of them change to such an extent 
as to be unrecognizable. In spite of a certain fatigue 
they enter into a period of euphoria that quite deserves 
to be called a period of influence. 
These patients, more or less rid of their obsessions, 
have regained will and attention; they have become 
capable of action, of adapting themselves to social con- 
ditions and even of doing useful work. They are 
happy, and they express their happiness with remark- 
able enthusiasm. “I am living with more zest; I find 
time for everything, and I am in tune;.. . to the 
utter amazement of everyone I am growing definite, I 
am getting back my personality . . . it seems to me 
that I am taking part in a renascence of my life.” 
We find odd feelings of seeing more clearly, of finding 
the daylight more brilliant, of beginning another life. 
This happy period does not last indefinitely, at least 
if the subjects involved are not at the limit of their 
disease. At the end of a variable and unfortunately 
usually very short time “a fog settles on their head 
again,” their energetic activity disappears, and the 
usual folly begins again. 
These curious fluctuations are very important from 
the psychological viewpoint; they make it possible to 
study changes of tension under the influence of work 
and fatigue, under the influence of emotion which is 
sometimes stimulating and sometimes depressing; they
-P-A-G-E-307
  APPLICATIONS 299 
offer a curious explanation of religious times of dryness 
and times of blessedness: from the medical point of 
view they are invaluable for indicating the laws of 
recovery in patients. 
A certain number of depressed patients can be re- 
lieved, whether by the methods of esthesiogeny, when 
their application is possible, or by other forms of 
stimulation. Psychasthenic states with obsessions last- 
ing for years can be transformed; attacks of depression 
can be much shortened. The coincidence of mental 
improvement with trials of these therapeutic methods 
is often very interesting. In the psychological treat- 
ment by esthesiogeny and stimulation there is a whole 
therapy which is, no doubt, in its infancy, and is still 
difficult to apply, but which, in different cases, com- 
plements the forms of treatment by habit formation 
and by economy of force.
-P-A-G-E-308
  CHAPTER II 
PSYCHOTHERAPY 
All these forms of education, these forms of guid- 
ance, these various methods of treatment by sugges- 
tion or by stimulation have often been joined under 
the same heading, Psychotherapy. The notion of psy-__ 
chotherapy is as yet very vague; it is not eas 
‘understand its meaning or to judge of its importance. 
A first group of definitions. considers psychotherapy 
the treatment of disorders of the mind. This is clearly 
one of the ends of psychotherapy, but it is first one. 
sary to extend the conception of mental disorders and 
to understand thoroughly that it is not simply a ques- 
tion of mental alienation proper, but of all the alter- 
ations of behavior, whatever they may be, and, more- 
over, it must not be forgotten that many authors talk 
of psychotherapy in connection with diseases .of the 
stomach, enteritis, bladder disorders, which may be 
connected with mental. disorders, but which are not, 
properly speaking, disorders of the mind. These defi. 
nitions apply rather to the word “psychiatry,” which 
must not be confused with the word “psychotherapy.” 
The majority of the other definitions do not consider 
the mind as the object of psychotherapy, but as the 
means that it employs and define it by the use that it 
300 
   
-P-A-G-E-309
  PSYCHOTHERAPY 301 
makes of certain definite phenomena. As Grasset aptly 
said: “Electrotherapy and hydrotherapy are not treat- 
ments of electricity or water, but treatments by elec- 
tricity and by water; psychotherapy is not a treatment 
of the mind, but by the mind.” It is to this con- 
ception that the majority of the most commonly 
admitted definitions of psychotherapy reduce. 
I should be well enough disposed to accept one of 
these formulas. if I did not have certain scruples, and 
if I did not fear that these definitions might be still 
somewhat restricted. They seem to admit that the 
therapeutic activity of the physician should provoke 
psychological phenomena simply and directly; they 
seem to exclude the processes that seem partly physical 
and that have an indirect action on morale. In speak- 
ing of psycho-physiological treatment I recalled the 
experiments of Moreau of Tours on hashish, treat- 
ments with alcohol, with opium, or simply with cathar- 
tics, the therapeutic methods that attempt to alter the 
internal secretions or the functions of the sympathetic, 
etc., etc.... I have maintained that it would be wrong 
not to allow them the right to admission into psycho- 
therapy. In our efforts to change a man’s behavior 
we cannot make a radical division between what is 
physical and what is mental. Our advice is given by 
means of words which involve physical phenomena 
just as a man’s behavior involves movements as well 
as ideas. The doctor who, in order to put a suggestion 
into effect, has the patient swallow bread pills, or cap- 
sules of methylene blue, or who uses electricity, is 
mixing physical acts with his moral treatment. Changes
-P-A-G-E-310
  
302 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
of routine, cathartics, sedative or stimulating sub- 
stances have both a physical and a mental action. 
From a more general point of view there is a ques- 
tion whether it is possible to make an exact division 
between physiological and psychological functions. 
“Neuropathic disorders,” as I demonstrated in my book 
on psychological medicine, “are the expression of the 
activity of the whole organism, its growth, its evolu- 
tion, its involution. The organs and the functions 
that take part in these phenomena are not well under- 
stood, their disorders are scarcely suspected, but they 
exist and must be given more and more study. Psy- 
chology is not independent of physiology, but it de- 
mands a more delicate and more profound physiology 
than that of the digestion or of the respiration. The 
study of nervous and mental diseases, far from being 
able to do without physiological and medical informa- 
tion, will more and more demand a much more thor- 
ough physiology and medicine. The treatment of these 
diseases, far from being possible after brief medical 
study, will fall to the most accomplished clinician and 
will require the use of all forms of examination and all 
the most delicate methods.? 
Should treatments of this kind still be included 
under the head of psychotherapy? It seems to me 
that they should for several reasons. In the first place, 
the very application of such forms of treatment will 
require psychological knowledge and methods based on 
psychological laws. In ordinary diseases that do not 
disturb behavior it is enough to give the patient advice, 
*Op. cit., III, p. 299. 
 
-P-A-G-E-311
  PSYCHOTHERAPY 303 
a prescription: “have this operation . . . follow this 
diet . . . take this medicine. .. .” There is a question 
whether it is enough to behave in the same way with 
a neuropathic patient, to tell an hysterical anorexic 
to eat more, and a psychasthenic who has impulsions 
to overeat, to eat less. It is not enough for such 
patients to give them advice or to correct a fault. 
Patients who have disorders of intelligence, belief, or 
will must be made to understand such advice, made 
to accept it, made to carry it out. This is something 
very different, and the treatment remains for the most 
part a problem of psychology. 
But there is more to be said; the very diagnosis of 
such delicate disorders of the organism, the choice of 
treatments, the understanding of the effects of treat- 
ment, cannot be effected except through psychological 
studies and by virtue of psychological methods. To 
understand such disorders of the organism’s evolution, 
it will always be necessary to recognize the phenomena 
and the degrees of depression, to study the stimulation 
brought about by certain methods of treatment, to 
recognize it and distinguish it from excitement, which 
is always difficult, and so on . . . and all this requires 
psychological investigation. 
Actually, it is the sciences that are divided and not 
the objects; psychology is a discipline distinct from 
physiology and therapeutic methods are divided ac- 
cording as they demand more of one or of the other. 
What distinguishes two methods of treatment is the 
reasons that have determined their choice. A thera- 
peutic method is chemical because the medicines that
-P-A-G-E-312
  304 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
it prescribes are chosen in accordance with our knowl- 
edge of chemistry; a therapeutic method is physical 
because the methods it recommends are an application 
of the teaching of physical science. One practices psy- 
chotherapy every time he applies the laws of psychol- 
ogy. If I give a cathartic to a patient simply because 
I have in mind the action of the cathartic on the fibres 
of the intestine I am practicing a physiological ther- 
apy; if I give the same cathartic to a patient affected 
by mental confusion because a large number of studies 
have shown a constant relationship between the intoxi- 
cations and psychic disorders of this kind, because I 
hope by getting rid of the intoxication to make the 
patient’s thought more lucid, I am practicing psycho- 
therapy. 
I would thus come to propose the following defini- 
tion: psychotherapy is a group of therapeutic processes 
of all sorts, physical as well as mental, applicable also 
to physical as well as mental diseases, these processes 
determined by the consideration of psychological facts 
previously observed, and, above all, by the consider- 
ation of the laws that rule the development of these 
psychological facts and their association either with 
each other or with physiological facts. In a word, psy- 
chotherapy is an application of psychological science 
to the treatment of diseases. 
1. THE EVOLUTION OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
For a long time psychotherapy has been practiced 
in a manner that may be called unconscious or at least 
irrational. It played a large part in miraculous forms
-P-A-G-E-313
  
PSYCHOTHERAPY 305 
of treatment and in the forms of religious and moral 
influence, but the effects that were recorded were not 
connected with their real cause. 
‘In the last century psychotherapy seems to have 
become conscious of itself. The renascence of hypno- 
tism had aroused great enthusiasm: “The mind is not 
a negligible quantity,’ M. Bernheim had said, “there 
is a psycho-biology; there is also a psycho-therapy; it 
is a great lever, this human mind, and the physician- 
healer should make use of this lever.’)/Many physicians, 
like Dr. A. T. Myers in 1893, added: “Nascitur ars 
nova medendi; we must work, not through the stomach 
or through the blood, but through thought. We must 
penetrate farther into the patient and enlist all his 
most secret forces.” Hypnotism and suggestion, after 
the struggle against the school of Charcot, no doubt 
went through a period of decadence, but mental ther- 
apy had not disappeared, it had only changed its name 
somewhat; it offered itself in the form of treatment 
by reasoning and persuasion. The medical moraliza- 
tion of M. Dubois of Berne, the Emmanuel movement 
and the “new thought movement” in America, the 
isolation and rest treatments, the methods grouped 
under the name of psychoanalysis are only some devel- 
opments of the same beliefs under different names. 
Again, at the beginning of the present century, we 
saw spring up in every country and every language, 
especially in the English-speaking countries, an enor- 
mous literature on this new means for comforting suf- 
fering humanity. / To take only one example, in the

founded, like that of Dr. Morton Prince at Tufts Col- 
lege Medical School at Boston, numerous lectures were 
given everywhere on these topics, revues and all kinds 
of works were specially devoted to such studies. I 
have already called attention to the importance of a 
half-scientific, half-popular literature in America; I 
have mentioned the publications of the New Thought 
Company, the great work of popularization, “Psycho- 
therapy” published by Parker in three quarto volumes 
that appeared in New York in 1909 and in which there 
collaborated a large number of professors of neurology 
and of psychiatry, philosophers and psychologists, as 
well as the representatives of various religions. It was 
evident that the old animal magnetism movement, hyp- 
notism, and we must not forget the “Christian science” 
of Mrs. Eddy, had won the great public. These were 
the circumstances under which my lessons on psycho- 
therapy given in Boston in 1904 and at the Collége de 
France in 1907 attempted to offer some contribution 
to a collection of interesting studies. 
Nevertheless, if I am not mistaken, this movement 
has slackened pace to-day, and there is a decrease in 
studies on psychotherapy proper, just as there was in 
-1895 a falling off in the enthusiasm provoked by hyp- 
notism. These fluctuations in certain difficult and 
intensely interesting studies occur always and in- 
evitably in all scientific fields: they are the result of 
disillusionment following on excessive enthusiasm. 
“Psychotherapy has not given all that was expected 
of it any more than has hypnotism. If it were really 
powerful it should, it would seem, furnish numerous
-P-A-G-E-315
  
PSYCHOTHERAPY 307 
and definite methods of treatment, pointing out exactly 
their effects and the very definite moral or physical 
changes that follow their use / This is what many 
manuals of physical therapy do’when they tell us about 
medicines that are soothing, soporific, cathartic, alter- 
ative, etc.; the physician can choose according to the 
case and his needs. Nothing of this sort exists in psy- 
chotherapy and some even pretend that all classifica- 
tion of this sort is impossible “because the treatment 
is personal and simply varies with each individual who 
applies it.” This is much exaggerated; the originality 
of each psychotherapist is usually only apparent and 
his treatment need not be thought new because he 
calls it by a new word. But it is certain that, since 
these treatments are understood and described in a 
very vague way, it is hard to see the relations they 
bear one to the other. A therapy based on laws should 
first of all tell us the conditions in which this or that 
form of treatment should be used and show us con- 
cisely where each treatment is indicated. Directions 
of this kind are still more rare in psychotherapy. The 
names and diagnoses of psychological disorders are 
very vague and are entirely given over to the tyranny 
of sectarian conventions. As for real psychothera- 
peutic diagnosis which should be indispensable, we 
have seen that it scarcely exists. 
It is true that psychotherapy seems to have some 
general efficacy, as we have remarked in discussing its 
applications, but, in practical applications to special 
cases, it does not furnish the certainty or even the 
probability that holds in a number of surgical or med-
-P-A-G-E-316
  308 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
ical therapies,/ "We have no right to hold the inad- 
equacies of their methods against the psychotherapists: 
they do no more than apply a science and the inade- 
quacies of its application only demonstrate the 
inadequacies of the science of psychology itself. 
Discouragement would be still more unfortunate 
than the excessive enthusiasm of the beginning; along 
with defects it is easy to verify real progress. Medi- 
cine has applied to the relief of human misery all the 
discoveries of science, even the most incomplete, and 
it was ready to make immediate use of the notion of a 
natural law even when science had scarcely begun to 
suspect that there was such a thing. Psychotherapy 
was ready to turn to account some of the innumerable 
observations of the moralists who demonstrated a cer- 
tain relationship between some changes in physical or 
moral health and the appearance of certain phenomena 
in the mind. The first attempts at psychotherapy 
had a very general and a very vague character: relying 
on some observations that were generally very indefi- 
nite, they tried to match against any physical or moral 
disorders whatsoever, not well defined, psychological 
phenomena equally vague and indefinite. This was 
the essential characteristic of the first therapies, 
religious, philosophical, and moral. 
A somewhat more precise knowledge of some psycho- 
logical facts and laws gave rise to attempts at a more 
scientific psychotherapy. Studies of tendencies, of 
psychic reflexes, of the various psychic automatisms 
permitted the use of the various forms of suggestion 
that sought to bring about automatically the function-
-P-A-G-E-317
  RG e PSYCHOTHERAPY 309 
ing of this or that tendency. The result of this is that 
hypnotic suggestion is no longer a vague theriac that 
cannot be discussed. It is a definite treatment with a 
restricted field of application, one which can be ap- 
proved or disapproved, which can be advised more or 
less often, and of which the results are established. 
If I am not mistaken such characteristics are extremely 
important; they lead us out of the religious and moral 
period and into the properly scientific period of psycho- 
therapy. 
Notions concerning fatigue, concerning exhaustion, 
concerning the depression that follows the expense of 
excessive activity have lead to a therapy by the econ- 
omy of mental force, whether the object was to do 
away with some expense related to certain memories, 
certain annoying tendencies, by means of the disin- 
fection of the mind, or whether the object was to 
limit the expense of life by the suppression of move- 
ments and acts, by isolation and the restriction of 
social life. The examination of the transformations 
that can be brought about in young children by educa- 
tion gave rise to a host of treatments by gymnastic 
or reéducation. Finally, the much more hypothetical 
conceptions aimed at the interpretation of the charac- 
teristic changes of waking, of effort, of attention, the 
marvelous increases in strength that confidence, faith, 
enthusiasm seem to cause, allowed us to foresee the 
efficacy of treatments by stimulation. 
It seems to me very hard to attribute to pure chance 
all these improvements and all the cures, even, that 
have been excellently described in the numerous studies 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
ee 
310 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
on psychotherapy. I have myself dwelt sufficiently 
on the numerous records where the efficient action of 
this or that process of treatment could not be doubted 
in the least. From this time on psychotherapy under- 
stood in the broad sense, including all the processes of 
treatment determined by the knowledge of psycho- 
logical or physio-psychological laws, certainly rendered 
obvious service in a large number of cases. 
2. THE PROGRESS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
To understand the value of these efforts and the 
results that they promise for the future, certain of 
our conceptions of mental diseases and of psychological 
science must be a little altered. 
At the beginning of the study of insanity mental 
diseases were too much isolated; they were built on 
the model of diseases with anatomical lesions: an inde- 
pendent and definite existence and a rigid evolution 
were attributed to them. We understand better to-day 
that we are not dealing with special diseases, inde- 
pendent of others, but that we have to deal with par- 
ticular manifestations of all the other diseases of the 
organism, with an expression of the organism’s defects 
and of all the disturbances of its vital evolution. 
The distribution of these diseases into fixed lists, 
statements about their regular and fatal evolution 
seem to me still more rash than all the dreams of the 
most enthusiastic psychotherapists. Except in some 
last stages where there can be seen a certain regularity, 
| clinical observation shows us an astonishing variability 
| and a disconcerting irregularity in diseases of the mind.  
-P-A-G-E-319
PSYCHOTHERAPY 311 
Physiological and psychological disorders undergo in- 
cessant transformation under all sorts of physical and 
moral influences, and it is hard even to enumerate 
the countless phenomena that cause the mental level 
of the sick to rise and fall like a cartesian diver. 
This being the case, how can it be asserted a priori that 
only chance events can have a beneficial effect and 
that our selected and planned practices will not have 
a like success? That would be to deny in advance all 
discoveries and all the practical application of science. 
There is a tendency to believe that mental diseases 
are terrible and quite hopeless calamities that overtake 
certain individuals in a clear and definite but fortu- 
nately exceptional manner. The ideas of the public 
on this point are like those it used to hold concerning 
tuberculosis, which was known only under the terrible 
but rare form of phthisis. It is now understood that 
there are mild, curable, but widely distributed forms 
of tuberculosis. The same will be true for mental dis- 
orders; it will be recognized that, under various forms, 
more or less mild, they exist to-day everywhere in a 
mass of individuals who are not ordinarily considered 
sick. There will come an increasing understanding of 
the fact that the types of mental diseases that we rec- 
ognize as true insanities are only different stages of a 
disorder that has undergone all sorts of evolution and 
of which the first seeds were found in disorders of 
character. 
It will be easy to verify that the development of 
the more severe forms will be arrested by dealing with 
the first stages of psychic impairment. The majority
-P-A-G-E-320
  312 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
of mental diseases are in a high proportion curable 
during their early phases. We must cease to think 
of mental patients as exceptional cases, distinct from 
others, who need only be confined in special asylums. 
This is the last remnant of the prejudices concerning 
insanity that were believed to be destroyed at the 
time of Pinel, Esquirol and William Tuke, but that 
have remained alive in our conception of special asy- 
lums for the insane. These diseases should be more 
and more dealt with in the ordinary hospitals and 
dispensaries, like other diseases. Free consultations 
which are beginning to be organized in various coun- 
tries and which scarcely exist in France will allow the 
first symptoms to be ferreted out and a true mental 
prophylaxis organized. 
“The conception of our science of psychology, more- 
over, is being gradually changed by the attempts to 
put it to practice. The first attempts at psychotherapy 
have aroused psychology and rudely called it back to 
the issue’ The evolution of human knowledge rarely 
follows a logical path: the applications that should be 
derived from theory and science precede them and 
often direct them. It is the needs of therapeutic appli- 
cation that are to-day forcing psychology to enter into 
the study that is proper to it, the description and the 
scientific explanation of human conduct. Exact studies 
on the details of such conduct, on the need for love, on 
jealousy, on timidity, etc., which once seemed to be 
insignificant accessories, or literary supplements to true 
psychology, should be considered the essential of a 
truly. practical and useful psychology. The search for
-P-A-G-E-321
  PSYCHOTHERAPY 313 
laws relating to variations of mood, to degrees of activ- 
ity, to forms of emotion, ought not to be left to the 
novelists, but should be in the foreground of the psy- 
chologists’ concerns, because it is precisely on these 
laws that all psychotherapy must be based. Medicine 
has made a sudden appeal to psychology and has asked 
it to render services for which it was not at all pre- 
pared. It has been shown inadequate for its task and 
this is what has cast discredit on psychotherapy itself. 
But this failure has forced it to undertake new studies 
from entirely different points of view, and this has 
brought about its entire regeneration. 
An important study that psychology considered with 
a certain repugnance is introduced forcibly, so to speak, 
through clinical and therapeutic needs. Psychology, 
which had divorced itself from metaphysics, was sus- 
picious of speculation concerning forces and the degrees 
of forces. It had rejected the faculty doctrine in fear 
of appearing indulgent toward ancient speculation con- 
cerning inner powers. Disease, however, immediately 
presents us with enfeeblement, reinforcements, fluctu- 
ations of tension connected with all the tendencies, and 
one cannot treat a neuropath if one is not willing to 
take account of these fundamental problems. 
As I said at the end of my work on psychological 
medicine: “Psychology is obliged to take up the prob- 
lem of the economic administration of the mind’s 
forces. It is probable that we shall one day know how 
to establish the balance and the budget of a mind as 
we establish those of a business firm. /At that time 
the psychiatric physician will be able’ to make good
-P-A-G-E-322
314 PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 
use of slender resources by avoiding useless expense 
and by directing effort to just the necessary point: 
he will do better; he will teach his patients to increase 
their resources and enrich their minds. I hope that 
the present work will not have been entirely useless 
to those who will one day discover the rules of this 
good administration of psychic funds.”

  INTRODUCTION 
THE Gary PLan 
In the last few years both laymen and professional 
educators have engaged in a lively controversy as to the 
merits and defects, advantages and disadvantages of 
what has come to be called the Gary idea or the Gary 
plan. The rapidly increasing literature bearing on the 
subject is, however, deficient in details and too often 
partisan in tone. The present study was undertaken 
by the General Education Board at the request of the 
Gary school authorities for the purpose of presenting an 
accurate and comprehensive account of the Gary schools 
in their significant aspects. 
In the several volumes in which the main features of 
the Gary schools are separately considered, the reader 
will observe that, after presenting facts, each of the 
authors discusses or—in technical phrase—attempts to 
evaluate the Gary plan from the angle of his particular 
interest. Facts were gathered in a patient, painstaking, 
and objective fashion; and those who want facts, and 
facts only, will, it is believed, find them in the descriptive 
and statistical portions of the respective studies. But 
the successive volumes will discuss principles, as well as

state facts. That is, the authors will not only describe 
the Gary schools in the frankest manner, as they found 
them, but they will also endeavor to interpret them in the 
light of the large educational movement of which they 
are part. An educational conception may be sound or 
unsound; any particular effort to embody an educa- 
tional conception may be adequate or inadequate, effec- 
tive or ineffective. The public is interested in knowing 
whether the Gary schools as now conducted are efficient 
or inefficient; the public is also interested in knowing 
whether the plan as such is sound or unsound. The 
present study tries to do justice to both points. 
What is the Gary plan? 
Perhaps, in the first instance, the essential features of 
the Gary plan can be made clear, if, instead of trying to 
tell what the Gary plan is, we tell what it is not. Ex- 
cept for its recent origin and the unusual situation as 
respects its foreign population, Gary ‘resembles many 
other industrial centers that are to be found throughout 
the country. Now, had Gary provided itself with the 
type of school commonly found in other small industrial 
American towns, we should find there half a dozen or 
more square brick “soap-box” buildings, each accom- 
modating a dozen classes pursuing the usual book studies, 
a playground, with little or no equipment, perhaps a 
basement room for manual training, a laboratory, and a 
cooking room for the girls. Had Gary played safe, this 
is the sort of school and school equipment that it would 
now possess. Provided with this conventional school

system, the town would have led a conventional school 
life—quiet, unoffending, and negatively happy—doing 
as many others do, doing it about as well as they do it 
and satisfied to do just that. 
As contrasted with education of this meager type, the 
Gary plan is distinguished by two features, intimately 
connected with each other: 
First—the enrichment and diversification of the 
curriculum; 
Second—the administrative device that, for want of a 
better name, will be tentatively termed the duplicate 
school organization. 
These two features must first be considered in general 
terms, if the reader is to understand the detailed descrip- 
tion and discussion. ; 
As to the curriculum and school activities. While 
the practice of education has in large part continued 
to follow traditional paths, the progressive literature of 
the subject has abounded in constructive suggestions 
of far-reaching practical significance. Social, political, 
and industrial changes have forced upon the school 
responsibilities formerly laid upon the home. Once the 
school had mainly to teach the elements of knowledge; 
now the school is charged with the physical, mental, and 
social training of the child. To meet these needs a 
changed and enriched curriculum, including community 
activities, facilities for recreation, shop work, and house- 
hold arts, has been urged on the content side of school 
work; the transformation of school aims and discipline

was offered by other towns of the Gary type, could have 
been matched by what was to be found in many of the 
better favored larger towns and cities at the same period. 
The gymnasium, for example, was not more than one 
third its present size; the industrial work was not un- 
precedented in kind or extent; the boys had woodwork, 
the girls cooking and sewing. But progress was rapid: 
painting and printing were added in 1911; the foundry, 
forge, and machine shop in 1913. ‘The opportunities 
for girls were enlarged by the addition of the cafeteria in 
1913. The auditorium reached its present extended use 
as recently as the school year 1913-14. The Froebel 
school, first occupied in the fall of 1912, started with 
facilities similar to those previously introduced piecemeal 
into the Emerson. 
These facilities, covering in their development a period 
of years, represent the effort to create an elementary 
school more nearly adequate to the needs of modern 
urban life. The curriculum is enriched by various ac- 
tivities in the fields of industry, science, and recreation. 
Questions as to the efficiency with which these varied 
activities have been administered will be discussed by 
the various contributors to the present study. Mean- 
while, it is perhaps only fair to point out that the modern 
movement calls not only for additions to, but elimina- 
tions from, the curriculum and for a critical attitude 
toward the products of classroom teaching. How far, on 
the academic side, the Gary schools reflect this aspect 
of the modern movement will also presently appear.
-P-A-G-E-14
xii INTRODUCTION 
The administrative device—the “duplicate” organiza- 
tion, noted above as the second characteristic feature of 
the Gary plan—stands on a somewhat different footing, 
as the following considerations make plain. 
Once more, Mr. Wirt was not the inventor of the in- 
tensive use of school buildings, though he was among the 
first—if not the very first—to perceive the purely educa- 
tional advantage to which the situation could be turned. 
The rapidity with which American cities have grown has 
created a difficult problem for school administrators— 
the problem of providing space and instruction for chil- 
dren who increase in number faster than buildings are 
constructed. The problem has been handled in various 
ways. In one place, the regular school day has been 
shortened and two different sets of children attending at 
different hours have been taught daily in one building 
and by one group of teachers. Elsewhere, as in certain 
high schools, a complete double session has been con- 
ducted. ‘The use of one set of schoolrooms for more than 
one set of children each day did not therefore originate 
at Gary. 
Another point needs to be considered before we discuss 
the so-called duplicate feature of the Gary plan. In 
American colleges, subjects have commonly been taught 
by specialists, not by class teachers. The work is “de- 
partmentalized”’—to use the technical term. There is 
a teacher of Latin, a teacher of mathematics, a teacher 
of physics, who together instruct every class—not a 
separate teacher of each class in all subjects. Latterly,

INTRODUCTION xiii 
departmentalization has spread from the college into 
the high school, until nowadays well organized high 
schools and the upper grades of elementary schools are 
quite generally “departmentalized,” i.e., organized with 
special teachers for the several subjects, rather than 
with one teacher for each grade. 
Out of these two elements, Gary has evolved an admin- 
istrative device, the so-called duplicate school, which, 
from the standpoint of its present educational signifi- 
cance, does indeed represent a definite innovation. 
For the sake of clearness, it will be well to explain the 
theory of the duplicate school by a simplified imaginary 
example: 
Let us suppose that elementary school facilities have 
to be provided for, say, 1,600 children. If each class is 
to contain a maximum of 40 children, a schoolhouse of 
40 rooms would formerly have been built, with perhaps 
a few additional rooms, little used, for special activities; 
except during the recess (12 to 1:30) each recitation 
room would be in practically continuous use in the old- 
line subjects from 9 to 3:30, when school is adjourned till 
next morning. A school plant of this kind may be 
represented by Figure I, each square representing a 
schoolroom. 
The “duplicate” school proposes a different solution. 
Instead of providing 4o classrooms for 40 classes, it 
requires 20 classrooms, capable of holding 800 children; 
and further, playgrounds, laboratories, shops, gardens, 
gymnasium, and auditorium, also capable of holding 
   
-P-A-G-E-18
  ‘xiv INTRODUCTION 
800 children. If, now, 800 children use the classrooms 
while 800 are using the other facilities, morning and after- 
noon, the entire plant accommodates 1,600 pupils 
throughout the school day; and the curriculum is greatly 
enriched, since, without taking away anything from their 
classroom work, they are getting other branches also. A 
school thus equipped and organized may be represented 
FIGURE I 
REPRESENTS OLD-FASHIONED SCHOOLHOUSE 
40 rooms for 40 classes, of 40 children each, i. e., facilities for the academic instruc- 
tion of 1,600 children. A school yard and an extra room or two, little used, for special 
activities, are also usually found. 
  by Figure II, in which A represents 20 classes taking 
care of 40 children each (800 children), and B represents 
special facilities taking care of 800 children. As A 
and B are in simultaneous operation, 1,600 children are 
cared for. 
This method of visualizing the “duplicate” school 
serves to correct a common misconception. The plan 
aims to intensify the use of schoolrooms; yet it would be
-P-A-G-E-19
    INTRODUCTION xv 
incorrect to say that 20 classrooms, instead of 40, 
as under the old plan, accommodate 1,600 children. 
For while the number of classrooms has been reduced 
from 40 to 20, special facilities of equal capacity have 
been added in the form of auditorium, shops, play- 
ground, etc. The 20 classrooms apparently saved

have been replaced by special facilities of one kind or 
another. The so-called duplicate organization and 
the longer school day make it possible to give larger 
facilities to twice as many children as the classrooms alone 
would accommodate. The duplicate school, as devel- 
oped at Gary, is not therefore a device to relieve conges- 
tion or to reduce expense, but the natural result of 
efforts to provide a richer school life for all children.
-P-A-G-E-20
  xvi INTRODUCTION 
The enriched curriculum and the duplicate organ- 
ization support each other. The social situation re- 
quires a scheme of education fairly adequate to the 
entire scope of the child’s activities and possibilities; 
this cannot be achieved without a longer school day and 
a more varied school equipment. The duplicate school 
endeavors to give the longer day, the richer curriculum, 
and the more varied activities with the lowest possible 
investment in, and the most intensive use of, the school 
plant. The so-called duplicate school is thus a single 
school with two different types of facilities in more or less 
constant and simultaneous operation, morning and 
afternoon. 
Such is the Gary plan in conception. What about the 
execution? Is it realized at Gary? Does it work? 
What is involved as respects space, investment, etc., 
when ordinary classrooms are replaced by shops, play- 
grounds, and laboratories? Can a given equipment in 
the way of auditorium, shops, etc., handle precisely 
the same number of children accommodated in the class- 
rooms without doing violence to their educational needs 
on the one hand, and without waste through temporary 
disuse of the special facilities, on the other? To what 
extent has Gary modified or reorganized on modern lines 
the treatment of the common classroom subjects? How 
efficient is instruction in the usual academic studies as 
well as in the newer or so-called modern subjects and 
activities? Is the plan economical in the sense that 
equal educational advantages cannot be procured by
-P-A-G-E-21
    INTRODUCTION xvii 
any other scheme except at greater cost? These and 
other questions as to the execution of the Gary plan are, 
as far as data were obtainable, discussed in the separate 
volumes making up the present survey. 
The concrete questions above mentioned do not, how- 
ever, exhaust the educational values of a given school 
situation. From every school system there come im- 
ponderable products, bad as well as good. Aside from 
all else, many observers of the Gary schools report one 
such imponderable in the form of a spiritual something 
which can hardly be included in a study of administra- 
tion and eludes the testing of classroom work. These 
observers have no way of knowing whether Gary school 
costs are high or low; whether the pupils spell and add as 
well as children do elsewhere; but, however these things 
may be, they usually describe the pupils as characterized 
by self-possession, resourcefulness, and happiness to an 
unusual degree. While different schools and indeed 
different parts of the same school vary in this respect, 
the members of the survey staff agree that, on the whole, 
there is a basis of fact for these observations. Gary is 
thus something more than a school organization charac- 
terized by the two main features above discussed. 
The reason is not far to seek. Innovation is stimu- 
lating, just as conformity is deadening. Experiment 
is in this sense a thing wholesome in itself. Of course 
it must be held to strict accountability for results; and 
this study is the work of persons who, convinced of the 
necessity of educational progress, are at the same time
-P-A-G-E-22
  xviii INTRODUCTION 
solicitous that the outcome be carefully observed. 
The fact that customary school procedure does not rest 
upon a scientific basis, does not willingly submit itself 
to thorough scrutiny, is no reason for exempting educa- 
tional innovations from strict accountability. The very 
reverse is indeed true; for otherwise innovation may im- 
peril or sacrifice essential educational values, without 
actually knowing whether or not it has achieved definite 
values of its own. Faith in a new program does not 
absolve the reformer from a watchful and critical atti- 
tude toward results. Moreover, if the innovator for- 
mulates his purposes in definite terms and measures his 
results in the light of his professed aims, the conservative 
cannot permanently escape the same process. Gary, like 
all other educational experiments, must be held account- 
able in this fashion. Subject however to such ac- 
countability, the breaking of the conventional school 
framework, the introduction of new subject matter or 
equipment, even administrative reorganization, at Gary as 
elsewhere, tend to favor a fresher, more vigorous interest 
and spirit. Defects will in the following pages be pointed 
out in the Gary schools—defects of organization, of ad- 
ministration, of instruction. But there is for the reasons 
just suggested something in the Gary schools over and 
above the Gary plan. Problems abound, as in every 
living and developing situation. But the problems 
are the problems of life, and, as such, are in the long 
run perhaps more hopeful than the relatively smooth 
functioning of a stationary school system. ‘Thus, not-

withstanding the defects and shortcomings which this 
study will candidly point out, the experiment at Gary 
rightly observed and interpreted is both interesting and 
stimulating.

I. PRESENT DAY PROBLEMS 
ment arises in large measure, from the effort at 
Gary to deal with some of the pressing problems 
of public education. It is well, therefore, before de- 
scribing the organization and administration of the Gary 
schools to review briefly the main problems with which 
boards of education and superintendents are now con- 
fronted. The more important of these may be stated 
as follows: 
(1) How may the elementary curriculum be mod- 
ernized so as to provide adequately for: 
(a) The intellectual, moral, social, and industrial 
demands of a democratic society? 
(b) Individual differences in physical endow- ° 
ment, mental ability, interests, and vocational out- 
look? 
(2) How may schools with modernized programs be 
organized so as to procure a maximum of teaching effi- 
ciency? 
(3) Can schools be provided with the buildings, 
the facilities, and the teachers required by a modern 
program and be maintained with such funds as an Ameri- 
can municipality will furnish? 
3 Pree inhereat in Gary’s educational experi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  4 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Let us consider briefly the situation in respect to each 
of these problems. 
MODERNIZING THE CURRICULUM 
At bottom, the problems above mentioned revolve 
about modernization of the school program. A lively 
discussion is in progress among both teachers and lay- 
men on this subject. Such terms as ‘‘a modern school,” 
“a modern curriculum” are in common use. It is im- 
portant to point out, however, that these conceptions 
have not yet been reduced to definite and generally ac- 
cepted form. The goal which progressive educators 
have in mind may perhaps be indicated by Professor 
Hanus’s characterization of the modern school: 
“The education demanded by a democratic society 
to-day is an education that prepares a youth to overcome 
the inevitable difficulties that stand in the way of his 
material and spiritual advancement; an education that, 
from the beginning, promotes his normal physical devel- 
opment through the most salutary environment and 
appropriate physical training; that opens his mind and 
lets the world in through every natural power of observa- 
tion and assimilation; that cultivates hand-power as well 
as head-power; that inculcates the appreciation of beauty 
in nature and in art, and insists on the performance of 
duty to self and to others; an education that in youth and 
early manhood, while continuing the work already done, 
enables the youth to discover his own powers and limita- 
tions, and that impels him through oft-repeated intel-

PRESENT DAY PROBLEMS 5 
lectual conquests or other forms of productive effort to 
look forward to a life of habitual achievement with his 
head or his hands, or both; that enables him to analyze 
for himself the intellectual, economic, and political prob- 
lems of his time, and that gives the insight, the interest, 
and the power to deal with them as successfully as possi- 
ble for his own advancement and for social service: and, 
finally, that causes him to realize that the only way to 
win and to retain the prizes of life, namely, wealth, cul- 
ture, leisure, honor, is an ever-increasing usefulness, and 
thus makes him feel that a life without growth and with- 
out service is not worth living.’”’! 
The execution of any such scheme calls for adequate 
facilities and organization—a new and different type of 
plant, a revised program, a differentiated corps of teach- 
ers, a changed spirit in instruction. In all these respects 
progress has been made. Communities able to afford 
the necessary expenditure have begun to construct mod- 
ern school buildings and to reconstruct buildings already 
in use, so as to provide more or less satisfactory facilities 
in the way of gymnasiums, swimming pools, shops, and 
laboratories. But progress has been very uneven. No 
city has as yet executed a consistent policy. Many 
large cities still offer little beyond the traditional book 
studies. Not infrequently a period or two a week for 
girls in cooking and sewing, and an equal amount of 
time for boys in manual training in the two or three 
  
1Hanus: A Modern School (pp. 3-4).
-P-A-G-E-32
  6 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
upper grades of the elementary school, represent the 
total departure from the meager traditional scheme. 
The modern viewpoint calls, however, for adaptation 
as well as enrichment. The more liberal curriculum 
needs to be adjusted to the varying needs of children 
who differ in capacity. Some progress—also uneven, to 
be sure—can be reported in this matter. Most of our 
larger cities now have separate classes and special pro- 
grams for the mentally backward, for the blind, the deaf, 
and for children suffering with tuberculosis. Many cities 
provide differentiated courses in the upper grades, and 
in large schools, when there are a number of classes of 
the same grade, children are placed in the group in which 
they can do their best work. Nevertheless, statistics 
of elimination and retardation make clear that the schools 
have not yet adequately met the problem of providing 
programs adapted to wide differences in physical en- 
dowment, mental capacity, and vocational destination. _ 
Again, the modern school, in the sense in which Pro- 
fessor Hanus uses the term, does something more than 
teach and train. It aims to concentrate and localize 
the forces and agencies which make for child welfare. 
It furnishes medical inspection, and, when necessary, 
medical treatment; dental clinics, with free service for 
children whose parents cannot afford to pay; and play 
and recreation under school supervision. These are 
integral parts of a program which seeks to provide op- 
portunity not simply to master the tools of learning, but 
also to place children in contact with the world and the
-P-A-G-E-33
  PRESENT DAY PROBLEMS 7 
society in which they live and to make of them vigorous 
and capable boys and girls on the physical, social, and 
moral side as well as the intellectual. 
INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF TEACHERS 
Much has also been accomplished in developing better 
teachers. More has been required of those entering the 
profession, and a more efficient type of supervision has 
been generally introduced. Moreover, administrators 
are realizing that expert teaching cannot be expected 
from a single teacher in from eight to fifteen subjects. 
In many cities the seventh and eighth grades, and in 
some the sixth and even the fifth, have been organized 
so as to give to each instructor one or two subjects, 
instead of asking him to cover the whole field. But 
administrative officers hesitate to carry the departmental 
idea into the lower grades. Nevertheless, the problem 
must be faced if the elementary program is to be com- 
pletely modernized, and experiments in this direction 
are worthy of careful study. 
FINANCING THE SCHOOLS 
The adequate financing of public education on this 
broader basis is a difficult undertaking. Cities are in 
debt for school buildings and for other public improve- 
ments to the limit permitted by law, and in some cases 
almost to the point of bankruptcy. . The demand for a~ 
modern curriculum, involving large additions to build- 
ings and grounds, is frequently met with the objection
-P-A-G-E-34
  8 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
that the city cannot afford to make the required invest- 
ment—a forcible argument in a community, already 
bonded to the limit, which finds itself in urgent need of 
better streets, better fire protection, more adequate 
police, larger and more far reaching provision for 
public health. Any proposal, therefore, which prom- 
ises to make a dollar buy more deserves serious con- 
sideration. 
The Gary schools are of more than local interest be- 
cause they have tried to deal with these problems. 
They have made certain experiments looking to the en- 
richment and differentiation of the curriculum; certain 
innovations in the organization of the teaching staff; 
and they are trying to finance their enlarged facilities 
with funds raised by taxation. What they have done 
in the way of organization, administration, and finance 
cannot, however, be understood except in the light of 
the program of studies offered. The central problem is 
the problem of the curriculum, for on the educational 
opportunities thus offered depend the facilities that must 
pe provided, the type of organization needed to procure 
their effective and economical use, the quality and num- 
bers of the teaching staff, and, finally, the amount of 
money that must needs be raised. To the Gary pro- 
gram of studies and to the way in which this program is 
organized and administered, our attention must, there- 
fore, first be directed.
-P-A-G-E-35
  II. PROGRAM 
UR discussion of the Gary program of studies is 
confined to the elementary school, because the 
high school course is of conventional character.! 
The discussion is based on illustrations from the pro- 
grams of particular schools. The nine schools composing 
the system vary in size from the West Gary school, with 
two teachers and 46 pupils, to the Froebel school, with 
58 teachers and an enrollment of 2,087 children. The 
number of teachers, the enrollment, and the average 
daily attendance at each school for 1915-1916 were as 
follows:

  Io THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
TYPES OF WORK PROVIDED 
The elementary program of these schools provides 
for each class, as a rule, four distinct types of instruction: 
1. Academic work—the traditional school subjects— 
including reading, spelling, grammar, writing, arithmetic, 
geography, and history. 
2,. Special work, including handwork, drawing, sci- 
ence, cooking, sewing, manual training, forge, foundry, 
print shop, etc. 
3. Auditorium, including singing, music on the phon- 
ograph, or children’s performances on musical instru- 
ments, moving pictures, dramatics, individual or class 
exercises, etc. 
4. Physical education and play, including gymnastic 
exercises, and play in the playroom, on playgrounds or 
athletic fields. 
Consider, for example, the schedule of a primary grade 
at the Emerson school in the spring term, 1915-1916: 
8:15- 9:15 Language and numbers (academic) 
9:15-10:15 Handwork and nature study (special) 
1o:15-11:15 Play and physical training 
I1:15-12:15 Luncheon 
12:1§— 1:15 Handwork and nature study (special) 
r:1§— 2:15 Language and numbers (academic) 
2:15- 3:15 Auditorium 
3:1§- 4:15 Play and physical training 
This class, it will be observed, has daily two hours of 
academic work, 8:15 and 1:15; two hours of special work,

g:15 and 12:15; one hour of auditorium, 2:15; and two 
hours of play and physical training, 10:15 and 3:15, mak- 
ing in all a seven hour instruction day for the children, 
with an additional hour for luncheon. 
The schedule of a sixth grade Emerson class illustrates 
the same point:

This class has three hours of academic work, two hours 
of special, and one hour each of auditorium and physical 
training and play. 
The work of all classes in the Emerson school is simi- 
larly divided, as can be seen from Table I.! What is true 
of the types of work at Emerson school is true of the 
Froebel, Jefferson, and Beveridge schools, and almost 
equally true of the very smallest Gary schools,? as the 
following schedule of a primary class at the 24th Avenue 
school shows:

The plant of the 24th Avenue school consists of five 
portables and an old one room rural building. There are 
two kindergarten and five first and second grade classes. 
Yet these primary classes go to three different teachers 
and have three separate types of work: (a) the usual 
primary academic instruction; (b) special work, including 
literature, music, drawing, and nature study; and (c) play. 
VARIETY OF SPECIAL WORK AND CYCLES IN COURSES 
The Gary program is further distinguished by the 
variety of special work provided. There are, for ex- 
ample, at Emerson and Froebel separate elementary 
courses in chemistry, physics, botany, and zoology.

-P-A-G-E-42
  14 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Emerson offers forge, foundry, machine shop, and printing. 
Froebel gives cabinet work, tinsmithing, plumbing, paint- 
ing, printing, and shoe cobbling. In order that children 
may have opportunity to participate during their school 
careers ina number of such activities, special work in 
all Gary schools is broken up into short courses from ten 
weeks to a half year in length, and offered in cycles. 
For example, class 7 of Froebel, first grade, had nature 
study the first two terms of 1915-1916, and handwork 
and drawing the last two terms. Class 41, sixth grade, 
took, for the first ten weeks of 1915-1916, either 
physics or botany; the second ten weeks the entire 
class served as teachers’ assistants; the third ten weeks 
the boys took shop work and the girls sewing; and the 
fourth ten weeks the boys went te mechanical drawing 
and the girls to freehand drawing. 
While there are thus frequent changes in special 
work, and consequent changes in class programs, all] 
children of the lower grades—at least, in the larger schools 
—are supposed to have an equal and given amount of 
nature study, handwork, and freehand drawing, music, 
expression and application; and all children of the upper 
grades, an equal and given amount of drawing, science, 
and shop work, although the kind of drawing and science 
studied, and the particular shop experiences, may and do 
differ with the pupil, the class, and the school. 
Expression is instruction in story telling, dramatization, and literature. 
Application includes special drill and the application of principles to 
practical every-day problems. For full discussion, see The Gary Public 
_ Schools: A General Account, Chapter V.
-P-A-G-E-43
    PROGRAM 15 
Occasionally classes fail to get in given grades the 
specified amount of special instruction, and now and then 
classes get double the normal allotment. Yet these class 
cycles in special work are operated, on the whole, with 
commendable regularity, so that the number of special 
activities in which each class participates and the amount 
of time each class gives to each special activity are sur- 
prisingly uniform. For example, at Jefferson all classes 
through the 3C grade had at some time during 1915-1916 
music, expression, handwork or drawing, nature study, 
and application; and, with two exceptions, each class 
devoted the same amount of time respectively to these 
exercises. (Table II‘) Similarly, all sixth and upper 
grade classes had nature study, drawing, cooking, sew- 
ing, and shop (girls taking cooking and sewing, and boys, 
shop), and the several classes were in these respective 
branches approximately the same length of time.? At the 
same time attention must be called to the fact that though 
classes are for the most part regularly scheduled for 
special work, individual pupils are not infrequently quite 
irregular in the amount of special work they receive. 
This apparent inconsistency arises from the habit of allow- 
ing individuals to leave the class to which they properly 
belong for all sorts of reasons—some doubtless good, 
some undoubtedly questionable.?

  PROGRAM 17 
DIVISION OF TIME 
In the seven hour day of the larger schools, the ap- 
proximate time allotment to the four different types of 
work provided by the Gary program is as follows: to 
academic work, 120 to 180 minutes; to special work, 120 
minutes; to auditorium, 60 minutes; and to physical 
training and play, 60 to 120 minutes. Although the 
actual allotments vary with the term, the school, the 
grade, and at times the individual pupil, it is intended 
that physical training and play should be stressed in 
the lower grades, and academic work in the higher. 
Accordingly, 120 minutes are the usual assignment in the 
first classes both to academic work and to physical train- 
ing and play, whereas in classes for older children aca- 
demic work receives 180 minutes and physical training 
and play 60 minutes. The division of time, spring term 
1915-1916, for the elementary classes of Emerson is 
shown in Table III, on the following page.! 
When the seven hour pupil instruction day is 
so divided, some parts of the Gary program receive 
unusual emphasis. A comparison between the time 
allotted to each subject at Gary and to the same subjects 
in fifty representative cities of the country shows where 
unusual emphasis falls. It will be noted from Table 
IV’ that Gary gives slightly less time to the three R’s than

thefifty cities in question. The total difference, however, 
amounts to only 118 hours, which is insignificant when 
scattered through eight school years. Gary also gives 
somewhat less time than conventional schools to music, 
geography, and history, but it should be borne in mind 
that geography and history exercises, sometimes with 
moving pictures and sometimes of a more traditional 
sort, are given as a part of the auditorium work, and 
that a portion of most auditorium periods is devoted to 
work in music, involving both the more formal exercises, 
chorus work, and the enjoyment of music as rendered by 
pupils and teachers or as reproduced on the victrola.

cities is Gary’s emphasis on science, drawing and shop, 
auditorium, and physical training and play. Gary 
gives almost twice as much time to auditorium as is 
ordinarily devoted to opening exercises and miscellaneous 
matters combined, almost double the common allowance 
to drawing and shop, and almost treble the average allot- 
ment to physical training and recess,! resulting in a de- 
cided extension and enrichment of the elementary pro- 
gram.” 
PROGRAMS OF OTHER CITIES 
Where other systems® have followed the lead of Gary, 
their programs evidence the same general characteristics, 
and yet show interesting variations. 
In each case the school day has been lengthened, but 
the added time varies from thirty minutes to as much 
as two hours. 
All schedules provide academic work, special work, 
auditorium, and physical training and play. The time 
provisions for the academic studies follow conventional 
lines. Auditorium has its place in each program, but the 
use of the auditorium is not uniform. Kansas City, for 
example, has only two such exercises per week, and the 
length of the periods varies from forty to sixty minutes. 
Even in the smaller schools, which have a six hour pupil instruction 
day, these studies and activities receive more than the usual emphasis. 
For detailed discussion of the course of study, see The Gary Public 
Schools: A General Account, Ch. V. 
3One of the authors visited in this investigation the following systems, 
and this discussion is limited to these: Kalamazoo, Mich., Passaic, N. J., 
New York, N. Y., Newark, N. J., and Kansas City, Mo.

-P-A-G-E-51
PROGRAM 2i 
Probably the greatest difference is in the type of activ- 
ities included under special work and in the provision 
for physical training and play. These vary with the 
facilities available and with the extent of depart- 
mentalization which those in charge of the schools con- 
sider feasible. There are also the widest differences 
in the number of cycles in special work and consequent 
class changes from room to room. To illustrate: In 
contrast with the specialized shops of Emerson and 
Froebel, School Number Twelve of Passaic, New Jersey, 
provides general rooms for all work in the industrial and 
household arts below the seventh grade. These general 
rooms are each furnished for three types of elementary 
instruction. The equipment consists of a simple assort- 
ment of utensils and dishes for cooking; hand machines 
for sewing; and for handwork and manual training, scis- 
sors, rules, sand trays, and benches. Each room has, 
besides, forty stools, and 280 boxes, for the materials of 
the pupils using the room.! 
Despite these differences and variations, the several 
cities visited allot the conventional amount of time 
to the old line studies; and in addition give new emphasis 
to science, the household and industrial arts, and to 
physical education and play. 
SUMMARY 
The distinctive features of the Gary elementary pro- 
gram may therefore be summarized as follows: 
1For the complete program of this school, see Table F of the Appendix.
-P-A-G-E-52
  22 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
1. The program presupposes a longer school day. 
The day for pupils in the larger schools is seven instruc- 
tion hours, and in the smaller schools, six instruction 
hours, with an additional hour in both cases for luncheon. 
2. The program provides four types of work: academic 
instruction, including reading, writing, arithmetic, geog- 
raphy, and history; special work, including music, ex- 
pression, science, household and industrial arts, and 
drawing; auditorium; and physical training and play. 
The amount and variety of special work vary from 
school to school. 
3. In order that children may participate in a 
variety of special activities, courses in special work are 
from ten weeks to a half year in length and are taken 
in cycles. 
4. The school day is so apportioned among the four 
types of elementary instruction that the academic 
branches receive approximately the conventional amount 
of attention, and unusual emphasis is given to science, 
the industrial and household arts, auditorium, and physi- 
cal training and play. 
Thus, without disturbing the time allowance of the 
conventional studies, but by increasing the number of 
special activities and by emphasizing their importance, 
Gary enlarges the field of elementary education and puts 
the elementary school in position to render a fuller ser- 
vice at once to the community and to the child.

Il. PLANT 
S WE shall now see, the building facilities pro- 
vided at Gary have been determined to an 
unusual degree by the requirements of the 
school program. 
THE EMERSON SCHOOL 
Of the nine schools, Froebel and Emerson are the 
largest. Emerson is a modern building’ of the kind usu- 
ally found only in our largest cities, and contains the 
following service rooms:? 
30 regular classrooms 
7 special rooms adapted to laboratories or art studios 
2 household arts rooms 
2 industrial arts rooms 
x cabinet shop (a late addition) 
12 small inside rooms (for toilets, offices, storage, and the 
like) 
2 offices

2 gymnasiums 
1 swimming pool

24 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Although Emerson accommodates both an elemen- 
tary school and a high school, it is essentially an 
elementary school building. As such, it embodies a 
number of unusual features. The original plan did 
not, however, include all of these. In fact, the require- 
ments of a changing and developing program compelled 
repeated alterations and additions. Even now most 
of the special work is conducted in regular class- 
rooms—that is, in rooms which ‘a conventional system 
would employ for reading or arithmetic. To illus- 
trate, the 30 regular classrooms serve the following 
purposes:

The auditorium is unusual in size. The main 
hall is 60 by 53 feet, with a capacity of 546; the stage 
is of corresponding size, 50 by 21 feet, and there is a bal- 
cony 50 by 32 feet, equipped with fireproof lantern booth 
and 218 opera chairs. 
The present gymnasium facilities are likewise excep- 
tional. The boys’ gymnasium contains 3,400 square feet 
of floor space, and there are similar provisions for the 
girls. Each gymnasium has lockers, showers, and dress- 
ing rooms. In addition, there is an excellent swimming 
pool, 47 by 27 feet, of varying depths. 
So much for the building. What now of the equip- 
ment? The kindergarten rooms are particularly attrac- 
tive. They have the usual kindergarten materials, and 
are tastefully decorated with appropriate pictures and 
abundantly supplied with flowers and animal pets. 
The regular elementary school rooms—that is, those 
in which the children receive their academic instruction—
-P-A-G-E-56
  26 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
are in striking contrast. These rooms are, to be sure, 
well lighted, well ventilated, with ceilings of good height, 
and of standard size. They are furnished with single 
seated, non-adjustable desks of two or three sizes, sup- 
plemented in the primary rooms by kindergarten chairs. 
They have the usual slate blackboards, teacher’s desk, 
and small flat-top table of general utility. In either 
front corner stands an attractive case for the basic texts 
of the children using the room, for ample supplementary 
books, and for instructional supplies, but this is all. 
With few exceptions, the rooms themselves are devoid of 
decorative features. 
Three reasons account for the bare appearance of the 
classrooms. Instruction at Gary is to a considerable 
extent departmentalized. Most of what the children 
do in handwork, nature study, science, and drawing, 
which might give life and color to the room, is kept in the 
special rooms, leaving the regular rooms with little that 
lends itself to display. On the other hand, the authori- 
ties have intentionally failed to purchase decorations for 
particular classrooms, centering their efforts on the halls, 
to the end of making these the museums and art centers 
of the school. Finally, the teachers have done next to 
nothing themselves. This is probably due partly to the 
fact that some have been in the school only a short time, 
and partly to the fact that regular teachers do not have 
rooms of their own as they do in conventional school 
systems. 
Of the equipment for handwork, nature study, 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  PLANT 27 
music, and expression, there is only the furniture 
to note—for these classes, with the exception of music, 
occupy standard classrooms. The handwork room 
possesses specially designed single seated work desks;+ 
a sand box and aquarium constitute the additional 
equipment for nature study. The music room contains 
a piano, phonograph, cases for music, music racks, and 
iron-base revolving chairs of special design and adult 
size. The expression room has full-sized movable chairs 
with arm rests. The library is furnished with low book- 
cases, placed along the side walls, and with the usual 
flat-top reading tables and library chairs. 
How one judges the physics, chemistry, zoology, and 
botany laboratories, and the fine arts and mechanical 
drawing studios depends on whether they are regarded 
from the point of view of elementary or of high school 
facilities. As high school laboratories and studios they 
are comparable both in quarters—for, with the exception 
of physics, they occupy special rooms—and equipment 
with what is common to our good high schools. As ele- 
mentary school laboratories and studios they are probably 
unequaled anywhere in the country. In fact, elementary 
pupils hardly require such elaborate facilities. 
The household arts equipment is ample for simple 
courses in sewing and dressmaking, consisting of sew- 
ing machines, cutting tables, pressing boards, etc., 
but is scarcely sufficient for advanced high school in- 
struction. This is equally true of the cooking equip-

ment. High school and elementary school pupils use a 
single kitchen, which serves also the school’s cafeteria. 
In only one respect is the equipment exceptional, and 
that is in the facilities for preparing food in commercial 
quantities." 
The industrial arts facilities can be appreciated best 
by listing the fixtures of the respective shops. 
The machine shop, in a standard classroom, has three 
engine turning screw cutting lathes, one universal mill- 
ing machine, one 24 inch shaper, one 27 inch vertical 
drill with power feed, one small vertical drill, hand feed, 
one emery tool grinder. All of these are equipped with 
individual electrical motor drives. A bench equipped 
with five vises runs along one side of the shop, and a 
cupboard for small tools occupies one wall. 
The forge shop, in a special room, has five power blast 
hand forges, a pneumatic crank hammer, one combined 
power punch and shear, a bench equipped with three 
vises, an emery wheel, hand tools, and miscellaneous 
equipment. 
The foundry, in a special room, has a 22 inch cupola 
with charging gallery affording storage for coke and iron, 
a crucible brass furnace, gas furnace for melting lead or 
other easily fusible metals, core oven, scales, core bench, 
electric motor and fan for cupola blast, about a score of 
small flasks and several of larger size, and kits of molders’ 
tools. 
The printing shop, in a standard classroom, has one job

stitcher, lead cutter, imposing stone and frame, metal 
proof press, numbering machine, multiple power punch, 
vibrating roller, cutting machine, stock case, case stands, 
cut cabinet, type and cuts, and miscellaneous tools and 
equipment. The presses, wire stitcher, and power punch 
are supplied with individual motors. 
The cabinet making and wood turning shops, the one 
in a special room and the other in one of the small inside 
rooms, were idle at the time the survey was made. 
From the standpoint of the elementary school—and 
they are used chiefly by elementary pupils—these shops 
are unique in number and equipment. 
Finally, the gymnasium apparatus is simple, but ade- 
quate. The girls’ gymnasium has a piano and phono- 
graph, but the boys’ is without music. Each is furnished 
with climbing racks, wands, Indian clubs, basketball 
goals, etc. In addition, the boys’ gymnasium has climb- 
ing ladders, mats, parallel bars, and bucks. 
Emerson’s facilities are, however, not all within its 
walls. The school has unusual provisions for outdoor 
work, play and recreation. The building stands on the 
south end of a level improved plot, 607 by 306 feet, with 
a lawn frontage of 306 by 71 feet. The entire rear por- 
tion of the site is given over to outside activities. Di- 
rectly to the rear of the building on either side, a space 
66 by 44 feet supplies a handball court, sand box, and 
wading pool. North of the drive, which intersects the 
lot east and west, and on the east, is the playground for
-P-A-G-E-62
  30 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
girls and smaller children, the park with its winding 
walks, ornamental shrubs, and the “zoo,” together occu- 
pying an area 218 by 176 feet. The playground has 
swings, ladders, sliding bars, parallel bars, stationary 
bars, merry-go-rounds, teeter boards, etc. A much 
used tennis court occupies the center of the park, and 
along the walk to the left and west and at the rear are 
the animal houses of the “zoo.” To the north of the 
park, covering a plot 118 by 100 feet, are the poultry 
yard and poultry houses. 
On the left of the building, looking north, and across 
the drive is the main playground, 336 by 120 feet, de- 
signed especially for older boys.’ Finally, on the ex- 
treme north and between the boys’ playground on the 
left and the poultry yard on the right are the school gar- 
dens, 118 by 76 feet. 
To complete the description, across the street, to the 
east, is the Emerson athletic field,? occupying one entire 
block, 607 by 286 feet in extent. This field is only partly 
developed, but when completed will comprise a running 
track, a football field, a baseball field, and coasting hill. 
THE FROEBEL SCHOOL 
Having described the Emerson school in detail, we may 
deal more briefly with the Froebel school, which is of the 
same general type.’

Froebel contains practically the same number and 
same types of rooms:!

special rooms adapted to laboratories or art studios 
household arts rooms

small offices 
small rooms for rest, offices, or storage

HN HR NNN AN 
In comparison with Emerson, Froebel has only three 
structural features of interest: (1) two nature study 
rooms, constructed by adding observatories to two ground 
floor standard classrooms and installing demonstration 
tables; (2) a larger auditorium—the main hall fitted with 
598 opera chairs, and the balcony with 235; and (3) an 
additional pool. 
Froebelhas undergone repeated alterations and changes. 
Yet, as in Emerson, rooms are employed for purposes 
for which they were not originally constructed. To 
illustrate, take the present use of the twenty-eight stand- 
ard classrooms, which is as follows:

The similarity between Emerson and Froebel extends 
also to equipment, with the exception of the shops. The 
only shop common to both schools is the printing shop. 
Those peculiar to Froebel are the woodworking, sheet 
metal, plumbing, paint, and shoe shops, which are 
equipped as follows. 
The woodworking shop, in a special room, has an equip- 
ment of mill tools, each supplied with individual electric 
motor, including band saw, circular saw, jointer, planer, 
mortising machine, swing cutting off saw; three long 
benches, thirteen individual woodworking benches, each 
supplied with vises and equipment of small tools; three 
speed lathes furnished with electric motors, a tool grinder, 
cupboards, and miscellaneous tools and equipment. 
The sheet metal shop, in a special room, has one 36 
inch heavy squaring shear, one No. 4 tinner’s bench 
shear, one 36 inch adjustable bar folder, can top folder, 
36 by 2 inch pipe forming rolls, 30 inch grooving machine,

burring machine, large burring machine, small turner,
-P-A-G-E-65

large turner, wiring machine, setting down machine, 
cornice maker’s crimper, 2 inch double seamer, and an 
assortment of bench stakes and mandrels. 
The plumbing shop, in a regular classroom, has a 
plumber’s bench and three vises, stock rack, and mis- 
cellaneous tools and supplies. 
The paint shop, in one of the small basement rooms, 
has paint, oil, brushes, and miscellaneous supplies. 
The shoe shop, in one of the small basement rooms, 
has benches, cobbler’s tools, leather, and other supplies. 
In respect to outdoor facilities, Froebel is even more 
generously provided for than Emerson. For example, 
the building stands on a magnificent, level, developed site 
575 by 820 feet, with a park frontage of 575 by 289 feet. 
Playgrounds cover an area of 575 by roo feet, and there 
are two gardens instead of one as at Emerson, the elemen- 
tary garden measuring 142 by 131 feet, and the high 
school garden 148 by 126 feet. Adjoining these 
grounds to the north is an athletic field 575 by 278 
feet, which, although owned by the city, is under the 
control of the board of education and at the service of 
Froebel.* 
To summarize all that has been said: Emerson 
and Froebel are excellent modern plants, having—at 
least for elementary school buildings—unusual laborato- 
ries and art studios, unusually large auditoriums, excep- 
tional indoor facilities for physical education, and unique 
outdoor provisions for work, play, and recreation. Also,

  34 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
they are excellent examples of present day school archi- 
tecture, with the usual provisions for household and 
industrial arts, but without special structural provisions 
for handwork and music. 
THE JEFFERSON SCHOOL 
Next to Emerson and Froebel, the best plant is Jef- 
ferson,! built by the Gary Land Company and afterward 
sold to the board of education. Although erected in 
1907, Jefferson was of the type built twenty to twenty- 
five years ago to accommodate the conventional school 
program. The requirements of the Gary program neces- 
sitated additions and alterations, so that Jefferson is 
now a good example of a building remodeled so as to per- 
mit the introduction of some modern features. As re- 
modeled, Jefferson provides the following facilities:

  PLANT 38 
These facilities are, however, not as adequate nor as 
ample as might appear from the above list. To be sure, 
the regular classrooms, although the lighting is not en- 
tirely satisfactory, are unusually spacious—33 by 27 
feet, with cloak halls 27 by 7 feet—and some of them 
are attractively decorated. On the other hand, the na- 
ture study room is merely a regular classroom, with a 
partition running across ten feet from the rear to make 
an observatory and storage room, and yet it serves well 
the desired purpose. The auditorium, on the second floor, 
is 43 by 40 feet, fitted with 234 opera chairs, and has a 
stage 27 by 11 feet. Cooking and sewing share one of the 
good sized basement rooms, and although the room has 
been done over and specially equipped, it is neither well 
lighted nor well ventilated. The basement quarters of me- 
chanical drawing and of industrial arts are even less desir- 
able and should perhaps not be used for instruction. The 
gymnasium, occupying the remodeled attic, is inconven- 
iently located and its use involves a certain fire hazard. 
Jefferson also has outside facilities, although these are 
small in comparison with those of the two major plants; 
nevertheless, Jefferson has an attractive lawn frontage 
a school garden 80 by 70 feet, a playground for girls and 
smaller children, 127 by 124 feet, and a playground and 
athletic field for older boys, 255 by 126 feet. 
THE GLEN PARK SCHOOL 
The other parts of the Gary school plant are very much 
inferior to the three schools we have described. They 
are, indeed, distinctly inadequate. The best of these is
-P-A-G-E-68
  36 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
the Glen Park school, located in a community well estab- 
lished before the founding of Gary and annexed in 1912 
with other outlying districts. The Glen Park plant com- 
prises a new two story, six room brick structure, with a 
gymnasium addition, and three portables‘; but even here, 
although the plant is ill adapted, there are evidences of 
effort to extend the curriculum and enrich school life. 
The two upper rooms of the main structure, each 29 
by 25 feet, with improvised cloak hall, 25 by 6 feet, are 
reserved for academic instruction; a kindergarten occu- 
pies one of the first floor rooms, 34 by 29 feet, and the 
other, also 34 by 29 feet, serves for classes in music, ex- 
pression, and auditorium. The gymnasium, 44 by 18 feet, 
is so contrived that, when not in use, it provides the 
auditorium with a stage. 
One of the two basement rooms, neither of which, ow- 
ing to poor lighting and ventilation, is satisfactory, ac- 
commodates the cooking and sewing, and the other, the 
manual training. One portable is vacant, but used oc- 
casionally for physical training; a regular teacher occupies 
the second; and the third is given up to handwork, 
mechanical drawing, and nature study. 
Since portables of practically one type are found at 
each of the remaining plants, a single description will 
answer for all. Each portable provides a classroom 25 
by 31 feet, amply lighted from one side. The low, 
gabled roof is usually of tin, the ceiling, of sheet 
iron. While the floor is substantial, the side walls are

frail, composed of upright wall posts, exposed on the 
inside and covered on the outside with thin weather 
boarding. A lean-to, six feet wide and generally ex- 
tending across one entire end, provides an entrance hall 
and cloak room, and when there is only one outside door 
there is usually also a small storage room. Such school 
accommodations, though unattractive, answer fairly well 
as temporary quarters, and when heated with standard 
heaters, as is the rule at Gary, are reasonably comfort- 
able. They serve various purposes, but, whether pro- 
vided for regular academic instruction or special activi- 
ties, they are furnished and equipped like corresponding 
rooms of the main buildings, although generally less well. 
Though Glen Park is a small school, it has outside 
facilities not always equaled by the best plants of 
other cities. It occupies a site 254 by 203 feet. To the 
front of the building, on the south, are lawn plots, 63 
by 50 feet and 97 by 79 feet, respectively; the school 
garden measures 97 by 61 feet; the poultry run, 57 by 9 
feet; and there is a well equipped playground, 156 by 
139 feet. 
THE BEVERIDGE SCHOOL 
The Beveridge school, in an old settlement on the 
southwest which was incorporated as a part of Gary in 
1912, is even less adequate than the Glen Park school. 
The plant consists of a relatively new, but extremely 
poor, six room brick building, an old two story, two room 
frame structure, and five portables.! 
1See illustration opposite page 68. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  38 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Efforts to modernize instruction are, however, as 
evident here as at Glen Park. Three of the first and 
second floor rooms of the brick building accommodate 
academic classes, the fourth is fitted out for handwork 
and drawing. The school cafeteria occupies one of the 
basement rooms, and manual training, the other. 
The upper room of the old frame building (32 by 23 
feet), fitted with the usual nonadjustable desks of mixed 
sizes, and heated by an ordinary coal stove surrounded 
by an improvised shield, serves for nature study, the 
nature study equipment consisting of two flat top tables, 
four small animal cages, an aquarium, a few well selected 
books, a number of good bird pictures, and a storage case. 
The lower room, likewise heated by an ordinary sheathed 
stove, is the school auditorium. The stage occupies 
23 by 8 feet, leaving for the auditorium proper an area of 
only 24 by 23 feet, into which are crowded 98 opera 
chairs and frequently as many children. 
Kindergartens occupy two of the portables, a third 
is used for advanced academic classes, and two have been 
ingeniously joined end on end to make a gymnasium.! 
The outdoor facilities at Beveridge are likewise less 
liberal than at the schools we have described. Neverthe- 
less, between the brick building and the frame structure 
there is a lawn plot 50 by 50 feet, the school garden covers 
an area of 168 by 20 feet, and there is play space aggre- 
gating 130 by 100 feet. |

OTHER SCHOOLS 
The Clarke school, in the extreme northwestern end of 
Gary, is a two room rural school. The building is of the 
traditional two room rural type, and the school differs 
mainly from similar schools elsewhere in the playground 
apparatus provided and in its gardens. The play- 
grounds are 131 by 82 feet and the garden 62 by 16 feet. 
Of the remaining plants, Ambridge, 24th Avenue, and 
West Gary, there is little to report, for the building in 
each case consists of a group of portables. However, it is 
a notable fact that without exception there are provi- 
sions for outdoor work, play, and recreation. For ex- 
ample, Ambridge, in the northwest section of the city, 
is quartered in five portables! The grounds, which be- 
long to the Gary Land Company, are 200 by 150 feet, 
and, although undeveloped, supply a garden space 55 by 
18 feet, and two playgrounds, one 70 by 50 and the other 
150 by 70 feet, each provided with appropriate equipment. 
The 24th Avenue school, midway between Froebel and 
Glen Park, occupies a site 140 by 120 feet, and consists of 
five portables and an old rural building, 30 by 20 feet, 
used for a playroom. Scattered about between the 
buildings are three play spaces: (a) 20 by 20 feet; (b) 
50 by 26 feet; and (c) 72 by 50 feet. A vacant lot, 118 
by 55 feet, which lies across the street next to the school, 
provides a school garden.”

  40 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS | 
West Gary, located at the extreme west of the city, 
occupies two portables, one of which is vacant part of 
the time. But even here there is an attempt at garden- 
ing, and both space and equipment are provided for play 
and recreation. r 
SUMMARY 
The different parts of the Gary school plant thus repre- 
sent extremes. The two modern buildings, Emerson 
and Froebel, the only schools of size planned and erected 
by the present school authorities, fairly realize the Gary 
ideal and are excellent. Remodeled Jefferson is not unlike 
the older buildings in many cities. Glen Park and Beve- 
ridge are entirely inadequate for their present programs 
and enrollment. The remaining plants, with the exception 
of Clarke, are confessedly makeshifts. Nevertheless, it is 
worthy of note that the ideal of an enriched curriculum 
and enriched school life permeates the system throughout, 
for all schools, even those in the least favored districts, 
have some facilities, however meager, for nature study, 
gardening, household and industrial arts, physical educa- 
tion, recreation and play. It is also worthy of note that 
there is a close relation between the plant provided and 
the program of studies offered. Finally it is to be said 
that two of the obviously: unsatisfactory plants, Glen 
Park and Beveridge, were erected by small communities, 
since annexed to Gary. Gary has simply tried to make 
the best of them.
-P-A-G-E-75
  IV. ORGANIZATION 
HE requirements of the program also determine 
in large measure the organization of the Gary 
schools. 
DEPARTMENTAL INSTRUCTION 
As stated before, administrators, even those dealing 
with conventional courses, realize that a teacher can- 
not teach well a dozen different studies. To meet 
the requirements of their programs, high schools 
generally departmentalize. A single instructor teaches 
one or at most two or three academic branches, and there 
is usually a teacher forseach of the sciences, as well as 
separate teachers for drawing, music, the household 
arts, the industrial arts, and physical training. Fre- 
quently there is a similar division of work in the seventh 
and eighth grades of the elementary school, but this 
seldom goes lower. 
Owing to the conventional character of their programs, 
the Gary high schools have, with the probable exception 
of science and shops, only the usual amount of depart- 
mentalization. 
: On the other hand, the amount of departmentaliza- 
tion in the seventh and eighth grades is uncommonly 
41
-P-A-G-E-76
  42 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
large. The courses of these grades include reading, 
spelling, language, handwriting, arithmetic, geography, 
and history, besides freehand and mechanical drawing, 
auditorium, play and physical training, and, in the two 
largest schools, physics, chemistry, zoology and botany, 
cooking and sewing for girls, and from three to a half 
dozen specialized industrial activities for boys. Obvi- 
ously, no single teacher can carry such a program, nor 
can a single room be appropriately equipped for all these 
branches. It is necessary either to be content with a less 
extended course of study, or to departmentalize, equip 
special rooms, and employ teachers with special training 
for particular fields. Gary chooses the latter alternative. 
Accordingly, in the two largest schools, seventh and 
eighth grade instruction is divided among something 
like thirteen teachers for girls and as many as seventeen 
for boys, approximately as follows:   
Academic studies 
Auditorium. . 
Physical education 
Science . . 
Freehand drawing . 
Mechanical Te 
Cooking . . 
Sewing . . . 
Industrial arts .

In consequence, seventh and eighth grade pupils seldom 
have less than eight to ten different teachers during the 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  ORGANIZATION 43 
course of a single year. This, however, does not mean 
that when a child advances from the seventh to the eighth 
grade he comes under a new group of teachers. The 
same special teachers have classes in both grades, so that 
a child advancing from the lower to the higher may 
change only one or two instructors. 
The opportunities offered in the two largest schools 
to fourth, fifth, and sixth grade pupils are practically the 
same as those offered to the seventh and eighth grades; 
the only real difference is in the level of the instruction. 
In consequence, there is no difference in the amount of 
departmentalization. The only exception worthy of 
note is this: Fourth to sixth grade pupils have as a rule 
only one or two academic instructors, whereas seventh 
and eighth grade pupils ordinarily have three. The total 
number of teachers that a class of fourth, fifth, or sixth 
grade pupils has in a single year is, therefore, seldom 
less than nine. 
To meet the requirements of the primary program 
(grades 1 to 3) the work is divided, in the larger schools, 
approximately as follows: 
Academic studies . 1 teacher 
Auditorium . I 
Physical education | I

-P-A-G-E-78
    44 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Primary pupils, therefore, instead of having a single 
teacher, as is the common practice, generally have, in 
the two larger schools, as many as eight different bse 
tors in the course of a school year, although they may 
not have more than one or two additional new teachers 
until after they pass into the fourth grade. 
Departmentalization extends, therefore, in the larger 
Gary schools—and in certain of the smaller ones, for that 
matter—throughout the grades. This permits an un- 
usual amount of specialization among the elementary 
teachers. A regular grade teacher seldom teaches more 
than three of the old line studies and her work rarely 
ranges over more than two different grades. There are 
special teachers, for the first three years, in handwork 
and drawing, and in nature study. All of the aaah 
as well as cooking, sewing, freehand and mechanical 
drawing, and all of the industrial arts have their special- 
ists, with work extending upward from the fourth grade. 
Finally, there are instructors in music, in expression, and 
in play and physical training, whose work may and often 
does range from beginners to the senior high school class. 
MOVEMENT OF CLASSES FROM ROOM TO ROOM 
When a school is departmentalized, one of two things 
takes place: Either the pupils go from room to room for 
their instruction, or the teachers go from room to room 
to meet their several classes. Where the program is as 
highly specialized as in the larger Gary schools, and 
where so many special rooms and so much special ig

  ORGANIZATION 45 
ment are required, pupils must circulate from instructor to 
instructor. For play and physical training they go to the 
gymnasium and playground, for physics, to the physics lab- 
oratory, for forge, totheforge shop. Accordingly, all class- 
es in the two larger schools circulate from room to room.

  40 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
This class occupied daily six different places; but two 
periods in succession were spent in one room (Room 120). 
The movement from room to room of these two classes 
is representative of both Emerson and Froebel.! Few 
classes in these schools occupy less than four rooms 
daily and occasionally classes go to different rooms every 
period of the day. 
A similar movement of classes takes place in ollie or 
in high school, and also commonly in the seventh and 
eighth grades of the elementary school. But it is a nov- 
elty in the primary and intermediate grades, where it is 
the inevitable result of departmentalization and the policy 
of keeping all facilities as far as possible in constant 
use. 
Rotation of elementary classes involves complete 
abandonment of the idea that each class should have a 
home room where the children spend the greater part of 
the school day and where they do most, if not all, their 
school work. It involves also abandonment of the no- 
tion that each child should have a seat which he may 
regard as his own. In the most highly developed Gary

locker in which he stores his wraps and his books. What 
effect this shifting from room to room, this absence of a 
school home in the old sense and lack of a reserved seat, 
has on attendance, conduct, and study it is impossible 
at present to say. Obviously, much will depend on 
proper arrangements for caring for books and wraps, and

on whether class changes are conducted in an orderly 
manner. 
SEQUENCE IN CLASS PROGRAM 
In conventional elementary schools, offering a simple 
academic program, the teacher proceeds daily with her 
assigned class from study to study, from exercise to ex- 
ercise. The order of the day’s work for all classes is es- 
sentially the same: Opening exercises take place at 9:05; 
arithmetic comes at 9:20; reading, 9:50; etc. On the 
theory that children do their hard work best in the 
morning, the more difficult studies, such as reading and 
arithmetic, occupy the forenoon, and the less exacting, 
such as handwriting and music, the afternoon. 
In aschool having highly departmentalized instruction, 
the teacher gives successive lessons in the same study or 
studies; for example, she will give arithmetic to class 5 
at 9:15; more advanced instruction in the same subject 
to class 6 at 10:15; and so on, throughout the day, to 
different classes. Her work is arranged just as is the 
work of the Latin or Greek teacher. Consequently, if 
teachers doing specialized work in special rooms, and 
with special equipment, are to be kept fully employed, 
the order of the day’s work of the several classes must 
differ greatly. One class will have to begin the day with 
academic work and end it with physical training; an- 
other class will need to do just the opposite, starting with 
physical training and finishing with academic work. 
The programs for the spring term 1915-16 of four Emer-

was as follows: |

The great diversity in sequence is apparent. Class 4 
begins te day with physical training, while class 9 be- 
gins with academic instruction, probably with reading 
or arithmetic. All the academic work of class 9 comes 
before 1:15, while that of class 12 is scheduled from 
1:15 to 4:15. As suggested above, this diversity is 
not a matter of choice—it is an inevitable consequence 
of an enriched program and the policy of keeping all 
facilities in use as nearly as possible all the time. Un- 
questionably the order of work of many Gary classes con- 
   
-P-A-G-E-85
  ORGANIZATION 49 
travenes conventional ideas and practice, particularly 
in those cases where play and physical training, audi- 
torium, and shop consume the morning hours and where 
all academic work is placed in the last two or three 
periods of the long day. 
The point under discussion is of serious importance. 
Is there sound objection to the diversified sequence of 
studies and activities characteristic of Gary? How does 
it affect the child’s health, habits of work, and actual 
achievements? Do children who do their intellectual 
tasks in the morning hours fare better than those who do 
them in the afternoon? Unfortunately, the question 
cannot be answered on the basis of assured knowledge. 
Neither class testing nor observation warrants us in ex- 
pressing a definite judgment, pro or con. 
SIZE OF INSTRUCTION GROUPS 
In conventional schools, having the usual academic 
program, with a single teacher instructing a class, it is 
difficult to recognize differences in the instructional 
requirements of the several studies. All classes or 
instruction groups are of approximately the same size, 
ranging from thirty-five to forty pupils. To be sure, 
in the primary grades, a teacher frequently divides 
a class for reading and number into two and sometimes 
three separate squads, while in the remainder of the pro- 
gram the class works as a single unit. Likewise in the 
upper grades, where cooking for girls and manual training 
for boys are offered, to meet the instructional require-
-P-A-G-E-86
  50 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
ments of these activities, both are scheduled for the same 
period in order that the girls, approximately half of the 
class, may go to the one while the boys report to the other. 
When the school program is enriched or diversified the 
number of studies is increased and differences in instruc- 
tional requirements are more clearly brought out. What 
is best for the academic branches is one thing, what is 
best for science and the household and industrial arts is 
another, what is best for the auditorium, for play and 
physical training, yet another. Departmentalization 
and rotation of classes, the inseparable complements of an 
extended and enriched curriculum, make possible the 
recognition of these differences. 
Accordingly there are decided differences in the larger 
Gary schools as respects the size of the various instruc- 
tion groups. The average size of academic classes is 
approximately thirty-six pupils., The upper grade 
classes in science, in household arts and in the industrial 
arts are only half as large as the academic instructional 
groups, and shop classes are frequently even smaller. 
On the other hand, auditorium groups are seldom 
less on three times the size of academic groups and   occasionally seven and eight times as large, as can be seen 
from Table VI.t

and enrichment of the curriculum. It remains to call 
attention to two other features of the Gary organiza- 
tion. First, high school pupils often take charge, usu- 
ally under the direction of a teacher, of elementary school 
and even of high school classes, and both high school 
and upper grade pupils assist in the routine work of keep- 
ing records, handling supplies, placing work on the black- 
board, correcting papers, and coaching individuals or 
small groups of children. Younger children are also 
assigned as observers or helpers to classes in which more 
mature hi are working. ‘The different grades repre- 
sented in typical shop classes are shown in Table VIII. 
Young children are placed with older children, as ob- 
servers or helpers, on the theory that the situation thus 
created duplicates actual life conditions where children 
learn from observing or helping their parents or older

as assistants on the theory that there is something in 
school routine that can be best learned by doing it. 
These practices are to be viewed with considerable doubt. 
While turning over classes or even individual pupils to 
children without experience and special training may be 
more or less profitable to the pupil acting as teacher, it 
certainly does not operate to the advantage of the class 
and undermines standards of professional prepara- 
tion. As to the value of observers or helpers and as- 
sistants to teachers in routine matters, opinions will dif- 
fer. In our judgment school authorities should hesitate 
to adopt this feature of the Gary organization until care- 
fully scrutinized experience has demonstrated its worth 
and limitations.’

The second feature alluded to above is the intimate 
union of 
building elementary school and high school in the same 
under one management. There were at Gary

as at Gary, the general practice is to separate 
school from the elementary school. There are

both economic and educational grounds for so doing and 
it is at least worth considering whether Gary would not 
gain by establishing a single modern high school with a 
plant and organization of its own. 
SUMMARY 
Program, facilities, and organization thus hang to- 
gether. In the development of the modern elementary 
school a solution must be found in which they function 
harmoniously. Gary offers one solution, adopting and 
freely using the devices above noted—departmentaliza- 
tion, class rotation, diversity of class schedules, and vari- 
ation in size of instruction groups. In the foregoing 
pages, an effort has been made to present the resulting 
situation descriptively. As to the precise effects of these 
devices upon the pupils, it is impossible to speak at this 
time. Gary—and in this respect it resembles other 
school systems—has not yet studied itself. Its products, 
as reported in the successive parts of this report, are cer- 
tainly not due entirely to the manner in which the schools 
are organized. Other factors undoubtedly also play 
their part—the qualifications and skill of the teachers, 
the kind of supervision, etc. 
The authors of this report believe that the devices 
characteristic of the Gary organization are highly valu- 
able, but they are at the same time inclined to think 
that they have probably been pushed too far; e.g., that 
departmentalization has been somewhat overdone, that 
_ For a fuller discussion of this point, see pages 82-83.
-P-A-G-E-96
   THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
classes move too freely from room to room, that the 
program sequence of certain classes is more or less in- 
judicious, and that instruction groups are now too small 
for economy, and now too large for effective teaching. 
In the long run, however, not opinion, but facts must 
decide the issues involved, and these facts can unques- 
tionably be procured. For example, we have pointed out 
that class schedules are now so arranged that one class 
will play in the early morning and do its work in the 
early afternoon, while another class—or the same class 
another term—reverses the arrangement. Now, is there 
any reason why children should not play in the early 
hours of the morning and do their classroom work in the 
early hours of the afternoon? Gary assumes and be- 
lieves that there is no objection. Is there? No one 
really knows. The question lends itself, however, to 
experimental inquiry. Given classes might readily be 
carried for a series of years alternating the former arrange- 
ment with the latter, while other classes are carried with 
the common order of studies. A series of graphs might 
show whether the level of class work is affected by the 
factor here under discussion. Other experiments could 
be devised for the purpose of determining the question. 
Of course, the settlement of issues in this way requires 
time and varied confirmation of results But our point 
is that, whereas innovation and experiment in organiza- 
tion are urgently needed, they must be held to strict 
accountability. Reforms are ultimately to be recom- 
mended only on the basis of their fruits.     
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  
V. USE OF PLANT 
the Gary schools affected the plant and instruc- 
tional facilities that have to be provided. It now 
remains to be seen how the program, with the type of 
organization above described, affects the number of pupils 
that a given building will accommodate. 
In the course of this discussion we shall, for brevity 
and convenience, employ two terms which it is necessary 
first of all to explain. We shall speak of the “conven- 
tional” or “traditional” type of school, and the “semi- 
modern” type of school. By conventional or traditional 
school we mean roughly to indicate the type of school 
that possesses a plant consisting of a given number 
of classrooms, suitable for academic instruction, a more 
or less inadequate school yard, and little or nothing else. 
Its program includes morning exercises, the three R’s, 
geography and history, with music and perhaps a little 
drawing as incidentals. The classroom is the unit, each 
teacher carrying the entire program of her class. Most 
public elementary schools are of this type. 
The plant of a semimodern school’ has regular class- 
rooms, at least a cooking and a manual training room, and 
an auditorium, if not a gymnasium. In addition, there I: A preceding chapter we saw how the program of 
59 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  60 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
may be one or two basement playrooms and more or less 
spacious grounds. The program includes morning ex- 
ercises, the three R’s, geography and history, music 
and drawing, cooking and manual training, with some 
science and physical training. Its organization is also 
of the classroom type, with the general exception of 
cooking and manual training, and now and then of sub- 
jects like handwriting, draw'ng, and music. When a 
class is at work in a special room, in the auditorium, or at 
play in the basement or on the school grounds, its home 
room or regular room is usually vacant. Our better ele- 
mentary schools may be fairly called semimodern in the 
sense just indicated. 
A modern school, if we may revert to Professor Hanus’s 
description, would be distinguished by the reorganization 
of the common subjects, the variety of additional oppor- 
tunities, and by a type of organization that takes full 
advantage of the enriched program and effectively uses 
the enlarged facilities The Gary schools, at their best, 
represent an attempt to advance from the semimodern 
toward the modern type—with what degree of success 
will appear from the different volumes of the survey. 
The semimodern school differs from the conventional 
school to the extent that its plant facilities and educa- 
1The inference should, however, not be drawn from this that a conven- 
tional or even a semimodern school can be completely modernized by 
the mere addition of new studies and activities to its program. This 
involves also a revaluation of the fundamentals and a thoroughgoing 
redetermination of their content.

tional opportunities are more varied; both have the 
same type of organization. The Gary schools—Froebel 
and Emerson particularly—differ from the semimodern 
school partly because the Gary facilities are better, partly 
because the Gary program is richer, and partly because 
the organization is more flexible and adequate. For 
conventional and semimodern schools alike adhere to the 
classroom type, while Gary utilizes the departmental 
type described in the preceding chapter. In the present 
chapter we shall consider the relation between facilities, 
organization, and enrollment. 
PUPIL CAPACITY AND PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS 
It is not difficult to get full service out of a conven- 
tional plant. The building, consisting mainly of a num- 
ber of regular classrooms, has its full complement of 
pupils when a standard sized class is assigned to each 
room. Even when a school possesses an auditorium, gym- 
nasium, cooking and manual training rooms, these do not 
always add to the pupil capacity, for, under the conven- 
tional organization, when classes occupy special rooms for 
a period or two daily their regular or home rooms are 
ordinarily vacant. Hence, it is approximately correct 
to say that the maximum pupil capacity of a conventional 
or a semimodern school plant, under the old or classroom 
type of organization, is equal to the number of standard 
classrooms multiplied by the number of pupils in a 
full sized academic class. Assuming this to consist
-P-A-G-E-102
re 
62 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
of forty pupils, a plant of 4o regular classrooms would 
accommodate a maximum of 1,600 pupils. 
Under the new or departmental type of organization, 
classes, as stated above, do not have home rooms, nor do 
children have reserved seats. They circulate throughout 
the day from room to room, sometimes going as a class, 
sometimes divided into sections, sometimes going as in- 
dividuals independent of any class organization, while at 
other times the members of a number of classes are com- 
bined into a single instructional group. Hence, an ele- 
mentary plant under the new type of organization ac- 
commodates its maximum number of pupils when every 
room, whether regular or special, auditorium or gymna- 
sium, is in use every period of the school day, or as nearly 
thereto as possible. Thus the actual maximum pupil 
capacity of a given plant, or the maximum use that can 
be made of it under the departmental type of organiza- 
tion, depends upon the relation between the plant facili- 
ties and the requirements of the program followed. 
An illustration will make this clear. The Froebel audi- 
torium has a pupil capacity (main floor and balcony 
combined) of 873, or 20 classes, a total of 120 stand- 
ard sized classes for a six hour instruction day. But 
educational considerations impose limitations on the 
size of auditorium groups. Besides, Froebel’s esti- 
mated maximum capacity is 60 classes, and the pro- 
posed program calls for a single auditorium period for 
only 48 classes.! Therefore, irrespective of what the 
1See Table G of the Appendix. 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  USE OF PLANT 63 
physical capacity of the Froebel auditorium may be, as 
limited by the requirements of the proposed program, its 
practical maximum capacity is only 48 classes daily. 
Should further consideration on educational grounds re- 
duce the number of classes using the auditorium, the real 
capacity of the school would be correspondingly reduced. 
This is precisely what occurs under the new type of 
organization with certain facilities when program require- 
ments change. For example, at Emerson the cabinet 
and woodturning shops together have a daily capacity, 
on a six hour pupil instruction day basis, of 240 pupils, 
but the Emerson program no longer includes these ac- 
tivities. As it is not easy to use these shops for other 
instructional purposes, they are for the moment idle. 
In consequence, these two shops under the present 
program are not a part of the working capacity of Emer- 
son; they simply do not count. 
On the other hand, changes in program requirements 
may operate to augment facilities. For example, the 
Froebel program of 1915-1916 provided tinsmithing 
and plumbing. The tin shop, 50x24 feet, and the 
plumbing shop, a standard classroom, had a combined 
capacity for any one period of not more than 20 pupils, 
or a total daily capacity, on a six hour pupil instruction 
day, of 120 children. The Froebel program for 1916- 
1917 included neither tinsmithing nor plumbing. The 
tin shop was converted into a kindergarten and primary 
playroom, with a period capacity of 120 children, and the 
plumbing shop was restored to regular classroom use.
-P-A-G-E-104
  64 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Thus, by a change in program requirements and conse- 
quent change in use, the actual period capacity of the 
rooms which these two shops occupied was raised from 
20 to 160 or increased 700 per cent. 
Illustrations might be multiplied showing how actual 
plant capacity is invariably conditioned by the require- 
ments of the program, but enough have been cited to 
make two points clear: First, that it is a more difficult 
administrative task to get full use out of an elementary 
plant under the departmental than under the conven- 
tional type of organization; second, that it is impossible 
to estimate or determine the capacity of a given elemen- 
tary plant under the new type of organization except on 
the basis of the requirements of a particular program. 
PUPIL CAPACITY OF EMERSON AND FROEBEL 
No single program has ever been followed long enough 
at either Emerson or Froebel to determine experimentally 
the respective maximum capacities of these two schools 
under the new type of organization, nor have other 
necessary conditions been favorable to such determina- 
tion. At no time has the number of pupils within reach 
of Emerson been more than half enough to fill it,) and 
now for the first time are there sufficient pupils to make 
something like full use of Froebel.? It should, however, 
be borne in mind that in each instance these plants were 
erected to provide for a rapidly growing population and

not to accommodate a given number of children already 
at hand. 
Of this much we are certain: With a conventional pro- 
gram, and under the traditional classroom organization, 
they could accommodate 40 classes of 40 pupils, or a total 
of 1,600 elementary children, and this, too, apart from 
any use whatsoever of auxiliary rooms, auditorium, or 
gymnasium.* 
Under the new type of organization, and with a given 
program, the maximum capacity of Emerson and of 
Froebel is officially estimated at 60 classes, or 2,300 pupils, 
as follows: 
6 kindergarten classes of sopupilseach . . . 300

8 seventh and eighth grade classes of 3 s pupils

12 high school classes of 30 pupils each ae ine. 360? 
If the educational conditions imposed by the proposed 
program are accepted, for example, kindergarten classes 
of 50 pupils coming at different hours and having a three 
period day; all classes above the kindergarten limited to 
three hours of academic work; daily auditorium exercises 
of an hour, in groups of eight classes, for all grades above

rooms, and 4 rooms for the household and industrial arts, a total of 40 
that might be employed for old line instruction. Admittedly, the 4 house- 
hold and industrial arts rooms are not well suited to general class work, 
owing to poor lighting and ventilation, yet they are surely equal to many 
now used for regular work in conventional schools.

circulating as observers and helpers; an eight hour plant 
instruction day, which necessitates a double luncheon 
period—if these and other educational and social condi- 
tions are accepted, it is evident that the Emerson and 
Froebel schools can, as the schedule shows, accommodate 
60 classes, containing 2,300 pupils.’ But if any one of the 
above named major conditions is changed, if, for ex- 
ample, kindergarten classes consist of 4o pupils on a 
five and a half hour day; or if for all classes above the 
fourth grade four hours of academic work are prescribed; 
if the auditorium is somewhat more highly systematized, 
and if helpers and observers are reduced or eliminated— 
if any one or several of these changes in program are 
made, the estimated capacity of these plants is altered 
and in each instance is lowered. 
Although the particular schedule above mentioned 
shows that Froebel and Emerson can on the conditions 
there given each accommodate 2,300 pupils, it is ‘m- 
portant to note that 360 of these, or twelve classes, are 
of high school grade. The question arises: What is the 
elementary school capacity of these buildings under 
the new type of organization? Fortunately, in at- 
tempting to answer this question, the official esti- 
mate is based on number of classes and not directly 
on number of pupils. The proposed program require- 
ments for high school pupils—three hours of academic 
1See Table G of the Appendix.  
-P-A-G-E-107
  USE OF PLANT 67 
instruction and four of special work—are the same 
as for elementary pupils.! There would therefore be 
little difference between the accommodations required 
by twelve high school and by twelve elementary classes. 
Consequently, Emerson and Froebel could, with the pro- 
posed program, each care for sixty elementary classes 
even more easily than for forty-eight elementary and 
twelve high school classes. In that event, owing to the 
difference between elementary and high school instruc- 
tional needs, less highly specialized equipment would be 
required. There would also be a decided difference in the 
grade distribution of the sixty elementary classes. This 
would probably be for an ordinary elementary school 
approximately as follows: 
  6 kindergarten classesof sopupilseach . . . 300

other, it appears that Emerson and Froebel might 
accommodate 2,410 elementary pupils. But as the 
classes might easily distribute themselves differently, 
lowering this number by 100, no violence is done if 
the elementary school capacity, on the proposed pro- 
gram, of Emerson and Froebel is estimated at 60 classes 
and 2,300 pupils.’ 
USING ALL FACILITIES ALL THE TIME 
Even when the pupil capacity of Emerson and Froebel 
is estimated at 60 classes and 2,300 pupils, all the facili- 
ties of these buildings are not actually in use during the 
entire plant instruction day of eight hours, or during 
the entire pupil instruction day of seven hours. For 
example, at Froebel—and the same would be true of 
Emerson—the kindergarten and primary playroom, the 
auditorium, the gymnasiums, the swimming pools, the 
zoology, botany, physics and chemistry laboratories, 
the freehand drawing room, the mechanical drawing 
room, the sewing room, the manual training shop, in 
short, practically all the special facilities, are idle two 
hours daily or a fourth of the plant instruction day, and, 
besides, a few regular classrooms are also vacant one or 
two periods.” 
1As we proceed with the analysis of this official estimate, it should 
not be forgotten that we are dealing only with an estimate; the pro- 
posed program has never been given in all its details, nor has Emerson 
or Froebel ever had any such number of pupils.

  USE OF PLANT 69 
The reason is obvious. Regular or academic rooms 
can be kept going eight hours a day without requiring any 
academic teacher to teach more than six hours. There 
would merely have to be a few more teachers than thereare 
classrooms. In the case of an eight hour plant instruc- 
tion day, four academic teachers would use three different 
regular rooms, and in the case of a seven hour plant in- 
struction day, seven teachers would use six rooms. But 
it is impossible under the new type of organization, or 
under any other, for that matter, to keep the highly 
specialized facilities of Emerson and Froebel (such as the 
botany, zoology, physics and chemistry laboratories, art 
studios, cooking and manual training rooms) employed 
more than six hours. Such facilities require specialized 
teachers, who at most cannot give more than six hours of 
instruction daily, and as a rule there is only one specialist 
of each kind in a school plant. When the specialists 
have done their daily round of hours, specialized facili- 
ties, seldom adapted to academic work, lie idle the re- 
maining two hours of an eight hour plant instruction 
day, as there are no teachers available to use them.! 
Consequently six hours of daily use is probably all that 
can be gotten out of about a fourth of the facilities of 
a modern plant, varying with the requirements of the 
1The Gary authorities have heretofore met this difficulty in part by 
employing in practical shops workmen instead of teachers. However, in 
the program under discussion there are no provisions for specialized shop 
work such as tinsmithing; manual training dnly is provided; shoe making 
and plumbing are purely incidental. See Table G of the Appendix.  
-P-A-G-E-112
    7° THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
program. This, however, does not necessarily apply to 
the gymnasium or to the auditorium, unless the plant 
instruction day is eight hours; for in a school of size there 
are a number of physical training teachers and usnally 
more than one auditorium director; besides, these exer- 
cises are frequently in the hands of regular teachers. 
The natural thing, therefore, when operating a school 
under the departmental type of organization, would be 
to have a six hour instruction day for both building and 
pupils. Conditions would then be favorable to keeping 
all parts of the plant continuously employed, and the 
school, although under the new type of organization, 
would approximate the usual hours, beginning at 9 
o’clock and continuing until 4 o’clock, with an hour for 
luncheon. 
The particular program to which we referred calls, 
however, for a seven hour pupil instruction day. To 
provide this, in the face of the fact that highly specialized 
facilities can not be used for more than six hours, the 
plant instruction day is extended to eight hours; two 
luncheon periods are introduced, half of the children going 
to luncheon at each period; all special work is scheduled 
for the first three morning and the last three afternoon 
hours, leaving all special facilities idle during the two 
luncheon periods; and, finally, regular classrooms are 
used eight hours a day, being fully occupied during the 
two noon hours when only half of the student body is in 
the building at any one time.

  USE OF PLANT rE 
This appears at first thought to be an ingenious ar- 
rangement to give pupils a seven hour instruction day, 
increasing the daily use of ordinary classrooms, without 
adding to the size of the plant. Analysis of the arrange- 
ment dissipates this impression. 
In the first place, the pupil instruction day in a school 
operating under the new type of organization cannot be 
increased from six to seven hours without additional 
plant facilities. To illustrate: An instruction day of 
six hours would probably be divided three hours to aca- 
demic work and three to special activities. The three 
hours allotted to special activities would probably be 
apportioned as follows: 
(a) Kindergarten and first grades, two hours to play 
and one hour to other special activities; 
(b) Second to the sixth grades, one hour to physical 
training, one hour to auditorium, and one hour to other 
special activities; and 
(c) Seventh and eighth grades, a half hour to physical 
training, a half hour to auditorium, and two hours to 
other special activities. 
Under these program conditions, the building require- 
ments of a 60 class school are: (a) 30 standard classrooms, 
that is, enough to accommodate half of the school at 
one time in academic work; and (b) capacity in special 
facilities equivalent to the capacity of 30 standard class- 
rooms, that is, a capacity in special facilities sufficient 
to accommodate the other half of the school at one 
time; or a total capacity equivalent to the capacity of 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  72 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
60 standard classrooms. The special facilities would 
be apportioned about as follows: 
(a) Gymnasium capacity equivalent to 11% standard 
classrooms; 
(b) Auditorium capacity equivalent to 6% standard 
classrooms; and 
(c) Capacity in special facilities other than gymnasium 
and auditorium, such as nature study rooms, handwork 
rooms, cooking and manual training rooms, equivalent 
to 11 standard classrooms. 
We are aware, of course, that school facilities cannot 
be provided in broken units; we however retain the frac- 
tions in order to keep the relations mathematically exact 
for purposes of comparison.’ 
1The mathematics of these building requirements is simple. To ac- 
commodate 60 classes three hours daily in academic studies is equal 
to caring for 180 classes one hour. One standard classroom accommo- 
dates 6 classes for one hour daily, therefore to care for 180 classes will 
require 30 standard classrooms (180-+-6). 
To accommodate 16 kindergarten and first grade classes (the estimated 
number in a 60 class school—see page 67,) two hours daily in play, 
34 second to sixth grade classes one hour daily in physical training, and 
zo seventh and eighth grade classes a half hour daily is equal to 71 class 
instruction hours; hence, on a six hour building instruction day, would 
require gymnasium capacity equivalent to 11§ standard classrooms 
(71-6). 
To accommodate 34 second to sixth grade classes (the estimated num- 
ber in a 60 class school—see page 67) one hour daily in auditorium, and 
ro seventh and eighth grade classes a half hour daily, is equal to 39 class 
instruction hours; hence, would require auditorium capacity equivalent 
to 6% standard classrooms (39+-6). 
To accommodate in special activities other than gymnasium and audi-

  USE OF PLANT 73 
It is important to note that “equivalent capacity in 
special facilities” does not mean the same number of 
special as of regular rooms. The number of special 
rooms will probably be less, for, as we have seen, several 
classes can be assembled at one time in a single audito- 
rium or in a single gymnasium. Nor does it mean an 
equal amount of floor space. The space requirements 
of the several studies and activities differ. In some 
instances it takes more and in others less room to ac- 
commodate a standard sized class in a special activity 
than in an academic study. For example, cooking, 
manual training, and science, the instruction groups being 
ordinarily half of a full sized class, call for approximately 
double the space required by academic work, whereas 
auditorium requires only about a third as much. Ina 
word, we are dealing with equivalent capacity when a 
standard sized class is the unit of comparison. There- 
fore, the above requirements mean that apart from 
the number of special rooms and amount of floor space 
thus needed, the special facilities together must be suf- 
ficient to accommodate at one time 30 standard sized 
classes. 
On the other hand, when the pupil instruction day is 
seven hours for all grades, three hours would be allotted 
torium 16 kindergarten and first grade classes one hour daily, 34 second 
to sixth grade classes one hour daily, and 10 seventh and eighth grade 
classes two hours daily, is equal to 70 class instruction hours; hence, 
would require special facilities other than gymnasium and auditorium 
equivalent to the capacity of 11$ standard classrooms (70-+-6).

to academic work and four hours to special activities. 
The time for special activities would be apportioned 
about as follows: 
(a) Kindergarten and first grade, two hours to play 
and two hours to other special activities; 
(b) Second to fourth grades, two hours to physical 
training, one hour to auditorium, and one hour to other 
special activities; and 
(c) Fifth to eighth grades, one hour to physical train- 
ing, one hour to auditorium, and two hours to other spe- 
cial activities. 
Under these conditions, when the regular classrooms 
are used eight hours and special facilities six hours daily, 
the building requirements of a 60 class school are: 
(a) 22% regular rooms (60 X 3-+8); and 
(b) Special facilities equivalent to the capacity of 40 
standard classrooms, or a total capacity equivalent to 
the capacity of 62} (40+ 224) standard classrooms.1_ The 
special facilities would be apportioned approximately as 
follows: 
(a) Gymnasium capacity equivalent to 163 standard 
classrooms; 
(b) Auditorium capacity equivalent to 7% standard 
classrooms; and 
1It is recognized that the instruction day for kindergarten and the first 
grade is usually shorter than for the other grades. Even Gary does not 
contemplate a seven hour instruction day for the kindergarten and first 
primary, and we hold to a seven hour instruction day for them in order 
to keep the comparison exact.
-P-A-G-E-117

(c) Capacity in special facilities, other than gymna- 
sium and auditorium, equivalent to 16$ standard class- 
rooms. 
The change from a six to a seven hour pupil instruc- 
tion day in a school under the departmental type of or- 
ganization, even though regular rooms are employed 
eight hours a day, requires, it will be noted, a net increase 
in plant facilities equivalent to the capacity of 2} class- 
rooms, or an increase of 4 per cent. But this may not be 
the most important difference. The number of regular 
rooms is reduced from 30 to 22% and the special facilities 
are increased from the equivalent of 30 to the equivalent 
of 4o standard classrooms. This alters radically the 
character of the facilities to be provided and the interior 
structure of the plant, and raises the question of the rela- 
tive cost of an equal capacity in regular and special 
rooms. Let this be as it may, it suffices for the present 
to note that, even in a plant operating under the new 
type of organization, lengthening the pupil instruction 
day from six to seven hours cannot be accomplished by a 
mere administrative arrangement which permits the 
use of regular rooms eight hours a day; to do it requires 
additional building facilities. 
In the second place, the double luncheon period, the 
center of this administrative arrangement, is open to 
question. It brings the school into direct conflict 
with domestic arrangements and habits, as it interrupts 
and makes irregular the midday meal in families with 
children, who, belonging to different classes, go home to 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  76 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
luncheon at different hours. It is undesirable so to or- 
ganize the school that it interferes unduly, as does the 
double luncheon period, with the convenience of the 
family; in our opinion such an arrangement can hardly be 
acceptable to the home, whatever school economies may 
be achieved thereby. Let us consider what these econo- 
mies amount to. 
Any use of regular rooms in excess of seven hours when 
the pupil instruction day is seven hours would seem to be 
aclear economic gain. But the use of regular rooms eight 
hours, when special facilities can only be employed six,! 
increases the proportion of special to regular rooms. For 
example, under the above program conditions, special 
facilities used six hours must be provided in sufficient 
quantity to care during four hours daily for all the 
classes that regular rooms used eight hours can accom- 
modate three hours a day. Obviously, the greater the 
proportion of special facilities to regular rooms, the 
greater the proportion of the entire school plant idle 
after six hours of service. For this reason, when the 
pupil instruction day is seven hours, the net gain from an 
eight hour use of regular rooms and the double luncheon 
period comes to nothing. 
1See pages 68-70. Moreover, it should be kept in mind that in order to 
use regular rooms eight hours a day it is necessary to schedule all special 
work the first three hours cf the morning and the last three hours of the 
afternoon, thus leaving all special facilities idle the two midday periods. 
Otherwise, with half of the school at luncheon each of these periods, there 
would not be pupils available to fill the regular rooms. See Table G of 
the Appendix.

  USE OF PLANT 7 
To illustrate: Under the above program conditions 
(page 73), when the pupil instruction day and the day for 
regular rooms are seven hours, the building require- 
ments! of a 60 class school are: 
(a) 25% regular rooms; and 
(b) Special facilities equal to the capacity of 363% 
ordinary rooms, or a total capacity equivalent to 627%, 
standard classrooms. The special facilities would be 
apportioned about as follows: 
(a) Gymnasium capacity equivalent to 13$ standard 
classrooms; 
(b) Auditorium capacity equivalent to 6} standard 
classrooms; and 
(c) Capacity in special facilities, other than gymmna- 
sium and auditorium, equivalent to 164 standard class- 
rooms.” 
Therefore, when, in a school operating under the new 
1For method of computation, see note page 72. It should, -however, 
be observed that when the plant instruction day is seven hours, gymna- 
sium and auditorium may be used seven hours daily. 
2To accommodate 16 kindergarten and first grade classes in other than 
gymnasium and auditorium two hours daily; 21 second to fourth grade 
classes one hour; and 23 fifth to eighth grade classes two hours, is equal 
to 99 class instruction hours. Hence, there will be required a capacity 
in special facilities other than gymnasium and auditorium equivalent 
to the capacity of 144 standard classrooms (99-7). But such facilities 
cannot ordinarily be used in excess of six hours. Therefore, that there 
may be available each hour of the seven hour school day a capacity 
in special facilities other than auditorium and gymnasium equal to 144 
standard classrooms, there must be provided a capacity equivalent to 
164 standard classrooms, thus allowing for 4 of such facilities being idle

type of organization and having a seven hour pupil in- 
struction day, regular rooms are used seven instead of 
eight hours a day, the requirements of a 60 class school 
under given program conditions are reduced from a total 
capacity! equivalent to 624 to a capacity equivalent to 
6235, standard classrooms.? The reduction is probably 
even greater, for the double luncheon period and the 
eight hour use of ordinary rooms permit no use of special 
facilities for other purposes, as they are fully occupied 
six hours of the day and are ordinarily not needed during 
the two noon hours. In contrast, when regular rooms 
are in use seven hours, it is possible to make occasional 
use throughout the school day of some of the vacant 
special facilities for regular instruction, and this might 
easily add further to the economic advantage of the single 
luncheon period and seven hour day. Where different 
kinds of facilities are not available in proper proportion 
each to, the other, the double luncheon period and eight 
hour use of regular rooms may be tolerated as a temporary 
makeshift, but it cannot be defended on the basis of 
either economy or more intensive use of plant; it is, more- 
over, not an essential feature of the departmental organ- 
ization. 
But even the departmental organization of a school, on 
the basis of a seven hour pupil instruction day and a 
seven hour daily use of regular rooms, does not provide 
See page 74. 
*These mathematical relations hold approximately for schools of all 
sizes large enough to accommodate an extended program.
-P-A-G-E-123
  USE OF PLANT 79 
for continuous employment of all facilities. One seventh 
of all special facilities, other than auditorium and gym- 
nasium, which constitute more than a fourth of the entire 
plant, will be idle practically all the time. There are, be- 
sides, certain other facilities, particularly outside equip- 
ment, that will be unused from a half to two thirds of the 
entire school year. For example, when from time to time 
children are at work in the school gardens, nature study 
rooms and botany laboratories are likely to be empty; 
when children are on the playgrounds, gymnasiums 
and swimming pools are likely to be unoccupied, and vice 
versa. When special auditorium exercises take place 
outside the regular auditorium period, regular rooms are 
vacant, and so on. 
Obviously, the new type of organization, when the 
school day is in excess of six hours, is not capable of 
keeping all school facilities in full use every hour of the 
school day. Undoubtedly, it possesses advantages over 
the old type of organization in semimodern plants, for 
in such plants, under the old organization, there is in- 
evitable waste in connection with regular classrooms, and 
all special facilities, such as auditorium, gymnasium, 
cooking and manual training rooms. But whatever the 
length of the school day, there is a certain amount of 
waste even under the new type of organization, from 
failure to use the plant uninterruptedly, because the 
different kinds of facilities are not provided in proper 
proportion to one another, or because of peculiarities in

the proposed program, or unusual makeup and grade 
distribution of the classes. The economic loss will cer- 
tainly be greater in a school so organized than in a con- 
ventional school, and might even prove not less than in a 
semimodern school operating under the classroom type 
of organization, unless a high type of administrative 
talent is employed. Even then it is doubtful whether a 
plant so operated can be utilized ordinarily at more than 
95 per cent. of its maximum capacity, if the experience 
of a well administered high school similarly organized 
is any criterion. The situation may therefore be sum- 
marized as follows: A school plant with modern features 
‘cannot possibly be utilized up to 100 per cent. of its actual 
physical capacity. Under the new type of organization 
it can, however, be used more steadily and effectually 
than under the conventional organization, but these 
possibilities cannot be realized without unusual adminis- 
trative skill. 
UTILIZING OUTSIDE FACILITIES 
It is interesting to note in this connection that the new 
type of organization permits the use of outside facilities. 
In some of the schools of Gary pupils leave the building 
at fixed intervals for religious or library instruction and 
even for physical training. For example, at Jefferson 
they go to the public library, and to the Y. M. C. A. 
for physical training and competitive games. If it is 
regarded as desirable to place school children in other 
institutions for a part of the school day and thus to 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  USE OF PLANT 81 
take advantage of the resources of other child welfare 
agencies, it becomes possible to increase the number of 
children the schools can care for. At Gary, however, 
these outside activities are almost always scheduled for 
the period or periods when the children would otherwise 
be in the gymnasium or at play; consequently, with the 
possible exception of Jefferson, this outside work has not 
affected the number of pupils the several buildings have 
been able to accommodate. 
GRADE GROUPINGS AND SIZE OF PLANT 
The foregoing considerations raise to new prominence 
the questions: What are the proper divisions or grade 
groupings in a system of free public schools and what is 
the most desirable size of an elementary school plant? 
These questions are of great practical importance, be- 
cause elementary schools can not ordinarily have enough 
seventh and eighth grade pupils to keep in constant 
use the special facilities required by an extended and di- 
versified program. 
To illustrate: A seventh grade program may offer a half 
year in botany and a half year in zoology, and an eighth 
grade program similar periods in physics and chemistry. 
If highly specialized facilities are furnished, as at Froebel 
and Emerson, and the instruction groupsare half of astand- 
ard sized class, six seventh and six eighth grade classes are 
needed to keep them going continuously. If, on the 
other hand, there are combination laboratories, one for 
botany and zoology, and one for physics and chemistry, 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  82 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
three full sized classes will be needed in each of these 
grades. Similarly, a program may provide at least a 
year’s work in cooking for girls. This may be distrib- 
uted, half to the seventh and half to the eighth grade, or 
all to the eighth grade. In either case, to keep a single 
cooking room and teacher engaged six hours a day, when 
the instruction groups are half of a standard sized class, 
requires the girls from six full sized classes. The problem 
appears in its acute form when opportunity is offered 
such pupils to participate in a variety of specialized 
industrial activities. For example, the Emerson school 
in 1915-16 provided forge and foundry as well as cabinet 
and woodturning shops. These arts appeal primarily to 
boys who make up less than half of all upper grade 
classes. Therefore, as each shop can accommodate six 
half classes a day, to keep these four shops employed, 
provided all boys take industrial work a period a day 
throughout the seventh and eighth years, would require 
not less than 12 seventh and 12 eighth grade classes. 
There are, however, only 7 seventh grade and 5 eighth 
grade classes in all the schools of Gary, which points to 
the economic impossibility of offering too much variety 
in specialized industrial opportunities in an ordinary ele- 
mentary school. 
Gary has attempted to solve the problem by combining 
elementary and high schools, and by using the same 
specialized facilities for the instruction of upper grade, 
even lower grade, and high school pupils. There is 
obviously a sharp limit to the number of high schools
-P-A-G-E-127
  USE OF PLANT 83 
that can be established in conjunction with elementary 
schools, for no city can possibly need as many high 
schools as elementary schools. Moreover, the specialized 
facilities required by an up-to-date high school are dif- 
ferent from those required by seventh and eighth grade 
instruction and are as far above the needs of the seventh 
and eighth grades as the facilities they require are dif- 
ferent from and above the needs of the intermediate and 
primary grades. The most general special facilities, 
such as handwork and drawing rooms, and nature study 
rooms, suffice for grades one to six, and it is only the 
high school that requires highly specialized equipment 
such as separate art studios and separate science lab- 
oratories. Therefore, to be compelled to use with in- 
termediate and primary pupils facilities appropriate 
to the seventh and eighth grades, or to use high school 
equipment with seventh and eighth year pupils, inevit- 
ably involves a certain amount of waste. 
The first step toward the solution of the problem will 
compel, we believe, a new grade grouping within the 
public schools. The junior high school movement has 
already pretty clearly indicated the nature of the realign- 
ment needed, and it should occasion no surprise that the 
requirements of the junior high school, itself an attempt 
to modernize the seventh and eighth grades, should coin- 
cide with the requirements of an expanding program for 
all grades. The arrangement most favorable to the 
development of modern programs and to the full use of 
all facilities each hour of the school day is, we believe,
-P-A-G-E-128
  84 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
approximately as follows: elementary school, grades one 
to six; junior high school, grades seven to nine; and 
senior high school, grades ten to twelve; that is, the six- 
three-three plan of organization. In large cities, there 
would be separate buildings for the junior and for the 
senior high schools. In cities the size of Gary, the junior 
and the senior high schools might well occupy the same 
building, while in small cities, a single building would 
suffice for all three schools. 
The second step involves the erection of plants designed 
to operate specific programs and to accommodate a given 
number of classes. A conventional program can be 
given about as well in a twelve room plant as in a twenty- 
four or a forty-eight room building. Economically, 
there is little to choose. In fact, aside from the distance 
children must go, there are only two questions of im- 
portance to consider: How large can a plant be without 
depriving the principal of that intimate knowledge and 
contact essential to the achievement of satisfactory re- 
sults, and how small can a plant be without interfering 
with proper pupil grading? On these questions opinions 
and practices differ widely. 
An extended and diversified program alters entirely 
the situation. To operate it at all the rooms must be of 
different kinds and to do this economically these must be 
in proper proportion to one another. Here is then a real 
criterion. The working size of a building can not be 
increased merely by adding a number of regular rooms. 
Due respect for economy forbids that gymnasium or <7

auditorium or shops have a daily capacity of forty classes, 
while other facilities provide for only half as many. To 
be sure, the number of children to be housed, their 
convenience and best interests determine the number of 
plants to be erected; but the number of classes to be 
accommodated in any given building, or its size, as well 
as the character of and relations between its facilities, 
must be determined by the requirements of the program 
to be followed. Hence, the starting point as well as the 
final basis of decision in the erection of a new plant is the 
program to be offered. This involves deciding by 
grades on the regular studies and special activities to be 
included; on the length of the school day, on the division 
of the school day among the different kinds of work, 
on the allotment of time to each of the special activities, 
and on the extent to which the proposed special activities 
require general or highly specialized facilities, on thelength 
to which departmentalization is to be carried, and on the 
size of the instructional groups. When plants are thus 
built around a given program and plan of organization, 
it will be necessary, we believe, in order to provide at a 
minimum cost a broad, varied, and rich course of study, to 
make schools larger than is common at present; but they 
will not necessarily need to be so large as the Emerson 
and Froebel schools. 
While the larger plant provides the more favorable 
conditions, the new type of organization may be employed 
in schools of almost any size, as the experience of Gary 
shows. For example, at the Clarke school, which has 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  86 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
only two rooms, each teacher is responsible for a room and 
yet the teachers as well as the children circulate freely. 
They come together for general or auditorium exercises 
now in one room and now in the other. One teacher 
takes most of the arithmetic, history, and physiology; 
the other, most of the reading and geography, and so on, 
according to the special interest, preparation, and skill of 
the two teachers. The 24th Avenue school has seven 
teachers, with classes ranging from the kindergarten 
to the second grade. Here one teacher has the play and 
physical training, and another, the literature, music, 
nature study, and gardening. The Glen Park school, 
with eight teachers and all grades, shows a further divi- 
sion of work. One teacher does the play and physical 
training, another has charge of the auditorium, music, 
and expression, and there is also a separate teacher for 
manual training, handwork, and mechanical drawing, and 
for cooking, nature study, and gardening. At Beveridge, 
a school with fourteen teachers, departmentalization is 
still more complete. Manual training, cooking, hand- 
work and drawing, nature study, music and auditorium, 
and play and physical training each have special teach- 
ers. 
LENGTH OF THE SCHOOL DAY 
Finally, it is desirable to call attention to the fact that 
the new type of organization is not bound up with a seven 
hour instruction day. With the new type of organiza- 
See Table C of the Appendix.
-P-A-G-E-133
USE OF PLANT 87 
tion, as with the old, the school day may be of any desired 
length. To be sure, an extended and diversified pro- 
gram requires more time than a narrow, conventional pro- 
gram; but not necessarily seven hours. For example, by 
the simple expedient of eliminating the auditorium the 
Gary program could be reduced to six hours. For cer- 
tain congested and foreign sections of Gary there are 
convincing reasons why the instruction day should be 
seven hours. But under other living and social conditions 
there may be objections to a school day in excess of six 
hours. 
SUMMARY 
To summarize: The number of pupils a plant will ac- 
commodate under the new or departmental type of or- 
ganization is determined by the requirements of the pro- 
gram followed and will vary with these requirements. 
With a rich and varied program, the pupil capacity 
of a modern plant will be greater. under the new type of 
organization than under the classroom type of organiza- 
tion, as it permits the maximum use of both regular and 
special teachers and of all facilities. 
Special facilities cannot ordinarily be kept in use more 
than six hours a day whatever the type of organization, 
but the loss in a modern plant under the new type of 
organization, when the program is rich and varied, will 
never be as great as it would be under the old type of 
organization. « 
Conditions are most favorable under the new type of 
organization when the instruction day is six hours, when  
-P-A-G-E-134
  88 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
the grade groupings are on the six-three-three plan, and 
when plants are erected in view of the requirements of 
particular programs and for the accommodation of a 
given number of classes. 
While a large plant offers the most favorable field of 
operation, the new type of organization may be employed 
within limits in a school of any size having more than 
one teacher.

  VI. SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION 
HE results achieved at Gary in respect both to 
| education and cost depend no less than in 
other systems upon the effectiveness of the ad- 
ministration and supervision. 
SUPERVISION 
The administrative and supervisory staff of the Gary 
schools consists of a superintendent, an assistant super- 
intendent (who is also director of night schools and super- 
visor of the upper grades of elementary day schools), 
an assistant superintendent in charge of kindergarten 
and primary grades, a supervisor of handwriting, of 
physical education, and of the industrial arts, certain 
heads of high school departments theoretically respon- 
sible for the supervision of their subjects throughout the 
system, and school principals. With the exception of 
heads of departments and school principals, these officers 
are charged with the responsibilities commonly associated 
with their respective titles and positions. 
1A teacher at Froebel who gave a considerable amount of his time to 
advising and assigning pupils to industrial work is not included in this 
enumeration.

GENERAL SUPERVISION 
The superintendent of schools and his two chief as- 
sistants may be characterized as general supervisors, since 
their control is exercised not over a particular subject or a 
particular school, but over the entire system. It is not 
easy to describe their activities, nor is it easy to evaluate 
their work. The theory of supervision, which accords 
with the practice observed, can be best expressed by 
saying that the general supervisory staff develops a plan 
of organization, making suggestions and outlining ideals 
to be attained, and then leaves the other members of 
the school staff to realize these aims in their own way. 
The superintendent participates in the actual organiza- 
tion of certain phases of the work, such, for example, as 
transition classes between the kindergarten and first 
grade, and all school programs are submitted to him for re- 
view and approval. Three or four times a year he holds 
general teachers’ meetings on Saturday afternoons for the 
discussion of policies and methods of procedure, but rou- 
tine matters occupy a conspicuous place at such gatherings. 
Occasionally, he announces special meetings, but these 
are, as a rule, given over to topics of particular interest 
to the teachers themselves, such as the length of the 
instruction day and salary schedules. Informal confer- 
ences are held at long intervals with supervisors, princi- 
pals, and heads of departments, and now and then a 
teacher calls at the office, but seldom for any other pur- 
pose than to adjust some personal matter. From time to
-P-A-G-E-137
  SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION _ o1 
time, questions of repairs, rearrangement of classrooms, 
additions to buildings, and improvements to grounds, take 
the superintendent into the schools for an hour or two 
at a time, and occasionally he observes classroom work. 
Similarly, the two assistant superintendents hold meet- 
ings with the particular teachers under their direction, the 
one supervising the upper and the other the kindergarten 
and primary grades. The schools are dismissed an hour 
earlier to permit teachers to attend. General problems of 
interest to the particular grades receive some attention, but 
the time is mostly consumed with details of instruction 
and routine in management. The assistant superintend- 
ents also visit classes, observe the instruction, advise with 
the teachers, and finally grade them, as is required by the 
Indiana law. They assemble reports on children’s work, 
determine whether or not they shall be promoted, over- 
see the makeup of their daily schedules, and advise in the 
organization of classes. In fact, the assistant super- 
intendent of the kindergarten and primary grades gives 
a good part of her time to studying individual needs and 
to seeing that children are properly classified. Never- 
theless, on the whole, there is too little supervisory effort 
to organize the practices—many of them recent—for the 
achievement of the proposed aims of the Gary schools, 
too little close supervision to see whether the classroom 
work makes good the theories and aims adopted, and too 
little central endeavor to determine the quality of the 
pupils’ performances. In a word, the general supervision 
is inadequate in amount and ineffective in its results. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  92 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
There is no good reason why this should be so. Three 
general supervisors, with the assistance of three special 
supervisors,! should be able to give unity of purpose and 
consistency of effort to a system having less than 150 
teachers and less than 6,000 pupils. Nor is it because 
the outlay for supervision is meager. The combined 
salaries for 1915-1916 of the general supervisors, charge- 
able to the regular day schools, amounted to $8,925, and 
of the three special supervisors, to $3,650, a total of 
$12,575.” In truth, the situation raises an interesting 
question: What are the possibilities, what should be the 
practice, and what should be the character of supervi- 
sion in a school or school system experimenting with 
program and organization? It is impossible to answer 
‘these questions offhand. It is, however, apparent that 
the more complicated and novel the system, the greater 
the need of central direction, the greater the need of 
unity of policy, and the closer the scrutiny with which 
results should be observed. Schools like Emerson and 
Froebel are more complex both in program and in or- 
ganization than the conventional school, and hence there 
is every reason to believe that they require rather more 
1To be exact, there are two and one third general supervisors, counting 
the superintendent, as one assistant superintendent gives only one third 
of his time to the day schools. On the other hand, the teacher at Froe- 
bel mentioned in the footnote on page 89 is not included among the 
special supervisors. It is to be noted also that the industrial super- 
visor has charge of repairs, but as this repair work is supposed to be 
educational, we consider his entire time as being given to supervision.

than less the customary amount of administrative and 
supervisory direction and control, always provided, be it 
understood, that it is supervision of the right kind. 
Obviously, there is a real danger of the wrong kind of 
supervision in a school that is attempting tasks requiring 
new and resourceful adjustments, as would be the case if 
the supervisors should lack sympathy with the extension 
and enrichment of the curriculum and the type of organ- 
ization needed for these purposes. The success of a more 
or less novel educational enterprise depends on vision, 
initiative, and a certain freedom. But freedom is not 
license. Genuine experimentation is exacting. While, 
therefore, the supervision required in a school system 
which is itself to a degree experimental differs from that 
needed in schools working in conventional ways for con- 
ventional results, there is certainly the very greatest 
need in the former of supervisors of deep insight and lib- 
eral sympathies, who will assist teachers to appreciate 
the ideals back of modern education as well as to grasp 
clearly the specific aims which they are to realize, who 
will direct them in developing instructional materials 
and teaching methods appropriate to the realization of 
their aims, and assist them in measuring and evaluating 
the products of their classroom work by the sound and 
inevitable standards of practical life. 
THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
The Gary school principal has little to do with the 
educational side of his school. He organizes it in con-
-P-A-G-E-142
94 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
sultation with the superintendent and assistant superin- 
tendents, looks after the building and grounds, meets 
parents, handles special attendance and discipline cases, 
orders books and supplies, collects reports from teachers, 
hires and supervises the janitorial force, and makes re- 
ports to the superintendent; he also arranges the pro- 
grams of teachers and supplies substitutes, holds weekly 
teachers’ meetings after school hours to consider questions 
of discipline, attendance, and school management, and 
occasionally visits classes, but he has no responsibility 
for the quality of the teaching. Records of enrollment, 
of promotion, and of scholarship come to his office, but 
the responsibility for what pupils do and for their 
promotion belongs to the teachers and general super- 
visors. In short, the principal is an administrative 
officer. Our observations and our investigations of the 
quality of the instruction indicate the need of a more 
detailed and intimate type of educational control, such 
as the best school principals of other systems exercise. 
The principal at Gary should undoubtedly be the head 
of his school, even if the business management has to be 
delegated. For general supervisors who go from school 
to school are rarely intimate enough with the needs and 
abilities of particular children to advise wisely as to their 
programs or their promotion, nor do they, as a rule, know 
individual teachers well enough to be able to offer the 
helpful criticism and suggestions which make for the 
highest degree of efficiency in a teaching corps. 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION 95 
SUPERVISORS OF SPECIAL SUBJECTS 
Special supervisors have to do with given branches of 
instruction only; the handwriting supervisor, for exam- 
ple, with handwriting. This particular special supervisor 
at Gary corresponds, however, more nearly to what is 
known in other systems as a special teacher. He goes 
from building to building and from room to room actually 
teaching classes, particularly of the upper grades; he 
counsels teachers, gives suggestions, and at long intervals 
brings them together for conference. 
The supervisor of physical training—the latest addi- 
tion to the supervisory staff—works in much the same 
way. Through observing teachers at work, personal in- 
terviews, printed directions, occasional conferences with 
groups, and now and then a place on the program of a 
general meeting, he keeps in touch with the play and 
physical training instructors in the larger plants and even 
gives some direction to the work undertaken in the small 
schools by teachers who have had little or no special 
training. Under his oversight, considerable has already 
been accomplished in organized play, in interscholastic 
athletics, and other recreational activities. 
The supervisor of the household and industrial arts 
1The exact status of this supervisor isan open question. Officially he 
is ranked as a teacher. We rank him as a special supervisor, because 
he has no class assignments on the school program, and because he gave 
all his time to supervision during the period of our study of physical 
training.
-P-A-G-E-144
  96 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
superintends also the repair work of the entire system’ 
and oversees some new construction. During the period 
of the field work of the survey, repairs, together with 
moving pictures, consumed most of his energies, and there 
is little reason to believe that he ever has much time for 
his strictly supervisory duties. To be sure, he is in and 
out of the several shops and even cooking and sewing 
rooms almost daily; he knows precisely what engages 
each shop and is thus able to give a certain unity and di- 
rection to the work. He also meets with the shopmen 
two or three times a year for an evening’s discussion of 
their particular educational problems, but at most, there 
is little direct educational supervision of the practical 
work for boys and even less of that for girls. 
The heads of high school departments, particularly 
those at the Emerson school, feel a certain responsibil- 
ity for the teaching of their subjects in all grades and 
throughout the system. There is, however, no evidence 
that this mode of supervision is more than a theory. The 
head of the English department at Emerson and the 
physics teacher in the same school are, to be sure, keenly 
interested and have some influence in their respective 
fields, but teachers work, for the most part, independ- 
ently of such control. 
ADMINISTRATION 
Superintendents and school principals handling the 
new type of elementary organization have to deal with 
practically the same administrative problems as admin-’
-P-A-G-E-145
  SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION 97 
istrators of conventional systems, but a number of these 
problems have taken on new and more complex forms, 
which make the administration of such an elementary 
school comparable in difficulty with the administration 
of a modern high school. 
Among these problems are the storage of children’s 
wraps and instructional supplies, the equipment of rooms 
occupied by children of different grades and ages, dis- 
cipline growing out of the frequent passage of classes 
from room to room, types of records and reports needed 
when children are not under the control of one teacher, 
and finally program making. 
STORAGE FACILITIES 
Storage space for the books and wraps of children is 
provided at Gary by means of lockers installed in the hall- 
ways and in some of the shops. Attractive cupboards 
hold the textbooks and materials used in academic in- 
struction, and such supplies as the special activities re- 
quire are kept in the special rooms. As far as possible, 
children are assigned lockers on the same floor and near 
the rooms where they will be the last period before lunch- 
eon and the last period in the afternoon. 
SCHOOL FURNITURE 
A somewhat more difficult task is that of providing 
furniture of suitable size, when c asses with children of 
different ages and grades use the same room. This 
problem has not been successfully solved at Gary. Very
-P-A-G-E-146
  98 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
often the feet of children seated at desks or on chairs do 
not reach the floor.!| Special rooms are equipped with 
furniture of one size only, and, although there are usually 
desks of two or three different sizes in regular rooms, 
sufficient care is not exercised to schedule classes so as 
to use to the best advantage equipment of the sizes pro- 
vided. The difficulty is by no means insurmountable, 
at least in fairly large schools. Rooms can be properly 
furnished and devoted to a single grade group; for ex- 
ample a single regular room can be used by second 
grade classes for academic work the whole day. A large 
school, providing the more general equipment for the 
household and industrial arts, as the Passaic school men- 
tioned above, will need more than one special room for 
this work. Hence, equipment can be varied so that the 
children of the first two grades will use one set, the third 
and fourth another set, and the fifth and sixth still an- 
other set. Similarly, special rooms for the seventh 
and eighth grades can easily be supplied with chairs or 
stools of two or three different sizes. 
SCHOOL DISCIPLINE 
Under the new type of organization, practically the 
whole school appears in the corridors at the same time 
and goes from one part of the building to another not less 
than four times a day. For the sake of promptness and 
order all classes should move at the same moment. Other 
devices may be employed, but for satisfactory results a   
1See illustration opposite page too.
-P-A-G-E-147
  SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION 99 
pneumatic clock and a full set of electric signals are es- 
sential. This corridor life gives rise to new problems in 
conduct and in discipline. In certain of the Gary 
schools, the corridor discipline, though varying, is not 
everywhere or always satisfactory; but this is a local 
matter depending on the principal. No unprecedented 
or novel difficulty is presented, except perhaps the ex- 
tension to elementary pupils of a type of self control al- 
ready common with older pupils. An easy, natural, but 
self controlled mode of deportment is desirable. Gary 
indeed aims to secure just this and often does, but super- 
vision is in some places perhaps somewhat too lax. 
RECORDS AND REPORTS 
The departmentalized elementary school, even more 
than the conventional school, requires an adequate sys- 
tem of records and reports. Not the least difficult of 
these to devise and to keep is the record of attendance. 
At the time of the survey, the Gary procedure in record- 
ing attendance and absence was as follows: At the be- 
ginning of the term, each pupil takes his daily program 
card to the proper class teacher, who initials the card 
for the particular period for which the pupil is registered 
with him, and enters the pupil’s name on his class roll. 
At each class meeting, the teacher calls the roll and a 
pupil selected for the purpose writes on an absence slip 
the names of all pupils not present, designating the room 
and period. These absence slips are collected at the last 
hour of the day and taken in charge next morning by the   
     
-P-A-G-E-148
  100 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
“clearing house,”’ a group of pupils who, under the direc- 
tion of a teacher, make up the attendance record of the 
school for the preceding day, copy on a separate slip the 
names of all pupils absent belonging to each register 
teacher, and deposit these with the proper teachers. 
Other pupils, serving as helpers, usually transfer these 
reports for the register teacher to the permanent attend- 
ance records of the particular group for which the given 
register teacher is responsible; children not reported ab- 
sent are marked present. 
Children may well profit by such responsibility and 
by engaging in such work, but the records kept in 
this way are strikingly incomplete, as evidenced by 
Table [X,1 which shows for each period of a given day for 
both Emerson and Froebel schools the number of pupils 
scheduled, the number of pupils actually present and ac- 
counted for, and the number not accounted for. Thus, 
at the Emerson school as many as 34 pupils are unac- 
counted for during one period, and at Froebel the number 
varies at given periods from a few to several hundred. 
The discrepancy between the number of children sched- 
uled for a particular period and the number present by 
actual count, when allowance is made for those reported 
absent and excused, can only be explained on the basis 
of failure to keep complete records, if not to control at- 
tendance. The discrepancy at Emerson is small and 
yet sufficiently large to indicate laxity. At Froebel, the 
conditions approach demoralization.

PROGRAM MAKING 
In a conventional school, program making is a simple 
matter. The program for each class of a given grade is 
practically fixed by the course of study; it remains for 
the class teacher to arrange the order of daily exercises 
so that there is a proper balance between the easy and the 
difficult. Under the departmental type of organization, 
program making is peculiarly the work of the principal 
and presents at once great opportunities and great diffi- 
culties. Upon the skill exercised in devising and dove- 
tailing the several class schedules depends the use 
made of the plant and its facilities. Further, there are 
great educational possibilities in adapting the work of the 
school to particular class and individual needs. Class 
and individual] differences may within limits be taken into 
account; the hours of some specially needed type of work 
may be increased, and opportunity may be given for 
double promotion or for specialization. The extent to 
which classes and individuals may be put where they can 
work to the best advantage depends, of course, on the 
breadth of the program, the building facilities, and the 
number of classes in each grade and subject. 
To take full advantage of an extended and diversified 
program in a departmentalized school it is necessary 
for the principal to have in his office for guidance a 
carefully kept cumulative record card showing each pu- 
pil’s attendance, scholarship, and previous work in every 
regular and special subject. Gary provides such a
-P-A-G-E-153
SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION 103 
form in the possession of the register teacher, but the 
record is poorly kept. It is also necessary for the prin- 
cipal in making up the pupil’s program for a given year 
and grade to have in mind the child’s entire school career. 
Gary does not realize the possibilities of its program, 
as the study of a single Froebel class (No. 44, 7A) illus- 
trates. This class contained many weak pupils in un- 
questionable need of individual consideration and atten- 
tion. Its official spring program was as follows: 
8:15 Gymnasium (play) or library 
9:15 Music 
10:15 Arithmetic 
11:15 English 
12:15 Luncheon 
a:15 Auditorium 
2:15 Shop (boys); Cooking or sewing (girls) 
3:15 United States history’ 
In a conventional system each of the 31 pupils of the 
class would take the above studies at the designated 
period. At Gary the entire 31 pupils recited together in 
a single class—arithmetic—at the scheduled time. 
(Table X.?) Only two other subjects—gymnasium and 
English—claimed all members, but in neither of these 
branches were they all in the same class. Twenty-three 
took no music, seven no history, and four no auditorium. 
These variations might well represent real educational

work was changed to United States history.

gains. However, as we point out in the next paragraph, 
they are not adjustments to serve the interests of par- 
ticular pupils or to secure their regular advancement, 
but merely chance arrangements, the product of loose 
administration and supervision. 
The most surprising variations occur in the 9:15 and 
2:15 periods. Atg:15 the class is scheduled for music. At 
that time thirteen went tothe gymnasium, seven had music, 
one arithmetic, two shop, six cooking or sewing, and two 
drawing. At 2:15 boys are supposed to be in shop and 
girls in cooking or sewing. Actually, eight went to 
gymnasium or library, one to music, seven to shop, nine 
to cooking or sewing, five to drawing, and one to history. 
Again, the official program calls for only one period a day 
in each of the several studies; and yet fourteen pupils 
took two hours of gymnasium or library and two took 
three hours. Twelve pupils did double and one treble 
duty in practical work. (Table XI'.) All told, there 
were thus not less than fifty-four deviations from the 
official class program, but only three were to afford addi- 
tional academic instruction—one in arithmetic and two 
in English. 
All persons concerned—teachers, principal, and chil- 
dren—were questioned about these changes. The prin- 
cipal, whose written endorsement is required, had no 
recollection of the reasons for them and no record of 
them. Although the pupil’s Program Card reads, “‘No 
dropping of class nor change of program will be permitted

without the written consent of the assistant superintend- 
ent,” the children had not consulted this official. A 
teacher employed to advise with children about their prac- 
tical work knew nothing about these departures. Reg- 
ister teachers,! supposed to have on file for each change 
“Permission to Change Class” slips, had barely a half 
dozen of them—not one completely executed—and were, 
therefore, almost wholly unaware of what had happened. 
The fact is, that in a few instances, the regular teachers, 
on their own authority, excused pupils from their classes, 
but in most instances children dropped what they did 
not want and elected what they wanted,' provided they 
could get it, without consulting anybody. Prolonged

inquiry showed clearly that with five or six exceptions 
all these changes were the result of childish caprice ex- 
ercised without restraint. 
Nor does class 44 stand alone. Out of eleven addi- 
tional Froebel and Emerson classes similarly tabulated, in 
six there was not a single pupil taking double work in any 
of the regular studies, and in the remaining five classes, not 
more than a single pupil in any one of them. In no class 
were there as many deviations from the official program 
in special work as in class 44. Still, such deviations as 
there were, were rarely educational adjustments; they 
were due mostly to the child’s own choice, to the organi- 
zation of the school at the time, and to the special facili- 
ties available. Nevertheless, the flexible class program 
might easily be made a material factor in the develop- 
ment and regular advancement of pupils, in academic 
as well as special activities. But, obviously, no little 
judgment, knowledge, and sympathy are required for 
efficient administration. Finally, an intelligent and con- 
sistent policy cannot be pursued in the absence of com- 
plete and accurate individual records. 
SUMMARY 
Supervision in schools like Emerson and Froebel is 
clearly more difficult than in conventional schools. The 
amount expended for this purpose at Gary would seem 
adequate, but the supervision provided is not appropri- 
ate to the real needs of a system that is more or less ex- 
perimental in character.
-P-A-G-E-158
  108 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The administration is not efficient. The problems to 
be met—program making, corridor conduct, attendance, 
records, etc.—are admittedly difficult of solution. Yet 
the modern high school has dealt with these very prob- 
lems more or less successfully for years. 
Finally, there is even greater need of wise adminis- 
tration and supervision in elementary schools having 
extended and diversified programs and operating under a 
departmental organization than in conventional schools, 
but to secure central direction and control of the needed 
character it will be necessary, in our opinion, to provide a 
higher type of administrative and supervisory talent 
than is usually found in conventional systems.

  VII. COMPARATIVE COST 
HILE superintendents admit that extended 
\ VV and enriched programs and facilities, such as the 
two larger Gary schools afford, are desirable, 
many of them hold that under ordinary conditions the 
cost is prohibitive. On the other hand, boards of edu- 
cation have been strongly recommended to provide 
similar facilities and educational opportunities on the 
ground that, when such schools are operated under the 
new type of organization, they are no more expensive 
than conventional schools. Which of these conflicting 
opinions is correct? 
Our report on cost gives in detail the actual expendi- 
ture for all Gary schools for 1915-1916, and the cost 
by grades for the three largest schools. Comparative 
cost was not and could not be considered. To assemble 
data on the basis of which reliable comparisons could 
have been made would have involved an equally thor- 
oughgoing financial study of other cities. However, 
data presented in the several chapters of this present 
report now enable us to throw some light on the problem. 
The answer is not in terms of dollars and cents, but in 
terms of service. Though something more could be 
desired, the ideas of comparative cost now to be pre-

sented will not be without value from the standpoint of 
the considerations which determine the general school 
policies of a community. 
Differences of expense in providing and maintaining 
conventional: elementary schools, semimodern elemen- 
tary schools,’ and elementary schools like Emerson and 
Froebel are due, apart from the length of the school day, 
to differences in the cost of 
(x) Buildings, grounds, and equipment, or plant; 
(2) Instruction, or teachers’ salaries; 
(3) Administration and supervision; 
(4) Plant operation and upkeep; 
(5) Instructional equipment and supplies. 
COMPARATIVE PLANT COST 
~ In considering the relative building cost of a conven- 
tional schoo! and of schools like Emerson and Froebel, 
two questions are involved: (a) the difference in the 
amount and character of plant capacity required to do 
the same unit of service, for example, provide for sixty 
standard sized classes; and (b) the difference in cost of an 
equal capacity in regular classrooms and in special facil- 
ities. 
There is no magic in the new type of organization mak- 
ing it possible to accommodate two classes where for- 
merly only one was cared for. Hence, when the proposed 
pupil instruction day is six hours, the capacity required is, 
as we have seen, the same whether the school is conven-

tional or has special facilities and is operated on the de- 
partmental type of organization. There is, however, a 
difference in the character of the facilities. An illustra- 
tion will clarify the issue. If a community having 
a 30 room conventional school plant must, by reason of 
rapid growth in population, provide at one time for 30 
new classes, the situation may be met in one of two ways. 
The capacity of its conventional plant may be doubled 
by adding 30 conventional rooms; or an equivalent ca- 
pacity in special facilities may be provided. In the 
latter case, if the proposed program is divided as sug- 
gested on page 71, the 30 ordinary rooms already at 
hand may be used, and, in addition, it will be necessary 
to provide: 
(a) Gymnasium capacity equivalent to 113 standard 
classrooms; 
(b) Auditorium capacity equivalent to 63 standard 
classrooms; and 
(c) Capacity in other special facilities, such as nature 
study rooms, handwork rooms, cooking and manual 
training rooms, equivalent to 11§ standard classrooms; 
or a total capacity in special facilities equal to the 
capacity of 30 ordinary classrooms." 
The financial question before the community is, there- 
fore: Will a capacity in such special facilities equivalent 
to the capacity of 30 standard classrooms cost as much 
as, less, or more than, 30 conventional rooms? 
The cost of standard classrooms as well as of equiva- 
1See page 72.
-P-A-G-E-162
  112 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
lent capacity in special facilities varies from city to city 
and also with building standards. But in the same 
city and with building standards in both cases the same, 
school architects are generally of the opinion that on the 
whole special facilities, such as those in question, can be 
provided at approximately the same initial cost as an 
equivalent capacity in standard classrooms.' In other 
words, a new plant for a six hour school day and a pro- 
gram divided as suggested above, can be procured for 
about the same initial outlay as a new conventional 
building of the same capacity; further, when sufficient 
additional capacity is needed, a conventional plant can 
be provided with special facilities for about the same ex- 
penditure as would be required to provide an equivalent 
increased capacity in regular rooms. 
Although this conclusion, based on a 60 class building, 
holds approximately under the above conditions for 
plants sufficiently large to accommodate an extended and 
enriched program, whether for 18, 24, 30, or more classes, 
it is subject to a number of limitations; it would, for ex- 
ample, not cover extraordinary and unusual facilities, 
such as highly specialized laboratories for each of the 
sciences, or highly specialized practical shops, such as 
1The opinions of architects are of value, but they would be the first to 
grant that the issue can be finally settled only on the basis of actual 
construction cost. Unfortunately, such data are not now at hand. 
Moreover, the question can probably never be settled for all buildings, 
but will have to be settled for each plant separately in view of the par- 
ticular requirements. Among others, we have consulted the school 
architects of New York, Boston, St. Louis, Cleveland, and Newark.
-P-A-G-E-163
  COMPARATIVE COST 113 
forge and foundry. As pointed out above, such labora- 
tories are neither necessary nor desirable, and highly 
specialized practical equipment cannot be operated 
economically in an ordinary elementary school. Nor 
does the conclusion cover outside facilities, such as 
playgrounds, school gardens, and athletic fields. How- 
ever, if the comparison is limited to an elementary school 
for the first six grades, it would more nearly cover the 
needed playgrounds and school gardens, depending, of 
course, on land values and the land area provided. Fi- 
nally, the conclusion rests on the assumption that the 
two types of plants are used at their maximum capacities. 
It is, however, next to impossible, as we have seen,” 
to get maximum service out of a plant having special 
facilities and operated under the new type of organiza- 
tion, and this fact alone would probably increase the 
cost of such a plant as much as 5 per cent. over a con- 
ventional plant of the same actual capacity. 
Nor does the conclusion hold for a seven hour pupil 
instruction day in schools like Emerson and Froebel in 
comparison with a six hour pupil instruction day in con- 
ventional schools. For, as we have seen, when the pupil 
instruction day in such schools is seven hours, and the 
program is divided as suggested on page 74, the building 
requirements of a 60 class school, when regular rooms are 
used eight hours, are equivalent to the capacity of 62} 
standard classrooms, and when ordinary rooms are   
See pages 82-83. 
See pages 79-80. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  114 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
used seven hours, equivalent to 623%; standard classrooms.! 
That is, to extend the pupil instruction day in schools like 
Emerson and Froebel from six to seven hours increases 
the building requirements a little more than 4 per cent. 
A kindred question is the cost of remodeling a conven- 
tional plant to provide the special facilities required by 
an extended and enriched program and the new type of 
organization. If the remodeling contemplates no in- 
creased capacity, but merely changes standard classrooms 
into special facilities, such as handwork rooms, nature 
study rooms, and auditorium, the cost of remodeling 
is an added expense. It frequently happens, however, 
that there are rooms in conventional buildings which, 
while not suited to regular academic work, may, when 
slightly altered, be employed for special activities; for 
example, a basement room may be used for cooking or 
manual training. By reason of the space in conventional 
plants that may thus be brought into active service, it is 
sometimes possible to add to the capacity of the plant 
enough to cover the whole or a part of the remodeling cost. 
Unlike the conventional school, the semimodern school 
has, besides regular classrooms, certain special features, 
such as cooking and manual training rooms, auditorium 
or gymnasium; and, as operated, these contribute next 
to nothing to class capacity. Hence, other conditions 
and building standards being the same, plants of semi- 
modern schools always cost more than conventional 
plants of similar capacity, and their relative expensive- 
1See page 77.  
-P-A-G-E-165
  COMPARATIVE COST 115 
ness over conventional plants increases with the number 
of special facilities provided. 
In contrast, all special facilities in schools like Emer- 
son and Froebel, theoretically, at least, contribute their 
part to class capacity. The plant of a semimodern 
school is, therefore, also relatively more expensive 
than plants like Emerson and Froebel, and, under given 
conditions, might, although it probably never would, be 
as much as 50 per cent. more expensive. 
To illustrate: A semimodern school might offer pre- 
cisely the same program and its plant afford precisely the 
same special facilities as one of the larger Gary schools. 
The only essential difference between the two schools 
under these conditions would be: The former is operated 
on the classroom type of organization, which leaves 
regular rooms idle when children are in special rooms; and 
the latter is operated on the new type of organization, 
which attempts to keep all facilities in use as continu- 
ously as possible. In this event, when the pupil instruc- 
tion day is six hours and the proposed program is divided 
as suggested on page 71, a semimodern school to accom- 
modate 60 classes would require 60 regular rooms and a 
capacity in special facilities equivalent to 30 standard 
classrooms, or a total capacity equivalent to go standard 
classrooms; whereas a school operated like Emerson and 
Froebel to accommodate 60 classes would require a total 
capacity equivalent to 60 standard classrooms. 
Regard for economy prevents school authorities from 
1For plant requirements under the given conditions, see pages 71-72. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  116 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS ~ 
attempting highly extended programs in semimodern 
schools. But school authorities, especially in our larger 
cities, attempt in such schools moderately extended pro- 
grams. Consequently their plant expenditures are al- 
ways more per standard class than if they were content 
with conventional schools, and even when the pupil 
instruction day is not in excess of six hours, the outlay 
for plants may be as much as 50 per cent. greater per 
standard class than if the schools were operated on the 
new type of organization. In a word, whereas plant 
cost for a departmentalized school per standard class, 
exclusive of all outside facilities, will probably be as 
much as 5 per cent. more than for a conventional school, 
plant cost for a semimodern school is always greater 
per standard class than for a school operating under the 
new type of organization, and increases with the extent 
to which the program of the semimodern school requires 
special facilities. 
COMPARATIVE COST OF INSTRUCTION 
' Similarly, the comparative cost of instruction in con- 
ventional schools, semimodern schools, and schools like 
Emerson and Froebel depends on such differences as 
there may be in the amount and character of the teach- 
ing service to be procured. 
Conventional schools have a single teacher for each 
class. Therefore, a 60 class conventional school, when 
the pupil and teacher instruction day is six hours, needs 
60 regular teachers.  
-P-A-G-E-167
| aii a i 
COMPARATIVE COST 117 
With pupil instruction days of equal length, the 
number of class instruction hours for which a con- 
ventional school and schools like Emerson and Froebel 
must provide is the same. Hence, any difference in the 
number of teachers is due to differences in the size of the 
instruction groups, particularly in the special activities.! 
With a teacher and pupil instruction day of six hours 
in schools like Emerson and Froebel, the program would 
probably be divided three hours to academic work and 
three to special activities. The three hours to special 
activities would probably be apportioned: 
(a) Kindergarten and first grade, two hours to play 
and one hour to other special activities; 
(b) Second tosixth grades, one hour to physical training, 
one to auditorium, and one hour to other special activities; 
(c) Seventh and eighth grades, a half hour to physical 
training, a half hour to auditorium, and two hours to 
other special activities.” 
The instruction groups in physical training for kinder- 
1Gary practice sheds little light on this point. The two larger schools 
are combination elementary and high schools. At Emerson, in the 
spring term 1915-1916, for 9 high school and 14 elementary and kinder- 
garten classes there were, 29 teachers, besides 3 shopmen, a printer, 
and an assistant in sewing; at Froebel, for 7 high school and 45 elemen- 
tary and kindergarten classes, 52 teachers, besides 5 shopmen and a 
printer; at Jefferson, for 20 elementary and kindergarten classes, 20 
teachers and part time of a custodian; and at Beveridge, for 14 elemen- 
tary and kindergarten classes, 14 teachers and a practical cook. The 
pupil instruction day in all these schools is, however, seven hours. 
*It should be noted that this program contemplates no variety of 
specialized industrial opportunities. 
   
-P-A-G-E-168

garten and first grade would probably be one standard 
sized class, and for all other grades, two standard sized 
classes; for auditorium in all grades, two standard sized 
classes; and in other special activities for all grades 
through the sixth, a standard sized class, and for the 
seventh and eighth grades, a half of a standard sized class. 
Under these program conditions a 60 class school 
would require: 
(a) 30 regular academic teachers; 
(b) 875 physical training teachers; 
(c) 33% auditorium teachers; 
(d) x5 teachers of other special activities; a total of 
56% teachers! That is, 5 per cent. fewer teachers than 
a conventional school of the same size requires, and the   
1To accommodate 60 classes three hours daily in academic work is 
equal to 180 class instruction hours (603). Each teacher gives six 
class instruction hours daily, hence, there will be required 30 academic 
teachers (180-:-6). 
To give 16 kindergarten and first grade pupils (the estimated number 
in a 60 class school—see page 67) two hours of play daily is equal to 
32 Class instruction hours and would require 53 physical training teachers 
(32+6). To give 34 second to sixth grade pupils one hour of physical 
training daily, and 10 seventh and eighth grade classes a half hour is 
equal, with instruction groups two standard sized classes, to 3% class 
instruction hours, and would require 33%; physical training teachers 
(88-+6). 
To give 34 second to sixth grade classes one hour auditorium daily, 
and ro seventh and eighth grade classes a half hour is equal, with in- 
struction groups two standard sized classes, to 4° class instruction hours, 
and would require 3 ;4, auditorium teachers (82-6). 
To give 16 kindergarten and first grade pupils and 34 second to sixth 
grade pupils one hour daily in special activities other than auditorium and 
physical training is equal to 50 class instruction hours, and would require
-P-A-G-E-169
    COMPARATIVE COST 119 
same holds approximately for all schools large enough to 
accommodate an extended and enriched program. 
Any material change in the above program conditions 
and in the grade distribution of classes will alter the 
number as well as the kind of teachers required. For ex- 
ample, if we decrease the proportion of the total time for 
special activities assigned to auditorium and physical 
training, the number of other kinds of special teachers 
needed is increased. Increase the size of the instruction 
groups in other than academic instruction, and the 
number of special teachers to be employed is decreased. 
It is nevertheless evident that, under given program 
conditions with a six hour pupil instruction day, schools 
like Emerson and Froebel can operate with approxi- 
mately 5 per cent. fewer teachers than conventional 
schools of the same size. 
But these differences do not indicate the exact relative 
instruction cost. The kind of teachers to be employed 
is not the same. The conventional school needs regular 
teachers only. Schools like Emerson and Froebel use 
regular teachers for most, if not all, of the academic 
instruction, but approximately half of them should have 
special training and specialized experience. Such teach- 
ers generally receive higher salaries than regular teach- 
8% special teachers other than of physical training and auditorium. To 
give ro seventh and eighth grade classes two hours daily in special activi- 
ties other than physical training and auditorium is equal, when the 
instruction groups are half a standard sized class, to 4o class instruction 
hours (10X22), and would require 6 special teachers other than of 
auditorium and physical training (40+-6). 
   
-P-A-G-E-170
  120 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
ers. For example, the median salary of all regular ele- 
mentary teachers at Gary for 1915-1916 was $800,! and 
for special teachers,’ $900. Whether a difference of 124 
per cent. would be generally true we do not know. Yet, 
in view of the data at hand and the known higher salaries 
of special as compared with regular teachers in other 
grades of school work, authorities interested in establish- 
ing schools like Emerson and Froebel would be on the 
side of safety if some such salary differences were taken 
into account. 
There remains one other factor to consider. Sixty 
teachers are admittedly ample to care for 60 standard 
sized classes in a conventional school, but the 56% teach- 
ers, the estimated number required to care for an equal 
number of classes in a school like Emerson and Froebel, is 
the very minimum required under the given program con- 
ditions. To operate such a school with this number of 
teachers requires an ideal class distribution and 100 per 
cent. efficiency in the use of teachers. Ordinarily, owing 
particularly to irregularities in the number of classes 
in the several grades, this is impossible. Hence, in all 
probability, to care for 60 standard sized classes in such a 
school would require one, two, or perhaps three teachers 
in excess of 56%. 
41See The Gary Public Schools: A General Account, Ch. VI.” 
2Under special teachers are included those of auditorium, expression, 
music, freehand drawing, mechanical drawing, nature study, handwork, 
household arts, manual training, and physical training, but not shopmen, 
nor the high school science teachers who also teach seventh and eighth 
grade science.
-P-A-G-E-171
  COMPARATIVE COST. 121 
Therefore, when the probable difference in salaries of 
regular and special teachers, and the probable need of 
one, two, or three teachers in excess of the estimated 
number are taken into account, it appears that the in- 
struction cost for teachers’ salaries in schools like Emer- 
son and Froebel will be as much as in conventional schools 
and may easily run 6 per cent. higher.1 
Even this conclusion does not hold for schools like 
Emerson and Froebel when the pupil instruction day is 
seven hours. If the program for the seven hour pupil 
instruction day is divided as suggested on page 74, and 
if the instruction groups are of the size suggested on 
page 117, a 60 class school like Emerson or Froebel, 
when the teacher instruction day is six hours, requires 
30 regular teachers and 33% special teachers, or a total 
of 63§ as compared to 56 when the pupil instruction 
day in such schools is six hours.” 
1On the basis of the median salary for regular teachers at Gary the 
salaries for 60 teachers in a conventional school aggregate $48,000. For 
a school equal in size to Emerson or Froebel, on the basis of the above 
estimate, there is need of 30 regular teachers, who, at $800, would cost 
$24,000, and need of 26% special teachers, who, at $900, would cost 
$24,150, or a total of $48,150. If to this there are added three special 
teachers in excess of the estimated number, at $2,700, the total would 
aggregate $50,850, or 6 per cent. more than in a conventional school. 
2With the proposed seven hour pupil instruction day program for 
Froebel (see Appendix, Table G), 56 teachers care for 60 classes, 
12 of which are of high school gradé. The program requirements are, 
however, different from the above. It should be noted, for instance, that 
the 6 kindergarten classes have only a three period day and that there are 
8 classes circulating as helpers; the physical training and auditorium in- 
struction groups are also larger. It should also be noted that this pro- 
posed program provides only manual training and not a variety of special- 
ized industrial activities.
-P-A-G-E-172
122 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Such differences as there may be between the number 
of teachers required by a conventional and a semi- 
modern school of precisely the same size and with the 
same length of day arise from the fact that a semimodern 
school may and often does have special teachers. When 
they are occupied, a corresponding number of regular 
teachers are without classes and even the special teachers 
may not be kept busy. Obviously, a semimodern school 
will never require fewer teachers than a conventional 
school of the same size, and will ordinarily require more, 
the number varying with the extent to which regular 
teachers are relieved when their classes are under special 
teachers and with the extent to which special teachers are 
not kept fully engaged. 
Differences in the number of teachers required by a 
semimodern school over schools like Emerson and 
Froebel arise from the same cause. Special teachers do 
not take the place of regular teachers in the former as in 
the latter; they are additional. Therefore, a semi- 
modern school, which never needs fewer teachers than a 
conventional school, will probably require, with the 
pupil instruction day six hours and under the above pro- 
gram conditions, 5 per cent. more teachers than a school 
like Emerson or Froebel of the same size, and the excess 
will go above this according as the program calls for spe- 
cial teachers and these are provided. 
To complete as well as to summarize these comparisons, 
schools like Emerson and Froebel, under given program 
conditions with a pupil and teacher instruction day of six
-P-A-G-E-173
  _ COMPARATIVE COST 123 
hours, require approximately 5 per cent. fewer teachers 
than conventional schools of the same size, and the per 
cent. will probably never fall as low as this in comparison 
with semimodern schools. However, authorities inter- 
ested in extending and enriching the programs of their 
schools should not lose sight of the fact that the above 
estimate of the number of teachers required by schools 
like Emerson and Froebel may be exceeded in practice, 
nor of the fact that special teachers generally receive 
higher salaries than regular teachers. Hence, the in- 
struction cost in schools like Emerson and Froebel will 
doubtless be as high as, and may easily be as much as 
6 per cent. higher than, in conventional schools, but 
doubtless never as high as in semimodern schools. Let it, 
however, not be forgotten that for this relatively small 
possible increase in expense over the conventional school, 
immensely larger educational opportunities are obtained. 
The Gary scheme is not cheap in the sense that it offers 
more and costs less; it is only cheap in the sense that it 
offers much more and costs at most only a little more. 
COMPARATIVE COST OF OTHER ITEMS 
Of the other items affecting cost little that is definite 
can be said. Schools like Emerson and Froebel are 
more complex and require more delicate adjustment 
than either conventional or semimodern schools, and 
to be effective require a superintendent, supervisors, 
and school principals of high type. Hence, administra-

tion and supervision will be more expensive in such schools 
than in either conventional or semimodern schools. 
The plant operation and upkeep cost of schools like 
Emerson and Froebel will also be slightly more than that 
of conventional schools, as the plant is more elaborate. 
On the other hand, the building requirements of a semi- 
modern school are, in proportion to the number of pupils 
accommodated, more extensive than those of schools like 
Emerson and Froebel, because the special facilities are for 
the most part in addition to regular classrooms. Hence, 
plant operation and upkeep cost of semimodern schools 
will exceed that of schools like Emerson and Froebel to 
the extent that special facilities are provided which do 
not add to pupil capacity. 
There will be little difference in the academic instruc- 
tional equipment needed. Each regular room of a con- 
ventional and a semimodern school has some provision 
for the academic branches. In schools like Emerson 
and Froebel it is not only possible but necessary to fur- 
nish given rooms for teaching one or more of these 
studies. Therefore, while the academic instructional 
equipment in any one of these rooms would greatly ex- 
ceed that of any single regular room in either a conven- 
tional or a semimodern school, there would probably 
be little difference in the total amount in the different 
kinds of schools, although for thesame expenditure schools 
like Emerson and Froebel would doubtless be the best 
and the semimodern the least well provided. 
There will be some difference in the equipment and
-P-A-G-E-175
  COMPARATIVE COST 125 
supply requirements of the special branches. These 
requirements in the semimodern school will exceed those 
of the conventional school to the extent that the former 
provides special facilities and gives specialized instruc- 
tion in drawing, cooking, and manual training, whereas 
those of schools like Emerson and Froebel, to the extent 
that they give greater emphasis to the special activities, 
will exceed both those of the conventional and the semi- 
modern school. 
Experience thus far does not enable us to establish 
with certainty any one of the above positions. Never- 
theless, there are good grounds for believing that author- 
ities planning to extend and enrich the programs of their 
systems, and to adopt the departmental type of organiza- 
tion, would do well to count on an increased expenditure 
for administration and supervision, for operation and 
upkeep, and on added outlay for instructional equipment 
and supplies, varying in amount according as their pres- 
ent schools are conventional or semimodern. On the 
other hand, they would, of course, procure additional edu- 
cational opportunities for this additional expenditure. 
SUMMARY 
Of the three kinds of elementary schools under discus- 
sion, the semimodern is therefore on practically every 
count the most expensive, and its relative expensiveness 
increases according as its program is extended and en- 
tiched, as its plant is improved by special facilities, and 
as special teachers are provided.
-P-A-G-E-176
  126 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Expenditures for administration and supervision, 
plant operation and upkeep, instructional equipment 
and supplies will be heavier in schools like Emerson and 
Froebel than in conventional schools. The building 
and building equipment cost, aside from what may be 
spent on outside facilities, will be approximately 5 per 
cent. higher, and there are good reasons to believe that 
the instruction cost may be about 6 per cent. higher. 
Comparative expenses cannot, however, be fairly con- 
sidered except on the basis of comparative opportunities. 
Schools like Emerson and Froebel may and probably do 
cost more to build and to run than conventional schools, 
but this slightly increased cost is a trifle in comparison 
with the increased educational opportunities provided.

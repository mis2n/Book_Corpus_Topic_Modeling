Preface to the First Edition 
In presenting this collection of free exercise material in book 
form the author trusts that it will be of service to students and 
teachers of physical education. 
The contents concern themselves chiefly with terminology, 
technique, classification, and the progressive arrangement of the 
material for the different grades, the teaching and value of these 
exercises being omitted since they are beyond the scope of the 
book, although frequent suggestions with reference to the method 
of procedure in teaching and the effect of the exercises are 
given. ; 
Thanks are due and gratefully acknowledged to Dr. Ferd. 
Aug. Schmidt for the use of some of his illustrations, and to Mr. 
Gustav Braun, director of physical education in the Shortridge 
High School, Indianapolis, for drawings made from photographs 
for which students of the Normal College were kind enough to

  Preface to the Second Edition 
The second edition of “Free Exercises Without and With 
Hand Apparatus” has been considerably changed. It contains 
the following newly added features: 
1. Methods of presentation. 
2. Sample lessons composed of carefully selected setting-up 
exercises for and adapted to each age-group, which may be used 
in institutions where fuller courses in free exercises cannot for 
some reason be given. They will also serve as examples accord- 
ing to which other setting-up drills may be arranged. 
3. Stunts requiring skill and strength, and done with wands 
and without wands, are suggested. These may be used as tests 
or as requirements for various grades. 
4, The system of movements upon which the wand and club 
exercises are based are given at the beginning of their respec- 
tive chapters. 
5. Finally, attention is called to the kind of free exercises 
not commonly used, as exercises with flags, rings, long wands, 
and two wands, and a brief description given of the type of 
exercise possible with these hand apparatus. Many new illus- 
trations have also been added. 
The author trusts that the enlarged Vol. II of “Physical 
Education” will meet with the same approval by teachers and 
students of physical education, as his first edition.

  FREE EXERCISES 
Free exercises have been defined by Spiess as exercises 
which can be executed by an individual upon an ordinary floor 
by movements of his own body without any auxiliary means. 
When wands, dumb-bells, clubs, etc., are used as auxiliary 
means, the exercises are spoken of as wand exercises, club ex- 
ercises, etc. 
There is so much similarity among these different types of 
exercises, however, one being but a repetition of the other with 
hand apparatus added, that the nomenclature throughout this 
book will be based entirely upon the free exercises whch will 
then be adapted to the others. Only in a few cases, where it 
was inevitable, will the terminology name the position or move- 
ment of the hand apparatus in place of the movement of the part 
of the body. 
DIRECTIONS. 
The terminology of directions for movements of the different 
parts of the body is based upon the surfaces of the body; i. e., 
the front, rear, left and right surfaces, and upon the head and 
feet. 
Six principal directions and positions are distinguished ; 
viz., forward, sideward left, sideward right, backward, upward, 
and downward, based upon the previously mentioned points. 
If we consider the directions as being confined within the 
periphery of a horizontal circle, starting from the center of the 
circle forward and backward will constitute a straight line and 
likewise sideward left and right, bisecting each other at the cen- 
ter and forming four right angles. 
Halfway between these and forming a 45-degree angle with 
them, are the intermediate directions and positions, which may 
be “outward,” i. e., from the body, or “inward,” toward the 
body. There are four intermediate directions and positions in 
the horizontal plane, viz.: fore-outward, halfway between side-
-P-A-G-E-6
  2 DIRECTIONS. 
ward and forward, away from the body; fore-inward, halfway 
between sideward and forward, but toward and partly across 
the body; back-outward, as fore-outward, but directed toward 
the back; back-inward, as fore-inward, but directed toward the 
back. 
Movements in vertical planes may be divided in a similar 
manner, the upward and downward directions or positions being 
bisected by the sideward left and right directions and positions. 
In the lateral vertical plane, which is an imaginary plane passing 
through the body from side to side, the intermediate. positions 
are obliquely side-downward (to the left and right) and obliquely 
side-upward (to the left and right). 
Arm circling performed in this plane is defined by the two 
sides, i. e., to the left or right, and by the degree of the circle 
when both arms move in like directions; as “outward” when the 
arms move inward, upward, sideward, downward, and as “in- 
ward” when they move in the opposite direction; i. e., sideward, 
upward, inward and downward, starting from the fundamental 
position. 
In the vertical plane which passes from the front to the 
rear of the body (antero-posterior vertical plane) the inter- 
mediate positions and directions occur between the upward- 
downward and the forward-backward directions and are obliquely 
fore-downward, obliquely back-downward, obliquely fore-upward, 
and obliquely back-upward. 
Arm circling in this plane is defined as “backward” if the 
arms move forward, upward, backward and downward, and as 
forward if they move in the opposite direction starting from 
the fundamental position. 
Midway between these two planes are two diagonal vertical 
planes. Directions and positions within them are best defined by 
using outward and inward in the sense as previously explained. 
The following directions and positions of arms only occur in 
these planes, viz. : 
Obliquely fore-downward outward, 
Obliquely fore-downward inward, 
Fore-outward (also in the horizontal plane), 
Obliquely fore-upward, outward, and 
Obliquely fore-upward inward.
-P-A-G-E-7
  
PRINCIPLES OF SELECTION. 
ow 
These positions do not occur frequently in free exercises. 
Arm circles in these planes are defined as obliquely forward left 
(right) and obliquely backward left (right). 
In determining the directions of different parts in a com- 
bined exercise it is to be remembered that directions are based 
upon the body itself, and that the relative directions of two or 
more parts will, therefore, always be the same regardless of what 
position the body may assume. Upward is always above the 
head, no matter whether the body is in an upright, prone, or 
supine position. Forward is always in front of the trunk, dis- 
regarding whether it is turned or lowered forward. Thus in 
lying on the back, arm raising fore-upward is not toward the 
ceiling, but toward a position above the head. Likewise, arm 
raising forward when the trunk is turned is toward the direction 
in which the front of the trunk is directed and not toward the 
original forward direction. 
PRINCIPLES OF SELECTION. 
oa 
Because of the manifold movement possibilities of the human 
mechanism, it is quite evident that all the movements of its 
different parts cannot be included in a system of free exercises 
and that some guiding principles which will assist one in dis- 
tinguishing between the useless and useful and between the 
worthless and valuable, be determined upon. 
The selection of such principles necessitates an investigation 
of the values inherent in free exercises, with reference to their 
importance for the human organism and the defining of these 
values. They, of course, will form but a part of the group 
obtainable by physical education which are usually considered 
«under gymnastic or physical educational values. 
An effort should be made to attain the following important 
values by discriminative selection of material. 
HYGIENIC VALUE —Such movements should be selected 
as have an appreciable influence upon the maintenance and pro- 
motion of health. The trunk and springing exercises are the 
most important for this.
-P-A-G-E-8
  4 CLASSIFICATION. 
DEVELOPMENTAL VALUE.—Such movements should 
be selected as will develop and strengthen important but fre- 
quently neglected muscle groups and give the whole musculature 
increased tone. This will eliminate small ineffective exercises 
and mild executions. Movements of the hand and wrist as are 
used in apparatus work should also be eliminated. 
POSTURAL VALUE.—Although all movements are to be 
performed with good form, which includes correct posture, 
certain special exercises which particularly strengthen those 
muscle groups active in correct carriage of head and trunk 
should be selected. These are then later amplified by apparatus 
work. 
CO-ORDINATIVE AND PREPARATORY VALUE.— 
Such movements should be selected as offer neutro-muscular 
training, particularly in useful and natural co-ordination. Pref- 
erence should be given at all times to these types of exercises. 
Movements which have a preparatory value for the teaching 
of new exercises, or for the purpose of increasing the effect of 
another exercise, should be selected. 
Every exercise whose selection can be justified because of 
one of the above values no doubt also possesse&, in a lesser degree, 
the other values. It may, however, happen that a combination 
of them consists of equally dominant values. 
Whereas certain values will always prevail in a majority of 
the free exercises, other values will predominate in other 
branches of physical education. 
_ CLASSIFICATION. 
Free Exercises may be classified in a general way according 
to the bodily states in which movements of the various parts are 
performed, in three orders: 
Exercises of the First Order, consisting of those executed in 
standing, walking or marching, and running. 
Exercises of the Second Order, consisting of those executed 
in kneeling, sitting, lying, and support lying. 
Exercises of the Third Order, consisting of exercises of the
-P-A-G-E-9
ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE ACTIVITY. 5 
  First or Second Order, performed with the help of one or more 
assistants. (Companion Exercises.) : 
A more specific classification dealing with the material and 
designed to give a comprehensive grasp embracing the various 
attributes of the movements involved in free exercises, consists 
of the following: 
I. According to the nature of the activity. 
II. According to the body part used, and 
III. According to the structure of the exercise; i. e., accord- 
ing to the movements involved in it. 
I. ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE ACTIVITY. 
The following activities occur in free exercises. The terms 
of the activities are either general, in which case they include a 
number of related activities, each of which must again be desig- 
nated by a specific term, as a command; or special, in which case 
the special term becomes the command. The verb in second 
person is used as a command of execution. 
1. Elevation, a general term consisting of moving a part 
from a low toa higher position comprising two specific 
terms used as commands. 
a) Raising, a movement of slow or moderate 
speed. 
b) Swinging, a movement of rapid speed. 
2. Lowering, consisting of moving a part from a higher 
to a lower position in slow or moderate speed. 
Swinging is employed if it is performed rapidly. 
3. Flexion, a general term used particularly to designate 
the bending of arms, legs and trunk into various posi- 
tions as a group of related activities, while special 
commands and terms are used to indicate the specific 
positions or activities. 
It comprises: 
a) Bending arms upward, to thrust, to strike; 
b) Placing hands on hips, front of shoulders, rear 
of head;
-P-A-G-E-10
  CLASSIFICATION. 
c) Raising or swinging knee and foot, bending 
_ knees ; 
d) Bending trunk forward, fore-downward, side- 
_ ward and backward. 
‘4, Extension, a general term used particularly to designate 
the various straightening movements of the arms, 
legs and trunk as a group after having been previ- 
ously bent, while special terms and commands are 
used to indicate the specific positions or movements. 
It comprises : 
a) Arm straightening, stretching, thrusting, strik- 
ing ; 
b) Leg and knee straightening ; 
c) Trunk straightening. 
5. Moving, a general term used to name a group of ac- 
tivities of the straight arms, as “Move arms into 
horizontal, vertical; and oblique position.” Some 
aforementioned specific term is used to indicate a par- 
ticular activity, as “Arms sideward (from upward)— 
lower or swing.” Also— 
Carrying, a specific term used to designate the moving 
of a part of the body in a horizontal plane; i. e., from 
one horizontal position to another; e. g., “Arms side- 
ward (from forward)—Carry.” 
6. Rotation or turning, a specific term used to designate a 
movement of the whole body or a part of it about its 
length axis. The degree must be indicated when the 
whole body is turned; e. g., “1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1/1 turn 
left (right).” The word “turn” is used as command. 
7. Circling, a specific term used to indicate an activity by 
which a part of the body describes a circle or a part 
of it, usually more than a half. “Begin” is used as 
a command here. 
8. Stepping Activities, a general term used to name a 
group of related activities leading to a variety of 
positions of the legs obtained by stepping. They 
comprise :
-P-A-G-E-11
  ACCORDING TO THE BODY-PART USED. ee 
a) Foot placing ; 
b) Striding; 
c) Straddling ; 
d) Stepping proper; 
e) Lunging; 
f) The Fallout; 
g) The Layout. 
h) Kneeling, a specific term, quite half-explana- 
tory. It is performed on one as a “stepping 
activity,” and on both knees from the funda- 
mental position. 
9. Rocking, a specific term used to name an up and down 
movement of the entire body, performed by raising 
and lowering heels, or raising heels, lowering and 
raising toes. : 
10. Combined Activities, used as a general term. The two 
or more activities combined are always separately in- 
dicated, and may be like or unlike; as raising and 
raising, bending and raising, etc. 
11. Swaying, a specific term for a combined activity of the 
trunk, consisting of a to and fro movement, as from 
bending left to right, from backward to forward, and 
turning from left to right (turn swaying). 
a) Fore-backward swaying ; 
b) Side swaying ; 
c) Turn swaying.

III. ACCORDING TO THE STRUCTURE. 
A free exercise is composed of movements which begin from 
a definite starting position and again terminate in that position. 
We have seen that these movements may consist of one or more 
activities and of one or more parts of the body. The number of 
such movements included in an exercise, however, may vary 
greatly, so that it becomes rather complex, consisting of several 
intermediate movements and terminal positions before the start- 
ing position is again assumed. 
An understanding of this progression from simple to complex, 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  10 CLASSIFICATION. 
which has a purely mental basis, will assist considerably in the 
grading of the material. 
The following groups, which are the most important in this 
classification, are to be distinguished : 
1) Simple Exercises. They consist of two movements. The 
initial movement leads from a starting to a terminal 
position. The final movement is a reverse of this and 
again leads to the starting position.. (See Grades I-II.) 
2) Bilateral Alternations of the Same Exercise. A simple 
exercise possible of left and right execution is per- 
formed to one side and then to the other. (See Grades 
I-II.) 
Bilateral alternations are iso possible, however, of 
all the complex exercises which follow. 
3) Alternations of Two Exercises of Similar and Dissimilar 
Parts. A simple exercise of one part is alternated with 
another exercise of the same or of a different. part. 
(See Grades ITI-IV.) 
This is also possible with complex exercises. 
4) Simple Intersected Exercises. These are composed of a 
simple exercise of two dissimilar parts arranged in a 
sequence. The initial movement leads to a terminal 
position which is maintained during a movement of a 
second part into a position and its reversal to the first 
terminal position. The final movement is the reverse of 
the first, leading again to the se position. (See 
Grades III-IV.) 
This and all the groups which follow are possible of 
bilateral execution with a few exceptions which will be 
quite evident. 
5) Combined Exercises. They consist of— 
1. Two different simple exercises of two similar parts, 
as arms or legs, and 
2. Two simple exercises of two or more dissimilar parts 
executed simultaneously. (See Grades ITI-IV, and 
Grades VII-IX.)
-P-A-G-E-15
  
ACCORDING TO THE STRUCTURE. 11 
6) Linked or Enchained Exercises. The reverse of the initial 
movement of one part occurs simultaneously with the 
initial movement : 
(1) Of another similar part, or 
(2) Of one or two dissimilar parts. 
The initial movement may also consist of two dissimilar 
parts. (See Grades III-IV and V-VI.) 
7) Combined Intersected Exercises. They are composed of 
simple exercises of three dissimilar parts arranged in a 
sequence. The initial movement, consisting of two 
parts, leads to a terminal position, which is sustained 
during a movement of a third part into a position and 
its reversal to the first position. The final movement is 
the reverse of the first and again leads to the starting 
position. (See Grades V-VI.) 
8) Simple Exercises Intersected by Combined. The move- 
ments of the previous group are so altered that the 
initial and terminal movements become the two inter- 
mediate and the two intermediate become the first and 
last movements. (See Grades V-VI.) 
9) One-Part Sequences. They consist of movements of one 
part of the body in which the initial movement is fol- 
lowed by one or more intermediate movements and 
these by the reverse of the first movement which leads to 
the starting position. The four-movement sequences are 
mostly used. In these the initial movement is followed 
by an intermediate movement into a terminal position, 
another intermediate movement reversing the previous 
one and leading to the first position, and a final which 
is the reverse of the initial movement again ending in 
the starting position. (See Grades ITI-IV.) 
10) Augmented Sequences. To a four-movement sequence a 
two-movement exercise of another part is added in two 
ways: 
(1) To the two intermediate movements, or 
(2) . To the initial and final movement. 
(See Grades V-VI.)
-P-A-G-E-16
12 CLASSIFICATION. 
11) Complex Sequences. To a four-movement sequence two- 
movement exercises of a second and third part are 
added in three ways: 
(1) One simple exercise to the initial and final and 
one to the intermediate movements ; 
(2) Both simple exercises to the initial and final 
movements ; 
(3) Both to the intermediate movements. 
(See Grades VII-IX.) 
12) Two-Part Sequences. These are composed of sequences 
of two dissimilar parts performed simultaneously. (See 
Grades VII-IX.) 
13) Augmented Two-Part Sequences. A simple exercise of a 
third part is added to the two-part sequence, preferably 
to the two intermediate movements. (See Grades 
Sxl)   14) Series. These consist of three or more different exercises 
: of any of the preceding or following groups executed 
in succession. (See Grades V-VI and VII-IX.) 
15) Irregular Sequences. In these each intermediate move- 
ment ends in a different terminal position from the fore- 
going so that no movement is reversed. They may con- 
sist of : 
(1) One-Part ; 
(2) Augmented ; 
(3) Two-Part, or 
(4) Augmented Two-Part Sequences. 
Their complexity limits their usefulness. (See Ad- 
vanced Work.) 
16) Eight-Movement Sequences. They consist of a chain of 
eight movements, so arranged that intermediate move- 
ments are repeated and then reversed or that they are 
not repeated, but that the first four movements differ 
and are then reversed. They may consist of:

complexity limits their usefulness. 
THE ORDER OF EXERCISES AND FORMS OF 
EXECUTION. 
The following order for a lesson in free exercises has been 
observed throughout the graded material. It is an arbitrary ar- 
rangement which has been adopted as a guide to students and 
to insure proper selection and correct variation: 
Unit I. General exercises, consisting principally of arm and 
foot and leg movements, to which head and trunk movements are 
added in some groups in the upper grades. Rythmic execution. 
Unit II. Postural exercises, comprising slow, forceful con- 
tractions, particularly of the muscle groups active in maintaining 
good carriage of head and trunk. Arm and leg movements are 
added to increase the effect. Execution on command or in slow 
rhythm. 
Unit III. Balancing exercises, consisting of foot and leg 
movements, to which those of the head, arms and trunk are 
added as they increase in difficulty. Execution on command or 
in slow rhythm. 
Unit IV. Antero-posterior trunk exercises, comprising trunk 
movements in a forward and backward direction, to which arm 
and leg movements are added to increase the effect. Rhythmic 
execution. 
  Unit V. Exercises of Special Skill are practiced under this 
unit. They may be replaced by a repetition of the exercises of 
the first unit. Rhythmic execution. : 
Unit VI. Lateral trunk exercises, consisting of trunk move- 
ments in a sideward direction. Arm and leg movements are 
added as in the fourth unit. Rhythmic execution.
-P-A-G-E-18
  
  14 EXERCISES AND FORMS. OF EXECUTION. 
Unit VII. Springing exercises, comprising all such move- 
ments as propel the body upward or from place so as to give it 
momentary flight. Rhythmic execution and execution on com- 
mand. 
Unit VIII. Respiratory exercises, consisting principally of 
arm and trunk exercises, to which breathing is added. They may 
be given after any exercise when the instructor thinks it ad- 
visable. - 
It is necessary, furthermore, to understand the different 
methods of execution employed throughout the graded free ex- 
ercises in order to present the lessons properly. 
1) Execution on Response or Command. Every exercise is 
given first in this manner until correct form is acquired ; 
e.g. Arms fore-upward—swing ; downward—swing. 
2) Rhythmic Execution. This follows the execution on com- 
mand after good form has been attained. The word 
“begin” or “start” is used as a signal. This is followed 
by counting as many numbers as there are movements 
in the exercise and then repeating the cotint. Each 
numeral must be synchronous with the movement and 
not precede it, or follow it. 
3) Unlimited Execution. This refers to sequences and per- 
mits a repetition of the intermediate movements of the 
sequence an unrestricted number of times, depending 
upon the exercise and what the instructor has in view. 
Applied in rhythm and on response. 
4) Limited Execution. In this form the exercise is given 
as arranged without repeating any part of it. This 
does not apply to the return movements through pre- 
viously assumed terminal positions of a sequence.

NOMENCLATURE AND TECHNIQUE. 
The Fundamental Position. 
In position—stand. (Fig. 1.) Heels together, toes turned 
outward to a comfortable angle; arms extended, palms toward 
and a few inches from side of body. The fingers are ex- 
tended and together with the forefingers in line with the median 
line of the thighs. Head up, chin drawn in, chest raised without 
being forced and weight of body more on the balls of the feet

than on the heels. The position suggests firmness, but not 
rigidity. 
The Rest Position. In place—rest. The right foot is placed 
back-outward about two foot-lengths distant (or the left fore- 
outward) with the sole on the floor and a half transference of 
weight so that the body weight will be equally divided on both 
feet. The hands hang loosely: at the side or are grasped in rear, 
but the trunk retains its upright posture as in the fundamental 
position. 
Faults: Weight over one foot; drooping shoulders.
-P-A-G-E-20
  16 NOMENCLATURE AND TECHNIQUE. 
Head (Neck) Exercises. 
All neck exercises should embody the resistive feature. 
I. LOWERING AND RAISING HEAD. 5 
1) Lower head forward—lower. Raise. (Fig. 2.) 
The head is slowly tipped forward, the chin approaching the 
neck. Return to the erect posture. Fault: chin sinking on chest. 
2) Lower head backward—lower. Raise. (Fig. 2.) 
The head is slowly inclined backward. The 
movement involves the whole neck and is accom- 
panied by a slight raising of the chest. The chin is 
drawn in with the raising. Faults: tilting head and Fig. 2— Lower head backward; thrusting chin forward. 
forward. 
  3) Lower head left-sideward—lower. Raise. 
The head is slowly inclined to the left shoulder. There must 
be an equal pull on the anterior and posterior neck muscles to 
insure a true sideward movement. 
Il. TURNING OF THE HEAD. 
Head to left—turn. Re-turn or Forward-turn. 
' The head is kept erect and rotates to the left as far as pos- 
sible. 
Ill. CIRCLING OF THE HEAD. 
(From forward lowered or backward lowered position, or 
beginning with this movement.) 
Circle head to the left—begin. Halt. 
The head moves through the sideward lowered position to the 
backward (forward) position, then through the opposite side- 
ward position to the starting position. 
Trunk Exercises. 
All movements are described as starting from the correct 
fundamental position. 
I. LOWERING AND RAISING THE TRUNK. 
Lower trunk forward—lower. Raise. (Fig. 3.) 
The movement takes place mainly in the hip joint, the spine

being kept as straight as possible; the chest remains arched and 
the head must not be lowered. The upper back muscles are kept

erect. Palms are turned downward unless otherwise stated. The 
lowering movement returns the arms to the position described 
in the fundamental stand. Faults: protruding head and abdomen. 
(3). Raise arms backward—raise. Lower. (Fig. 
12.) 
The arms move backward as far as possible, 
hands shoulder width apart with palms turned 
toward each other unless otherwise stated. The 
horizontal position is not attainable owing to the 
: limited motion in the shoulder joint. The chest 
batara “"™S must be képt arched. Fault: flat chest. 
  (b) The vertical (upward) position. (Figs. 13 and 25.) 
(1) Raise arms fore-upward—raise. Lower. 
Arms pass through the forward position and 
continue in the same plane until they are in a line 
with the trunk. The hands are the width of the 
shoulders or slightly more apart. 
(2) Raise arms side-upward—raise. Lower. 
Arms pass through the side position and on- 
ward to the upward position described above. 
Faults: slight knee bending, protruding head and 
abdomen. Fig. 13—Arms upward. 
  (c) The oblique positions. 
(1) Raise arms obliquely fore-upward—raise. Lower. 
(2) Raise arms obliquely fore-downward—raise. Lower. 
(3) Raise arms obliquely side-upward—raise. Lower. 
(4) Raise arms obliquely side-downward—raise. Lower. 
The above are positions halfway between the directions desig- 
nated. The palms are turned inward with the first two, upward 
with the third, and downward with the last exercise.

  22 NOMENCLATURE AND TECHNIQUE. 
Il. SWINGING THE EXTENDED ARMS. 
Swinging differs from raising of the arm in the degree of 
speed involved in the movement. The directions and the posi- 
tions into which the arms are swung resemble the foregoing ex- 
ercises of the extended arms. The faults occurring in the termi- 
nal positions are the same as in raising. To these exercises may 
be added swings in two different planes. 
(1) Swing arms fore-upward and sideward—swing. 
Upward and fore-downward (or return)—swing. 
(2) Swing arms side-upward and forward—swing. 
Upward and side-downward—swing. 
The directions through which the arms swing are indicated, 
pausing in the given terminal position. A variety of such swings 
are obtainable by using different starting positions. 
Ill. CIRCLING OF THE ARMS. 
Circling resembles arm swinging in the velocity of the move- 
ment and is performed in lateral, antero-posterior and diagonal 
(with clubs) vertical planes.

(1) Circle arms inward—begin. Halt. (Figs. 14 and 15.) 
When executed from the fundamental position the arms move 
through the sideward to the upward position (lateral plane) and 
cross in front of the body in returning to the sides of the thighs,

remaining as extended as possible throughout the circling. Faults: 
bending at elbows, swinging out of the plane. 
(2) Circle arms outward—begin. Halt. (Figs. 14 and 15.) 
Done in reverse order from inward. 
Whole and 34 inward and outward circles are also per- 
formed from the sideward or upward position as sequences. The . 
command is formulated as follows: Swing arms sideward (1). 
3% (or whole) double (or single) arm circle inward (2). Return 
movements, the whole circle being’ per- 
formed in the opposite direction or repeated 
(3-4). 
(3) Circle arms backward—begin. Halt.

of circles or whole circles are to be performed in opposite direc- 
tion, it is commanded; whole (34) double arm circle (direction) 
—one. Return—two. Circling is also executed from the vertical 
or horizontal positions and arranged as sequences. 
(5) Arm circumduction or small double arm circles backward— 
begin. Halt. (Fig. 14.) 
It is similar to the arm circling backward but a much smaller 
movement. The exercise begins from the sideward starting posi- 
tion, the hands describing a circle of about one foot in diameter. 
The movement should be performed chiefly in the shoulder line 
and behind it. Faults: same as those in the sideward horizontal 
position.

IV. ROTATING THE ARMS. 
Mainly in the “arms raised sideward” position. 
Turn palms upward and downward—begin. Halt. 
The arm is rotated in the shoulder joint so that the palm is 
upward or slightly beyond it. Rotating movements are always 
done quickly. They may be combined with different arm move- 
ments; as, Raise arms sideward with palms upward—raise.

V. FLEXED ARM POSITIONS. 
(1) Hands on hips—place. Re-place. (Fig. 17.) 
The fingers are pressed 
firmly together and placed 
on the hips, the fingers di- 
rected forward and the 
thumbs in rear. The wrist 
is slightly bent, the hands 
resting fully on the hip. 
The elbows are forced

  (2) Hands in rear of head (neck)—place. Re-place. (Fig. 18.) 
The arms are swung sideward and 
the forearms bent so that the finger tips 
touch at the’base of the skull. The hand, 
wrist and forearm are in line and the 
elbows directed slightly backward. The 
head must not be pushed forward.

The hands are closed to a fist, raised rapidly 
toward the median line and upward to the side 
of the shoulders with the palms directed toward 
them. The forearms assume a vertical position 
with the elbows close to the side and covering 
the upper arm. Faults: over extension of the 
lumber spine, wrong position of the arms.

V. ARM EXTENSIONS. 
(a) Arm straightening. 
It is executed from the “upward bend” and “forearm strike” 
positions. 5 
(1) From the upward bend position: 
Straighten or stretch arms sideward—straighten. Bend. 
Straightening. The arms are suddenly and_ thoroughly 
straightened in the indicated direction, the hands completely 
opening with the movement. It is executed in the same direc- 
tions as raising of the extended arms, the terminating positions 
and the faults associated with them will therefore be the same 
as those described under arm raising. The return movement is 
direct. 
Stretching is a slow, exaggerated, straightening movement of 
the arms. It should include the effort of reaching as far as pos- 
sible in the indicated direction. The sideward and upward direc- 
tions are principally used. 
(2) From the forearm strike position: 
Straighten arms sideward (only)—straighten. Bend. 
It consists of a quick outward flinging of the forearms, the 
movement being confined to the elbow joint. The terminal posi- 
tion being the same as that obtained from raising arms sideward. 
(b) Arm thrusting. 
Thrust arms sideward—thrust. Bend. 
It is performed as arm straightening in all directions except- 
ing that the hands are kept closed. 
(c) Arm striking. 
It is a quick movement performed in two directions, viz.:
-P-A-G-E-31
  
LEG‘EXERCISES. 27 
sideward and obliqtely side-downward from the ordinary strike 
position (hands over shoulders) and from the “arm for strike 
from head” position. 
(1) Strike sideward—strike. Bend. 
(2) Strike obliquely side-downward—strike. Bend. 
The terminating positions are the same as those resulting 
from arm raising with the exception that the hands are kept 
closed and the knuckles directed backward. 
VII. ARM MOVING, 
The arms are moved from a previously assumed position into 
any of the positions given under “arm raising.” A term suitable 
to the activity is selected. If they are moved from one horizontal 
position to another the term “carry” is used. \ 
Combining two or more of the previously named positions 
gives rise to “sequences.” 
Leg Exercises. 
I. IN THE FUNDAMENTAL POSITION. 
(1) On toes—rise, or heels—raise. Lower. 
The -ankles are thoroughly extended, the heels separated. 
The fundamental position is otherwise retained. -Sink gently 
without jarring. Faults: slight knee bending and slight bending 
backward. 
(2) On toes—rock. Halt. 
Heels are raised and lowered in one count. 
(3) Raise left and right toes alternately, or linked toe raising— 
begin. Halt. 
The toes of one foot are lowered while those of the other are 
being raised. Count one for the left, two for the right foot, etc. 
(4) On toes and heels—rock. Halt. 
The body rises on the toe and heels alternately lifting the 
heels and toes respectively from the floor. 
(5) Feet—close. Open. 
The toes are raised slightly and lowered while the inner mar- 
gins of the feet are firmly brought together. Return to the cor- 
rect angle in opening. Heel opening may be given after the feet 
are closed; also after previously raising heels.
-P-A-G-E-32
  28 NOMENCLATURE AND TECHNIQUE. 
(6) Knees half deep—bend. Straighten. 
The movement is preceded by heel raising. In the obtained 
position (squat stand) the heels are raised, knees directed out- 
ward over the toes and flexed to a 45° angle, trunk and head 
erect. Extend knees thoroughly in returning to position. Fault: 
stooping forward, head dropping. 
       
  Fig. 23—Bend knees deep. Place hands on hips. Correct and faulty execution. 
() Knees deep—bend. Straighten. (Fig. 23.) 
As the previous exercise excepting that the knees are flexed 
to their maximum. The same faults occur. 
(8) On both knees—kneel. To a stand—rise. Fig. 24.) 
After having bent the knees to the fullest extent as in “knees 
deep bend” place knees gently on the floor into 
“double knee stand.” Rise in the reverse order. 
Position of trunk and 
head is as in the fun- 
damental position.

Fault: leaning forward. 
II. RAISING THE EXTENDED LEG. 
1) Left leg forward—raise. Lower. 
The extended leg is raised forward to 
the horizontal, toes pointing, head and trunk 
erect. Same fault as in knee raising: bend-

2) Left leg sideward—raise. Lower. 
The extended leg is raised sideward, toes pointing, the move- 
ment. being confined and limited to the action possible in the hip 
joint. Fault: leaning to the right; bending the opposite knee. 
3) Left leg backward—raise. Lower. 
The straight leg is raised backward (hyper-extension of the 
hip-joint) with ankle extended. Fault: leaning forward; bend- 
ing the knee. 
The leg may also be raised in the oblique direction outward 
and inward. Leg carrying from one position to another is also 
performed. 
IV. SWINGING THE LEG. 
Swinging differs from raising in the degree of speed involved 
in the movement. An upward and downward movement is usual- 
ly performed in one swing (one count). The leg may, however, 
‘pause in a position as in leg raising. The directions and the 
terminating positions (if used) resemble the foregoing exercises 
of raising the extended legs. 
Examples: 1. Left leg forward and downward—swing. 
2. Left leg forward—swing. Downward—swing. 
3. Left knee upward and downward—swing. 
V. THE STEPPING ACTIVITIES. 
1) . Foot placing. (Fig. 27.)
-P-A-G-E-34
  30 NOMENCLATURE AND TECHNIQUE. 
Left foot forward—place. Replace. 
The straight leg is swung forward, foot about ankle high, and 
then with forcibly extended ankle the toes slightly placed on the 
floor; leg slightly rotated outward; 
weight not transferred; trunk and head 
erect. Close heels firmly in replacing foot. 
Foot placing is executed sideward, 
backward, forward outward, backward 
outward, forward inward, and backward 
inward. There is no outward rotation in 
the sideward and backward placing. 
Fault: slight bending of the opposite 
knee. 
Foot placing may be combined with 
bending the opposite knee. © 
es te ae ne ee backward, bend g opposite knee—place. Re-place. 
(Fig. 27.) 
The leg is swung as in foot placing forward, but backward. 
The opposite knee is bent to about a right angle without raising 
the heel. Chest active and head erect. 
2) Striding. 
Stride left forward—stride. Foot—replace. (Fig. 28, position 1. 
See also Fig. 8.) 
It begins with slight leg swing- 
ing as in foot placing and then 
the foot is placed for a distance 
of twice its length full upon the 
floor, the weight being equally 
distributed on both feet, toes * 
slightly turned” outward, trunk 
and head erect. Striding is per- 
formed in the same direction as 
foot placing. Fault: incomplete 
transference of the body weight.

  LEG EXERCISES 31 
Executed as striding but placing the foot a distance of three 
times its length firmly on the floor. The backward direction is 
seldom used. 
4) Stepping. 
Step left forward—step. Foot—replace. 
Stepping also begins as foot placing, i. e., the extended leg is 
swung forward, toes pointing ankle high, and then the foot is 
placed for a distance of twice its length firmly upon the floor, 
at the same time transferring the weight completely upon the 
stepping leg; the stationary leg is thoroughly extended with heel 
raised and toes lightly touching the floor. It is executed in the 
directions named under foot placing. Fault: incomplete trans- 
ference. 
5) Kneeling. 
‘Place left foot backward and kneel—kneel. Foot—replace. 
The command may be abbreviated to “kneel left.” The left 
foot is placed backward about two foot lengths and then the left 
lnee placed on the floor behind and at the side of the right knee 
into the “single knee stand.” The thigh of the kneeling leg is 
in a straight line with the trunk, which is held erect. The foot 
is either flat on the floor with the toes turned in or the toes are 
curled under the foot. Fault: stooping forward. Return to a 
stand by the strength of the other leg, keeping the trunk erect 
while rising. 
Kneeling is also done from stepping forward. Step left for- 
ward and kneel right—step. Foot—replace. This form of exe- 
cution is seldom used. 
The kneeling position on both knees is described under Leg 
Exercises, Fundamental Positions, 8. (Fig. 24.)

The straight leg is swung forward outward with the toes 
pointing about ankle high, the weight is transferred in the direc- 
tion indicated and the foot placed for a 
distance of about three times its length 
full upon the floor to receive it. The knee 
bends as the foot strikes the floor and 
projects from four to six inches over the 
toes ; the stationary 
foot remains flat 
upon the floor, toes

No. 1: Stride sideward and place hands rear of head—one. 
Bend upper trunk backward and allow body to fall backward— 
two, : 
No. 2: Step for- 
ward and raise arms 
forward—one. © Sup- 
port No. 1 at shoulder

—two. 
Nos. 1 and 2: Re- 
turn movements—3-4. 
The upper trunk 
is forcibly bent with 
chest well raised and 
abdominal muscles 
active. The pelvis 
must not be moved 
forward. The posi- 
tion of the head does 
not change. Fig. 85—Span bend. Raise heels. Arms upward. 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  EXERCISES OF THE THIRD ORDER. 37 
This exercise may be preceded by simpler and followed by 
more difficult positions of the arms. The exercises may also be 
performed with heels locked. Faults: protruding head and ab- 
domen, flat chest, knees bent. 
Il. HORIZONTAL SUPPORT LYING POSITION. (WHEEL- 
BARROW). 
Formation: Open flank couple. 
No. 1: Support lying frontways in two counts with strad- 
dling legs—1-2. 
No. 2: Stride forward and raise arms sideward—one. ‘Bend 
knees and grasp feet of No. 1—two. Raise No. 1—three. 
Nos. 1 and 2: Return movements—four to six. 
The body is about horizontal and in a straight line from 
shoulders to heels. Arching of the lumbar spine must be pre- 
vented. Fault: hanging abdomen, bending knees. 
LE HANDSTAND. 
Formation: Front couples. 
No. 1: Bend right knee and place left foot backward, hands 
on floor—one. Leg swing to hand stand—two. 
No. 2: Face partner—one. Grasp legs and hold—two. 
Easiest in ranks of three, two assisting. 
Nos. 1 and 2: Return movements—3-4. 
A vigorous swing of the straight leg with a forcible push 
from the bent leg brings the body into the handstand position. 
The exercise may be simplified by having No. 2 assist No. 1 in 
obtaining the position. The feet are together, toes pointing, 
knees straight and the trunk slightly arched. 
IV. LOWERING AND RAISING TRUNK WITH PLACING 
ONE. FOOT ON NEIGHBOR'S KNEE. 
Formation: Flank rank couples face to face. 
No. 1: Place foot on partner’s knee with an arm position— 
one. Lower trunk—two. Raise trunk—three, etc. 
No. 2: Lunge forward and grasp ankle of No. 1—one. Hold 
No. 1 steadily during the lowering and raising of the trunk— 
two, three, etc. 
Return movement: In position—stand. 
The stationary leg is kept straight and the trunk held the 
same as in the fundamental position. Trunk lowering with as-

sistance is executed backward and sideward. It may also be 
given forward. Fault: bending lumbar spine in the backward 
lowering, head protruding, chest flat; turning in sideward low- 
ering. 2 
Marching and Walking. 
I. MARCHING FROM PLACE. 
“1) «With a firm step—march, Class—halt. 
Boys and men: The foot is swung forward ankle high with 
the leg fully extended and then placed flat on the floor as the 
weight of the body is transferred to the stepping leg. Girls and 
women: The toes are placed on the floor first followed by the 
heels, otherwise the execution is similar to the foregoing. To 
bring the class to a stand “halt” is commanded as the right foot 
is placed on the floor. The left foot again steps forward and the 
right closes to the left. 
2) With a common step—march. Class—halt. 
The execution differs from that of the firm step in as much 
as the heel of the foot is placed first on the floor and while the 
weight is being transferred the foot gradually rolls on to its 
ball. It is the ordinary walking step. 
In backward marching (only one form) the foot is swung 
backward and then the toes placed on the floor followed by low- 
ering of the heel. For sideward marching, see “Derived Forms 
of Marching.” 
Il. MARCHING IN PLACE. (Two Modes.) 
In place—march. (Mark time—mark.) Class—halt. 
a) With swinging the extended leg forward (ankle high). 
b) With swinging the knee forward just enough to bring the 
foot off the floor. Command “halt”? while the right foot is lifted 
and stop by bringing it to the left. 
In all-forms of marching the head is held erect and the chest 
is slightly raised as in the fundamental standing position, avoid- 
ing, however, an exaggerated position. The arms swing back 
and forth during in place marching and change to a lively pen- 
dulum motion which brings the arms slightly in front of the body 
on their forward swing during the from place marching. This 
more vigorous movement of the arms should assist the body in 
moving from place.
-P-A-G-E-43
  MARCHING AND WALKING. "89 
When marching with a firm step men and women should take 
about 120 steps per minute, while 130-140 per minute are taken 
with the quick common step. This number is increased for chil- 
dren. Faults: too much lateral movement of the pelvis; the for- 
ward knee bent, too much giving the appearance of falling for- 
ward; sliding the foot, very common in the gymnasium; the arm 
swing lacking or often exaggerated; a stiff unnatural swing of 
the arms is acquired. In common step marching thrusting the 
heel against the floor is also to be avoided. 
Ill. MARCHING WITH LEG EXERCISES. 
1) Toe march. On toes—march. 
2) With swinging knee forward—march. 
The knee is swung hip high, bringing the thigh in the hori- 
zontal position with the foot and lower leg directly under the 
knee. The foot is then placed forward with the tranference of 
the weight. It is executed: (1) without changing the rhythm 
of marching; (2) in two counts to each step, knee swinging on 
one and stepping on two, and (3) in three counts, i. e., knee 
swinging on one, leg straightening on two, and stepping on 
three. These exercises are adapted to marching in different 
directions. The knee may also be swung upward. 
3) With leg swing forward—march. 
The extended leg is rapidly swung forward knee high with 
toes pointing and followed by the forward step. It may also be 
executed two counts to each step. 
4). With lunging forward. Lunge-walk forward—march. 
Instead of stepping the pupil moves from place with lunging. 
(See description of lunge.) 
IV. DERIVED FORMS.OF MARCHING. 
1) Closing step. 
Closing step (direction) —march. 
Step as in marching, the weight being transferred to the step- 
ping lég; then bring the’ heel of the other foot to that of the 
active foot. =

  40 NOMENCLATURE AND TECHNIQUE. 
2) Marching sideward with a cross-step. 
a) Sideward with a front cross-step—march (true sideward 
marching.) 
‘It begins with a side step left. The right leg then crosses in 
front with slightly flexed knee. The body weight is carried 
from one foot to the other. The toes are kept turned outward 
to the same angle as in standing. 
b) Sideward with a rear cross-step—march. 
It differs slightly from the preceding one, the leg crossing 
behind instead of in front. 
Jumping. 
1) Stand-jump in place. : 
Raise heels—one. Bend knees—two. Jump upward (feet 
closed, body fully extended) and return to a squat-stand—three. 
Straighten knees—four. Lower heels—five. In alighting the 
knees and- ankles are bent preventing the body from receiving a 
jar. Faults: legs separate, body lacking the arch. After the 
order of the sequence has been learned the command is abbre- 
viated to: Stand-jump in place—one, two, three, four, five. This 
is also done in the following jumping exercises 2-8. 
In grades I-II the stand-jump is performed as a simple exer- 
cise, a jump being executed on each count, as: Eight jumps in 
place—begin, 1-8.   
2) Stand-jump with straddling. 
Raise heels—one. Bend knees—two. Jump upward with 
straddling legs sideward and closing them—three. Straighten 
knees—four. Lower heels—five. 
3) Stand-jump with leg-swing. 
Raise heels—one. Bend knees—two. Jump upward with leg 
swing forward (straight leg) and return to squat-stand, feet 
together—three. Straighten knees—four. Lower heels—five. 
4) Stand-jump with knee swing. 
Raise heels—one. Bend knees—two. Jump upward with 
knee swing forward (or fore-upward) and return to squat-stand 
—three. Straighten knees—four. Lower heels—five.
-P-A-G-E-45
  RUNNING. 41 
5) Stand-jump with foot swing backward. 
Raise heels—one. Bend knees—two. Jump upward with 
foot swing backward (or. back-upward) and return to squat- 
stand—three. Straighten knees—four. Lower heels—five. 
6) Stand-jump from place. 
The same as in place excepting that the body is propelled a 
certain distance in the direction indicated, forward or sideward. 
%) Step-jump forward. 
Step forward—one. Bend both knees—two. Jump forward, 
closing feet (body extended during flight) and return to a squat- 
stand—three. Straighten knees—four. Lower heels—five. It 
may also be executed in four counts, combining counts two and 
three. 
8) Step (leg) swing-jump forward. 
Step forward—one. Jump forward with swinging leg for- 
ward and alight in the squat-stand—two. Straighten knees— 
three. Lower heels—four. It is also executed sideward, begin- 
ning with a front cross-step. 
Running. 
I. RUNNING IN PLACE. (See Marching.) 
In place—run. (Two modes as in marching.) Class—halt. 
The execution is the same as that of marching excepting that 
the body attains momentary flight. To stop the class “halt” is 
commanded as the right foot is placed on the floor. The left is 
again placed on the floor and the right closes to it. 
II. RUNNING FROM PLACE. 
Forward—run, Class—halt. 
The knee is raised fairly high in front, the leg is then straight- 
ened forward and the ball of the foot is placed on the floor with 
the toes pointing straight forward. The rear lower leg is raised 
backward toward the horizontal. The hands are closed to a fist 
and the arms slightly bent immediately with the beginning of 
running, upon the command “run”. The sideward and backward 
running correspond to the sideward and backward marching in
-P-A-G-E-46
42 METHODS AND MANAGEMENT. 
execution, the body, however, attains momentary flight. To 
bring the class to a stand “halt” is commanded as the left foot 
strikes the floor. The right and left again step forward and then 
the right closes to the left. 
Ill. RUNNINGIN AND FROM PLACE WITH LEG EXERCISES. 
a) With swinging knees forward, in place—run. 
b) With swinging feet back-upward, forward—run. 
c) With leg swing forward, in place—run. 
d) With large steps forward—run. 
The rhythm is slower than in the ordinary running. It (d) is 
an exaggeration of the ordinary running stride with the flight in- 
terval increased and the leg reaching forward as far as possible. 
Playforms and Stunts. 
There are certain exercises scattered throughout the material 
of the graded free exercises which are indicated as playforms, 
their movements being of a playful nature. These should be 
frequently made use of in the arrangement of lessons. 
Furthermore, there have been described a number of stunts 
in some of the grades suitable to the ages of the pupils which 
should be taught. These are placed at the end of each age group 
beginning with Grade IV. They are also used in the examples 
of setting-up exercises. Instructors should insist upon pupils 
learning to do a new stunt within a certain period. 
Additional material for stunts may be found in “Health by 
Stunts,” by Pearl & Brown, published by The MacMillan Com- 
pany, New York, which is a collection of old-time stunts. 
METHODS AND MANAGEMENT. 
Alignments. For free, wand and dumbbell exercises various 
formations are used, but the most common are the column of front 
or flank ranks in open order, the circle and the long flank rank. 
The column in open order is obtained by dividing the long rank 
into smaller ones, changing them to a column and then opening 
the ranks. The open front circle is easiest obtainable formation 
for free exercises and is frequently used in the lower classes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  ALIGNMENTS. : 43 
The children are requested to grasp neighbors’ hands, wheel for- 
ward to a circle and open the circle backward by taking a number 
of steps. The hands are then lowered or the grasp retained de- 
pending upon the exercise. The long flank rank is opened gener- 
ally while it is marching about the space although it may be done 
in standing and is used for free exercises in marching and run- 
ning which may or may not be alternated with dance steps. Club 
exercises, because of the space required, are only used in the open 
column formation. a 
The instructor’s position in relation to these formations is 
usually such as will enable him to keep the entire class within 
his vision which is generally in front of the open column, outside

of the circle and in an oblique relation to the flank rank. It is 
not advisable to remain glued to one spot. The instructor should 
move about, even at times observing his class from its rear. To 
change positions too frequently, however, transmits a feeling of 
nervousness to the Glass and should not be done. In exercises 
which constantly cause the class to move from place to place as in
-P-A-G-E-48
  44, METHODS AND MANAGEMENT. 
free exercises performed in marching and running, the instructor 
must of necessity keep changing his position so as to keep the 
class within his vision. 
The Command. The form of the command employed by the 
instructor depends on the object he has in view. Generally two 
forms are used, the sentence form and the noun (or verbal noun) 
form. 
The sentence form is used for the analytical presentation (see 
Forms of Presentation) of exercises, i. e., for the teaching of new 
exercises, and is the only form which should, if at all possible, be 
used for this. It clearly defines each movement of an exercise 
to be performed and signals the pupils when it is to be made. It 
is response work and has for its object among other things the 
learning of the component movements of a complex exercise, 
giving the pupils a clear and concise conception of each detail 
of the exercise. There are, of course, some activities which can 
not be analyzed and must be learned as a group-unit of move- 
ments. If the sentence form is to be used for rhythmic execu- 
tion the command begin follows the analytical presentation. 
Examples of the sentence form: 
1) Turn trunk left and (bend) arms upward—one (or 
bend). Bend trunk forward and (straighten) arms forward— 
two (or straighten). Return movements—three (or arms bend) ; 
four (or arms downward straighten). In complex free exercises 
the activity of the last named part is usually used as a command 
of execution, sometimes that activity upon which the most em- 
phasis is to be placed, and most commonly of all, numerals. If 
the separate movements of this exercise are known the entire 
exercise may be announced and each part taken on the call of the 
numeral, or it may be given as follows: trunk turning left with 
arm bending upward; trunk bending forward with arm straight- 
ening forward and return—one, two, three, four. The last form 
is, however, most frequently used for exercises so well known 
that they may at once be performed in rhythm. 
2) Analytical presentation of the lying support:—Bend 
knees deep and (place) hands on floor—one (or place). 
(Straighten) legs backward to lying support frontways—two (or
-P-A-G-E-49
THE COMMAND. 45 
straighten). Return movements—three (or to squat-stand, 
jump) ; four (or to a stand, straighten). For future repetitions: 
lying support frontways, (noun form) in four counts, one, two, 
three, four, should suffice. 
3) Analytical presentation of the stand-jump: Raise heels— 
one. Bend knees—two., Jump in place—three. Straighten knees 
—four. Lower heels—five. In noun form: The stand-jump in 
place—one, two, three, four, five. 
The noun form is used for analytical presentation of exer- 
cises previously taught and for synthetical presentation of a 
known exercise. Its use for analyzing purposes has been illustrated 
in the above examples. The following example will suffice to illus- 
trate the synthetical application of it: 
Arm-swinging fore-upward and downward—swing, one-two. 
The structure of the command. We have seen from the above 
examples that a command consists of two parts and a pause. The 
first essential in conducting formal work is to tell the pupils what 
they are to do. This is done by the first part or the command of 
explanation. After an appropriate pause, the performance of 
what is to be done follows upon the command of execution. We 
thus need an explanatory command, a pause, and an executory 
command to do an exercise either upon response or in rhythm. 
The explanatory command should give the pupils a clear con- 
ception of what is wanted. 
The pause is adapted to the complexity of an exercise, being 
short in such as are quickly understood and proportionately longer 
in those more involved. 
The executory command is adapted in tone to the nature of 
the activity and should always be accurately timed as to the 
moment of its delivery. 
When applying the structure of the command to free exercises, 
one usually names the lower extremities first, beginning with the 
feet unless turns occur, in which case they are mentioned first. 
The parts used are then named proceeding upward, as trunk, arms 
and head. The general form is 1) activity, 2) part, repeated (if 
many parts are used), 3) direction, indicating left or right, or 
obliquely, if these enter into the structure, before the principal 
directions are named, and finally 4) a numeral as command of  
-P-A-G-E-50
  46 METHODS AND MANAGEMENT. 
execution. If the verb of the activity (or of the activity of the 
last named part if the exercise is complex) is used, it need not be 
named in the explanatory command. (See examples above). 
Voice qualifications. A modulated, correctly pitched and well 
controlled voice is a great help in conducting work and obtaining 
results and should therefore be striven for. Carrying power is 
particularly desirable. The commands should be clearly and 
distinctly enunciated so as to be easily understood, and the tone 
adapted to the nature of the activity, to the size of the class and 
of the room or space in which the class maneuvers. 
In adapting the voice to the nature of the activity one must 
distinguish between the movements performed by sudden jerky 
muscular contractions much like throwing movements, as arm 
extensions, and those which require a slow or moderately slow, 
but forceful, vigorous and complete muscular contraction as arm 
stretchings and postural exercises. The former requires a snappy, 
explosive-like command of execution while the command for the 
latter is drawn out, but forceful, suggesting thorough contraction. 
Between these two extremes lie many activities which do not 
involve either the one or the other type of muscular contractions 
and for which a more moderate tone of voice may be employed. 
It would be waste of energy to use a loud tone of voice if 
one has but to manage a small number of pupils; on the other 
hand a conversational tone would not reach the various members 
of a class of forty or more. Here, too, as well as in the above, 
the instructor should learn to adapt his voice to the size of the 
class and thus save his voice. The same is true in teaching in 
small or large gymnasiums and fields. The voice may be saved by 
correct adaptation and good control. Frequently one’s voice need 
not be much above a conversational tone. In all these applications 
of the voice the correct pitch should be found. 
Correct emphasis on certain parts of the descriptive com- 
mand enables the pupils to more readily grasp the desired exer- 
cise. Thus directions and degrees need to be emphasized if they 
change frequently. If an activity has been frequently performed 
forward and is to be changed to sideward, or if it is possible of 
performance in two directions as left and right, these words 
should receive emphasis.  
-P-A-G-E-51
  
DEMONSTRATIONS. 4y 
Demonstrations. An instructor who can demonstrate with 
skill and finish the activities he is teaching will always find favor 
in the eyes of his pupils. It gains for him their admiration and 
respect and becomes an invaluable aid in discipline and manage- 
ment. 
There is probably no other means, unless it be the contagious 
enthusiasm of an energetic instructor for his work, which will 
arouse as much enthusiasm for and awaken as much interest in 
the work in hand as_a demonstration performed with elegance 
and polish. It is a splendid incentive. The instinct of emulation 
which underlies this enthusiastic response is actively aroused and 
spurs on the pupils to repeated efforts. No instructor can afford 
to ignore the wonderful force contained here. It should be 
utilized to its fullest extent. 
The demonstration of any exercise should be done in the spirit 
of an artist, it should be model-like and perfect in every detail. 
The instructor (or pupil) should never permit himself to become 
slovenly in his execution or present work in a slipshod fashion. 
It is unworthy of one who takes his work seriously. The details 
of an exercise should be shown with photographic clearness and 
the whole rounded off into a performance suggestive of con- 
summate skill and cleverness. 
Such demonstrations give the pupils a clear and correct con- 
cept of the desired activity and make for quick results. Poor and 
faulty demonstrations arouse wrong conceptions, lead to faulty, 
sluggish ‘and slovenly execution and make teaching difficult and 
tedious ; the end in view is not so readily attained as many things 
must constantly be undone. First impressions are hard to erad- 
icate and always insist on recurring. 
Of course, pupils do not on first presentation grasp the cor- 
rect form of the exercise. They can see but vaguely the rough 
outline. Attention must be called to the details and the whole 
gradually unfolded to them part after part as demonstrations are 
repeated. Age and experience, however, modify this procedure 
somewhat. ; 
The instructor’s place of demonstrating should always be a 
conspicuous spot so that every member of the class can see the 
instructor without difficulty when he performs. He must, fur- 
thermore, present all activities counterlike when facing the pupils, 
using his right side when the class is expected to use the left. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  48 METHODS AND MANAGEMENT. 
On the other hand demonstrating while the class is moving 
about a space is best done in the line of march followed by the 
‘class and far enough away so every one may see. 
Occasionally one finds that the class can get the best view 
of an exercise by presenting the side view of it. This is true of 
many, though not of all, such activities as are done in the antero- 
posterior plane as trunk lowering, upper trunk bending, leg rais- 
ing forward, etc., etc. The instructor must select an appropriate 
position before his class to get the best results from his: dem- 
onstration. 
The demonstration may also be used for correcting faulty 
postures and executions by. showing these in an exaggerated way 
to pupils. Tact, however, must be employed when doing this 
since one may unconsciously hurt the feelings of the pupils. It, 
however, frequently enables the pupil to overcome the mistake 
in his exercise. = 
Exercising with the class in rhythmic activities aids in getting 
more energetic executions and perhaps also better form. It spurs 
on to vigorous action. One, however, can not do much of this 
particularly if from five to seven classes are to be taught daily as 
is the case in many high schools. One must save his energy for 
criticisms, suggestions and observation and use it judiciously if 
the work is to be done properly and a breakdown avoided. 
Forms of presentation. Free exercises may be presented to 
students in three ways :—analytically, synthetically, and-in a free 
manner. 
1) The analytical method of presentation consists of separat- 
ing a complex activity into its component parts and presenting 
each part carefully to the class with appropriate pause before the 
next part of the exercise is given,.as, swing arms sideward—1, 
upward—2, return movements—3-4. It paves the way for syn- 
thetic (rhythmic) presentation. 
The response command, i. e., the command of execution (see 
The Command) consists of either a numeral or a word and must 
be adapted to the nature of the activity. If the movement de- 
mands short and quick muscular contraction, the instructor must 
endeavor to have it performed suddenly and immediately upon 
the saying of the command.
-P-A-G-E-53
PRESENTATION. 49 
It should be his object to constantly shorten the reaction time, 
that is, the period elapsing between the word of command and 
the initiation of the movement. A great difference in ability to 
react quickly is at first noticeable among new pupils. The time re- 
quired for the impulse to travel from the ear to the brain, spinal 
cord and muscles after the stimulus has struck the ear-drum is 
clearly perceptible and easily measurable in some pupils. With 
effort on their part and admonitions by the teacher, this soon im- 
proves and the execution of the class as a whole becomes more 
uniform. The reaction need not always be to the stimulus of 
sound ; sight may also be used, the class being asked to react upon 
a movement of the instructor’s arm. 
Concentration is an associated factor of this procedure, for 
a lack of close attention is at once discovered in the late reaction 
and sometimes in doing the wrong thing, the offender bringing 
punishment on himself by the conspicuousness of his blunder. 
The development of the kinesthetic sense is a further object 
in this style of work. Complex co-ordinations cannot be mastered 
by synthetic presentation. They must be gone through piecemeal 
with a sufficient pause in each position so that the muscular feel 
will impress itself on the mind and give rise to motor memories, 
later made permanent by rhythmic repetitions. When thus 
learned, the memory of the movements makes reproduction easy 
and faultless. 
If, on the other hand, one begins with rhythmic (synthetic) 
presentation, unless it be so simple an activity that it must have 
been previously acquired in the common experiences of the pupil, 
the exercise leaves a blurred, muddled and vague memory since 
muscular feelings enter which are not essential to the work, the 
nervous impulses diffusing themselves to many groups of muscles 
not needed; obstructive associations are set up and the recall al- 
ways reproduces these faults. Who is there that has not ex- 
perienced the difficulty of eradicating movements marring a fin- 
ished execution? In analytical presentation there is sufficient time 
to inhibit nonessential contractions and prevent their entering 
into the concept of the exercise. This economizing of energy, 
performing any given activity with just those muscular contrac- 
tions essential, is the ultimate test of a graceful performance.

50 METHODS. AND MANAGEMENT. 
The more memories one has of movements the more readily 
can one perform complex movements synthetically. Thus a well 
trained individual, possessing a large repertoire of such memories, 
can at once pérform complex activities in rhythm. It is this well- 
developed kinesthetic sense that makes for what we commonly 
call grace, skill, cleverness, agility. Its absence is the cause of 
awkwardness, ungainliness and leads to many accidents. It es- 
tablishes correct habits of movements, there being a close economy 
observed, no energy being wasted, no useless or uncontrolled 
movements which shoot beyond the mark. It develops in the in- 
dividual clean-cut action and the habit of precision. In all types 
of exercises where clearly defined movements and accurately 
outlined positions occur, particularly in free exercises and cer- 
tain apparatus exercises, rhythmic execution should not be at- 
tempted until they have been faultlessly performed on response. 
But the rhythmic execution must follow (unless the object of 
the exercise forbids it) and continue an appreciable time (the 
length depending on two factors, the complexity of the exercise 
and the average ability of the class) so that the nerve impulses 
and muscular contractions take place frequently and become per- 
manently memorized. 
2) The synthetic method consists of the immediate presenta- 
tion of an activity in its entirety (without analysis) and is based 
upon the analytic. It is the repetition of exercises analytically 
learned. 
The value of synthetic presentation consists principally in the 
many muscular contractions involved. This is as true of rhyth- 
mic work as of such activities as stunts on apparatus and field 
events which are repeated at intervals. In the former the nature 
of the contractions is different, generally speaking, from that of 
the latter. It is milder and not so forceful. Although certain 
rhythmic contractions may be made rather strong this is not so 
on the whole. On the other hand, apparatus stunts and field 
events always demand rather forceful and even maximum con- 
tractions. If the activities involve large groups of muscles a 
wholesome influence is produced which results in increased mus- 
cular tone, in increased metabolism and consequently increased 
vitality and resistance to disease. The details of these effects are 
given under the physiology of exercise. There is, furthermore,
-P-A-G-E-55
  EXPLANATION AND CRITICISM. 51 
' 
a saving of nervous energy with each future repetition. The 
nerve paths accurately marked out for a certain stunt by the 
analytical presentation are traversed with less difficulty by the im- 
pulses with each repetition and the movements eventually approach 
the automatic type. There is no longer any need of concentrat- 
ing on the complexity of the exercise. It has become part of 
the nervous system, the higher brain cells are relieved of their 
duty and have transferred it to cells of a lower level. 
3) Presentation in a free manner consists of permitting pupils 
to try for themselves, after their own fashion, an exercise which 
has just been analytically presented to the class. It is used as a 
variation of synthetic work and before it is attempted in rhythm 
by the class, but not for all types of exercises. Usually for such 
as are difficult or have a peculiar knack hard to get, as some club 
swings, wand exercises, etc. The class remains in the alignment 
while the individuals are trying the exercise. The instructor can 
not make use of this method in all formations. It gives the pupil 
a chance to work out for himself the problems in co-ordination 
(the instructor, of course, being ready to give assistance when 
needed). and makes him surer of his work when class work in 
unison is resumed. It breaks the prevailing formality and is often 
a welcome change. : 
Explanation and criticism. No teacher of physical education 
can accomplish good results quickly unless he possesses the ability 
to point out accurately the faults occurring in execution and, by 
a few elucidating remarks directly to the point, remedy them. 
This is essential in all kinds of work, formal or informal, in the 
gymnasium, on the playground, or on the athletic field. 
Object. Explanations are often necessary to amplify the com- 
mand and the demonstration in order that pupils receive a clear 
conception of the desired activity. Criticisms are given to point 
out faults, so that the individual execution may be improved; to 
encourage pupils in difficult stunts requiring perseverance or 
courage, and thus bring out these qualities, and to praise or 
censure them as the occasion may require. Both explanations 
and criticisms are used for the purpose of attaining definite gym- 
nastic values by means of some particular activity. 
The command or statement of an activity is scarcely sufficient 
to give the pupils a clear cut mental image of it. Even if re-en- 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  METHODS AND MANAGEMENT. or w 
forced by demonstrations the form often remains vague. This 
is particularly true with children. Their sense of sight has not 
been so developed as to enable them to see all parts of an exercise 
distinctly in one or two observations and the command aids but 
little in obtaining a clear idea of what is wanted, so that explana- 
tions must necessarily follow. 
There are other reasons for elucidation by verbal instructions. 
Adults have no difficulty in getting the mental grasp of the ex- 
ercises, but lack of general body control prevents them from doing 
it. This control is attained by calling attention to the position of 
the various parts of the body. Frequently a knack is contained in 
the stunt that can be explained much better than demonstrated. 
Both of these are, of course, used in the instruction of children 
as well as adults. 
Procedure. The application of explanations is generally as 
follows. A few words of explanation may be given before at- 
tempting an exercise. Thus, when commanding “lower trunk 
forward,” the words “keep the chest up,” or “keep the back flat,” 
may be spoken before the command of execution, “lower,” is 
given. The use of such preliminary remarks depends largely, 
however, on the ability of the class and in some cases may be 
omitted. It is well for the young teacher to have a repertoire of 
such pithy expressions, brief and to the point, meeting all re- 
quirements, and to use the proper ones before important exer- 
cises. They may also be used during and after an execution. It 
is a common fault with the novice, however, to stand before the 
class and explain in a long drawn out speech the complete tech- 
nique of the activity to be attempted, much to the disgust of the 
class members who are anxious for activity. This makes the 
lesson slow and uninteresting. Keeping a class active should al- 
ways receive first consideration. 
The instructor, furthermore, must strive to attain the ability 
of constantly offering suggestions and admonitions to the class, 
providing the activity admits of it, while the class is in action. 
If a fault frequently recurs he should stop the entire class, get 
their attention and then explain how this difficulty may be 
avoided, illustrating his remarks by a polished demonstration. 
To develop good form one should call attention to the main 
points of the principal activity of the important parts of the body
-P-A-G-E-57
  EXPLANATION AND CRITICISM. 53 
involved in the exercise. The correct position of the trunk, the 
relation of an arm or leg position to the trunk and the accuracy 
of the leg movements should each in proper turn receive careful 
attention. This is then followed by centering attention upon the 
movements of secondary importance. Best results are obtained, 
and quickest too, by placing emphasis upon—driving home—one 
thing at a time, by focussing attention upon a single activity. 
By this procedure which, as is apparent, demands frequent 
repetition of the same exercise in a lesson and again at future 
times, considerable co-ordination can be developed. Motor im- 
pulses having again and again travelled over the same nerve paths, 
the inter-play of the muscles involved becomes or closely ap- 
proaches the automatic. 
An occasional digression during an explanation pointing out 
the practical values of exercises, the influence they have upon the 
health, the musculature, posture, carriage, etc., arouses and in- 
creases interest in the work, spurs pupils on to better efforts and 
gains their co-operation. It should never be neglected although 
it is to be borne in mind that it is better to get results by action 
than to merely talk about them. Too much time should not be 
spent upon this. 
Criticism and explanations go hand in hand during instruc- 
tions. To criticize and make the corrections the instructor must 
have an accurate knowledge of the technique of the various 
activities, know the common faults occuring, having the ability 
to observe an entire class rather than just a part, and be able to 
quickly discern any deviations from the correct form, i. e., possess 
the skill to see faults. He usually follows faulty execution by 
correcting the mistake and explaining briefly, if necessary, how 
the exercise should be done. 
Methods. Corrections are best made by (1) positive, short 
and pithy, rather than negative statements, as, keep your head up, 
lift your feet, straighten the knees, etc., rather than, do not droop 
the head, don’t slide your feet, don’t bend the knees, ete. Make 
the pupil think about the thing he is to do and not the opposite. 
(2) A judicious use of praise and censure during and after an 
exercise does not fail to bring improved results and should be 
constantly used. Words of encouragement and praise coming 
from the instructor spur on the conscientious pupils and create 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  54+ METHODS AND MANAGEMENT, 
  a desire to do still better. Extreme and overabundant praise may 
of course, have the opposite effect, hence it should be wisely gov- 
erned. Comparison with other classes or with members of the 
class, pointing to the splendid execution of some one individual 
can be used to advantage in arousing the instinct of emulation. 
On the other hand, it is at times absolutely necessary to censure 
a class, particularly if the performance is clearly below their 
average ability, careless and slovenly. At such times the instruc- 
tor should repeat the work and if improvement is obtained say 
a few words of encouragement. (3) Improved results are often 
obtained by repeating a demonstration, calling attention to the 
fault to be corrected, or by demonstrating the faults, at times, in 
an exaggerated manner. When doing this the instructor must be 
sure to assume the correct attitude toward his class, being careful 
to avoid the slightest suggestion of ridicule, or he will fail entirely 
in his efforts. Repetition after such demonstration improves the 
mental grasp of the exercise and invariably brings results. (4) 
lf such efforts fail, and at other times when the occasion re- 
quires it, the instructor may in many instances use manual ap- 
plication by gently placing or forcing the pupil into-the correct 
position. This gives the pupil the muscular feel of the position 
and is often the quickest way of obtaining a desired result al- 
though it is not always practical or even advisable. It must be 
done with discretion. 
Only practice will develop in the young instructor the ability 
to pick out faults during formal work of an entire class. To do 
this it is necessary to keep it as a whole in the angle of his vision 
rather than to observe just a part of it. He must also learn to 
distinguish between faults made through carelessness and those 
due to lack of strength and skill. The former call for censure 
and remarks should be made directly to the guilty ones while the 
latter call for encouragement. 
Usually remarks bearing on faults and execution are ad- 
dressed to the class as a whole. Individual faults should be 
pointed out, however, to the failing pupil so that the repetition 
which should always follow an adverse criticism will give him 
an opportunity to improve himself while the class as a whole 
strives for better execution. Expression should follow impres-
-P-A-G-E-59
  REPETITION. 55 
sion, as corrections stated and not followed by attempts to over- 
come faults are forgotten and achieve nothing. 
Repetition. In all directed physical educational activities 
reviews are desirable and necessary. They have for their im- 
mediate object the learning of new activities, the attaining of, 
strength, posture and skill, i. e., performing fluent co-ordinations, 
which will broaden the motor power of the individual; further- 
more, the maintenance of skill and strength and general accom- 
plishment previously acquired. These reviews lead to the ac- 
quisition of distinctly outlined mental images of the motor activi- 
ties with firmly linked associations of a wide range giving a broad 
basis to further build upon. There are four methods of repeti- 
tion commonly used; they are: 
(1) Repetition by response, that is, by command of word or 
count; (2) repetition in rhythm, applied only to such activities 
as are performable in rhythm; (3) repetition in a free manner 
and (4) reviews from time to time, particularly of fundamental 
activities and their variations. The first three deal with repeti- 
tions while learning new exercises. Repetitions on response and 
in rhythm also form a part of re-presentation of activities learned 
in a past lesson. 
In order to get a distinct and clean cut mental image of any 
activity, repetition must be followed by criticism (and demonstra- 
tion, see Demonstration) which will point out the faults. Thus 
in repetition by response, faults should be corrected both during 
the execution while the pupil is in some definite position and 
after it. However, it is a mistake to ask pupils to maintain a 
tiring position too long while making corrections, for usually 
while remedying one fault other faults of posture will creep in. 
The duration of a strenuous position must, therefore, be well 
within the limits of the pupil’s strength. Here it is perhaps best 
to make corrections after the execution and merely offer admo- 
nitions during the holding of the position. This kind of procedure 
applies particularly to free exercises. In a free exercise, repeti- 
tion on response must be continued until it is faultlessly executed 
if its full postural value is to be obtained. Movements only per- 
formed in rhythm are not given for postural values. 
(2) Rhythmic execution, wherever this is in place, follows 
the repetition by response. There are many instances, however,
-P-A-G-E-60
  56 METHODS AND MANAGEMENT. 
in which rhythmic repetition is the only kind suitable for the 
particular activity. This is true in some free exercises. The 
number of repetitions of an exercise depends upon the object 
of the teacher and the difficulty of the exercise. Some must be 
often repeated without a pause in order to get the desired effect, 
others less frequently. When rhythmic execution is accom- 
panied by music, as is usually the case, the duration of the activity 
should be adapted to the musical strain. This is true of free 
exercises. If the instructor observes that the execution is poor, 
he should insist upon repetition for the purpose of learning the 
exercise. A difficult combination may require so much co-ordi- 
native power that many repetitions are necessary; on the other 
hand, some will require less. Correct progression, however, will 
not admit of too difficult problems in co-ordination requiring ex- 
cessive time for their learning. These must be led up to gradual- 
ly. Furthermore, the instructor may have in mind certain physi- 
ological effects which he wishes to attain by an exercise. He 
then adjusts the length of his repetitions to suit his purpose. 
Strenuous exercises should not be repeated very long, but may 
be tried again after a pause. Lasting accomplishments can only 
be attained by a number of repetitions, and it is only in this way 
that motor control is gained and that the mental image of the 
activity becomes fixed and clear. 
(3) Repetition in a free manner is not made use of as much 
as it should be. Its principal purpose is to give the pupil an op- 
portunity to try in his own fashion activities which require con- 
siderable skill and sometimes demand an acquisition of a par- 
ticular knack essential in their performance. Such tricks can be 
best learned if the pupil is left to try them out by himself. Oc- 
casions of this kind may arise in teaching difficult free and wand 
exercises, and in peculiar club swings, and it is a welcome break 
in the formal execution and relieves temporarily the attention 
necessary for performing on command. 
(4) Repetition from time to time should place emphasis upon 
fundamental activities. These are reviewed as such and may be 
varied by changing the secondary parts according to the laws of 
progression. Thus certain fundamental exercises of the type 
that will strengthen the large trunk muscles and those of the arms 
and legs should receive attention. The trained instructor is fa-
-P-A-G-E-61
  
= er RHYTHM. 
miliar with the methods used to make these exercises progressive- 
ly more effective and interesting. Other less important exercises 
may be reviewed at greater intervals of the semester’s work. 
The length of the interval between repetition depends upon 
the age of the pupils. In the lower grades the intervals must of 
necessity be short. Children learn quickly, but also forget quick- 
ly, hence there can not be a long interval between re-presentation 
of new activities. As you pass to the higher grades, on the other 
hand, the interval may be proportionately lengthened. 
Rhythm. In free exercises we deal with two quite diferent 
types of rhythmic muscular contractions, first, the fast, sudden, 
or jerky type, and second, the slow, smooth, and even. type. 
There are contractions which lie between these two extremes but 
they may be classified with the one or the other. Both types are 
essential and should receive proper application and considera- 
tion. Studies made by A. Londe, Paris, and given in Schmidt’s 
“Unser Koérper” show the following results: 
In illustrations showing the bending of the arm to thrust and 
the straightening of the arm, first, as a rapid contraction, and 
second, as a slow contraction, the same force of contraction was 
apparent when the arm was halfway, but after the arm had reached 
the final position the result was different. When quickly contracted 
the biceps appeared relaxed as though rebounding from the sud- 
den effort, whereas when slowly contracted it appeared firm and 
compact when the arm was bent to thrust. The same differences 
were noticed in the triceps when the arm was straightened (1) 
with a jerk, and (2) slowly. This seems to prove that in quick 
movements the part of the body acted upon is moved into a posi- 
tion by a throwing-like action, the muscles contracting suddenly 
and in a jerky manner but only momentarily and then immediately 
relaxing again. On the other hand, in slow movements the work- 
ing muscle contracts steadily until the final position is réached. 
The same is true if the muscle stops midway in a position inter- 
rupting the movement. The blood supply will be larger in muscles 
which are slowly and evenly contracted, than in those which are 
rapidly contracted. Sudden, rapid contractions are, however, 
valuable, inasmuch as they occur in such practical daily activities 
as jumping, throwing, striking, and thrusting. Some positions 
can not be attained in good form by a rapid movement, but only 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  
58 METHODS AND MANAGEMENT. 
by the slow, even type of contraction (for example, arms up- 
ward). Hence, rhythm must make use of these two forms of 
muscular contractions as well as the intermediate form, giving 
the body speed, strength and evenness of movement. 
It is furthermore to be noted that rhythmic execution event- 
ually makes movements that are not already so, become half 
automatic or mechanical. This leads to a saving of will power 
to a certain extent and makes the work more recreative, and be- 
cause of musical accompanimerit (a most desirable addition), 
more delightful, the rhythmic beating partly supplacing the voli- 
tional impulse. This does not mean that snappy response work 
which-requires considerable volition should be neglected. On 
the contrary, it must receive equal emphasis. All rhythmic 
muscular contractions, however, whether they be of the snappy 
quick type or the slow type, demand a certain amount of 
effort if they are to be executed with force and vigor. Al- 
though musical accompaniment may be considered an addi- 
tional stimulus it can not™ entirely replace volition in move- 
ments requiring force. There is, furthermore,,a difference be- 
tween the kind of stimuli required for the two forms of contrac- 
tions; the former is the result of sudden innervations of short 
duration but of an explosive nature followed by a release of 
effort, while the latter is the result of a continuous stream of im- 
pulses flowing into the muscle and the will striving to maintain 
this effort. 
That all activities can not be performed in the same rhythm 
is obvious. There are five factors which determine the time 
measure of execution for different activities and for different 
parts of the body. They are: 
(1) Size and kind of body part exercised. 
(2). Range of movement. 
(3) Weight transference. 
(4) Nature of the activities. 
(5) Innate rhythm of pupils. 
(1) Size and kind of body part exercised. The different 
parts of the body vary both in size and weight and consequently 
are limited in their speed of movement. Thus, the forearm can 
be moved more rapidly than the arm or the leg, which in turn
-P-A-G-E-63
  
RHYTHM .: ' 59 
can be moved more rapidly than the trunk in certain activities ; 
likewise, the head must not be moved with much speed for 
obvious reasons. 
(2) Range of movement. Small movements do not require 
as much time for their performance as those of ‘large amplitude. 
Thus foot placing, heel raising, trunk turning, will not require 
as much time as leg and arm raising or trunk lowering and rais- 
ing. This is true regardless of the type of contraction used, i. e., 
fast or slow. 
(3) Weight transference. The rhythms of activities which 
involve weight transference depend upon three phases of this. 
There also is a fourth phase, that of frequency or number of 
transferences, to be considered when applied to progression in 
physical education work, but it has no influence upon rhythm. 
(a) The degree of transference, as partial, half, or whole, 
illustrated in foot placing, striding and lunging. 
(b) The frequency or number of transferences, as found in 
sequences when compared with simple exercises. 
(c) Upon the distance covered in the transference, as 
illustrated in stepping and lunging. 
(d) Upon the speed of the transference, whether it is slow 
or fast. All exercises containing weight transferences eventually 
become semi-automatic because of their rhythmic repetition. 
(4) Nature of activities. The nature of the activity de- 
termines to some extent the rhythm, because elevations are gen- 
erally slower than extensions or flexions and swinging; while 
rotation or circling movements are faster than swaying in free 
exercises. In dancing, stepping and pointing, movements are 
naturally slower than springing and swinging movements. In 
apparatus work we have similar differences. Thus, support 
swinging or swinging in the knee hang does not require as much 
time as hang-swinging. Generally the nature of activities is based 
upon one of the two types of muscular contraction or of an inter- 
mediate type closely approaching the one or the other. 
(5) Innate rhythm of pupils. Every individual has a distinct 
rhythm of his own. Although this difference is very slight in 
persons of the same age, it is easily discernible between children 
and adults. The physical educator must recognize this and set
-P-A-G-E-64
  60 METHODS AND MANAGEMENT. 
his rhythm accordingly. Children possess a tendency toward 
rapid movement which usually does not exist in adults. 
In the practical application of rhythm, we may follow as a 
rule, a procedure of passing from a slow, well-timed, suitable 
rhythm suggested by the nature of the exercises and governed 
by the factors stated above, to a faster rhythm. This will in- 
crease the difficulty in execution. It should be added that this 
can not be applied to all activities. It is only by applying the 
correct rhythm with perfect execution that results desired can be 
obtained. 
Suggestions as to the time-value of different activities follow. 
(a) General exercises, consisting of arm and leg exercises 
in particular, to which in the more advanced grades, trunk move- 
ments may be added, are given for the purpose of. increasing the 
circulation and for accuracy of position. The most suitable music 
for this is of the following rhythms: Fast waltz for heel raising 
and knee bending; polka, march, and one-step for the various 
stepping phases, lunging, etc. 
(b) Postural exercises, consisting of movements intended 
to straighten the dorsal and lumbar spine and poise the head prop- 
erly upon the trunk, and the trunk properly upon the head of 
the femur, are generally performed: only upon command and held 
for some time in position. The object is to give a strong tone 
to the muscle groups actively aiding in maintaining good posture. 
(c) Balancing exercises. The same is true of balancing 
exercises. Both, however, may also be done in slow rhythm. It 
is particularly advisable to occasionally take the balancing move- 
ments which lead from place in this manner. When done in 
rhythm, use some form of moderate or adagio rhythm. 
(d) Rhythmic trunk exercises. consist of bending, straight- 
ening, lowering, raising, and turning of the trunk and are done 
in waltz, polka and march rhythm, using both very slow and fast 
time. The slow tunes precede .and are perhaps best used 
in school work for the large movements caused by slow, forceful 
contractions. Work for adults of advanced ability may contain 
movements of this type in fast rhythm. 
(e) Springing activities consist,of jumping and hopping ex- 
ercises and are done (1) in the pupil’s own rhythm, as the varjous 
stand and step jumps, for instance, and (2) in rhythms commonly
-P-A-G-E-65
RHYTHM. 61 
used for gymnastic dancing; i. ¢., schottische, poika, gailop, ma- 
zurka, waltz, etc., as used for hopping, cutting, swing- and cut- 
hops, stride jumps and the various foot-placings and foot and leg 
swings with hopping. 
(f) Respiratory exercises. These consist of breathing move- 
ments to which are added movements of other parts of the body. 
Here the natural breathing rhythm is followed, ,adapted and 
changed as may be required to fit movements (and sometimes 
with pauses of short duration in position) which are added to 
make breathing deep. These exercises are not given with musical 
accompaniment. 
(g) Wand and dumbbell exercises require the same rhythm 
as the free exercises. The added weight of the wand and dumb- 
bell makes these exercises more suitable for pupils of the junior 
and senior high school. Increased weights are used for adults. 
(h) Club swinging. Waltz rhythm is most suitable for club 
swinging and should be of a fairly fast time. If movements of 
the other parts of the body are added, these must be adapted to 
the club swinging rhythm. A few exercises with the clubs are 
perhaps better performed in polka rhythm, such as straightening 
" arms and striking the clubs, but the swings and circles should not 
be performed in this rhythm. The smooth flowing waltz is the 
most suitable. 
(i) Marching and running. Marching is principally used in 
the form of tactic exercises and to facilitate the moving about 
of the class. We distinguish between two types of steps. (1) 
The common step, with the rhythm of 150 to 160 steps for chil- 
dren and 140 for adults per minute, using march and one-step 
rhythm; and (2) occasionally the firm step with 130 to 140 steps 
per minute for children and 120 to 130 steps per minute for 
adults. In running, a rhythm of 180 to 200 steps per minute is 
used for children, and 160 to 180 steps per minute for adults. For 
this, very fast schottische may be used. ri 
In the arrangement of different kinds of combined movements. 
care should be taken that the various parts composing the com- 
bination possess rhythmic similarity. If this is lacking it will, to 
some extent, mar the performance. It should, furthermore, be 
observed that in all rhythmic execution speed should not be in-
-P-A-G-E-66
  62 METHODS AND MANAGEMENT. 
creased at the cost of correct execution. It is difficult to observe 
faults and good form if the rhythmic execution is too fast. Pre- 
cision of movement and accuracy of position should not suffer 
because of increased speed in the rhythm. 
The pianist. Since the greater part of free exercises is per- 
formed in a dependent rhythm it is most desirable, in fact essen- 
tial, to have a pianist. A few words about the pianist will therefore 
not be amiss.’ She should be a clever player, well advanced in her 
art, alert, good at memorizing music and possessing a varied re- 
pertoire so she can quickly change from one rhythm to another. 
She should have a well developed sense of rhythm to enable her 
to follow the instructor easily and maintain the correct time. 
Ability to accompany all the exercises, even while they are being 
tried out slowly, makes teaching more enjoyable and lends ad- 
ditional pleasure to the work. 
It is advisable that she has ready at hand, or preferably 
memorized, a number of compositions of the different tempi most 
popular in physical education as given above. These she can 
adapt to the different activities, modifying them by placing em- 
phasis where it is needed, so that they will assist the pupil in the 
execution. 
These selections should be from standard and semi-classic 
compositions so as to develop a love for good music in the pupils. 
At times a popular composition may just have the swing needed 
for certain exercises, and although its occasional use may be 
justified because of this or because of it being a great favorite, 
the other types of compositions should predominate. 
Progression. There are a number of rules of progression, 
whose application simplifies instruction and leads to quick results. 
They aid the teacher to move forward in his work step by step, 
making the learning of new movements easier and at the same 
time maintaining interest. Their application also enables the in- 
structor to get more effective results than if he were to present 
his work without any regard for them. He must be able to notice 
in his pupils a constant increase in skill and co-ordination, a 
gradual improvement in muscular tone and strength, as well as 
in speed, endurance and other qualities resulting from physical 
education work, all of which increase vitality and power of re- 
sistance. The following principles are of importance:
-P-A-G-E-67
  
PROGRESSION. 63 
(1) The principle of structure. 
(2) The principle of movements with reference to their re- 
lation to the parts of the body involved. 
(3) The principle of direction. 
(4) The principle of weight transference. 
(5). The principle of equilibrium, or, base and lever. 
(6) The principle of speed and frequency. 
The principle of structure. Most of the activities employed 
in physical education may be analyzed into their component parts, 
consisting in their final analysis of simple movements of the single 
parts of the body. Just as a contractor builds a structure by add- 
ing stone upon stone, so the physical educator gradually builds up 
activities, adding element to element in his teaching process, but 
only after each single part has been thoroughly mastered. He 
should begin with known and pass to unknown movements. This 
means a constant increase in co-ordination and skill, thus grad- 
ully acquiring control of the entire body. To illustrate: in free 
exercises we progress from the simple two-movement exercises 
of one body-part to alternations, then to sequences and so on to 
the more complex forms. 
The principle of movements with reference to their relation 
to the parts of the body involved. This rule also shows the way 
toward a gradual growth of bodily control, and amplifies the 
preceding principle. It is more specific in nature and explains 
more accurately how skill is developed. Thus, it is easier to first 
teach movements which are similar in their nature and of like parts 
of the body as, raising both arms or bending both knees, than 
movements which are dissimilar in nature, but of like parts of the 
body as, raising one arm and bending the other. When considering 
movements with reference to their relation to one another we must 
have at least two movements in mind, and these may be either 
similar or dissimilar in nature. It is quite obvious that progres- 
sion should be from similar to dissimilar movements regardless 
of whether they are performed by two like parts of the body or by 
two different parts. Movements with reference to the parts of 
the body involved progress from like to unlike parts; i. e., it is 
easier to move like parts of the body as both arms or both legs, 
than unlike parts of the body as the arm and the trunk. Briefly

  64 METHODS AND MANAGEMENT. 
stated, the progression is from similar to dissimilar movements of 
like to unlike parts. Although this principle is general in appli- 
cation it is very evident in the free exercises with and without 
hand apparatus. Toga 
The principle of direction. This is of considerable value in 
developing and training the sense of direction. When applied to 
movements of the body from place their difficulty increases in the 
order from forward to sideward to backward. In combined ac- 
tivities where movements of more than one body-part are per- 
formed simultaneously, progression is from like to opposite to un- 
like direction; i. e., two different parts are first moved in the 
same direction, then in opposite direction to each other and finally 
in different directions to each other: e. g. (1) like direction, arm 
and foot movements forward; (2) opposite direction, the arms 
move forward and the foot backward; (3) unlike direction, as in 
foot moving backward or forward and arms moving sideward. 
The principle of weight transference. Transference of weight 
involves consideration of inertia and momentum. Because of this 
it adds toward the development of bodily control, since quick 
starts, sudden stops and rapid shifting of body weight are fre- 
quently demanded. There are four phases of weight transference 
which we must consider. (See Rhythm, p. 59.) 
The principle of equilibrium or of base and lever. Correct ap- 
plication of this rule results in (1) constant growth in muscle tone 
and strength, and an increasingly forceful massage effect, from 
the performance of the various types of trunk exercises; (2) a 
better development of the sense of balance or equilibrium. It 
consists of a gradual narrowing of the base, as bringing the feet 
closer together, thus tending to make equilibrium more unstable, 
and a moderate increase in leverage, brought about by changing of 
arm positions from the sideward to the upward and by adding 
hand apparatus. This tends to raise the center of gravity and 
makes balancing more difficult.’ A practical illustration consists 
of trunk lowering forward in the side straddle stand with arms 
sideward, compared with trunk lowering forward in the close 
stand with arms upward. This illustrates two extremes. Pro- 
gression from the easy to the difficult should, of course, be gradual 
and through a number of increasingly difficult positions.

mH GRADING. 6 
The principle of speed and frequency. This is applied to most 
of the physical education activities and will greatly develop speed 
and endurance which will result in a wholesome influence upon 
heart and lings. The instructor proceeds from slow rhythm to 
rapid rhythm as, changing from arm raising to arm swinging; 
from a slow run toa sprint. If we add to these accelerated move- 
ments an increase in their frequency, that is, if we multiply the 
number of executions, there will be an additional effect gained. 
This is frequently done in such free exercises, as jumping, arm, 
leg and trunk movements, repeated principally for the purpose 
of multiplying the effect of the single movement, but also, to de- 
velop fluent co-ordinations. Speed should not be employed, how- 
ever, at the cost of form in execution, and frequency should not 
be used to the extent of fatiguing the pupil. It is well to bear 
this in mind. : 
The above principle of frequency also includes progressing 
from brief to sustained effort. It is well, however, to also apply 
this to the non-rhythmic work by gradually increasing the dura- 
tion of assumed positions. Each higher age group of pupils should 
be expected to meet increased demands, depending on the rhythm 
the instructor employs. 
Grading free exercises. The important constituents to ob- 
serve in the grading of free exercises are reaction, accuracy of 
position (which includes posture), precision of movement and 
rhythm. The most important are reaction and position, These are 
not so difficult to judge. One reviews several positions upon re- 
sponse, generally arm positions, and observes the speed with 
which they are taken. The resultant positions are at the same 
time judged as to accuracy. Likewise the balance and postural 
exercises (reaction, however, is not considered here). Those 
given in rhythm are also first judged as to position and then 
according to precision of movement and rhythm. Slowness in 
reaction (very evident) ; faults in posture or in any position taken, 
like bent arms in the upward position; drooping head; wrong foot 
positions or arm positions, etc., require deductions in points. The 
exercises used to test the pupil’s ability, are those composing the 
setting-up drills, one of which, beginning with grade IV, should 
be learned each semester. 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  66 METHODS AND MANAGEMENT. 
The best method of marking is to have a small group of pupils 
perform and then another group, etc. The size of the group 
depends upon the ability of the instructor to observe. It is quite 
obvious that grading a class from memory will not give as fair a 
result as this method. 
Wand and dumb-bell exercises are marked in the same manner 
as free exercises, while club swinging is graded according to its 
rhythm and the precision or skill of swinging shown. One pro- 
ceeds as in free exercises. : 
A simpler way of grading the pupils consists of granting points 
for having learned the semester’s setting-up drill (or part of it 
if marks are given oftener than once a semester) and for each 
stunt included in the semester’s (or year’s) list. To these, fur- 
thermore, may be added points attained by being able to repeat 
a stunt (not possible with all stunts) a certain number of times 
and granting additional points (or a point) for each additional 
_ execution. In this manner the pupils will be encouraged to prac- 
tice this valuable type of work. 
This method, however, is not entirely satisfactory as it leaves 
out the consideration of form and tends toward slovenliness: in 
execution. Neatness, and precision of movement, and accuracy 
of position, as well as posture in standing, sitting, walking and 
while exercising, should not be neglected in school work. What- 
ever is worth doing should be done well and if the above quali- 
fications of form are neglected careless habits may be developed. 
It is advisable, therefore, to combine the above two methods.
-P-A-G-E-71
  
ADAPTATION TO AGE-GROUPS. 67 
Suggestions for Adapting Setting-Up Exercises to Various 
Age Groups. 
While free exercise lessons are usually arranged with the four 
values given under Principles of Selection, all of these values 
need not necessarily always be applied to: determine the selection. 
For some purposes one may ignore one or more of these values. 
Thus the postural and co-ordinative values may well be ig- 
nored in selecting exercises for business men and married women, 
or at least receive but passing attention, The condition might 
also arise in grade or high schools in which the time devoted to 
physical education is so limited that only the important essential 
activities can be taught. It would then be unwise to select any but 
those exercises which have a distinct hygienic and postural value. 
Hence the Principles of Selection are to be applied chiefly 
to institutions where full programs of physical education 
can be given. In such places the trained instructor can easily 
arrange complete lessons from the material presented. 
In order to meet the requirements of schools and gymnasiums 
where it is desirable, for some reason, to give but a limited num- 
ber of free exercises, which, however, are to be the most effective 
kind of setting-up exercises, some sample groups are offered as 
suggestions and are placed at the end of Grades VI, VIII, XII, 
and at the end of the advanced work. The instructor may confine 
himself exclusively to their use or arrange additional groups. 
In order to guide the arrangement of such groups, the follow- 
ing viewpoints should be observed: 
(a) Exercises selected for boys and girls from 9 to 12 years 
of age should: 
(1) Strengthen the muscles involved in maintaining posture 
of upper and lower trunk; 
(2) Produce a massage action upon: the abdominal viscera ; 
(3) Increase respiration and circulation of blood and lymph. 
Since free exercises, in most cases, particularly in schools, are 
. done stationary, the room or corridor not permitting much or any 
moving about, it will be difficult to obtain much acceleration of 
circulation. Movements which will serve as substitutes for run- 
ning and jumping must in many cases be selected.
-P-A-G-E-72
    
68 METHODS AND MANAGEMENT. 
(b) Exercises for the adolescent years, including the junior 
and senior years in high school, and beyond to maturity, are 
selected according to the same principles, with increased demand 
of muscular contraction and increased skill, which, however, 
should not offer pure problems in co-ordination. 
(c) For the next group, manhood, a still greater demand 
should be made on muscular contraction so that considerable 
strength is needed to perform at least some of the exercises, and 
a great deal of muscular work accomplished. The exercises may 
also be fairly complex and made to require considerable endurance 
by frequent repetitions. In these years we frequently find a 
tendency toward stiffness in joints, due primarily to the one-sided- 
ness of the daily work. Proper selection of exercises should pre- 
vent this. Postural exercises need not be considered in the 
selection. 
(d) In this, the last age-group, there should be a decrease 
in strenuousness from the preceding group. The number of exer- 
cises can be increased so that on the whole as much work will be 
done as previously, but it should not require as much exertion as 
before. Many exercises should be given to prevent the ever-in- 
creasing stiffness and also—and this is most important—to pre- 
vent the accumulation of fat. This means that carefully selected 
trunk exercises should form the major work of the free exercise 
group. Breathing exercises must be frequently interspersed 
among the others. Postural exercises may be entirely omitted and 
not much skill should be required in the execution of the ex- 
ercises. Setting-up drills must be memorized in each grade. This 
lays foundation for exercising in later life.
-P-A-G-E-73
  
GRADED FREE EXERCISES. 
These exercises are progressively graded and adapted to age 
and sex with due consideration given to the ability generally 
found. Beyond that the arrangement may be said to be arbitrary, 
and justly so, for the progress classes make in this work depends 
very much upon the time devoted to it each day and-the length 
of the course of instructions. In public school work where but a 
few minutes each day are given to free exercises the work will 
have to be graded accordingly. This can be easily done from the 
suggestions offered throughout the material. For gymnastic socie- 
ties certain groups of exercises will be found suitable for the ages 
suggested. In fact, selections may be made from the respective 
grades suited to the ability of such gymnasium classes as are of 
the same ages as the grades. This might also be done for public 
school classes. 
Groups taken up in one class may be continued in their more 
difficult forms in the next class. The trained teacher should find 
no difficulty in grading the material for any class. 
Self-chosen exercises. The pupils should occasionally be 
prompted to perform movements of their own choice. They take 
particular delight in this since it offers opportunity for self-ex- 
pression and initiative, and enter into it with interest and vim. 
Rhythmic executions are preferable and should be accompanied 
by music. The instructor assists the pupil by naming the part 
or parts of the body to be exercised and the structure of the exer- 
cise, e. g., simple arm, trunk or leg exercises; or, simple arm 
exercises in alternation; or, sequent trunk exercises ; or, combined 
exercises of arms and trunk, etc., and after having cautioned the 
class to have their exercise well thought out and be ready to 
begin, has the pianist play an appropriate composition starting 
it with the first movement of the self-chosen exercise on the com- 
mand “begin.” The instructor should follow the performance 
with criticisms as to the form of execution and as to the value of 
some of the exercises chosen. As the class improves the exer- 
cises selected should, of course, increase in difficulty.
-P-A-G-E-74
  70 GRADES I AND II. 
Pupils become more thoroughly familiar with movements and 
their value in this way, and there is laid a foundation for the use 
of free exercises in later life which can well be established as a 
daily habit if the instructor can develop a genuine appreciation 
of this valuable form of activity which can maintain health and 
keep the body in good physical condition. 
Independent rhythmic execution. This form of execution 
consists of the class starting the rhythmic performance of a 
learned exercise upon the usual signal but without either musical 
or voice accompaniment or measured beating of any kind after 
the first three of four counts, each pupil keeping his own time 
measure. It is an excellent test to note the development of 
rhythm in the pupils and should from time to time be employed. 
GRADES I AND II. 
A. SIMPLE EXERCISES. 
These consist of two-movement exercises of one part of the 
body. 
FIRST UNIT. ARM, FOOT, AND LEG EXERCISES. 
I. Arm Elevations. - 
These are movements of the straight arms into definite posi- 
tions which are obtained in two ways, varying in the degree of 
speed of the movements: 1, by raising and 2, by swinging. The 
first being a slow, 'the latter a rapid movement. 
(a) Arms sideward, forward, back-} 
ward. 
Raise |(b) Arms side-upward; fore-up-| Tempo. Raising, 
ward. | slow waltz ; 
Sie (c) Arms obl. fore-upward. swinging, polka 
(d) Arms obl. side-upward. rhythm. 
(e) Arms obl. fore-downward. 
[ (f) Arms obl. side-downward. 
Some of the above exercises may be combined with hand 
clapping. ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  
SIMPLE EXERCISES. 1 
Commands: Arms backward—raise.. Lower. (Fig. 12.) 
Arms fore-upward—swing. Downward—swing. (Fig. 13.) 
If execution upon command is to be followed by a rhythmic execution, 
the command “begin” is given, preceded by the words “in time.” To stop 
execution in rhythm command “halt” on the first movement (on an odd 
count) of the last execution. Only the principal oblique positions are 
given. These should only be taught to children of higher grades. 
The arm movements fore- and side-upward ‘should be done with the 
single arm first, then in alternation, and finally with both arms. 
II. Flexed Arm Positions. 
(a) Place hands on hips. (Fig. 17.) 
(b) Place hands in front of shoulders. (Bend arms for- 
ward.) (Fig. 21.) 
(c) Bend arms for (to) thrust. (Fig. 19.) 
(d) Bend arms upward. 
(e) Bend arms to strike. (Fig. 20.) 
(f£) Place hands rear of head (neck). (Fig. 18.) 
(g) Bend arms to strike from head. (Fig. 22.) 
Tempo: polka or fast-waltz rhythm if rhythmic exe- 
cution is desired. 
(h) Raise arms sideward, forearms forward. 
(i) Raise arms sideward, forearms upward. 
(j) Starting positions (a-i) alternated rapidly on command, 
also preceded by hand-clapping. 
Command: Hands on hips—place. Hands—replace. 
Clap hands and arms for thrust—bend. 
Clap hands and arms downward—straighten. 
These positions are mainly used as starting positions from which 
exercises of other parts of the body, as well as the arms may be executed. 
The complex starting positions may be taken up in the higher grades in 
public school work. The positions “hands on hips” and “hands rear of 
head” are chiefly used to fix the hands while performing movements of 
other parts.
-P-A-G-E-76

These exercises are first given as balancing exercises on command 
and after.good control is acquired, in rhythm. 
VII. The Stepping Activities. 
Foot placing 
Striding + directions as in leg swinging. 
Stepping ne 
Straddling, forward, sideward, backward, back- and fore-

Examples and Commands: Left foot sideward—place (1). Re- 
place (2). Waltz and polka rhythm. 
Stride left forward—stride (1). Replace (2). Waltz 
rhythm. 
Step left fore-outward—step. (1). Replace (2). 
Chiefly on command. 
The stepping activities are named according to the amount of weight 
transference taking place; foot-placing, no transference; striding and 
straddling, half transference; stepping, complete transference of weight. 
The rhythmic execution must be adapted accordingly. The three prin- 
cipal directions, forward, sideward and backward, should be emphasized 
in these grades and taught in the order named. The oblique directions 
are of lesser importance. The terminating positions are named, touch- 
step stand, stride-stand, straddle-stand and step-stand. 
Nore.—A fter executing an exercise left 8 or 16 counts in rhythm, foot 
placing for example, the instructor may change to execution right with- 
out pausing by commanding “right” on seven (or 15) and “begin” on 8 
or 16. This may be done in all cases where an exercise is executed in 
two directions. 
VIII. Exercises from a Starting Position of the Legs. 
(a) From (the touch-step stand) foot-placing: 
Place the foot in the same, opposite, or unlike direc- 
tion. 
Raise or swing the flexed or extended leg. 
Examples and Commands: From forward foot-placing: 
Foot forward—tap (like direction). 
Foot backward—place (opposite direction). Forward 
—place. F 
Foot sideward—place (unlike direction). Forward—

Return. Heels—raise. Lower. 
Tempo: Waltz rhythm. 
IX. Exercises in Walking. 
Before teaching exercises in walking it is necessary to 
teach walking itself. Teach the “Common Step” first and 
call attention to the following: 
To size and rhythm of the stride. 
To placing of the foot. 
To the movement of the legs. 
To the movement of the pelvis and trunk. 
To the posture of head and chest. 
To the movement of the arms. 
Later teach the “Firm Step,” calling attention to the 
same points. Do not attempt to teach too many points in 
one lesson but begin with one or two and add from day 
to day. This is to be observed throughout the grades in 
all walking or marching exercises. 
(a) Foot and leg exercises. 
Examples: 
1. Marching with stamping on a given step. 
To promote rhythmic marching and develop 
rhythm. 
March with stamping on the first of every four or 
two steps, and later of every three steps. 
2. Walking on toes, toe-walk. (March of tall men.) 
Walking on heels. 
4. Walking with bent knees. (March of short men.) 
The exercises are to be adapted to marching in 
various directions. 
Commands: On toes—march. Common (firm) step 
—march. With stamping left—march. Common 
(firm) step—march. <2 
(b) Arm exercisés. 
Examples: 
1.. Marching with hand-clapping in place of stamping 
as under 1.
-P-A-G-E-80
76 GRADES I AND II. 
Both the clapping and the stamping may be used 
simultaneously or alternately occasionally. 
Marching. with neighbor’s hands grasped (front 
rank) and changing on a command or on a given 
step. Promotes the ability of keeping correct 
distance. 
3. Arm movements as given under I, 1, 2 and 3. 
Execution on command is taken up first; later ex- 
ercising in time, with a movement on the first of 
» each 4 (or 2) steps, should follow. ~ 
Command: Swing arms fore-upward—swing. Downward— 
swing. Given either while the long flank rank is 
standing or while moving around the hall. 
A movement on the first of four steps—begin 
(given on the left foot) ; the exercise begins with 
the next left step when marching forward. 
With clapping (and stamping) on the first of three 
step—imarch. The counter command for both ac- 
tivities would be: without the exercise—march, 
unless the class is to be brought to a stand in 
which case “Halt” is given on the right foot. 
Tempo: March rhythm. 
X. Exercises in Running. 
Before attempting exercises in running this itself 
should be taught. Teach all such movements as will assist 
in developing speed and point out the differences when 
running long distances for endurance. Call attention to 
and teach the following: 
Size of stride and rhythm. 
Placing the foot. 
Leg movements. 
Trunk and pelvis movements. 
Arm movements. 
Place emphasis upon one thing at a time and gradually 
add the others. 
(a) Leg and foot exercises. 
Running with stamping (or clapping, or both) on 
a given step, same as under “Exercises in Walk- Lees, ing
-P-A-G-E-81
SIMPLE EXERCISES. 
2 = 
(b) Arm exercises. 
Repeat the arm exercises given under I, 1, 2, 3. The 
exercises may be executed with a movement on the 
first of 8, 6, and 4 steps. 
Commands: Swing arms sideward—swing. Downward—swing. 
A movement on the first of 8 steps—begin. 
Without the exercise—run. 
_ Tempo: Schottische (fast) or gallop rhythm. 
SECOND UNIT. HEAD EXERCISES; UPPER TRUNK 
BENDING AND TRUNK LOWERING. 
I. Head Exercises. 
(a) Lowering head forward, sideward, backward. 
(b) Head turning left and right. 
Command: Head backward—lower. Raise. 
Turn head left—turn. Return (or forward turn). 
Tempo: Waltz rhythm if rhythmic execution is 
desired. 
II. Upper Trunk Exercises. 
Bending the upper trunk backward. 
Upper trunk bending should not be begun until 
head lowering backward can be correctly performed. 
Command: Upper trunk backward—bend. 
Hands placed on hips and repeat. 
Assume some starting position of the legs which 
will either increase or decrease the base, and re- 
peat, as: 
Stride-stand (sideward, forward). 
To get the best effect from these exercises they should only be given 
on command. Repetitions of upper trunk exercises with an arm and leg 
starting position should increase the difficulty of the execution gradually 
and is continued with difficult starting positions in the higher grades 
(intersected exercises, grades III and IV and grades V and. VI). 
Command: Left  sideward—stride. Upper — trunk—bend 
Straighten. 
Hands on hips—place. Upper. trunk—bend. 
‘ Straighten. Hands—replace.
-P-A-G-E-82
    
~ ow GRADES I AND II. 
Ill. Trunk Lowering. 
Command: Trunk forward (halfway )—lower. Raise. 
These exercises are repeated in the straddle and stride-stand. 
The remarks about increasing the effect of upper trunk bending 
also apply here. 
THIRD UNIT. BALANCE EXERCISES. 
See exercises in the fundamental position (I, 5 and 6) as: 
Toe stand; bent knee stand (squat stand) ; and flexed and ex- 
tended leg elevations. 
These balancing exercises are only given on command. Ad- 
monitions and corrections should be made while holding a posi- 
tion. Pupils balance best by looking at a point lying in front 
of them and on a level with their. eyes. 
FOURTH UNIT. ANTERO-POSTERIOR TRUNK 
EXERCISES. 
I. Trunk Lowering. 
Trunk lowering may be omitted here in a-lesson if 
given under II. 
Lower trunk forward, halfway; forward; and fore- 
downward. 
If. Trunk Bending. 
(a) Bend trunk forward and fore-downward. 
(b) Bend trunk backward. 
Command: Hands on hips—place. Trunk forward—bend. (1). 
Straighten (2). 
Assume some starting position of the legs which 
will either increase or decrease the base, as: 
Straddle or stride-stand (sideward, forward). 
Adding arm or leg starting positions to the trunk exercises may either 
be omitted or the most simple ones selected for the work of these grades 
and progressively taken up in the grades above these. Trunk bending 
backward is inserted here because it is a two-movement exercise, but on 
account of the difficulty of its execution is best not taught except in the 
higher grades after good control has been acquired in upper trunk bend- 
ing. Refer to II of second unit for commands. ’

SIMPLE EXERCISES. 79 
FIFTH UNIT. IMITATIONS OF VARIOUS ACTIVITIES. 
The exercises enumerated under the various units of the free 
exercises may be made more interesting in the first three grades 
by naming the play, animal, or vocational activities which they 
resemble. It is advisable to have some special imitations, of 
which a fair variety is given in this unit, in each lesson. A lesson 
in free exercises of the lower grades need not consist of as many 
units as one of the higher grades; some units may be 
combined while others may be omitted. If the lesson is too short 
for the higher grades, the exercises under unit I may be repeated,

GRADES III AND Iv. 
Cc. ALTERNATIONS OF TWO EXERCISES OF 
SIMILAR AND DISSIMILAR PARTS. 
Two exercises given under the previous units of Grades I 
and II are alternated, care being taken to select appropriate 
examples, choosing movements of similar rhythm. Alternations 
are not appropriate in all of the units. The suggestions given 
below can be readily enlarged upon by referring to the groups 
from which they are taken. 
  FIRST UNIT. ARM AND LEG EXERCISES. 
I. Alternations of Similar Parts. 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
(f) Two flexed arm positions. 
Two arm elevations. 
Two arm extensions. 
Alternations of (a) to (c) with each other. 
Command: Bend arms to strike and swing arms 
fore-upward alternately—begin. The alternation 
may also consist of four of each. 
Two exercises in the fundamental position. 
An exercise in the fundamental position and a flexed 
or extended leg elevation or a foot-placing. 
Command: Place left foot sideward and swing left 
knee (foot, or leg direction), alternately—1-2-3-4. 
Tempo: Fast waltz and polka rhythm. 
II. Alternations of Dissimilar Parts. 
The exercises are selected from the above (1), arm 
and foot or leg movements alternating with each other. ~ 
Examples and Commands: Arms upward—bend. 
(Starting position. ) 5  
-P-A-G-E-88
84 GRADES III AND IV. 
(a) Straighten arms sideward and place left foot side- 
ward alternately—1-2-3-4, etc. 
(b) Strike sideward and swing left leg sideward alter- 
nately. 
(c) Swing arms fore-upward and left knee forward alter- 
nately. 
The alternations are developed with children as fol- 
lows: 
Left arm and leg alternately eight counts. 
Right arm and leg alternately eight counts. 
Both arms and left and right leg alternately 
16 counts. 
A pause is made after each 16 counts and then the 
32 counts are repeated without pause. 
Tempo: Fast waltz or polka rhythm. 
The co-ordinative difficulty is increased by changing the relative 
direction of movements from like to opposite to unlike direction. The 
examples given are of like direction. Arm straightening forward and 
foot placing backward involves opposite direction. Arm straightening 
sideward and foot placing forward or backward involves unlike direction. 
FOURTH AND SIXTH UNITS. TRUNK EXERCISES. 
Alternations of Dissimilar Parts. 
Alternation of Trunk with Arms and Legs. 
(a) Trunk bending or lowering and arm raising. 
(b) Trunk turning and arm extensions. 
(c) Trunk turning and leg swings.

D. ENCHAINED (LINKED) TWO-MOVEMENT 
ARM EXERCISES. 
These exercises are executed in such a manner that one arm is being 
extended while the other is being flexed, or one is swung upward while 
the other is swung downward. I. Arm Swinging is given: a) Fore- 
upward, or side-upward and downward, and b) Backward and forward. 
Il. Arm Extension and Flexion is given as follows: a) Striking, thrusting, 
or straightening and bending. Command: Left arm fore-upward—swing.

E. SIMPLE INTERSECTED EXERCISES. 
These exercises consist of a two-movement exercise of two 
parts arranged in sequences of four (or three) movements. 
Performed thus the exercise is executed in a limited manner; 
e., it is limited to three or four counts. It may, however, also 
be performed in unlimited execution, in which case the second 
and third movement is repeated in the position obtained from the 
first movement an indefinite number of times either upon com- 
mand or in rhythm. The exercises are given left (8 counts) 
right (8 counts), and in alternation (16 counts). If alterna- 
tions are too difficult rhythmic execution may be confined to the 
left and right side. 
Trunk movements are chiefly given in this way. The simple 
intersected exercises lend themselves excellently to a progressive 
adaptation of trunk movements by adding arm or leg (simple) 
starting positions. 
Example of unlimited execution: 
Stride left sideward—stride (starting position). 
Lower trunk forward—lower. Raise. Repeated indefinitely 
in rhythm or on command. Foot—replace, or in position—stand. 
Other trunk movements may take the place of the lowering. 
Example of limited execution: 
Stride left sideward—1. Lower trunk forward—2. Return 
—3-4, 
In order to increase the effect by having the trunk move- 
ments more frequently repeated before replacing the foot, the 
limited execution may be changed to an exercise of eight counts. 
This is done by performing the trunk exercises three times, 
Example: (Hands on hips) Stride left sideward—1. Lower 
trunk forward—2. Raise—3. Repeat 4 to 7. Re- 
place foot—s. 
This arrangement is suggested here, but is used more appro- 
priately in the higher grades.

FIFTH UNIT. SPECIAL EXERCISES OF SKILL. 
Appropriate exercises of grades I and II may be repeated 
here, or exercises as given under unit I (arm and leg) may be 
repeated. 
In grades above these the unit will be frequently omitted. Its 
use in a free exercise lesson depends upon the general arrange- 
ment of the lesson and upon the purpose in view and may or may 
not be omitted. 
(1) Fall to a squat-stand, hands on floor. 
(2) Fall to a squat-stand right, placing left foot back- 
ward or sideward. 
(3) Fall to a seat, legs crossed, with and without using 
hands. Jump to a stand. 
(4) Fall to lying rearways through the seat with legs 
crossed. Return to the stand in the same 
manner. 
These exercises are intended to develop quick reaction. A 
sudden execution should therefore follow upon command of 
word or numeral. 
SEVENTH AND EIGHTH UNITS. SPRINGING EXER- 
CISES. BREATHING. 
The exercises of the previous grades may be reviewed here. 
Jumping into’ stride-stands followed by arm swings or extensions 
could be placed under this unit, though they are not pure jump- 
ing exercises. 
Example: Jump to side stride-stand—1. Swing arms side-up- 
ward (clap)—2. Return—3-4. 
The following exercises may also be practiced here: 
Playform—The hopping couples: Flank couples facing each 
other one step distance. Grasp neighbor’s raised leg (at ankle), 
place other hand on neighbor’s shoulder and hop in and from 
place; with whole wheel left (right) about center; with chang- 
ing positions on a certain count.
-P-A-G-E-99
  
COMBINED EXERCISES OF SIMILAR PARTS. 95 
Command: Place left hand on neighbor’s right shoulder and left 
leg forward—raise (grasp ankle). Eight hops in 
place (sideward, etc), and change positions—begin 
(1-8. Change, 2, 3, etc.). 
Tempo: Polka to schottische rhythm. 
F. COMBINED EXERCISES OF SIMILAR PARTS. 
These exercises consist of two different activities of similar parts (or 
of the trunk) performed simultaneously. They are placed under the 
different units in G, Two-Part Combined Exercises. They consist of: 
I. Combined Leg Exercises; such as a) Leg elevations with bending 
stationary knee. b) Leg elevations with raising stationary heel (fast 
rhythm). c) As a and b, but foot placing instead of leg raising. 4d) 
Kneeling on one or both knees from placing and from fundamental posi- 
tion respectively. e) Lunging (developed under four-movement sequences 
of.legs). Commands are given as follows: 1) Place left foot sideward 
and bend right knee—1. Return—2, 2) Kneel left—l. Return—2. This 
is performed by foot-placing backward into the kneeling position. Kneel- 
ing may also be done from striding forward. This necessitates a longer 
command (stride left forward and kneel right). (The backward lunge 
should be omitted.) 3) Left fore-outward—lunge. Replace. Tempo: ° 
Waltz and polka; two counts to a movement or mazurka for lunging. 
II. Combined Arm Exercises, such as:.a) Flexion of one and elevation 
of the other arm. Command: Bend left arm to thrust (strike) and right 
arm sideward—raise. Lower. And, b) Arm extension and elevation in 
opposite and unlike directions. Command: 1) Left arm fore-upward and 
right backward—swing. Return—swing. 2) Left arm upward and right 
downward—thrust. Bend. 38) Left arm upward and right sideward— 
straighten. Bend. Tempo: Polka rhythm. III. Combined Trunk Ex- 
ercises, as turn and bend or lower trunk. Command: Trunk left obliquely 
forward—bend (lower). Straighten. The more difficult forms are given 
as trunk sequences under H. Tempo: Waltz rhythm. 
G. TWO-PART COMBINED EXERCISES. 
These exercises consist of two-movement exercises of two 
parts executed simultaneously. Combined exercises should be 
composed of stich two-movement exercises as have been thor- 
oughly mastered. Poor execution demands a review of the com- 
ponent parts, either as alternate exercises, or as simple inter- 
sected exercises. After the combined exercises have been 
learned singly they should be repeated bilaterally as “Combined 
Exercises in Alternation” and also as two different combined 
exercises in alternation. They assist in developing skill and in 
keeping the class attentive. .

  96 GRADES III AND IV. 
The following procedure should be followed throughout: 
(1) Raise heels and swing left arm side-upward 8 
counts. With right 8 counts, and with both 
arms 16 counts. 
(2) Place left foot sideward and straighten left arm 
sideward 8 counts. Right 8 counts and both 
arms with alternate foot placing 16 counts. 
(3) As 2, but turn trunk instead of placing foot. If 
the single execution is well learned the pupils 
may change from left to right and alternate 
(both) execution without pausing (on com- 
mand), if not, the alternations should be taken 
up. later. 
FIRST UNIT. ARM AND FOOT OR LEG EXERCISES.

H. ONE-PART SEQUENT EXERCISES. 
The sequent exercises of these grades comprise mostly four 
movements. They consist of an initial movement leading to a 
definite position (the first), an intermediate movement leading 
to a second position, another intermediate movement which is 
the reverse of the one preceding, leading again to the first posi- 
tion, and a final movement leading to the starting position. The 
two intermediate movements may be frequently repeated in 
rhythm or on command before the final movement is given (un- 
limited execution). Some of the jumping exercises have five 
movements. The sequences given here vary so much in difficulty 
of execution that some of them may be given in the lower, while 
others should be reserved for the upper grades.

GRADES V-VI. 
The 34 to 1-pound dumbbell of wood may be taken up in this 
grade. All forms of arm exercises can be executed unaltered 
with the additional weight of the dumbbell. Particularly valuable 
are those to which the shape of the dumbbell is adapted, such 
as striking, thrusting, turning and swinging of the arms as well 
as clicking of the dumbbells. 
The wooden wand, 1 inch in diameter and from 32 to 36 
inches long, should also be taken up in these grades. See “Wand 
Exercises.” 
I. SIMPLE EXERCISES IN SERIES AND COM- 
BINED EXERCISES IN DIVIDED ORDER. 
Execution in series is given chiefly for the purpose of review, 
therefore, essential exercises should be selected. As they demand 
considerable memorizing they should not be too frequently used ; 
in fact, they can be omitted in regular school gymnastics on this 
account. They are inserted here to make the “Free Exercises” 
complete. Only examples of the first unit are given; if exer- 
cises for the other units are desired these suggestions will aid 
in their arrangement.   
FIRST UNIT. ARM, FOOT, AND LEG EXERCISES. 
I. Arm elevations and extensions. 
Wands and dumbbells may be used for these repetitions. 
Examples: 
(a) Swing arms backward, sideward, foreward, side-up- 
ward, in eight counts (add hand-clapping). 
(b) Thrust or straighten arms backward, sideward, for- 
ward, and upward, in eight counts. 
Tempo: Polka rhythm.
-P-A-G-E-116
  
112 GRADES V AND VI: 
II. Leg exercises. 
Examples: 
(a) Swing left and right leg forward, and sideward. 
(b) As (a), but place foot, bending opposite knee. 
Tempo: Polka or fast waltz rhythm. 
(c) As (a), but lunge. 
Tempo: Mazurka or waltz rhythm. 
These exercises may be further varied by alternating arm 
with leg exercises, or trunk exercises with either arm or leg 
exercises. There should be rhythmic similarity of the different 
exercises when such alternations are made. 
III. The combined exercises reviewed in divided order. 
That is, the files execute their exercises in opposite and unlike 
direction to each other. 
| Examples: 
(1) Raise heels and straighten arms upward—1-2. 
Bend knees and straighten arms sideward—3-4. 
Files 1 and 3 begin with raising heels, and files 
2 and 4 begin with bending knees. 
(2) Bend trunk backward (or lunge backward) and 
raise arms fore-upward—l-2. Lower trunk 
forward (lunge forward) and raise arms side- 
ward—3-4. Proceed as under 1. 
(3) Lunge sideward and thrust sideward—1-2. 
Bend trunk backward and straighten arms up- 
ward—3-4. Proceed as under 1. 
The arms may also move in opposite or unlike direction to 
each other. 
(4) Lunge left sideward and strike left oblique side- 
upward and right opposite—1-2. Right—3-4. 
The files begin toward each other. 
These exercises are to be arranged under the respective units of the 
outline of free exercises and occasionally used as a means of diversion. 
Selections from the following alternations may also be made: alternations 
of combined exercises and facings, and alternations of combined exercises 
and marching in and from place.

COMBINED EXERCISES INTERSECTED. 113 
IV. Special exercises of skill. 
(a) Falling to squat-stand on both or one foot, the other 
foot being placed sideward or backward, and the 
hands in front of body. The same with the hands 
one or two steps distant. 
(b) Fall to seat with legs crossed, with or without the 
assistance of the hands. 
(c) Fall to lying rearways through the seat with legs 
crossed. Rise in the same manner. 
J. COMBINED EXERCISES INTERSECTED. 
These exercises consist of two-movement exercises of three 
parts arranged as four-movement sequences. The initial move- 
ment consists of two parts, the two intermediate movements of 
a single part, and the final movement of two parts. 
Because of the change of base and of arm positions possible 
they are particularly adapted for trunk movements, admitting 
of careful progression, and are performed like the simple inter- 
sected exercises of Grades III and IV (E) in (1) unlimited and 
(2) limited. execution. 
Example of (1): 
(1) Step left forward and arms sideward—raise. Up- 
per trunk—bend. Straighten. Repeat several 
times. Left foot—replace (or in position— 
stand). 
Example of (2): 
(2) Stride left sideward and place hands rear of head. 
Bend trunk fore-downward. Return movements. 
There are no exercises of units, I, VII, or VIII given. 
In the higher grades these exercises may be arranged in 
sequences of eight movements; e. g., the position named above 
(2) is assumed on 1, the return movement to the fundamental 
position is executed on 8, and the trunk bending on 2 to 7. 
In all cases the foot or leg movement is executed first so as

SECOND UNIT. UPPER TRUNK BENDING AND 
TRUNK LOWERING. 
I. Arm, leg and upper trunk exercises. 
The leg movement is executed first to establish a base. The exer- 
cises are only given on command. 
Foot placing, striding, stepping, arm flexion 
Foot placing, bending opposite knee, ‘with J arm elevation 
Lunging, kneeling on one knee, [arm extension 
below or to a horizontal position; later above a horizontal posi- 
tion; followed by bending upper trunk backward and return 
movements. 
Examples: 
(a) Place left foot backward and bend arms to thrust 
(or upward). Bend upper trunk. Return move- 
ments. 
(b) As (a), but step left forward and straighten arms 
sideward or place hands rear of head. 
(c) As (a), but stride left sideward and strike obliquely 
side-downward. 
(d) As (a), but place left foot backward, bend right knee 
and raise arms sideward. 
(e) As (a), but lunge left fore-outward and bend arms to 
strike or strike obliquely side-downward. (Fig. 
29.) 
(f) As (a), but kneel left and raise arms sideward, 
palms upward. 
When giving exercises in an unlimited manner the position of the 
feet may be changed from left to right without lowering the arms. 
Command: feet—change 1-2. 
II. Arm, leg and trunk lowering exercises. 
The procedure is a precise repetition of the upper trunk 
exercises with trunk lowering forward substituted. Exercises 
in foot placing, also with bending opposite knee, and in stepping 
should be omitted as they offer too insecure a base. A trunk 
lowering should follow each upper trunk movement.

K. SIMPLE EXERCISES INTERSECTED BY 
COMBINED. 
Two-movement exercises of three parts are arranged as four- 
movement sequences. The initial movement consists of one part, 
the two intermediate movements of two parts, and the final move- 
ment of one part of the body. They are used principally for 
trunk and balance exercises. These exercises follow the preced- 
ing group of “Combined Exercises Intersected” in correct pro- 
gression since in the latter an arm and leg position is assumed in 
which a trunk movement is performed and in the former the 
trunk movement and arm movement into a position occur simul- 
taneously. In all cases the initial movement is always a leg- 
movement so as to establish a base for the trunk exercise or for 
the balancing. Limited and unlimited execution. These exercises 
may also be arranged as eight movement sequences like those of 
the previous group. 
FIRST UNIT. ARM, HEAD, FOOT AND LEG

Exercises under this unit are omitted. If they are desired 
for any purpose suggestions as to their arrangement may be ob- 
tained from the units following.

L. TWO-MOVEMENT ENCHAINED OR LINKED 
EXERCISES OF TWO AND THREE PARTS. 
Linked exercises are those in which the second movement of one part 
(or of two parts) occurs simultaneously with the first movement of an- 
other part. Observe direction. They are best suited for rhythmic execu- 
tion. The units, performed only on command are therefore omitted. 
1) Foot, leg and arm exercises: Arm elevation and arm extension and 
return movements with squat-stand, foot-placing, lunging, etc. 2) Head, 
arm and leg exercises: Arm and head movement on 1; returning them and 
leg movement on 2. 3) Arm and antero-posterior trunk exercises: An 
arm movement on 1, return and a trunk movement on 2. 4) Leg, arm and 
antero-posterior trunk exercises: A leg and arm movement on 1, return 
movements with a trunk movement on 2. 5) Arm and lateral trunk ex- 
ercises: An arm movement on 1, returning and a trunk movement on 2. 
6) Leg, arm and lateral trunk. exercises: A leg and arm movement on 1, 
return movements with a trunk movement on 2. 7) Arm and leg exer- 
cises in springing: Jump to side, forw. or cross stride-stand on 1. Jump 
to position with arm elevation or extension on 2. 
M. AUGMENTED SEQUENCES. 
These consist of a sequence (generally four movements) of 
one part and a two-movement exercise of a second part. If the 
initial movement comprises one part, the two intermediate move- 
ments will consist of two parts of the body and vice versa. The 
final movement is similar to the initial. 
These exercises are also to be given in unlimited and limited 
execution. Examples for all the units are contained in this 
group. Care should be taken, however, to select the effective 
ones. 
They may also be arranged as six- or eight-movement 
sequences, but these are best reserved for the higher grades.

Examples: 
(a) Marching forward with placing the stepping foot 
with or without bending opposite knee as first 
movement, raising the leg forward as second and 
stepping forward as third movement, e. g., place 
left foot sideward with bending opposite knee on

2, and step on 3. Same right 4-6. Begin, 1-6. 
(b) Marching backward with the above named exercises. 
(c) Marching sideward with the closing-step with the 
above named exercises, four counts to each step. 
Remark. Two foot placings preceding each walk- 
ing step may be taken occasionally, but are not 
as valuable as the exercises under (c). 
IV. Arm exercises. 
Material: E 
Sequent arm exercises with a movement on the first 
of two or four steps and a step on the first, or on the 
first and third movement. 
Forms : 
(a) Flexion and then extension of the arms in the vari- 
ous directions (in like, opp. and unlike) with and 
without turhing them; i. e., four and three move- 
ment sequences. 
(b) Elevation or extension of the arms and then carry- 
ing or swinging them horizontally, vertically or 
obliquely, or flexing them. 
Command: Straighten arms upward—1. Lower 
sideward—-2. Return—3-4. A movement on the 
first of four steps. Or a step on the first (or first 
and third) movement. Repeat, but bend arms on 
three. A step on the first movement. Mazurka 
rhythm. 
V. Two-movement leg and arm exercises combined. 
Material: 
Arm and leg flexion. Arm elevation or flexion and 
elevation of the extended leg, or vice versa.

FREE EXERCISES IN RUNNING. 133 
Examples: 
(a) Marching with raising or swinging knee forward 
(or foot backward) and bending arms to thrust, 
or strike; two counts to each step. 
(b) Raising leg forward and bending arms to thrust, as 
first movement, and stepping and lowering arms 
as second. 
(c) Raising foot in front of opposite knee and raising 
arms fore-upward as first movement, and stepping 
and returning arms as second. 
(d) Marching with raising straight leg forward and 
opposite or both arms fore-upward. 
(e) Marching with raising straight leg forward and 
straightening arms sideward. 
(£) Marching with raising straight leg forward with 
bending opposite knee and raising or straightening 
arms in one of the various directions. 
(g) Same as (f) with raising opposite heel in place of 
bending same knee. 
FREE EXERCISES IN RUNNING. 
These exercises are given at the beginning of the lesson but 
may also be used in the seventh unit. 
The various forms of four-movement arm exercises can be 
used to good advantage in running. The simple forms may be 
taken with a movement on the first of four or two steps and the 
more difficult on the first of eight or four ‘steps. 
Arm positions with leg exercises should also be practiced. 
Running in time with or without obstacles should form the 
first number of every boy’s lesson and should be alternated with 
dance steps in the instruction of the girls. 
Running can be made more interesting by dividing the class 
into smaller divisions which may either run a prescribed course, 
on command, or at will of leader.

STUNTS. 
The Heel and Toe Touch: Jump upward swinging heels back 
vigorously ; while in air touch heels with hands; as soon as feet 
touch floor jump up again swinging knees forward and bending 
body forward touching toes with hands. Alternate heel and toe 
touching as many times as_ possible. : 
Knee Balance Pick-Up: Kneel on one knee and raise the op- 
posite leg backward (arms sideward). Bend forward and pick 
up a handkerchief which is placed on the floor directly in front 
of the knee on which the body weight is resting. A sort of swoop 
downward is necessary to make a reach for the handkerchief. 
The Jumping-Jack: Drop to a full squat-stand, knees well 
apart and the straight arms crossed in front of the body; the 
upper part of the body erect, and the weight resting on toes. 
From this position spring immediately to a stride-stand (knees 
straight) on heels, toes pointing up, and swing arms sideward. 
Repeat several times without losing the balance. 
The Human Log: See Grade IV for description, and add 
lowering the human log. See how many times it can be lifted 
and lowered. 
The Heel Click: Side stride-stand, starting position. Jump 
upward with both feet, clicking heels together twice (or more if 
possible) in the air and return to stride-stand.

  GRADES VII-IX. 
Dumbbells and wands should be frequently used in these 
grades. All of the free exercises given can be readily adapted 
to them. Under certain conditions, as e. g., in cities where not 
much time is allotted to physical education in the grades, it will 
be advisable to select effective exercises from the grades below 
and repeat them with wands and bells. Exercises with the one- 
pound club are given in these grades. 
N. THREE-PART COMBINED EXERCISES 
These consist of two-movement exercises of three parts exe- 
cuted simultaneously. The two-part combined exercises may be 
used as preparatory exercises. 
The three phases of the two-movement arm exercises must 
be considered in the arranging of exercises. 
Material: 
(1) Lunging with arm and head exercises. 
(2) Fall-out with arm exercises. Lay-out 
Toe-stand 2... (upper trunk) and arm 
(3) )Squat-stand § oe [head § exercises.

right—1.° Return—2. 
(b)  Fall-out left forward, swing right arm fore-upward 
and left backward—1. Return—2. (Fig. 32.) 
(c) Lay-out left backward and bend arms to strike—1. 
Return—2. 
Tempo: Polka (double count) and mazurka rhythm.
-P-A-G-E-148

(d) Raise heels, arms sideward and bend upper trunk— 
1. Return—2. 
(e) Raise left leg backward, lower trunk forward -and 
arms sideward—raise. Lower. (Fig. 36.) 
The fall- and lay-out must be developed from the lunge. They are to 
be given in the directions which bring about a trunk lowering forward 
and sideward. They resemble the lunge with the trunk lowered in line 
with the extended leg. Topics 1 and 2 are exercises of a general nature 
and may be given under unit I of a lesson. Topics 3 and 4 consist of 
balance exercises and are to be given under unit III. 
The following exercises of the Third Order (companion ex- 
ercises) may be practiced under their respective units on com- 
mand: 
(a) Lowering trunk backward and forward with 
assistance. 
Formation: Flank couples face to face. 
(1) No. 1: Leg raising forward (foot on partner’s 
knee) with an arm position—1l. Lower and 
raise trunk—2-3, etc. 
No. 2: Lunge forward (fall-out or lay-out back- 
ward) and grasp ankle of No. 1—1. Hold No. 
1 steadily—?2-3, etc. 
Return movement: In position—stand. 
Right. Reverse positions. 
(2) As 1, but in flank rank and raise leg backward. 
Lower trunk forward and raise. 
(3) As 1 and 2, with various arm positions. 
(4) As 1and 2. In the obtained position: Arm exten- 
sion and flexion; arm elevation and lowering. 
(b) ‘Lowering trunk sideward with assistance. 
Formation: Open front couples. 
(1) No. 1: Leg raising sideward (foot on knee of 
partner) with an arm position—1. Lower and 
raise trunk sideward—2-3, etc. 
No. 2: Lunge (fall-out, lay-out) sideward and 
grasp partner’s foot—1. Hold steadily—2-3, etc. 
Return movement: In position—stand. 
(2) As 1, but arm exercises in the obtained position.

  COMPLEX SEQUENCES. 145 
FIFTH. UNIT. ;SPECIAL EXERCISES OF SKILL. 
Fall to squat-stand, hands two or three feet distant. 
Fall to support lying frontways. (Fig. 33.) 
Fall to lying rearways by bending right knee and raising left 
leg forward. 
From support lying frontways, squat to rearways. 
From support lying frontways half turn to rearways, or 
change to lying frontways. Vice versa. 
O. COMPLEX SEQUENCES. 
These consist of four-movement exercises of one part (se- 
quences) combined with two-movement exercises of a second 
and third (intersected) part. They are to be executed in an un- 
limited manner. They may also be arranged as eight-movement 
sequences, e. g.: stride, etc., on 1, lower and raise trunk with 
arm movement from 2 to 7, and return to position on 8. 
Unlimited execution should be frequently applied to the regu- 
lar exercises of the lesson, because of its effectiveness in place 
of four-movement (or limited) execution. The more difficult 
forms may be reserved for the higher grades, particularly those 
of 6 and 8 movements. 
FIRST UNIT. ARM, LEG AND TRUNK EXERCISES. 
Only the valuable exercises, i. e., those in which the lunge, 
foot placing with bending opposite knee, the lay-out and fall-out 
occur, should be selected. As additional material for the first 
unit the two-part sequences (arms and legs) of these grades may 
be substituted. Since the exercises should be general in nature 
the fall- and lay-out with sequent arm exercises should receive 
the preference. If examples of sequent arm with leg and head 
exercises are desired the exercises given under units IV and VI 
may be used as suggestions, substituting head exercises for trunk 
exercises.

Tempo: Mazurka rhythm, triple count and a measure 
to two movements; polka rhythm, double 
count. 
Some forms of exercises with leg movements on 2 and 3 and arm 
movements in opposite and unlike direction to each other should also be 
selected. E. g., Swing arms forward—l. Lay-out left backward, swing 
left arm upward and right opposite—2. Return—3-4. 
SECOND UNIT. UPPER TRUNK BENDING AND 
TRUNK LOWERING. 
These exercises consist of (1) the usual sequent arm exer- 
cises with a definite stand assumed with the first movement of the 
arms, followed by either upper trunk bending or trunk lowering ;~ 
(2) a sequent trunk exercise (turning and then upper trunk 
bending or trunk lowering) performed in an assumed stand and 
arm position ; and (3) a sequent leg exercise with an arm position 
assumed on the first movement and the trunk exercise on 2d and 
3d movement. 
They are to be given in unlimited execution and upon com- 
mand only.

P. TWO-PART SEQUENCES. 
These exercises are composed of sequences of two parts of 
the body. The more difficult forms should be reserved for the 
higher grades. There are some two-part sequences, however, so 
simple, that they can easily be taken up in the lower grades (IV- 
VI). Unlimited and limited execution should be employed. The 
two sequences may be alternated before they are combined.

downward and backward (or left arm upward and 
right upward and fore-downward). 
Tempo: Mazurka, triple count, to polka rhythm, 
e double count. 
The progression of these exercises is based upon the transference of 
weight and upon the relative direction of the four movements of the legs 
and the combined arm and leg movements.

STUNTS. 
The knee touch dip: Stand on the right foot. Grasp the left 
foot behind with the right hand. Bend, touching the left knee to 
the floor and return to a straight stand without touching the floor 
with any other part of the body. 
The heel click: Starting position: Side stride-stand. Jump 
upward with both feet, clicking heels together three times (or 
more if possible) in the air and return to stride stand. 
Squat and extend leg: Squat on_one heel with the other leg 
extended forward. Quickly draw the extended leg under the 
body and shoot the other foot forward, arms raised for balance. 
Shift back and forth rapidly. 
The Cart Wheel: Cart wheel left. Stride left sideward, 
swing arms side-upward and bend trunk right as preliminary posi- 
tion and from here begin the cart wheel by snapping the trunk 
straight and springing on to left and right hand’in succession. 
The legs are extended and apart as they pass through the inverted 
position and are placed, right and then left, on the floor. Close 
by bringing the right foot to the left and lowering arms. 
The hand balance pick-up: Place hands flat on the floor with 
the elbows inside of and firmly pressed against the knees, and 
arms tight against the body. Lean forward slowly and gradually 
placing the weight of the body on the hands and elbows, until 
the feet are raised clear off the floor. Attempt to pick up a hand- 
kerchief from the floor with the teeth and regain the original 
position. 
Instead of attempting to pick up anything, simply rest the 
head on the floor six or eight inches in advance of the hands and ° 
push the feet up into the head-stand. This head-stand comes easy 
to some boys and may be gradually developed. To be repeated ° 
in the senior high school years. 
Jump over foot: Grasp the left foot by the toes with the 
right hand, bending the knee outward as far as possible. Jump 
over the left foot with the right foot without letting go of the 
toes. Try the same backward. See how many forward and back- 
ward jumps you can do.

Dumbbells and wands should be frequently used in these 
grades. The free exercises given can be readily adapted to them. 
For girls’ classes the reed exercises of grades V-VI should be 
continued. The club exercises are also continued. 
COMPLEX SEQUENCES, which are increased by repeating 
one of the simple exercises in the sequences, are mentioned here 
and a few examples given. Occasions may arise for which such 
exercises are desirable.

Q. ALTERNATIONS OF SEQUENCES OF DIS- 
SIMILAR PARTS. 
A sequence of the arms is alternated with one of the legs or 
trunk.. They are given for the purpose of reviewing important 
sequences. Only those of similar rhythm should be alternated. 
The lunge and fall-out from place should be taught in connec- 
tion with these alternations. Singly they are taken forward and 
sideward. As a sequence they are only taken forward.

R. AUGMENTED TWO-PART SEQUENCES. 
This form of exercises consists of a four-movement arm exer- 
cise, a four-movement exercise of a second part, and a two-move- 
ment exercise of a third parts 
These sequences are principally used for the first unit. A 
number of good exercises, in which the arm and leg sequences in- 
crease the effect of the trunk movements, are also contained in 
them. Both limited and unlimited execution should be employed 
as well as exercises from place. Arrangements into eight-move- 
ment sequences in which the two intermediate movements are 
performed from 2 to 7 should be made and given after the two- 
part sequences under “Eight-Movement Sequences.” 
FIRST UNIT. GENERAL EXERCISES. 
I. Toe-stand and arm sequences with simple trunk ex- 
ercises. 
From toe-stand to squat-stand, also foot-placing, bending 
opposite knee (though not so good) with: 
(a) Arm flexion, then extension. © 
(b) Arm elevation, then carrying, swinging or circling. 
(c) Arm extension, then as under (b) ; and a trunk (or 
head) exercise on 2 and 3. 
Examples: 
(a) Raise heels and bend arms to thrust. Bend knee 
half-deep and thrust sideward (or foot-placing, 
: bending opposite knee) and turn head left. 
(b) Raise heels and swing arms fore-upward. Bend 
knees deep and swing arms sideward (or 34 double 
arm circle inward) and turn head left. : 
Tempo: Waltz rhythm. 
II. Leg elevation and arm sequences with simple trunk 
exercises. 
Elevation of the flexed and extended leg, and then foot-plac- 
ing without and with bending opposite knee or layout ; with:

B. SEQUENT TRUNK AND SIMPLE ARM AND LEG 
EXERCISES. 
The arm and leg exercises are executed on 1 and 6 or 8 and 
the four-movement trunk exercise, adapted to the units IV and 
VI, on 2 to 5 or to 7. In unlimited execution the first position 
of the arms and legs may be assumed as a starting position, and 
the fundamental position resumed on command: In position— 
stand. Because of the possibility of changing base (legs) and 
increasing the lever of weight (arm positions) the effect of these 
trunk exercises may be nicely graded.

STUNTS. 
Through Stick: Grasp wand horizontally behind hips with 
palms forward. Bring the wand over the head to a position in 
front of the body, arms straight, without releasing grasp. Lift 
up the right foot, swing it around the right arm and then between 
the hands over the wand from front. Crawl through head first 
and then skin the wand over right knee and back. Step back over 
the wand with the left foot and come to an upright position. At 
the end the wand is in front of the body. 
The Kneeling Reach: Pupil No. 1 kneels down on the ground. 
Pupil No. 2 sits on or holds firmly the heels. of pupil No. 1, who 
then leans forward slowly, and reaches as far forward on the 
ground as it is possible to extend the body and still be able to 
return to original position. This may be used in competition by 
marking with a piece of chalk as far out in front as it is possible 
to reach. 
The Balance Stand Dip and Pick-up: Raise left leg backward 
and arms sideward, and lower trunk forward to a balance stand. 
Then bend and straighten the knee and pick up with the lips a 
handkerchief or other object placed about nine to fifteen inches 
above the floor. 
The Jump Over Leg: Place one foot in the hands of a class- 
mate who holds it about one foot from the floor, and jump over 
it with the other foot by turning toward the held foot. If you 
have done this with each foot, try jumping back over it as well 
as forward. Try placing the foot high on the wall and jumping 
over. Take a run at it. To succeed you must not place any weight 
on the foot which is against the -wall. 
The Hitch Kick: Step forward with the left foot and make 
small kick forward with the right foot, followed by a vigorous 
kick of the left foot while the right” foot is still in the air. The 
right foot strikes the floor a few seconds before the left. An 
object may be placed above the head to indicate the height to be 
kicked.

as advanced work. Furthermore, long sequences containing arm, leg, 
trunk, and springing exercises, such as arg presented in the individual 
competition at the festivals of the American Gymnastic Union may occa- 
sionally be arranged for men. These sequences demand a high degree of 
skill for their execution and should, therefore, be very varied. They are 
performed in the pupil’s own rhythm. 
STUNTS. 
The Hitch Kick: For a description see the stunts given at the 
end of Grades X-XII. Raise the height-mark to be kicked. 
The One-Arm Dip: Place both hands flat on the floor. Slide 
the feet straight back with the body extended and rigid (lying 
support frontways). Remove one hand from floor so that the 
weight rests mostly on one arm. Let the body down by bending 
the arm until it is possible to pick up a handkerchief or other 
object, held between the thumb and fingers of the hand on the 
floor, with the lips, and push back to arm’s length again. 
The Jump Over Wand: Grasp the wand a few inches from 
the ends and jump over it. Then try to jump back again. 
The Deep Dip: Raise the left leg forward. Bend the right 
knee to a full squat, position with left leg extended and arms 
sideward to balance the body. ‘Return to a standing position with- 
out touching any other part of the body to the ground. Try this 
stunt, keeping the heel flat on the floor; also, with the heel up so 
that you will be on the ball of the foot. The balance can be held 
only by bending the upper part of the body forward. 
Bull Neck: Boy No. 1 lies on the ground face downward with 
neck, body and legs rigid. Boy No. 2 clasps his hands under the 
forehead and lifts boy No. 1 to a standing position as though he 
were made of wood. The muscles used in doing this stunt are 
poorly developed in most people. Those in the neck are almost 
entirely so. Very few can do this stunt. Most neck muscles are 
so weak that one finger pressed against the forehead will push it 
backward. 
The Jump Over Hands: Hold the hands with the ends of the 
middle fingers touching and the palms upward in front of the 
body at about the knees and jump forward and backward over the 
hands without pulling the fingers apart. 
Many of the stunts included in this volume are from “Health by 
Stunts,” by Pearl and Brown, published by The Macmillan Company, New 
York City, and are used by permission of and in accordance with arrange- 
ments made with the publishers and authors.

WAND EXERCISES. 
The terminology of the wand exercises will be based upon that 
of the free exercises, that is, whenever possible the movements 
and positions of the arms will be given and the position of the 
wand for the purpose of clearness only. In some instances, which, 
however, are the exceptions, it is necessary to name the position 
of the wand and there are some cases in which both wand and 
arm positions are essential to make the exercise clear. 
One could confine oneself to the exclusive use of terms for 
wand positions and this may be done when the class is thoroughly 
familiar with these positions. The terms used for these positions 
are, however, indefinite and non-descriptive, whereas the defini- 
tions for the arm movements are easily understood. 
There should be a constant pull on the wand in all the 
horizontal positions. 
The theory of the wand exercise is based upon the manner 
in which the wand may be grasped, the position of the arms, 
whether bent or straight, and the position of the wand, whether 
horizontal, vertical or oblique. The following summary explains 
the possibilities when the wand is grasped with upper grip on 
both ends.

under (over) the same and opposite shoulder, may also be per- 
formed in an oblique plane, substituting obliquely fore-downward 
or obliquely fore-upward for the forward position.

214 WAND EXERCISES.   
These exercises consist of combining two of the previously 
stated positions of the wand. In order to understand the many 
possibilities, it is necessary to begin with a definite position in a 
definite plane and then proceed to other definite positions in the 
three planes, thus: 
(a) Bend arms to thrust (1), thrust upward (2), return 
movements (3 and 4), which illustrates a move- 
ment from horizontal to horizontal plane. 
Beginning with the same exercise, all the other positions in the 
horizontal plane would follow, then those in the vertical plane, 
and finally, those in the oblique plane, which would exhaust the 
sequences beginning with arms. bent to thrust. 
The next step would be to begin another exercise in the hor- 
izontal plane and proceed in the same manner until all the exer- 
cises beginning with various positions in the three planes and 
leading to others have been exhausted. 
It is not necessary to give further examples as they may be 
referred to under the wand exercises beginning in Grades V and 
VI. This procedure enables the student to study all of the ma- 
terial from which he may then select the effective and appro- 
priate exercises. 
_ Exercises with Under Grip on Both Ends. 
The wand is grasped with under grip in order to practice 
wand winding. This type of exercise is generally used in se- 
quences and may be grouped as to changes in the same manner 
as the sequences given above in the first group, that is, from 
a position in the horizontal plane, wind wand to a position in the 
horizontal 
vertical plane.

After -the winding has been thoroughly mastered, the first 
movement of a sequence may begin with winding, so that the 
material would distribute itself as follows:

The terminology in winding the wand also indicates the arm e 
rather than the wand. For examples, refer to Grades X—XII. 
Exercises with Mixed Grip with Both Hands. 
This is used principally for striking exercises and. consists. 
of sliding the hand grasping with the under grip, to the upper- 
grip hand. It is termed “close grip left,” when the left hand 
slides to the right. This gives one the same grip that is used 
for batting in baseball. 
The following strike holds are possible: 
(1) Raise arms to strike from head (head strike hold). 
(2) Raise arms to strike from right shoulder (shoulder 
strike hold.) (Fig. 44-B.) 
(3) Raise arms to strike from side of shoulder. 
  
    
Fig. 44—The striking exercise. 
Each of these positions begins with a closed grip of one of 
the hands. From these holds, one may strike with the wand in a 
horizontal (Fig. 44-C), vertical or diagonal plane, depending 
upon the hold. Examples of these exercises begin in Grades VIT 
—IX.
-P-A-G-E-220
  216 WAND EXERCISES. 
Exercises with grip of one hand in the middle, are occasion- 
ally given, to imitate the throwing of a javelin. (Fig. 45.) Ex- 
amples of these exercises are given in grades X—XII. 
  Fig. 45—The javelin throw. 
Companion Exercises with Wands. 
These exercises are performed by two or more individuals 
using one, two or more short or long wands. 
(1) One or two wands grasped by two or more gymnasts. 
(a) Ina front rank with one wand held in front or with 
two wands held in front. 
(b) In the flank rank with one wand held at one side. 
With two wands, one at each side. The individuals - 
may face in the same direction or face each other. 
(c) Various formations, such as the triangle by three 
individuals, the square (and other figures) with 
the individuals at the corners, connected with each 
other by gripping the wand on the end. For these 
exercises the ordinary short wand is used. In the 
same manner, a long wand from 9 to 12 feet in ~ 
length may be used for (a) and (b). The most 
effective way, however, in using the long wand is 
that explained above under (b)—in the flank rank, 
where one wand may be held at one side or two 
wands held, one on each side.

GRADES V-VI. 
The following simple wand exercises are to be arranged with 
appropriate two-movement exercises of other parts as alterna- 
tions, series, intersected, combined, and combined intersected 
exercises (see free exercises) and the wand sequences as aug- 
mented sequences. For material refer to the groups named under 
free exercises. 
Their principal use should be to increase the effect of trunk 
movements, hence wand and leg positions should be combined 
with this in view. 
The vertical positions are better adapted to lateral than to 
antero-posterior trunk movements, while the horizontal positions 
are suitable for both kinds of trunk movements. 
The oblique positions are seldom used, with a few exceptions, 
for wand exercises in general, but are given in grades VII-IX 
to give the student a knowledge of these positions. In fact, it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  
220 WAND EXERCISES. 
well to limit one’s self to the use of a few practical and effective 
positions and sequences in the adaption of wand exercises to the 
various classes. 
The wand, which is made of wood for these grades and is one 
inch in diameter and about thirty-two to thirty-six inches long, 
is carried vertically on the forefinger of the right hand with 
thumb in front, and pressed firmly against the right shoulder. 
Starting position: 
(1) Wand horizontal in front of thighs. Lower wand 
horizontally in front of thighs in two counts—1, 
2. Swing the arm side-upward and grasp the 
wand near the end with the palm turned forward 
on 1. Bring it in front of thighs on 2 with the 
right hand taking the same grip as the left. 
(2) Wand vertical in right hand. Raise wand verti- 
cally in right hand—t, 2. 
The wand is placed on the floor in the following manner: 
From wand vertical in right hand, raise left hand front of right 
shoulder and grasp wand —1. Right—%. Lower hands and place 
wand (end) on floor—3; or lower both hands with grip on wand 
to side of right thigh on 3, and place end of wand on floor and 
left hand to left side, retaining grip on wand with right hand, 
on 4. The wand is held against the side of the, leg with the right 
hand. Return in reverse order. Commanded briefly: place 
wand on floor 1-2-3; carry wand 1-2-3. Any other position of 
the wand may also be used as starting position.

These exercises begin from a mixed grip, the left hand grasping 
under and the right grasping upper grip on the end. The exercises may, 
however, start from upper grip of both hands and the left hand change 
grip as the wand is raised instead of assuming a starting position with 
mixed grip, and return to upper grip as it is lowered. The command 
may also be abbreviated to “bend arms to strike from,’ omitting the words 
“close grip left and” after the class is thoroughly familiar with the execu- 
tion. These sequences are to be combined with such two-movement 
exercises as naturally occur in striking (batting). Progress from the 
augmented to the complex and two-part sequences. Tempo: polka rhythm, _ 
double count for the wand exercises: See free exercise tempo for com- 
binations.

G. WAND SWINGS. 
The iron wand, weighing from three to five pounds and of the 
same length, or a trifle longer than the wooden wand (36 inches) 
should be taken up in these grades with the boys’ work. 
The following wand sequences are to be repeated in these 
grades as wand swings. The swinging movement should be made 
as large as possible when passing from one position to another. 
The swings should furthermore be fluent and pass smoothly from 
position to position. The examples given are only suggestions. 
It is not difficult to arrange other effective swings. They are to 
be arranged as augmented, complex, two-part, and augmented 
two-part sequences. These sequences should also be reviewed 
without swings occasionally.

ADVANCED WORK. 
The wand exercises of the previous grades may be arranged 
as eight-movement sequences using the various changes. of wand 
positions given there. A five-pound wand, from thirty-six to 
forty-two inches long, should be used in men’s work. 
“Wand Swings” should predominate in these sequences. 
The “Wand Winding’ given may be repeated and the follow- 
ing variations added: 
(1) Wind on 1 and 3 and unwind on 2 and 4. Example: 
Wind left backward—1. Unwind and swing arms 
upward—2. Return—3-4. Also, wind right on 3. 
(2) Wind on 1, unwind and re-wind on 2 and 3, unwind 
on 4, Example: Wind left sideward—1. Un- 
wind and wind right sideward—2. Return—3-s.. 
(3) Wind and circle wand into different positions by re- 
leasing grip of hand which did not wind. 
Examples: 
(a) Wind left sideward—1. Release right, 1/1 wand 
circle left, regrasp right and raise arms forward— 
2. Return—3-4. 
(b) As (a), but to strike from right shoulder on 2. Sup- 
port-lying by support of wand should also be prac- 
ticed. Bend knees, wand vertical, on floor—t. 
Jump to support-lying—2. The wand is grasped 
in the center with one hand as it is placed on the 
floor; or both hands mixed grip.

  CLUB EXERCISES. 
The terminology of club exercises will be based upon that of 
the free exercises, that is, with few exceptions, the arm move- 
ment will be named. These exceptions refer principally to posi- 
tions in which the clubs are crossed or in which they are held in 
definite relation to some part of the body, as crossing clubs over 
head or placing one club over head and one in front of hips. 
Simple exercises with clubs. In these exercises, the clubs may 
be held either in line with the arm or at right angles to it. There 
are a number of movements which lead to Club Positions, which 
are frequently used. Examples will be found in Grades VII—IX. 
Club swinging is divided into the following possibilities : 
fa. sideward, in front and 
(1.) Pendulum Swings | rear of body; 
of one or both arms b. forward and backward ; 
[c. diagonally. 
These are used as preliminary exercises for the circles and are 
combined with different parts of the body. See Grades VII—IX 
for examples. 
(2) Part and Whole Arm Circles. 
All arm circling is done in three vertical planes; the lateral, 
which consists of arm circles inward, outward and sideward, left 
and right, (see page 22 of the terminology) ; in antero-posterior 
circles, which consist of forward and backward circles on the 
left and right side of the body, and circles in the diagonal plane, 
which consists of circles obliquely left and right, forward or 
backward. 
All exercises are progressively given left, right, alternately and 
simultaneously. The most common degrees used in circling are 
180° or ¥% circles; 225° or 5% circles; 270° or 34 circles, and 
360° or whole circles or more. (See Fig. 15., p. 22.) In the ter- 
minology, the fractions are used to indicate the degree of circling 
desired. Continuous circles to a definite number of counts are 
very frequently used in exercises. Refer to pages 242 and 243 
for examples of arm circling.
-P-A-G-E-241
  
INTRODUCTION. 237 
(3) Tipping or tilting clubs. 
Tipping of clubs is adapted to arm circles and is usually per- 
formed in the sideward, forward or oblique position of the arms, 
but may also occur in the upward position, in an exercise. It 
consists of dropping the club on the forearm and develops skill 
in handling the club, preparing to some extent for the hand circles. 
(4) Forearm Circles. 
The forearm circles are swung in the same planes and in the 
same directions as the arm circles. They are worked into com- 
binations with the arm circling and the tipping of the clubs. For 
examples of these, see page 245. 
(5) Hand Circles. 
The hand circles are swung in three vertical planes, similar to 
those of the arm circles, but in addition, may be performed in 
relation to different parts of the body. They are furthermore 
swung in the horizontal plane, a plane in which arm circles are 
seldom used. 
Hand circles in (upward arms

(c) Diagonal plane—as. antero-posterior. 
(d) In horizontal (outward, inward, |above and below arm

Hand circles may furthermore be executed as follows: The 
left (right) hand circles over right shoulder, under arm, double 
hand (left and right) circle over one shoulder or rear of one hip. 
Two hand circles in rapid succession, performing them in one 
count as front and rear of shoulder. See pages 246 and 247. 
(6) Combinations. 
The hand circles are most frequently added to arm circles in 
combination, but all of the foregoing suggested groups may be 
combined into exercises consisting of arm circles without and 
with tipping clubs, forearm circles and hand circles. (b) Antero-posterior 
plane 1

238 CLUB EXERCISES. 
(7) Peculiar Swings and Circles. 
There are a number of swings and circles which cannot be 
classified in the above, but which are often used in the more 
advanced work. They consist of (1) arm and hand circles as 
follow circles in three vertical planes, similar to the arm circles. 
(2) They may also be formed in a horizontal plane as follow 
circles over and under the forward arms and over the head (one 
hand following the other). 
Changing from one vertical plane to another gives rise to the 
figure eight swings. They consist of the following: 
ae in front of and at 
3 a backward )side of body 
pero st is Jat side (left and right) 
[sideward of body 
These movements do not consist always of large arm circles, 
but are of necessity reduced, particularly during some of the 
swings at side of body to small arm circles or even forearm circles. 
The circles are in last analysis follow circles and belong to the pre- 
ceding group, it is only the changing from one plane to another 
that gives them the appearance of the figure eight and thus makes 
them distinctly different. When these large and small arm circles 
are reduced, they lead to the hand circles, all of which are per- 
formed in exactly the same plane, and which, as can be easily 
noticed, are the same as the hand circles given under “Follow 
Circles.” 
(8) The Snake Circles. 
The snake circles are a form of hand circles which make use 
of tipping the club and winding it about the forearm. They are 
performed outward and inward, single and double, and as follow 
circles. 
There are many combinations possible, not at all indicated in 
this outline of a system of club swinging. The most important 
ones have been worked out and examples given in this text but 
unlimited possibilities are yet inherent in the material given which 
the instructor can readily work out for himself. The examples 
presented are intended as a foundation for club swinging and 
can be improved upon readily.
-P-A-G-E-243
  
GRADES VII—IX. 239 
GRADES VII-IX. 
The one-pound club is heavy enough for these grades. For 
the higher grades and for advanced classes a one and one-half 
to two-pound (men) club may be used. Only fundamental 
swings and circles are given in this outline. Attention, however, 
is called to the more intricate swings which are practiced to im- 
prove the students’ proficiency. For physical educational pur- 
poses these have little value, but to some extent, may be taught 
to arouse interest in the work. 
In the arrangement of lessons a series of swings are to be 
followed by movements of other parts of the body during which 
the clubs may be placed on the floor. Thus the swings may be 
given as unit I and V and with certain simple combinations 
under units [V and VI and placed on the floor at other times. 
In advanced classes, particularly in men’s and women’s 
classes, this need not be followed. The abbreviations D. A. C. 
for double arm circle and D. H. C. for double hand circle, are 
frequently used. 
Tempo: Waltz rhythm is most suitable 
for swings: It should be a fairly fast rhythm 
so that the swings will be performed in a lively 
manner. When large movements of other 
parts of the body are added this rhythm must 
be somewhat retarded. A few exercises are 
performed best in polka rhythm, such as 
straightening and striking. The execution of 
arm and other circles in polka rhythm is not, 
however, to be recommended because of the 
sharp emphasis occuring in this rhythm. The 
smooth flowing waltz rhythm is most suitable, 
because of these qualities, for circles. 
_ Fig. 46—The start- Clubs to starting position—raise. (Fig. ing position. 
- 46.) Lower. 
Starting position: Clubs are raised with the arms bent to 
thrust; hands close to and near the side of the shoulders; the 
fore-arms and clubs are in a vertical position and in one line; 
the knob of the club is at the base of the hand and the palms are 
turned toward the shoulders. The fundamental position is also 
used as starting position.

EXERCISES WITH RINGS. 
A small wooden ring about nine inches in diameter is used. 
The ring is held in both hands in a horizontal or wertical position, 
with and without winding it or in one hand and then combined 
with other exercises. The ring may also be used to connect two 
or more individuals as couples, the individuals facing each other, 
or small circles of three or more with individuals facing inward 
or outward. The ring, like the bounding ball, is of insignificant 
value and is gradually disappearing from use. 
EXAMPLES OF FREE EXERCISES WITH RINGS. 
Starting position: Fundamental position with ring in right 
hand. 
(1) Raise arms forward and grasp ring (ring vertical)—1. 
Wind arms inward and forward—2. Return—3-4. 
With turning trunk; with bending trunk backw.; with 
bending trunk forw..on 2. 
(2) Raise arms side-upw. and grasp ring (ring horizontal )— 
1. Wind arms inw. and forw.—2. Return—3-4. 
- (a) With placing foot forw. on 1; placing backw. with 
bending right knee on 2. 
(b) With placing foot sideward on 1; back-inward, bend- 
ing right knee—2. 
(c) With placing foot sidew. on 1; lunging forw. on 2. 
In couples grasping each other’s ring: Facing in 
same direction; also facing each other in flank for- 
mation. 
(3) Both raise arms sideward—1. No.1: Bend knees deep 
with raising arms upward; No: 2: Rise on toes with 
moving arms forward—2. Return—3-4. Also kneel- 
ing. Adapt this to the two formations. 
(4) Arms sideward with placing foot sideward (opp. foot)— 
1. Lunge sideward (away from each other) with mov- 
ing outer arm over head (small lunge)—2. Return 
—3-4, 
Also exercises in which both execute the same exercise, 
as rising on toes, bending knees with arm exercises, etc. 
In small citcle formation. Rings grasped.
-P-A-G-E-265
EXERCISES WITH FLAGS. 261 
(5) Place foot forward with arms forward (also stride)—1. 
Bend trunk backward with arms upward—2. 
(6) Same, but No. 1 kneels on 2 (No. 2 moves arms sidew.). 
(7)° As (5), but place foot backward and bend trunk forward 
on 2. Same in front ranks of four or more. Exercises 
in divided order.   
EXERCISES WITH FLAGS. 
Flags are very frequently used in connection with free exer- 
cises, particularly for exhibition purposes. They add no value 
to the work and are only used to improve appearance of exercises. 
The flag is usually carried like a wand (ordinary small flags are 
used) and is either held vertical or horizontal in the different arm 
positions. Some apparatus manufacturers make a rather heavy 
flag for this purpose so that they can be used as clubs and swung 
in all kinds of circles. 
EXERCISES WITH A BOUNDING BALL. 
The bounding ball is sometimes used in drills. Dance steps 
are combined with throwing and catching the ball in various ways. 
The following possibilities suggest themselves: 
(a) Throwing and catching from one hand to the same 
hand, and the other hand. 
(b) Throwing from one hand and catching in both hands. 
(c) Throwing with both hands and catching with one. 
(d) Bounding the ball by throwing over the arm or the 
raised leg and catching as above. 
(e) Throwing ball upward under the arm and catching 
as. above. 
All of this may be combined with free exercise posi- 
tions and dance steps. ;

  THE ROCKEFELLER, FOUNDATION 
FINANCIAL RESOURCES 
The income of The Rockefeller Foundation 
would pay the current expenses of the United 
States Government for only seven hours; if the 
principal were used this would be exhausted in 
- five days. The public functions of the city of 
New York could be supported for 12 days out 
of income, and for six months and 26 days out 
of endowment. At the present rate of ex- 
penditure the American Red Cross would con- 
sume the total income of the Foundation in 17 
days, and the principal in less than ten months. 
It has been estimated that $207,000,000 are dis- 
bursed annually for private charity in the United 
States. If The Rockefeller Foundation were 
called upon to assume this burden its income 
would carry the budget for twelve and one-half 
days; its invested funds for about seven months. 
In the light of these facts it is obvious that 
the resources of the Foundation, measured by 
the needs of governments and large social under- 
takings, are relatively limited. Widely dis- 
bursed in aid of a large number of existing 
agencies, the income would have little appre- 
19
-P-A-G-E-22
  20 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
ciable effect; it might even chiefly replace rather 
than supplement gifts from other sources. Only . 
by concentrating its funds upon a few convincing 
demonstrations and statesmanlike programs can 
the Foundation justify its existence, and con- 
structively ‘“‘promote the well-being of mankind 
throughout the world.” 
While it is true that the Foundation’s income 
could not pay any appreciable share of society’s 
bill for administration and charity, it is also a 
fact that for purposes of experiment, of demon- 
stration, and of fostering comprehensive pro- 
jects, the institution has substantial resources. 
On December 31, 1917, the principal. fund of 
the Foundation had a book value of $120,765,- 
865 and a market value of about $105,000,000. 
The income of this fund for the year 1917 was 
$7,153,852. To this were added a balance car- 
ried over from 1916, a gift by Mr. John D. 
Rockefeller of $5,500,000, and the sum of $5,000,- 
000 taken by vote of the Trustees from the 
principal fund. 
The Founder’s relinquishment in July of the 
right he had reserved in his deed of gift to con- 
trol the annual expenditure of $2,000,000 of 
income for purposes consistent with the charter, 
did not add to the total income of the Founda- 
tion. It did, however, including reserve from 
former years, increase by nearly $2,000,000 the
-P-A-G-E-23
  INROADS UPON PRINCIPAL 21 
sum at the complete disposal of the Board in 
1917. In 1918, the entire income will be avail- 
able for unrestricted use. 
INROADS UPON PRINCIPAL 
Table I on page 22, showing receipts, dis- 
bursements, and obligations in 1917, presents in 
summary form the Foundation’s current re- 
sources and the different purposes to which these 
are being devoted. In order to understand this 
budget one must distinguish between “appro- 
priations” and “‘disbursements.”” For example, 
in May, 1917, the Foundation appropriated 
$5,000,000 to the American Red Cross, and 
agreed to pay this sum in ten monthly instal- 
ments of a half million dollars each. Seven 
such payments, a total of $3,500,000, were in- 
cluded in the disbursements of 1917; the re- 
maining $1,500,000 will appear in the budget of 
1918. 
The cash balance carried forward into the 
year 1918, $11,629,048, seems at first glance to 
be a large sum. It will be noted, however, that 
all but $1,271,338 of this amount will be needed 
to meet appropriations and pledges for the next 
fiscal year. If the Foundation were to con- 
tinue during 1918 to support. war work at the 
present level of appropriation, almost the total

SUPERVISION OF POLICY BY THE TRUSTEES 23 
income from investments accruing in that year 
' would be required for this purpose alone. This 
means that unless gifts for war activities are 
sharply reduced, the year 1919 will see a demand 
for further inroads upon the principal fund. 
Only the large gift by the Founder, his relin- 
quishment of the right of designation, and the 
appropriation of $5,000,000 of principal by the 
Trustees enabled the Foundation to disburse 
and pledge so extraordinary a total in 1917. 
SUPERVISION OF POLICY BY THE TRUSTEES 
During the year the stated meetings of the 
Board were so rearranged as to fall early in 
December, late in February, and at the end of 
May. At the meeting on December 5, 1917, the 
officers presented, in a docket which was sent to 
members a week in advance, a review of the ap- 
propriations made since the Foundation was 
chartered, budget estimates for the year 1918, 
a forecast of income and expenditures up to 
1922, an outline of policies, and a general pro- 
gram for the immediate future. After full dis- 
cussion, the Trustees approved a budget and 
sanctioned certain lines of procedure. At the 
same meeting officers were elected and salaries 
were fixed by the Board as a whole. Thus the 
Trustees participated in a careful review of the
-P-A-G-E-26
24 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION. 
Foundation’s activities and in formulating plans 
for the coming year. Twice during the year the 
Trustees were invited to sit with the Executive 
Committee to consider large appropriations— 
one to the American Red Cross and one to the 
Young Men’s Christian Association. These 
meetings were in effect special meetings of the 
entire Board. The Executive Committee by 
sending its minutes to the Trustees keeps them 
constantly informed of the steps by which their 
policies are being carried out. 
FREEDOM OF ACTION AND LIMITATIONS 
Government activities are, for the most part, 
necessarily and properly deliberate; they are 
limited by legal and administrative restrictions. 
A Foundation has, within the provisions of its 
charter; relatively a free hand. Only such an 
institution could, for instance, select the world’s 
leading authority on a certain disease, provide 
a staff and all necessary funds, and send him to 
foreign countries in order to eradicate from the 
world one of the deadliest of infectious maladies. 
It would be a mistake, therefore, for The Rocke- 
feller Foundation to hamper itself by adopting 
inflexible rules, or to tie its own hands with red 
tape. 
Yet there are things which it cannot success-
-P-A-G-E-27
THE PRESENT PROGRAM 25 
fully or wisely do; such as, for example, give 
money or make loans to individuals, or invest in 
securities which have a philanthropic rather 
than a business basis, or assist in securing pat- 
ents, or aid altruistic movements which involve 
private profit. It must also refrain from sup- 
porting propaganda which seek to influence 
public opinion about the social order and polit- 
ical proposals, however disinterested and impor- 
tant these may be. Thus, appeals to finance 
in whole or in part a speakers’ bureau in behalf 
of the war, the teaching of patriotism in the 
public schools, and an advertising campaign 
for national prohibition have been denied on 
principle. 
THE PRESENT PROGRAM 
Demonstrations such as those which are being 
made at home and abroad in the field of public 
health, well-organized cooperative undertak- 
ings, like the camp and community plan for the 
welfare of American soldiers, a comprehensive 
program of inquiry of the sort which the Na- 
tional Committee for Mental Hygiene is carry- 
ing out, represent characteristic Foundation 
policies. The aim always kept in mind is not to 
assume governmental or social functions, but 
to show that certain things can be done success-
-P-A-G-E-28
26 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
fully, and then as soon as may be to turn these 
over to the community. 
The “well-being of mankind throughout the 
world” so obviously depends upon the winning 
of the war by the forces of freedom, that the 
Foundation is devoting by far the largest part 
of its available resources to the support of war 
work. At the same time, activities which are 
improving public health:and thus contributing 
to human progress are being maintained in many 
parts of the world. The several projects which 
are described in the pages which follow are all’ 
parts of a program which aims at helping to win 
the war, and at making a better world after the 
war. 
WORKING WITH THE RED CROSS AND THE 
CAMP COMMISSIONS 
With the entrance of the United States into 
the war, The Rockefeller Foundation decided to 
withdraw its War Relief Commission from 
Europe and to put a large sum at the disposal 
of the American Red Cross, which, reorganized 
under a War Council, has undertaken compre- 
hensive programs of ‘relief, both to the allied 
armies and to the civilian populations of the 
war-stricken countries. Negotiations were also 
opened with this organization with a view to its
-P-A-G-E-29
RED CROSS AND CAMP COMMISSIONS Q7 
assuming responsibility for the care of the 500 
Belgian children whom the Foundation had been 
maintaining in Switzerland since 1915. This 
policy of consolidation has been followed be- 
cause, in the opinion of the Trustees, it is unwise 
to multiply independent and often overlapping 
agencies of war relief. The times call for unified, 
well-organized effort in this field. The only 
work which the Foundation is directly adminis- 
tering in Europe is an antituberculosis cam- 
paign directed by the Foundation’s Interna- 
tional Health Board, and intimately related to 
the American Red Cross’s relief and health 
activities in France. 
The Government has from the outset insisted 
that the training camps—especially those of the 
National (draft) Army—are not to be thought of 
as necessary evils to be mitigated, but as posi- 
tive educational institutions of immense poten- 
tial value. Whereas in the past the worst ele- 
ments of communities have been mobilized to 
exploit and to debauch the soldier and sailor, 
today the best forces are combining to protect 
and benefit them. 
The cooperation of official commissions and 
of national and local societies in providing—both 
within and without the camps—comfort, recrea- 
tion, social entertainment, educational oppor- 
tunity, moral safeguards, and idealistic influences
-P-A-G-E-30
28 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
for the American forces, offers a striking example 
of genuine team-work. To nearly all of the 
units that make up this vast cooperation, The 
Rockefeller Foundation has given sums which 
aggregate approximately $4,800,000, or about 
eight per cent. of the total budget for the entire 
undertaking. Table 2 on page 29 enumerates 
the different organizations, together with the 
war budget of each, and the amount appro- 
priated to it by the Foundation. 
,MENTAL DISEASES IN WAR AND IN PEACE 
The present war has shown strikingly that 
mental and nervous diseases play a prominent 
part in military medicine. The term “shell 
shock” has been hit upon to describe a wide 
range of cases from simple cowardice to true 
paralysis. To diagnose accurately and to treat 
successfully these nervous disorders has become 
a pressing need. During the months of May 
and June, 1917, Dr. Thomas W. Salmon, a 
recognized authority in this field, visited the 
British Isles, at the expense of The Rockefeller 
Foundation, and there made a study of the 
nature and treatment of nervous diseases in 
military hospitals. His report has been of value 
to the Surgeon General’s office in formulating 
an army policy for the treatment -and hospital

care of nervous cases, and also in devising a plan 
for examining volunteers and drafted men in 
order to exclude persons who are mentally or 
nervously unfit for military service. 
In helping the Surgeon General to recruit the 
specialists needed for this work, in providing 
quickly supplies and expense funds which the 
Government either could not furnish at all or 
only after long delays, the National Committee 
for Mental Hygiene rendered during 1917 prompt 
and expert aid. Funds for these purposes are 
being furnished by The Rockefeller Foundation. 
Dr. Salmon, commissioned as a major in the 
Medical Officers Reserve Corps, has been sent to 
France to assume charge of that branch of the 
army medical service which has been entrusted 
with the care of “shell shock’’ and other nervous 
casualties. 
During 1917 the Foundation has continued 
to support the program of the National Com- 
mittee for Mental Hygiene in making surveys 
of methods of public care for the insane and the 
feeble-minded, and in carrying out demonstra- 
tion studies of abnormalities in a given com- 
munity and of the mental characteristics of 
criminals. The care of the insane and the 
feeble-minded varies widely in the different 
States of the Union. It lags, on the average, 
far behind the progress made in the treatment
-P-A-G-E-33
MENTAL DISEASES IN WAR AND IN PEACE 31 
of other forms of disease. The public attitude 
toward mental maladies is still affected by 
superstition and ignorance. The persons in 
charge of State and county institutions and the 
attendants are too often conventionally minded, 
frequently untrained, occasionally indifferent, 
and at times even brutal. While many are 
good, too often State hospitals are either wholly 
lacking or are quite unequal to their responsi- 
bilities. 
Since 1915, surveys of conditions have been 
made and recommendations formulated in 12 
States. In a number of instances the results 
were prompt and striking. For example, in one 
State, a month after the report of a survey 
made at the Governor’s request appeared, the 
legislature appropriated a half-million dollars 
for rehabilitating and modernizing in manage- 
ment the State Hospital for the Insane. In 
another State, during 1917, on the basis of a 
plan formulated by Dr. Salmon, $600,000 was 
granted for a similar purpose. 
The first report of the Psychiatric Clinic at 
Sing Sing Prison has appeared recently. This 
includes studies, supervised by the National 
Committee for Mental Hygiene, of the personal 
histories and mental and moral characteristics 
of 600 persons successively admitted to the in- 
stitution during a period in 1916-1917. These 
3
-P-A-G-E-34
82 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
records indicate that a large percentage of crimi- 
nals are mentally abnormal and point to the 
conclusion that the system for dealing with con- 
victed persons ought to be modified. The re- 
sults of this study have had an influence upon 
the formulation of new plans for institutional 
organization in New York State. 
In connection with a children’s court in a 
large city, studies have been made of mental 
traits, moral qualities, and environmental in- 
fluences. It is believed that the results of these 
investigations will throw light upon the problem 
of juvenile delinquency and suggest better meth- 
ods of dealing with it. 
CARING FOR VICTIMS OF INFANTILE 
PARALYSIS 
To the after care of the New York children 
who in the epidemic of 1916 were victims of 
infantile paralysis, the Foundation has made con- 
tributions through a special committee for New 
York City and through the State Charities Aid 
Association. A large number of children have 
been supplied with braces, the use of which in 
most cases is only temporarily necessary. By 
systematic massage and special exercises gratify- 
ing results have been secured; hundreds have 
been wholly restored or are on the way to com-
-P-A-G-E-35
CARING FOR INFANTILE PARALYSIS VICTIMS 33 
plete recovery, while in the case of many others, 
disabilities are being minimized. Plans have 
been made to continue the clinics and home 
treatments which have proved so successful. 
Not only have hundreds of children been 
cured or greatly improved by this after care, but 
important knowledge has been acquired which 
will prove of great value in dealing with the 
problems of infantile paralysis in the future. 
An important by-product of the after care work 
in New York City has been the cooperation of 
various outpatient agencies which, under the 
guidance of a central committee with funds at 
its disposal, have developed common standards 
and methods of treatment. It would be an 
excellent thing for the city if this plan were ex- 
tended to include the standardizing of all the 
services in which the dispensaries of Greater 
New York are engaged. 
THE TRAINING OF SANITARIANS 
Impressed by the need of fostering research 
in the field of preventive medicine and of pro- 
viding thorough training for public health offi- 
cers, laboratory personnel, field workers, nurses, 
and inspectors, The Rockefeller Foundation, 
in 1915, offered to bear the cost of establishing 
and maintaining, as a part of Johns Hopkins
-P-A-G-E-36
34 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
University, a School of Hygiene and Public 
Health. During the academic year 1917-18 a 
notable faculty is being recruited, policies are 
being determined, and plans for a special labora- 
tory and administration building are being pre- 
pared. Dr. William H. Welch resigned his pro- 
fessorship in the Johns Hopkins Medical School 
to become director of the new school. 
While this institution will necessarily main- 
tain close relations with the Medical School, it 
will not be subordinate ‘to that division of the 
University. The School of Hygiene and Pub- 
lic Health will have its own quarters, its own 
faculty, its own problems and purposes, its own 
distinct body of students, and will develop from 
the outset a corporate individuality and a pro- 
fessional spirit. ; 
The preliminary bulletin of the new school 
announces the conditions of admission and the 
courses of instruction which will go into effect 
with the opening of the institution in October, 
1918. The terms of admission are most liberal; 
at the same time the requirements for degrees 
set a high standard. Not only will regular full- 
time students be provided for, but arrangements 
will be made by which health officers in active 
service may resort to the school for short, in- 
tensive courses. The departments so far or- 
ganized are: Bacteriology and Immunology, 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
THE TRAINING OF SANITARIANS 35 
Dr. William H. Welch; Physiology, Dr. William H. 
Howell; Chemistry, Dr. E. V. McCollum; Biom- 
etry and Vital Statistics, Dr. Raymond Pearl. 
Instruction in Sanitary Engineering will be or- 
ganized by Professor Charles J. Tilden, and 
lectures on Sanitary and Administrative Law 
will be given by President Frank J. Goodnow. 
For quarters during the first year, a recently 
vacated University building is being renovated 
and equipped. It is hoped that the new labora- 
tory will be ready for occupancy soon after the 
end of the war. While the School properly begins 
its work conservatively and unpretentiously, 
there is reason to expect that it will gradually 
win recognition as a national—even an interna- 
tional—center of research and teaching, and thus 
come to play a leading part in the fields of pre- 
ventive medicine and public health administra- 
tion which are today being so rapidly extended. 
PUBLIC HEALTH WORK IN MANY LANDS 
It was chiefly the experience of the Interna- 
tional Health Board of The Rockefeller Founda- 
tion, in health work at home and abroad, that 
called attention to the need of a school such as 
has been established in Baltimore. This Board 
has developed definite aims, constructive poli- 
cies, and consistent programs. The Tuber-
-P-A-G-E-38
36 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
culosis Commission in France was properly put 
in charge of ‘this agency of the Foundation. 
The appended report of the General Director, 
Wickliffe Rose, shows that during 1917 steady 
progress has been made by the International 
Health Board in conducting its warfare against 
hookworm disease, malaria, and yellow fever; 
in promoting public health administration; in 
securing the passage of better sanitary laws; in 
persuading governments to increase their ex- 
penditures for preventive medicine; in encour- 
aging public health education; in gathering in- 
formation concerning medical education in South 
America, and in increasing knowledge about the 
effective treatment of certain infectious diseases. 
Work for the control of hookworm disease 
was extended during the year 1917 to three of the 
States in Brazil, to Siam, the Fiji Islands, Sey- 
chelles Islands, and to four additional States of 
the Union—Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, and 
Maryland. In one country, Antigua, the work 
which had been undertaken in 1915 was com- 
pleted. The Board was at work during the year 
in 87 areas, which included 12° American States 
and 25 foreign states and countries. Late in the 
year 1917, the International Health Board began 
in the Pinghsiang Colliery in Kiangsi Province, 
China, its first attempt to deal with hookworm 
control in mines. The moisture and high tem-

peratures in underground workings offer favor- 
-able conditions for the development of the eggs. 
HELPING GOVERNMENTS TO ASSUME 
RESPONSIBILITIES 
Only a study of the report of the General 
Director of the International Health Board 
can make one fully realize the detail and the 
value of the work which is being carried on by 
its staff of 556 persons scattered over the world. 
It is gratifying to note, therefore, that govern- 
ments everywhere are showing willingness to 
assume an increasing share of the expense in- 
volved. Such response is a real test, for unless 
governments are prepared to assume respon- 
sibility for controlling hookworm and other 
infectious diseases, the service of a private 
foundation can at best be palliative, ephemeral, 
and in the end futile. 
Governments, stimulated by the facts brought 
to light by the International Health Board, are 
enacting sanitary laws. For example, 20,000 
latrines—essential to preserve the soil from the 
pollution which spreads hookworm infection— 
have been recently erected under legal compul- 
sion in the villages of Kalutara Province in Cey- 
lon. Greatly improved sanitary laws and ad- 
ministrative codes have been adopted in the 
West Indies, in Seychelles Islands, and in Guate- 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
38 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
mala. In certain countries individual planters 
and large estates are cooperating with the Board 
by bearing all or a large part of the expense. 
A WORLD-WIDE RESEARCH STAFF 
The staff of the International Health Board 
constitutes a unique agency for cooperative 
research. Scores of specialists assigned to sta- 
tions in many parts of the world are under the 
direction of a single administration, and may be 
quickly instructed to test under a wide variety 
of conditions a new discovery or a promising 
theory. For example, the Board’s Commission 
to the Orient, which returned in August, 1917, 
from a visit to the Malay States, Java, and Fiji, 
reported that methods of hookworm control 
could be improved. If, after additional experi- 
ments, these new methods continue to prove 
promising, they will be submitted to the whole 
staff for testing and further report. The Com- 
mission to the Orient also made studies of the 
mental, physical, economic, and social effects of 
hookworm disease upon an infected population. 
BEGINNING A CAMPAIGN AGAINST MALARIA 
In the fight against hookworm disease, the staff 
of the International Health Board has come fre- 
quently in contact with malaria. This malady is  
-P-A-G-E-41
  CAMPAIGN AGAINST MALARIA 39 
prevalent not only in the Orient but also’ in 
certain American areas, particularly in the 
Southern States. The depressing effects of the 
disease on bodily and mental vigor, on personal 
happiness and community spirit, are well known. 
The detailed reports of demonstrations which 
have been conducted in communities in Arkansas 
and Mississippi disclose a quick response to the 
methods employed, reveal the fact of low per 
capita costs, and show in how short a time towns 
and villages can be convinced that it pays to ap- 
propriate funds for public health purposes. 
COOPERATION WITH SOUTH AMERICAN 
INSTITUTIONS 
The real aim of the International Health 
Board is not merely to specialize in two or three 
infectious diseases, but by concrete demonstra- 
tions in the control of these maladies, to fix atten- 
tion upon problems of public health and to in- 
duce governments to give more attention to this 
fundamental need. The Board inevitably be- 
comes interested in the training of public health 
officials and in medical education in foreign 
countries. It has recently, for instance, shown 
such an interest in South American progress. 
Dr. R. M. Pearce, in behalf of the Board, made 
an investigation into medical education and 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
40 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
public health activities in Brazil, Argentina, and 
Uruguay. As a result, the International Health 
Board has agreed to assist the University of Sao 
Paulo (Brazil) in establishing a Department of 
Hygiene. This will be directed for five years 
by an American professor. At the end of this 
period he will be succeeded by a Brazilian, who 
will meantime have been trained in the United 
States. Two fellowships have also been pro- 
vided for bringing promising Sao Paulo physi- 
cians to this country for training in public health. 
In similar fashion a department of pathology 
is being created in the Bello Horizonte Medical 
School. A fellowship has been granted for the 
training in the United States of a Brazilian 
pathologist who will in due time assume charge 
of this new department. These initial attempts 
to establish relations with foreign medical cen- 
ters, and to encourage student migration and 
exchange professorships, are full of significance 
for the future. 
PLANS TO ERADICATE YELLOW FEVER 
But for the war, Surgeon General Gorgas 
and his colleagues would have sailed in the 
early summer of 1917 for South America to begin 
a campaign for ridding the world of yellow fever. 
In 1916 he had headed a commission of the Inter-
-P-A-G-E-43
CAMPAIGN AGAINST YELLOW FEVER 41 
national Health Board to South America and 
had delimited the seed-beds of the disease. 
The sources of the infection are believed to be at 
Guayaquil on the west coast of South America, 
in a region along the south shores of the Carib- 
bean Sea, in a strip along the north Brazilian 
coast, and in a certain area on the west coast of 
Africa. General Gorgas, as the leading author- 
ity on yellow fever, was appointed chief of an 
expedition to eliminate infection from these 
regions. He was requested to nominate men for 
his staff and sufficient funds were granted for 
carrying out the undertaking. 
Although General Gorgas has had to devote 
himself to his war duties and the main effort 
has therefore had to be postponed, representa- 
tives of the Board, as scouting parties, have been 
on guard in certain regions. The real fight 
against yellow fever will come when the war is 
over. It is hoped wholly\to exterminate yellow 
fever from the world. 
A FLOATING DISPENSARY AND HOSPITAL 
Dispensaries and physicians have of late been 
peacefully penetrating areas of the Philippine 
Islands and demonstrating the fact that, for 
purposes of placating primitive and suspicious 
peoples, medicine has some advantages over 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  42 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
machine guns. The Sulu Archipelago contains 
300 or more islands almost out of touch with the 
rest of the world. These, with many remote 
villages along the shores of Mindanao, include 
areas which heretofore have not been accessible to 
medical men. In 1915, Bishop Charles H. Brent 
and Dr. Victor G. Heiser, proposed that a dis- 
pensary and hospital ship be equipped and 
manned for service to the populations of the 
Department of Mindanao and Sulu, generally, re- 
ferred to as non-Christians. The International 
Health Board offered to meet the cost of re- 
modeling and fitting out a Government vessel, 
and agreed to contribute towards its main- 
tenance for five years, on condition that at the 
end of that time the entire expenses should be 
assumed by the Philippine authorities. 
On November 12, 1917, the ship “Busuanga”’ 
was put in service. The ship is fitted with a 
modern operating room, a ten-bed hospital 
ward, a pharmacy, and suitable quarters for the 
crew and for the staff, which includes an Ameri- 
can doctor, a Filipino assistant, a bacteriologist, 
an American chief nurse, and two native nurses. 
This floating dispensary will touch regularly 
at points on the coasts of Mindanao and the 
islands of the Sulu Archipelago. Outpatient 
service will be rendered and emergency opera- 
tions performed at each port of call. Cases
-P-A-G-E-45
A FLOATING DISPENSARY AND HOSPITAL © 43 
which require hospital care will be transported 
in the ship’s ward to one of the base hospi- 
tals which have been established at Jolo and 
Zamboanga. 
This experiment will be watched with inter- 
est, for it will have a bearing upon the inter- 
national problem of dealing with backward 
people. It has, moreover, general significance 
for the development of a system of mobile dis- 
pensaries operating from a base hospital. The 
principle may find expression equally well in a 
motor-car dispensary, with doctor and nurse, 
operating through a rural area from a general 
hospital in an American county. 
MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR CHINA 
Looked at world-wise, it is not far from the 
Philippines to China, where, through its China 
Medical Board (under General Director Wal- 
lace Buttrick), The Rockefeller Foundation is 
working out a demonstration of modern medi- 
cal education and hospital administration. On 
September 24, 1917, the Minister of Education 
of the Chinese Republic laid the corner-stone of 
a new institution, the Peking Union Medical 
College, which the Board is building in the 
Chinese capital. This group of laboratories, 
hospital wards, service buildings, and _ staff 
residences will embody all the approved features 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  44 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
of a modern medical center. The external 
forms will, however, be in harmony with the 
best traditions of Chinese architecture, and will 
thus symbolize a desire to make the college not 
something imposed from without, but an agency 
which shall in time become an intimate, organic 
part of a developing Chinese civilization. 
In order to prepare students to enter the new 
medical college it has been deemed best to es- 
tablish in Peking a pre-medical school which 
among other things will ensure proper grounding 
in physics, chemistry and biology, and in the 
English language, in which instruction in the 
college is to be conducted. Such a school was 
opened in Peking in September, 1917, with a 
faculty of five instructors and a student enrol-. 
ment of eight. Six members of the college fac- 
ulty have been appointed; and unless the war 
. creates still further difficulties it is expected that, 
with a complete staff and fully equipped new 
buildings, the college will open its doors to stu- 
dents in September, 1919. 
The program for China calls also for a medi- 
cal school and hospital at Shanghai. The war 
has made necessary the postponement of this 
building project. The difficulty of securing a 
staff, the high cost of building materials, the 
unfavorable condition of foreign exchange, all 
forbid a present beginning. During the year
-P-A-G-E-47
MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR CHINA 45 
1917, the Shanghai Medical School has been 
incorporated, trustees have been appointed, a 
provisional charter has been secured from the 
Regents of the University of New York, and 
an acting dean, Dr. H. S. Houghton, has been 
chosen. Plans for buildings are being prepared. 
Instead of establishing a separate pre-medical 
school in Shanghai, the Board has decided to 
help certain existing institutions to strengthen 
their curricula and to increase their staffs. Funds 
have been appropriated to three missionary col- 
leges of unquestioned rank toward the cost of 
laboratories and equipment, and for additional 
instructors. In order to establish standards for 
the guidance of the Board in making future 
grants, the Trustees have expressed a willingness 
to finance an educational survey to be made by 
experts under the auspices of a joint committee, 
on which the leading missionary societies will be 
represented. A survey of this kind should result 
in the classification of institutions, the setting 
of minimum standards, and the working out of 
a comprehensive educational program. 
HOSPITAL SUBSIDIES AND TRAVELING 
SCHOLARSHIPS 
The medical schools in Peking and Shanghai 
cannot be successful in isolation. They must 
work in close relations with the preparatory  
-P-A-G-E-48
  46 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
schools, the hospitals, the medical missionaries, 
and the modernly trained native physicians who 
form the nucleus of the new medical profession 
gradually being created to meet the needs of an 
awakened China. ‘This cooperation has already 
taken the form of grants to schools which have 
been mentioned, and of subsidies to missionary 
hospitals. During 1917 nearly $50,000 was 
given to hospitals in a dozen centers of North- 
ern and Central China. 
For a number of years the China Medical 
Board’s hospitals. will provide a sufficient num- 
ber of internships for the graduates of the 
Peking and Shanghai schools, but in time it will 
become necessary to place students as interns 
in outside hospitals. The strengthening and 
standardizing of a number of such hospitals is 
so important that the Board has been willing 
to have a share in stimulating progress in this 
direction. A study of the situation serves only 
to make one realize more vividly how much has 
been accomplished by devoted and self-sacri- 
ficing medical missionaries in China. 
The new schools and hospitals in Peking and 
Shanghai will enable the medical missionaries 
to keep abreast of current discoveries and pro- 
cedures in medicine, surgery, and public health. 
Frequent short courses at one of these schools 
will prove in some respects more valuable than

study at long intervals in the medical institu- 
tions of the United States and Europe. Pend- 
ing, at any rate, the completion of the new 
schools, the China Medical Board is granting 
fellowships and scholarships to medical mis- 
sionaries for study in this country. Aid is 
also being given to native physicians, nurses, 
and students to pursue courses in American 
institutions. 
A substantial beginning in the encouragement 
of student migration on a world-wide basis has 
been made. During the year 1917, Foundation 
funds to the amount of $45,487.24 enabled 57 
individuals to come to the United States for 
training. The group included: one Brazilian 
doctor, three Chinese pharmacists, three Chinese 
nurses, seven Chinese students, 12 Chinese 
physicians, and 31 medical missionaries from 
China. 
The possibilities of extending this plan under 
the auspices of international committees are 
being considered. Overtures have come re- 
cently from French and Japanese sources. While 
there will be no concerted scientific boycott after 
the war, international intercourse in research 
and teaching will inevitably seek many new 
channels. The United States will undoubtedly 
play an increasingly important part in the scien- 
tific collaboration of the world.

48 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
FOSTERING MEDICAL RESEARCH AND 
EDUCATION 
The growth of the Rockefeller Institute for 
Medical Research has called for increasing sums 
both for equipment and for current expenses. 
The higher cost of services and supplies has of 
late demanded still larger maintenance funds. 
For the last two years the Foundation has voted 
grants for building projects and for the main- 
tenance of the Institute. During 1917 the sum 
of $2,000,000 was appropriated as an addition 
to its endowment. By these gifts substantial 
contribution has been made by the Foundation 
to the work of medical research, the results of 
which have been of signal importance. Men- 
tion has already been made of the war service 
which the Institute is rendering at this critical 
period. 
Furthermore, research and medical education 
have been fostered by the Foundation not only 
through the Institute and in China and South 
America, but in cooperation with the General 
Education Board in the United States as well. 
Toward the comprehensive program for creating 
a modern medical center at the University of 
Chicago, the Foundation has pledged itself to 
give $1,000,000.
-P-A-G-E-51
FOSTERING MEDICAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION 49 
THE FOUNDATION AS AN INTERNATIONAL 
FORCE 
The many normal activities of The Rockefeller 
Foundation are not isolated items, each inde- 
pendent of the others. They all fall into a 
world-wide organization in the interests of sci- 
entific knowledge applied to human welfare. 
Research, medical education, public health ad- 
ministration, surveys and commissions, exchange 
of specialists, student migration, are different 
aspects of a large plan and purpose. A glance 
at the map (Fig. 1, pages 6 and 7) on which the 
points of Foundation activities are indicated, 
gives one an impression of world-wide service to 
mankind. 
When at last peace comes, it cannot quickly 
bring universal confidence and good-will. There 
may be years of suspicion and bitterness, of mis- 
understanding and recrimination; there is sure 
to be keen industrial and commercial competi- 
tion. Is it too much to hope that such work as 
the Foundation is doing in many parts of the 
world may tend at least to emphasize the com- 
mon interests of mankind in turning science from 
the destruction of the race to the healing of the 
nations?

To the President of The Rockefeller Foundation: 
Sir: 
I have the honor to submit herewith my 
report on the activities of The Rockefeller 
Foundation for the period January 1, 1917, to 
December 31, 1917. 
Respectfully yours, 
EDWIN R. EMBREE, 
Secretary.

THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
The review by The President outlines the 
policies by which The Rockefeller Foundation is 
being guided in its work, sketches its present 
program, and describes the results aimed at and 
accomplished during the year 1917. The fol- 
lowing report depicts the organization and the 
agencies through which these results were 
reached, and outlines the methods by which 
the programs of the several departments were 
carried out. 
MEMBERSHIP 
At the annual meeting in January, 1917, Wal- 
lace Buttrick, Charles E. Hughes, Julius Rosen- 
wald, and George E. Vincent were added to the 
Board. At the May meeting of the Board Dr. 
Eliot’s resignation was presented and accepted 
with regret. 
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Amendments to the Constitution adopted at 
the annual meeting in January created the new 
position of Chairman of the Board of Trustees. 
To this position Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., 
55
-P-A-G-E-58
\ 
  56 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
formerly President of the Foundation, was 
elected. Dr. George E. Vincent, then President 
of the University of Minnesota, was elected 
President, succeeding Mr. Rockefeller. Mr. 
Edwin R. Embree, of Yale University, was 
elected Secretary, succeeding Mr. Jerome D. 
Greene, who had served as Secretary since the 
organization of the Foundation and whose resig- 
nation, presented during the previous year, was 
accepted with an expression of appreciation of 
his services during the important formative 
period of the Foundation’s history. Mr. L. G. 
Myers and Mr. Robert H. Kirk were reelected 
respectively to the positions of Treasurer and of 
Comptroller. 
MEETINGS 
Regular meetings of the Foundation were held 
in January, May, and October of 1917, the Oc- 
tober meeting being adjourned to December to 
reconvene in accordance with a revised schedule 
of meetings embodied in newly adopted amend- 
‘ments of the Constitution and By-Laws. At the 
December meeting, the officers presented for 
consideration and action the program of work 
for the coming year together with a preliminary 
budget.
-P-A-G-E-59
FUNDS 57 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
The details of the work, within the general 
policies approved by the trustees, were deter- 
mined from time to time by the Executive Com- 
mittee. This Committee meets regularly the 
first Tuesday in each month and at other times 
on call. Twenty-nine meetings were held dur- 
ing the year 1917. ; 
FUNDS 
The funds with which the Foundation carries 
on its work have undergone three important 
alterations during the year. 
1. The general fund, amounting at the begin- 
ning of the year to $100,000,000, was added to 
by a gift from Mr. John D. Rockefeller, re- 
ceived on February 23, of securities of market 
value of $25,765,506. 
A second gift during the year from Mr. 
Rockefeller, received December 29, of $5,500,000, 
was added to income. The following letter from 
Mr. Rockefeller accompanied the gift: 
December 29, 1917. 
Gentlemen: 
In view of the increasing demands upon the funds of 
the Foundation arising in connection with the war, and 
having in mind particularly the large contributions made 
   
-P-A-G-E-60
  
  58 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
to the American Red Cross War Fund and the War Work 
of the Young Men’s Christian Association, I enclose 
herewith my check for $5,500,000 to be used as the 
Foundation may see fit for furthering its corporate 
purposes. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER. 
2. In order to meet the increasing demands 
upon the Foundation arising in connection with 
the war, the Trustees voted to use during the 
year, in addition to income, a part of the princi- 
pal fund. Five million dollars from the princi- 
pal was appropriated during the year and the 
Trustees gave authority to use a second $5,000,- 
000, if necessary. Itis hoped that the gift of $5,- 
500,000 to income from Mr. Rockefeller, received 
at the close of the year, will make it unnecessary 
to use the second $5,000,000 of principal. 
8. The Founder released the Foundation from 
the condition contained in his letter of gift of 
March 6, 1914, which had obligated the Founda- 
tion to hold the sum of $2,000,000 annually for 
objects within the corporate purposes of the 
Foundation which were to be specified by him. 
In releasing the Foundation from this obliga- 
tion, the Founder surrendered all right to desig- 
nate the application of any portion of the income 
of the Foundation. On this occasion Mr. Rocke- 
feller wrote the following letter:
-P-A-G-E-61
' FUNDS 59 
July 19, 1917. 
Gentlemen: 
My letter of gift of March 6, 1914, contained the fol- 
lowing provisions: 
“Tt is a condition of this gift that from the income of 
the Foundation the sum of Two million dollars ($2,000,- 
000), annually, or so much thereof as I shall designate, 
shall be applied during my lifetime to such specific ob- 
jects within the corporate purposes of the Foundation 
as I may from time to time direct. If at the close of any 
fiscal year there shall remain any balance of the $2,000,000 
which I have not thus designated during the fiscal year, 
such balance shall be transferred to the general unre- 
stricted income of the Foundation, to be used as the 
Foundation shall see fit. Subject to the foregoing pro- - 
vision, the principal as well as the income of this gift 
may be used in your discretion for any of the corporate 
purposes of the Foundation.” 
In view of the increasing demands upon funds of the 
Foundation, especially those arising in connection with 
the great war for human freedom in which our country 
is now engaged, which have led the Foundation to appro- 
priate a part of its principal, as well as all of its income, I 
hereby release the conditions set forth in the provisions 
quoted above, and surrender from this date all right to 
designate the application of any portion of the income of 
the Foundation, and release the Foundation from any 
designations heretofore made which have not already been 
paid. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER.

60 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
METHODS OF CARRYING OUT WORK 
The agencies through which the Foundation 
accomplishes its work are of two classes: 
1. Those agencies which it creates to carry 
out specific programs. 
2. Other existing organizations, unaffiliated 
with the Foundation, to which it makes appro- 
priations in order to enable them to carry out 
specific programs. 
Agencies of the first class, that is, subsidiary 
or departmental organizations, have been main- 
tained during the year as follows: (1) The Inter- 
national Health Board, (2) The China Medical 
Board, and (3) The War Relief Commission. 
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
The International Health Board has carried 
on the main branches of the work of the Founda- 
tion in public health in accordance with plans 
approved by the Board and with funds appro- 
priated by the Foundation. 
CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 
The China Medical Board is charged with the 
Foundation’s work in the development of medi- 
cal education in China.
-P-A-G-E-63
  CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 61 
At the May meeting Mr. Frederick T. Gates 
resigned from the position of Vice-chairman of 
the Board, which he had held since its creation 
in 1915, and from membership on the Board. 
Changes in the rules of the Board adopted during 
the year made the President and Secretary of The 
Rockefeller Foundation, ex-officio, Chairman 
and Secretary respectively of the China Medical 
Board. These officers succeeded in these posi- 
tions John D. Rockefeller, Jr., former Chairman, 
and Eben C. Sage, former Secretary. In Dr. 
Buttrick’s absence from America for several 
months during the year, Dr. Houghton, Acting 
Dean of the Shanghai Medical School, acted for 
the Director of the Board. 
WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
The War Relief Commission, which had been 
maintained in Europe since the early months of 
the war, was withdrawn in March, 1917. The 
Foundation, feeling that American effort in 
European relief should be unified, demonstrated 
its continued interest in this field of service by a 
contribution of $5,000,000 to the American Red 
Cross. 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
62 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
ASSISTANCE TO OTHER AGENCIES 
In addition to the work carried out through 
the departmental organizations described above, 
The Rockefeller Foundation has contributed 
during the year to the accomplishment of work 
undertaken by other and unaffiliated organiza- 
tions. 
The work of the year, whether through its 
own agencies or by assistance to unaffiliated 
organizations, has been chiefly within the three 
fields of war work, public health, and medical 
education. 
On pages 63, 64 and 65 (Table 3) will be 
found a summary of payments made by The 
Rockefeller Foundation for all purposes during 
the year 1917. This tabular summary outlines, 
in terms of expenditures, the work described in 
terms of aims and results in the President’s 
report. In many instances these payments 
involve sums expended on account of appro- 
priations made in former years. On the other 
hand, they represent but partial payments on 
many of the appropriations made during 1917, 
which will provide for continuing work during 
succeeding years. For a full statement of the 
finances of the Foundation, see the Report of 
the Treasurer, pages 281 to 344.

  THE YEAR IN BRIEF 
The International Health Board is devoted 
to the work of preventive medicine in the 
United States and other countries. It coop- 
erates with Government in measures designed 
to control hookworm disease and other diseases, 
and assists in the establishment of permanent 
agencies for the promotion of public sanitation 
and the spread of the knowledge of scientific 
medicine. 
During the year 1917, notwithstanding war 
conditions, infection surveys were conducted 
in Tobago, Cayman Islands, and Papua, and 
demonstrations in the relief and control of hook- 
worm disease carried on in 12 states in this 
country and 22 foreign states and countries. 
As a new departure, the Board took its first step 
in the direction of aiding in the control of hook- 
worm disease in mines by conducting a prelimi- 
nary infection survey of Pinghsiang Colliery in 
the Kiangsi Province of China. In close rela- 
tions with the American Red Cross, the Board 
has cooperated with the French Government in 
measures for the control of tuberculosis in France. 
It conducted experiments in Arkansas and 
Mississippi for the purpose of testing measures 
for the control of malaria. Through its Yellow 
77
-P-A-G-E-80
  78 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
Fever Commission it carried on survey work in 
Martinique and Venezuela, in connection with 
the eradication of yellow fever. It cooperated 
with the Philippine Government in placing in 
commission a hospital ship to bring medical and 
surgical relief to the inhabitants of the Sulu 
Archipelago. To provide an opportunity for 
adequate training in public health, it aided in the 
establishment of a Department of Hygiene in 
connection with the Faculty of Medicine at the 
University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The Uncinar- 
iasis Commission which the Board appointed 
and sent to the Orient early in 1915, to conduct a 
scientific investigation with respect to the im- 
portance of hookworm disease as a disabling 
factor in Malaya; returned to America and made 
its report. 
During the year there have been two outstand- 
ing developments: improvement in sanitation 
and increase in local support. Government 
officials have been very energetic in the matter 
of enacting and enforcing legislation aimed at the 
prevention of soil pollution, and public appro- 
priations for the support and extension of the 
work have been greatly increased.

body of one laborer who had died from anemia 
while working on the St. Gotthard tunnel 
(Switzerland). This was in February of the 
year 1880. The post-mortem examination had 
been made by Colomiatti in the presence of many 
doctors and professors, including Perroncito. 
Perroncito was most active in the work of fol- 
lowing up this discovery and eventually suc- 
ceeded in demonstrating the parasitic origin of 
anemia in tunnels and mines. The tunnel 
project was begun in 1872 from both sides at 
once. At the start, 1700 laborers were employed 
on the North end. When the work was com- 
pleted in 1882, all but 60 of the workmen 
originally employed on the project had been 
replaced. Doubtless a considerable proportion 
of this defection was due to the prevalence and 
malignancy of the disease. During the last few 
years of construction, probably 95 per cent. of 
the working force that had been at the tunnel 
for a year were infected.. Two score years 
earlier (1838) Dubini had first discovered hook- 
worms in the body of a peasant woman at the 
hospital of Milan.

CHARACTER OF THE DISEASE 
Hookworm disease is communicable. It is 
caused by a small parasitic worm (Uncinaria), 
about as thick as an ordinary pin and about half 
as long. Thousands of them may live in the 
intestine of a single person: in one case more 
than 6,000 hookworms were passed by a patient 
as a result of treatment. While the female pro- 
duces immense numbers of eggs, these never 
mature within the host, but must leave the body 
with the feces before they can hatch. Under 
proper conditions of air, heat, and moisture, 
they hatch within the brief space of from 24 to 
40 hours. When once hatched, the larvae, or 
young hookworms, too small to be seen with the 
naked eye, may live on and near the surface of 
the ground for many months, and so long as they 
stay in the soil they remain microscopic in size. 
They get back into the body by boring through 
the skin of the bare feet and hands or other por- 
tions of the body which come in contact with 
soil in which they exist, and thus pass into the 
circulating blood of the human host. Their 
entrance through the skin causes an itch which 
has come to be known as ground itch. After 
boring through the skin they enter the lym- 
phatics, are carried through the heart, penetrate 
the lungs, make their way to the throat and are

swallowed, after which they ultimately reach the 
small intestine. Here they grow to maturity 
and remain for seven years, or more, if not dis- 
turbed by treatment. 
EFFECTS OF THE DISEASE 
These parasites nourish themselves by suck- 
ing the blood of the host and perhaps cause 
changes in the blood which tend to destroy 
the hemoglobin. Whatever the process, se- 
vere infections are followed by severe anemia. 
Moreover, persons harboring this infection seem 
to be more susceptible to diseases such as malaria, 
typhoid fever, pneumonia, and_ tuberculosis. 
In the military cantonments it has been clearly 
shown that the incidence of pneumonia is much 
higher among Southern than Northern troops, 
and also that the mortality rate is higher among 
Southern troops. Specifically, a recent report 
of the Surgeon General of the United States 
Army! shows that of two regiments recruited 
from two Gulf States, hookworm infection was 
found in 54 per cent. of the men examined in one 
command, and in 32 per cent. of those in the 
other. An unusually large mortality, due to 
measles and lung and bronchial troubles, was 
reported in these regiments after a recent 
“1 Report for 1917, page 131. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  84 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
epidemic. Measles occurred more frequently 
(ratio, two and one-half to one) in men who had 
hookworm disease. Measles patients, who suf- 
fered also from hookworm disease, were twice as 
susceptible to pneumonia and kindred diseases 
as men free from intestinal infection. It there- 
fore appears probable that hookworm infection, 
by reducing individual resistance, is a very im- 
portant predisposing factor in the acute in- — 
fectious diseases prevalent in army camps. 
Hookworm disease is never spectacular like 
yellow fever or pernicious malaria. And for 
this very reason it is the greater menace. Acute 
diseases sometimes tend to strengthen the race 
by killing off the weak; but hookworm disease, 
working so insidiously as frequently to escape 
the attention even of its victims, tends rather to 
‘debilitate the race by attacking the strong as 
well as the weak. The cumulative effects of 
the disease on the race—physical, economic, 
intellectual, and moral—which are handed down 
from generation to generation through long 
periods of time, are even more important than 
its contribution to the death roll among individ- 
uals. This one disease, where the infection is 
practically universal, may go far towards ex- 
plaining the retardation of backward peoples.  
-P-A-G-E-87
MENACE OF HOOKWORM DISEASE 85 
EXTENT OF THE DISEASE 
There is no doubt that for centuries before 
Dubini discovered the cause of the disease, and 
thus pointed the way to its control, it had been 
prevalent as a distressing and disabling factor 
among the inhabitants of tropical and sub-tropi- 
cal countries in the zone which lies between 
parallels 36° north and 30° south. More than 
one-half the population of the earth live in this 
zone. The degree of infection in the countries 
where the disease prevails varies considerably. 
Some idea of its severity may be gathered from 
the figures of a number of infected regions. In 
one district in the tea gardens of Assam, in the 
Ganges River Valley of India, examination of 
600 persons showed an infection of 99.9 per cent. 
The infection among the rural population of the 
plains of India probably averages 80 per cent. 
Examination in 1910, of nearly 3,000 persons in 
the Amazon region of Brazil, showed an infec- 
tion of approximately 88 percent. It is conserv- 
atively estimated that in the Yangtze Valley 
region of China, 90 per cent. of the farmers 
are infected. The average percentage of infec- 
tion for those areas of Ceylon, Fiji, Seychelles, 
and Siam in which the Board has carried on 
operations is 93.1 per cent. For Ceylon alone 
it is 97 per cent. The work of the Board in

Central America indicates an average infection 
of 63.3 per cent. The average infection in the 
West Indies is 60.9 per cent.; for Dutch Guiana 
it is more than 91 per cent. 
These facts and figures, indicating the extent 
and severity of hookworm disease, suggest that 
the menace is international in character and 
that the question of its control is, therefore, one 
of international concern.

INFECTION SURVEYS 
Preliminary infection surveys are conducted 
in all countries and communities where work 
for the control of hookworm disease is contem- 
plated. These surveys, by making available 
information both as to the geographical distribu- 
tion of the infection and the degree of infection 
for each infected area, give the basis for the 
formulation of a working program. Similar 
surveys, conducted from time to time, help to 
give a definite measure of progress in the work 
of control. (See Fig. 4, page 90.) A number 
of such surveys were carried on or brought to a 
close during the year. The infection survey of 
Rio de Janeiro, which led to the initiation of 
similar undertakings by other states in Brazil, 
and the infection survey of the Pinghsiang Col- 
liery in the Kiangsi Province of China, are de- 
scribed in other parts of this report. 
SURVEY OF PAPUA 
An infection survey of Papua, under the Gov- 
ernment of the Commonwealth of Australia, 
conducted from June 1 to September 1, 1917, 
89 
 
-P-A-G-E-92

  INFECTION SURVEYS 91 
shows the influence of commercial development 
in spreading the disease through native popu- 
lations. Until the plantations were opened in 
Papua, gross clinical symptoms of the disease 
were not reported. The concentration of large 
numbers of laborers on the plantations, without 
adequate measures being taken to prevent soil 
pollution, permitted the infection to spread and 
to increase in severity. The return each year of 
6,000 plantation laborers to the villages, follow- 
ing their periods of indenture on the estates, 
affords many opportunities for the village natives 
to acquire the infection. 
That this is what actually happens is attested 
by the fact that in the survey a rate of infection 
of only 8.5 per cent. was found among village 
natives none of whom had ever worked on or 
visited a plantation, as compared with an average 
rate of 61 per cent. among natives who had. As 
the length of service on estates increases, the rate 
of infection rises, as is indicated in Fig. 5, 
page 92. The climatic conditions and the in- 
sanitary habits of the people of Papua, both on 
the plantations and in the villages, are exceed- 
ingly favorable for the spread of the infection. 
Following the survey, the Government under- 
took the organization of a permanent health 
service for the colony. This service will include 
an ocean-going boat, with a health officer in

charge, designed to bring relief to outlying dis- 
tricts inaccessible by land. The service also 
contemplates, as soon as practicable, the in- 
auguration of active measures for the control of 
hookworm disease. A preliminary appropria- 
tion of approximately $5,000 has been provided 
by the Government for this purpose. 
As a result of the preliminary work done in 
Papua, the Government of Australia has invited 
the Board to cooperate with the health depart- 
ment of Queensland in carrying out a demon- 
stration in the control of hookworm disease in 
that state. An appropriation of approximately 
$7,500 has been made by the Government as its 
share of the expense of the first year’s work. 
SURVEY OF TOBAGO 
An infection survey of Tobago, a dependency 
of Trinidad, established a fairly uniform rate 
of infection throughout the different parishes, 
with little variation due to topography, culti- 
vation, river courses, or soil formation. This 
even distribution of the infection has probably 
resulted from the fondness ‘of the natives for 
traveling on foot from one part of the island to 
another. In the course of this survey, 2,414 
persons were examined among a total population 
of approximately 22,142, and 63 per cent. of 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
94 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
those examined were found infected. Most of 
the people examined lived in the vicinity of 
large towns and villages. The degree of indi- 
vidual infection was found to be fairly heavy. 
SURVEY OF CAYMAN ISLANDS 
An infection survey of the Cayman Islands, 
British West Indies (a dependency of Jamaica), 
was conducted during the spring of 1917. The 
work was undertaken at the request of the Gov- 
ernment of Jamaica. The combined popula- 
tion of the three islands composing this group— 
Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac, and Little 
i Cayman—is 5,250. . In the survey 1,340 persons 
were examined, of whom 228, or 17.0 per cent., 
were found infected. In Grand Cayman, the 
average rate of infection was 20 per cent., with 
"a variation ranging from three to 55 per cent. in 
different parts of the island. In Cayman Brac, it 
was eight per cent., with a variation from two to 
14 per cent. No infected persons were found in 
Little Cayman. The rate of infection was highest 
in the towns lying nearest the mangrove swamps 
of which the eastern parts of both Grand Cayman ~ 
and Cayman Brac are largely composed. The 
proximity of these swamps, with their density of 
shade-growth, bears an important relation to 
the percentage of infection in the towns.

  INFECTION SURVEYS 97 
Elsewhere throughout the islands the infec- 
tion has not taken a firm foothold. Because of 
the lack of shade and moisture in those portions 
of the islands that are formed of coral rock, 
there is little likelihood of the disease being 
widely spread. The enforcement of satisfactory 
regulations governing the disposal of human 
excrement, and the attention paid in the Gov- 
ernment schools to the teaching of hygiene and 
sanitation, also play their part in preventing the 
further spread of the infection. 
Following the survey of the Cayman Islands, 
the Government of Jamaica voted an appro- 
priation of approximately $12,000 for the pur- 
pose of initiating a campaign, in cooperation 
with the Board, against hookworm disease in 
the Island proper. It was understood and 
agreed that the Board would make an infection 
survey. The Board further agreed that, if the 
survey should reveal conditions calling for 
systematic measures for relief and control, it 
would conduct demonstrations in a few selected 
areas. The Government, for its part, agreed 
to supply the necessary drugs and printing, and 
to organize, as soon as might be practicable, a 
sanitary department under central adminis- 
tration. The Government further agreed that, 
if relief measures should be undertaken, the 
areas in which the work would be done would be 
supplied with latrine accommodations in advance 
of the examination and treatment of the people.

PLANS OF OPERATION 
In the progress of the work two plans of 
operation for control have been developed. 
One is known as the dispensary plan; the other 
as the intensive plan. In the first plan, the 
work of examining, treating, and educating the 
people centers around the free traveling dispen- 
sary, and has the advantage of covering large 
areas and of reaching large numbers of people 
in a comparatively short time; in the other 
plan, the work is limited for a definite time to a 
restricted area, and has the advantage of greater 
thoroughness in detail. 
DISPENSARY PLAN 
The dispensary plan provides for the organi- 
zation of mobile dispensaries which visit periodi- 
cally those towns and villages that are most con- 
- veniently located. They offer free examination 
and free treatment to all who apply. The staff 
(a physician and a corps of assistants) is equipped 
with microscopes, specimen containers, hemo- 
globinometers, the necessary drugs, record forms, 
camera, lantern and slides, charts, leaflets, and a 
98 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
PLANS OF OPERATION 99 
supply of exhibit material for conducting effective 
educational work. The dispensary does not un- 
dertake to examine the whole population, but only 
those people who apply. It dispenses drugs to 
those who need and desire treatment, but does not 
administer treatment under direct supervision. 
It is true that it cannot follow up its first treat- 
ments with continued reexamination and re- 
treatment until cure has been demonstrated, 
nor does it remain in one place long enough to 
effect conspicuous results in sanitation which 
can be measured and recorded as definitely 
accomplished. Nevertheless, experience has 
shown that the dispensary is an effective means 
of bringing speedy relief and definite instruction 
to large numbers of people distributed over wide 
areas of territory. 
Diagnoses are by microscopic examination 
of the feces, the presence of infection being 
determined by the presence of eggs of the para- 
site in the patient’s stool. The field director is 
given as many microscopists as are needed to do 
the work. By the dispensary plan of operation 
practically the whole infected area of 11 South- 
ern States was covered in a period of three 
years, 750,000 persons were treated, and 20,000,- 
000 people were educated both as to the im- 
portance of the disease and as to efficient 
measures for its relief and control. 
   
-P-A-G-E-102
100 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
INTENSIVE PLAN 
The purpose of work by the intensive plan is 
to demonstrate the possibilities of a direct and 
definite attack upon a prevailing disease. The 
hope is that such temporary measures as are 
brought into use for the relief and control of 
hookworm disease may be in the nature of a 
first step toward the establishment of permanent 
agencies which shall in time apply similar or 
better methods to the control of all diseases. 
The most effective work, therefore, is that which 
succeeds in creating so keen a realization of 
benefit that the public is prepared not only to 
cooperate in further and more comprehensive 
undertakings of similar nature, but to insist 
that permanent agencies be established to con- 
tinue and enlarge the work. 
By the intensive plan, an attempt is made to 
approximate complete relief and control of hook- 
worm disease within a given area. Trials with 
this method in Peter’s Hall District, British 
Guiana, and in other selected areas, definitely 
established it as the prevailing type. Under 
this plan, a territorial unit of operations may be a 
county, or it may be any small, well-defined 
area containing from 1,000 to 15,000 people. 
For purposes of convenience and efficiency in 
practical administration, the large unit areas are 
divided into a number of small districts.

PLANS OF OPERATION 103 
SCHEME OF ORGANIZATION 
The scheme of organization which has proved 
most satisfactory for conducting operations 
provides for two staffs. One of these staffs— 
the one which is in part financed by the Board— 
devotes itself to the work of examining, treating, 
and educating the people. This staff usually 
consists of a doctor in charge, who is called the 
field director, two clerks, four microscopists, 12 
nurses, and one or two caretakers. The other 
staff—the one which is supported by the Gov- 
ernment—devotes itself to the task of introduc- 
ing and maintaining the necessary sanitary 
measures designed to put a stop to soil pollution 
and thus prevent reinfection. The one is essen- 
tially a temporary organization; the other is 
permanent. While both staffs work under the, 
authority of the Government and under the 
general supervision of the department of health, 
it has been found desirable to keep the two 
organizations distinct. The staff that examines 
and treats the people, and which for that reason 
works with a minimum of friction, is able at the 
same time to educate them to an understanding 
of the sanitary needs, thereby making it possible 
for the other staff to carry out its work with less 
necessity for compulsion. Another advantage 
of this plan of organization is that it provides 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
104 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
opportunity for Government to build up its 
permanent sanitary organization gradually, as 
the work advances from area to area, and as a 
sustaining public sentiment is developed. 
The work to be carried out involves mapping 
the district (locating roads, streams, and houses), 
taking a census of the population (numbering 
the houses in which the people live, recording 
name, age, sex, race, and post-office address), 
making microscopic examination of the entire 
population, administering treatment to all per- 
sons found to be infected, and continuing treat- 
ment of each patient until cure is effected. 
While this work is in progress the people are 
taught the essential facts, both as to the nature 
of hookworm disease and as to methods of con- 
trol. This is done by personal instruction in 
house-to-house visits, by the distribution of 
pamphlets and leaflets, and by illustrated lec- 
tures. In all this work, chief emphasis is 
placed on the prevention of soil contamination. 
EFFECTIVENESS OF CURATIVE WORK 
Although it is seldom possible to examine 
every resident of an intensive area, or to treat 
until cured every person found infected, the 
cooperation of the people has made it possible 
to maintain very high average results. In St.  
-P-A-G-E-107
PLANS OF OPERATION 105 
‘Vincent the entire population of one area (more 
than 2,500 inhabitants) was examined, while 
the percentage examined of the total population 
of this and eight other areas in the same island 
was 99.6. Only 77 persons out of a total 
population of 20,390 refused to be examined. 
For the West Indian colonies as a whole, during 
the three and one-half years that intensive work 
has been in progress, a total of 165,099 per- 
sons have been enumerated in the census, and 
of this number only 1,124, or seven-tenths of 
one per cent., refused to submit specimens for 
examination. 
The number of cures ranges from 75 per cent. 
to 90 per cent. of the number of persons infected. 
In no area has it been found practicable to 
demonstrate, by microscopic examination fol- 
lowing treatment, that 100 per cent. of the in- 
fected persons had been cured. There is always 
a small remnant who, for medical reasons or be- 
cause of refusal to begin or continue treatment, 
remain uncured in the areas at the close of the 
work. In Fiji and the Seychelles Islands, in the 
All Saints district in Antigua, and in the Boga- 
wantalawa area in Ceylon, more than 90 per 
cent. of the infected persons were cured. Elimi- 
nating from consideration the group that, for 
medical reasons, could not be treated, the per- 
centage cured in these four areas was approxi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
106 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
mately 95. There is no way, during the prog- 
ress of the work, to cure the persons who for 
medical reasons are not treated, because these 
include emaciated persons, pregnant women, 
and sufferers from acute heart or kidney affec- 
tions or other debilitating causes which would 
make treatment hazardous. 
For all the West Indian colonies combined, 
only 17 per cent. of those originally infected 
remained behind as carriers of infection. Per- 
sons who, for medical reasons, could not be 
treated accounted for approximately one-fourth 
of those uncured, the remaining three-fourths 
being about equally divided between those who 
refused to take or to continue treatment, and 
those who had been treated once or oftener but 
had not yet been cured when the work was 
moved to other areas. Statistics show that re- 
fusals to be treated until cured, although more 
frequent than refusals to be ‘examined, are met 
with, on an average, in six per cent. of the in- 
fected cases. In Fiji, among the 3,088 persons 
so far found to be infected, not one refusal to take 
or to continue treatment has yet been recorded. 
EFFECTIVENESS OF SANITARY WORK 
The most important of the many results of 
intensive work is the permanent sanitary im-
-P-A-G-E-109
PLANS OF OPERATION 107 
provement which it effects. In 66 of the 303 
communities in the Southern States in which 
this type of work was conducted up to Decem- 
ber 31, 1917, not a home was left without a 
latrine. Embraced within the boundaries of 
these 66 communities were 7,738 homes, of 
which 5,885, or 76 per cent., had latrines when 
the work started. When the work was finished 
the percentage of homes with latrines had been 
raised from 76 to 100. Many homes credited 
with having latrines at the beginning of the 
work had the open-back, open-seat type which 
does not prevent: soil pollution. During the 
progress of the work almost all of these were 
changed to latrines either of the pit type or of 
some other type approved by the health author- 
ities of the respective states. Only 61 per cent. 
of the 32,468 homes inspected in all of these 303 
communities had latrines of any kind when the 
work began; when the work was concluded 82 
per cent. had improved latrines. In the Sey- 
chelles Islands, in district No. 2 of the South 
Mahe area, every one of the 740 homes now has 
a latrine, although only seven were so equipped 
when the work began. In district No. 2 of the 
Central Mahe area, embracing 553 homes, all 
but six now have latrines, although only 15 
had them when the work began. In Guatemala, 
during the third quarter of the year, 761 new
-P-A-G-E-110
108 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
latrines, each accommodating from 12 to 20 per- 
sons, were installed. These latrines were suf- 
ficient to supply accommodations for 11,519 
persons, or 96 per cent. of all those living within 
the areas of operation. 
HOW INTENSIVE WORK IS CARRIED OUT 
Although in each state or country the inten- 
sive work is limited to one small area at a time— 
in order to permit the staff to concentrate its 
energies on these small areas until they are com- 
pleted—the work is nevertheless projected in 
such manner that eventually the whole area of 
the country, or the whole of its heavily infected 
territory, will be covered. The map of Costa 
Rica (See Fig. 10, page 109) illustrates how this 
is done. In interpreting this map it should be 
borne in mind that the extent of territory cov- 
ered during any one year depends on the den- 
sity of the population and the facilities for 
travel and communication within the areas. 
The large amount of territory marked to be 
covered during the year 1920 does not mean that 
the work during that year will necessarily be on a 
larger scale than during former years, but that 
the staff will be working in regions which have 
fewer inhabitants. Nor should it be inferred 
from this map that it is customary to cover

the whole territory of every country in which 
work is conducted. Where the infection is not 
so widespread as in Costa Rica, the work may be 
planned to omit the regions of lightest infection. 
DEVELOPMENT FROM DISPENSARY TO INTENSIVE 
PLAN OF WORK 
The best results are obtained from the inten- 
sive plan when the people understand something 
of the nature of the disease and have some reali- 
zation of its importance. Experience in the 
Southern States has demonstrated that favor- 
able public sentiment is a necessary prerequisite 
to successful intensive work. The dispensary— 
by means of lectures, demonstrations, and 
striking examples of the improvement in health 
which results from treatment—provides a con- 
venient vehicle for carrying this knowledge into 
remote regions of infected countries, and goes 
far towards creating this favorable public senti- 
ment. For this reason it is often an advantage 
in new countries to have the work conducted, 
at least for a limited time at its beginning, ac- 
cording to the dispensary plan. 
The history of the recent work in Siam, as in 
the Southern States, Trinidad, Grenada, Costa 
Rica, and Nicaragua, affords an instance of 
activities originally beginning by the dispensary  
-P-A-G-E-113
PLANS OF OPERATION 111 
plan of work and gradually developing into the 
intensive method of control. The work was 
started in Siam early in 1917 by the installation 
of an exhibit at the provincial exposition held 
at Bangkok. This exhibit served to awaken a 
lively interest in the subject of hookworm disease 
and its treatment, and in the possibility of con- 
trolling other diseases suggested by the measures 
employed against hookworm disease. It is 
estimated that at least 5,000 persons, including 
members of the royal family and many public 
officials, saw the exhibit during the six days of 
the Fair. j 
At the close of the exposition a dispensary was 
established in Chiengmai, a city in the northern 
part of Siam. Here soldiers, school children, 
prisoners, and inmates of leper colonies, as well 
as the residents of Chiengmai and surrounding 
villages, were examined and treated. The in- 
fluence of this initial work, soon spreading into 
towns and villages far removed from the center 
of operations, led to requests that staff members 
be sent to examine and treat the inhabitants. 
In this way large numbers of people became 
acquainted with the nature of the disease and 
many of these expressed themselves as anxious 
to cooperate in conducting campaigns for its 
control. Meanwhile, at intervals during the 
year, ten areas in Chiengmai were opened on 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  112 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
the intensive plan, and by the close of the year 
the major part of all the work was becoming 
intensive in character. 
The distinguishing characteristic of the inten- 
sive plan of operations is that it is a practical 
demonstration, in a limited area, of the possi- 
bility of controlling hookworm disease in all 
infected areas. At the same time it serves to 
point the way towards the ultimate control of 
other preventable diseases by similar methods of 
direct attack. Its employment usually results 
in the enactment of legislation for the prevention 
of soil pollution! and involves the appointment 
of a number of sanitary inspectors whose duty it 
is to see that the regulations are enforced. 
These inspectors furnish the nucleus of a per- 
manent sanitary staff whose efforts, although in 
the beginning directed primarily against hook- 
worm disease, may in course of time be extended 
to include the application of measures designed 
for the control of other diseases as well. 
1During 1917, laws for the prevention of soil contamination were 
enacted by Dutch Guiana, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Fiji, the Seychelles 
Islands, the Federal District and the States of Rio de Janeiro and Sao 
Paulo in Brazil, and by certain towns and counties in the Republic of 
Salvador and in the States of North and South Carolina.

TREATMENT FOR HOOKWORM DISEASE 
The war against hookworm disease may be 
described as a series of offensive campaigns, or 
drives, in which the immediate objective of 
treatment is the relief of the patient and the 
ultimate objective such sanitary reform as will 
bring permanent control. It has not been found 
practical to begin by. enacting measures of reg- 
ulation. The people must first be convinced of 
the necessity of such legislation, and experience 
has shown that actual treatment offers the line 
of least resistance in the education of the people. 
DRUGS USED IN TREATMENT 
In recent years many remedies have been 
given a trial in the treatment of hookworm disease. 
Thymol and chenopodium stand out as being 
much more efficacious than any of the others. 
There is considerable difference _of opinion 
among men of large experience as to whether 
thymol or chenopodium is the better drug to use. 
During the year much information relating 
to the use of oil of chenopodium in the treatment 
of hookworm disease has become available. 
113 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  114 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
The directors of the work in Fiji and in the 
Seychelles Islands have used this drug exclusively 
in treating more than 13,000 cases, and in their 
experience have met with scarcely an untoward 
symptom. Seventy-three per cent. of the per- 
sons treated in the Fiji Islands were cured 
by two treatments. .On reexamination, six 
months after the original treatments were 
given, only 10 per cent. of these patients were 
found to be infected. The Board’s Uncinariasis 
Commission to the Orient showed, under experi- 
mental conditions with a comparatively small 
number of cases, that one treatment of cheno- 
podium had an efficiency, based on the propor- 
tion of worms removed to worms harbored, of 
96 per cent., as compared with an efficiency 
of 89 per cent. for thymol, of 47 per cent. for 
eucalyptus, and of 27 per cent. for Beta-naphthol. 
SMALLER DOSAGE OF CHENOPODIUM RECOMMENDED 
In Ceylon, Panama, Dutch Guiana, Brazil, 
and a number of other countries, alarming 
symptoms, or death, have sometimes followed 
the administration of chenopodium. Appar- 
ently the dosage heretofore recommended in 
the literature is too high. The Uncinariasis 
Commission found that the efficiency of 99 per 
cent. obtained by a single treatment of cheno-
-P-A-G-E-117
TREATMENT FOR HOOKWORM DISEASE 115 
podium, consisting of three mils of the oil, divided 
into three doses and administered at hourly 
intervals, was reduced to only 95 per cent. when 
the dose was cut in half; while two of the half- 
dose treatments, administered with at least ten 
days intervening, produced an efficiency, in 39 
cases, of 99 per cent. When the smaller dose 
was used untoward after-effects were rare. 
This experience led the Commission to recom- 
mend 1.5 mils of chenopodium, divided into three 
doses of 0.5 mil each,'as the standard treatment 
for hookworm disease. In routine practice a 
light meal was given on the evening before 
treatment. This was followed by a purgative 
dose of magnesium sulphate. A very light 
breakfast, consisting of milk, or konje, was given 
on the morning of treatment. The regular 
dosage was a half mil, or 8 minims, of chenopo- 
dium at 7:00 A. M., followed by similar doses at 
8:00 A. M.and at 9:00 A.M. At11:00 o’clock 
a purgative dose of magnesium sulphate was 
again administered. It is declared, in some 
quarters, that when castor oil is used as a pur- 
gative the number of cases of poisoning is re- 
duced. The experience of the Commission, 
however, shows that magnesium sulphate is a 
safer and more efficient purgative than castor 
oil. 
During the latter months of the year the 
8
-P-A-G-E-118
116 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
smaller doses of chenopodium were used in many 
countries, with a decided decrease in the num- 
ber of cases of poisoning. An analysis of the 
cases of poisoning, following treatment, which 
have been brought to the attention of the Board, 
shows that only one-fourth were among persons 
more than 12 years of age, while of the three- 
fourths occurring in children under this age more 
than one-half were among children less than 
seven years old. This suggests that the propor- 
_ tionate reduction in children’s doses, as arrived 
at by Young’s rule, may not be sufficiently 
great, and that the advisability of smaller pro- 
portionate doses should be seriously considered. 
Experience would therefore seem to warrant 
the conclusion that the maximum doses of 
chenopodium recommended in the literature 
are unsafe. However, oil of chenopodium has 
such great anthelmintic value, not only for 
hookworm but/for ascaris and other parasites, 
that the desirability of discovering methods for 
its safe employment justifies additional effort. 
POST-CAMPAIGN MEASURES AND FEWER TREATMENTS 
Arrangements have been made with the Gov- 
ernment and planters of Ceylon for carrying out 
post-campaign measures on all estates on which 
the work of treatment has been completed.

TREATMENT FOR HOOKWORM DISEASE 119 
These measures will continue for a period of 18 
months following the close of the initial demon- 
stration on each estate, and will be under the 
supervision of a Government medical officer, 
assisted by microscopist-dispensers, trained in 
regular campaign work. At the end of the 18 
months’ period of organized post-campaign 
measures, the estate dispensers will be expected 
to handle the situation, which will consist mainly 
of the treatment of small groups of new laborers 
coming to the estates from time to time. 
In an attempt to relieve the laborers from the 
ill effects of continued purgation and treatment 
in obstinate cases, the plan of administering not 
more than four treatments to any patient, and 
of depending upon post-campaign measures to 
complete the cure of those remaining infected, 
was carried out on two estates in the Matale 
area which had not been provided with latrines. 
On one of these estates, 86 per cent. of the 
infected persons were cured by four or fewer 
treatments; on the other, all those medically fit 
for treatment were cured. The method of 
administering a small number of treatments and 
of depending upon post-campaign measures to 
complete the cure of cases which remain in- 
fected, is of course more economical than the 
plan of treating each patient until he is cured. 
The plan will be given further trial during 1918.
-P-A-G-E-122

TREATMENT OF EMIGRANTS OVER-SEAS 
It has become evident that hookworm infection 
is being extensively carried into Ceylon, Malaya, 
Fiji, the West Indies, and other parts of the 
globe by emigrant laborers from Southern India. 
With the idea of preventing, if possible, the 
spread of the disease in this manner, the Trinidad 
Government, late in 1915, undertook to see that 
laborers coming to Trinidad from India were,- 
upon arrival, free of hookworm infection. To 
this end, the expedient was tried of treating on 
shipboard, during the voyage from Calcutta to 
Trinidad, all laborers suspected of being infected- 
The report of the first voyage on which this plan 
was carried out is interesting as showing what 
can be accomplished by this means toward 
checking the spread of infection into pe 
countries. 
Once each week for four successive weeks, 
without preliminary microscopic examination, 
594 of the 660 laborers on board were treated. 
The only ones not treated were infants and 
pregnant women who were unable to take treat- 
ment. All but six of these 594 patients were 
examined after they had taken four treatments, 
and 508 were found negative. The voyage 
terminated before the other 80 patients (13 
per cent. of the total treated) could be freed of
-P-A-G-E-123
TREATMENT FOR HOOKWORM DISEASE 121 
the infection. As indicating the rate of infec- 
tion that might have been expected among these 
laborers but for the measures of relief, 17 preg- 
nant women who could not be treated were 
microscopically examined on arrival and all 
but one were found infected. 
ECONOMIC RESULTS OF TREATMENT 
Maximum efficiency, both of machines and of 
men, is necessary as a war measure; hence every 
belligerent country is putting forth every effort 
to eliminate waste and to increase production. 
After the war, during the period of reconstruc- 
tion, there will be even greater need for econo- 
mizing the resources both of wealth and of health. 
The economic significance of uncinariasis as a 
disabling disease is therefore highly important. 
Some indication of this economic significance is 
suggested by the following examples of increase 
in hemoglobin index following treatment, for 
there is, of course, a close relation between 
working efficiency and the degree of anemia. 
In Porto Rico, by treating the people who came 
voluntarily to the dispensaries, the general aver- 
age of the hemoglobin index, as estimated for the 
total population over a large area where the test 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
122 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
was made, was raised from 43 in 1904 ‘to 72 in 
1914.1 
In Dutch Guiana, hemoglobin tests were 
made of a group of 711 infected persons before 
they had been treated, and again six months or 
more after they had been treated. These tests 
showed that the average percentage of hemo- 
globin in the group was 71 before treatment and 
90 after treatment. (See Fig. 15, page 123.) 
In Costa Rica, hemoglobin tests of 18,172 
infected persons before treatment showed an 
index of 62. After treatment for hookworm 
disease, the index of 6,451 of these persons was 75. 
The index for a group of 8,815 persons found un- 
infected on first examination was 73. (See 
Fig. 16, page 124.) 
The laboring incapacity of the prisoners in 
the Sapele prison, Nigeria, was reduced within 
a period of nine months from 87 per cent. to five 
per cent. by the examination of the 150 inmates, 
by the treatment of those found infected, and 
by strict enforcement of sanitary measures.? 
Lieut.-Col. Clayton Lane, of the Indian Medi- 
cal Service, has estimated that although the 
treatment and cure of hookworm disease in the 
laboring population of India should increase its

TREATMENT AS A MEANS OF EDUCATION 
Worthy as would be the endeavor to relieve 
the physical suffering and increase the personal 
efficiency of those who are afflicted with hook- 
worm disease, it cannot be said too plainly, nor 
repeated too often, that the most important 
objective is to educate the people of an infected 
community or country, both as to the cause of 
the disease and as to the means of preventing it, 
so that they themselves, with the aid of Gov- 
ernment, will initiate and maintain those pri- 
mary reforms in sanitation that will ensure per- 
‘manent control. There is no more effective 
means of popular education on this subject than 
systematic treatment. When properly con- 
ducted, the work of treatment teaches the people 
by demonstration what the disease is, and what 
it means to them as a menace to their health 
and working efficiency. Moreover, it teaches 
them how they get it and how they can prevent 
it. Thus it enlists their interest in carrying into 
effect the necessary sanitary measures that will 
guarantee prevention. : 
It may therefore be said that the work of 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
    
   126 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
treatment is essentially educational. The field 
directors, in the course of their routine labors, 
tell the story of hookworm disease to the people 
in simple terms and in varied graphic forms. 
Pulpit and press are both enlisted and large 
use is made of pamphlets, leaflets, and circular 
letters. Among the natives in many of the 
tropical countries the story must be presented 
in the most direct and concrete terms. Among 
these primitive people the field directors rely 
largely upon telling the story by word of mouth, 
and as they tell it they illustrate its details 
by means of lantern slides and photographs. 
Typical cases are used as object-lessons and 
gross clinical symptoms pointed out. Specimens 
of the patients’ stools are shown, and the eggs 
of the parasite exhibited under the microscope. 
The parasites actually expelled by treatment 
are also shown, as are the living, squirming 
embryos that live by teeming thousands in the 
soil that has been befouled by an infected person. 
The recovery that follows treatment and cure 
tells its own story, both to the patient and to 
his friends and neighbors. The disease thus 
lends itself so readily to simple demonstration 
that even the ignorant natives of tropical 
countries easily understand its whole story. 
Moreover, the relief and control of hookworm 
disease is an object-lesson in the relief and control
-P-A-G-E-129
  TREATMENT FOR HOOKWORM DISEASE 127 
of disease in general. Having seen this one 
disease brought under control and having had 
the worth of the effort brought home, people are 
prepared to give heed when spoken to about dis- 
eases that are not so easily controlled. This is 
the principal reason why the funds and labors of 
the International Health Board have been, for 
four years, devoted so largely to efforts looking 
toward the control of hookworm disease. 
TREATMENT AS A MEANS OF CONTROLLING 
HOOKWORM DISEASE 
That systematic treatment for hookworm 
disease is efficacious in reducing the degree of 
infection has been repeatedly demonstrated. 
Pending the completion of studies now in prog- 
ress, no definite statement as to the amount of 
reduction in infection following treatment in 
the Southern States is warranted. Figure 17, 
page 128, compares, for the 48 counties in those 
States in which both dispensary and intensive 
work have been conducted, the rate of hookworm 
infection found among all persons examined at 
the beginning of dispensary work prior to De- 
cember 31, 1914, with that found among all 
persons examined in the same counties at the 
beginning of intensive work and subsequent to 
January 1, 1915.

It is probable that in the dispensary work a 
larger proportion of infected than of non-infected 
persons responded to the invitation to be ex- 
amined. Nevertheless, these figures indicate 
that for all the counties in which both types of 
work have been conducted, the average infec- 
tion has been reduced from the rate of 37 per 
cent., established by the examination of 83,984 
persons in the earlier dispensary work, to the 
rate of 23 per cent., found by the examination of 
57,008 persons in the later intensive work. 
This exhibit suggests that of every three per- 
sons who formerly had the disease, one is no 
longer infected. 
TREATMENT FOR HOOKWORM DISEASE AS A MEANS 
OF REDUCING GENERAL SICKNESS CALLS 
Figures showing a remarkable reduction in 
sickness calls, for all diseases, following treat- 
ment of estate laborers for hookworm disease, 
are furnished by the superintendent of seven 
estates in Ceylon. On these seven estates the 
work of treatment was carried out during the 
early months of 1917, although in certain in- 
stances it was not completed until November 
and December. This has prevented a complete 
record being obtained of the full benefits result- 
ing from treatment. 
These figures show a decrease of 1,132 calls,

or 44 per cent., during the months of July, 
August, September, October, and November, 
1917, as compared with the same months of 
1916. The largest reduction, 68 per cent., oc- 
curred in the calls for second and third treat- 
ments. This would seem to indicate that the 
improvement in health effected by treatment for 
hookworm disease resulted in the patients being 
more readily cured of this and other diseases. 
(See Fig. 18, page 130.) There was a marked 
decrease in bowel complaints and in malarial 
fevers among the coolies on these estates.

SOIL SANITATION AS A MEANS OF 
CONTROL 
It has been suggested in the previous chapter 
that hookworm disease may be controlled by the 
treatment and cure of infected persons; but 
curing individuals of hookworm infection is of 
comparatively little value unless at the same 
time steps are taken to prevent reinfection. 
Since every embryo in the soil was hatched from 
an egg which came from the intestine of an 
infected person, it follows that if all carriers 
were cured, and kept cured, the soil would 
tend to become sterile and the parasite would 
become extinct. It is also true that, inasmuch 
as the disease is spread through the deposit of 
feces in places where the eggs can thrive and 
the larvae get into the body, its permanent 
prevention is above all else a matter of soil 
sanitation. And soil sanitation is here used to 
indicate the prevention of soil pollution by the 
voiding of excrement and urine into proper 
latrines, instead of indiscriminately upon the 
ground. If that is done the larvae cannot reach 
the human host. 
132 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
SOIL SANITATION AS A MEANS OF CONTROL 138 
PROBLEM OF SEWAGE DISPOSAL 
The seriousness of the problem of sewage 
disposal is indicated by the following figures. 
A survey was made (in 1912-15) in 770 counties 
in 11 states of the United States with a view to 
ascertaining the conditions responsible for the 
prevalence of hookworm infection. At only 
six-tenths of one per cent. of the 287,606 farm 
houses examined were the provisions for the 
prevention of soil contamination reported by 
the state authorities as being satisfactory. At 
142,230 of the homes there were no latrines of 
any kind. 
' Efforts to induce the people to provide and to 
use some form of latrine that will prevent con- 
tamination of the soil have met with a consid- 
erable degree of success. But this very suc- 
cess has created a new problem which cannot 
well be ignored. Simply stated, the problem 
is this: How shall we find a satisfactory method 
for the disposal of sewage at the farm home,— 
one which the people in rural communities can 
be brought to adopt and to carry out, and one 
which will prove to be safe in actual experience 
under the conditions which prevail in these 
communities? It is believed that out of the 
growing volume and variety of experience which 
is being gained there will finally emerge some 
9 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
134 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
form of adjustment that will prove satisfactory. 
Enough has already been done to afford a 
satisfactory basis for a critical study of the rela- 
tive efficiency of the various methods employed. 
This work of experimentation will need to be 
extended over a considerable period of time, and 
should cover a considerable area of field work, in 
order to test experience under a variety of con- 
ditions. As the work progresses from year to 
year it becomes increasingly apparent that the 
control of soil pollution in rural districts, both in 
this country and in foreign countries, would 
have a far-reaching effect in lowering death 
rates and in furthering public health. There is 
little doubt that typhoid, dysentery, diarrhoeal 
diseases—especially those of infants in summer 
time—and similar enteric infections, are to a 
very considerable extent due to the widespread 
custom of polluting the soil. 
The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Re- 
search began, in January, 1916, a series of 
investigations (in a number of communities in 
the Southern States) to ascertain the relative 
efficiency of various types of latrines in soil 
formations of different kinds. The United 
States Hygienic Laboratory, the London School 
of Tropical Medicine, the Indian Research Fund 
Association, and the College of Agriculture and 
Forestry at Nanking, China, have especially
-P-A-G-E-137
SOIL SANITATION AS A MEANS OF CONTROL 135 
interested themselves in the particular problem 
of making feces available as a fertilizer by 
making it biologically safe. Extensive field 
and laboratory investigations along these lines 
have recently been made by the United States 
Hygienic Laboratory. The investigations of the 
London School of Tropical Medicine have estab- 
lished the fact that a substance known as 
“nitroline” does make the feces safe. It has 
not yet, however, been determined what effect 
this substance has upon their fertilizing value. 
SOIL SANITATION IN MANY COUNTRIES 
The demand for commercial appliances for the 
safe disposal of excrement evidenced by the re- 
markable increase in the number of firms engaged 
in their manufacture, is one index of the public 
interest in soil sanitation. These devices range 
from simple sanitary cans without seats, selling 
for less than five dollars, to elaborate septic 
tanks made of cement, with seats for several 
persons, and selling for $100 or more. The 
Board has been in correspondence with 24 manu- 
facturing concerns that sell toilets to the rural 
population of the Southern States, excluding 
those companies selling attachments which can 
be used only in towns and cities having sewerage 
systems. Of the 24, none has been in business

longer than five years and practically all have 
been organized since 1915. Three sell simple 
cans and pails without seats, six market chemical 
toilets, and five (principally large cement man- 
ufacturing concerns) install septic tanks. The 
reports received indicate that since these com- 
panies entered this field they have sold in this 
part of the country more than 7,000 sanitary 
cans, about 3,500 chemical toilets, and nearly 
19,000 septic tanks, or a total of about 30,000 
sanitary appliances of these three main types, 
representing a value of approximately $700,000. 
This is, relatively speaking, a large sum of 
money, for it must be remembered that it repre- 
sents only a part of the voluntary expense as- 
sumed by the people of the South, over a short 
period of time, in the effort to protect themselves 
from the dangers of soil-pollution diseases. 
Kiln Community, Hancock County, Missis- 
sippi, furnishes an excellent example of such 
sanitary reform. When intensive work was 
begun in this community, the preliminary sur- 
vey showed that of a total of 305 homes only 
four had latrine accommodations that could 
be classed as satisfactory to the State Board of 
Health. These four had sewerage facilities. 
The widespread pollution of the soil was, un- 
doubtedly, a contributing cause of the average

daily absence of 20 per cent. of the enrolled 
school children, and was responsible for the 
periodic recurrence of dysentery and typhoid 
epidemics. This conclusion is confirmed by 
the record of diseases. At the time of the first 
survey there were 407 cases of hookworm in- 
fection among the 1,002 residents who were 
microscopically examined—a percentage of 41. 
In addition, during recent years, there have 
been 12 cases of tuberculosis, 47 of typhoid 
fever, 184 of malaria, and 384 of dysentery. 
In all, 238 of the 305 families have had one or 
more cases of diseases which are due to pollution 
of the soil. 
The efforts of the staff to secure latrine accom- 
modations at each home were successful in every 
instance but two. Modern, fly-proof latrines 
were built at 299 homes and 56 additional 
latrines, of the same sort, were erected at the 
churches, at the school, at public gathering- 
places, and at homes where more than one latrine 
was necessary. The maps on page 138 exhibit 
the improvement accomplished during the year. 
In the summer of 1916 there were 47 cases of 
dysentery in the logging communities; in the 
summer of 1917 only one adult and seven chil- 
dren were sick with dysentery. In the interval, 
in addition to the installation of latrines, homes 
had been screened, water had been piped to

each house from a newly bored artesian well, 
garbage cans had been introduced, and the com- 
munity cleaned up generally. Only one case of 
typhoid developed in the community during 
1917. At the close of the work there were but 
two danger spots from which soil-pollution 
diseases were likely to spread. (See Fig. 20, 
page 138, shaded circles.) During 1917, work 
similar to that conducted in the Kiln Commun- 
ity, though not in all cases equally thorough, was 
done in 99 other communities in the Southern 
States. ‘ 
In Virginia, the records of the State Depart- 
ment of Health show that the morbidity from 
typhoid fever has been reduced from 14,400 
cases in 1909 to 5,038 in 1917—a reduction of 
65 per cent. Taking the reduction year by 
year, this represents a total saving in cases of 
typhoid estimated at between 40,000 and 
50,000. The State Commissioner of Health, and 
others familiar with the conditions, attribute 
much of this striking decrease to the work that 
has been done in the prevention of soil pollution. 
There has, probably, been a similar reduction 
in morbidity from transmissible diseases in 
other Southern States where systematic health 
work has been conducted.

140 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
In British Guiana, during 1917, the Govern- 
ment, through its corps of sanitary inspectors, 
supervised the erection of 1,911 new latrines 
and the repairing of 2,658 old ones. These in- 
spectors, who are required to pass rigid exami- 
nations based on a course of instruction in sani- 
tation, are paid by the villages in which they 
work, but are under the authority of the Local 
Government Board, a central executive body of 
the Colonial Government. This plan of control 
removes the possibility of interference by the 
village authorities, some of whom are natives 
quite ignorant of sanitation. The inspectors are 
located in districts of about 5,000 inhabitants. 
They usually remain permanently in one dis- 
trict, and it is their duty to see that good condi- 
tions are not merely established but maintained. 
Each year, as the finances of Government permit, 
additional sanitary inspectors are appointed 
for other districts, thus gradually extending the 
territory covered. 
Sanitary inspectors have authority not only 
to compel the building and use of latrines, but 
also to require the people to cut down under- 
brush in interlot drains, correct faults in drain- 
age systems and thus prevent mosquito breed- 
ing in accumulations of stagnant water, screen 
all vats in which water for drinking and culinary 
purposes is stored, and make whatever other

improvements in sanitation are deemed neces- 
sary in order to ensure the health of the com- 
munity. It is usually possible to secure these 
changes by means of education and persuasion; 
but when these means prove ineffective, legal 
notice is served that the particular reform must 
be completed within a specified time. Failure 
to comply within that time is punishable by fine 
or imprisonment. 
In Dutch Guiana, shortly after the Colonial 
Ankylostomiasis Commission began its work 
for the relief and control of hookworm disease, 
the Government issued police regulations which 
defined all estates, plantations, and plots of 
ground as public lands, and then declared pol- 
lution of the soil thereon, or failure to keep the 
ground clean and clear of undergrowth, to be a 
nuisance punishable by fine or imprisonment. 
Longer terms of imprisonment and heavier fines 
are stipulated for defilmg any water supply, 
water course, or reservoir of water customarily 
used for drinking or washing purposes. 
In the course of the past year an act known 
as the Ankylostome Regulation, designed to 
support and further the work against hookworm 
disease, was drawn up. This act makes com- 
pulsory the construction of latrines of approved 
type at all habitable houses and at all public
-P-A-G-E-146
144 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
buildings such as schools and churches. Land- 
lords and proprietors (not tenants) are held 
responsible for the installation of latrines on 
their property, and provision is made for the 
appointment of one or more inspectors to see 
that the regulations are enforced. This act, 
which has been approved by the Netherlands 
Government, and which is to be made fully 
effective against hookworm disease through 
special decrees of the Colonial Governor, will 
greatly aid in bringing the disease under even- 
tual control. 
In. Nicaragua, during 1917, the National 
Congress enacted a law providing for house to 
house inspection, once a month, for the purpose 
of observing sanitary conditions. Local author- 
ities are vested with the power to compel the 
remedying of deficiencies in old latrines or, 
where necessary, the construction of new latrines 
which conform to models approved by the Supe- 
rior Board of Health. If a laboratory of the 
Department of Uncinariasis is operating in a 
town, the law provides that visits be made in 
company with the technical assistants con- 
nected with the laboratory, who thus become 
invested with the character of sanitary inspec- 
tors. The Governor of each department is 
charged with the enforcement of the decree.
-P-A-G-E-147
SOIL SANITATION AS A MEANS OF CONTROL 145 
In Guatemala, a presidential decree was issued 
during the year which makes obligatory the 
installation and proper maintenance of latrines. 
As a result many villages and plantations have 
introduced such sanitary measures as removing 
rain barrels and tin cans containing stagnant 
water, filling in or draining backyards and 
swampy areas, making filth and rubbish inac- 
cessible to fowls and animals, and either cor- 
recting defects in old latrines or constructing 
new ones. The crowding of thousands of people 
in the public parks, without toilet conveniences, 
following the earthquake of December 25, not 
only offered unlimited opportunities for the 
spread of disease but at the same time brought 
to the attention of Government and people as 
never before the pressing importance of latrines. 
SANITATION OF THE SOIL IN ADVANCE OF 
TREATMENT IN CEYLON 
More and more it is becoming possible to 
limit the curative work against hookworm 
disease to areas in which measures for the pre- 
vention of soil pollution have been carried out 
in advance. The reason for this is the increase 
in laws requiring the construction of latrines. 
It is strikingly true in Ceylon, where a wide- 
spread movement for the prevention of soil 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
   
   146 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
pollution is under way. In November, 1916, 
regulations requiring the installation of sufficient 
latrines on all estates within the period of one 
year were enacted. Thus, on the three areas in 
which work was inaugurated during the past 
year (Dickoya, Bogawantalawa, and Norwood), 
sufficient latrine accommodations had been pro- 
vided and were in use before the work of exami- 
nation and treatment began; while in the Matale 
area, where the work had been in progress since 
January, 1916, all but two of the 24 estates had 
been so provided. It was in the Matale area, 
during 1916, that on one estate the reexamina- 
tion of coolies who had been cured of hookworm 
disease showed such a high rate of reinfection 
as to convince both the Government authorities 
and the planters of the necessity for carrying 
out thorough-going measures for the safe disposal 
of excreta. This experience led to the passage 
of laws for the control of soil pollution. In 
Kalutara district, located in the Western Prov- 
ince, the villages are being sanitated and re- 
modeled, and on a recent visit it was found that 
more than 20,000 latrines had been installed 
during the year.

VI 
HOOKWORM DISEASE IN MINES 
An investigation of the literature of the sub- 
ject of hookworm disease in mines was made by 
the Board during the year. The following 
paragraphs suggest the conditions existing in a 
number of European countries. 
INFECTION IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 
In Italy, the disease has probably prevailed 
for centuries. In 1908 an infection rate of 38.2 
per cent. was found among 429 miners in two 
mines. In 1913 an infection rate of 57 per cent. 
was found among 23,063 workers in the sulphur 
mines of Sicily. 
In France, investigations were begun by the 
Government in 1904 which covered 82 per cent. 
of the 144,133 underground miners. The aver- 
age percentage of infection was found to be 4.6 
per cent. It will be recognized that this com- 
paratively low percentage is for a very large 
proportion of the total population of the coun- 
try, and not for a single selected area. Legisla- 
tion has been enacted which requires mine 
owners to meet hospital expenses for treatment, 
147 
   
-P-A-G-E-150
  148 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
In England, the problem is limited to tin 
mines, of which there are about 50. In the 
course of a limited investigation 127! men were 
examined; these disclosed an infection rate of 
66 per cent. 
In Belgium, the intensity of infection ranged 
from five per cent. to 92 percent. Out of a total 
of 27,153 underground miners in the Liege dis- 
trict, 3,590 were examined and of this number 
818, or 22.79 per cent., were found infected. Of 
the 72 pits in the district, 49 were infected. 
In the Netherlands, a survey of six mines made 
in 1904 showed 373 cases, or 25.05 per cent., 
among 1,489 miners. The degree of infection 
ranged from 15 per cent. to 67 per cent. Be- 
tween the years 1904 and 1914, 36,047 applicants 
for work in mines were examined and of this 
number 755 were found to be carriers. 
In Germany, 32,576, or 16.8 per cent., were 
found infected out of a total working force of 
194,127. The average rate of infection among 
12,600 men in six of the worse mines was 54.1 
per cent.; in one mine it was 84 per cent. Of 
the 234 mines subjected to examination, 113 
showed evidence of the presence of the disease. 
1 Unless otherwise stated the figures quoted are for the year 1903.
-P-A-G-E-151
  HOOKWORM DISEASE IN MINES 149 
In Hungary, only a small percentage of the 
total mining population has been investigated. 
Of the 61,092 underground miners employed, 
8,400 were examined, and the percentage of in- 
fection was found to be from 85 to 100. 
In Austria, the conditions are unfavorable to 
the spread of the disease. Up to September, 
1906, only 44 cases had been discovered, based 
on the examination of 7,517 miners working in 
519 mines. These 44 were located in 19 different 
mines. 
In Spain, the disease is probably more acute 
than in any other European country. The in- 
fection ranges from 50 per cent. to 95 per cent., 
and is heaviest in the lead mines of Linares. 
INFECTION IN THE UNITED STATES 
It is not Europe alone, however, that is inter- 
ested in the problem of hookworm disease in 
mines. The whole world is concerned, for, 
without a passport or by-your-leave, the infec- 
tion crosses all frontiers. It is, for example, 
being carried from Europe to the mines of the 
United States. A survey of the mines of 
California in 1916 revealed widespread hook- 
worm infection and led to the first systematic 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  150 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
campaign for the control of the disease in mines 
ever undertaken in this country. Although up 
to the present time no general survey has been 
made to determine the precise extent and dis- 
tribution of the infection, a number of cases of 
infected miners have been found in the mines of 
Nevada, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, 
and West Virginia. In all probability careful 
investigations would disclose the presence of 
cases in the mines of other states. 
CENTERS OF INFECTION 
In practically every country where the disease 
has secured a firm footing, some one mine, in 
which the prevailing conditions are particularly 
favorable, has usually become the center of 
extraordinarily heavy infection and has served 
as a relay station from which the disease has 
been passed forward into new areas. For in- 
stance, the seat of infection in Sicily was the 
mines of San Giovannello and San Giovannello 
Lo Bue in Lercara, where the degree of infection 
was 100 per cent. and 96 per cent., respectively; 
in Hungary it was the Brennberg mine, with an 
infection of 100 per cent.; in Germany the Graf 
Schwerin, infection 96 per cent.; in England the 
Dolcoath mine, infection 94 per cent.; in Belgium 
the Corbeau aux Berleur, infection 92 per cent.;

in Spain the Linares mines, infection 75 per 
cent.; in France the Beraudiere mine (St. Etienne 
basin), infection 73 per cent.; and in Holland the 
Neuprick, infection 67 per cent. 
MEASURES OF CONTROL 
The measures of contro] which have proved 
most effective are: (1) provision of underground 
latrines and stringent enforcement of their use; 
(2) location of infected miners by means of 
thorough microscopic examination of stools; (3) 
treatment of those found infected and dismissal 
of those who, after treatment, remain uncured; 
(4) refusal of employment to applicants unless, 
after careful microscopic examination, they are 
found to be free from infection; (5) periodical 
reexaminations of miners who are most likely 
to become exposed to reinfection, in order that 
new cases may be promptly located. 
RESULTS OF CONTROL MEASURES 
The employment of these several measures has 
resulted in a marked reduction in infection. 
Among the 194,127 miners examined in Germany 
in 1903, before the introduction of measures of 
control, 32,527 were found infected. In 1912, 
after these control measures had been in oper- 
ation for nearly a decade, only 497 carriers were 
found among 277,627 miners examined; a reduc- 
10 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
   
   154 ‘INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
tion from 16.8 per cent. to .18 per cent. In the 
Netherlands, the reduction of infection during 
the decade from 1903 to 1913 was from 25 per 
cent. to .82 per cent. In the Liege district of 
Belgium, the reduction of infection was from 
22.79 per cent. in 1902 to 1.2 per cent. in 1913. 
Germany, Holland, Belgium, and England are 
the only countries which have made any con- 
siderable effort to control hookworm infection 
in mines. 
PRELIMINARY WORK IN CHINA 
Realizing the importance of this phase of the 
work of hookworm control, the International 
Health Board has undertaken a demonstration 
in the control of the disease in the Pinghsiang 
Colliery, in the Kiangsi Province of China. 
The Board is working in cooperation with 
Government and mining interests. In this 
mine, the largest in the country, probably about 
11,916 miners are employed; 7,345, or 62 per 
cent., of whom are underground workers. The 
preliminary survey indicated a rate of infection 
of 85 percent. among these underground workers. 
The rate among workers on the surface was 
found to be 32 per cent. (See Fig. 25, page 155.) 
There are many opportunities for acquiring 
the infection. Not only are the miners’ feet bare, 
but their bodies are often naked, and in the low

places it is not uncommon for their entire un- 
covered bodies to come into contact with highly 
infected mud. (See Fig. 24, page 152.) The lack 
of latrine accommodations underground means 
that the excrement is deposited everywhere 
throughout the mines. The high temperature 
and extreme humidity make for the propaga- 
tion of hookworm larvae. Water trickling from 
the roofs and through the walls of the galleries 
keeps the interior moist. Sitting on the wet 
ground but once is said to result in symptoms of 
ground itch. Still other opportunities for ac- 
quiring the infection are afforded by the fact that 
water in the drains is often used for drinking and 
for washing. However, the custom among the 
Chinese of boiling their water and making it into 
tea before drinking it, reduces somewhat the dan- 
ger of infection. 
In carrying out measures of relief and control, 
the Board is undertaking to conduct the initial 
examination and treatment of the miners and to 
offer suggestions as to needed sanitary improve- 
ments. The mining authorities have contrib- 
uted 20,000 Mexican dollars to the work of 
control and are cooperating in the introduction 
of necessary sanitary measures. There is every 
probability that a permanent, sanitary depart- 
ment will be established after the Board has 
withdrawn its staff.     
-P-A-G-E-159
VII 
LOCAL SUPPORT OF THE WORK 
During the past four years, the Board has co- 
operated in the control of hookworm diséase in 
a dozen states of the Union and in more than'a 
score of foreign countries. Probably the out- 
standing, and certainly the most gratifying, fea- 
ture of the work during the past year has been 
the degree of financial responsibility assumed by 
these several communities and countries. Year 
by year, .as the work has progressed, an increas- 
ingly large proportion of the total expense in- 
volved has been borne by the Government, thus 
gradually preparing the way for the ultimate 
withdrawal of the Board. A few illustrations of 
this increasing measure of local support are here 
cited. 
THE WORK IN BRAZIL 
Brazil furnishes an excellent example. Less 
than two years ago, on invitation by the Govern-' 
ment of the State of Rio de Janeiro, the Board 
sent a representative to begin operations in 
that country, in cooperation with Government. 
First, an infection survey was made of the entire 
State of Rio de Janeiro. This survey, which was 
157 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
    158 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
finished in the month of March, showed the geo- 
graphical distribution and degree of infection, and 
the sanitary conditions which were responsible 
for its presence and spread. The finding of an 
average infection of nearly 90 per cent. among 
the inhabitants of the unsewered localities and 
countty districts of the State, and of approxi- 
mately 80 per cent. among the entire population 
of the State, provoked serious interest in the 
problem. The survey was followed by a demon- 
stration, in a selected area, of work for the relief 
and control of the disease. 
When this first unit began operations on May 
1, 1917, the occasion was marked by appropriate 
ceremonies in Rio Bonita. Cordial felicitations 
were received from the National Academy of 
Medicine, from the President of the Oswaldo 
Cruz Institute, and from the President of the 
State. The previous day, April 30, the President 
had signed a decree which established a Service 
for the prevention of hookworm disease as a part 
of the Department of Hygiene and Public Health. 
The Board’s Director in Brazil was appointed 
Chief of that Service. The Legislative Assembly, 
by unanimous vote, has enacted a sanitary ordi- 
nance requiring the installation of latrines and 
has begun the organization of a permanent sani- 
tary staff. Funds for this first demonstration 
were supplied by the Board. Before the demon-

stration had been completed, work in another 
area was requested on the basis that the funds be 
supplied one-fourth by the state, one-fourth by 
the local government, one-fourth by the estate 
owners (sugar planters), and one-fourth by the 
Board. This proposition was accepted. 
The Federal authorities, having already ascer- 
tained the prevalence of infection in the Federal 
District, asked that a demonstration be under- 
taken in a selected area within the District, and 
proposed to supply in funds and personnel one- 
half the cost. The area selected is the Ilha do 
Governador, an island in the Bay of Rio de 
Janeiro. It was selected because it is econom- 
ically important, because its well-defined natural 
boundaries and its fixed population afford excel- 
lent opportunity for an effective demonstration 
to be made, and because its proximity to the 
national capital (45 minutes by ferry) makes it 
extremely easy for interested Federal and State 
officials to watch the progress of the work. Up 
to the close of the year, 3,762 persons had been 
examined, of whom 2,537, or 67.4 per cent., were 
found infected. 
The Federal Health Service supplied a physi- 
cian to assist the Director for Brazil in carrying 
out this demonstration, with a view to his be- 
coming well-trained in the work. The Govern- 
ment is also furnishing a staff of 11 nurses, is

printing the necessary forms, and is providing a 
house for the laboratory, sleeping quarters for 
the staff, and free transportation for the material 
used in the work. The Board is called upon to 
provide only the medicines and the staff of three 
microscopists needed to examine specimens. Be- 
fore the work in this area had been completed, 
Government provided funds for the simultane- 
ous operation of five additional units under its 
own direction. The staff which is being organ- 
ized and trained in the work is a part of the per- 
manent Government sanitary organization de- 
signed for the control of hookworm disease and 
other diseases throughout the Federal District. 
Following the demonstration in Rio de Janeiro, 
the State of Sao Paulo also invited cooperation 
in carrying out an infection survey and demon- 
stration, Government offering to pay one-half of 
the expense from the beginning. Active opera- 
tions were begun in the month of November in 
the town of Iguape, the county seat of a muni- 
cipio situated on the sea coast, in which con- 
ditions are very favorable for the spread of 
hookworm disease. Up to the end of the year, 
400 persons had been examined, of which number 
394, or 98.5 per cent., were found infected. To- 
wards the close of the year, the Director of the 
Public Health Service arranged with the Board 
to organize another unit for this State, agreeing

to pay two-thirds of the necessary expenses. In 
addition to this, the State has undertaken to build 
up a permanent sanitary organization and to 
sanitate all areas in advance of examination and 
treatment. Figure 30, page 166, indicates graph- 
ically the increased proportion of the expense 
being borne by local agencies in the State of Sao 
Paulo (Brazil), in Ceylon, and in North Carolina. 
COOPERATION IN CEYLON 
One-half the necessary funds for carrying on 
the work in Ceylon are supplied by the Govern- 
ment. It has, moreover, undertaken the task of 
organizing, training, and maintaining a perma- 
nent sanitary staff charged with the duty of pro- 
viding measures against soil pollution, in all 
areas, in advance of the examination and treat- 
ment of the people. It is providing also for the 
training of medical officers, who will be prepared 
to carry the work forward after the Board with- 
draws. The people are instructed as to the seri- 
ousness of hookworm disease and as to the gains 
to be derived from primary sanitation. Villages 
in which lectures, or lantern demonstrations, on 
hookworm disease are held often elect a health 
committee at the close of the meeting and en- 
trust this committee with the task of persuading 
the people to provide themselves with latrines

and, in other ways, to improve health conditions. 
For example, in the district of Panadura, one of 
the influential Singhalese has joined the local 
committee and is assisting in the work among the 
poor: among other things he is planning to open 
a dispensary for the treatment of hookworm dis- 
ease. Such results as these are particularly grat- 
ifying when it is remembered that the villages of 
Ceylon, with their mixed population, class dis- 
tinctions, and religious prejudices, have long con- 
stituted one of the most perplexing problems in 
connection with the work. 
The realization by estate owners of the benefits 
to be derived from the treatment of their laborers, 
has facilitated the work of control ontheseestates. 
Planters agree in advance to give active support 
to the undertakings. They provide, at reason- 
able cost, an adequate place as quarters, with 
an office for the director, accommodations for 
the laboratory and office staff; and board and 
lodging on each estate for one or two dispensers. 
They also assist in taking the census and in as- 
sembling the laboring force for treatment on 
specified days. In nearly all cases the planters 
also provide help for the dispensers, an assembly 
ground protected from rain and sun where the 
laborers can be kept during treatment, and an 
allowance of rice to be used in preparing “konje”’ 
for distribution before and after treatment.

SUPPORT IN SOUTHERN STATES 
When the work was originally begun in the 
South, under the direction of the Rockefeller 
Sanitary Commission, the total expense was 
borne by the Commission. As the work has 
progressed, the states, counties, and local com- 
munities have assumed an increasing share of 
the necessary cost. This change is indicated by 
the fact that 20 counties have each appropriated 
a total of from $3,000 to $4,000, and 32 counties 
from ten to 25 cents per capita, for one year’s 
work against soil-pollution diseases: It is even 
more clearly indicated by the fact that, for the 
work outlined for the Southern States during 
1918, the states and counties are to pay at least 
two-thirds of the total expense and the Board 
not more than one-third. Under the three-year 
program outlined for North Carolina, the Board 
is to provide not more than 25 per cent. of the 
necessary funds for the first year’s work, 20 per 
cent. for the second year’s work, and twelve and 
one-half per cent. for the third year’s work. 
INCREASE IN STATE HEALTH FUNDS 
There is no better barometer of the interest 
in public health work than appropriations. That 
public opinion, in the Southern States, is today

the increase in funds placed at the disposal of 
health departments by the legislatures of 11 
states? during the period from 1910 to 1918, 
inclusive. The increased appropriations have 
enabled health departments to enlarge their 
personnel and multiply their activities. The 
amount available for health work in North Caro- 
lina in 1910 was $18,200, while in 1918 it will be 
$144,000. The amount available in South Caro-

1918. Reference to the chart will show that the 
total resources available for the health boards of 
these 11 States in 1910 were only $255,395 as 
compared with $1,416,111 in 1918—an increase

TUBERCULOSIS IN FRANCE 
One of the unfortunate. results of war condi- 
tions has been a marked increase in tuberculosis 
in a number of the belligerent countries. There 
are many indications that this has occurred, par- 
ticularly in Belgium, Hungary, Italy, and France. 
Early in 1917 the Rockefeller Foundation, acting 
in response to a recommendation by its War Re- 
lief Commission and on assurance from the 
French Government that the undertaking would 
be welcomed, engaged Dr. Hermann M: Biggs, 
Commissioner of Health for the State of New 
York, to go to France and make a study of the 
situation in that country. On being advised by 
Dr. Biggs that the situation was menacing and 
that the French authorities, who were already 
taking steps to combat the disease, would wel- 
come American aid, the Foundation, acting 
through the International Health Board, offered 
its cooperation to the French Government. On 
receiving assurances that assistance would be 
acceptable, the Board appointed a Commission 
for the Prevention of Tuberculosis in France 
with Dr. Livingston Farrand, President of the 
University of Colorado and formerly Secretary 
n 173
-P-A-G-E-176
  174 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
of the American Association for the Study and 
Prevention of Tuberculosis, as its Director. The 
Commission arrived in Paris in July, made a 
survey of the field, established working relations 
with Government and existing agencies, and 
began active operations in September. 
The policy of the Commission was clearly ex- 
pressed by the Director when, in response to 
President Poincaré’s warm words of welcome 
he said, “‘We are not here to give you ‘este 
tion, but to fight with you against a common 
enemy.” It is recognized that tuberculosis in 
France can be brought under control only by 
French agencies rooted in the life and traditions 
of the people and working over long periods of 
time. The Commission, therefore, while taking 
over a few American workers for temporary serv- 
ice, has sought from the beginning to work with 
existing agencies in organizing plans of opera- 
tion and to enlist the services of French physi- 
cians and French visiting nurses in the work. 
These efforts are meeting with cordial response. 
As part of a comprehensive plan of operation 
designed to cover the country, the Commission 
is centering its efforts on conducting a statistical 
survey with a view to defining the problem ten- 
tatively and laying the basis for a central regis- 
try for future guidance in the work; on establish- 
ing systems of tuberculosis dispensaries; on   
   
-P-A-G-E-177
TUBERCULOSIS IN FRANCE 175 
training visiting nurses for service in these dis- 
-pensaries; and on carrying out a campaign of 
popular education. 
TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY SERVICE 
The antituberculosis dispensary, with all its 
adjuncts, is the essential feature of an equip- 
ment for fighting tuberculosis and for this reason 
the Commission has made this the starting point 
in its work. After inspecting a number of ad- 
mirable French dispensaries already in operation, 
and conferring with the authorities, it was agreed 
that in order to have the necessary freedom in 
testing the application of American methods to 
French conditions, the Commission should have 
a number of dispensaries under its own adminis- 
tration. To this end, it selected the 19th Arron- 
dissement of Paris and the Department of Eure 
et Loire, as representing urban and provincial 
conditions, the purpose being to operate in each 
of these, as a demonstration center, a complete 
system of dispensaries with modern equipment 
and trained personnel. The work in these cen- 
ters, while under American supervision, is. being 
conducted in intimate association with local gov- 
ernment and volunteer agencies. In the De- 
partment of Eure et Loire, for example, dispen- 
saries are in operation at Chartres, Dreux,
-P-A-G-E-178
176 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
Chateaudun, and arrangements have been made 
to open a fourth at Nogent-le-Rotrou, all under 
French auspices, but supplemented in equipment 
and personnel by the Commission. 
From these four centers it is planned, by sup- 
plementing local effort in similar manner, to 
reach out as rapidly as conditions permit into 
the surrounding rural districts. While develop- 
ing these two centers—designed as testing lab- 
oratories in their earlier stages, and as demon- 
strations and training grounds when more fully 
developed—the Commission is making a de- 
tailed survey of France with a view to simulta- 
neous cooperation with local authorities in other 
parts of the country. At the end of the year, 
cooperative relations had been definitely ef- 
fected or planned in Blois, Tours, Augers, Le 
Mans, Saint Nazaire, Quimper, Chalons-sur- 
Marne, Troyes, Lyons, Saint Etienne, Macon, 
and Bordeaux. 
This effort to aid France in establishing a sys- 
tem of antituberculosis dispensaries cannot be 
understood without taking into consideration the 
complete cooperation of the American Red 
Cross. The control of tuberculosis is insepara- 
ble Bes other aspects of public health work and 
is related with peculiar intimacy to child wel- 
fare. The Children’s Bureau of the American 
Red Cross has undertaken a campaign for the

promotion of child hygiene and is conducting all 
its work in cooperation with the Commission for 
the Prevention of Tuberculosis; children’s dis- 
pensaries and tuberculosis dispensaries are being 
housed in the same buildings and are supple- 
menting each other in equipment, in personnel, 
and in work. The Red Cross is providing funds 
for the children’s work; is supplementing the 
efforts of local relief agencies, and is aiding in 
establishing sanatoria to which the dispensaries 
may send patients needing such care. 
VISITING NURSING 
If the fight against tuberculosis centers in an 
efficient dispensary service, the dispensary cen- 
ters in the work of the visiting nurse, or, to bor- 
row the Commission’s better phrase, the visiteuse 
@hygiene. It is taken for granted that the dis- 
pensary will be equipped for diagnostic and 
medical care of patients, but it is mainly through 
its staff of visiteuses d’hygiéne that it will reach the 
homes, discover the incipient cases, and in time 
effect such reform in individual hygiene and in 
family and community conditions of living as to 
limit or prevent the spread of the infection. It 
was clear that the opening of dispensaries would 
rapidly multiply the demand for trained French 
women, of the right type, to do this work.
-P-A-G-E-182
180 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
To meet this situation, a working arrangement 
was entered into with the three leading centers 
for the training of visiting nurses in Paris, a 
standard course of training was agreed upon, 
stipends were provided for student-nurses of ap- 
proved qualifications, and opportunity was pro- 
vided in connection with the dispensary service 
in the 19th Arrondissement for practical experi- 
ence under competent supervision in the daily 
rounds of the service. Also in connection with 
this dispensary service, graduates who have had 
the regular course for hospital nursing are being 
trained in the visiting and social service sides of 
the work. The Director of this division speaks 
with enthusiasm of the type of French women 
who are entering this service and of the way in 
which they are measuring up to its requirements. 
At the close of the year there were 60 under- 
graduate, and ten graduate nurses taking the 
course, with the demand for trained workers out- 
running the supply. 
CAMPAIGN OF EDUCATION 
An effective program for the prevention of dis- 
ease must be fundamentally educational. The 
dispensaries, with their visiting nurses, are, as a 
matter of fact, educational agencies, each doing 
permanent and intensive work in its own com-

This educational work of the. dispen- 
is, however, being supplemented by a cam- 
,o of popular instruction designed to cover 
_. whole country and to educate the people en 
masse. Its central feature is the traveling ex- 
hibit mounted on motor trucks. Each car car- 
ries a motor-generator to produce the current for 
the moving pictures; a moving picture machine 
with films, slides, and screens; a complete exhibit 
of 42 panels, and a full supply of printed matter. 
Each carries a mechanic-driver and a demon- 
strator, and is preceded by a courier who makes 
the necessary local arrangements for demonstra- 
tions, lectures, and publicity. 
By the end of the year the Commission had 
one traveling exhibit in operation, with a second 
car ready and two others in preparation; and 
had developed an extremely effective body of 
literature for schools, for the press, and for gen- 
eral distribution. The Children’s Bureau of the 
American Red Cross is also represented in these 
traveling exhibits. The reception accorded these 
exhibits, by public officials and by the people, 
has been stirring in its patriotic fervor; the re- 
sponse to the spirit in which American coopera- 
tion is offered has been both generous and 
enthusiastic.

MALARIA CONTROL 
Malaria, like hookworm disease, is prevalent 
over a large portion of the globe. These two in- 
fections constitute what is probably the most 
serious obstacle to the development of civiliza- 
tion in the regions where they prevail. For the 
past few years the International Health Board 
has cooperated with Government in the carry- 
ing out of measures for the control of intestinal 
parasites in the infected states of our own coun- 
try and in a number of foreign countries. Re- 
cently, with a view to stimulating more energetic 
measures against malaria, it has interested itself 
in the problem of malaria control. It has not 
attempted to put into operation a finished anti- 
malaria program, but rather to test working 
methods and to evaluate, separately, a number 
of control measures. 
CONTROL BY STERILIZATION OF CARRIERS 
Specifically, three control measures have each 
been given one trial at three different places and 
a fourth measure in two separate communities. 
In cooperation with the Mississippi State De- 
184
-P-A-G-E-187
  MALARIA CONTROL 185 
partment of Health, and under the scientific 
direction of Dr. C. C. Bass of Tulane Medical 
School, an experiment was undertaken in 1916 to 
test the feasibility of controlling malaria in a 
community by sterilizing the human carriers. 
The experiment has been carried out in a rural 
delta community, in Bolivar County, Mississippi, 
where the extermination of mosquitoes under 
present conditions is not regarded as practicable. 
Something more than 25,000 people have been 
handled in the test. Similar work is being done 
on a smaller scale, in Sunflower County, as a 
check, while the results of the test in Bolivar 
County are being analyzed. In the meantime, 
no conclusions are attempted beyond the general 
indication, which seems apparent enough, that _ 
the malaria rate in a given community can be 
reduced by direct attack on the malaria plas- 
modia in the blood of the human host. 
CONTROL BY{{SCREENING 
The remaining tests were conducted in the 
State of Arkansas in cooperation with the United 
States Public Health Service and the Arkansas 
State Department of Health. In a rural com- 
munity near Lake Village, effort was made to test 
the control of malaria by screening. Every oc- 
cupied house in the community was screened 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
186 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
with galvanized wire cloth, 16 mesh, and the 
people were taught not only the importance of 
keeping the screens in good condition but also 
the danger of exposure to mosquitoes on the out- 
side after dark. Each home was inspected at 
regular intervals throughout the season. No 
other measure was employed. A parasite index, 
taken in May, 1916, when the work began, 
showed an infection of 11.97 per cent.; a second 
parasite index, taken in December of the same 
year, showed an infection of 3.52 per cent., a 
reduction of 70.6 per cent. The third index, 
which it was designed to have taken in May, 
1917, and which would have offered a more in- 
structive comparison, was omitted for lack of 
time. In the autumn of the year, the screens in 
all the homes were found to be in good repair, 
and the people—mainly typical plantation ne- 
groes—were thoroughly convinced of their value. 
The average cost of screening in this community 
was $14.59 per house. Estimating the life of the 
screen at two years, the average annual cost of 
screening would be $7.29. The per capita cost 
on this basis was $1.75. 
CONTROL BY PROPHYLACTIC QUININE 
In another rural community near Lake Village, 
prophylactic quinine was tried as the sole meas-

ure of control. Under the direct supervision of 
the physician in charge, it was administered to 
all persons in the community in doses of five 
grains, morning and evening, making ten grains 
a day for two successive days each week. For 
children under 15 years of age, the dosage was 
reckoned at one grain for each three years and 
administered in the same way. A parasite index, 
taken in May, 1916, when the work began, and 
again in December of the same year, showed a 
reduction of 64.45 per cent. Again one must 
regret the omission of the index for May, 1917. 
The per capita cost of the work, omitting the 
overhead, was 57 cents. 
CONTROL BY ANTIMOSQUITO MEASURES 
At Crossett, Arkansas, a lumber town of 2,029 
inhabitants, an attempt has been made to test 
the feasibility of controlling malaria in a small 
community by resort to such antimosquito 
measures as would be within the limits of ex- 
penditure which such a community might well 
afford. The work was begun in April, 1916. 
Effort was directed toward the elimination or 
control of the breeding-places of mosquitoes, and 
that without major drainage. Borrow pits and 
shallow ponds were filled or drained; streams 
were cleared of undergrowth when this was nec-
-P-A-G-E-192
190 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
essary to let the sunlight in; accumulations of 
débris were removed from the beds; and they 
were so regraded as to provide an unobstructed 
off-flow through a narrow channel. The one 
large pond which could not be drained was 
treated by removing vegetation and other ob- 
structions from the edges so as to give the fish 
free access to all possible breeding-places. Arti- 
ficial containers were removed or treated. All 
remaining breeding-places were sprayed once a 
week with road oil by means of either artificial 
drips or knapsack sprayers. No other measures 
were employed. 
The results are graphically exhibited by Fig. 41, 
page 191. The reduction in malaria, as shown by 
a parasite index taken in May, 1916, and again in 
December of the same year, was 72.33 per cent. 
The reduction in physicians’ calls for malaria 
(Company’s records) in 1916, as compared with 
the number of calls for the previous year, was 
70.36 per cent. Or, if the comparison be limited 
to the period June to December, when the work 
had become effective, the reduction in physi- 
cians’ calls for malaria was 81.6 per cent. 
At the end of the year the community took 
over the work and assumed its expense as well 
as its direction. The chart indicates the net 
- result of community effort for 1917. The Com- 
pany record shows that most of the malaria calls

for the year were among laborers newly recruited 
from the outside. With these importations there 
were only 200 physicians’ calls for malaria in 
1917 as compared with 2,500 calls for 1915, the 
year before the work began,—a reduction for the 
two-year period of approximately 92 per cent. 
The per capita cost of the work for 1916, 
omitting overhead, was $1.24; for 1917, still 
omitting the overhead, which has been negligible, 
it was $.63. At $2.00 per physician’s call this 
community has been paying, annually, almost 
four times as much in doctors’ bills alone for the 
privilege of having malaria as it has expended 
during the current year to be practically free 
from malaria and from the mosquito as a pest. 
At Hamburg, Arkansas, the county seat of 
Ashley County, similar measures were under- 
taken after the work at Crossett was taken over 
by the community. A preliminary survey made 
at the height of the previous malaria season, had 
revealed a high malaria rate, with anopheles 
breeding profusely in ponds and streams through- 
out the municipal area. Figure 42, page 193, 
shows the large number and wide distribution of 
breeding-places. The measures which had been 
carried out at Crossett the previous year were 
repeated here and with similar results. A ma-

Physicians’ calls for malaria reported monthly 
for 1917, as compared with the number of calls 
estimated from physicians’ records for the pre- 
vious year, showed a reduction of 88.75 per cent. 
The community bore about one-third the cost of 
the work and at the end of the year.took it over, 
assuming entire responsibility for its continu- 
ance. The results and cost of the work may be

in which each of these several measures will be 
given its proper place. A plan of operation to 
be practicable must fall within limits of cost 
which the average community can afford. Under 
conditions where, for example, the cost of mos- 
quito extermination is prohibitive, resort must be 
had to less expensive measures. With definite 
understanding of the possibilities and costs of 
the several lines of procedure, the director of the 
work will be in position to adapt means to ends 
with complete freedom and with a view to great-

ERADICATION OF YELLOW FEVER 
Since Reed’s discovery that yellow fever is 
conveyed by the Stegomyia mosquito, now 
known as Aedes Calopus, the complete eradica- 
tion of the disease has become largely a matter 
of local sanitation. Sanitarians are agreed that 
to accomplish this result it is necessary only to 
control the breeding-places of mosquitoes in the 
endemic centers of the infection. In order to 
locate these endemic foci, and to ascertain the 
practicability of undertaking measures for the 
eradication of the infection, the Board, in 1916, 
appointed a Yellow Fever Commission, with 
General Gorgas as its head. The Commission 
visited the regions of South America in which 
yellow fever has been reported or suspected in 
recent years and submitted a report of its find- 
ings. Owing to war conditions, it became neces- 
sary to suspend the operations which had been 
outlined and authorized for the year 1917. 
During the past year outbreaks of yellow fever 
along the coast of the Caribbean Sea were re- 
ported. Dr. Juan Guiteras, a member of the 
Commission, investigated these reports. He 
visited the French Colony, Martinique, and 
198

Maracaibo and Caracas in Venezuela, but found 
no authentic cases of the disease at these places. 
During the latter part of July, he found eight 
authentic cases at Coro, the capital of the State 
of Falcon. These cases were reported to the 
Venezuelan Government, with the result that 
steps were at once taken to eradicate the infec- 
tion not only from Coro but from the entire 
State of Falcon.

PUBLIC HEALTH TRAINING IN 
BRAZIL 
Following the report of a special commission 
sent to Brazil in 1916 to study medical condi- 
tions, the Board entered into an arrangement 
with the Faculdade de Medicina e Cirurgia at 
Sao Paulo for the establishment of a Department 
of Hygiene in that institution. The new De- 
partment—the first of its kind in Brazil—is to 
be maintained jointly by the Medical School and 
the Board for a period of five years, with the 
understanding that if at the end of that time it 
has justified itself, Government will assume its 
support. Dr. S. T. Darling, who served with 
General Gorgas on the Canal Zone, and Dr. 
W. G. Smillie, of the Harvard School of Public 
Health and the Rockefeller Institute, have been 
appointed Director and Assistant Director, re- 
spectively, to have charge of the work during its 
initial stages. ' 
Meantime, the Board is providing for the train- 
ing of two Brazilian physicians in the Hopkins 
School of Hygiene and Public Health. It is 
expected that upon completion of their studies 
they will return to Brazil and serve in the De-

partment of Hygiene at Sao Paulo. The Medi- 
cal School has provided adequate quarters for 
the new Department (See Figs. 47 and 48, page 
201) and has arranged to inaugurate the work 
in March, 1918. It is expected that the De- 
partment will, from the beginning, undertake, in 
a modest way, both the cultivation of hygiene as 
a science and the training of men for the appli- 
cation of its principles in the control of disease.

HOSPITAL SHIP IN THE SULU 
ARCHIPELAGO 
The medical work carried on through hospi- 
tals and dispensaries on the island of Mindanao 
(the Philippines), proved to be so successful that 
the extension of similar benefits to the outlying 
islands of the Sulu Sea appeared highly desira- 
ble. The International Health Board, therefore, 
entered into an agreement with the Government 
- of the Philippine Islands to equip a hospital ship 
for the purpose of demonstrating the value of a 
mobile dispensary service operating from a base 
hospital. It was further agreed that the Board 
would contribute towards the expense of its 
maintenance for a period of five years. 
The ship, which went into commission No- 
vember 12, 1917, is of about 300 tons and is 
provided with an internal combustion engine, 
which reduces costs for a vessel making fre- 
quent stops. It is equipped with a modern 
operating room, ward for ten beds, pharmacy, 
and quarters suitable for life on the tropic seas 
(See Figs. 50 and 51, page 144). It carries, be- 
sides the crew, a medical personnel consisting of 
the doctor in charge, an assistant, a chief nurse, 
204
-P-A-G-E-207
  HOSPITAL SHIP IN THE SULU ARCHIPELAGO 205 
and four other nurses. The plan is for the ship 
to make port at night and cruise during the day 
among the islands of the Sulu Archipelago, es- 
tablishing relations with its inhabitants. Dis- 
pensary work will be done largely on shore. 
Lesser operations will be performed on the ship, 
and more serious cases will be taken to one of 
the base hospitals, either at Jolo or Zamboanga.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT

-P-A-G-E-216
  FINANCIAL STATEMENT 
The statement on the following pages shows 
that in the work of the International Health 
Board during the year 1917, a total of $588,- 
158.19 was expended. This statement is based _ 
on expenditures actually made during the calen- 
dar year, 1917, regardless of when financial re- 
ports were received at the New York office. It 
will be seen that the figures differ from those given 
in the Treasurer’s statement on pages 281 to 344. 
The Treasurer’s Report includes amounts paid in 
the field during the first three quarters of 1917, 
to which in many instances have been added 
amounts paid during the fourth quarter of 1916, 
but not recorded until early in 1917. This dis- 
crepancy between the two reports is caused by 
the necessity of closing the Treasurer’s books 
shortly after the first of the calendar year, before 
detailed financial reports can be received from 
the foreign countries in which a large part of the 
work of the Board is conducted.

WORK OF THE YEAR 
The China Medical Board has continued dur- 
ing the year 1917 to carry out its program of 
assistance in the development of a comprehen- 
sive and adequate system of medicine in China. 
Substantial progress has been made in organiz- 
ing the faculty and in constructing the buildings 
of the Peking Union Medical College, one of the 
two centers of modern medical education which 
it is planned to establish in China. At the same 
time the Board has continued its assistance to 
existing medical schools and hospitals in that 
country and has continued to make possible, by 
fellowships and scholarships, advanced medical 
study in America by medical missionaries and 
Chinese physicians and nurses.

I. THE PEKING UNION MEDICAL 
COLLEGE 
The outstanding feature of the year has been 
the progress in the creation of the medical center 
in Peking. On September 24, 1917, the corner- 
stone of the new buildings was laid. The cere- 
mony was performed by the Chinese Minister of 
Education, Mr. Fan Yuan-lien, and addresses 
were made by Lieut.-Col. Frank Billings, M.D., 
of Chicago, by His Excellency Dr. Paul S. 
Reinsch, the American Minister to China, and 
by Dr. Franklin C. McLean, the Director of the 
school. (See Figure 52, page 226.) The con- 
struction of this large group of laboratories, 
lecture and demonstration rooms, hospital wards, 
service buildings and staff residences is pro- 
gressing rapidly. While the buildings will em- 
body all the approved features of a modern 
medical center, the external forms have been 
planned in harmony with the best tradition of 
Chinese architecture. They thus symbolize the 
purpose to make the College not something 
foreign to China’s best ideals and aspirations, 
but an organism which will become a part of a 
developing Chinese civilization. 
The group will include separate buildings for 
pathology and bacteriology, pharmacology and

physiological chemistry, a hospital with medical 
and surgical departments and a nurses’ training 
school, an outpatient department, an adminis- 
tration building, a building for religious and 
social meetings and recreation, and dormitories 
for students. On land near but not adjoining 
the campus, two groups of houses will be built 
for the use of the members of the teaching staff. 
The building up of the faculty for the school 
has been proceeding throughout the year. Dr. 
Franklin C. McLean, who in 1916 was appointed 
Director, has selected and recommended to the 
Board a number of well qualified men who form 
the nucleus of a strong teaching staff. An 
announcement of the purposes and plans of the 
Peking Medical School has been authorized and 
will appear in the near future.

PRE-MEDICAL SCHOOL AT PEKING 
In September, 1917, the Pre-Medical School 
was opened, housed in the remodeled buildings 
of the former Union Medical College. These 
buildings, which have been altered and thor- 
oughly equipped for their present use, are 
situated near the new Medical School group. 
The purpose of the school is to prepare for 
the courses in the Medical College. Students 
are admitted on examination after graduation 
from a middle school. As all instruction in the 
Pre-Medical School, with the exception of that 
in Chinese composition and literature, is in 
English, only those students who can read, 
write, and speak English are admitted. A three- 
year course in English, Chinese, German, mathe- 
matics, physics, chemistry, and biology is offered. 
On the successful completion of this course, stu- 
dents will receive certificates which entitle them 
to admission to the Peking Union Medical Col- 
lege without further examination. The courses 
offered in the Pre-Medical School are of college
-P-A-G-E-233
  PRE-MEDICAL SCHOOL 231 
grade. Students who have completed, else- 
where, one or more years of college work after 
graduation from a middle school, may be ad- 
mitted to advanced standing in the Pre-Medical 
School, and the course of study required for ad- 
mission to the Medical College will be corre- 
spondingly shortened. Eight students were en- 
rolled at the opening of the Pre-Medical School. 
By the time they are prepared for entrance, the 
Medical College will have opened its doors. 
FACULTY OF THE PRE-MEDICAL SCHOOL

Ii. THE SHANGHAI MEDICAL SCHOOL 
Progress has also been made during the year in 
plans for the organization of the second medical 
center, that at Shanghai. On April 12, 1917, 
the Trustees of this School were incorporated 
under a provisional charter granted by the 
University of the State of New York under the 
corporate name “Shanghai Medical School of 
the Rockefeller Foundation.” The following 
persons are the incorporating trustees: Fletcher 
S. Brockman, Wallace Buttrick, Walter B. Can- 
non, M.D., Simon Flexner, M.D., Frederick L. 
Gates, M.D., Starr J. Murphy, Francis W. Pea- 
body, M.D., Robert E. Speer, George E. Vin- 
cent, William H. Welch, M.D., and John W. 
Wood. 
A meeting of the Trustees was. held on May 
18, when the charter was accepted and by-laws 
adopted. George E. Vincent was elected Chair- 
man, John W. Wood, Vice-Chairman, and Wal- 
lace Buttrick, Secretary. Dr. Henry,S. Hough- 
ton was appointed Acting Dean. 
Plans for the buildings in Shanghai have been 
under consideration, but it is not expected that 
actual operations will be begun, or that definite 
steps will be taken toward securing a faculty, 
until the close of the war.

  234 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
The question of the preparation of students 
who may wish to enter the Shanghai Medical 
School has been considered at length. The 
Board has decided not to establish its own pre- 
paratory school, as in Peking, but to cooperate 
with selected colleges and universities in the 
vicinity in strengthening their work in science 
and other pre-medical subjects. In reaching this 
decision, the Board has been influenced by the 
fact that there are in the general field of the 
Shanghai School, anxious to cooperate in this 
work, colleges whose standards of work are high. 
To this end, appropriations have been made 
to enlarge the science department and to pro- 
vide additional instructors at the Fukien Chris- 
tian University situated at Foochow, Fukien 
Province, about 300 miles south of Shanghai, 
and connected with it by direct steamship 
service. The officers were authorized also to 
negotiate with the St. John’s University of 
Shanghai with a view to aiding its scientific 
department. Appropriations may be made later 
to other institutions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
  Il. AID TO EXISTING MEDICAL 
SCHOOLS IN CHINA 
It is expected that the chief contributions of 
the China Medical Board to medicine in China 
will be rendered through the large, modern 
centers being established at Peking and Shang- 
hai. However, the Board has also been giving 
aid to medical education by contributions to 
existing medical schools of high standard and of 
strategic importance. Such support was con- 
tinued during the year to the Hunan-Yale 
Medical School, Changsha, to the Tsinanfu 
Union Medical College, and to St. John’s Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania Medical School in 
Shanghai. ‘ 
To the Hunan-Yale School, an institution 
situated in Central China supported jointly by 
Yale alumni and the government of Hunan 
Province, the Board has contributed since 1915. 
During the year 1917 two new appropriations 
were made to this school: the sum of $9,000 
toward a total of $16,125 for an extension of 
the school budget, and the sum of $6,200 toward 
the support of instruction in the Pre-Medical 
Department. These appropriations each cover 
three years and are to be paid in annually de- 
creasing amounts, 
235
-P-A-G-E-238
236 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
The medical work at St. John’s University in 
Shanghai will be discontinued when the Shanghai 
Medical School is opened. Meanwhile, the 
China Medical Board is continuing to aid the 
University by contributing the salary of the 
instructor in anatomy. 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
IV. SUPPORT OF MISSIONARY 
HOSPITALS 
The Board has continued during the year to 
aid important missionary hospitals by making 
it possible for them to increase their medical 
staffs and to improve their equipment and 
plant. Contributions by the Board to mission- 
ary hospitals are conditioned upon the provid- 
ing, by the supporting societies, of at least one- 
fourth of the total sum desired for increase of 
staff, equipment, or plant. 
Grants have been made to the following mis- 
sionary hospitals, the details of which will be 
found in the Treasurer’s Report (See pages 281 
to 344):

  238 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Most of these hospitals had previously re- 
ceived appropriations from the Board. In some 
cases these appropriations are additional to the 
original grants; in other cases they are for new 
undertakings in connection with the same hos- 
pitals. This is in accordance with the Board’s 
policy of strengthening hospitals which are 
already doing excellent work, with the idea that 
graduates of the future medical schools may 
serve their internships at these hospitals. Pay- 
ments have not yet been called for on all these 
appropriations, for the missionary societies can- 
not always secure the personnel desired, espe- 
cially at the present time on account of the war.
-P-A-G-E-241
V. FELLOWSHIPS AND SCHOLARSHIPS 
Thirty-one medical missionaries on furlough 
.and 12 Chinese doctors have been studying in 
the United States during the past year on 
scholarships or fellowships supplied by the 
China Medical Board. Seven of the medical 
missionaries have studied at the Harvard Medi- 
cal School, three at the Johns Hopkins Medical 
School, three at the University of Pennsylvania, 
three at the Mayo Clinic, three at the New York 
Post-Graduate Hospital, two at the Rush Medi- 
cal School, and two at the Cook County Hospital 
in Chicago. Also one fellowship holder for either 
part-time or full-time has been at each of the 
following institutions: Columbia University, 
McGill University, Philadelphia Women’s Medi- 
cal College, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, 
Philadelphia Polyclinic Hospital, Massachusetts 
General Hospital, Massachusetts Charitable Eye 
and Ear Infirmary, Boston Lying-In Hospital,

Seven of the former students of the Harvard 
Medical School of China are completing their 
medical education in the United States at the 
expense of the China Medical Board, one of 
whom is working at the Johns Hopkins and the 
rest at the Harvard Medical School in Boston.

studying at the University of Maryland, were 
granted extensions of their scholarships. 
Miss Elizabeth Sze and Miss Lillian Wu are 
continuing their nursing training at the Johns 
Hopkins Hospital, and Miss Winifred Mooney 
of the Red Cross General Hospital, Shanghai, is 
about to take up work at the Massachusetts 
General Hospital. Appropriations have been 
made for two other Chinese nurses from the Red 
Cross General Hospital to come to the United 
States for further training. 
TRANSLATION 
Small grants have been made to the Nurses’ 
Association of China for the translation of nurs- 
ing textbooks, and to the Publication Com- 
mittee of the China Medical Missionary Asso- 
ciation for an increase in the salary of the Chi- 
nese pundit who is working with Dr. P. B. 
Cousland on the translation, of medical textbooks. 
LOSS IN EXCHANGE 
The marked increase in the cost of silver cur- 
rency has created a problem which all organiza- 
tions interested in China are obliged to face. 
Three years ago it was possible to purchase as 
much as $2.50 Mexican currency for one Ameri-
-P-A-G-E-246
  244 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
can gold dollar, but now $1.50 or $1.75 is as high 
an exchange as can be secured. This, of course, 
has greatly increased the cost of the buildings 
that are being constructed, because Chinese 
currency must be used for the materials pur- 
chased in China and for the wages of the work- 
men. 
Action has been taken by the Board to provide 
for its representatives and teachers in China an 
exchange rate of two Mexican dollars for one 
gold dollar, and at the urgent request of the 
missionary boards who have made similar ar- 
rangements for their employees, the Board ap- 
propriated a sum sufficient to give to all the 
missionary boards this exchange rate on all pay- 
ments made to them by the China Medical 
Board during the year. 
MISCELLANEOUS 
The General Director was absent in Great 
Britain for the five months ended in November. 
During his absence Dr. Henry S. Houghton acted 
as General Director. 
The Resident Director in China gave a large 
part of his time, during the latter half of the year, 
to Red Cross work for the relief of sufferers from 
flood and famine in the region of Tientsin. 
The Board has granted the Resident Director
-P-A-G-E-247

a leave of absence with the understanding that 
he will return to this country on furlough as 
soon as the work in China will permit.

charge of the work there, during the absence of 
the Resident Director.

port of the special war activities of the Rocke- 
feller Institute for Medical Research, which 
have been supported by The Rockefeller Foun- 
dation for the period January 1, 1917, to 
December 31, 1917. 
Respectfully yours, 
SIMON FLEXNER, 
Director of Laboratories.

        WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER 
INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL 
RESEARCH 
The Rockefeller Foundation has made special 
appropriations to the Rockefeller Institute in 
order to enable the Institute to undertake cer- 
tain war activities which it was in position to 
conduct with advantage. These activities are, 
indeed, for the most part outside the precise 
scope of the normal work of the Institute as 
designed by its Founder and Board of Trustees, 
and as carried into effect by the Board of Sci- 
entific Directors. The Institute was created for 
the purpose of promoting medical discovery 
through research. In accordance with the prin- 
ciples on which its work’ was constructed, it has 
left to other agencies the task of carrying into 
effect, on a large scale, any discoveries of practi- 
cal utility which might be made there. How- 
ever, the imminence of war with, and then later 
the actual declaration of war against Germany, 
led the corporation of the Institute to readjust 
its several kinds of activities in order to place 
the facilities of the institution on a war basis. 
Fortunately, the Institute had made contribu- 
tions looking toward the prevention and the 
curative treatment of disease which offered im- 
251

     252 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
mediate application to the medical problems 
likely to arise in connection with the greatly 
enlarged personnel of the Army and Navy, and 
with the inevitable casualties of large training 
camps and of actual warfare. For example, the 
Institute had worked out curative serums for 
epidemic meningitis and for one of the forms of 
pneumonia—both of which diseases have always 
appeared in greater or less force in large military 
organizations; also, under the support of The 
Rockefeller Foundation, Dr. Carrel (in con- 
junction with Dr. Dakin, the chemist) had per- 
fected at Compiégne a method of treating in- 
fected surgical wounds which had come to have 
wide applicability in practice. It seemed, there- 
fore, right and proper that the Rockefeller In- 
stitute should employ its resources in men and 
facilities to aid the Surgeons General of the Army 
and Navy in dealing with their large and impor- 
tant problems. 
Moreover, the fact was patent that medical 
and allied problems, not yet solved, would call 
for work of investigation. The several labora- 
tories of the Institute were so equipped in men 
and materials as to enable it to supplement the 
various research laboratories at the command of 
the Government. These resources were placed 
freely at the disposal of the Surgeons General 
and other governmental agencies, and have been

employed on a wide variety of research problems. 
Meanwhile, the staff of the Institute has suf- 
fered considerable depletion. ‘This has been un- 
avoidable and has been due to two causes. In 
the first place, a considerable number of the 
scientific staff insisted on going into active mili- 
tary service; in the second place, some of that 
staff were peculiarly qualified by special training 
to give their maximum service in connection with 
the expeditionary forces in France. All those 
staff officers a now on leave of absence. On

CARREL-DAKIN TREATMENT OF WOUNDS 
Infected war wounds have been extremely 
numerous as ‘a result of trench warfare. Be- 
cause of this condition, tetanus was for a time 
very prevalent and, until recently, gaseous gan- 
grene and suppuration all too common. The 
incidence of tetanus has been greatly diminished 
through the general employment of the anti- 
tetanic serum administered to wounded men as 
a prophylactic.   
 
-P-A-G-E-258
256 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Of the various means introduced to deal with 
gaseous gangrene and suppuration, the Carrel- 
Dakin method is the one which has come to have 
the greatest application. The method involves 
two essential steps: first, the radical employ- 
ment of an antiseptic made possible by the sur- 
gical conceptions of Dr. Carrel and the devices 
he invented; and second, the employment of an 
active antiseptic solution,—in this case a neu- 
tral solution of sodium hypochlorite devised by 
Dr. Dakin, which is brought into intimate and 
frequent application to the infected tissues. 
The effects of the antiseptic are followed by a 
method of bacteriological control or computa- 
tion introduced by Carrel. Microscopical prep- 
arations are made regularly from the surfaces of 
the wound, the bacteria present are counted, and 
the number found are charted. When under the 
influence of the treatment they fall to a certain 
average number, it is regarded as safe to close 
the wound surgically. By the employment of 
these measures the time factor has been mate- 
rially reduced, and many lives and limbs have 
been saved which otherwise would have been lost. 
PURPOSE OF WAR DEMONSTRATION HOSPITAL 
The War Demonstration Hospital of the 
Rockefeller Institute was planned as a school
-P-A-G-E-259
WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 257 
in which to teach military surgeons the art of 
applying the Carrel-Dakin treatment. The idea 
of a teaching hospital of this kind was conceived 
after the diplomatic break with Germany oc- 
curred and before war was actually declared 
against that country. Dr, Carrel was, fortu- 
nately, in this country at that critical time. He 
had returned for a brief period to the United 
States after having been in constant active ser- 
vice in France since the outbreak of the war. It 
was while he was in charge of the Army Hospital 
at Compiégne, the laboratory of which was sup- 
ported by The Rockefeller Foundation, that the 
method of treatment bearing his and Dr. Dakin’s 
names was perfected. The idea behind the con- 
ception of the War Demonstration Hospital was 
twofold: first, to afford facilities for teaching 
the surgical treatment of infected wounds; and, 
second, to construct a hospital on the best model: 
of the base hospitals developed on the Western 
front. The first patient was received on July 
26, 1917. Since that time, the hospital has been 
in constant operation. It has drawn its patients 
chiefly from the civilian community, but it has 
also drawn a number from the Army and Navy.  
-P-A-G-E-260
  258 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
DESCRIPTION OF WAR DEMONSTRATION HOSPITAL 
In constructing the War Demonstration Hos- 
pital, an endeavor was made to duplicate, on a 
small scale, the best model of the base hospital 
developed on the Western front. The unit 
building system patented by Humphreys, Ltd., 
of London, which has been employed in the base 
hospitals of the British Red Cross and St. John’s 
Guild at Etaples, was adopted with certain modi- 
fications made necessary by American methods 
of construction. 
The Hospital is essentially a portable structure. 
The units of which it is composed are five feet in 
‘length, with side-walls either eight or ten feet in 
height. Each of these panels is of double-wall 
construction, with an air-space between the outer 
and inner sheathing, thus furnishing insulation 
against both heat and cold. For roof trusses, a 
light steel rod system on five foot centres is used. 
This presents the minimum restriction to light, 
and effective head room. This particular type 
of knock-down construction permits elasticity 
in expansion and is also easily transported. 
The plan of the two wards, each of 24-bed 
capacity, follows very closely that of an ordinary 
surgical hospital in peace times. Running north 
and south, the services are grouped at the north 
end so as to allow the free entrance of the winter 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 259 
sun at the south end, which opens on a terrace 
covered in summer with awnings. On each side 
of the ward two wall panels, hinged at the bot- 
tom, are arranged to swing out to permit of rapid 
exit from the building in case of fire. These 
openings also furnish additional ventilation in 
hot weather. Each of the two buildings is 110 
feet in length and 22 feet in width with side- 
walls eight feet in height. For the isolation of 
contagious cases, a separate small building is 
provided. 
The operating pavilion lies east and west so as 
to ensure north light all along one side. For 
this building, 105 feet in length, the wider type 
of unit, 28 feet in width with walls ten feet high, 
has been adopted. At the east end is a large 
work room for nurses, and next to it a sterilizing 
room easily accessible from the operating room. 
The etherizing room gives access both to the 
operating and plaster rooms, while the west end 
of the building is occupied by the X-ray service 
with dark room, demonstration, and storage 
rooms. 
For the reception and discharge of patients a 
separate building is provided. Here, before be- 
ing admitted to the wards, all the wounded are 
cleaned, and their histories taken. Their soiled 
clothing is removed in bags to the laundry build- 
ing, for disinfection and washing, and hospital 
.
-P-A-G-E-262
260 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
clothes are substituted. Storage compartments 
are provided at the east end of this building for 
the cleaned clothing and personal effects, which 
are returned to the patient upon his discharge. 
As far as the limited boundaries of the site 
permit, the pavilions for the nurses and maids 
and the dormitory for the orderlies are isolated. 
Each of these three buildings is 22 feet in width 
with standard side-walls eight feet high. They 
accommodate 18 nurses, eight orderlies, and 
seven maids. 
While a hospital of this small capacity—at 
most 66 beds— would not ordinarily justify a 
separate steam kitchen and laundry, these have 
been included in view of the special object of 
this undertaking. The kitchen is equipped with . 
coal ranges, steam vegetable cookers, and a stock 
kettle. Refrigeration is supplied to the storage 
‘ boxes by a portable compression refrigerating 
plant. A dishwashing plant is installed in one 
section of the kitchen to. which all china is 
returned from the wards and mess rooms. 
The laundry building has two receiving rooms: 
one is for infected clothing, linen, and bedding, 
which must pass through either the sterilizing 
washer or the steam and formaldehyde sterilizer; 
the other is for ordinary soiled linen. Mat- 
tresses and pillows, after sterilization, are stored 
at the west end of the building, while the linen, 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
  WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 261 
after drying and pressing, is'stored near the east 
end on tables and in bins. The mending room 
and small storage room are placed at the ex- 
tremity of the building. 
Parallel to the wards is the laboratory build- 
ing, 135 feet in length and 22 feet in width, con- 
taining the chemical and bacteriological labora- 
tories, pharmacy, and lecture room. The lab- 
oratory provides facilities for the instruction of 
a class of about 30 surgeons at a time. For this 
service, water, gas, and electricity—for both light 
and power—are furnished. 
An administration building contains the gen- 
eral waiting rooms for visitors, with a telephone 
exchange and offices for the executive staff. 
The grouping of the buildings is assigned as 
they would be at a field hospital. Walkways 
are provided between all buildings, differences of 
grade being taken up by inclines rather than by 
the use of steps. Where patients have to pass 
from one building to another, closed corridors are 
provided; otherwise the corridors connecting the 
pavilions are roofed, but open at the sides. 
Adequate heating, ventilating, and sanitary 
conveniences were regarded as essential to the 
proper care of the patients. A pressure heating 
system, using steam pipe coils, has been installed 
and a minimum temperature of 60° main- 
tained during the severe winter weather. A 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
262 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
separate steam line supplies the requirements of 
the laundry, kitchen, and sterilizing equipment. 
The plumbing is that of a permanent hospital, 
but with the suppression of all elaboration. Hot 
water is supplied at central points in various 
buildings by steam coil tanks, so placed that one 
tank supplies a group of three or four buildings, 
the length of runs thereby being much reduced. 
The buildings are lighted by electricity, exposed 
wiring being used throughout. The fixtures, ex- 
cept in the wards and operating buildings, are 
merely bulbs with tin reflectors. 
Through the cooperation of the architect, 
the builder, and the contractor, the 15 barracks 
and huts, together with complete mechanical 
equipment, were erected in the extraordinarily. 
short period of six weeks. 
STAFF OF WAR DEMONSTRATION HOSPITAL 
The staff of the Hospital consists of surgeons 
now assigned by the Surgeon General of the 
Army for instructional purposes, of French mili- 
tary surgeons lent by the French Sanitary Serv- 
ice, and of bacteriologists and chemists in part 
assigned by the Surgeon General. Medical of- 
ficers of the Army and Navy are sent regularly 
for the course of instruction, which ordinarily 
covers a period of two weeks per class. Two
-P-A-G-E-265
WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 263 
classes are therefore conducted each month. 
The medical officers and others (e. g. chemists 
and bacteriologists) are taught the principles of 
the method and are required to cover every one 
of its essential points by actual personal opera- 
tion. They learn to prepare and to titrate, or 
control, the Dakin solution in the chemical lab- 
oratory; to make the microscopical examina- 
tions in the bacteriological laboratory; and to 
prepare the wounds and apply the treatment in 
the operating room and at the bedside. 
INSTRUCTION AT WAR DEMONSTRATION HOSPITAL 
Instruction at the War Demonstration Hos- 
pital has been given during the year to medical 
officers of the Army and Navy, to enlisted men 
of the Army and Navy, to civil surgeons, and to 
female nurses of the Red Cross and of civil hos- 
pitals. For the most part instruction has been 
given to men in classes conducted in the labora- 
tories, in the wards, and in the operating room; 
and by lectures with lantern slides and moving 
pictures. The class work has been arranged in 
the following manner: 
Regular Class. Men assigned to this course 
have been instructed in the clinical methods and 
proper manner of preparing and applying vari- 
ous antiseptics used in the treatment of infected  
-P-A-G-E-266
  264 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
wounds. This course extends over a period of 
two weeks. Twelve courses have been given. 
Special Instruction. At various times special 
instruction has been given to individual medical 
officers, doctors, nurses, and enlisted men; and 
special demonstrations have been arranged for 
groups of medical officers, doctors, and nurses.

In addition to the above, special demonstra- 
tions were given to two groups of surgeons of 
base hospitals, to one surgical class attending 
another school of instruction in New York City,
-P-A-G-E-267
  WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 265 
to one group of civilian surgeons, and to nine 
groups of nurses of base hospitals: a total of 13. 
Eighteen lectures and demonstrations were given 
by members of the staff at various institutions 
and before various medical societies. 
During the year, 106 patients suffering from a 
wide variety of infections have been treated in 
the War Demonstration Hospital. The results 
of the treatment may be briefly stated as follows: 
discharged cured, 42; discharged improved, 19; 
still under treatment, 39; discharged unimproved, 
two; died, four. 
In the treatment of these cases the four prin- 
ciples of treating infected wounds have been 
followed: first, mechanical cleansing, or surgical 
step; second, sterilization by antiseptic; third, 
bacteriological control and control of wound 
healing; fourth, closure. 
Empyema, or pus within the pleural cavity, 
following pneumonia, has been an important 
problem of the military camps during the past 
winter and spring. As a considerable number of 
cases of pneumonia in soldiers and sailors were 
admitted to the Hospital of the Rockefeller 
Institute, a number of cases of empyema devel- 
oped amongthem. These cases were transferred 
to the War Demonstration Hospital for opera- 
tion and treatment. Nine cases, in all, were 
transferred. Of this number two patients 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  266 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
have died and seven are recovering and will, it 
is expected, be returned to duty. The results are 
therefore good. Empyema, especially of the 
streptococcic form in which it has principally pre- 
vailed among our troops, is a serious condition. 
The treatment for this condition, developed in 
the War Demonstration Hospital, has been the 
subject of special study by the Surgeon General 
and has received application in camp base 
hospitals. 
RESEARCH AT WAR DEMONSTRATION HOSPITAL 
The bacteriological and chemical laboratories 
of the Hospital have been engaged not only in 
the instruction of medical officers and others, but 
also in the investigation of certain problems of 
importance. These problems bear on the sur- 
gical treatment of wounds in various aspects. 
They relate to the action of antiseptic drugs other 
than sodium hypochlorite, to improved methods 
of applying the antiseptic to the wounds, to the 
elucidation of the principles of the action of the 
antiseptics, and to particular subjects assigned 
by the Surgeon General in connection with re- 
commendations and suggestions made to him 
from various sources. 
The hygienic care of soldiers in camp and the 
medical care of patients in hospitals rest far more
-P-A-G-E-269
  WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 267 
than the public imagines upon the sciences of 
bacteriology and chemistry. Bacteriology, espe- 
cially, is often invoked to protect a company, 
regiment, or larger unit, from the dangers of a 
severe disease or the disadvantages of a general 
quarantine. Thus, if a case of diphtheria ap- 
pears, any other infected men are quickly 
~ detected and removed on the basis of a bacteri- 
ological test; the same is true with respect to 
epidemic meningitis and some other diseases. 
Once in the hospital, the sick soldier’s progress 
can often be measured best by the bacteriological 
and chemical tests carried out in the laboratory, 
and in every case the results of such examinations 
are of the greatest assistance to the clinician in 
charge of the patients. 
AVAILABLE LABORATORY WORKERS FOR ARMY 
AND NAVY 
The rise of bacteriology and clinical chemistry 
is comparatively recent. Hardly 20 years have 
elapsed since bacteriologists and chemists were 
first recognized as valuable adjuncts to the clini- 
cal staff of the hospital. It is a far shorter 
period since they have been regarded as essen- 
tial to the medical organization for the care of 
the sick. 
The fact was early recognized that the Sur- 
16
-P-A-G-E-270
  268 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
geons General would make heavy demands upon 
the personnel of the bacteriological and clinical 
chemical laboratories of the country. It was 
conceived that probably the existing highly 
trained personnel would prove inadequate to 
meet the needs. On the other hand, it was be- 
lieved that the recent general addition of bac- 
teriology and its handmaiden, immunology 
(serology), to the medical curriculum, and :the 
corresponding improvement in the teaching of 
chemistry in medical schools,.as well as the 
creation of many diagnostic laboratories in hos- 
pitals, would provide a large number of partially 
trained laboratory workers who could readily and 
quickly be prepared to carry out, either alone or 
under supervision, diagnostic work in camp lab- 
oratories. Hence it was proposed to establish 
training courses in bacteriology, serology, and 
(later) medical chemistry for this class of stu- 
dents. The Surgeons General approved the 
project and have assigned medical officers and 
others to the Institute for instruction. 
COURSES IN BACTERIOLOGY 
The laboratories of the Institute give courses 
in bacteriology and serology ‘to medical officers 
of the Army and Navy assigned by the Surgeon 
General of each service. The course in bac-
-P-A-G-E-271
WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 269 
teriology and serology covers four weeks of inten- 
sive work and is repeated once a month. At the 
outset, 20 places were arranged in the labora- 
tory; the number of places have been increased 
to 50. Eligible persons have been accepted from 
the Surgeons General of the Army and Navy; 
also a few civilians who purpose to join the Army 
or Navy have been accepted when space was 
available. Eligibility consists of previous train- 
ing in laboratory methods with special reference 
to bacteriology and serology (or immunology). 
The various laboratories at the cantonments in 
this country, and the department laboratories 
and field laboratories in this country and in 
France, are now provided with men who have had 
the training given at the Rockefeller Institute. 
The chemical course is projected to begin early 
in the spring; each class will continue about four 
weeks. 
Those attending the bacteriological course to 
December 31, 1917, were 103 officers, 26 men in 
the Navy, and 14 special civilians: a total of 143. 
THERAPEUTIC SERUM 
Reference has been made to the fact that the 
Rockefeller Institute originally contributed es- 
sentially to the perfection of the serums for the 
treatment of epidemic meningitis and pneu-  
-P-A-G-E-272
  270 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
monia; it has also taken a leading part in the 
preparation of the antidysenteric serum and 
has recently worked out for the first time a pro- 
tective and curative serum for gaseous gangrene 
(B. welchii infection). 
Before the United States entered the war, the 
Institute—in order to meet the requests emanat- 
ing from England, France, Belgium, Italy, and 
other countries—resumed the preparation of the 
antimeningococcic serum which it had discon- 
tinued several years earlier. The Rockefeller 
Foundation assumed the cost of the resumption 
of that manufacture, through which the serum 
could be supplied gratis to the Allies. Since 
epidemic meningitis exists in an endemic form 
widely in this country, its introduction into mili- 
tary camps was a foregone conclusion. With 
the United States on the brink of war with Ger- 
many, it was considered desirable greatly to 
extend the production of this serum and to in- 
crease also the output of the other serums with 
the perfection of which the Institute had, in the 
first place, been so closely identified. The Rocke- 
feller Foundation made it possible to do this. 
ERECTION OF STABLES 
Commodious, modern stables were quickly 
built at the Department of Animal Pathology at
-P-A-G-E-273
WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 271 
Princeton, and a bacteriological unit was devel- 
oped to control the serum production. The 
main effort was directed towards quantity pro- 
duction of antimeningococcic and antipneu- 
mococcie serums. A small number of horses 
has been given over to the preparation of the 
antidysenteric and antigaseous gangrene se- 
rums. Several months necessarily elapsed be- , 
fore any considerable serum production was 
possible. At the present time the output is sat- 
isfactory and the quality of the products superior. 
PRODUCTION OF SERUM 
The curative serums which the Rockefeller 
Institute is producing for the Army and Navy 
of the United States, and which incidentally are 
being supplied for special purposes to civilian 
communities and to our Allies, are: the anti- 
meningococcic serum for the treatment of epi- 
demic meningitis, the antipneumococcic serum 
for the treatment of lobar pneumonia Type I 
infection, the antidysenteric serum for the treat- 
ment of bacillary dysentery, and the antigaseous 
gangrene serum for the prevention and treatment 
of B. welchii infection. All these serums are 
derived from horses. Only a small number of 
the horses are kept in the animal house in New 
York; the preparation of the serum is carried on  
-P-A-G-E-274
  272 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
chiefly at the Department of Animal Pathology 
at Princeton, New Jersey. The quantities of the 
several serums produced during the year are: 
532.52 litres, or 26,626 bottles, of antimenin- 
gococcic; 22.36 litres, or 1,118 bottles, of anti- 
dysenteric; 280.00 litres of antipneumococcic; 
and 75.00 litres of B. welchit antitoxin. The 
last two are not bottled especially, but are sup- 
plied in large containers. 
ANTIGASEOUS GANGRENE SERUM 
Reference has already been made to the occur- 
rence of gaseous gangrene as a serious form of 
wound infection. Perhaps no_ bacteriological 
war subject has been so widely studied as that 
of gas bacillus infection, because of the severity 
of its effects in infected wounds. All the bel- 
ligerent countries have assigned some of their 
best men to an investigation of that condition. 
Fortunately, Major Carrol G. Bull of the 
Rockefeller Institute was able to establish the 
essential point leading to the solution of the 
problem. He discovered the toxin which the 
bacillus produces and through which it injures 
muscle and other tissues, thus enabling the gas 
bacilli (B. welchii) to multiply and disorganize 
the tissues. The next step was the preparation 
of the antidote, or antigaseous gangrene serum.
-P-A-G-E-275
WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 273 
Dr. Bull has been in England and France 
for several months demonstrating the pro- 
perties of the serum and the manner of its 
preparation. He has already convinced the 
Army medical officers of England and France, 
and those of the United States on active service, 
of the curative, and particularly of the protective, 
powers of the serum. 
ANTITETANIC SERUM 
It is proposed that, as far as practicable, every 
severely wounded man shall receive a pro- 
phylactic or protective injection of the serum. 
As a similar protective injection of the anti- 
tetanic serum is now given (through which te- 
tanus, very frequent in the first months of the 
war, has now been practically abolished), it was 
soon found that both antiserums could be pro- 
duced in the same horse. One injection there- 
fore sufficed for protection against both infections 
and, besides this, the number of horses required 
to produce the serums is reduced by one-half. 
Major Bull will return to this country to in- 
struct manufacturers of biological products in 
the preparation of the combined serum, and to 
investigate further certain other problems in con- 
nection with gangrenous wound infection.  
-P-A-G-E-276
    
274 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
ANTIDYSENTERIC SERUM AND VACCINATION 
Fortunately, dysentery has not been very 
prevalent among our troops. Occasional cases 
do, however, occur and to combat these cases it 
is desirable that antidysenteric serum be avail- 
able. For that reason a small quantity is being 
prepared, as there are no reliable commercial 
sources of the serum and the Institute is closely 
identified with its initial preparation. A method 
of vaccination against bacillary dysentery is 
being worked out at the Institute. Should it 
ever become necessary, vaccination against dys- 
entery could be conducted as it is now con- 
ducted against typhoid fever. 
TREATMENT OF PNEUMONIA 
One of the most serious menaces to the health 
of our troops has been pneumonia. The serum 
developed in the Rockefeller Hospital for treat- 
ment of one of the varieties of this disease, that 
caused by Type I pneumococci, has been dem- 
onstrated to be most efficacious, and every effort 
is being made to cooperate with the Army in 
the proper employment of this serum in suitable 
cases. 
Soldiers suffering from pneumonia are being 
admitted to the Hospital for treatment to as
-P-A-G-E-277
  WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 275 
great an extent as facilities permit. Medical 
officers are sent to the Rockefeller Hospital, 
where they are taught the methods of pneu- 
monia diagnosis and treatment perfected there. 
They live in the Hospital as interns and remain 
for periods of from six weeks to several months. 
The twelve officers who have thus far been 
trained are now in charge of pneumonia patients 
at base hospitals in this country and abroad. 
VACCINATION AGAINST PNEUMONIA 
Preliminary studies concerning the efficacy of 
prophylactic vaccination against pneumonia are 
being carried on under the direction of Dr. Cole. 
Experimental studies indicate that such vac- 
cination may be effective against infection with 
pneumococci, Types I, II, and III, and practi- 
cal experience with antipneumococcus vaccine 
among the miners’‘in South Africa has already 
given indication of its practical value. The pur- 
pose of the studies that are being made is to 
bring sufficient evidence in support of the 
method to justify its employment in the Army. 
EPIDEMIC MENINGITIS 
Meningococcus carriers—healthy men in the 
Army and Navy who have acquired the menin-  
-P-A-G-E-278
  276 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
gococcus in their nasal secretions and continue 
to harbor it there—are a source of danger to 
their associates. The Institute has endeavored 
to assist both the Army and Navy in dealing 
with the problem of these unfortunate men who 
must be kept isolated. Improved methods for 
treating them and freeing them from meningo- 
cocci have been sought. The results on the 
whole have been quite good. Up to the present 
time ten persistent chronic carriers from the 
Army have been sent to the Hospital, all of whom 
have been discharged free from meningococci. 
Meningitis was quite prevalent in certain 
camps during the past winter. The antimen- 
ingococcic serum produced at the Institute 
was supplied in large quantities to the Surgeon 
General for distribution to the several camps. 
In addition, studies on vaccination against 
epidemic meningitis were carried out on a large 
scale at Camp Funston by Lieut. Gates. The 
results of his investigation are now in the hands 
of the Surgeon General. 
_ TREATMENT OF SYPHILIS 
At the laboratories of the Institute a new drug 
for the treatment of syphilis has been perfected 
which it is hoped may supplant salvarsan, at 
least in this country. Before having the drug
-P-A-G-E-279
WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 277 
prepared in large quantities, and before putting it 
out for general use, precise tests of its action and 
the best manner of its administration will be 
carried out at the Hospital. The action of the 
drug in human cases is very satisfactory, bearing 
out the high hopes for its usefulness based on the 
animal tests. It has been patented in this coun- 
try, and patents have been applied for in many 
foreign countries. It is proposed to have it 
manufactured under license, so as to protect the 
public from exorbitant prices and in order to 
insure the quality of the product. In this con- 
nection it may be added that the Institute has 
assisted the Surgeon General in arriving at a 
proper standard of value of salvarsan, which is 
now being manufactured under Government 
license. 
COMBATING HEMORRHAGE AND SHOCK 
One of the most serious consequences of 
wounds received on the battlefield is hemor- 
rhage. Hemorrhage is the basal cause of many 
cases of shock, which in turn is the cause of 
many deaths. 
Studies begun before the war and pursued 
later, for the express purpose of combating 
hemorrhage, have provided two methods of re- 
lieving its effects. Both are now being em-  
-P-A-G-E-280
  278 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
ployed on the Western front. One method is 
the storing of red corpuscles removed from 
healthy persons. These can be resuspended in 
a suitable fluid and injected into the blood 
vessels. Excellent results have been obtained 
in this way. The other method is the employ- 
ment of a sterile solution of gum arabic to replace 
the volume of blood lost. This latter has proved 
an excellent method of reestablishing the blood 
pressure and thus tiding over a very dangerous 
period. The gum solution is far superior to salt 
solution, because the latter leaves the blood 
vessels very soon and fails to maintain the blood 
pressure until the normal mechanism is restored. 
PRODUCTION OF ACETONE 
Acetone is a solvent extensively employed in 
aircraft production. A large program of air- 
craft manufacture calls for immense quanti- 
ties of acetone. The present sources of supply 
are inadequate. Other belligerent countries, 
notably Germany and England, have turned to 
bacterial action for their increased output of the 
solvent. Methods, said to be successful, have 
been devised in both Germany and England; 
they are protected by patents. The precise 
nature of the German method is not known. 
The Weitzman process is used in England. 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
    
      
    
        WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 279 
This problem of perfecting a method of acetone 
production by bacterial action was very early put 
before the Rockefeller Institute. Apparently, 
the problem has now been solved by Dr. J. H. 
Northrup. He has secured from potatoes a 
bacterium which acts upon starch either in the 
pure state or in grain, with the formation of a 
high percentage of acetone. Secondary, or by- 
products, are always formed in these bacterial 
fermentations; in the Weitzman method the 
chief secondary product is said to be butyl 
alcohol, which at present has a limited com- 
mercial application only. Luckily, in the North- 
rup process, the by-product is ethyl (or ordinary 
alcohol), which just now is of high commercial 
value. A patent has been applied for in order 
to protect the method and to enable the Govern- 
ment to use it without the necessity of paying 
royalty. 
SURGICAL INVESTIGATION AT THE FRONT 
Arrangements have been made to set up a 
laboratory at St. Cloud, near Paris, where 
further studies may be made on the repair of 
wounds, on hemorrhage and shock due to sur- 
gical injury, on gunshot wounds of the abdomen, 
and such other problems as may arise. The 
work there will be under the personal direction
-P-A-G-E-282
   
    280 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
of Dr. Carrel. Arrangements have also been 
made for one or more small laboratories in con- 
nection with field ambulances located near the 
front lines. The reason for multiplying the 
small field laboratories arises from the fact that - 
a given sector, served by such an ambulance with 
its laboratory, may be quiet for a time, while in 
another sector, also served in this manner, active 
fighting is going on. It is possible to transfer 
laboratory personnel from one to the other— 
from the quiet to the active sector—and in that 
way forward the studies which the establish- 
ment of the field ambulances was designed to 
accomplish.

adding sundry refunds, was $5,407,282.82, which, added 
to the above figure, made a total of $23,086,134.47 avail- 
able for disbursement. Of this sum $11,457,086.36 was 
disbursed, leaving a balance of $11,629,048.11, which 
should be divided as follows: ,

   The appropriations that become effective in 1918 
amount to $6,223,737.00. If this sum be considered a

the amount available for appropriation is reduced to 
$1,271,337.25. 
The amounts payable on appropriations above specified 
do not include appropriations which become effective in

this sum, unappropriated income will amount to but $1,271,337.25. Neither are 
appropriations and pledges, amounting to $3,363,565.00, which become effective in 1919 and subsequent years, included in the balance sheet. Both of these liabilities 
are, for the purposes of this report, considered as charges against the income for the

PREFATORY STATEMENTS AND ACKNOWLEDG- 
MENTS (FIRST EDITION) 
In the fall of 1913 the writer proposed to Mr. J. W. 
Bridges the task of aiding him in constructing a measur- 
ing scale for intellectual ability which should consist of a 
single series of tests and in connection with which credit 
should be given according to the merit of the subject’s 
response. The suggestion for this type of scale was taken 
from the work of the late Doctor E. B. Huey. The writer’s 
proposal was forced by the conviction that the Binet age- 
scale, with its several groups of measurements and its 
“all-or-none” method of giving credit, was yielding less 
satisfactory information than the interests of the Psy- 
chopathic Hospital demanded. From the first it was our 
intention to develop a better method rather than to 
attempt to modify the Binet Scale. Our interest was 
wholly constructive, and we have been critically destructive 
only in so far as progress seemed to demand destruction. 
This is still our attitude toward the older scale, in spite of the 
fact that we now are fully convinced that it has served its 
most important purpose and must shortly give way wholly 
to a superior method.! 
In the scale which we devised we gave preference to the 
Binet tests because they had been thoroughly tried out 
and could be more readily evaluated than could new mate-

rials. It was our intention to determine the value of the 
single-series and the partial-credit ideas before attempt- 
ing to develop a highly satisfactory form of point. scale. 
We deemed it wiser to content ourselves at the start with 
a pre-adolescent scale than to attempt to construct one 
which should be equally applicable to all ages. But very 
early in our work the idea of a universally applicable 
scale presented itself, and for a time we were strongly 
tempted to strive to achieve this ideal immediately instead 
of working toward it gradually. 
The Point Scale, for which results are now to be pre- 
sented, was avowedly a tentative and provisional group 
of tests. It was ready for use early in 1914, and now, 
approximately a year later, we see clearly the possibility 
of abandoning it in favor of an obviously better scale. 
Immediately upon the completion of the preliminary 
preparations a staff of examiners was organized and sys- 
tematic examining was undertaken in the public schools 
of Cambridge, Massachusetts, as well as in the Psycho- 
pathic Hospital. 
Our hearty thanks and sincere gratitude for their open- 
minded and generous co-operation are due to the school 
authorities of Cambridge, and especially to the Superin- 
tendent, Mr. M. E. Fitzgerald, and to Mr. H. Warren 
Foss. Without the opportunity to apply our methods to a 
reasonably large group of normal children we should 
have been helpless, for the Point Scale’s value depends 
wholly upon reliable norms. 
Between January and June, 1914, upward of seven 
hundred pupils were examined in one grammar school 
and about sixty in another. The first school included 
pupils from the kindergarten to the eighth grade; in the 
second school examinations were made only in the kinder- 
garten and the first grade. While the public school 
examinations were in progress psychopathic and defective 
individuals were being examined daily at the Hospital. 
The number of such subjects to be reported on is about one 
hundred and fifty. During the summer of 1914 the Scale

was also applied to about seventy-five normal adults 
ranging in age from seventeen to forty-three years. 
The statements which are to be made in this book will 
therefore be based upon approximately one thousand 
examinations, although, because of various demands of 
classification, we have been forced to restrict several of our 
groups, and somewhat less than one thousand individuals 
appear regularly in the tables of our report. 
Approximately four-fifths of the examinations to be 
reported were made by five experienced examiners: Mr. J. 
W. Bridges, Mr. R. M. Yerkes, Miss Kate F. Puffer, Miss 
Rose 8. Hardwick and Mr. L. D. Pedrick. The names are 
arranged in the order of frequency of the examinations. 
Substantial help was given also by Mr. J. L. Manahan, 
Mr. H. B. Dine, Miss H. M. Anderson, Miss O. E. Martin, 
Mr. J. A. Bell, Mr. D. G. Nutter, Miss J. C. Perry, Mr. 
G. 8. Goodwin, and Mr. W. F. Dearborn. 
The writers of this report wish to express their appre- 
ciation of the aid in the task of establishing norms for 
the Point Scale so generously and effectively given by 
the persons named above. Their interest and assistance 
greatly encouraged those of us upon whom the burden of 
labor and responsibility rested most heavily. 
To the State Board of Insanity of Massachusetts we 
are indebted for the financial assistance which enabled 
us to arrange for the clerical and stenographic work 
entailed by the preparation of our data for publication. 
We offer this report as a contribution to method of 
mental examining. It has been beyond our purpose to 
discuss similar attempts at the development of measur- 
ing scales or to compare our results with those of other 
observers,—therefore our evident neglect of the literature. 
Our debt to the writings of Thorndike, Whipple, and 
Stern, as well as to those of Binet and Huey, is obvious, 
and we gladly make acknowledgment. Recently many of 
the objections to the Binet-Simon Scale which prompted 
our effort to develop a new method have found expression 
   
-P-A-G-E-12
  4 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
in the psychological literature of at least three countries.! 
Naturally enough, we are encouraged by this evidence of 
widespread appreciation of the need for a more satisfac- 
tory method of estimating mental ability. 
Our scale is in no sense a finished’ product. It was 
originally developed as a pre-adolescent scale, with the 
expectation that, should it prove valuable, a second scale 
would be developed for use with adolescents and adults. 
We have, as this volume will make clear, found reason 
to change our plan and to attempt the development of a 
universally applicable scale which shall replace both our 
preliminary pre-adolescent and our proposed post-adoles- 
cent scales. The original scale has proved useful to us, 
and we firmly believe that, in the revised form in which 
we recommend it for application, it will prove increas- 
ingly serviceable to all who employ it. It is our earnest 
hope that the method may prove to be an important step 
forward.

INTRODUCTION TO REVISED EDITION 
When in 1917 the World War interrupted constructive 
psychological work at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital, 
two point scales supplementary to the original Pre-adoles- 
cent Scale were in process of construction. One was to 
extend the applicability of the point scale method to adoles- 
cents and adults and the other to children under seven 
years of age. It was intended to approach the construction 
of a universal point scale by perfecting three limited-range 
scales. Primarily responsible for the construction of the 
original Point Scale were Messrs. Yerkes and Bridges and 
Miss Hardwick; for the Adolescent-adult Scale, Messrs. 
Yerkes and Rossy; and for the Infant Scale (more properly 
Child Scale), Miss Josephine Curtis. 
The immediate cause for the preparation of this revision 
of the Point Scale book is the exhaustion of the original 
edition and the decision of the publishers to re-set the book 
as first written or as revised. In spite of the relative incom- 
pleteness of the two new scales it has been decided to 
present them with such results as have been obtained. 
Any one of the three scales may be used to advantage 
by an experienced examiner who is willing to take advan- 
tage of indications for improvement and either to establish 
new norms or to use critically those offered in the present 
volume. 
Since the authors of the first edition were otherwise 
engaged and had given little attention to methodological 
work on the Point Scale since 1917, it was arranged that 
Mrs. Josephine Curtis Foster should take major responsi- 
bility for the task of revising, and in effect re-writing, the 
book. 
In order to make room for new materials without over- 
much extending the volume, those chapters of the first

edition which present the history of the method, its initial 
form, and the results upon which the Pre-adolescent Point 
Scale was based, are omitted. The Pre-adolescent Scale 
is presented essentially as in the first edition, but in the 
directions for administration slight changes have been made 
as indicated by experience, and there have been added for 
the convenience of examiners many illustrative responses. 
But even more important than these modifications are the 
summary reports of results and the new and revised norms 
or standards of comparison which it is now possible to offer. 
They should greatly increase the usefulness of the point 
scale method and the reliability of its results. 
Although the greater part of the volume is devoted to the 
Pre-adolescent Point Scale, the two supplementary scales— 
adult and infant—are fully described, and thus made 
available to examiners who may desire to use them. 
Special attention is given to the value of the point scale 
method in the examination of abnormal subjects. It 
has been definitely established that the method has superior 
value in hospitals for the mentally deranged and special 
institutions for defectives and delinquents. 
The authors gratefully acknowledge their obligations to 
Doctors Bird T. Baldwin, John E. Anderson, and H. 
Egerton Brown for permission to use results of point scale 
examination; to Miss Lucy Dewey for compilation of point 
scale bibliography, and to the Boston Medical and Surgical 
Journal, the Journal of Applied Psychology, and the 
Journal of Abnormal Psychology for permission to reprint 
materials.

CHAPTER 1 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE POINT SCALE 
METHOD AND COMPARISON WITH THE 
BINET SCALES 
The Point Scale is an intelligence examination on the 
principle of a scale of tests graduated by credit points. 
It is intended for use with subjects over a range of mental 
ages from 3 to approximately 16. Its accuracy and relia- 
bility are greatest between the ages of 6 and 12. The 
results of the examination are expressed in total scores 
ranging between 0 and 100. Scores may be transferred 
into mental age ratings or may be directly interpreted by 
reference to a table of norms. 
The tests have been derived from various sources, but 
material from the Binet scale predominates. Modifica- 
tions both of material and of procedure have been intro- 
duced freely wherever any advantage appeared to be gained 
thereby. For example, in the description of pictures, test 7, 
the test question was altered in order not to suggest the 
form of response. 
Other things being equal, preference has been given to 
tests applicable through a considerable range of years, such 
as memory span and free association; and the differing 
reactions to a given test which are characteristic of suc- 
cessive stages of mental growth have been discriminated 
in the scoring wherever easily recognizable. For example, 
four gradations are recognized in the free associations test, 
two in definitions of concrete terms, four in counting back- 
wards, andsoon. ‘To this end, also, the subdivisions of each 
test are credited separately, and in several instances partial 
credits are allowed on the subdivisions. In the compari- 
“sons of remembered objects, for instance, 1 point is allowed 
for one item of difference and 2 points for two or more such 
items.

8 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
The scale consists of over fifty questions grouped to form 
twenty tests. For each part of each test which is answered 
the subject receives a certain score, and at the end of the 
examination the scores for all twenty tests are added together 
to give a total score. Then from a table of norms, we find 
at what chronological age the average child attains that 
particular score, and this is, of course, the mental age of our 
subject. The IQ is obtained in the usual manner by divid- 
ing mental by chronological age. Thus, if a child of 10 
years and 6 months, or expressed in decimals 10.5, receives 
a score of 69 points, we find from the table of norms that 
his mental age is 11.8. His IQ is, then, 11.8 divided by 
10.5, or 1.12. 
The Point Scale differs from the variousforms of the Binet 
Scale in a number of ways. In the first place the entire 
Point Scale is given to each child examined.! Such a 
procedure is impractical with the Stanford revision of the 
Binet on account of the length of the examination, the 
amount of time which would be consumed, and the result- 
ing fatigue in the younger children. Giving all the tests 
eliminates the possibility of an error in determining the 
point where the examination shall begin and the point 
where it shall end. Although such terminal points are 
fairly easily determined in the cases of normal children, they 
are much more variable in mental deficiency, epilepsy, 
dementia praecox, and all abnormal cases. In some such 
cases for example, the mental age varies greatly from day 
to day. Sarah K—, a girl of fifteen, attained a score 
late one afternoon which gave her a mental age of 5.6 
years, but when tested again the following morning, was 
found to have adult mental age. Additional data gave 
evidence that the first examination happened to have been 
1 There is one case in which this rule may be neglected. If we are exam- 
ining a four year old child who answers the question “What is a spoon?” 
by repeating ‘‘spoon”’ and who gives the same kind of reply for definitions 
of the other concrete words, there is obviously no necessity of asking for 
definitions of abstract terms. Such omissions are allowable only with very 
young children, and then only when the easier parts of the test have been 
failed entirely.

  GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE POINT SCALE 9 
given at the end of an acute mental attack which cleared 
up completely before the next morning. In cases like this, 
it is essential that the entire examination be given. It 
happened that Sarah failed the great majority of the easy 
and passed a few of the much more difficult tests. If ayear 
scale like the Binet had been used, none but a very experi- 
enced examiner would have considered the possibility of her 
passing any of the harder tests. When the examination 
was repeated the next day and the more difficult tests as 
well as the easy ones were passed, the query would imme- 
diately arise whether the hard questions might not have 
been answered the first time if they had been asked. Such 
uncertainty cannot occur when the entire examination is 
invariably given. 
A second advantage of a point scale over a year scale 
lies in the fact that for each test numerical credit is 
allowed not merely for pass or fail, but for various degrees 
of success between such limits. Terman says! “‘It makes 
much difference . . . whether success in repeating six 
digits is earned by repeating all three (groups of digits) 
correctly or only one; or whether the child’s lack of success 
with the absurdities is due to failure on 2, 3, 4, or all of 
them,” and, therefore, he suggested that “‘each division of 
a test should be scored separately in order that the clinical 
picture may be as complete as possible. This helps in the 
final evaluation of the results.” Thus, in the Stanford 
revision, if Henry detects four out of the five absurdities, he 
passes the test; if he detects all five, he passes and the 
examiner must remember in the final summarizing of the 
case, that Henry passed the absurdities well; if Henry 
detects only three, he fails, but the examiner must remember 
that he barely failed; and if Henry detects none, the examiner 
must remember that he failed totally. Suppose that at the 
end of the examination the examiner has to remember that 
Henry barely failed the absurdities, barely failed the 
comprehension of questions, and barely failed the giving of

sixty words in three minutes, what shall he do? add a 
month of mental age? or what? In the Point Scale, there 
is no doubt as to procedure, for Henry gets credit for 
exactly what he does, that is, he get three points for detect- 
ing three absurdities, four for detecting four, etc. In the 
year scale, the most exact scoring possible is to add a 
“plus” to tests passed exceptionally well, and a ‘‘minus” to 
those which are barely passed. Then at the end of the 
examination, if there are equal numbers of plus and minus 
signs, we may ignore them; if there are many more of the 
plus, then our mental age as calculated is too low; if there 
are many more of the minus, then our mental age is too 
high. Such a method obviously is not so exact as a point 
scale method. 
Furthermore, in a Point Scale, the individual tests may be 
scientifically weighted, whereas in a year scale, all tests are 
treated as of equal value. Thus for some tests in the Point 
Scale, such as ‘‘comprehension of questions” in which there 
are several parts, and where the answers may show 
a number of degrees of mental acuity, the child may receive 
a score from 0 to 8, whereas in the comparison of line- 
lengths, the highest possible score is one. This means 
that it is possible to give more weight to those tests which 
correlate most highly with the criteria of intelligence (age, 
school success, etc.). 
A further advantage of the Point Scale is that all tests of 
one kind are given together.t Many examiners who use 
the Stanford Revision of the Binet have found it expedient 
to give all of the tests of memory span together, but the 
form of that scale necessitates turning from IV, 6 to VII, 3, 
to Superior Adult, 3; or in giving repetition of sentences, 
turning from III, 6 to VI, 6 and to still other ages if the 
alternative tests are needed. 
Still another advantage is the greater ease of alteration 
of the Point Scale. With the accumulation of more and 
more results, intelligence tests are constantly being revised. 
1 Exceptions to this are found in tests 3 (b and c) and 8; in tests 10 and 19; 
and in tests 14 and 16. See p. 19.
-P-A-G-E-19
  
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE POINT SCALE 11 
In a year-scale this revision renders difficult or impossible 
the accurate comparison of results obtained with different 
revisions. For example, the Goddard revision of the Binet 
gives the naming of familiar objects and the giving of sex as 
4-year tests, the Stanford revision places them in the 3-year 
group; the Goddard revision gives counting pennies and 
copying a square as 5-year tests, the Stanford as 4-year. 
Now suppose that in January John is given a mental age of 
4.0 on the Goddard revision and that he has attained this 
mental age by passing all of year 3, all of year 4 except 
giving sex and naming familiar objects, and in year 5 has 
passed copying the square and counting pennies. In the 
following January he is given the Stanford revision, and 
passes all the 3-year tests (including the naming of familiar 
objects and the giving of sex), and in year 4, compares 
lines, copies the square, and counts the pennies. He receives 
a mental age of three years and six months, which is half a 
year less than his mental age twelve months before. Unless 
results for each test were consulted, we would suppose that 
John had deteriorated, instead of actually passing more 
tests than he did in the first examination. This, of course, 
would be an extreme case, but it might very well happen. 
If the child had been examined with the Point Scale both 
times, even if the accumulation of data had resulted in a 
change in the point scale norms between the two examina- 
tions, we could easily calculate what the earlier mental 
age would be if based upon the later norms. Of course, if 
the revision goes to the extent of introducing entirely new 
tests, in neither type of scale is it possible to make complete 
comparisons with previous results. 
We have suggested a number of advantages which a 
point scale has over a year scale, particularly in the more 
exact grading of responses and the greater ease of revision. 
We come now to what in our minds is by far the greatest 
superiority of a point scale; its research and diagnostic 
value. Year-scales are of most value for use with normal 
or feeble-minded children, but the Point Scale may be used 
to equal advantage in the examination: of all types of
-P-A-G-E-20
  
12 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
abnormality. In order to use the Point Scale with any 
special group such as the blind or the deaf, we have two 
available methods: to secure data upon a fairly large group 
of blind or of deaf, and compile a table of norms to be used 
in place of the ordinary norms; or to follow the scheme 
which we present (p. 81ff) and calculate a series of correc- 
tions to be-added to the total score obtained after omitting 
the tests which are impossible for the blind (or the deaf). 
Again, the Point Scale may safely be used with elderly 
people once we know what type of examination record 
these persons tend to give (see p. 77ff). Since the entire 
examination is given to each subject, since like questions 
are grouped together instead of being scattered through the 
examination in the order of difficulty, and since many 
abnormal cases tend to do particularly well or particularly 
poorly on some special kind of question, the Point Scale is 
pre-eminently fitted to reveal unusual patterns of response. 
For example, it has been shown that certain types of insanity 
are very apt to give unusual results in certain of the memory 
tests. Without doubt, further investigation will reveal 
many other typical failures or successes. We should 
suppose, for instance, that manic patients would tend to 
give many words in three minutes (test 13), while depressed 
patients would give few. There is opportunity for profit- 
able research in the responses of abnormal subjects to the 
Point Scale examination. 
Not only do the arrangement of the Point Scale and the 
fact that the entire examination is given to each patient fit 
it for use with abnormal cases, but the fact that each test is 
given a more finely numerical score means that the results 
are open to more exact mathematical treatment. We can 
express our results in averages, medians, and modes as well 
as in the percentage attaining each score; we can calculate - 
variations; we can run correlations; we can use graphs; in 
fact, we can use any of the ordinary statistical methods for 
treating results.

-P-A-G-E-21
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE POINT SCALE 13 
To be sure, with year scales we can use similar mathemat- 
ical methods on our results as long as we are concerned 
with mental ages, but when we try to discover the ability 
of any particular group to pass any particular test, we are 
hampered by two facts. (1) Since the score for each testis 
merely “‘passed” or ‘‘failed,” the median and the mode will 
be identical and an average of .5 or more means that the 
median and mode will both be 1, while an average of .49 or 
less means that the median and mode will both be 0. 
This is merely a restatement of the fact that the grading on 
point scale tests is more refined. (2) Since the entire Binet 
examination is not given to each subject, we cannot actually 
gain from the results the numerical data for the separate 
tests. Suppose, for example, that we happen to be study- 
ing a group of dementia praecox patients, and suppose 
that A receives a mental age of 5 yr. 0 mo. by passing 
all of year IV, and all of year V, including test 4 (the 
repetition of 4 digits), but since he fails all the VI year tests 
(although he fails V1, 2, missing parts, because he passes 
only 2) he is not given VII, 3 (repetition of 5 digits). 
Patient B, however, attains his mental age of 5 yr. 0 mo. by 
passing all of year IV, and by passingin addition V, 1, 2, 3, 4 
VI, 2 and VII, 3 (repetition of 5 digits). This means that 
since B happened to give three missing parts correctly 
instead of only two as A did, B is given a chance at the 
7-year tests, while A is not. Now suppose we want to 
state the average memory span for digits for dementia 
praecox patients of mental age 5. Shall we say that A’s 
memory span is 4, just because he did not have an opportu- 
nity to try 5? For all we know, they both may have 
memory spans of eight or nine! A similar case, and one 
which as we shall see later, surely would arise in using the 
Stanford revision on elderly or psychotic persons, would 
appear in the ‘‘comprehension of questions” tests. Of 
these, there are four in the Stanford revision, falling at 
years IV, 5, V, 4, VIII, 3 and X, 5. This test is one in 
which older people do remarkably well, even when they 
have deteriorated appreciably and the examination is
-P-A-G-E-22
  
14 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
obviously unfair to such subjects if any of these questions 
are omitted. But if we follow the rule of year scales and 
discontinue the examination when all the tests of one year 
have been failed, then an old or psychotic person who 
fails all of year V or all of year VII, or all of year IX has 
lost his opportunity to answer questions which are based 
chiefly upon experience. 
Thus we see that if we are interested in the special abili- 
ties of abnormal persons as measured by their performance 
on different tests, the Point Scale is more satisfactory than a 
year scale. 
Perhaps a word should be added here in regard to the use 
of the Point Scale and the Stanford revision of the Binet as 
alternatives for each other. We often wish to test a child 
every 6 months or every year, and it is extremely desirable 
that the child should not remember the examinations 
exactly. He may do himself an injustice on the second 
examination. For example, if he recognizes the question 
and remembers the examiner’s praise for his former answer 
he may attempt to repeat what he said before, in spite of 
the fact that if he attacked the question now for the first 
time, his answer might be superior. In such. cases, it is 
often advisable to give the Point Scale as the first examina- 
tion, and then 6 months or a year later to give the 
Stanford revision. There are, to be sure, many identical 
tests, but there are enough different ones to prevent the 
identification of the two examinations in the mind of the 
child. That the two examinations may be used thus 
without serious divergence in the results is shown in7the 
fact that the correlation between results on the two scales 
has been found? to be .87.

CHAPTER 2 
DIRECTIONS FOR GIVING THE PRE-ADOLESCENT 
POINT SCALE 
GENERAL DIRECTIONS 
Place.—The examination should take place in a quiet, 
fairly small room. The attention of small children is so 
easily distracted that, if possible, the room should not be on 
the street, and the door should be kept closed so that the 
child can neither see nor hear persons passing by.. A picture 
or two on the walls may be of service in getting acquainted 
with the child, but too many interesting objects in view will 
serve merely to distract his attention from the examination. 
Arrangement of Material——All the materials necessary 
for the test with the exception of the five weighted blocks, 
are printed at the end of this volume, but for regular 
use it will be found much more convenient to use a set of 
materials as they are printed upon loose cards.!_ The cards 
can then be placed on the desk before the child with little 
danger of the page being blown or turned over prematurely. 
Moreover, all such materials soil quickly, and ink spots 
and finger prints act as distractions. Some workers have 
made celluloid covers for the different cards, but we have 
found the most satisfactory method to be merely to throw 
the cards away when they become too soiled. This set of 
cards is most conveniently handled when they are strung 
together to make a little booklet. Then when not in use 
the booklet may be hung, together with another similar 
booklet containing the various norms, at the end of the 
desk away from the subject’s chair, and so be always at 
hand and yet out of sight. In making up the booklet out 
of the cards, arrange the cards in the order in which they are

-P-A-G-E-24

to be used. Then, using black gummed letters one half 
inch high, on the back of a convenient card write ‘‘ Boston! 
money river,’ and on the backs of other convenient pages 
write the dissected sentences with the same gummed letters. 
These sentences can be read by many subjects whose poor 
eyesight renders illegible the sentences as they are printed 
on the cards or in the book and they may be used for all 
subjects if the examiner likes. The examiner will find it 
convenient to keep the five weighted block in front of him 
on the desk, arranged in the correct order with the numbers 
on the under side. He can then select the desired blocks 
quickly without referring to the numbers, and so. keep many 
subjects from suspecting that the blocks are labelled. 
Treatment of Subject.—Experience shows that the best 
procedure with children is to start conversation with them 
before they are seated beside the desk. There seems to be 
something awe-inspiring to many children in being seated 
in a chair facing an examiner at a desk, and oftentimes there 
is a resulting shyness which it is difficult to overcome. If 
the examiner himself goes to the waiting-room or to the 
class-room for the child, then the natural procedure is to 
take the child by the hand, and as you lead him along, to 
ask him such simple questions as his name, number of 
brothers and sisters, etc. If the child is brought into the 
examining-room by another person, we have found that 
the examination proceeds more quickly and smoothly if the 
examiner looks up at the moment the child enters the room 
and says ‘‘Hello! What is your name?” and then; ‘How 
old are you?” By the time these questions are answered 
the child is near the desk, the ice is broken, and after his 
school-grade is learned, the test begins in an easy conversa- 
tional manner. 
The treatment of adults usually requires more tact. 
They often resent the persistent and apparently senseless 
questioning from a person many years their junior. The 
examiner must use his own judgment in deciding the best 
manner of approaching each subject. Many patients in 
1 Or the name of the town in which the examination is given.  
-P-A-G-E-25
  
DIRECTIONS FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 7 
hospitals are so accustomed to questionings of all sorts 
that the suggestion that this is merely a part of the hospital 
routine or red tape suffices to procure cooperation, but 
with some superior adults it may be necessary to assume the 
confidential attitude that ‘“‘of course you and I know that 
your mind is perfectly clear, but let’s get it down in black 
and white that you could answer these questions.” 
When the examination is once begun, it should proceed 
smoothly and as rapidly as possible without haste. The 
expert examiner is able to record one answer while he is ask- 
ing the next question. This method also saves the examiner 
much bother, for many children who are not kept busy while 
the examiner records will handle everything within reach, 
or their attention may wander to other interests. 
The subject should never be corrected or shown that his 
answer is poor, but, on the contrary, should be constantly 
encouraged by such comments as ‘Good!’ ‘‘That’s fine!”’ 
etc. Such praise can, of course, be overdone. Adult 
subjects of fairly high intelligence may with reason be 
scornful when an inexperienced examiner acts as if the 
discrimination between a long and a short line is a remark- 
ably clever performance! Once again, the examiner must 
use his own good judgment. Small children and low-grade 
feeble-minded adults usually give the best results under 
lavish commendation. Perhaps the safest rule to follow is: 
Treat each subject in the way which he will consider most 
sincerely complimentary. 
Personality of the Examiner.—Examiners vary greatly in 
personality and consequently in success in securing coopera- 
tion. Some prove particularly successful in handling a 
specific type of subject. Most children and young adults 
will give satisfactory results for any experienced examiner. 
Those fitted for work with psychopathic cases, with very 
young children or very old peaple are less common. In the 
long run, women are more successful than men, chiefly 
because there are many cases which are difficult for a man 
to handle. Oftentimes a psychopathic, adolescent girl is 
too busy trying to flirt with a male examiner to be bothered 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  
18 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
with answering questions, and many times a man is not 
quick enough or ‘‘natural” enough to do well with children. 
Presence of Others.—No third person should be allowed 
in the room. If the examination is a demonstration, the 
observer should sit at some distance, and somewhat back 
of the child, and should not show the slightest interest in 
what is going on. Then if the examiner ignores the visitor, 
the chances are that the child will also. Never should the 
child’s teacher be admitted, and no member of the family 
should be present unless it is absolutely necessary to use 
one of them as an interpreter. In case several members of 
an immigrant family are to be examined, the child with the 
best command of English should be examined first, and 
then that child may act as an interpreter for the others. 
It might seem as if by this method all our results would be 
merely the answers of the interpreting child. On the 
contrary we have had many cases where the second member 
of the family graded considerably higher or considerably 
lower than the interpreter. Of course, if the child is 
unable to understand the more difficult questions, there is 
little chance that he can interpret them correctly, but even 
so it is possible to get a fairly good notion as to the mentality 
of the rest of the family. If any considerable number of 
non-English speaking people is to be tested, it is worth while 
to have the questions translated into the desired language. 
Wording of Questions.—The inexperienced examiner 
should adhere strictly to the wording of the tests. He 
should remember that any rephrasing of his own may 
invalidate not only the examination that he is giving but 
also all tests which the child may be given in the immediate 
future. It is not unusual to have a child exclaim during a 
second examination “‘The other lady didn’t say that.” 
With great experience, the examiner may discover a few 
minor changes in phraseology which may be used safely. 
Records.—In so far as possible, the subject’s responses 
should be recorded in full. In particular, notes should be 
kept on the subject’s general attitude (cooperative, restless, 
etc.) and on any special unusual conditions (foreign  
-P-A-G-E-27
  DIRECTIONS FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE al) 
speaking, deafness, stuttering, etc.). All available data on 
the points listed under ‘‘Interpretation of results” below (p. 
22) should be collected and noted by the examiner or others. 
Order of Giving the Tests——The examiner will find it 
convenient to give test 8 (arrangement of weights) immedi- 
ately after 3 (c) (comparison of 6 and 15 gms.) Similarly, 
since tests 10 and 19 are both questions of definition, it is 
very easy to slip from “‘ What is a baby?” (the last part of 
test 10) to “What does charity mean?” (the first part of 
test 19). Again, the square and diamond (test 12) are 
copied on the back of the record sheet, and the examiner 
will find it saves time to give test 16 (drawings from 
memory), next, while the child is thinking of drawings, then 
test 14 (sentence containing three given words), since this 
test also requires the use of the back of the record sheet. 
Probably the most time-saving order to giving the tests 
and the order least tiring to the subject is 1, 2, 3, 8, 4, 5, 6, 7, 
9, 10, 19, 11, 12, 16, 14, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20. 
Calculation of Mental Age and IQ.—When all the tests 
have been given and scored, the scores for the separate 
tests should be added together for a total score. Then if 
the subject is the child of English speaking parents, refer 
to the table of norms on p. 60 to discover what mental age 
corresponds to that particular total score. Calculate the 
child’s chronological age in tenths. Thus: 
Aime. 1 Yr: 5mo. 4yr. 9mo. .S8yr. 
2mo. .2 yr. 6mo. .5 yr. 10 mo. .8 yr. 
SIM0.** 3 yr: Tmo. .6 yr. This 
4mo. .3 yr. Rime. 7 yr. 
and then divide mental by chronological age. This gives 
the Intelligence Quotient! (IQ). For example, if a child 
1 It was the early practice in the Point Scale to obtain not an IQ but a CI 
(coefficient of intelligence, the ratio of the total score obtained to the total 
score expected at the chronological age of the subject), but for various 
reasons (see Curtis, J. N.: Point scale examinations on the high grade feeble 
minded and the insane. Journ. of Abnormal Psychology, vol. 13, 1918, 
p. 77ff.) it has seemed best to conform with the more common usage of other 
scales and use the IQ.
-P-A-G-E-28
  20 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
of chronological age 9.5 receives a total score of 59, by refer- 
ing to the table of norms (p. 60) we find the corresponding 
mental age to be 10.2 Then by dividing mental age by 
chronological age, we obtain the ratio “ or 1.07 as the 
IQ. If the subject is an adult, it is obviously unfair to use 
his chronological age as divisor, since the highest possible 
mental age obtainable on the scale is 18. If a man of 60 
obtains a mental age of 18, and we use 60 as a divisor, we 
obtain an IQ of .30, which would place the subject as defi- 
nitely feeble-minded, despite the fact that he obtained a very 
high score. It has been found that mental age increases 
but little after the 16th year, and therefore for all persons of 
chronological age of 16 or over, we use 16 as a divisor in 
obtaining the IQ. Thus in the case cited of the 60 year old 
man, we should divide his mental age by 16 instead of 60, 
and obtain as his IQ 1.13. Similarly if an adult receives a 
mental age of 16, his IQ will be a or 1.00. If the total 
score is greater than 88, we record his mental age as 18+, 
and the IQ as 1.183+. Since we are thus unable to dif- 
ferentiate between the mental ages and IQ’s of persons 
grading above 88 points, this Point Scale is really unsuited 
for work with above average or superior adults, and such 
persons should be examined with the Adolescent-Adult 
Point Scale described in Chapter 5. 
The use of 16 as the expected mental age for adults may 
be questioned in the light of the experience of the psychologi- 
cal examiners in the United States army. They found, it 
will be remembered, that the average mental age for the 
white draft was approximately 14.0. Why then, it may be 
asked, do we not accept 14 as average adult mental age? 
The chief reason for persisting in the use of 16 is the fact 
that the point scale score continues to increase beyond the 
age of 14. 
Interpretation of Results——We must now consider the 
interpretation of results. What should we recommend for
-P-A-G-E-29
DIRECTIONS FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 21 
a child whose IQ is .40? or .80? or 1.20? Terman! sum- 
marizes the IQ’s of 1000 unselected children as follows: 
The lowest 1 per cent. go to 70 or below, the highest 1 per cent. reach 130 
or above. 
The lowest 2 per cent. go to 73 or below, the highest 2 per cent. reach 128 
or above. 
The lowest 3 per cent. go to 76 or below, the highest 3 per cent. reach 125 
or above. 
The lowest 5 per cent. go to 78 or below, the highest 5 per cent. reach 122 
or above. 
The lowest 10 per cent. go to 85 or below, the highest 10 per cent. reach 116 
or above. 
The lowest 15 per cent. go to 88 or below, the highest 15 per cent. reach 113 
or above. 
The lowest 20 per cent. go to 91 or below, the highest 20 per cent. reach 110 
or above. 
The lowest 25 per cent. go to 92 or below, the highest 25 per cent. reach 108 
or above. 
The lowest 3314 per cent. go to 95 or below, the highest 3314 per cent. reach 
106 or above. 
Or, to put some of the above facts in another form: 
The child reaching............ 110 is equaled or excelled by 20 out of 100 
The child reaching (about)..... 115 is equaled or excelled by 10 out of 100 
The child reaching (about)..... 125 is equaled or excelled by 3 out of 100 
The child reaching (about)..... 130 is equaled or excelled by 1 out of 100 
Conversely, we may say regarding the sub-normals that: 
The child testing at (about).. 90 is equaled or excelled by 80 out of 100 
The child testing at (about).. 85 is equaled or excelled by 90 out of 100 
The child testing at (about).. 75 is equaled or excelled by 97 out of 100 
The child testing at (about).. 70 is equaled or excelled by 99 out of 100 
Terman then gives the following classification of intelli- 
gence quotients: 
IQ CrassiricaTIon 
Above 140 “Near genius” or genius. 
120-140‘ Very superior intelligence. 
110-120 Superior intelligence. 
90-110 Normal, or average, intelligence. 
80-90 Dullness, rarely classifiable as feeble-mindedness. 
70-80 Border-line deficiency, sometimes classifiable as dulness, 
often as feeble-mindedness, 
Below 70 Definite feeble-mindedness. 
Thus we may suppose that practically all children having 
an IQ less than 70 are feeble-minded. But never should 
1Op. cit., p. 78ff.

  22 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
such a diagnosis be made on the IQ alone. We must 
remember that numerous other conditions tend to lower the 
IQ. In the first place there is the rare case where the 
examiner fails, without realizing it, to gain the confidence 
of the shy child, and the hanging head, averted eyes, open 
mouth, and failure to attempt any but the simplest ques- 
tions, may easily suggest feeble-mindedness. Then too, 
there are the cases of physical disease (fever, etc.) or 
psychosis where the mental age and IQ may be low tem- 
porarily, but may shortly come back to a normal level. 
Moreover, there are cases of deterioration, due to mental 
disease or to advancing age which may show a mental age 
suggestive of mental deficiency. To make a true diagnosis 
of feeble-mindedness, we need the judgment of the psychia- 
trist, social worker, teacher, as well as that of the psycholo- 
gist. If the psychologist is compelled to work without the 
assistance of these other specialists, he must take upon 
himself the gathering of data upon all such points as the 
following: 
. Physical examination of the subject. 
. Developmental history of the subject. 
. Disease history of the subject. 
School history. 
School knowledge and general information. 
. Social history. 
. Economic history. 
. Family history. 
The physical examination must cover all such points as 
eyesight, hearing, the presence of adenoids, or mouth 
breathing, stuttering, malnutrition, and other defects. 
All of these physical defects have been known to cause 
“apparent stupidity which disappeared as soon as the 
defects were removed. In such cases injustice and definite 
social injury might be done to the child if he were dubbed 
feeble-minded. 
The developmental history of the subject must cover 
such points as to whether or not he was a full term child, 
ONDOowPPWNHE
-P-A-G-E-31
  
DIRECTIONS FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 23 
whether the birth was normal,! at what. age he first walked, 
and at what age he first talked. If these activities were 
unusually slow in making their appearance, we have addi- 
tional evidence of feeble-mindedness, for in cases of serious 
mental defect, the child usually shows his retardation early. 
We must study the disease history of the child and inquire 
particularly concerning scarlet fever, syphilis, and meningi- 
tis. Any of these may have injured the brain permanently. 
The school history should include the age at which the 
subject first entered school, his progress through the grades, 
whether or not he was a repeater, perhaps his school marks, 
and surely the present grade or the highest grade reached 
and the age at which he left school. 
Whether or not the subject has left school, it is important 
to know how much he has retained of what he was taught 
in school. With children still in school or recently gradu- 
ated, this is easily obtained by some such simple examina- 
tion as that given in the accompanying foot-note.2, With 
1 Many parents hate to acknowledge the presence of feeble-mindedness in 
their families, and tend to explain the evident feeble-mindedness of a 
child of theirs as due to birth injury. Statistics show that such cases 
are really rare, and we must, therefore, add a “‘grain of salt”’ to these reports 
and persist in the attempt to discover abnormalities in relatives.

adult subjects we must beware of expecting the details of 
school knowledge to be retained. A number of adult college 
graduates, all in professions, were asked to draw outline 
maps of South America and of Africa, putting in the chief 
countries. About one-fifth of the maps of South America 
were approximately correct, that is, not more than one or 
two countries were omitted or misplaced, while only about 
one-tenth of the maps of Africa included more than Egypt, 
the Desert of Sahara, and one or two Barbary states. 
Almost every pair of maps had some glaring error such as 
the placing of Madagascar on the east coast of South 
America. Do not, then, expect adults to retain school 
knowledge which they have not used since they left school. 
More important with these elder subjects, and also of 
considerable importance with children, is the amount of 
general information which they have acquired. Several 
lists of such general information questions have been 
compiled and they include such things as the distance 
between the place of residence and the next large town, the 
cost of various articles of clothing, etc.

The social history of a child is concerned with whether or 
_ not he plays with other children, whether or not he has 
been a delinquent, a truant, a petty liar or a petty thief. 
With older subjects we must inquire about his attitude 
toward his neighbors. Is the patient sociable, or is he 
more or less shut in? Many cases of insanity show them- 
selves first in suspiciousness directed toward friends and 
neighbors, and in inability to get along with other people. 
We must inquire further into the subject’s economic 
history. What is his occupation;! his pay; what are his 
special interests? Is he holding his jobs steadily or is he 
constantly losing them or shifting to other places of his 
own accord? Any data showing the subject to be ineffi- 
cient or to lack in ‘“‘sticktoitiveness”’ is of great importance 
in suggesting feeble-mindedness or a psychosis. 
‘In addition to all this information about the subject 
himself, we must learn what we can about his immediate 
family. What is the economic status or occupation of the 
parents? Have any brothers, sisters, aunts, or uncles 
feeble-mindedness, epilepsy, insanity, alcoholism, syphilis, 
tuberculosis? If any or many of these diseases or defects 
appear in near relatives, there is much more chance that 
they will appear also in the subject. 
1Too much reliance must not be placed upon the name of the subject’s 
position as an indicator of mental ability. At the Psychopathic Hospital in 
Boston, several physicians objected to the diagnosis of feeble-mindedness in 
one case on the ground that a feeble-minded clerk could not possibly give 
satisfaction. The questioning was then directed toward his activities in the 
store and the following dialogue took place. Examiner: “If sugar costs 
9 cents a pound, how much would 11 pounds cost?” Patient: ‘I don’t 
know.” Examiner: “Then how would you know how much to charge a 
customer for it?” Patient: ‘Why that’s easy, just weigh the sugar on the 
scales and then read down the column for 11 cents till you come to the 
place that tells you.” Examiner: “How much is 42 from 50?” Patient: 
“T don’t know.” Examiner: ‘But if someone bought a pound of butter at 
42 cents and gave you 50 cents, how much change would you give him? 
Patient: “Why take 42, and 1 cent is 43, and another is 44, and another is 
45, and a nickel is 50.’ We see, then, that this clerk could add and could 
read numbers from the scale, but was unable to perform more complicated 
mathematics, and was, therefore, lower in mentality than his work would 
suggest.

When all this information has been collected with or 
without the aid of psychiatrist and social worker, the 
psychologist may be of great value in getting the subject 
into the most suitable place in society (school grade, special 
legal status, occupation, etc.). 
We present below (pp. 28, 29) the form of record blank 
used in the Pre-adolescent Point Scale. 
Directions ror Givinc AND ScorInc THE SEPARATE 
TESTS 
Test 1. Aesthetic Comparison.—The three pairs of Binet 
pictures (figures 1 and 2) constitute the materials for this 
test. In figure 1 the pairs (a), (b), and (c) are arranged 
as they are ordinarily used in the Binet scale: in figure 2 
the positions of the members of the pairs are reversed. 
With a sheet of paper or cardboard or even merely the 
examiner’s left hand over pairs (b) and (c), present pair (a) 
of figure 1 to the subject, asking ‘‘ Which is the prettier of 
these two faces?” (If the prettier is unintelligible, ask 
“which is the prettiest?”’; if still you are not understood, 
ask ‘Which do you like best (or better)?’ Record the sub- 
ject’s judgment, and immediately expose pair (b), repeating 
the question. The same procedure is followed for pair (c). 
If all of the judgments have been incorrect, the test may be 
considered failed, but if some or all have been correct, the 
examiner should turn to figure 2 and repeat the procedure. 
Two correct judgments are required for a success in any 
of the parts, whereas one incorrect judgment in either trial 
constitutes a failure. The two correct judgments are 
demanded for each part of this test in order to avoid the 
possibility of correct answers through chance or guessing. 
Scoring.—Credit of 1 point is given’ for success in each of 
the three parts of the test (for each pair of correct judg- 
ments). Thus, the highest possible score for the test is 3. 
Remarks.—The most common failure in the test comes in 
the comparison of the third pair of faces. 
Test 2. Missing Parts.—The four Binet pictures (figures 
3 and 4) are used in this test. Present the figure of a

of awoman?” If the subject obviously fails to understand 
“missing,” say ‘The woman is not all there. What part of 
her is gone?” If the subject responds ‘‘hands’”’ or “‘arms” 
pass on to the next part of the test; but if, instead, he says 
“Nhat,” ask ‘‘What else?” If again he replies incorrectly, 
consider the attempt a failure and pass on to the next pic- 
ture (figure 4). With the faces (c) and (d) of figure 4 
covered, present face (b), asking ‘‘What is missing in this 
face?” If the subject replies ‘‘an ear” ask “‘What else?” 
If to this he replies incorrectly, pass on to. the next part 
of the test. Present face (c), keeping face (d) covered, 
repeating the question ‘‘ What is missing in this face?” As 
in part (6), give two chances and no more. Present next, 
in like manner, face (d). 
Scoring.—The correct responses for these four missing 
part questions are: ‘‘arms” or ‘‘hands,” ‘‘eye”’ or ‘‘eyes,” 
“mouth,” and ‘‘nose.” Credit of 1 point should be given 
for each correct response. Thus, the highest possible score 
for the test is 4. 
Remarks.—In this test fewest failures are made in part 
(a), and most in part (c). 
Test 3. Comparison of Lines and Weights.—The mate- 
rials for this test are the card with the two lines, 5 and 6 
centimeters long, respectively, by 1 millimeter wide and 3 
centimeters apart (figure 5) and the set of four weighted 
blocks 22 millimeters in their several dimensions and weigh- 
ing respectively 3, 6, 12 and 15 grams. 
(a) Present the lines with the longer one above, saying 
to the subject “‘ Which is the longer (or longest) of these two 
lines?” If the answer is incorrect, proceed no farther; 
but if correct, remove the page from view, turn it upside 
down, and present it to the child with the longer line below, 
saying ‘‘ Which is the longer of these lines?” 
Scoring.—Give no credit if the subject fails on either the 
first or second trial. If both trials are given correctly, 
give credit of 1 point.

(b) The examiner next places before the subject the 
two blocks weighing 3 and 12 grams, respectively, leaving 
a space of about 5 centimeters between them, and saying 
“Which is the heavier of these two blocks?” If the subject 
merely points to a block and says ‘‘This one,” ask ‘‘ How 
do you know?” and if he still hesitates to touch them say 
“You may touch them if you wish to.” Beyond this, by way 
of encouragement or suggestion, the examiner must not go. 
He must carefully avoid suggesting by word or act the 
lifting of the weights as a method of comparing them, but 
he may say ‘‘You may touch them if you wish to,” since 
otherwise certain young children may think that it is not 
allowable for them to touch the cubes. If the subject 
responds incorrectly, pass on to part (c); if the subject 
responds correctly by lifting the weights and selecting the 
heavier one, the blocks should be shielded from the child’s 
sight, reversed in position, and a second trial given. In 
precisely the same manner, the blocks weighing respectively 
6 and 15 grams should be presented for either one or two 
judgments according to the nature of the first response. 
Scoring for Parts (b) and (c).—If the subject fails in either 
the first or second trial for part (6) give no credit: if he 
succeeds for both trials of part (b), give credit of 1 point. 
Similarly if either trial for part (c) is failed give no credit; 
but if both trials are successful, give credit of 1 point. 
Thus, the highest possible score for test 3 is 3 points, one 
each for the three parts. 
Remarks.—The easiest part of this test is part (a). If 
either (6) or (c) is failed, both are likely to be failed. 
Test 4. Memory Span for Digits.—The materials used 
for this test are presented in full on the record blank, and 
they are also reproduced below.

DIRECTIONS FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 31 
The examiner should say “Listen, and repeat exactly 
' what I say.” He should then distinctly and at the rate of 
two digits per second, in a perfectly monotonous tone, 
repeat the digits under trial 1, part (a),—‘‘3, 7, 4.” He 
then pauses for the subject’s response. If the subject fails 
to grasp the idea and makes no response, he should be told 
again to listen carefully and say just what the experimenter 
says. Then the same group should be re-presented. If 
the subject attempts to repeat them but makes a mistake, 
he is given a second chance under trial 2 of (a), with the 
digits ‘5, 8, 1.” If the subject repeats this second group 
correctly, the experimenter immediately passes on to the 
group of four digits, trial 1 of (6)—‘‘2, 9, 4, 7.” If the sub- 
ject fails in both trials for any given number of digits, the 
test is discontinued. 
Scoring.—Credit of 1 point is given for each part in which 
the subject succeeds on either trial until a part is reached 
where both trials are failed. On this part a credit of 0 is 
given and 0 is given to the succeeding parts, without trying 
them. Thus, if the subject passes the first trial of part (a), 
he is credited 1 point and given the first trial of part (6), 
if this trial is failed the second trial is offered; if the second 
trial is passed, credit of 1 is given and the first trial of part 
(c) is given. Then if both trials of (c) are failed, the test is 
discontinued and a 0 score is given to parts (c), (d) and (e), 
giving a total score for the test of 2. The highest possible 
score for this test is 5. 
Test 5. Counting Backward.—For this test, no printed 
material is necessary. Say to the subject, “I wish you to 
count backward from 20 to 1 like this, 25, 24, 28, 22, 21”— 
at this point pause and wait for the subject to continue the 
counting. If he is unable to make a start, the experimenter 
should himself continue “20, 19, 18, 17, 16”—and pause 
again to give the subject an opportunity to take up the 
counting. If once more the subject fails to make a start, 
the experimenter should continue ‘15, 14, 18, 12, 11”— 
when again he pauses for a few seconds. If the subject is 
still incapable of response,;the examiner should count 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  32 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
“10, 9, 8, 7, 6”—and once more pause to give the subject 
a chance. If, after taking up the counting at any point, 
the subject makes a single mistake (reversal or omission), 
he should be asked to repeat. No second trial should be 
offered if more than one mistake is made in any section 
(from 20 to 16, or from 15 to 11, etce.). Not over thirty 
seconds should be allowed the subject for counting 
backward. 
Scoring.—Ilf the subject takes up the counting at 20 
and proceeds without mistake, or with a single error, later 
corrected, to 1, 4 points credit should be given. If the 
mistake is not corrected, he should be credited with correct 
response for counting from the next multiple of 5 below his 
mistake. For example, if the count is “20, 18, 19, 17, 16,” 
and so on correctly to 1, and this mistake is made likewise 
in the second trial, the subject is credited with 3 points 
for counting correctly from 15 to 1. If he counts correctly 
only from 10 to 1, he receives 2 points credit, and if only 
from 5 to 1, 1 point credit. Thus, the highest possible 
score, for this test is 4. 
Remarks.—In most cases, the score on counting back- 
wards will be found to be either 4 or 0, that is, if the child 
can count backwards at all, he can usually count from 20 
to 1; but there is some probability that between approxi- 
mately mental age 6 and mental age 9 partial credit will be 
received. 
Test 6. Repetition of Sentences.—For this test, the 
materials appear on the record blank and they are also 
given below. They consist of four sentences as follows: 
(a) It rains. I am hungry. 
(b) His name is John. It is a very fine day. 
(c) The sun is very large and red. Our train was more 
than two hours late. 
(d) It is not necessary to hurt the poor little birds. It is 
night and all the world rests in sleep. 
In this test the examiner should say ‘Listen carefully 
and repeat just what I say.” He should be sure that the 
subject is attending and should then read (or repeat)
-P-A-G-E-41
  DIRECTIONS FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 33 
slowing and distinctly the sentences under (a). If for any 
reason the subject fails to make any response, (a) should be 
read again and a second chance thus given him to get 
started. In case of failure to repeat (a) correctly, the 
examiner should present the sentences under (b), and if 
failure occurs in this part also, the test should be discon- 
tinued. If part (c) is failed, do not present part (d). The 
substitution of ‘‘is” for ‘‘was” in this part does not count 
as failure since the two words are so easily confused unless 
the examiner accents the verb in an unnatural manner. 
Scoring.—For perfect repetition of (a), 1 point credit is 
given; for perfect repetition of (b), likewise 1 point credit; 
for perfect repetition of (c) or for repetition perfect except 
for the substitution of ‘‘is’”’ for ‘‘was,’”’ 2 points credit; and 
for perfect repetition of (d), 2 points credit. Thus, the 
highest score for the test is 6. 
' Test 7. Description of Three Binet Pictures.—In this 
test the three Binet pictures. (figures 6, 7 and 8) are used. 
The examiner should present picture (a) (figure 6) saying 
“Please look at this picture and tell me about it.” The form 
of statement is particularly important. If the examiner 
says ‘Look at this picture and tell me what you see,” 
enumeration rather than description or interpretation is 
likely to be obtained from the young child. In response to 
the examiner’s request “‘ Please look at this picture and tell 
me about it,” the subject may enumerate the parts of the 
picture, may describe it in terms of composition or action, 
or may interpret it in terms of meaning or purpose. 
When the subject has responded as best he can to picture 
(a) and the experimenter has recorded the response in as 
great detail as he can without interrupting the examination 
with a long pause, picture (6) (figure 7) is presented with a 
repetition of the request “‘ Please look at this picture and 
tell me about it.”” This in due course is followed by picture 
(c) (figure 8). 
Scoring.—For simple enumeration, whether all articles 
are named correctly or not, give 1 point credit. As for 
example in (6), subjects will sometimes say “two men” 
3
-P-A-G-E-42
34 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
or ‘two women” instead of aman and awoman. For sim- 
ple description, statements about the position of persons or 
objects, statements of color, or any statement concerning 
anything that can be seen, give 2 points. For a ‘‘story”’ 
about the picture, any statement that implies any sense 
other than sight (as, for example, statements of tempera- 
ture, or sound), statements about anything that has hap- 
pened before or is to happen after the moment at which 
the picture is taken, statements concerning the feelings of 
persons, or of the relationship between persons, give 3 
points. 
Thus for picture 7 (a), credit of 3 would be given to the 
. following answers: ‘‘Manand boy. He’s pulling that cart, 
got it loaded with something, pulling hard.” ‘‘Man try- 
ing to pull it up.” “‘Ain’t got no horse.” ‘‘Looks as if it 
was going to tip over.” ‘Raining. Boy’s father pulling 
load of furniture up hill.” ‘‘Peddler’s cart. Man sells 
things. Boy helps him.’ ‘“‘Have no horse. Must be 
kind of poor, in war, bringing their furniture with them. 
Neither look very intelligent.” ‘‘Heavy load. Men 
tired.” ‘Seem to be moving.” 
Credit of 2: ‘‘Man and boy dragging cart.” ‘Hay or 
something in team. Two men pulling it,’ “Pulling cart 
up. It’s kind of tipping over. Manand boy.” “Pulling 
load of furniture on wagon.” 
Credit of 1: ‘‘Manand boy.” ‘‘Man and boy, furniture 
baskets, rain, post, tables.” 
Picture 7 (b). Credit of 3: ‘‘Man sleeping, lady think- 
ing.” ‘‘He’s sick or dying, she is taking hold of his arm.” 
“People look poor.” ‘That lady shouldn’t be there.” 
“Man must be dead.” ‘‘Man looks as if he was trying to 
help that woman.’ “Man and woman side of the road. 
Man older than woman.” ‘She looks cold.” ‘Man 
making love on a settee.” ‘‘Man lost his hat.” ‘‘Man 
looks dead. Must be his daughter.” ‘‘Must be without 
a home, poor, man sick. Woman trying to tell what is the 
matter with him, both sad.” ‘‘Out of work, hungry, poor.” 
“Man sleeping.”
-P-A-G-E-43
  DIRECTIONS FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 35 
Credit of 2: ‘‘Sitting down on a settee.” ‘Lady sitting 
on a settee. Man side of her.” ‘‘Lady and man. Lady 
holding on to man’s arms.” “In a park. Old man and 
woman sitting on a bench. Hat on ground.” 
Credit of 1: ‘Man and woman, trees, and snow.’ 
“Man and lady.” 
Doubtful case: ‘‘Lady and grandfather.” When given 
by an older child “grandfather” may very well be interpre- 
tation, but when given by a young child, it is probably used 
merely as the name of any old man. In cases where the 
child’s meaning is not absolutely clear, do not grade this 
part until parts (a) and (c) have been graded. Then if 
interpretation is given for those pictures, count ‘‘grand- 
father” as interpretation, but if the other pictures are 
merely enumeration, then “grandfather” should be con- 
sidered as enumeration. 
Picture 7 (c). Credit of 3: ‘Standing up to see in a 
house where they are camping out.” ‘Looking out window 
for someone.” ‘‘Watching to see if his wife is coming 
home.” ‘‘Prisoned in.” ‘He fell asleep standing up.” 
“Peeking out the window.” ‘‘Standing up. Lonesome. 
Looking out the window.” ‘‘Standing as if saying prayers.” 
Credit of 2: “Standing up looking out of window.” 
“Man looking in a glass.” ‘‘Climbing up a tree.” ‘‘Fix- 
ing the window.” ‘Man reading.” 
Credit of 1: “‘Man, chair, box, two tables.” ‘‘ Telephone, 
chair, book.” 
Remarks.—In part (a) the most frequent description is 
“Man and boy pulling wagon” and the most frequent 
interpretation is some comment on the lack of a horse. 
In part (6), the most common description is ‘‘Man and 
lady sitting on settee” and the most common interpretation 
is ‘man asleep.”’ In part (c), “‘standing up” and “‘look- 
ing out the window” are practically the only descriptions 
and ‘‘in prison” practically the only interpretation. 
Test 8. Arranging Cubes According to Their Weight.— 
For this test the materials are the five wooden cubes, of 
which four were used in test 3.
-P-A-G-E-44
36 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
The examiner should shuffle the cubes and place them on 
the table before the subject within easy reach, and should 
say ‘These little blocks are all the same size, but they weigh 
different amounts. I wish you to place the heaviest one here 
and next to it, here, the one which is just a little less heavy: 
and then, here, the one which is a little less heavy than that; and 
then the one still a little less heavy; and finally, here, the 
lightest one of all.’’ While saying these words, the examiner 
should point to the position on the table where each block 
belongs. It is essential to give this explicit form of direc- 
tion to young children, whereas for older children or adults, 
it is necessary to say only, ‘I wish you to arrange these 
blocks in order of weight, beginning with the heaviest one, 
here, and placing the lightest one here, at the opposite end of 
the series.” 
If the arrangement first made is not correct, a second 
trial should be given, and the subject should be cautioned 
to be careful and not to hurry too much. 
Scoring.—Credit of 2 points is given for a correct arrange- 
ment in either trial, and 1 point if in either trial the only 
error is the interchanging of two consecutive blocks. 
Thus, 1 point would be given for the arrangement 6, 3, 9, 
12, 15, or for the arrangement 3, 6, 12, 9, 15; but no credit 
would be given for 6, 3, 12, 9, 15. 
Remarks.—Errors are somewhat more apt to occur 
between weights 3 and 6 than between the other consecutive 
weights. The reason for this is not clear, since, according 
to Weber’s law, we should expect this pair to be most 
easily discriminated. 
Test 9. Comparison of Three Pairs of Objects.—No 
printed material is necessary for this test. 
1 In order to avoid showing the subject that the blocks are numbered, it is 
often best to move the row of blocks as arranged by the subject nearer the 
examiner, and to ask the next question immediately. While the subject is 
occupied with answering it is a simple matter to tip the row of blocks over 
and read the numbers from the underneath sides, without attracting the 
attention of the subject. Then, if there has been an error, they may be 
tipped up again, shuffled and again presented for arrangement.
-P-A-G-E-45
DIRECTIONS FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 37 
The examiner should say, ‘“‘ You know what an apple is 
and you know what a banana is? Tell me how they are 
different from one another.” 
In the same way questions are asked for wood and glass, 
and for paper and cloth. 
Many children are satisfied when they have given one 
point of difference, such as, for example ‘‘ An apple is round 
and a banana is long” or ‘‘An apple is red and a banana 
is yellow.” In such instances the examiner should say, 
in order to make certain that the child is unable to go 
farther ‘‘What other differences are there?” He should 
not, in any case, give other aid or encouragement than this. 
Scoring.—Give credit of 1 point for one correct point of 
difference, in the case of each pair of objects, and 2 points 
for two or more correct points of difference, in the case of 
each pair. Thus the total possible score for the entire test 
is 6. 
Give credit for such differences as: 
(a): “Apple round, banana long.” “Apple red, banana 
yellow.’”’ ‘Apple sometimes red, sometimes green, banana 
sometimes yellow, sometimes red.” ‘‘Apple harder than 
banana.” “You peel a banana with your fingers, have to 
peel apple with knife.” ‘Banana sweeter than apple.” 
“You can eat the skin of an apple, can’t of a banana.” 
“Skin of a banana is thicker.’ ‘Can get banana all the 
year, apple only part of the year.’’ ‘Apple has stem, 
banana doesn’t.” ‘Apple has core, banana doesn’t.” 
“Bananas grow in bunches, apples don’t.” ‘Apple is 
juicier than a banana.” ‘Apple weighs more than a 
banana.” “‘Apple grows in cold climate, banana in warm.” 
‘‘Make cider of apples, not of bananas.’ “Apples easier to 
digest.” 
(6) Give credit for such differences as: ‘‘Glass is trans- 
parent, wood is not.” ‘‘Wood grows, glass is made.’’ 
“Use wood for houses, etc., glass for windows, ete.’ 
“Wood gets softer in water, glass does not.” “Glass is 
more expensive than wood.” ‘‘ Wood is brown, glass is no 
color (or white).’”’ ‘Glass generally comes in a flat sheet,  
-P-A-G-E-46
  
38 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
wood in blocks.” ‘‘Wood has bark, glass doesn’t.” 
“Wood is generally painted or varnished, glass isn’t.’ 
“Can drive nails into wood, can’t into glass.” 
(c) Give eredit for such differences as: “Paper tears 
more easily than cloth.” ‘‘Cloth is woven, paper is 
pressed.” ‘“‘You can write on paper, can’t on cloth.” 
“Can sew on cloth, can’t on paper.”’ ‘Cloth is for clothes, 
paper for wrapping.”’ ‘‘Paper is generally smoother than 
cloth.” ‘Cloth is more expensive than paper.” ‘Cloth 
washes, paper doesn’t.” ‘Cloth is generally thicker than 
paper.” ‘‘Paper is made from wood or rags, cloth from 
threads.”’ ‘‘When you crumple up cloth, can smooth it out 
again, can’t paper.’’ ‘‘Paper burns more easily than 
cloth.” 
Give no credit for ‘Paper is white and cloth is white.” 
“You can write on paper, well, you can write on cloth too.” 
Doubtful.— Apple is red. Banana is long.’ If the sub- 
ject implies the opposite, give credit. (This happens ‘often 
with average adults.) If the opposite is not implied, do 
not give credit. This answer of course does not show as 
logical train of thought as when the differences are paired 
off. Count such as ‘‘ You can write on paper, and you can 
sew on cloth” as one difference,—that of use; but count 
“You can write on paper and you can’t on cloth. You 
can sew on cloth, but not on paper,” as two differences.” 
Remarks.—The differences between apple and banana 
most commonly given are: shape, color, kind or size of seeds, 
method of peeling, and the edibility of the skin. The 
differences between wood and glass most frequently given 
are: transparency, use, ease with which it is broken, and 
inflammability. The differences between paper and cloth 
most frequently given are: use, ease with which it is torn, 
possibility of writing on it, and possibility of sewing it. 
From this we see that the differences most commonly 
given are those of appearance and use. Differences in use 
are not given for the apple and banana, since the use of the 
two is the same; similarly, differences in appearance are 
not given for paper and cloth.

Test 10. Definitions of Concrete Terms.—The terms 
which are to be defined are printed on the record blank and 
are: (a) spoon; (b) chair; (c) horse; (d) baby. 
The examiner should ask “‘ What is a spoon?” then pause 
for the subject’s reply, record, and then proceed to ask, 
similarly, ‘‘ What is a chair?” and so on. 
Scoring.—General rules for scoring this test are to give 
full credit (2 points) for classification, or for detailed 
description; and to give half credit (1 point) for definitions 
in terms of use, or in terms of some attribute of the object 
as ‘‘baby cries,” or for words which are practically synony- 
mous, as “infant,” or ‘‘rocking chair,” or for meagre 
description. 
The highest possible score for this test is 8. 
(a) Give full credit (2) for ‘‘Silverware.” ‘Piece of 
silver.” ‘Article used to eat with.” ‘Instrument used 
to eat with.” ‘Long and round at top, cylindrical, use to 
eat with and to measure by.” Give half credit (1): 
“What you eat out of.” “Stir things with.” ‘‘Silver.” 
“Tin.” “You can eat from it. It is silver.” ‘‘Little 
lead thing.” ‘‘Round.” 
(b) Give full credit (2) for ‘‘ Piece of furniture.” ‘Wood 
ware.”’ ‘Article yousit on.” ‘Four legs and four rounds, 
back and seat to sit on.’ ‘Wooden object.’’ Give half 
credit (1) for ‘‘What you sit on.” ‘‘ Have four legs, sit on.” 
“Wood.” ‘Made of wood, four legs.’ ‘Wooden chair 
with soft cushions.” ‘‘One kind of chair is different, 
rocking-chair.” ‘‘ Rocking-chair.” 
(c) Give full credit (2) for ‘‘Animal.” ‘‘Domestic 
animal.” ‘‘Quadruped.” ‘Beast of burden.” ‘Four 
legs, tail, two eyes, mouth and nose that eats.” Give half 
credit (1) for ‘‘What you drive.” ‘To ride on a team.” 
“Four legs, ears.” ‘‘What ploughs and does farm work.” 
“To work with.” 
(d) Give full credit (2) for ‘‘Creature, two legs, and head 
just like we are.” ‘Human being.” ‘Small child.” 
“Child under three or four years.” ‘‘Little girl or boy.’ 
Give half credit (1) for “What you rock.” ‘‘Crying.”
-P-A-G-E-48
  40 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
“Small and horse is bigger.” ‘Infant.’ ‘‘To creep on 
floor.” ‘To care for.’’ ‘Little boy to your mother.” 
“Grows up, gets big all the time.” ‘Nurse to look after 
the baby.” ‘Belongs to a mother.” 
Remarks.—In cases where partial credit is given, the most 
common definitions are in terms of use (or in case of 
“baby” statements such as ‘‘you rock,” “cries,” etc.) and 
the next most common half-credit definitions are definitions 
of the material of which the object is made. 
Test 11. Resistance of Visual Suggestion.—The mate- 
rials for this test consist of the six pairs of lines presented 
in figures 9 to 14. In each case the members of a pair are 
separated by a distance of 1 centimeter. The lines are 
approximately 1 millimeter in width. The measurements 
for the several pairs are as follows: pair (a), lefthand 
member 4 centimeters (cm.), righthand member 5 cm.; pair 
(b) 5 cm. and 6 cm., respectively; pair (c), 6 cm. and 7 cm. 
respectively ; pairs (d), (e), and (f), 7 em. and 7 cm. 
As the experimenter presents pair (a) he asks ‘“‘ Which is 
the longer of these two lines?” THe notes the response, pre- 
ferably remembering rather than stopping to record it, 
turns immediately to pair (b) and repeats his question. He 
next presents pair (c) again repeating the question in pre- 
cisely the same way. Without delay, he next presents pair 
(d) changing the form of the question to ‘‘and of these” repeat- 
ing the same question for pairs (e) and (f). The subject’s 
judgment in the case of each of the six pairs should be 
recorded. 
If any one of the judgments for the first three pairs of 
lines (a), (6), (c) is incorrect, the test should be discon- 
tinued. 
Scoring.—lf an error is made in pair (a), (b) or (c), a 
score of 0 should be given. If, in case of the pairs of lines 
(d), (e), (f), the subject replies that the lefthand member 
of the pair instead of the righthand member is longer, or 
if he says they are equal, 1 point credit is given for each 
the three pairs. That is, 1 point credit is given for each 
resistance of the suggestion, from the first three pairs of
-P-A-G-E-49
DIRECTIONS FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE Al 
lines, that the righthand member of the pair is longer. 
Thus, the highest possible total score for the test is 3. 
We have noted that various examiners misunderstand 
this test and give it wrongly. They often give credit for 
the judgments concerning (a), (b), and (c). We therefore 
call special attention to the directions and emphasize the 
need of a thorough understanding of the purpose of the test 
in order to give it correctly and properly evaluate the 
results. 
Test 12. Copying a Square and a Diamond.—For this 
test the materials, consisting of a square, 4 centimeters 
(cm.) on the side (inside measurement) with lines 1 milli- 
meter (mm.) wide; and a diamond 5 cm. on the side (inside 
measurement) with lines 1 mm. wide are presented in figures 
15 and 17. 
The experimenter proceeds with part (a), figure 15 of 
the test, by turning the record sheet face down before the 
child, and then placing the square just above it, saying 
“Please draw on the back of the record sheet with this pencil 
a figure just like the one before you,” and point to the square. 
It is, of course, absolutely necessary, if comparable results 
are to be obtained, that the square be placed directly in 
front of the subject, so that he does not get a distorted 
image of it. 
As soon as the square has been completed, the experi- 
menter should proceed with part (6) of the test by present- 
ing part (0), the diamond, with the repetition of his former 
request in precisely the same words. It is essential that 
the figure of the diamond be placed squarely before the 
subject with the orientation which it has in figure 17. 
Scoring.—(a) Give full credit (2) for any figure which 
shows approximate equality of both lines and angles: 1 
point for any figure which shows approximate equality of 
angles but not of lines, and 1 point for any figure which 
shows approximate equality of lines but not of angles; for 
anything poorer, no credit should be given. 
(b) Give full credit (2) for any figure which shows 
approximate equality of both pairs of opposite angles; and
-P-A-G-E-50
  42 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
1 point for any figure which shows approximate equality 
of only one pair of opposite angles; no credit should be 
given for anything which is indistinguishable from the 
square or unidentifiable really as a diamond. 
Examples of common types of drawings, and their 
scoring are given in figures 16 and 18. 
Test 13. Free Association—The only materials used 
in this test are the examples. These the examiner should 
commit to memory thoroughly, so that he can give them 
quickly, surely, and without reference to the printed page. 
The examiner should say to the subject. ‘‘I wish you 
to say all the words that you can think of in three minutes. 
When I say ‘“‘ready”’ you begin and say as many words as 
you can before I tell you to stop. Say such words as pin, 
table, grass, trees, clouds, horse, dog, brook. All ready! 
Begin.” With either a stop-watch or the second-hand of 
an ordinary watch to guide him, the experimenter keeps 
track of the passage of time, while recording, in the space 
for the appropriate half-minute on the record sheet, a 
stroke for each word uttered. If the child stops, as though 
assuming that enough words had been given, at the end of 
a half-minute period the experimenter should say, “Go on, 
please” and he should repeat this if necessary, at the end 
of each half-minute of the three-minute period. Repeated 
words, if recorded the second time, should be indicated by 
a dot above the stroke. But it is even more convenient to 
omit them entirely, and it is a great advantage in counting 
the words if the strokes are grouped in fives by crossing 
each successive group of four. 
Especially important in this test is the giving of the same 
words as examples and the stimulation or attraction of 
attention to the task, if necessary, at the end of each half- 
minute. 
If the child starts giving memorized lists such as ‘‘one, 
two, three, four, etc.” or ‘‘ Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, 
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,’ he should be 
stopped and told to give separate words. It may even 
be necessary with some children to remind them of the “
-P-A-G-E-51
DIRECTIONS FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 43 
kind wanted by repeating once more ‘‘pin, table, ete.” It 
is obviously unfair to credit a child for each word given if 
he names lists or recites poetry, etc. 
Scoring.—Credit is given for words and phrases (except 
in the case of repetitions) as follows: 1 point credit for 
from 30 to 44 words, inclusive; 2 points for from 45 to 59 
words, inclusive; 3 points credit for from 60 to 74; and 4 
points for 75 and upward. 
Test 14. The Use of Three Given Words in One 
Sentence.—If the examiner has prepared the examining 
cards with black gummed letters as was suggested (p. 16), 
then he should use the card bearing the words ‘‘ Boston (or 
the name of the town in which the child lives) money, river.” 
If he has not prepared such a card, then he should write the 
words plainly on the back of the record sheet. 
He should then show the words to the subject, read them 
aloud twice and say ‘‘I wish you to make one sentence in 
which the three words Boston, money, and river are used.” 
The examiner must make perfectly certain that the subject 
understands the three words and knows what is meant by 
a sentence. We have found it best to assume at first 
that the subject does know what is meant by a sentence, for 
many children will grasp the meaning from the context of 
the request; if we begin the test by asking ‘‘ You know what 
a sentence is, do you not?” it is not at all uncommon to 
have a certain type of child say ‘‘You mean thirty days?” 
and thus necessitate the statement that there are two kinds 
of sentences, etc. The subject should also grasp the fact 
that one, not two or more sentences, is required. This 
fact can usually be conveyed by the emphasis which the 
examiner gives the words. The sentence need not be 
written by the subject unless he prefers to do so but should 
be recorded by the examiner. 
Scoring.—Full credit (4 points) for a single sentence 
containing all three words when the sentence does not 
have verbs connected by ‘‘and.”” If the verbs are con- 
nected by ‘‘and,”’ give full credit if the connection of the 
sense is very close. ‘‘Boston” may be used as an adjective. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
The sentence does not have to be true. Examples of 
sentences receiving full credit are: ‘‘I am going to Boston 
to spend some money on the river.” ‘‘I went to Boston 
to see the pretty river and spent most of my money.” “I 
lost some money in the river going through Boston.” ‘I 
went to Boston shopping and had enough money left to 
go on the Charles river canoeing.”’ ‘‘The Boston money 
works is near a river.” 
Give credit of 2 points if the three words are used in two 
separate sentences or in sentences very loosely connected, 
as “‘I went to Boston to see my father to get some money 
and I saw someone fall in the river.” ‘‘ Boston is a money- 
making place and which a river passes near.’’ ‘‘To go to 
Boston you have to have money and you cross the Charles 
river.” ‘Boston has got a lot of money in the state and 
the river is out in the ocean.” ‘I am going to Boston to 
get some money next week; I am going to the river today.” 
Give no credit when the three words are used in three 
sentences or when only two of the words are used, as “I 
went to Boston one day to spend money.” ‘I go to 
Boston and bring money and saw a lady fall in the river.” 
Test 15, Comprehension of Questions.—The materials 
for this test are the following four questions, each of which 
is indicated by two or three words on the record blank: (a) 
If you were going away and missed your train, what would 
you do? (b) If someone has been unkind to you and says 
he is sorry, what should you do? (c) Why should you judge 
a person by what he does rather than by what he says? (d) 
Why do we more readily forgive an unkind act done in anger 
than one done without anger. 
The examiner should repeat the question (a) slowly and 
distinctly twice, and then encourage the subject, if neces- 
sary, to make some reply. The answer should be recorded 
on the record blank either in full or in substance. The 
examiner should in like manner present questions (b), (c), 
and (d). 
Scoring.—General rules: Give full credit (2) for full 
logical answers; and for incomplete answers in some cases
-P-A-G-E-53
  DIRECTIONS FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 45 
where the remainder is implied, as for (c) ‘‘Can see what 
they do.” Give half credit (1) for answers which show 
some slight grasp on the whole situation. 
(a) Full credit (2): “Look for another train. Wait at 
depot.” ‘Take electric car.’ ‘‘Ask what time the next 
train went.” ‘Take a taxi.’ ‘Telephone.’ Half credit 
(1): ““Go any place at all.” ‘‘Have to stay there.” 
“Wait till it comes back.” ‘‘Take a watch and see how 
many minutes.” ‘Go home.” No credit: ‘“‘Run for it.” 
“Hurry.” ‘Go to Boston.” 
(6) Full credit (2): ‘Forgive them.” ‘Pardon them.’ 
“Be nice to them.” ‘Tell them all right and not do it 
again.” ‘‘Do to them as you’d like them to do to you.” 
“Make up with them again.” Half credit (1): ‘Serve 
them back.” ‘Go up and tell them you feel the same.” 
“Like them.” ‘‘Say welcome.” ‘‘Do nothing.” ‘Let 
them go.” ‘Pay no attention to them.” 
No credit: “Thank you.” ‘Apologize.’ ‘Be sorry 
to them.” ‘Take it back.” 
(c) Full credit (2): ‘He don’t mean all he says.” 
“Things he did more accountable than what he says. 
Perhaps what he’d tell you wouldn’t be true.” ‘Can tell 
by their actions and by the way they say it whether they 
mean it or not.’ ‘‘Might do something he said he wasn’t 
going to.” ‘Can see what they do.” Half credit (1): 
“You can judge people by their actions, can tell by what 
they do.” ‘Actions speak louder than words.” ‘‘When he 
acts it, it shows more gratitude.”’ ‘‘He does more than he 
says.” No credit: “‘Cause he’s disagreeable.” ‘Should 
judge him in his ways.” ‘‘See for yourself what he does, 
can mostly tell when a person is all right, and when they’re 
in wrong.” ‘Supposed to do the right thing.” ‘‘Shouldn’t 
judge them at all.” 
(d) Full credit (2): “‘Think they don’t mean it, they’re 
in such a temper.” ‘‘When they did it, they didn’t stop 
to think; when they’re not in anger, they plan to do it.” 
Half credit (1): “‘When they mean a thing, don’t forgive 
them.”’ No credit: ““Because they apologize and think 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  46 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
more of it.” ‘One might be done by accident; one with 
anger means to doit.” ‘‘ Better to do things without anger.” 
Test 16. Drawing Designs from Memory.—The materials 
for this test are the two Binet designs given in figure 19. 
The examiner should say to the subject, ‘I am going to 
show you two drawings. After you have looked at them, I 
shall take them away and ask you to draw both of them from 
memory. You must look at them carefully because you will 
see them for only fifteen seconds, and that is a very short time.” 
The examiner then places the back of the record sheet 
before the subject, and presents the designs in the orienta- 
tion indicated by the figure, and with either a stop-watch 
or the second-hand of an ordinary watch, determines 
properly the interval of exposure. The subject is then 
immediately given a pencil to reproduce the designs on the 
record sheet. 
Scoring.—Figures 20 and 21 give typical reproductions 
and their evaluation. In general, credit of 2 points is given 
for each correct reproduction even although the lines of the 
drawing are irregular. For imperfect reproductions, such 
as those in which the rectangle is placed in the center of the 
prism section, figure 20, or the small squares of design (0) 
turned outward, instead of inward, figure 21, 1 point credit is 
given. Nocreditisgiven for anything poorer than the above. 
Remarks.—The most common error in the first drawing 
is to draw the figure as a cube. The reason for this is 
apparently that the subjects name the figure a ‘“‘box” and 
then afterward draw the ordinary figure of a box. Types 
of drawings given by the insane are reproduced in figure 24. 
Test 17. Criticisms of Absurd Statements.—The follow- 
ing five absurd statements constitute the material for this 
test: 
(a) We met a finely-dressed gentleman. He was walking 
along the street with his hands in his pockets and swinging 
his cane. 
(b) An unlucky bicycle rider fell on his head and was in- 
stantly killed; they took him to the hospital and fear he cannot 
get well.  
-P-A-G-E-55
  DIRECTIONS FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE AT 
(c) A little boy said: ‘I have three brothers, Paul, Ernest, 
and myself.” 
(d) At the crossroads was a guide post with the following 
directions: Boston, three miles and a half; if you can’t read, 
inquire at the blacksmith shop. 
(e) It has been found that the last car of a, train is damaged 
most in case of accident. It, therefore, would be better to 
leave off the last car. 
The examiner should proceed by saying, “J am going to 
read some sentences to you. In each one of them there is 
something foolish or absurd.” (He should make sure 
that the child understands what is meant by ‘“‘foolish”’ 
or by “‘absurd.”’) ‘‘Listen carefully, and tell me each time 
what it is that is foolish.’ He should then repeat (a) slowly 
and distinctly twice and ask, ‘‘Now what is foolish about 
that?”’ So, in turn, each of the five parts of the test should 
be presented and the subject’s response recorded in as 
great detail as is practicable. 
After a reply has been made, it is safest to question a 
subject, especially if a young child, to make sure that he 
really appreciates the absurdity. For example the child 
may reply to question (c) “myself,” and in answer to 
further questioning may say that the speaker should have 
used his own name. This, of course, indicates that he 
does not appreciate the absurdity. 
Scoring.—No partial credits are allowed. Give full 
credit (1) for such answers as: 
(a) ‘“Couldn’t swing cane with hands in pockets.” 
“Can’t have hands in pockets and swing cane unless he 
had cane on his arm.” 
(b) ‘If he was dead, taking him to the hospital wouldn’t 
do any good.” “Tf he’s killed he can’t get well.” 
(c) ‘Trying to make you think he had an extra brother.” 
“Couldn’t be a brother to himself.” ‘‘Only had two.” 
(d) “Tf they can’t read the first sentence, they can’t 
read about the blacksmith.” ‘‘Who was there to tell him 
to inquire at the blacksmith shop? The post couldn’t tell 
him.” ‘If you couldn’t read, how could you read at all?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  48 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
(e) “If they left the last one off, the one next to the last 
would be in as much danger.”’ ‘‘There would always be a 
last car.” 
Test 18. Construction of Sentences.—For this test the 
three groups of words presented in figure 23 or made of the 
black gummed letters which we have suggested (see p. 16). 
The examiner should say to the subject, “You see 
these words, read them to me please.’ And having assured 
himself that the subject recognizes the words, he should 
continue, “‘ Now please arrange them so that they make sense. 
Make one good sentence out of them, using every word that 
you read, but no other words.” 
The subject should be allowed only three minutes for 
actual work on this test. The sentences are to be spoken, 
not written. 
Scoring.—Give full credit for any English sentence 
containing all the given words and no other words. No 
half credits are allowed. Give full credit (2) for such 
answers as: 
(a) “I asked the teacher to correct my paper.” ‘T 
asked my teacher to correct the paper.’ ‘‘The teacher I 
asked to correct my paper.” 
(b) ‘‘A master defends his good dog bravely.” ‘A 
good dog defends his master bravely.’ 
(c) ‘‘We started for the park at an early hour.” ‘We 
started early for an hour at the park.” ‘We started for 
the park at an hour early.” ‘We started early at an hour 
for the park.” 
Test 19. Definition of Abstract Terms—The three 
abstract terms used are (a) charity, (6) obedience, and (c) 
justice. 
The examiner should say simply “What does charity 
mean?” and after recording the response, “What does 
obedience mean?” and so on. 
Scoring.—No half credits are given. The definition of 
charity should express two ideas, that of unfortunates, and 
of kindness shown to them. If the subject replies ‘‘love” 
ask him “what sort of love?” or ‘‘to whom is the love
-P-A-G-E-57
DIRECTIONS FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 49 
shown?” If for obedience, the subject says ‘‘to obey”’ 
ask him what obey means. The definition of justice 
should express the idea of persons treated according to 
their merits, of fairness, or of protection accorded to people 
and their interests. If the subject replies ‘justice of the 
peace” or names an individual, he should be told that that 
is not the kind of justice meant and should be given 
another trial. 
(a) Give full credit (2) for answers such as: ‘‘Take pity 
on people that ain’t got no homes.” ‘‘Anybody is poor 
and ain’t got no home, the charity helps them along.” 
“To give to the needy.” ‘‘When you look out for a poor 
person.” ‘‘Love for the poor.” ‘Society to take little 
wanderers and put them in homes.” No credit: ‘‘Give 
anything away that you have.’ ‘‘People have kind of 
society and help.” ‘To do anything for anybody for 
nothing.” ‘‘Love toward your neighbor.” ‘‘ Helping.” 
“Kindness.” 
(6) Full credit (2): ‘‘Mind the attendant, what they 
say.” ‘Tomind.” ‘Do what you are told.” 
(c) Full credit (2): ‘Do right by others.” ‘Treat 
everybody the same.” ‘‘To be fair and square with every- 
body.” ‘To give one person his rights.” ‘‘Not to let 
one do what you wouldn’t let another do.” No credit: 
“To do as you would be done by.” ‘‘Doing right.” ‘‘To 
do right.” ‘The law.” 
Remarks.—With very young children we often find in 
this test a confusion of the abstract with some similar 
concrete term such as ‘‘carriage’” (chariot?) with 
“charity;” ‘‘priest’”’ with “obedience;’’ and “‘digestion’”’ with 
“justice.” 
Test 20. Analogies.—The six analogies presented below 
are employed: 
(a) Oyster is to shell as banana is to—(skin or peel). 
(b) Arm is to elbow as leg is to—(knee). 
(c) Head is to hat as hand is to—(glove or mitten). 
(d) Truth is to falsehood as a straight line is to—(a 
crooked or a curved line). 
4 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  
50 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
(e) Known is to unknown as present is to—(future or 
absent). 
(f) Storm is to calm as war is to—(peace). 
The examiner should proceed as follows: ‘If I say ‘man 
is to boy as woman is to—,’ what should you say?” He 
should then pause for a second, and if the subject does not 
respond “‘girl” he should himself supply the word and 
continue “‘for girl has the same relation to woman as boy 
has to man.” He should then proceed to give two addi- 
tional examples, allowing the subject to supply the missing 
term in each case, or, if he cannot do so telling him what 
itis. The examples are: ‘‘Boat is to water as train is to— 
(track) ;” ‘Chew is to teeth as smell is to—(nose).’’? Hay- 
ing made such preparation for the actual test, the examiner 
should caution the subject, ‘‘Now, think well before you 
speak. Don’t hurry.” He should then present (a), record 
the result, and pass on to (b), and so on. 
The test will proceed more smoothly, if the examiner will 
emphasize the important words, as ‘‘Oyster is to shell as 
banana is to—.” It is particularly important not to accent 
the second “to.” In analogy (d) care should be taken to 
say “straight line” and not “‘straight line.” In the latter 
case many very young children who fail to comprehend the 
test at all, will answer ‘‘crooked” if the examiner says 
“straight” and then waits for a response. 8 
Scoring.—Credit of 1 point is allowed for the following 
replies: (a) “skin,” ‘‘peel,” ‘‘peeling;” (b) ‘‘knee;’’ (c) 
“glove,” ‘‘mitten;”’ (d) ‘crooked line,” ‘curved line,” 
“crooked,” ‘‘a curve;” (e) ‘future,’ ‘‘absent;” (f) “peace.” 
Remarks.—The most common error among young children 
is to take the final ‘‘to” as the beginning of an infinitive. 
Thus, we find many children giving ‘‘eat”’ as the completion 
of the first analogy.

  CHAPTER 3 
RESULTS OBTAINED WITH PRE-ADOLESCENT 
POINT SCALE 
NORMAL UNSELECTED SCHOOL CHILDREN 
In the original Point Scale investigation, examination 
was made of approximately 850 individuals whose mentality 
was at least sufficient for the adjustments demanded by 
their surroundings. 
Of these individuals, about 700 constituted the popula- 
tion of a city grammar school located in a medium to poor 
region and including grades from the kindergarten to the 
eighth. All pupils except those absent during the periods 
of examining were measured by the Point Scale; but from 
the records obtained several had to be excluded because of 
‘extreme language difficulty or incompleteness of record. 
The group from this school (hereafter designated as School 
B) finally selected for report includes 675 pupils. Of these 
379 are boys and 296 are girls. 
In a second city grammar school, which is located in a 
good neighborhood, the pupils of the kindergarten and 
first grade were examined. These numbered 60. But the 
extreme defectiveness and incompleteness of report in six 
cases force the exclusion of these individuals from the 
tables, and the group in this school (which we shall desig- 
nate hereafter as School A) is constituted by 54 pupils, of 
whom 26 are boys and 28 are girls. 
In addition to the above 729 children, 76 adults, ranging 
in age from 17 to 43 years and including 67 males and 9 
females, were examined. At alater date Yerkes and Wood! 
used in addition to these cases the records of 166 pupils in 
1 Yerkes, R. M. and Wood, L.: Methods of expressing results of measure- 
ments of intelligence: Coefficient of intelligence. Journ. of Educ. Psych., 
vol. 7, 1916, p. 593.

Iowa schools, and an 18 year old group in Cincinnati to 
correct the original norms. 
In Schools A and B no selection was exercised in connec- 
tion with the examining, but in the event that an examina- 
tion could not, for any reason, be given fairly, the record 
was rejected. Work in the schools was not, so far as we 
could discover, seriously influenced by the spread of 
information concerning the tests. In each school we com- 
menced with the kindergarten and worked up through the 
grades, assuming that the younger the pupils, the less they 
would be able to tell their playmates concerning the method 
of examining. From the third grade on we made it the 
rule to inquire, before beginning the examination, into 
the nature and extent of the individual’s knowledge of the 
scale. We were somewhat surprised to find that with very 
few exceptions the children had learned nothing of any 
consequence from their fellows, and in only a small number 
of cases was it necessary to exclude an examination or make 
allowance for undesirable information. Our experience 
indicates that in a large grammar school the children are 
unable to remember accurately and to describe to their 
companions the tests used in the Point Scale. Such 
information as they give is very general and usually mis- 
leading. We are, therefore, confident that our results 
have not been influenced to any considerable extent by the 
spread of information. 
The tests were given under extremely favorable condi- 
tions, in rooms which were quiet and comfortable, and the 
examinations were almost invariably free from the dis- 
turbing influence of a third person. We have every reason 
to suppose that apart from the possible slight variations 
due to different examiners our results are strictly compar- 
able, and the latter difficulty is not a serious one, since 
approximately four-fifths of the examinations were made 
by five experienced examiners! whose knowledge of the 
Point Scale was thorough-going and detailed, and who by 
1R. M. Yerkes, J. W. Bridges, K. F. Puffer, R. S. Hardwick, and L. D. 
Pedrick.

    RESULTS OBTAINED BY PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 53 
frequent consultation on points of method and of the values 
of results, tried to render their records both reliable and 
comparable. 
Further to increase the comparability of results, each 
record was examined by Dr. Yerkes and Dr. Bridges so 
that all doubtful cases could be discussed and passed 
upon- This procedure unquestionably eliminated many 
irregularities in the grading of certain of the tests.

The results for the group of 675 pupils in School B appear 
in table 1. They are classified according to both age and 
score. Hach individual is represented by his total score 
in the examination. A given age group includes all 
individuals from the middle of the year below to the middle

of the one above. Thus in the group of four-year-olds 
are included all children from three years seven months 
to four years six months. Consequently the extreme age 
limits in the table are three years seven months and fifteen 
years six months. 
If from the 675 pupils of School B, we exclude those born 
of foreign-speaking parents, we bce a distribution of total 
scores which is given in table 2 in percentages.

From this table it is evident that the scale is most accu- 
rate in the middle range. If we correlate the mental and 
chronological ages between chronological ages 6 and 12 
inclusive, we find by the method of rank differences, that 
r = 86. 
Some time after the original investigation was made, 
interest became aroused in the question of what scores on 
the separate tests could be expected for children of differ- 
ent mental ages. Foster and Taylor! worked over 316 
of the original records, using approximately, though 
not exactly, the same group given in the previous table. 
They discarded records on test 6, since the form of that 
test had been changed and from the original scores it was 
impossible to predict what score would have been attained 
on the revised tests. The average scores which they find

Records on subjects who were obviously feeble-minded or

Brown has explained the unusually large score obtained 
by his 8-year old children by saying that the majority of 
these cases fell in the six months above 8.0 and very few in 
the six months below. No explanation, however, is offered 
for the fact that the averages run consistently higher than 
the revised norms for the other ages inhis group. Perhaps 
the fact that there were none of the ‘‘very poor,” no 
obviously feeble-minded or “‘ very retarded”’ included means 
that his group was superior to that from which the ‘‘revised 
norms” of table 6 were obtained. 
For the psychological work in the United States army, a 
table of point scale norms was compiled to accord with 
the experience of a number of psychologists. These norms 
appear in table 7. They are recommended for use.

RESULTS OBTAINED BY PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 61 
Several attempts have been made to express the ‘‘amount 
of scatter” in examinations in numerical terms. Curtis! 
suggests a ‘‘variation total’ calculated from a table of 
expected scores which she presents. By using this method, 
normal children are found to vary less from the expected 
score for their mental age than other groups of subjects. 
Pressey? has used a somewhat different method for obtain- 
ing a table of expected scores and obtains slightly different 
results. One difficulty with both methods is that the 
higher the total score is, the less, roughly speaking, is the 
chance for variation. Probably some time we shall know 
what kind of failures are most significant and shall be able 
to weight them accordingly. Reference to this question 
of scatter and variability will be made again in the section 
on the examination of the insane. 
NORMAL SCHOOL CHILDREN FROM NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING 
HOMES 
In the original point scale examining one of the schools 
examined (School B) was located in a part of the city 
inhabited by foreign-born as well as by American-born 
individuals, and it was found that the two groups gave 
widely different results in the examination. The pupils 
were, therefore, divided into the children of English-speak- 
ing and those of non-English-speaking parents. The latter 
group includes 207 individuals. This classification was 
made irrespective of American or foreign birth, since in the 
English-speaking group were included many pupils born 
in Great Britain or her colonies, while in the non-English 
group, there appear many who were born in America in 
homes where other than English is spoken. Portuguese 
and Jewish children are the most numerous in the non- 
English group. The average scores attained by the 
English-speaking and non-English groups in School B 
together with the number of individuals in each language 
and age group appear in table 8. A given age group

It is not astonishing that the language difficulty should 
manifest itself in these averages, but it is somewhat surpris- 
ing that the difference in the norms for the English-speaking 
and the non-English-speaking children should be so slight 
as 1 and 2 points, respectively, at the ages of 5 and 6. It 
is obvious that the differences at the extremes of our series, 
the fourth and fifteenth years, are unreliable because of 
the small number of individuals in the groups. In general, 
it appears that the non-English children fall short by 5 to 
10 per cent. of the scores attained by their English-speaking 
companions. It is obviously unfair, then, to judge indi- 
viduals from these two groups by the same standard, and 
in calculating the mental age of a child from a non-English 
speaking home, table 8 above should be usedfand, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  RESULTS OBTAINED BY PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 63 
mental age recorded as obtained from ‘non-English 
norms.” 
SUBNORMAL AND DELINQUENT CHILDREN 
Since the publication of the first results with the Point 
Scale, most investigators naturally have been interested 
less in the accumulation of additional data on normal 
children than in the determination of the mental level of 
certain groups of children, particularly those suspected of 
mental inferiority. The result is that we have at hand a 
greater mass of results for subnormal, feeble-minded, and 
delinquent children than for unselected normal children. 
It is impossible here to cite these studies in detail, but we 
shall note the main results of a few investigations. 
Dr. Bird T. Baldwin has been kind enough to supply us 
with data on 500 retarded Pennsylvania school children. 
The pupils in this group were selected by the teachers 
either as children suspected of feeble-mindedness or known 
to be seriously retarded. In some instances the teacher’s 
judgment. of feeble-mindedness. was a mistake. The 
children are mostly from the lower level of the working 
class. We have here, then, a group near enough the 
normal to be in the public schools and yet sufficiently 
subnormal to attract the attention of their teachers. 
Table 9 summarizes Dr. Baldwin’s results for this group. 
The mental ages were calculated on the basis of table 8, p. 
64 of the first edition of this book, substituting 76 for the 
13-year score and 85 for the 15-year score. For the 
extremely high and extremely low mental ages there are so 
few cases that no conclusions can be drawn, but for ages 
7 to 15 we have a distribution which enables us to say 
whether or not any slightly subnormal child varies greatly 
from what we would expect. When we compare this 
table with that of expected scores for normal children 
given by Curtis,! we find comparatively little difference in 
the distribution of scores for the two groups, and what 
difference there is might easily be explained by the fact

66 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
that Curtis’ table is arranged by chronological, while 
Baldwin’s is arranged by mental age. A much greater 
difference between the data for mental and for chronological 
ages would, of course, be found in two groups whose mental 
ability was still more different. 
In a like manner Dr. Baldwin has found the distribution 
of scores on the separate tests obtained by 400 delinquent 
white boys and an equal number of delinquent white girls. 
We thought that since most investigators agree that 
certain tests are easier and certain ones are harder for 
feeble-minded children than they are for normal children 
of the same mental age, we might find that the sub- 
normals and the delinquents formed intermediate steps 
between the normals and the feeble-minded in this respect. 
We therefore combined Dr. Baldwin’s 800 delinquent 
records with the records on 372 delinquent girls supplied 
us by Dr. John E. Anderson and compared the average 
scores attained on the various tests by the same mental 
ages in the two groups. We found that, in general, the 
subnormal group was superior in tests 10 (simple definitions), 
12 (copying square and diamond), and 16 (drawing designs 
from memory), while the delinquent group was superior in 
17 (absurdities), 18 (dissected sentences), 19 (abstract 
definitions), and 20 (analogies). This is a comparison, 
however, of groups that differ not merely in amount of 
intelligence, or even in that plus traits leading to delin- 
quency, but also in chronological age. We shall find later 
that the ability to pass certain of the tests of the Point 
Scale varies greatly with chronological age, and the list 
of tests which we find as easy or hard for the delinquents 
as compared with the subnormal group is really a mixture 
of those tests which are easy or hard for the feeble-minded 
and those tests which are easy or hard for older subjects. 
This same difficulty is without a doubt a great factor in 
the discrepancies which are found between statements of 
1 That we were not confusing the issue by combining groups of different 
grades may be shown by the fact that the average mental age of Dr. Bald- 
win’s group is 11.8 while that of Dr. Anderson’s group is 11.9.  
-P-A-G-E-75
RESULTS OBTAINED BY PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 67 
different investigators as to the tests which are easy and 
hard for the feeble-minded. Perhaps if we could limit the 
groups of feeble-minded used in the different studies to 
those of the same chronological ages, we might get always 
the same list of ‘‘easy and hard tests.” 
The feeble-minded give, of course, lower mental ages 
than the normals or than the groups of subnormals and 
delinquents which we have cited. One investigation 
which included all the ‘‘ high-grade” children at the Massa- 
chusetts School for the Feeble-minded at Waverley,' found 
the average mental age (calculated by the norms used by 
Baldwin above) of this high-grade group to be 9.95. The 
average mental age for the entire school would, of course, 
be a great deal lower. For this group, the tests which 
proved to be unusually easy were 7 (interpretation of 
pictures), 12 (copying square and diamond), and 15.- 
(comprehension of questions), while those which were 
unusually difficult were 9 (comparison of objects), 13 
(free association), and 14 (three words in one sentence). 
THE INSANE 
The Point Scale is particularly well adapted for use in 
cases where the question of abnormality is important, that 
is, where we are interested not so much in the quantitative 
results, score or mental age, but in the qualitative results 
as well, that is, in what particular kinds of tests are passed 
or failed in attaining the total score and with what degree 
of satisfactoriness. 
Curtis? has compared the scores in the different tests for 
various psychoses with the scores expected from normal 
children of the same mental age. Her table showing 
the distribution of these differences on the different tests 
(‘variation total”) is here reproduced in condensed form 
as table 10. The group called ‘‘not psychotic” includes 
subjects who had been sent to the Psychopathic Hospital 
on the suspicion that they might be psychotic, but in

whom the psychiatrists could find no mental disease. 
From the group labelled ‘‘all psychoses” have been 
excluded all cases of psychopathic personality, manic- 
depressive insanity, hysteria, and psychoneurosis because 
these cases are in general so near the normal in intelligence.

“The alcoholic psychoses give by far the highest variation 
total. This high value is probably not a symptom of 
alcoholic psychosis itself, but rather of advancement of 
'P, 20. 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  RESULTS OBTAINED BY PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 69 
deterioration or depth of psychosis. Many persons, doubt- 
less, would expect the dementia praecox patients-to show 
greater variability than the alcoholics, and in the majority 
of hospitals for the insane this would probably be true, but 
in the Psychopathic Hospital in Boston we have rather a 
selected group . . . The (dementia praecox) group find 
their way into institutions comparatively early in life. 
They show hallucinations and delusions, etc., before they 
have deteriorated markedly and so, by the time they are 
greatly deteriorated they are already in a state asylum 
and not likely to enter a ‘‘clearing house” like the Psycho- 
pathic. Our dementia praecox cases, then, will be little 
deteriorated and, unless decidedly schizophrenic, will 
not show large variations. The cases of alcoholic psy- 
choses, on the contrary, do not come into the hospital until 
they are older and until their psychosis has begun to 
interfere definitely with their work. Besides the initial 
selection there is a further selection in the cases which are 
referred for psychological examination. The great majority 
of patients under age 25 are sent for this examination. 
This includes a great many cases of beginning dementia 
praecox, and practically none of beginning alcoholic 
psychosis. Of the more advanced cases, the alcoholics 
are more accessible and so if the problem is one of degree 
of deterioration, a deteriorated alcoholic will, in general, 
co-operate better than a deteriorated dementia praecox. 
This means that more deteriorated alcoholics will be 
referred to the psychological department and that of those 
referred we shall be ableto use the records of a greater 
per cent. of alcoholics than of dementia praecox. The 
above discussion may be interpreted to mean that we may 
expect larger variations from cases of psychosis of long 
standing . . . On the whole the outstanding feature of 
our table is that normals and ‘not psychotic’ subjects give 
smaller ‘variation totals’ than do the feeble-minded, and 
that the feeble-minded give smaller ‘variation totals’ 
than do the deteriorated or the markedly psychotic 
patients.”
-P-A-G-E-78
  70 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
We find, then, that there are decided differences between 
the examinations given by psychotics and by normals of 
the same mental age. It is to be regretted that at the 
time the above data were collected, chronological age was 
not taken into account. It seems certain, in the light of 
later researches, that many of the ‘‘ variation totals” would 
be altered if the chronological age as well as the mental 
were kept constant for the groups. 
Not only is the general variability from the expected 
score (or the ‘“‘amount of scatter’’) important, but the 
performance on some of the individual tests is of the greatest 
significance. Foster! has worked over considerable data 
on the scores obtained on tests of memory by various 
groups. There are three memory tests in the Pre-adoles- 
cent Point Scale, memory span for digits, memory for 
sentences, and memory for designs. Of these, test 6 (repe- 
tition of sentences) is poorly arranged for discrimina- 
tion between subjects, since very few fail in the first two 
sentences, and very few pass the last one, so that the ques- 
tion narrows down to whether some can or can not give the 
third (next to the longest) sentence. The scores for this 
third sentence show no regularity. 
In investigating the relationship of memory span for 
digits to diagnosis, it was found that “with all patients, 
whatever the diagnosis, memory span increases with 
advancing mental age; but the increase is so slight after 
mental age 10 we can show it only by keeping a decimal 
place. In general, we may say not only for all mental 
ages over 10 we may expect a memory span of six or seven 
digits, but also that one of only five digits is not unusual. 
When the cases with different diagnoses are grouped by 
chronological ages, again we find no significant differences. 
For example, for the four decades, from ten to forty-nine, 
our ‘not insane’ cases give averages of 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, and 6.3 
while dementia praecox patients give 5.3, 6.0, 5.3 and 5.7. 
Similarly patients suffering from other diseases show no 
regular change in the memory span with advancing chrono- 
1 Journ. of Applied Psych., 1920, 4, 142-154.
-P-A-G-E-79
  RESULTS OBTAINED BY PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE v1 
logical age. That the diagnosis itself has little or no rela- 
tion to the memory span may be seen from the fact that 
if we use only those cases where the mental age is 11.5 or 
over, so that we surely get no influence of mental age, we 
find the average number of digits to be: subjects suffering 
from dementia praecox, 5.8; from alcoholic psychoses, 5.9; 
from unclassified paranoid condition, 5.9; from manic- 
depressive psychoses, 6.1; those ‘not insane,’ 6.5; and the

From tables 12 and 13 ‘‘it appears that the insane are 
well below normal children, ‘not insane’ and feeble-minded 
of the same mental ages, but that scores tend to increase 
with advancing mental age. When we group our cases by 
chronological ages we find, on the contrary, that the 
average score tends to drop off with advancing age, at least 
after age 40 
“From the two tables just given we see that although 
cases with all diagnoses show increase in score on memory 
drawings with increase in mental age, and decrease in 
score with increase in chronological age after age twenty or 
thirty, there are, nevertheless, decided differences from 
diagnosis to diagnosis as to the exact age at which the 
change begins or is most marked. When we come to the 
question of the disease itself, it is therefore necessary to 
1 Journ. of Applied Psych., 1920, 4, p. 144.
-P-A-G-E-81
  
RESULTS OBTAINED BY PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 73 
reduce as far as possible the influence of mental and chrono- 
logical age. In order to do this, we have discarded those 
cases with mental ages below 11.5. This means that we 
have also eliminated practically all cases with chronological 
ages of 50 or more, for none of our older patients received 
high scores on the Point Scale. With such limitations we 
find the average scores on the test to be: cases diagnosed 
as ‘not insane,’ 2.9; normal children, 2.7; cases diagnosed as 
feeble-minded, 2.7; as dementia praecox, 2.1; as manic- 
depressive, 1.5; as acute alcoholic psychoses, 1.5; as dete- 
riorating alcoholic psychoses, 1.4; as syphilitic, psychoses 
1.2; as unclassified paranoid condition, .8; and of those 
diagnosed as arterio-sclerotic psychoses and senile demen- 
tia, there were too few cases. If further restriction is 
made by discarding all cases with chronological ages of 
over 30 we get the same order of diagnoses for the first 
six groups. The other groups drop out. The mean varia- 
tions for these averages are all about .9. 
“Tn the score for the drawings from memory, therefore, 
we find, a point at which the psychological examiner should 
be on the lookout for inconsistencies. Realizing that a 
high score is to be expected from young persons and from 
persons with a high mental age, the examiner should note 
any case where low chronological age and high mental 
age are combined with poor performance in the memory 
drawings. 
“Not only is the score on the memory drawings impor- 
tant, but the shape and size of the drawing itself may be 
indicative of mental disease. A drawing which receives 
no credit may be as significant as the one which adds to 
the total score. If we take the drawings which were not 
given any credit, we may arrange them in the following 
groups . . . those giving the general idea . . . those 
giving sketchy drawings (including also those who made 
no attempt, and those who omitted lines), and those giving 
elaborated drawings (including also those whose drawings 
showed no resemblance to the original). Our data give no 
evidence that mental age and chronological age have any
-P-A-G-E-82
  74 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
influence upon the type of memory drawing. The cases 
with the different diagnoses, however, give rather typical 
results. When we consider only those cases with mental 
ages of 11.5 or more (so that any influence of chronological 
age is even more certainly eliminated) we find those 
inclined to elaborate or fabricate in the drawings to be 
those suffering from syphilitic psychoses (43 per cent. ela- 
borated vs. 0 per cent. who give scanty drawings); from 
dementia praecox (24 per cent. elaborated vs. 12 per cent. 
scanty); and from unclassified paranoid condition (40 
per cent. vs. 30 per cent.). On the other hand, those tending 
to give scanty or sketchy drawings are: those suffering 
from deteriorating alcoholic psychoses (33 per cent. scanty 
vs. 0 per cent. elaborated); and the feeble-minded (19 per 
cent. scanty vs. 5 percent.elaborated). The cases diagnosed 
as “‘not insane”’ give less than 10 per cent. in either scanty 
or elaborated drawings.’ (Illustrations of such drawings 
are given at the end of this book in figure 22 taken from 
the article here quoted.) Figure 22 (a) ‘“‘shows a sketchy 
drawing of the ‘box’ made by a case of senile dementia, 
chronological age 75, mental age 7.5. Figure (b) shows a 
slightly elaborated drawing of the first figure made by a 
case of dementia praecox, chronological age 22, mental age 
11.2. Figure (c) shows practically no resemblance to the 
original ‘box’ which the patient, a case of general paresis, 
chronological age 50, mental age 8.9, was attempting to 
reproduce. The other figures in the plate are reproductions 
of the second memory drawing. Figure (d) was made by 
a case of manic-depressive insanity, chronological age 30, 
mental age 18.0 and belongs, of course, to the ‘scanty’ type. 
Figures (e) and (f) are examples of elaboration and were 
given by a case of dementia praecox, chronological age 
18, mental age 13.5 and by a case of general paresis, chrono- 
logical age 30, mental age 11.6. Figure (g) shows an 
entirely fanciful reproduction by a case of general paresis, 
chronological age 41, mental age 8.9. 
“Our main conclusions considering all computation of 
results on both drawings, individually and together, cases
-P-A-G-E-83
RESULTS OBTAINED BY PRE-ADOLESCENT SCALE 75 
with mental ages of 11.5 or over, and all mental ages 
together, types of drawings as originally separated, and as 
grouped together, are these: Patients suffering from syphili- 
tic psychoses, dementia praecox, and unclassified paranoid 
condition tend to elaborate the original drawing, or to make 
some fanciful combination of lines having little or no relation 
to the original. Cases of arterio-sclerotic psychoses and 
senile dementia are apt to fail to attempt the drawings at 
all. Cases of manic-depressive insanity, arterio-sclerotic 
psychoses and senile dementia are apt to omit lines. The 
feeble-minded omit lines more often than they add them. 
“The size of the drawing from memory is probably also 
of significance. Patients are not instructed to reproduce 
the drawings in any special size, though the size is roughly 
limited by the dimensions of the record sheet (10.5 in. by 
7.5 in.). If a patient asks ‘Shall I make it just the same 
size as the one I saw?’ he is told ‘Why, yes. Just about. 
You need not be too fussy.’ Very few patients ask. We 
shall confine ourselves to the discussion of the first drawing, 
since it is much the easier to measure, and we have observed 
that increase or decrease in the one drawing tends to carry 
over to another. The height of the original drawing is 4.4 
em. Our records give no evidence that mental and chrono- 
logical age have any influence on the size of the drawings 
from memory. The average heights of the drawings given 
by patients are: those diagnosed as ‘not insane,’ the feeble- 
minded, and those suffering from deteriorating alcoholic 
psychoses, each 3.8; those suffering from manic-depressive 
insanity, 4.1; from acute alcoholic psychoses, and from 
senile dementia, each 4.2; from arterio-sclerotic psychoses, 
and from unclassified paranoid condition, each 4.3; from 
dementia praecox, 4.4; and from syphilitic psychoses, 5.3. 
(The mean variations of all these averages are about 1.0.) 
Similarly, if we consider the percentage of cases’ giving 
extremely large or extremely small drawings, we find that 
the cases of syphilitic psychoses, of unclassified paranoid 
condition, and of dementia praecox tend to exaggerate 
the size; while the feeble-minded and the cases of manic-  
-P-A-G-E-84
  76 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
depressive and alcoholic psychoses tend to diminish the 
size. These groups are the same that we found in the 
discussion of the ‘types’ of the drawings. Thus, roughly 
speaking, paucity of detail and relative smallness of size 
are found in one group of diagnoses, elaboration of detail 
and largeness of size in another group. 
“We may summarize our discussion of the drawings 
from memory as follows: The psychologist should note: 
(1) a low score on the drawings from memory combined 
with a comparatively low chronological age and a high 
mental age; (2) elaborated or fanciful drawings; and (3) 
very large drawings.” 
Such work as this done on test 16 should be carried on for 
other types of test. We might, for example, expect that 
the manic-depressive-manic patients would give many 
words in three minutes, while the depressed patients would 
give few. 
THE INFLUENCE OF CHRONOLOGICAL AGE 
It has long been realized that elderly persons are less 
acute than adolescents and in general less adaptable to 
novel situations. Foster and Taylor! used the Point 
Scale to investigate the differences between psychotic and 
normal cases over fifty years of age, and incidentally to 
compare, as well as their data permitted, normal young 
persons with normal older persons. They conclude that 
the older psychotic persons do show a lower intelligence 
rating than their normalcontemporaries. Sincethe psycho- 
tic persons studied also have, if anything, a higher social 
rating, we must conclude that this greater deterioration is 
due to the progress of mental disease. If we consider the 
different mental diseases separately and compare the 
results for each with the average attainments of normal 
older persons, we find that dementia praecox, senile 
dementia, and arterio-sclerotic persons differ most from 
normal persons of their age, while manic-depressive and 
unclassified paranoid cases differ least.

From this table it appears that in general the total score 
falls off with advancing chronological age. The small 
number of cases in the highest age-group make the average 
scores unreliable. When we consider the age-groups 
50-59, 60-69, and 70-79 we find that not only does the 
total score fall off, but that there is a well defined tendency 
for the score in each test to fall off. This tendency is 
particularly marked in tests 16 (drawings from memory), 
18 (dissected sentences), 14 (three words in one sentence), 
and 13 (words in three minutes). It is least marked, on 
the other hand, in the very easy tests 1, 2, 3, and 5 (aesthe-

tic comparison, missing parts, comparison of lines and 
weights, and counting backwards), and in test 17 
(absurdities). 
Table 15 summarizes the results for three groups of 
normal subjects. The youngest of these is a group of 
Cambridge public school children between the ages of 10 
and 19 who were tested in obtaining the original norms 
for the Point Scale. The next group consists of 482? 
young men betweén the ages 20 and 30. This group is 
distinctly inferior in social status and education. Approxi- 
mately 80 per cent. are manual laborers, between 60 and 70 
per cent. of them left school before reaching the 5th grade 
and over 90 per cent. left before reaching the 9th. The 
oldest of these groups consists of 106 patients 50 or more 
years of age in a large general hospital in Boston. Of this 
group 76 per cent. are men; 59 per cent. are manual laborers; 
32 per cent. left school before the 5th grade, and 85 per cent. 
left before the 9th. The average social status of this 
group is, therefore, relatively low, although certainly 
higher than that of the group of young men. : 
No grade.could be given to the school children in test 6 
because the form of this test has been changed since they 
took the examination. Neither could any grade be given 
the young men in the Foster-Taylor group in tests 14 and 
18 since so many of them were illiterate that these tests 
were omitted. Allowance for these omissions has been 
made in the calculation of total scores given in the column 
at the left. The averages for the young men in tests 14 
and 18 are based upon Anderson’s figures alone. In the 
last section of the table we follow Foster and Taylor in 
giving the averages of the eight total-score groups. ‘This 
is, to be sure, an ‘average of averages.’ Even so, it is more 
significant than would be an average of the original scores. 
In the first place, we could not use the simple average of 
scores obtained on each test by each of our age-groups 
1 To the records of the 315 young men which Foster and Taylor published 
we have added records of 167 others of approximately the same age and social 
status, furnished us by Dr. John E. Anderson.

  THE INFLUENCE OF CHRONOLOGICAL AGE 79 
because there were so many more high scores among the 
younger that they would have appeared to too great an 
advantage. We, therefore, divided our cases in groups 
by total score attained. The averages for these groups 
may then be treated as if they had been ‘corrected’ and as 
if there were an equal number in each total score group, and 
our ‘average of averages’ is, then, the average score attained 
on each test by each age group, supposing the distribution 
of total scores for the age-groups to be the same.! 
From table 15 it appears that tests 13 (words in three 
minutes), 14 (three words in one sentence), 16 (drawings 
from memory), and 18 (dissected sentences) all show a 
marked falling off in score as the chronological age increases. 
This is most marked in test 16 (drawings from memory). 
On the other hand, tests 15 (comprehension of questions), 
17 (absurdities), and 19 (definition of abstract terms) 
show an increase in score with increased age. ‘‘From the 
results we may conclude that the improvement in ability 
to comprehend questions comes fairly early, since our young 
men are so far superior to the school children and are practi- 
cally the same as the older persons. The improvement in 
. definitions of abstract terms, on the other hand, 
seems fairly regular. The falling-off in giving words in 
three minutes seems regular, but in drawings from memory, 
the score does not show any decided decrease until late, 
that is, the young men differ but little from the school 
children, while the older persons are decidedly inferior to 
the young men.? 
“The above data show with reasonable certainty that 
there are decided changes in the distribution of abilities 
(as shown by the Point Scale) as persons get older. These 
changes appear whether we compare the insane or the 
normal, whether we lump all our cases together or fraction- 
ate them by particular disease, whether we compare the 
very old with the very young, or whether we compare the 
middle-aged with young adults. The only condition that 
must be observed is this one: that only those whose total

score, or general level of intelligence, is approximately the 
same may be reliably compared. If we do not make this 
restriction, the young will be found to excel in each test as 
well as in total score.”! 
The differences between the results given by old and by 
young normal persons are so striking that we must conclude 
that it is unfair to try to determine an elderly person’s 
mental rating by examining him with questions designed 
for adolescents. In the absence of an_ intelligence 
examination constructed for and standardized upon persons 
over fifty years of age, our only just procedure is to drop 
from the adolescent scale those tests which prove unsuitable 
for use with the older subjects, and make some adjustment 
in the total score of this abbreviated scale so that a mental 
age of 10 when applied to an old person places him in the 
same group as far as intelligence goes, with a young person 
of mental age 10. That is, it is important to know two 
things in regard to older persons: first, how they compare 
with their own previous record (this can be determined 
from using the usual Pre-adolescent Point Scale): and 
second, how they compare with their normal contemporaries 
(this can be determined by omitting certain point scale 
tests and then “‘correcting”’ the total score). 
The method of “correcting” total scores is perhaps most 
easily understood from the discussion given by Foster and 
Taylor? which we quote here in full. 
“Already at this (the Boston Psychopathic) hospital we 
had been in the habit of making allowance for the omission 
of certain tests and we now applied the same method toa 
scheme for discounting the effect of advancing years. Per- 
haps it will be as well to give the history of the previous 
work, so that the present calculations will not seem too 
fanciful. To be sure, the plan we are about to present 
has obvious faults and we can claim for it no more than 
fairly satisfactory results. We give it here in the hope that 
the idea will lead some others to similar work and will in 
the end result in an accurate and theoretically correct table.

  82 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
“The first problem of the kind which arose was the 
question of how to grade patients who were totally deaf 
and who, therefore, could not be given tests 4 and 6 (audi- 
tory memory span for digits and sentences). Our proce- 
dure at first was to add’ the scores with these tests omitted, 
call that the minimum mental age, then add to that the 
highest score obtainable on the two omitted tests, call that 
the maximum mental age, and then say that the true mental 
age lay somewhere between those two limits. This was 
fairly satisfactory, but we thought it possible to get a more 
accurate statement. This we computed from our table of 
scores for each test which were to be expected for different 
ranges of total score. From the table! we calculated the 
amount of credit to be expected on tests 4 and 6 for each 
of the ranges of total score. We then constructed a table 
giving the amount that should be added for each total score 
obtained when the two tests were omitted. We later made 
similar tables of corrections for omission of tests 14 and 18 
(lack of education) and for tests 1, 2, 3, (a), 7, 11, 12, 16, and 
18 (total blindness). The corrections for lack of education 
were adopted by the Division of Psychology in the Surgeon 
General’s Office for use in the examination of illiterates. 
The corrections are given in table 16. 
“With these tables as models, we proceeded to make a 
similar table to correct for advanced chronological age. 
We have found throughout, as we have said, that the 
older subjects are almost without exception poorer in 
tests 13, 14, 16, and 18 than younger persons attaining the 
same total score. We have therefore supposed that these 
tests should be omitted in giving the examination to old 
people and have calculated the corrections for such omis- 
sion. We do not mean that the tests should actually be 
omitted. On the contrary, if a person of over 50 years 
obtains a high score on the four tests, it is evident that he 
has not begun to lose certain abilities which many of his 
contemporaries have lost. In other words, in our opinion

failure on tests 13, 14, 16 and 18 on the Point Scale means

success on those tests may be very significant.

  84 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
“At first thought it may appear that if we correct for 
failures which seem to be due to advanced age alone, we 
should also correct for successes which are apparently due 
to the same cause. Perhaps we should. If the idea were 
carried to its logical extreme we would be correcting for 
every test except 1 and 20, the only ones in which the 
average score for young and old is identical. Such a 
procedure would, of course, be meaningless, and would 
amount to giving a mental age on the basis of two tests 
alone. Somewhere, then, we must draw the line between 
no correction and total correction. We considered at 
first correcting for those tests in which one age gave an 
average score which was 120 per cent. of the score obtained 
by the other age. This limit, however, would make us 
correct for 8 tests, in five of which the younger and in three 
of which the older were superior. Eight seemed such a 
large percentage of the total number of tests, 20, that we 
were afraid we were again basing mental age on too few 
tests. If the limit were raised to 200 per cent., we would 
be correcting for only three tests, 13, 14, and 16. Test 
18 which came next on the list with the younger excelling 
the older by 136 per cent. was later included because the 
test is one which many of the older subjects like, and which 
often they cannot see to read. The actual limit used was, 
therefore, 136 per cent.” 
THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL STATUS 
In the original point scale investigation, examinations 
were made in two very different schools; School A and 
School B. School A was located in a good neighborhood 
and. the sociological status of almost all the pupils was 
good to excellent. With few exceptions, these individuals 
were American-born as well as of English-speaking parent- 
age. School B, on the contrary, was located in a medium 
to poor region of the city, and the majority of its pupils 
lived in a medium to poor environment.
-P-A-G-E-93
THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL STATUS » 85 
Unfortunately it was possible to examine in School A 
only the pupils of the kindergarten and the first grade, and 
we have, therefore, for contrast with children of approxi- 
mately the same age in School B only 54 individuals. 
Since practically all the pupils of the favored group, as 
we may call that of School A, were born of English-speaking 
parents, it is obvious that they should be compared with 
the children of the English-speaking group of School B. 
Table 18 gives the average scores for pupils of different 
ages in the two groups. We have here omitted the data 
for age 4 on account of the very small number of cases.

The differences which appear in this table are extremely 
marked. The advantage is entirely with the favored group, 
and the average scores run from 10 to 30 per cent. higher 
than those for the unfavored group. 
In order to make a more exact comparison, we took 54 
individuals, 26 boys and 28 girls, of School A and then 
selected individuals of the same sex and of as nearly as 
possible the same age from School B. Care was taken, in 
this attempt to match an individual of School A with an 
individual of School B, to avoid language difficulty. 
Otherwise, there was no discrimination in the selection. 
Throughout the discussion we shall designate the pupils 
of School A as favored and those of School B as unfavored. 
Table 19 gives the data for the two groups by tests. 
The results for boys and for girls are not separated.

It will be seen that in every test except no. 6 the favored 
excel the unfavored on the average. In tests 3 (comparison 
of lines and weights), 9 (comparison of objects), 15 (com- 
prehension of questions), and 19 (definitions of abstract 
terms), the difference between the two averages is suffi- 
ciently larger than the mean variation of the difference to 
warrant the belief that we have here some tests in which the 
children from higher social strata excel. Whether this 
difference in total score shows that an inferior social status 
results in a lowered mentality, or whether it shows that a 
lower mentality results in an inferior social status, we can- 
not, of course, say. However, it is clear that we cannot 
expect the average child from poor home surroundings to 
grade as high as a child of the same chronological age from
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE INFLUENCE OF SEX - 87 
excellent home surroundings. If the unfavored child 
should grade above the average of the favored, it would 
mean that he had the mentality of the average favored 
child and that he also had the ability to overcome to some 
extent at least, unfortunate home conditions. To get a 
true picture of the mental ability of any child, it would be 
a great advantage if we could compare him first with the 
average child of his chronological age, and then with the 
average child of his chronological age and also of his 
sociological status. (See the suggestion for computing 
two mental ages for old people.) This idea if carried to its 
logical extreme would mean perhaps that the total point 
scale score for any individual child should be compared 
with the norm for his chronological age, with the norm for 
his chronological age and his sociological status, with thenorm 
for his chronological age, his sociological status, and his 
sex, with the norm for his chronological age, his sociological 
status, his sex, and his race, and so on ad infinitum. Any 
such degree of detail would, of course, be absurd, for we 
would soon get to a point where the scale was found much 
too coarse for any such series of distinctions. However, 
it is very important to remember that there are certain 
variables (particularly the degree of facility in the use of 
English) which have a marked influence on the total score 
and which should be allowed for somehow, perhaps by 
special norms, certainly by special norms in the non-English 
group. 
THE INFLUENCE OF SEX 
On the basis of total score for the entire scale, no signifi- 
cant sex differences can be made out from the original Point 
Scale results, but there seem to be sex differences in the 
ease with which certain of the individual tests are passed. 
Baldwin concludes from a study of the records of 400 
delinquent white boys and 400 delinquent white girls that 
“no sex differences are apparent in tests 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 
11, 12,18. Girls are markedly superior in 14 and 15, three
-P-A-G-E-96
88 ‘A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
words in one sentence, and comprehension of questions 
which depend upon imagination, command of language 
forms and judgment in imaginary situations. Boys are 
superior in 4, 8, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, which include memory 
span for digits, comparison of weights, definitions, free 
associations, drawing designs from memory, recognition of 
logical absurdity, definition of abstract words and analogy.”’! 
THE INFLUENCE OF RACE 
During the course of the examinations in School B in 
the original Point Scale examination, some of the examiners 
were impressed by certain apparently constant differences 
in the performances of the Irish and the Hebrews. The 
indication was that the Hebrews did markedly better in 
their examinations than did the Ivish. 
In order to measure the reliability of this suspicion, we 
have selected a group of 45 Irish pupils, both males and 
females, ranging in age from four years ten months to 
fifteen years and ten months, and a similar group of 45 
Hebrews, whose ages range from four years eleven months 
to sixteen years. 
The method by which these groups were chosen is as 
follows. Since the Irish pupils were most numerous, we 
selected, first, 45 Hebrews, and recorded the sex, age, 
number of points scored in each test and the total score. 
We then selected for each individual in the Hebrew group, 
an Irish pupil of the same sex and of, as nearly as possible, 
the same chronological age. In a few cases only, is the 
difference in age greater than one month, while the average 
age for each group is nine years and two months. The 
average scores by tests for the two groups are given in 
table 20. 
The differences in the average scores obtained by these 
two races are so very slight that they are insignificant.

In the psychological examining in the United States 
army, a large number of negroes were given the Point 
Scale examination. No comparison of negro and white 
intelligence as measured by the Point Scale can be made 
from these data, however, since individual examinations 
were given only to those who failed to pass ,a group 
examination and therefore any comparison is not between 
“average whites’ and ‘‘average negroes” but between 
“low grade whites” and ‘‘low grade negroes.’ There is, 
nevertheless, one army report! from which we can learn 
which tests were comparatively easy and which compara- 
tively difficult for the negro. 200 cases of negroes and 200 
cases of whites were selected: ‘‘(1) Distributed within the 
letter ratings in the same proportions as those ratings exist 
in the total negro draft, 7.e., so chosen as to have the same 
percentage of A’s, B’s, C’s, etc., as in the total negro draft 
of 1762 men; and (2) with each negro case paired off with 
a white making the same total score, 7.e., each negro score 
of 8, 20, 40, etc., paired off with a white total score of 8, 20, 
40, etc. Thus the material compares equal amounts of 
negro and white intelligence typical of the total amount of 
intelligence of the whole negro draft . . . The average

scores made by the 188 negroes on the separate tests. 
are compared with the average scores made by the cor- 
responding whites. The comparison is expressed in terms 
of the percentage of white score made by negroes.”’ These 
results are given in table 21 which ‘‘gives opposite the

by the negroes . . . Taking the results at their face 
value, the negroes excel the whitesin . . . the free associa-

INFLUENCE OF AMOUNT OF SCHOOL TRAINING 
In a later chapter (Ch. 6, p. 137) we suggest that in the 
very early years home training and school training are of 
such permanent importance that they must be considered
-P-A-G-E-99
  
INFLUENCE OF AMOUNT OF SCHOOL TRAINING 91 
in any attempt at measuring the mental age. That is not 
our present problem. Nor is the question of how many or 
what tests may be considered tests of school knowledge. 
The ideal of any mental examination is one which consists 
solely of tests of ability, not tests of taught information. 
Such an ideal is, of course, impossible of attainment. An 
extreme example is found in the tests which require the 
ability, to read. This ability depends, most of all, on 
whether the child has been taught to read, and thus an 
individual without schooling is at a decided disadvantage. 
Granting, then, that some slight school training is neces- 
sary for an average performance on the examination we are 
interested in the question of whether there is a definite 
relationship between the number of years spent in school 
and mental age, or between the marks obtained in school 
and mental age. 
Foster! reports the case of a 15 year old boy who had had 
practically no school training, although he had learned to 
read, who had had practically no contact with other 
children, and no home education save what he may have 
picked up from the reading of a few religious books, and 
perhaps a stray copy of a newspaper, and who still received 
a mental age of 16.0 on the Point Scale. 
Anderson? studied the relation between mental age and 
grade location in the institution school of 150 girl delin- 
quents. With his own results he combines those of vari- 
ous other investigators, and concludes that ‘‘There is 
apparently a close relationship between chronological age and 
mental age and between chronological age and school 
grade in normal children. But there is little relation 
between mental age and grade location. . . In institu- 
tions for delinquents a different situation holds . . . It 
appears that there is practically no relationship between 
chronological age and mental age, some relation between 
chronological age and school grade, and a close relationship 
between mental age and school grade.’ These results

-P-A-G-E-100
  92 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
would go to show that when the chronological age of the 
child is of little importance (as in the case of the delinquents) 
that the location in school grade is roughly determined by 
the mental age. The reason for the obscuring of the 
relationship in the case of the normal children may be 
explained partly by the fact that our school system gives 
little opportunity for the very superior child to skip through 
enough grades to bring him with his mental equals, and 
partly by the fact that progress in school necessarily 
depends more upon what the child does than upon what he 
can do, whereas the mental tests are intended to show what 
the child can do, not what he has done for any period. 
Such results as we have cited above, do not, of course, 
tell us how much school training helps a child in an intelli- 
gence examination. 
In chapter 5 we give some evidence upon the relationship 
between scholarship and intelligence among college students.

CHAPTER 4 
AN ABBREVIATED PRE-ADOLESCENT POINT SCALE 
In the psychological examinations in the army, it was 
found impossible to take time to give the entire Point 
Seale and therefore an abbreviated Point Scale was devised 
with a total possible credit of 50 points. The tests selected 
to form this short Point Scale were: 2 (missing parts), 
4 (memory span for digits), 9 (comparison of objects), 10 
(definition of concrete terms), 12 (copying square and 
diamond), 15 (comprehension of questions), 16 (drawing 
designs from memory), 17 (absurdities), and 20 (analogies). 
“These are not in all cases the tests having the highest 
diagnostic value, since it was necessary to consider time 
required to give a test, suitableness and illiterate subjects, 
and desirability of obtaining a short scale comparable in 
difficulty throughout its range with the entire scale.’’! 
“The data on the abbreviated point scale consisted of 
479 records. The average score for the entire scale. was 
53.3; for the abbreviated scale 26.6. 
“The total score on the abbreviated scale is 50 points. 
Records of 476 men were recorded on the abbreviated 
scale and the scores obtained multiplied by 2. The 
deviations of the short scale scores in points from the scores 
on the entire scale were then calculated. 
“The median deviation was found to be 3 points, and 
the mean deviation 4.14 points. Since the yearly incre- 
ments in points beginning with mental age 5 are 6, 7, 6, 9, 
8, 6, 6 and 4 up to mental age 18, it will be seen that the 
median deviation of 3 points corresponds to approximately 
a half year in mental age from 5 to 8, about a third of a

year from 8 to 10, a half year from 10 to 12, and three- 
quarters of a year at 13. . . The correlation of abbre- 
viated with complete Point Scale for the 475 subjects, 
ranging in mental age from 4 to 18 years, was 0.934 
(Pearson).”

examining in the United States Army,’ showing the

Several other short Point Scales were worked out at 
different camps in the army, but these show a lower 
correlation with the complete scale than does the 
abbreviated scale given above. 
In all such abbreviated scales, we find mean deviations 
from the entire scale of approximately half a year mental 
age. This deviation is, of course, large enough to neces- 
sitate caution in the use of any brief scale, if the results so 
obtained are to be compared with those from the entire scale.

CHAPTER 5 
A POINT SCALE FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF 
INTELLIGENCE IN ADOLESCENT AND ADULT 
INDIVIDUALS! 
The application of the original pre-adolescent point scale 
has proved that it yields most reliable measurements of 
intelligence from the ages of 6 or 7 to 12 or 13 years. The 
scale offers too few opportunities for credit to individuals 
under 7 years, and too few opportunities for failure to 
bright individuals above 13 years. It has, therefore, 
seemed to us desirable to develop two additional point 
scales to supplement the original scale: the one to be called 
an infant scale; the other, an adolescent scale. With the 
completion of these, we should have, for the measurement 
of intelligence, three scales of twenty tests each which may 
conveniently be designated as: (1) the infant scale, (2) the 
child scale, and (3) the adolescent scale. The latter should 
be understood as covering maturity as well as adolescence. 
Late in 1915 we assembled twenty tests as an adolescent 
point scale group, arranged them chiefly in accordance 
with convenience of presentation, weighted them in the 
light of our clinical experience, and proceeded to accumu- 
late data which should enable us thoroughly to criticize 
the proposed scale and profitably to revise or reconstruct it. 
It is the purpose of this report to describe the initial 
form of the adolescent point scale with the directions for its 
use, and to present certain general results from approxi- 
mately two hundred and fifty examinations. 
It should be stated with emphasis that the point scale 
herein described is merely a provisional group of tests

Commission on Mental Diseases, whole number 167 (1917.1).

which we have no thought of standardizing, but which we 
propose to revise thoroughly on the basis of the results 
obtained by various examiners before we enter upon the 
task of securing norms for the individual tests and for a 
revised form of the scale. 
The record blank which we have employed is reproduced 
below. It consists of four pages, the tests on which are 
so arranged that all of those involving writing or drawing 
by the subject appear on the last page. 
Most of the tests of the group are in principle old, 
although much new material has been introduced, and in a 
few instances the tests have been so modified as to be 
markedly different from their earlier forms. 
For Test 1 there are used, instead of the Binet pictures, 
three Perry pictures (Boston Edition, penny size): 
(a) Picture No. 893, entitled ‘“‘Saved.” 
(b) Picture No. 1076, entitled ‘‘The Music Lesson.” 
(c) Picture No. 2785, entitled “‘The Child Handel.” 
For Test 2 the same set of weighted cubes is employed 
as in the original point scale. The Healy butcher shop 
picture is used for test 4, in accordance with the directions 
given below. 
Test 12 is a new test based upon the Yerkes multiple 
choice method of measuring ideational efficiency.1 The 
five cards which are used as materials for this test appear 
in Fig. A (p. 101) reduced one-half. In our set of mate- 
rials, the standard card for this test measures 6 by 8 inches. 
Tests 18, 14, and 17 are taken directly from the Stanford 
Scale. 
The material for test 15 is presented on the record blank, 
on the fourth page of which appear seven capital letters, 
which are to be arranged in order of increasing total length 
of line. 
For the code learning test an explanatory drawing and 
letter code with the word nor written in symbols is first

and have already served their purpose as guides in a 
preliminary application of the scale by several experienced 
examiners. 
BRIEF PRELIMINARY DIRECTIONS FOR USING THE 
ADOLESCENT-ADULT POINT SCALE 
These directions will suffice for experienced examiners 
only. 
The scale is to be used only for individuals whose intel- 
lectual ability appears to be equal to or greater than that 
of the twelve-year-old child.
-P-A-G-E-111
SCALE FOR ADOLESCENT AND ADULT INDIVIDUALS 103 
The order of tests need not be followed strictly if good 
reasons for change appear. 
This scale has not yet been standardized and is subject 
to revision. Norms are to be established. 
It is desirable to keep very full records of responses, in 
order that the tests may be criticized, modified, and 
standardized. 
MATERIALS 
Stop-watch. 
Test 1. Three Perry pictures (‘‘Saved,” ‘‘The Music 
Lesson,’”’ and ‘‘The Child Handel”’). 
Test 2. Set of five weighted cubes, 3,°6, 9, 12, and 15 
grams. 
Test 4. Picture of butcher shop (Healy). 
Test 12. Five cards for relational test. 
Test 16. Two cards for code test. 
Test 18. Cards for geometrical test. _ 
Test 19. Card for reproduction of diamonds. 
Test 20. Card for memory for designs. 
DIRECTIONS 
Test 1. Response to pictures (maximum credit, 9 points). 
Three Perry pictures are to be used in this test: (a) 
“Saved;” (b) ‘‘The Music Lesson;” (c) ‘The Child 
Handel.” 
Picture (a) is placed before the subject, and the examiner 
says: ‘Please describe this picture for me as well’ as 
you can.’’ As soon as the subject has completed the 
description, if interpretation has not already been given, 
ask: ‘‘What does it mean?” 
Give credit as follows for each picture: For excellent 
description (at least eight features correct) give 2 points; 
same with correct interpretation, 3 points. For good 
description (four to seven features correct) give 1 point; 
same with correct interpretation, 2 points. For meager 
description (only two or three features correct), with 
correct interpretation, give 1 point. For simple enumera- 
tion, allow no credit.
-P-A-G-E-112
  104 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
Time for each picture, 2 minutes. 
Test 2. Comparison of weights (maximum credit, 3 
points). 
Have the five weights arranged in order, so that they 
can be presented quickly and without trial. Then present 
as part (a) of the test, the weights 6 and 9 grams, saying: 
“Tell me, please, which is the heavier of these two blocks.” 
Similarly, (6), present the 12- and 15-gram blocks. (c) 
Present the five weighted blocks, saying: ‘Please arrange 
these in order of increasing weight, the lightest at one end, 
the heaviest at the other.” 
To avoid the extreme risk of guesses, give two trials for 
parts (a) and (b). Give only one trial for part (c), but 
let the second trial for parts (a) and (6) follow part (c). 
It is especially important in this test that the examiner 
should not suggest the lifting of the weights or any other 
method of comparison. 
Give credit as follows: For (a) give 1 point if the weights 
are immediately compared by lifting and if correct judg- 
ments are given in both trials. Give no credit if a mistake 
is made in either trial. Likewise, for part (b) give 1 point 
credit for correct and immediate judgment on the basis of 
lifting, allowing no credit if a mistake is made in either 
trial. For (c), give 1 point credit if the weights are 
arranged in correct order. Allow no credit if a mistake 
is made. 
Time for (a) 30 seconds; (b) 30 seconds; (c) 1 minute. 
Test 3. Memory span for digits (maximum credit, 5 
points). 
Say to the subject: ‘‘Please listen carefully and as 
soon as I stop, repeat just what I have said.”

Present the digits orally at the rate of two per second, 
enunciating very clearly and distinctly. If the subject 
fails to reproduce a given group, present the group con- 
taining the same number of digits under Trial 2. If the 
subject fails in this trial, proceed no further with the test; 
but if, instead, success is attained, present in like manner 
the next larger group of digits under Trial 1, and continue 
according to the above directions until the subject has 
failed in both trials for a given group of digits. 
Give 1 point credit for the perfect reproduction, in either 
Trial 1 or Trial 2, of each of the five parts of the test. 
Time, 2 minutes. 
Test 4. Suggestibility (maximum credit 5 points). 
Present the picture of a butcher shop (Healy) to the 
subject, with the statement: “I am going to show youa 
picture for ten seconds. Please look at it carefully so that 
you can answer some questions I shall ask about it.” 
Allow the subject ten seconds for the examination of the 
picture, then remove it and ask as rapidly as possible the 
following twenty questions, recording the subject’s responses 
thus: Let + indicate correct statement or resistance; —, 
incorrect statement or acceptance of suggestion. The 
questions involving suggestion are indicated by S.

17. Did you see the ice box (refrigerator) behind the 
butcher? 
S. 18. Was the butcher’s hat black? 
19. Was the floor clean? 
S. 20. How many windows did you see? 
Give 5 points’ credit if all the suggestions are resisted 
either by correct statement or by the statement: ‘‘I don’t 
know.” Give 4 points if nine of the ten suggestions are 
resisted. Give 3 points if eight of the ten are resisted. 
Give 2 points if seven of the ten are resisted. Give 1 
point if six of the ten are resisted. 
Time, 15 seconds for each question. 
Test 5. Memory for unrelated sentences (maximum 
credit, 5 points). 
Say to the subject: ‘Now please listen very carefully, 
and after I stop, repeat just what I have said.’ Then 
present the following sentences in order, with almost no 
pause between thé two sentences of a given part. 
(a) The sea is very rough. Skill comes with patience. 
(b) There are many kinds of play and work. We should 
always be truthful. 
(c) No one can afford to be untrue to himself. It is time 
for us to return. 
(d) I saw a large, black object in the sky. If he had seen 
the happy, young face, his heart would have melted. 
(e) As we looked across the dusty, gray plain, our eyes 
ached. It is not possible to acquire too many good 
habits of mind. 
Give 1 point credit for precisely correct reproduction of 
each part. Give no credit if a single error is made, unless 
it is clearly a case of a misunderstood word. Allow only 
one trial. 
Time, 15 seconds for each part. 
Test 6. Comparison of terms (maximum credit, 6 points). 
Say to the subject: ‘I wish you would compare as well as 
you can, milk and water; that is, tell all the important
-P-A-G-E-115
  SCALE FOR ADOLESCENT AND ADULT INDIVIDUALS 107 
likenesses and differences you can think of.” Similarly, 
present as part (b) the terms paper and iron; as part (c), 
the terms idleness and laziness. 
Give 2 points credit for a comparison involving four or 
more correct and important elements in case of (a) or (6), 
and the essential differences in case of part (c). 
Give 1 point for two or three correct and important 
elements in case of (a) or (b) and the correct defining of 
either term in case of (c). 
Time, 2 minutes for each part. 
Test 7. Comprehension of questions (maximum credit, 
5 points). 
Say: “I shall now ask you some questions. Please 
answer them as satisfactorily as you can.” 
(a) Why is a train safer than a steamer or an aeroplane? 
(b) Why is it better to judge people by what they do rather 
than by what they say? 
(c) Why should we be more ready to forgive an unkind 
act done in anger than one done without anger? 
(d) Why should a man accused of a crime be considered 
innocent until he is proved guilty? 
(e) Why is honesty the best policy? 
Give one point credit for correct answers or such as in 
your judgment show fair insight, judgment, and reasoning 
ability. Disagreement with the answer suggested by the 
form of the question should receive credit if logically 
supported. Differences from the conventional type of 
answer may indicate superiority, and should, if reasonable, 
receive full credit. It is important to grade closely. 
Time, 2 minutes for each part. 
Test 8. Definitions (maximum credit, 8 points). 
Say to the subject: ‘‘I wish you to define, as accurately 
as you can, the following words.’ Or, if the subject is com- 
paratively illiterate, say: ‘‘I wish you to tell me what these 
words mean: (a) house; (b) door; (e) honesty; (d) conceit.” 
Give 2 points credit for an excellent form of definition 
containing the essential elements, whether or not conven- 
tional. Give 1 point credit for a definition which involves 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  108 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
enough correct elements for the certain identification of the 
concept. 
Time, 1 minute for each term. 
Test 9. Appreciation of absurdities (maximum credit, 5 
points). 
Say to the subject: ‘‘I am going to read some sentences 
to you and I wish you to tell me what you think of them.” 
The examiner must be especially careful not to suggest 
that the sentences are foolish or absurd. 
(a) It has been found that the last car of a train is damaged 
most in case of an accident. It, therefore, seems 
best to leave off the last car. 
(6) The commissioners have resolved to build a new jail 
from the materials of the old jail, but they are going 
to keep the prisoners in the old jail until the new one 
is finished. 
(c) A father wrote to his son: ‘‘I enclose ten dollars. If 
you do not receive this letter, please send mea 
telegram.” 
(d) A man wished to dig a pit in which to bury some 
rubbish. He could not decide what to do with the 
dirt from the pit. A friend suggested that he dig 
the pit large enough to hold the dirt, too. 
(e) A man claims that he has a telescope which is so 
powerful that when he looks at a church five miles 
away, it appears so near that he can hear the organ. 
Give 1 point credit for each detection and clear statement 
of an absurdity. Grade closely. 
Time, 1 minute for each part. 
Test 10. Analogies (maximum credit, 6 points). 
“Tf I should say, ‘Man is to boy as woman is to—’, how 
would you complete the sentence?” If the subject says, 
“girl,” proceed with the next example. If not, supply the 
missing word. ‘‘Boat is to water as train is to—.” Again 
give the subject an opportunity to complete the sentence, 
and if he is unable to do so, supply the missing word. 
Having made clear the nature of the text, proceed to 
present in order the following six analogies:
-P-A-G-E-117
  SCALE.FOR ADOLESCENT AND ADULT INDIVIDUALS 109 
(a) Pocket is to coat as closet is to —. 
(6) Sun is to day as moon is to —. 
(c) Arm is to elbow as leg is to —. 
(d) Known is to unknown as present is to —. 
(e) Whole is to part as six is to —. 
(f) Sunday is to Saturday as January is to —. 
Give 1 point credit for each correct response. Grade 
carefully and closely. Time for each part, 30 seconds. 
Test 11. Association of opposites (maximum credit, 4 
points). 
Say to the subject: ‘‘I am going to read off a list of words, 
and as I read them, I wish you would give me the opposite 
of each word, like this: high—low; large—small; hard— 
soft. Now we shall begin.” 
Wise Never Busy Generous Many 
Silent Joy Distant Horrid Rough 
Similar Prompt Lazy Rude Upper 
Cheap Vacant Easy Top After 
Give 4 points credit for correct response to each of the 
twenty words. Give 3 points credit if not more than three 
mistakes appear. Give 2 points credit if not more than 
six mistakes appear. Give 1 point credit if not more than 9 
mistakes appear. 
Time, 3 minutes. 
Test 12. Relational test (maximum credit, 8 points). 
Explain thus to the subject the nature of the test: ‘I 
am going to show you a card with four lines of squares and 
circles on it.’”’ Then show the explanation card with the 
circle in each case as the first symbol at the left and ask the 
subject, ‘‘What is the relation of the circle to the squares 
on this card?” If he does not perceive that it is always 
the first symbol at the left, explain this relation to him. 
Make perfectly sure that the idea of uniform relationship, 
that is, the same relationship for each of the four lines, is 
grasped. Having thus made plain the nature of the test, 
present in turn cards representing the four relations of 
symbols (Fig. A, p. 101). 
   
-P-A-G-E-118
  110 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
(a) Middle. 
(b) Second from left end. 
(c) Fourth from right end. 
(d) One place to the right of middle, or always two more 
squares on the left of the circle than on the right. 
Give 2 points credit for each part for which the relation 
is discovered and correctly -formulated. Give 1 point 
credit if the relation is so perceived that it can be repro- 
duced in new groups of symbols, but cannot be expressed in 
words. 
Time, 2 minutes for each part. 
Test 13. Box test (maximum credit, 4 points). 
“Please tell me how many boxes you would have if I 
gave you: (a) A large box with two smaller boxes inside of 
it, and inside of each of the smaller boxes, one still smaller. 
(b) A large box with two smaller boxes inside of it, and 
inside of each of the smaller boxes, two still smaller. (c) A 
large box with three smaller boxes inside of it, and inside 
of each of the smaller boxes, three still smaller. (d) A 
large box with four smaller boxes inside of it, and inside of 
each of the smaller boxes, four still smaller.” 
Give 1 point credit for correct response in case of each 
part. 
Time, 1 minute for each part. 
Test 14. Ingenuity (maximum credit, 7 points). : 
Say to the subject: “I am going to give you some | 
practical problems. If you wish to, you may use this 
pencil and paper in working them out.” Then present: 
(a) ‘If you were asked to get seven pints of water from a 
well and were given a three-pint vessel and a five-pint 
vessel, could you measure out exactly seven pints without 
guessing at the amount, if you began by filling the five- 
pint vessel first? You understand that you have no third 
vessel, but if you want to, you can throw out water.” 
If the subject fails to solve this problem in three minutes, 
explain it to him in the following way: ‘‘Fill the five-pint 
vessel. Then from it, fill thethree-pint vessel. Now, empty 
the three-pint vessel. Pour the two pints remaining in 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  SCALE FOR ADOLESCENT AND ADULT INDIVIDUALS 111 
the five-pint vessel into the three-pint vessel and refill the 
five-pint vessel. As a result, you will have precisely seven 
pints of water in the two vessels.” 
After the correct solution of (a), either by the subject or 
with the aid of the experimenter, present as (b): “‘If you 
were asked to get eight pints of water and were given a five- 
pint vessel and a seven-pint vessel, could you measure out 
exactly eight pints of water without guessing at the amount, 
if you began by filling the five-pint vessel first? (c) If 
you were asked to get seven pints of water and were given 
a four-pint vessel and a nine-pint vessel, could you measure 
out exactly seven pints without guessing at the amount, 
if you began by filling the four-pint vessei first?” 
Make sure that the problems are understood, so far as 
the subject is capable of understanding them. 
Give 8 points credit for correct and independent solution 
of problem (a). Give 2 points credit for correct solution of 
problem (0), either with or without explanation of problem 
(a). Give 2 points credit for problem (c), either with or 
without explanation of problem (a). 
Time, 3 minutes for part (a); 2 minutes for part (b); 2 
minutes for part (c). 
Test 15. Comparison of capital letters (maximum credit, 
2 points). 
Present to the subject on page 4 of the record sheet the 
capital letters L, H, N, |, Y, V, and M, saying: “Please 
look at these letters carefully and arrange them in order of 
the length of line which is needed to make them. You see 
if you straighten out the M, it would make a much longer 
line than the |.’ Make sure that the subject understands 
what is meant. Then give him a pencil and have him 
write the letters on the record sheet, in the space provided, 
in what he conceives to be the correct order. 
Give 2 points credit for the correct order—I, L, Y, V, H, 
N, M. Give 1 point if either of the pairs of letters L, Y, or 
H, N, is reserved. Give no credit if both pairs are reversed, 
and no credit for anything poorer. 
Time, 2 minutes.

Explain the purpose and meaning of the code test by 
drawing the following figure and indicating to the subject 
the symbols for the word “nor.” 
nh r 
Te o| eer 1 | q rl 
After you are sure that the subject understands the 
nature of the test, say: ‘‘I am now going to show you a 
figure in which different letters are used. I shall let you 
study it for twenty seconds; that is a very short time. 
Please try to learn it so that you can write the symbol for 
each letter.” 
Then present the appropriate card for code (a), allow the 
subject twenty seconds for observation, and immediately 
thereafter have him reproduce the symbols for the letters 
as given on the record sheet under the test. (See Fig. B, 
p01) 
This part having been completed, present in similar 
fashion the card for part (b), the number code. Allow 
twenty seconds for the learning of the code.. Then have 
the subject reproduce the symbols for the digits as they 
appear on the record sheet. 
Give 8 points credit for correct reproduction in case of 
each part. Give 2 points credit if one error is made. Give 
1 point credit if not more than three errors are made. 
Time for reproduction of each part, 1 minute. 
Test 17. Ball and field (maximum credit, 2 points). 
Present to the subject the broken circle on page 4 of the 
record sheet, saying: ‘“‘If you were told that a ball had 
been knocked into this field and lost in the grass, and you 
ag el
-P-A-G-E-121

had no notion as to the direction from which it came, or 
where it may have landed, how could you most quickly 
and easily find it? Show me on this paper what path you 
would follow in searching for it.” Have the subject trace 
a path in the circle which appears on page 4 of the record 
sheet. 
Give 2 points credit for an inward or outward spiral or for 
a systematic back and forth plan (straight or curved path). 
Give 1 point credit for concentric circles or for radii or 
diameters systematically followed. Give no credit for 
anything poorer. 
Time, 2 minutes. 
Test 18. Geometrical construction test (maximum credit, 
4 points). 
Place before the subject the geometrical construction 
eard (Fig. C, p. 102), saying: ‘‘Here is a drawing with a 
number of parts or pieces. If they are properly fitted 
together, they will make a square. Now please take this 
pencil and show me how the parts can be fitted together 
to just fill this square.” (One of the squares on page 4 of 
the record sheet.) 
If the subject does not get the parts properly arranged on 
the first attempt, allow him to try again in the second 
square on the record sheet. 
Give 4 points credit for correct arrangement of the 
parts on first trial. Give 2 points credit for correct ar- 
rangement on second trial. Give 1 point credit if all parts 
are correctly placed, except the two triangles, in the 
second trial. 
Time for first trial, 2 minutes; for second trial, 2 minutes. 
Test 19. Reproduction of diamonds (maximum credit, 
2 points). 
Present squarely before the subject, with the base of the 
card toward him, the pair of diamonds (Fig. C) and say: 
“I wish you to copy these two figures very carefully and 
accurately.” The reproduction should be made on page 4 
of the record sheet in the proper space, with a pencil. The 
subject should not be allowed to move the paper about.

Give 2 points credit for approximate correctness in 
form and size. Give 1 point credit for easily identifi- 
able reproduction of form but failure to reproduce the 
relative sizes. 
Time, 1 minute. 
Test 20. Memory for designs (maximum credit, 4 
points). 
Say to the subject: ‘““I am going to show you a pair of 
drawings. After you have looked at them for ten seconds, 
I shall take them away and ask you to draw both of them 
from memory. Look at them very carefully.” Then pre- 
sent for ten seconds the card bearing the two designs (Fig. 
C). Have the subject reproduce the designs with pencil in 
the space provided on page 4 of the record sheet. 
Give 2 points credit for correct and accurate reproduction 
of (a) or (b). Give 1 point credit for (a) or (6) if a minor 
imperfection appears, such as the omission of the cross 
lines or their introduction in the wrong figure. 
Time, 2 minutes. 
GENERAL RESULTS OF APPLICATION OF SCALE 
   
   
    
    
    
     To the following expert examiners who have generously 
aided us, we take pleasure in expressing our obligation and 
our thanks: Drs. Helen T. Woolley, Thomas H. Haines, 
R. H. Sylvester, Josephine N. Curtis, Mabel R. Fernald, 
Frederick L. Wells, Miss Rose 8S. Hardwick, and Mr. 
Willard L. Smith. 
As it is our intention to use our data (both measurements 
and criticisms) as the basis for a revision of the scale which 
will be reported later, we shall present in this connection 
only the ranges of scores and the averages for various 
groups of subjects. These will serve examiners temporarily 
as rough norms or standards to regulate expectation. 
For a group of twenty-three women in the reformatory 
at Bedford Hills, New York, the adult scores ranged from 
14 to 61 points. The relation of these scores to the pre- 
adolescent scores are exhibited in table 23 (1).

Similarly the range for a group of thirty-three high-grade 
pupils in the School for the Feeble-minded at Waverley, 
Massachusetts, is 18 to 59 points. Few of these individuals 
would be in the school except for affective peculiarities 
and resulting delinquencies. Table 24 (2) presents the 
scores for the group. 
It is to be noted that the ratios of the adult score to the 
pre-adolescent score are nearly the same: .48 : 1.00 for the 
Bedford Hills group and .51 : 1.00 for the Waverley group. 
The conclusion indicated is that for subjects of medium 
to poor intelligence the adult score will be approximately 
one-half the pre-adolescent score.

and 5.48. The writers state that ‘‘(1) We are justified 
in concluding for the groups in question that the college men, 
with respect to the majority of intellectual functions 
measured by the point-scale method, rank higher than the 
college women. (2) That the superiority of the men is 
especially marked in tests which involve reasoning or other 
fairly complex thought processes,' while the sex differences 
are least for tests of perception, memory, and imagination. 
(3) That a slightly higher percentage (16 per cent.) of the 
women are of subnormal intelligence than of the men (12 
per cent.). (4) That the correlation of point scale measure- 
ments with educational performance is strikingly positive 
for the group of men observed and somewhat less so for the 
group of women.”’ 
SUGGESTIONS FOR REVISION OF ADOLESCENT-ADULT POINT 
SCALE 
On use of this intelligence examination with the varied 
adolescent and adult groups listed on pages 114ff and detailed 
statistical study of data for 226 cases, the following proposals 
for the revision and improvement of the scale are based. 
The principal changes aside from directions for adminis- 
tration are presented in tabular arrangement on p. 119. 
They include rearrangement of tests, omission of three and 
substitution of others, and readjustment of grades. 
The use of tests 2, 14 and 19 is contraindicated by results. 
Test 2, comparison of weights, is obviously unfair to many 
manual laborers. Test 14, ingenuity, is sex differentiating 
and therefore unsatisfactory in this scale. It is also too 
difficult, as indicated by failure of 62 per cent. of subjects 
to score. Test 19, reproduction of diamonds, is too easy 
and fails to distribute subjects. 
1 It is suggested that the sex difference apparent in the results may not bea 
real sex difference since the two colleges draw quite different classes of 
students. The men’s college is a typical New England “College of Liberal 
Arts” whereas the women’s college is distinctly a technical school. 
2 “Subnormal”’ here means the group of individuals who received a coeffi- 
cient of intelligence between 0.71 and 0.90 where the expected score (used as 
a divisor) was taken as the mean score for their sex.

Definitions (test 8 originally) also is difficult to score 
and possibly should be combined later with Test 1 since 
the same intellectual processes are involved. The average 
score for parts is 1.40, 1.19, 1.25, .938. This indicates that 
b and ¢ should be interchanged if order of increasing 
difficulty is desired, so that the order would read. ‘house, 
honesty, door, conceit.” 
Digits forward (test 3 originally) is a useful type of 
memory test, easily administered, and as easily graded. 
The average score for parts is 1.0, .83, .62, .31, .18. Itis 
recommended that one trial only be given.
-P-A-G-E-128
  120 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
Comprehension of questions (test 7 originally) offers 
opportunity for improvement. The average score for parts 
is .73, .85, .88, .55, .75. It is suggested that the number 
of questions be reduced to four, that question b be placed 
first, question c second, and that ‘“‘Why is wastefulness 
wrong?” and ‘‘Why should a person accused of a crime 
be treated as if innocent until proved guilty?” be used 
as the third and fourth questions. The credit for excel- 
lent answers should be two points each and for rela- 
tively unsatisfactory, though partially correct answers, 
one point each. 
Free association (not in original series) is offered as a 
supplementary test. It is suggested that it be used as in 
the Pre-adolescent Scale, page 42, with the following rules 
for crediting response: 50 to 65 words, 1 point; 66 to 80 
words, 2 points; 81 to 95 words, 3 points; 96 to 110 words, 
4 points; 111 to 125 words, 5 points. 
Suggestibility (originally test 4) gives promise of useful 
development. The picture should be black and white 
since the colors are difficult to reproduce, fade, soil, and 
also are differently perceived in accordance with nature of 
color vision. Substitute for the colored picture thus far 
used has not been selected. The original questions demand 
revision as follows: 2 should read: ‘‘Was there a little boy 
with the woman?”; 7, “‘Was there a basket on the woman’s 
arm?”; 8, ““Was the basket empty?”; 13, ‘‘Was the knife 
in the butcher’s hand a large one?”; 14, ‘‘Did you notice 
the cat?” 
The frequency of resistance by 226 subjects to the several 
questions follows: Question No. 2—200; No. 4—179; 
No. 10—152; No. 12—177; No. 14—217; No. 16—159; 
No. 18—181; No. 20—152. 
It is recommended that the credit be reduced from a 
maximum of 5 to 4 points, and that 4 points be given for 
resistance of all suggestions as indicated by correct state- 
ment or “‘I don’t know;” that 3 points be given for resis- 
tance of 9 of the 10 suggestions; 2 points for the resistance 
of 8; one point for the resistance of 7. 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
    SUGGESTIONS FOR REVISION OF ‘SCALE 121 
Observation and report (not originally used) is suggested 
as a means of further utilizing the materials and results of 
the suggestibility test. The ten questions with odd 
numbers 1 to 19 may be scored in accordance with cor- 
rectness of response and the results credited as follows 
Maximum credit, 4 points, given if all the questions are 
correctly answered; credit of 3 points if nine answers 
are correct; 2 points if eight are correct; 1 point if seven 
are correct. 
Analogies (test 10 originally) should be shortened by the 
omission of part d, thus reducing maximum" credit to 5 
points. The average score by parts is .72, .93, .70, .48, 
.42, .48. This indicates, as order of increasing difficulty, 
(omitting part d), b, a, c, f, e. This order is recommended. 
Response to pictures (test 1 originally) is retained with 
the suggestion that part ¢ be omitted and that credit be 
given as follows: for enumeration of parts, nothing; for 
description involving 5 to 10 correct items, 1 point; for 
excellent description involving more than 10 correct items, 2 
points; for correct interpretation, 1 point; maximum score 
for each part, 3 points; for the test, 6 points. 
The examiner should present the picture to the subject 
with the request ‘‘Please describe this picture as well as 
you can and tell me what it means.” 
Relational test (originally 12) is retained because of 
obviously valuable results, ease and accuracy of crediting. 
It is suggested that the credit for part d be increased from 1 
to 2 points, thus making the maximum score for the test 5 
points. This change is indicated by the average score for 
parts, namely, 1.82, 1.66, 1.33, .33. 
Memory for sentences is seemingly satisfactorily 
arranged, the average score by parts being .98, .92, .66, 
.31, .14. One minor change is suggested, the substitution 
in part d of ‘‘softened” for ‘‘melted.” 
Box test (test 13 originally) makes such a good showing 
that the addition of a part and increase of score from 4 to 5 
points are recommended. The average scores for parts 
are .80, .71, .52,.48. It isrecommended that there be added   
-P-A-G-E-130
  122 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
as part e ‘‘a large box containing five smaller boxes with five 
inside of each.” 
Absurdities (test 9 originally) may well be reduced to 
four parts by the omission of part e, with reduction of score 
to 4 points and rearrangement of parts to read c, d, b, a in 
accordance with the average scores for parts which are 
.69, .72, .84, .76, .84. 
Opposites (test 11 originally) contains a few unsatis- 
factory words for which substitutes are suggested. The 
revised list arranged roughly in order of increasing difficulty 
of response is upper, cheap, after, top, easy, silent, rough, 
vacant, wise, many, joy, prompt, distant, beautiful, gener- 
ous, idle, polite, never, similar, lazy. 
It is recommended that the maximum score be increased 
from 4 to 5 points with credit as follows: 5 points for 
correct response to each of the 20 words; 4 points for 17-19 
correct; 3 points for 14-16 correct; 2 points for 11-13 
correct; 1 point for 8-10 correct. 
Digits backward (not in original series) promises to be a 
useful supplement to the scale. It is recommended that 
five parts be used as indicated below and that 1 point credit 
be given for each part. The directions for test 3, digits 
forward, apply also to this test.. 
(a) 8-7 
(6) 2+ 
Letter line (test 15 originally). This test has thus far 
been little used and is in relatively unsatisfactory status. 
Its retention is suggested with the reduction of score from 
4 to 2 points, credits to be assigned as follows: for correct 
order or for reversal of Y and V, 2 points; for reversal of any 
two of the pairs VY, LY, HN, HV, 1 point; for anything 
poorer, no credit. 
Code (test 16 originally). It is suggested that the 
maximum credit be increased to 8 points in accordance 
with the following rule applicable to each part of test: all
-P-A-G-E-131
  SUGGESTIONS FOR REVISION OF SCALE 123 
correct, 4 points; one error, 3 points; two or three errors, 2 
points; four or five errors, 1 point. The subject should not 
be permitted to draw the code figure from memory. 
Ball and field (test 17 originally). Results do not indi- 
cate satisfactory distribution of scores for this test and 
it is therefore recommended that the credit be reduced from 
4 to 2 points and assigned as follows: for spiral path, radii, 
concentric circles, or any other highly efficient logical 
plan, 2 points; for less efficient plan, 1 point; for random 
search, no credit. 
Geometric construction (test 18 originally). As origin- 
ally graded the test is too difficult. The following changes 
are suggested: for correct response in first trial, 4 points; 
correct in second trial, 3 points; correct in first trial except 
for misplacement of triangles, 2 points; correct in second 
trial except for misplacement of triangles, 1 point; no credit 
for anything poorer. 
Memory for designs (test 20 originally) retained without 
suggestions for change.

CHAPTER 6 
THE INFANT POINT SCALE 
At the request of Dr. Yerkes, Dr. J. N. Curtis undertook 
the accumulation of data for the formulation of a point scale 
which could be used with children under seven years of age 
and which would thus supplement the Pre-adolescent Point 
Seale. The work was begun in January, 1917, and was 
discontinued in May, 1919, when Dr. Curtis left Boston. 
For various reasons the material thus gathered was at that 
time worked over only hastily, and it is published here for 
the first time. 
The majority of subjects used were children of the kinder- 
gartens and the first three grades of the public schools of 
Cambridge, Massachusetts.1 Some little additional work 
was done on children in day nurseries, in settlement houses, 
and in a large children’s hospital. Most of the records of 
the hospital cases are incomplete since the children were 
surgical cases and were on this account unable to perform 
certain of the tests. Complete records were obtained upon 
the following group:

In cases where it was perfectly clear to the examiner that 
the child had a language handicap so great as to preclude 
1 Throughout the work, Mr. M. E. Fitzgerald, Superintendent of Schools 
in Cambridge, was most kind and in every way of the greatest assistance.

126 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
the possibility of his understanding even simple ques- 
tions, the record was discarded. There seemed to be no 
reason for excluding the records of negroes, since the colored 
children found in Massachusetts are easily the equals of 
many of the Portuguese and other races included in our 
group. Record was kept, so far as possible, of the ‘‘social 
status” of the family, either from the opinion of the teacher 
or judged from the father’s occupation. Such classification 
is, of course, very rough since, as one teacher pointed out, a 
family which was ‘‘average’’ or even ‘“‘superior” for her 
group of children would be considered distinctly inferior 
in a school situated in the University district of Cambridge. 
That the children examined came from families of many 
conditions is shown by the statement of the Superintendent 
of Schools about the schools used: ‘‘School A, mostly 
Polish families with some Greeks; School B, medium 
circumstances, quite a colored element; School C, medium 
circumstances; Schools D and E, fortunate parents; 
School F, very fortunate parents; School: G, Lithuanian, 
Italian, Greeks; School H, large percentage of Italians; 
School I, large percentage of Portuguese; Schools J and K, 
parents in comfortable circumstances.” 
The experimenters were experienced examiners and 
included, besides Dr. Curtis, Misses Frances Bean, Kather- 
ine T. Gere, Josephine R. Glascock, Doris Holmes, Mary 
E. Hoover, Elizabeth Lord, and Doris E. Perry, all psycho- 
logical internes at the Psychopathic Hospital, Boston. 
The examination was purposely made too long so that 
in the end the tests which proved to be poorest could be 
discarded. The tests which have been selected from the 
group as most significant and which are therefore recom- 
mended as making up a preliminary Infant Point Scale 
are twenty-two in number and are given below. In 
order to facilitate the shifting from this scale to the pre- 
adolescent scale, and from the pre-adolescent to the infant 
scale, some of the tests of the more advanced scale have 
been embodied in the infant scale, and many others have 
been given simpler parts. By such an arrangement, if we
-P-A-G-E-135
  
THE INFANT POINT SCALE 127 
start a child on the infant scale and find him passing all 
the parts of several tests, his successes may be simply 
transferred to the pre-adolescent scale and we may con- 
tinue on that scale without loss of time. In addition to the 
tests taken over from the pre-adolescent scale, there have 
been included numerous tests from the Stanford revision of 
the Binet (with or without modification), six of the Porteus 
labyrinths, a card of pictures published by C. H. Stoelting 
as No. 77534—B, and a modification of the Knox cube test. 
DIRECTIONS FOR GIVING AND SCORING THE INFANT POINT 
SCALE 
Test 1. (a) ‘What is your name?” If the subject does 
not reply, ask ‘‘Is your name John? (or Mary, or any other 
common name).’’ If only the first name is given, ask 
“Henry what?” If no reply, ask “Is it Henry Smith? 
(or any other common name).” 
(b) ‘‘How old are you?” 
(c) “Are you a little boy or a little girl?” 
Give 1 point credit for each part answered correctly. 
Highest possible score is 3. 
Test 2. Pre-adolescent aesthetic comparison cards. 
“Which is the prettier (or prettiest) of these two faces?” If 
no reply, ask ‘“‘Which one do you like the better (or best)?” 
Show both arrangements of the faces, as in the pre- 
adolescent scale. 
Give 1 point credit for one pair of correct judgments, and 
2 points for two or three pairs of correct judgments. 
Highest possible score is 2. 
Test 3.—‘‘Is this morning or afternoon?” (or if the test 
is given in the afternoon, ask ‘‘/s this afternoon or morning ?’’) 
Give 1 point credit for the correct reply. 
Test 4. Points to nose, mouth, elbow, wrist. ‘Show 
me your nose”’ or ‘Put your finger on your nose.” If no 
reply, point to the child’s eye and ask ‘Is this your nose? 
Then where is your nose?” With the older children, if 
elbow and wrist are located correctly, the easier parts of 
. the test need not be given. 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
128 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
Give 1 point credit for each part given correctly. 
Highest possible score is 4. 
Test 5. Response to pictures. Use the pictures from 
the Stanford revision of the Binet. Show the Dutch 
Home. ‘Look at this picture and tell me about it.” If the 
subject replies, go on to the River Scene. If no reply, say 
“Show me the little girl. Now tell me some more about 
it.’ Whether the child replies then or not, do not count 
the answer if this assistance has been given, but go on to 
the other two pictures. The plan is to record the replies 
of the subject for two pictures where no help has been given. 
The Post Office is given only when the subject has failed 
on the Dutch Home. 
For each of two pictures reported without prompting, 
give 1 point for good enumeration or very poor description, 
and 2 points for good description and interpretation. 
“Dutch” and “Indian” alone do not count as interpreta- 
tion. Highest possible score is 4. 
Test 6. Repetition of sentences. 
(a) “Papa.” 
“Come in.” 
(b) ‘It is cold and snowing.” 
“Place the book on the chair.” 
(c) ‘His name is Jack. Oh, what a naughty boy.” 
“The path of the moon lies across the sky.” 
(d) ‘We are having a fine time. We found a mouse in 
the trap.” “‘Let’s all go for a walk to-day. Please give 
me that big hat to wear.” 
Say “Papa.” If this is failed say “Come in.” If 
both are failed, do not go on. If either is given correctly, 
go on to part (6). Here, also give a second trial if the first 
is failed. Continue with the test until both trials of some 
part are failed. 
Give 1 point credit for each part passed. Highest 
possible score is 4. 
Test 7. Discrimination of Forms.— Use the material from 
the Stanford revision of the Binet. Place the circle of 
the duplicate set at X and say “Show me one like this,” at
-P-A-G-E-137
THE INFANT POINT SCALE 129 
the same time passing the finger around the circumference 
of the circle. If no reply, say ‘‘Do you see all these 
things?” (running the finger over the various forms) “‘and 
do you see this one?’’ (pointing again to the circle) “now 
find me another one just like this one.” If the subject 
replies, go on to the square, triangle, and others; if no 
reply to the circle, point it out to the child and then 
go on to the others. 
For 1 to 5 successes, give 1 point credit: 6 to 8 successes, 
2 points; and 9 or 10 successes, 3 points. Highest possible 
score is 3. 
Test 8. Porteus mazes (numbers as printed by Stoelting, 
78703, 78704, 78705, 78706, 78707, and 78708). Start 
by showing the 3-year test, and while speaking trace around 
the figure with the eraser end of a pencil. Say ‘‘ Take 
this pencil and draw a line around here, between these two lines. 
Be sure you keep between these lines.” Use the same instruc- 
tions for the 4 and 5-year tests. For the 6-year test, 
“Now in this one, if you start here, you can get out either 
here or here (pointing), and you can’t get out at the other 
places because they are closed. What I want you to do is to 
take the pencil, start here (pointing), and draw a line that 
will come out here (pointing to the first opening). Be sure 
to stay between the lines.” For the 7-year test, ‘‘Now do 
the same thing here. Start here, and go this way (indicating 
direction) and come out at the very first opening.” (Do not 
in this test indicate the proper opening.) If the child 
starts in the wrong direction, correct him. For the 8- 
year test say “‘Now start here and find the way out without 
going up any passages that are closed.’ If the child fails the 
first three tests entirely, the last three need not be given. 
Do not repeat any test, but unless there is a hopeless failure, 
go on to the next harder one. 
Allow three crossings and returns in each of the first 
three labyrinths. Give credit for the most difficult 
maze passed whether or not easier ones are failed. Thus, if 
the first three are passed, the fourth failed, the fifth passed, 
and the sixth failed, the subject receives a credit of 5, 
9 
   
-P-A-G-E-138
130 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
since the fifth is the most difficult maze which he passed 
Highest possible score is 6. 
Test 9. Comparison of Lines.—Use pre-adolescent scale 
material. ‘‘Which is the longer (or longest) of these two 
lines?” Present the card both sides up. 
Give 1 point credit if both trials are passed correctly. 
Highest possible score is 1. 
Test 10. Repetition of Digits. 
(a) 7D 8-3 2-9 
(b) 6-4-1 (5D) ge358 
(c) 5-8-6-3 6-9-7-4 [2s

(e) 5-7-2-6-1-4 628-827-255 4-6-9-5-3-2 
“Listen. Say 7-2.” If this part is passed, go on to part 
(b). If the first trial on (2) is failed, give the second, and, 
if necessary, the third trial. Continue the test until all 
three trials for some one part have been failed. 
Give 1 point credit for each part in which the child 
passes one of the three trials. Highest possible score is 5. 
Test 11. Missing Parts.—Use the pre-adolescent scale 
material. ‘What is missing from this picture of a lady?” 
If no reply, ask ‘‘Has she a head? Well, what is gone?” 
If no reply, ask ‘‘Has she any arms?” If this is answered 
correctly, record that help was given, and give no credit 
for the part. Whether this is passed or failed, go on to the 
faces and ask for each “‘ What is missing from this face?” If 
the child answers ‘“‘ Body,” say ‘“‘ Yes, and what is gone from 
just the face?” Do not help in these latter parts of the 
test. 
Give 1 point for each part passed. Highest possible 
score is 4. 
Test 12. Comparison of Weights.—Use the 3 and 15 gm. 
weights from the set used in the pre-adolescent scale. 
Place the blocks before the child and say ‘‘ Which is the 
heavier (or heaviest) of these two blocks?” Present with 
the heavier at the right, then at the left. If the child 
merely points, say ‘‘Lift them up and tell me which is 
the heavier.”  
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE INFANT POINT SCALE 131 
Give 1 point credit if the correct reply is given in both 
trials. Highest possible score is 1. 
Test 13. Definitions. 
I. (a) ‘What is a spoon?” 
(b) ‘What is a chair?” 
(c) “What is a hat?” 
(d) ‘What is bread?” 
Il. (a) ‘What do we write with?” 
(b) “What do we wear on our feet?” 
(c) “Where do we sleep at night?” 
III. Names: key, penny, watch, closed knife, table, floor, 
pencil. 
If excellent answers are given in Part I, the other parts 
need not be given. 
In Part I, give 1 point for each definition in terms of use, 
material, description, or enumeration of parts; give 2 
points for definitions in terms of “what,” “‘thing,” ‘‘some- 
thing,” ‘‘that” or a real classification or ‘‘superior to use”’ 
reply. In Part I, give 1 point for each correct answer. In 
part III, give 1 point if at least six of the objects are 
named. Highest possible score is 12. 
Test 14. Repeats digits backwards. 
(a) 8-5 7-4 1-6 
(b) 3-2-9 2-6-5 Sasa 
(e). 4271-8 3-9-2-7 2-8-5-9 
(Gd) G3 9-2-6-5-1 7-4-8-5-3 
“T am going to say some numbers to you and I want you 
to say them backwards to me. Now say this backwards, 8-5.” 
If this is passed, go on to part (b) but if it is failed give one 
or, if necessary, both of the other trials for (a). Continue 
the test until all three trials of some part have been failed. 
Give 1 point credit for each part in which one of the 
trials is reversed correctly. Highest possible score is 4. 
Test 15. Memory for Pictures.—Use Stoelting card No. 
77534. “I am going to show you a card with lots of pictures 
on it. Look at it carefully for after you have seen it for a 
very short time (30 sec.) I am going to take it away and then 
I want you to tell me what you saw.”
-P-A-G-E-140
  132 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
For 1 to 3 pictures recalled, give 1 point credit; for 4 
to 6, 2 points; and for 7 or more, 3 points. Bevery lenient. 
Count as correct for the cat, ‘‘bear” “dog” or almost any 
other animal; for the plant, “‘tree,”’ ete. Highest possible

(f) 1-42-83 
Use the set of five weights from the pre-adolescent scale 
material. Arrange the four heaviest blocks in a row 
between the childand yourself. Take the lightest block and 
tap the first one in the row (the one at your right). Give 
the block to the child and say “‘ Now you do just what I did.” 
With some inattentive children it may be necessary to 
say “Look” or ‘Watch me’ at the beginning. If the 
subject fails to respond, repeat and urge him to tap the 
block. Whether this part is passed or not, give no credit, 
but go on with part (a) saying ‘‘ Now do this” (tapping the 
four blocks in the order indicated above). If the subject 
   
-P-A-G-E-141
THE INFANT POINT SCALE 133 
fails in all of the first three parts, the last three need not 
be given. Do not give the subject any hint that you are 
thinking of the blocks by numbers. 
Give 1 point credit for each part performed correctly. 
Highest possible score is 6. 
Test 18. Comprehension of questions. 
(a) ‘What must you do when you are sleepy?” 
(6) ‘‘What must you do when you are cold?” 
(c) ‘“What must you do when you are hungry?” 
(d) ““What’s the thing to do if it is raining when you 
start to school?” 
(e) ‘‘What’s the thing to do if you find your house is on 
fire?” 
(f) “If you were going somewhere and you missed your 
train, what should you do?” 
(g) ‘“‘What’s the thing to do if you have broken something 
that belongs to someone else?” 
(h) ‘If someone has been unkind to you and says he is 
sorry, what should you do?” 
If the first three parts are not understood, the form of 
question may be changed to ‘‘ Well, what do you do when 
you are —?” 
Give 1 point credit to each of (a), (6), (c), and (d) which 
is answered reasonably well (don’t be too strict); give 2 
points credit for each excellent answer to (e), (f), (g), and 
(h); and 1 point for answers to these last four parts which 
show some comprehension of the situation. Highest 
possible score is 12. 
Test 19. Color patterns. 
(a) R-R-R-R 
(6) G-Y-G-Y 
(c) R-Y-P-R-Y-P 
(d) B-~Y-B-R-B-Y—B-R 
The materials for this test are colored kindergarten sticks 
(such as those furnished by the Milton Bradley Co.) 
using ten each of red, yellow, green, blue, and purple. 
Place the pile of mixed sticks before the child. ‘‘ Watch 
what I am doing.” Place four red sticks close beside each
-P-A-G-E-142
134 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
other. ‘‘Now you make me some more like that.” If the 
child continues to place red sticks along side until he has 
placed five or six, pass on to the next part. If he fails to 
understand, correct his error, and say ‘‘ Now I have placed 
all these that look alike side by side, now you keep doing 
that.’ If there is success after help, do not give credit, 
but pass on to part (0); if the child fails in (a) even after 
assistance has been given, the other parts of the test need 
not be given. In giving parts (6), (c), (d), be sure to form 
the pattern twice as is indicated above. 
Give 1 point for each part arranged with not more than 
one error or inversion. Highest possible score is 4. 
Test 20. Commands. 
(a) Stand up, move block, clap hands. 
(b) Give pencil, place one block on the other. 
Place a block at one end of the table within reach of the 
child when he stands up, but not so near that he can reach 
it more easily when he is sitting. ‘Now I want you to do 
three things for me: first, stand up, then move this block over 
here (pointing to a place which the subject can reach 
without walking around), then clap your hands (gesture). 
First stand up, then move this block over here, then clap your 
hands. All right. Go ahead.” If this first command is 
obeyed exactly do not go on. If there is any mistake, 
record the part as failed, and say ‘‘Now I want you to do 
some more things for me. First give me the pencil, and 
then put this block on top of this one (gesture). ° Do you 
understand? First give me the pencil, and then put this 
block on top of this one.” Have the blocks and pencil 
placed beside each other, so that there is no suggestion 
- from their positions as to which should be touched first. 
Give 2 points credit if (a) is passed; give 1 point credit if 
(a) is failed, but (b) is passed. Highest possible score is 2. 
Test 21. Copying Drawings.—Use the square and the 
diamond from the pre-adolescent scale, and draw upon a 
similar cardboard a circle of the same general dimensions 
as the square. ‘‘ You see that (pointing to the circle). J 
want you to make one just like it. Make it right here.” If
-P-A-G-E-143
THE INFANT POINT SCALE 135 
the drawing is very poor, or if the child is obviously dis- 
satisfied with his performance, allow him two more trials. 
In a like manner, present the square and diamond. If 
the circle or square is utterly failed, the more difficult forms 
need not be, given. 
Give 1 point credit for any poor reproduction, such as an 
irregular oval for (a), a rectangle for (b), or a diamond with 
unequal sides for (c). Give 2 points for each figure which 
is reproduced correctly. Highest possible score is 6. 
Test 22. Drawings from Memory.—The figure for this 
test is an equilateral triangle whose sides are each two 
inches in length, and whose two legs are each extended two 
inches above the apex. 
Give 1 point credit for any similar figure, such as the 
same figure inverted, the figure with rounded corners, etc. 
Give 2 points for an excellent reproduction. Highest 
possible score is 2. 
The highest possible score on the entire examination is 
100. 
The examination as given above is much shorter than the 
one which was tried out. Tests were discarded for many 
different reasons: because they showed little change in 
score with advancing chronological age; because they gave 
results which were practically identical with those of other 
parts of the same test; because they proved too difficult 
for any except unusually bright children of the higher ages; 
and so on. It seems hardly worth while here to go into 
detail as to the reasons for abandoning any test, but we 
shall list parts which were dropped. They were: In 
test 4, pointing to hair, neck and eyes; in test 6, sentences 
intermediate in length between those retained and four 
very long sentences; in test 12, arranging three weights 3, 9 
and 15 in order of weight; in test 13, ‘‘What is a horse? 
a baby? What do we ride on? What do we eat with? 
What do we read from?” and of a number of presented 
objects, selecting certain ones asked for; in test 14, series 
of six digits; in test 16, ‘‘a ball is round, a pencil is . 
At school there is a teacher, at church there is a

Dust is dry, mud is . . . Wood floats, iron. . . If 
you hold a stone up and let go it drops to the ground, if you 
hold a balloon up and let go . . .; in test 17, sequences 
1-3-2-4-3, 1-4-3-2-4, and 1-3-1—2-4; in test 21, a triangle 
and in test 22, the usual Binet memory drawings. 
In the last few months of work, an additional very easy 
absurdities test was tried out, but since at that time the 
work was mainly with the younger children, not enough 
data could be gathered on the older children to justify its 
inclusion in the scale. The experimenters felt sure, how- 
ever, that simple absurdities would be satisfactory for use 
with young children. The ones which were suggested for 
the infant scale were: 
1. My cat has seven feet. 
. Fred ate tin cans for his breakfast. 
. Mary’s cat is bigger than an elephant. 
. The dog has bright eyes in his tail. 
Red ink makes a black mark. 
. Big boys are smaller than small boys. 
Boys wear ribbons on their hair. 
. The color of my brown horse is gray. 
. John is a tall girl. 
10. Pencils would write better if the lead were painted 
white. 
11. The silver in Elsie’s ring is.a very pretty red. 
12. I saw a very heavy horse the other day. He weighed 
two and a half pounds. 
13. My brother’s little boy is 65 years old. 
14. Tom’s school begins at 9 o’clock and ends two hours 
later at 12 o’clock. 
15. Mrs. Smith told Henry to find some warm ice to 
skate on so he would not be cold. 
Records on this test were obtained from 66 children. 
Of these, ten 3-year olds, sixteen 4-year olds, twenty-eight 
5-year olds, and three 6-year olds failed the test entirely. 
The following children passed some of the parts. One 4- 
year old child passed part 1, one passed 1, 2, 3, 4 (?), 6, 7, 
9, 12, and one passed 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 13 (?). One 5-year
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE INFANT POINT SCALE 137 
old child passed test 1, one passed 1, 4, 6 and 7, one passed 
1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, one passed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 
and 10 and one passed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10. One 6- 
year old child passed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. 
We have, then, out of ten 3-year old children, 100 per 
cent. failing all the absurdities; out of nineteen 4-year olds, 
sixteen, or 84 per cent. failing them all; out of thirty-three 
5-year olds, twenty-eight, or 85 per cent. failing; and of the 
6-year olds we have only four cases, so it is obviously 
unfair to conclude that 75 per cent. would fail ordinarily. 
Perhaps the test is not suited for even six years, but there 
surely is an opportunity for an absurdities test-less difficult 
than the ones ordinarily given and applicable to children 
somewhere between the ages of 5 and 9. 
In considering the results from this scale we must remem- 
ber that there are a number of factors which make for 
variability in the results of young children. In the first 
place, at these early ages, home conditions are of much 
greater importance than they appear to be later, for the 
children from superior families are in general taught much 
more at home than the children whose parents have less 
leisure and less interest in a child’s development. In 
the later years, the less favored children pick up in school 
many things which the other children have already acquired 
at home. In the compilation of the scale we have endeav- 
ored to minimize certain sources of variability. It is 
difficult to hold the attention of small children through a 
long set of directions, and therefore we have used in so far 
as is possible tests which are direct questions and which 
require no previous explanation. Very young children 
are generally much more shy than their older companions, 
and we therefore allow more trials in any test than we need 
offer to the older children. 
The statistical results obtained upon this preliminary 
form of an infant scale are not sufficiently numerous to 
warrant detailed analysis or discussion. The scale seems, 
however, to be fairly satisfactory for children between the 
ages of 3 and 6 who can use simple English. The scores 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  138 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
for chronological age 7 and for the few 8-year olds who were 
examined are little above those for year 6, and the scale is, 
therefore, not recommended for use above 6 years. The 
distribution of total scores by half-years in chronological 
age is given in condensed form in table 26.

Ladies and Gentlemen: I have several important reasons 
for wishing to discuss this particular methodological aspect 
of psychology at this time and in this institution. Human 
engineering on the basis of mental measurement is progress- 
ing so rapidly that we have cause to doubt the adequacy of 
our methods. We face the fact of the almost universal 
application of such methods of measuring intelligence as the 
Binet and Point Scales, yet these measuring instruments 
are extremely crude and at the same time obviously 
improvable. It is equally our duty and our opportunity 
so to modify or replace them that our results shall steadily 
increase in accuracy and reliability. As it happens the 
three men who have done most to adapt the Binet scale 
to American needs and to improve it—Kuhlmann, God- 
dard, and Terman—as students in this institution have 
enjoyed the privilege of working under the guidance of 
the foremost of genetic psychologists. 
The profound significance of natural science for civiliza- 
tion is no longer seriously questioned. The world war has 
convinced us, on the one hand, that the physical sciences 
are far in advance of the biological and social sciences, and 
on the other hand, that there is imperative need of system- 
atic attention to the latter group of sciences. Many of 
us are wholly convinced that the future of mankind depends 
in no small measure upon the development of the various 
biological and social sciences. Among these physiology, 
psychology, and sociology are preéminently important. We

must, I submit, if we are adequately to meet after-war 
demands and improve the opportunities which will then 
be offered us, strive unceasingly for the improvement of 
our methods of mental measurement, for there is no longer 
ground for doubt concerning the practical as well as the 
theoretical importance of studies of human behavior. 
We must learn to measure skilfully every form and aspect 
of behavior which has psychological and sociological sig- 
nificance. Such are a few of my reasons for wishing to 
compare critically the two most prominent methods of 
measuring intelligence. 
These methods are too well known to demand historical 
introduction. Although each is at present widely used, 
they differ radically in principle and might reasonably be 
expected to yield strikingly different results. Measure- 
ments of intellectual forms and aspects of behavior are of 
two principal sorts: (1) the scale or group-test procedure, 
‘and (2) the single or specific functional measurement. 
Both the Binet and the Point Scale are groups of tests. 
It is essential for us, at the beginning of this discussion, to 
note that for scientific purposes the ideal method of measur- 
ing behavior is the specific functional test. Scales are 
technological tools which have been devised to satisfy 
certain practical demands. The inevitable direction of 
development in our mental measuring is toward the graded, 
standardized, highly accurate, specific test or method. 
Groups of tests or, as it is convenient to call them, scales, 
are likely to persist and multiply because they will con- 
tinue in increasing measure to meet important human 
needs. 
But even now we may appropriately ask, should both the 
Binet and the Point Scale methods be further developed 
and improved, should the one or the other be wholly 
abandoned, should both be given up and in their place a 
new type of scale embodying perhaps the best principles of 
each be created, or, as yet another possibility, should the 
grouping of tests be abandoned and recourse be had to 
highly developed single functional tests? 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  150 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
At the risk of seeming to reverse logical procedure, I wish 
at once to suggest my tentative answer to these questions, 
for after all, this discussion may be endured only for the 
sake of the conclusions. I believe, in the first place, that 
scales or ‘groups of tests cannot well be dispensed with. 
I further believe that we should concentrate our efforts 
on the development of reliable methods of measuring the 
various types and aspects of practically significant human 
behavior. In order to fulfill the conditions which these 
two conclusions impose upon us, I wish to suggest the 
desirability and the feasibility of developing a scale for 
the measurement of intelligence which shall at once combine 
the safe and serviceable principles of the Binet and Point 
Systems and improve upon them. This new scale should 
take account alike of the qualitative and quantitative 
aspects of behavior. It should consist of carefully selected 
and graded tests. 1t should be standardized in such wise 
that its constituent parts might be used independently, 
thus serving the purpose of specific functional tests. It 
should be possible to embody in a single scale all the 
advantages of existing methods of measuring intelligence, 
and even to add to them. 
There are those who insist that the Binet and Point Scales 
are not essentially different. It has even been said, care- 
lessly, that the latter is merely a revision of the former 
method. Such statements are surprising indeed in view of 
the facts to which I must now call your attention. 
Careful analysis of the two scales indicate that they 
differ more or less radically on three fundamentally 
important points: (1) the method of selecting or choosing 
their constituent parts (tests of intelligence) ; (2) the method 
of standardizing their tests or combinations of tests; and 
(3) the method of measuring and expressing the subject’s 
response. 
METHOD OF SELECTING TESTS 
The various tests or methods which make up the Binet 
scale are selected in accordance with the number of suc-
-P-A-G-E-159
  METHOD OF SELECTING TESTS 151 
cesses or failures at various ages. If a particular test is 
passed by a certain percentage of individuals at eight years 
of age, by a lower percentage at seven years, and a higher 
percentage at nine years, it is, other things being equal, 
deemed suitable for the eight-year group. It thus appears 
that tests are chosen in the light of success or failure and 
arranged in age groups. This method apparently rests 
upon the assumption that important forms of behavior 
appear at various times during infancy, childhood, and 
adolescence. By contrast, the methods which constitute 
the Point Scale are chosen from the standpoint of functions 
to be measured, and without regard to their particular rela- 
tions to the stages of human development. It is assumed 
in the construction of the Point Scale that all of the impor- 
tant types of intellectual function are present in early child- 
hood and develop more or less rapidly. If this be true, 
tests or measures for all fundamental forms of intellectual 
behavior should be available no matter what the age of 
the subject. Briefly put, the Binet is an age-scale based 
upon the assumption of appearing functions; the Point 
Scale is a functional scale, based upon the assumption of 
developing functions. 
Genetic psychology justifies the statement that all 
important types or classes of intelligent behavior are 
represented in the human action system by the end of the 
third year of postnatal life. Thereafter new acts belonging 
to the same types continue to appear for some years and all 
tend to become complexly related to one another and to 
innate reactive tendencies. 
As one result of the heterogeneity of tests within the 
Binet scale groups, the measurements made on individuals 
of different ages are not strictly comparable, for the obvious 
reason that different forms or aspects of behavior have 
been measured in the two cases. In support of this state- 
ment, I need only contrast the tests which make up the 
five-year and eight-year Stanford-Binet groups. In the 
five-year, there appear (1) comparison of weights; (2) 
naming of colors; (3) aesthetic comparison; (4) definition
-P-A-G-E-160
152 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
by use, or better; (5) patience, or divided rectangle; (6) 
three commissions. The eight-year group consists of 
(1) the ball and field test; (2) counting backward, 20-0; (3) 
comprehension of questions; (4) giving similarities of two 
things; (5) definition superior to use; (6) vocabulary. 
Even the most enthusiastic believer in the Binet scale 
and method cannot hope to maintain the thesis that at 
each or even at any two ages precisely the same forms or 
aspects of human behavior are measured. In the Point 
Seale, it is the ideal, thus far only partially realized, to 
measure the same and the most fundamental features of 
behavior at every age, and thus to obtain strictly compar- 
able results from year to year. 
METHOD OF STANDARDIZATION 
. The Binet Scale is internally standardized; the Point 
Scale, externally. For the former method, the process of 
selecting tests according to percentage of passes and of 
grouping them according to age constitutes standardiza- 
tion. The result of this method of selecting and standard- 
izing tests is an inflexible scale, which, however accurate it 
may be for the race, social stratum, or sex, for which it 
was constructed, cannot possibly yield reliable results 
when applied to widely differing groups of individuals. 
For this reason an internally standardized method of 
measuring behavior is defective. 
The Point Scale may be described as externally standard- 
ized because the selection and arrangement of the tests 
have nothing to do with the norms which as standards of 
judgment are used in the evaluation of results. With the 
application of the Point Scale to increasing numbers of 
individuals, the norms, whether for age, sex, race, educational 
or social status, become increasingly numerous and reliable, 
and the value of the method correspondingly increases. 
In order to use the Point Scale profitably for a new race, or 
social group, it is necessary only to make a sufficient 
number of examinations to yield reliable norms. They 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
METHOD OF MEASURING AND EXPRESSING RESPONSE 153 
immediately become standards of judgment. The method 
does not have to be revised. Thus it is evident that where 
the Binet Scale is inflexible, the Point Scale is flexible and 
universally applicable. 
METHOD OF MEASURING AND EXPRESSING RESPONSE 
The third fundamental difference mentioned above 
appears in the method of measuring and expressing reac- 
tion. The Binet Scale supplies judgments of success or 
failure. These have been described as all-or-none judg- 
ments. From the scientific point of view, they are but 
rough approximations to the desired and desirable measure- 
ment, since they are rather the forerunners of quantitative 
statements than themselves quantitative. In the Point 
Scale, judgments are of the more-or-less sort. In other 
words, there is not a judgment of ‘‘pass”’ or “‘fail,” but 
instead there is awarded a particular amount of credit, 
which supposedly varies in correspondence with the 
character or amount of response. The Binet measurement 
is neither qualitative nor quantitative, but marks the 
transition. The point-scale measurement is distinctly 
quantitative. But in so far as the ideal of point-scale 
construction is achieved, the method takes account of 
qualitative as well as quantitative differences in response. 
The importance of this contrast in the methods which we 
are considering has, I think, been fully appreciated by very 
few critics. Itis, in fact, the difference between a relatively 
unscientific procedure and one which is striving to fulfill the 
essential requirements of scientific method. 
There is, moreover, a profoundly important corollary. 
The type of measurement which the Binet Scale yields is 
amenable to statistical treatment only in a very restricted 
way. Thus the mean or standard deviation, the probable 
error of mean or deviation, the co-efficient of correlation 
with its probable error either cannot be obtained at all for 
Binet judgments or are of slight value because of the non- 
quantitative character of the judgments. By contrast, 
point-scale measurements can be statistically treated in all
-P-A-G-E-162
  154 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
the varied and biologically significant ways. In my opin- 
ion, it is primarily because of this merit, that the Point 
Scale has gained so rapidly its wide recognition and use. 
The advantage which it has, from the statistical standpoint, 
over the Binet method is tremendous, and only those 
persons who are unfamiliar with the essentials of scientific 
method or incapable of appreciating the value of statistical 
data fail to note and respond to this difference. The Point 
Scale because of this characteristic is at once a technological 
tool and an instrument of research. The Binet Scale is 
technologically useful, but possesses little research value. 
WEIGHTING OF TESTS 
It has been objected by some critics, that the point-scale 
system is unsatisfactory because the various tests are 
weighted in the light of no definite scientific principle. 
This adverse criticism I accept as valid, but in fairness it 
must be pointed out that it applies with equal force to 
every other scale whose several measurements are averaged 
or in any other way combined. Thus, for example, the 
Binet Scale gives equal weight to all the tests of a given age 
group, despite the fact that they may be concerned with 
utterly different modes or aspects of response whose practical 
importance in the individual’s life must vary extremely at 
any given time as well as with age and the correlation of 
which with general intelligence is known to vary greatly. 
I submit, not in defense of the point-scale procedure but 
merely in fairness to it, that the Binet Scale is quite as 
much in need of a sound and systematically applied 
principle of weighting as is the Point Scale. 
But ground for defense is not utterly lacking. The 
point-scale tests were not weighted in haphazard fashion. 
Instead, varied experience in actual examining, coefficients 
of correlation with general intelligence and of one type of 
measurement with another were considered and the 
weightings apportioned as carefully as was possible in the 
absence of any single and obviously satisfactory principle.
-P-A-G-E-163
  
CHRONOLOGICAL VERSUS PHYSIOLOGICAL AGE 155 
The principle which we propose to apply in the further 
development and perfecting of the point-scale system is that 
of weighting in correspondence with the correlation of a 
particular measurement with general intelligence, or rather 
with the point-scale score.t. The higher the coefficient of 
correlation, the greater the credit for a particular test. 
This principle we are trying out. If it stands our tests, 
we shall have met our critics squarely, and at the same time 
shall have gone beyond the Binet Scale in regard to 
scientific qualifications. 
CHRONOLOGICAL VERSUS PHYSIOLOGICAL AGE 
Yet another important consideration remains to be men- 
tioned before an attempt is made to sum up the contrasting 
characteristics of the two methods. The use of chrono- 
logical age in connection with mental age as a basis for the 
statement of individual status is scientifically without 
justification. The rapidity of growth and of the maturing 
of organic structures and functions varies greatly for races, 
for individuals for the sexes, for diverse conditions of 
nutrition and of health. It is consequently unsafe to 
compare the status or the achievement of two individuals 
on the basis of their years, months, or days of postnatal 
existence. That psychologists will ultimately be forced 
to admit this fact and to abandon or modify their use of 
chronological age and of mental age in connection with 
measurements of intelligence is my conviction. Physio- 
logical age should be determined and with it the varied 
results of measurement should be compared or correlated. 
This means that in case of each examination there should be 
stated not only the chronological age of the individual but 
also the physiological age as indicated by carefully chosen 
measurements of status of the organism and of functional 
capacity, and finally, the specific results of varied mental 
measurements in comparison with the expected results 
or norms for the appropriate physiological age.

The foregoing discussion has been based wholly upon 
the latest and most improved form of the Binet method— 
the Stanford revision, and upon what the writer knows to 
be the ideals in point-scale construction rather than the 
actual achievements as visible to those who know only the 
original or pre-adolescent Point Scale described in ‘‘A 
Point Scale for Measuring Mental Ability.” All earlier 
forms of the Binet method are neglected because their 
imperfections are more numerous and more serious than 
those of the Stanford Scale. It may therefore be assumed 
that such criticisms as are applicable to the latter apply 
with at least equal force to the former. On the other hand, 
it must be emphasized that the claims which I make for 
the point-scale system are not wholly justified by the present 
status of the method. I have ventured to draw the 
contrast sharply because of my belief that they will be 
justified by the results of work on the method which is 
now well advanced at the Psychopathic Hospital, Boston. 
In one respect the Stanford revision appears to be 
especially weak. It includes a number of tests (vocabu-
-P-A-G-E-165
ANALYSIS OF STANFORD-BINET SCALE 157 
lary, fables, arithmetical reasoning, and definitions, for 
example), which are highly dependent upon education. 
Were it not for this fact, which shortly becomes apparent 
to any experienced psychological examiner who attempts 
to use the method, Terman’s extension of the scale by the 
addition of tests for adolescents and adults would be a 
very great advantage. 
ANALYSIS OF THE STANFORD-BINET SCALE 
In connection with this comparison of the two systems 
of measurement, I have attempted to analyze the Stanford 
revision of the Binet Scale from the points of view of func- 
tions measured and the distribution of measurements 
among the various age groups. In all, ninety tests appear 
in the Stanford scale. Of these, seventy-four make up the 
twelve age groups, while sixteen stand as alternates. 
There are fifty-five different tests, that is, tests so obviously 
different in constitution and mode of response demanded 
that they may not be grouped as equivalents.. These 
may further be reduced to the following twenty-five 
functional groups on the basis of similarity of responses 
measured.

21, Visual imagination: clock test, Binet paper cutting, rhymes, absurdities. 
22, Fables.

25. Free association. 
Now it might be supposed, prior to examination, that 
some sort of test for a particular variety of response would 
appear in each age group, but this is not the case. Instead, 
the constructors of the scale seem to have systematically 
avoided not only repetition of a particular test, but even 
in the main, its repetition in increasingly difficult form. 
Thus, for example, the well-known Binet test of response 
to pictures by enumeration, description, or interpretation 
appears in the age groups three, seven, and twelve. It 
does not appear in any of the others nor is there any test 
which is strictly comparable with it in any one of the 
remaining nine groups of tests. The definition test which, 
if it has any practical value, might be supposed to be 
equally serviceable for all ages, is used for the ages five, 
eight, twelve and sixteen, and for those alone. Why for 
these particular ages instead of for any other or others 
between three years and intellectual maturity is difficult 
to imagine. Or again, the Stanford test, new to the Binet 
system, of repeating digits backward appears as an alter- 
nate for age seven and as a regular test for ages nine, 
twelve, sixteen and eighteen. Why, the critical psychol- 
ogist may well ask, is it not equally serviceable for the ages 
ten and fourteen? And why, if one chooses to carry this 
sort of question to its logical conclusion, should not the 
test be used for all ages from the early stages of linguistic 
development to intellectual maturity? 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
    ANALYSIS OF STANFORD-BINET SCALE 159 
As we follow through the list of fifty odd tests which 
make up this measuring scale, we observe that the number 
of groups in which a particular test appears tends to 
diminish. The infantile or childhood tests are many of 
them repeated in two, three, or even as many as five or 
six age-groups. But the tests of more complicated or 
more mature types of response tend, as the accompanying 
table shows, to be used in only a single group. The only 
striking exception to this rule is the vocabulary test, which 
finds place under the ages eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, 
sixteen, and eighteen years.

This analysis of the Stanford scale serves two purposes 
—first, it exhibits the haphazardness of distribution of a 
given test, the lack of any scientific principle, so far as the 
placing of a test in particular groups is concerned; and 
second, it indicates the entire absence of the functional 
principle in the selection of tests for a particular group. 
In view of these characteristics of the Stanford scale, it 
seems pertinent still further to emphasize the idea of 
gradation within a given test or measure of behavior. 
Assuming, as genetic studies certainly warrant us in doing, 
that the fundamental forms of behavior are present by the 
end of the third year in their initial stages, it seems logical 
and scientifically necessary to argue that we should devise 
methods of measuring these forms of behavior as they 
develop, and that the most natural and most feasible way
-P-A-G-E-169
ANALYSIS OF STANFORD-BINET SCALE 161 
to do this is to select a method which can be applied, accord- 
ing to a gradation scheme, to all stages of development. 
For example, the test of repeating digits may be increased 
in difficultness without end. It may be applied alike to 
the child of three and the intellectually mature individual. 
It may be graded almost perfectly by the addition of single 
digits. The initial form of the test may require merely 
the repetition of a digit after the examiner. The most 
difficult form may, instead, require the repetition of ten 
digits. Or, the test of response to pictures may be so 
devised and developed as to be clearly applicable from 
early childhood to maturity. It needs only a number of 
carefully selected pictures arranged according to difficult- 
ness of description and interpretation. The child of three 
years may be required merely to indicate certain objects 
in the pictures, as named by the examiner. The child of 
four may be required, instead, to name these same objects. 
Still later, more complete enumeration of the constituents 
of the pictures may be expected; then deseription, and 
interpretation increasingly full and exact with increasing 
age. Finally, there would be required, as an adequate 
form of response, correct interpretation and fair to excellent 
description. 
While it may not be assumed that precisely the same 
forms or aspects of behavior are measured by this test 
throughout its age range, it is at least evident that more 
nearly comparable results may be obtained by using the 
same materials for different ages than by using diverse 
and heterogeneous materials and procedures. 
Neither the Point Scale nor the Binet Scale is perfect or 
ever will be. But from their ashes may arise a new scale 
infinitely superior to anything Binet or any of his successors 
have imagined. I believe that the method of graded tests 
whose indices of correlation with one another and with 
varied measures of efficiency in living are definitely known, 
will steadily gain ground; that the gradation as gradually 
perfected will lead to increasingly accurate standardiza- 
tion; that there will accumulate reliable and varied norms 
ll

162 A POINT SCALE FOR MEASURING MENTAL ABILITY 
for the guidance of the inexperienced examiner; and that 
shortly our scales for mental measurement will consist of 
independently graded and standardized tests which can be 
used either alone for the measurement of particular response 
or in such groups as need dictates. 
The next step forward I imagine as a scale in which 
vertical instead of horizontal divisions will indicate age 
lines. It will consist of a score or two of thoroughly 
proved and approved methods of measurement, each so 
devised that it may be applied at any stage of development. 
Were there twelve steps or grades of difficultness in each 
test, then the examiner would begin with the first grade 
for the three-year-old; with the fifth grade for the eight- 
year-old; with the ninth grade for the twelve-year-old. 
Not the scale, but its constituent part, the test, would be 
marked for convenience of use by age lines. The lines 
consequently would be vertical instead of horizontal!

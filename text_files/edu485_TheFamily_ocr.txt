  PREFACE 
THE intention of this book is to bring together the 
materials for an estimate of the meaning and import- 
ance of the Family as an institution in human society. 
In order to understand its structure and influence as 
we now know it, and to judge whether it is an essential 
or merely temporary form of organisation, it seemed 
to be necessary to understand also something of its 
development and function in the past. Hence the 
first part consists of an attempt to explain some of 
the leading theories and facts of the history of the 
past, and to show their bearing upon the modern 
Family; while the second part is devoted to an 
analysis and description of this modern Family, and a 
consideration of its influence in social life. Itis quite 
remarkable how seldom the present student or reformer 
of society shows any recognition of the importance of 
the Family as compared with other and more artificial 
institutions. Indeed, the very word institution means 
in popular usage an asylum or a hospital or a re- 
formatory ; something with plenty of bricks and 
mortar and a large staff of officials. If we find a 
reference in a newspaper to some “excellent insti- 
tution,” it may prove to be an orphanage or a a LIBRARY IDDLE TENNESSEE STATE COLLEGE

soup-kitchen; it certainly will not be a Family. 
An institution which needs no subscription list 
for its support, no committee for its management, 
which is both self-contained and self-propagating, 
seems so independent of our conscious efforts that we 
are apt to forget how large a part of human life is 
devoted to its maintenance, and how large a part of 
* human life depends upon it for physical and moral 
existence. From time to time, it is true, statesmen 
and economists have recognised its deep significance 
for political and social movements; and I offer the 
book partly from this point of view, but partly also as 
a tribute to a most “ excellent institution.”

  INTRODUCTORY 
Waar is a Family, and what is its purpose? No one 
will feel himself at a loss in answering the question ; 
man, woman, and child, the “ practical syllogism,” 
two premisses and their conclusion, these in their 
combination form the Family, and the purpose of the 
combination is the mutual convenience and protection 
of all the members belonging to it. 
This is the Family as we know it and see it 
amongst us, without pausing to reflect upon it. 
Nevertheless in its past history, its present signifi- 
cance, and its importance for the future, it involves 
a whole heaven and earth beside. 
Even as we conceive it in this simplest form there 
is ambiguity and doubt involved. Must the union 
which constitutes a Family be permanent and exclu- 
sive in its nature, or may the individual members 
under given conditions break away and form fresh 
families with other individuals? It is a question 
which the law of the land decides one way, but which 
the Church would fain decide the other. Is the 
relation between parents and children one of mutual 
responsibility, or is it binding upon one side alone? 
There have been times when the rights of parents 
3
-P-A-G-E-10
4 THE FAMILY PART 
and the duties of children were almost exclusively 
; but to-day more would be found to 
er phasise the rights of children and duties of parents, 
N10 é relationship 0: r 
regponsibility between parents and children at all as 
obsglete. 
But apart from these ambiguities, in our simplest 
conception of the Family, we find it susceptible of the 
widest divergences of interpretation. In extent it 
has varied, and still varies, from signifying just one 
pair and their offspring to including all the genera- 
tions which have sprung from any one known or 
reputed ancestor. In practice almost any degree 
between these two extremes may be found as con- 
stituting the accepted Family. It is a matter of 
very differing custom, even in different parts of the 
same country, how nearly related a cousin must be 
in order to be accounted of the same Family ; while 
probably as individuals we should assume a different 
attitude according as his claim was to be entered on 
the pedigree, or admitted into the family circle. 
And how largely this question of the extent of the 
family relationship is one of human convention we 
learn still more emphatically from history, when we 
find that there have been times when only those 
descending through males were accounted of the 
Family, while yet again there have been other times 
when only those descending from the females were 
recognised. 
The purpose of the Family, as conceived by those
-P-A-G-E-11

I INTRODUCTORY 5 
  who_have reflected npon—it, has varied even more 
than its extent. Some find in it mainly ay, institu- 
tion for the care of the children, whose state of 
never been a time, when in_a greater or os degree, 
and more or_less_cons 
achieved this object.' Others, again, say that its 
original purpose was 8 for the pake of the parents and 
ces cul ved; and 
there have gee been rt periods of time 
amongst great peoples when this motive seems to 
have been the predominant one. Othgrs, again, main- 
tain_that it had its origin in private property and 
was_organised_for purposes of inheritance ; while 
others yet again find in it only a device 7 
the man is enabled to turn the labou 
child _to his own account. To some it is the ex- 
pression of a religion, indeed one of the most 
primitive and ultimate of all religions; to others a 
merely material phenomenon, explicable entirely on 
economic grounds. The origin of justice, the source 
of law, the fountain of. morality, the necessary 
prelude to the State, the most formidable rival to 
the State, a merely passing phase in the development 
of civilisation, an essential condition in all-stages of 
human progress; all these the Family has been held 
to be, and for nearly all views some justification may 
be found in past or present. 
It does not, of course, follow that these aspects 
1 T am aware that this proposition has been disputed, but see p. 36.
-P-A-G-E-12
    6 THE FAMILY PART 
and ovjects of the Family were consciously present 
in the minds of the individuals who found them- 
selves grouped in families. Many of the great pro- 
cesses of social life develop themselves through 
generations of unconscious instruments ; individuals, 
that is, who are of course keenly conscious of their own 
lives and purposes, but realise only partially, or not 
at all, how these form part in some far wider scheme. 
It is only when reflection comes, and when the 
advance of history and science enables man to take 
wider views backwards and forwards along the stream 
of human life, that he begins to be aware of the wider 
purposes which include his own, and to accept them 
consciously as his. 
Towards this widening of our outlook what fact 
can have contributed more potently than the fact of 
the Family itself in its binding together of the 
generations? It was interest in what our fathers 
have done in this world which gave the first impulse 
to history; it was wonder as to what they were 
doing after they were lost to this world which was 
the root of religious speculation; and it is the 
thought of our children’s lives which has always 
been the strongest link with the future which is so 
mysteriously hidden from ourselves. 
It is true that when we try to read the develop- 
ment of the Family in this way we find ourselves 
moving with much uncertainty and even bewilder- 
ment. We find ourselves driven to realise that the 
Family as we know it most intimately is only one
-P-A-G-E-13
  I INTRODUCTORY 7 
stage in a long process of change, and that to argue 
from its present constitution to what it has been in 
its past or will be in its future is full of danger. It 
is true, of course, that its present form is the outcome 
and contains the essential spirit of all that has gone 
before ; and equally true that if it has a future, if 
the present is not, as some say, a final stage of decay, 
then that future also must in germ be there. But in 
order to interpret the facts before us, we need much 
more material in the way of studied observation and 
history than is available. 
It is mainly in recent years that the Family as an 
institution has attracted the attention of the thinker 
and historian. It is so intimate a part of life, so 
inseparable from existence in all normal communities, 
that, like the air we breathe, it cludes observation, and la 
we only notice it when something goes wrong. And 
so 1 happens that far less is known about it than 
about analogous institutions such as states, and 
churches, and cities. But without some attempt to 
realise the past development, if only in its broader out- 
lines, it will be impossible to appreciate even the pre- 
sent significance of the Family in all its fulness. As we 
get glimpse after glimpse of first one aspect and then 
another predominating in the past, our conception of it 
gains in richness and completeness, and we first begin 
to realise the importance of the part it has played in 
the history of humanity. But so far much of our 
reading of the past is little more than a very tenta- 
tive construction out of materials which are hard to 
collect and still harder to interpret. There is a large 
 
-P-A-G-E-14

  and growing literature gathering round the subject, 
but it can hardly be said that there is as yet any 
generally accepted doctrine of the history of the 
Family. At best our investigators can point to the 
certainty that certain phases have existed in its 
development, and to the probability that these 
phases have succeeded each other in a certain order ; 
and on both points much difference of opinion exists. 
In the summary I shall attempt to give of the 
results so far attained, I shall mainly follow the line 
taken by Professor Howard in his admirable work on 
Matrimonial Institutions.
-P-A-G-E-15
  CHAPTER I 
THE PATRIARCHAL FAMILY 
THERE is one as of men who from time to time 
have taken a keen and practical interest in the 
constitution of the Family, and they are the States- 
men. They have realised how intimately the welfare 
of the State depends upon the influence and nature 
of the Families from which it is constituted; and 
they have endeavoured that the State in turn should, __ 
mould and influence the Family to its own 
Hence it comes about that the first and most obvious 
material which presented itself for the study of the 
Family was found in ancient law. Law of course 
did not make, any more than it can destroy, the 
Family ; but in law we have the systematic ex- 
position of those customs which the rulers of a 
people desire to perpetuate or enforce; and the 
code of laws of a people represents its recognised 
way of life as distinct from its caprices and aberra- 
tions. Great stress has been laid, especially in the 
earlier stages of inquiry, upon the information to 
be obtained about the organisation of the Family 
amongst the Greeks and Romans and Hindoos, 
from what remains to us of the laws of these 
9
-P-A-G-E-16
  10 THE FAMILY PART I 
peoples; and there is no doubt that we can con- 
struct from them a very vivid picture of what the 
Family was at certain stages of its development. 
But it would be a mistake to assume that these 
laws, however primitive themselves, necessarily re- 
cord primitive institutions. Laws are the outcome 
of a considerably advanced state of social develop- 
ment, and represent a society and institutions which 
may be far removed from their original simplicity. 
All that can fairly be said is, that the Family as 
represented in ancient law is the first of which we 
have documentary evidence; and the first therefore 
which we can realise to ourselves with definiteness 
and certainty. 
|. The particular form of the Family which early 
investigators, basing their inquiries upon ancient 
law, assumed to be original and primitive, is that 
known as the Patriarchal Family) and from it they 
lerived, not only later developments of the Family 
Va but also the organisation of the State, and the 
power of kings. - It is a form which it is easy for us 
to understand, because in its essential idea it is one 
with our own.4,That essential idea is, the supremacy 
of the Father in the Family ; and our modern insti- 
tution differs mainly from the typical patriarchal 
Family in the greater or less degree in which that 
power is limited./ The limitations are imposed partly 
by law and partly by custom; and differ very greatly 
between different peoples even of the present day. 
A man’s power may be absolute over his own 
Penton, but limited to one generation, or even to
-P-A-G-E-17
  CHAP. I THE PATRIARCHAL FAMILY 1 
the earlier years of that generation ; or, again, it may 
extend to his children’s children, and so to all 
descendants during his lifetime. Or, indeed, if we 
take into consideration the facts of ancestor-worship 
as still practised amongst some peoples, it is clear 
that to a large extent his power continues even 
after death over the generations of the living. We 
shall have occasion to consider these and other 
modifications in detail, further on; meanwhile we 
may note in passing some of the more important 
points in which the power of the father has gradually 
been limited im the development of the modem 
Family :-— 
1. The freedom of the sons to start independent —— 
households during the lifetime of the father. J 
2.The freedom of the children to acquire. in 
dependent property. 
3. The freedom of the children to order their own 
lives on attaining majority. 
4, The freedom of the children to marry as they 
choose. 
5. The right of children under age to protection 
from the State against the father. 
Tn one respect_only has the power of the father 
been increased, and that is in his relation to the 
Family property, and his greater freedom of bequest. 
(See Chapter xi.) 
The typical Patriarchal Family, which Sir Henry 
Maine and other writers have taken to represent in 
its structure the primitive form, is the Roman Family 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  12 THE FAMILY PART I 
in/ the days when the Patria Potestas, the power of 
[Ae father, was at its strongest. It consisted of the 
Head of the Family or Pater, and all descendants in 
the male line (including adopted sons and their 
descendants), and slaves. Over these his power was 
absolute... “the parent, when our information 
commences, has over his children the jus witae 
necisque, the power of life and death, and & 
fortiori of uncontrolled corporal chastisement; he 
can modify their personal condition at pleasure ; 
“he can give a wife to his son; he can give his 
daughter in marriage; he can divorce his children 
of either sex ; he can transfer them to another family 
by adoption, and he can sell them” (Maine, Ancient 
Law, p. 188). Even the eldest son who was to 
succeed to his authority had no rights apart from 
him so long as he lived; he was always in subjec- 
tion, and might not even start a separate home. 
Though married and himself the father of children 
he still remained a minor, subject to the complete 
egntrol of his father. 
\ Though the Patriarchal Family is large in the 
sense of including all living generations, it -is 
limited in the case before us by the fact that it 
included within its kinship only descendants through 
males. A woman when she married passed out of 
her original family into that of her husband and 
became subject to the power ruling therein; a fact 
represented to the present day by a woman’s 
assuming her husband’s name on marriage. But 
with us the change of name involves no change of
-P-A-G-E-19
  CHAP. I THE PATRIARCHAL FAMILY 13 
kinship ; and we distinguish carefully between blood 
relations and “connections by marriage.”* In the 
Roman family a woman’s children were not con- 
sidered to be related to her brother’s children. This 
particular system of relationship through males only, 
which is known as agnation, is not the essential 
feature of the Patriarchal Family, though found in 
connection with its most extreme form. It is parallel 
to the system of relationship through females only 
which we shall notice later on, and which again does 
not necessarily involve the rule of the mother, 
though it is sometimes found in connection with 
a matriarchate. 4 P 6 
rhe essential characteristic of the Petia} / 
Family is the permanent power of the Father ov 
~ the adult male members of his Family ; _and the 
source of this power, the reason which enabled him 
to maintain it, has given rise to much interesting 
speculation and research. It is easy to attribute 
the authority of the father over wife and child _—— 
to the superior strength of the man, so long 4s 
the children remain young and weak; but when 
we find the authority still attaching to a decrepit 
old man whose sons and grandsons are in the prime 
of life, and when his power over his wife continues 
to an advanced stage of civilisation after the sway 
of brute force has yielded to the supremacy of 
intellect and spirit, it is clear that some deeper 
foundation than that of physical strength is requisite, 
1 Cf. the old rhyme— 
“My son's my son till he gets him a wife, 
My daughter's my daughter all her life," 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
14 THE FAMILY i PART I 
Again it may be urged that as progenitor the 
Father is also possessor of his children, and that his 
power was derived from thé rights of a proprietor 
over his property. No doubt children were re- 
garded almost as property; but the same power 
extended over his wife and children by adoption, 
who could not be regarded as property for the 
same reason. Indeed, it has been pointed out that 
the Roman term Pater signified much more the 
lord or ruler than the father in our modern sense; 
    and that it might even happen that a man without 
children would be Head of the Family or Pater- 
familias, with unlimited authority over all members 
of it. In fact{ the one essential feature of the 
eae that he should not be within 
the Potestas of another man.* 
Another reason adduced for the authority of the 
Head of the Family is the superior wisdom and 
accumulated experience of the oldest member, who 
is thereby constituted the most capable of con- 
ducting its affairs and ruling its members. Probably 
this cause counted for much more in the days when 
wisdom and experience and even knowledge were 
literally matters of private property, which could 
only be passed on orally, as it were by private 
gift, from one generation to another. But as there 
gradually came to be a generalised stock of know- 
ledge, made common property by means of organised 
teaching and books, upon which every one could 
draw who chose, the importance of the old people 
1 Fustel de Coulanges: La Cité Antique, p. 97. 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  CHAP. I THE PATRIARCHAL FAMILY 15 
as the only source of wisdom would naturally tend 
to diminish. Le Play, writing in the first half of 
the nineteenth century, notes this as one reason 
why Russia was still peculiarly adapted to the 
patriarchal régime “. . . in a society where school 
education contributes nothing to the precocious 
development of the young, where knowledge is 
acquired only from actual living and from social 
relations, the old men have in fact an enormous 
superiority over the young people. These are 
conscious of their inferiority, and when in Russia 
one makes some inquiry from a man of forty he 
never fails to answer that such information can only 
be properly given by an older man.”* He notes 
instances of communities which have offered active 
resistance to the education of the young, solely on 
the ground that it would weaken the authority of 
the old. Even in England at the present day we 
are all familiar with the opponents of our systems 
of elementary education, who maintain that it is 
responsible for a growing disrespect amongst the 
children, and an increasing impatience of parental 
authority ; and it can hardly be denied that there is 
some truth in the criticism. 
But there is one kind of knowledge which never 
becomes public property, because there is not (except 
in very special cases) any public interest attaching to 
it. This is the knowledge of family history and 
tradition ; and just in proportion as family tradition 
is held to be of importance, the Head of the Family 
1 Les Ouvriers Ewropéens, vol. ii. p. 66. 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  16 THE FAMILY PART I 
retains the peculiar dignity which attaches to him 
as the main storehouse of tradition and personal 
recollection. Amongst people whose main or sole 
religion is ancestor-worship this dignity and authority 
are reinforced by the whole weight of religious sanc- 
tion, and it is to the fact of ancestor-worship that 
scholars now attribute the absolute power possessed 
by the Pater in the typical Patriarchal Family. He 
alone knew the traditional cult by which the de- 
parted ancestors were to be worshipped and appeased, 
and he alone could pass it on to his eldest son, and 
so ensure the continued prosperity of the Family. 
Thus any member of the Family who should cut 
himself loose from the authority of the Pater, not 
only debarred himself from the protection and favour 
of the ancestral gods during life, but condemned him- 
self to misery in the world of spirits, where he would 
be excluded from the family cult.’ 
There is such a deep significance in the fact that 
the worship of ancestors and of the domestic hearth 
preceded that of all other gods of the classical 
mythology, and that even after these had appeared 
upon the scene, the prayer to the hearth preceded 
that to any other divinity, that I will give here a 
brief account (taken from La Cité Antique) of the 
religion upon which the Patriarchal Family of the 
Aryans was founded. 
The basis of this religion was the belief in im- 
mortality. The spirits of the dead lived again, a 
1 Compare the modern superstition that the souls of unchristened 
children can find no resting place after death.
-P-A-G-E-23
CHAP. I THE PATRIARCHAL FAMILY LY 
shadowy life beneath the earth, whence they exercised 
power for good or for evil upon the fortunes of those 
who continued to represent the Family upon the 
earth. And upon the living members of the Family, 
strictly speaking upon the Head of the Family, they 
depended not only for actual food and drink, but 
also for the cult which ensured their blessedness. 
They were gods indeed, but only so long as the 
worship due to gods was offered them ; failing that, 
they left their burial place and became wandering 
spirits to torment the living. 
This worship, so essential to living and to dead, 
could be offered only by the direct descendants of 
the dead, because they alone knew the necessary 
ritual, Every family had its ow culiar cult, to 
which no stranger was ever adniftted, and which 
alone could appease and satisfy the gods of that 
family. The cult was handed from father to son, 
from generation to generation, and could not be 
lost without condemning the whole series of ancestors 
to eternal misery. Hence it became a matter of 
sacred duty to ensure the continuance of the family. 
Celibacy was “both an impiety and a misfortune” ; 
involving a “kind of damnation,” both for the 
offender and his ancestors. At Athens the law 
charged the first magistrate of the city with the 
duty of watching lest any family should be in 
danger of extinction; and it was the custom in 
Greece, when the citizens were called out to war, 
to assign the posts of danger to married men who 
already had sons to carry on the family. “Une 
0
-P-A-G-E-24
18 THE FAMILY PART I 
famille qui s’éteint, c’est un culte qui meurt.” For 
those who remained childless (that is without sons, 
since daughters were useless in this respect) the 
expedient remained of adoption, whereby a stranger 
was solemnly initiated into the religion of the Family. 
By this he was constituted in its most important 
sense the son of the Family, and the heir to its 
responsibilities. So closely indeed is the idea of 
the Family connected with that of the ancestral 
worship, that classical authors are found to maintain 
that relationship actually consists in sharing the 
same cult. It was for this reason that kinship was 
counted in the male line alone amongst the Romans ; 
no person could partake in two cults, a woman when 
she married abandoned the cult of her own family 
and entered into that of her husband, hence she 
and her children ceased to be related to the family 
from which she sprang. Hence also, in all proba- * 
bility, the comparatively slight estimation in which, 
even to this day, the daughters of a family are apt 
to be held. 
This family worship (long forgotten precursor of 
[bur modern family prayers) was always offered to 
the ancestors at the domestic hearth, which was at 
once the centre of the home life and the sacred place 
of religion. VRound the hearth all members of the 
Family assembled for the rites of worship, and 
nothing alien nor unclean was admitted into the 
sacred precinct. 
This sacredness of the hearth, and the necessity of 
preserving its purity, became also the source of
-P-A-G-E-25
  CHAP. I THE PATRIARCHAL FAMILY 19 
morality. It demanded from all who approached it 
chastity, purity from blood-guiltiness, faithfulness in 
married life. Those who offended against its laws 
must expiate the offence before being readmitted to 
its service. In our expression “filial piety” we still 
preserve a record of the time when religion and the 
due observance of family morality were one thing, 
when piety consisted in the exercise of the domestic 
virtues. ‘‘ All was divine within the family” ; love 
of home was a virtue, because in the home alone 
man found his God, and he loved his house as to-day 
he loves his church. 
The Hindoo prayer to the hearth is beautifully 
expressive of this aspect of the Family as the strength 
and preserver of righteous living: ‘Thou restorest 
to the right way the man who has gone astray in the 
wrong. . .. If we have committed a fault, if we 
have walked far from thee, pardon us.” It is an 
expression for all time of the influence of family 
life at its best and highest. 
Thus it came about that the Head of the Patri- 
archal Family was much more than the mere father 
of its younger members. He was high priest of the 
family religion; upon his strict fulfilment of his 
function depended the welfare not only of the 
generations to come, but also of all the generations 
past, and it is probable that the latter was held to be 
by far the more important. To serve the Family, to 
preserve its traditions, to protect its purity, this was 
the whole duty of man, at once his religion and 
morality; and it was this which invested with
-P-A-G-E-26
  20 THE FAMILY PART I 
absolute authority that member of the Family who 
for the time being represented it and was responsible 
for its welfare. 
It is interesting to pause here and consider how 
much we have inherited from our Aryan ancestors of 
this intense feeling about the Family. No one, I 
think, will seriously question that we still possess a 
deep and instinctive feeling of its sanctity, which may 
be due to the pre-eminent position which it once 
occupied in the religion of our race, or which again 
may be simply accounted for by the fact that we are 
of the same nature as our ancestors. It is still the 
guardian of morality, and there are few who do not 
still consider it their first duty to guard the purity 
of domestic life, and who would not condemn a 
violation of the sanctity of the Family even more 
strongly than the violation of religious observances. 
So far it may be said that the religion of the hearth 
continues to hold the first place in man’s spirit ; but 
with this great difference, that the weight of feeling 
is now thrown forward into the future rather than 
back into the past. If asked as to the meaning of 
the Family at the present day, our first impulse 
would be to say that its chief raison détre, the 
duties and responsibilities which hold it together, are 
no longer the cult of its ancestors, but the nurture of 
the young. The modern father ministers to the 
needs not of the vanishing but of the coming genera- 
tion, he worships the rising and not the setting sun; 
and it is one of the strange paradoxes which the 
spiritual world is always offering to us that this  
-P-A-G-E-27
CHAP, I THE PATRIARCHAL FAMILY 21 
change should have brought with it, for good or for 
evil, so great a diminution of his personal authority. 
Even celibacy, if not altogether condoned, would now 
be deplored less for the sake of the dead than for the 
sake of the unborn, either the coming generation 
who must lack the comrades they should have had, 
or the souls which are denied existence in mortal 
life. 
But though ancestor-worship has ceased amongst 
us as a conscious cult, it would be folly to imagine 
that the Family has shaken off the sway of its 
departed members, or that its fortunes are not 
largely ruled by them. Family pride, which at its 
best does so much to strengthen the young, largely 
consists in the desire to do nothing unworthy of 
those who have preceded us; and unwillingness to 
depart from the ways of our ancestors, even when 
altered conditions would make such departure 
“yveasonable,” is responsible for perhaps the greater 
part of conservatism. But even more powerful in 
its sway over us than our reluctance to depart from 
the ways of our ancestors, is our frequent inability 
to do so. The family spirit which was in them, 
moulding not only their ways of thought and speech 
and action but even their expression and features, is 
also in us, moulding our lives at every turn, and 
claiming us as inexorably as in the days when our 
forefathers gathered round the family altar. It is 
a common form of speech to say of this or that 
tendency or habit or capacity, more especially 
perhaps if we feel deprecatory about it, that we

22 THE FAMILY PART I 
“ get it from” a parent-or grandparent; and all the 
rest we are apt to regard as peculiarly our own. But 
if we could know as intimately as we know our 
more immediate parents the long line of ancestors 
through whom the family spirit has passed on its 
way to us, we should probably become fatalists in 
face of the apparently overwhelming evidence that 
there is nothing in us that has not come to us from, 
or at least through, the Family. Family portrait 
galleries are a striking confirmation of the persist- 
ence of characteristics which ultimately govern the 
fortunes of successive generations. 
“lb 
To realise the nature and influence of ancestor- 
worship upon family life we need not have recourse 
only to bygone times. Our increased knowledge of 
the East enables us to study it as actually moulding 
the lives of people at the present day. In Japan 
and the Japanese, a Japanese professor writes (p. 
281), “ Worship of ancestors still obtains, and exer- 
cises a powerful influence over the laws and customs 
of the people. ... . Buddhism, which is not based on 
‘this doctrine, but antagonistic to it, was compelled 
to yield to the deep-rooted belief of the people, and 
adapt itself to the national practice; while the 
introduction of Western civilisation has had no 
influence whatever in modifying the custom.” By 
some writers stress has been laid on the dread felt 
for the spirits of the departed, and the desire to 
appease them, but this motive for the cult does not 
seem to be recognised in Japan. ‘‘ We celebrate the
-P-A-G-E-29
  
  CHAP, I THE PATRIARCHAL FAMILY 23 
anniversary of our ancestors, pay visits to their 
graves, offer flowers, food, drink, burn incense, and 
bow before their tombs, entirely from a feeling 
of love and a respect for their memory, and no 
question of ‘dread’ enters our mind in doing so. 
Moreover, in the records and traditions of our 
country there is nothing that suggests that ancestors 
were worshipped with a view of propitiating their 
souls.” 
“ Ancestor-worship was the primeval religion of 
Japan from the earliest times of our history, which 
dates back more than 2500 years, and it is uni- 
versally practised by the people at the present 
moment.” 
Marriage as an institution is recognised by the 
Japanese State as the means of perpetuating the 
worship of ancestors, whose posthumous happiness 
depends upon it. In the eyes of the old law it 
was essential that a family should perpetuate itself 
for ever; and it was accounted the greatest = 
fortune as well as the greatest crime to die withou 
male issue. But amongst the Samurai it was 
formerly only the eldest sons who could legally 
marry; it was unnecessary for the younger sons, 
who had no apparent hope of ever becoming the 
head of a household, and who were therefore known 
as “heyazumi” or “ dwellers in apartments.” 
Though Western civilisation has been without 
effect upon the religion of ancestor- worship in 
Japan, it appears to be considerably modifying the
-P-A-G-E-30
  24 THE FAMILY PART I 
autocracy of the Head of the House... “until 
recently a house was a corporation and a legal unit of 
the State. But ever since the Restoration of 1868 the 
family system has gradually fallen, until at present 
the house has entirely lost its corporate character. 
Formerly it was the head of the family only who 
could fill an official position, serve in the army, and 
hold property. But with the reform in the system 
of government the members of a house were per- 
mitted to fill public positions, and with the reforms 
of the law of military conscription both head and 
members are liable to military duties; while with 
the progress of commerce and industry the younger 
members were entitled to hold public bonds, stocks 
and share, which the law now recognises as their 
separate property. Although the house has thus 
lost its corporate character in the eyes of the law, it 
still, nevertheless, retains its character as the unit of 
society. The new Civil Code, which came into 
operation in 1898, allows members to secede from a 
household, and to establish a new ‘branch house’ 
with the consent of the head of the family ; for the 
law recognises the tendency of social progress towards 
individualism, but at the same time it makes careful 
provision for the continuity of the house. It is pro- 
vided in Article 744 that ‘the legal presumptive heir 
is not permitted to enter another house, or to estab- 
lish a new one, except in cases where the necessity 
arises for the succession to maintain the main branch 
of the house.” <A legal presumptive heir is heres 
necessarius, as to him falls the duty of succeeding  
-P-A-G-E-31
  CHAP. I THE PATRIARCHAL FAMILY 25 
to the headship of his house, and of upholding the 
continuity of its worship. For that reason he or 
she cannot become a member of another house by 
marriage, adoption, or any other cause; nor found a 
house of his or her own except where the more 
important duty of preserving the continuity of the 
worship of the main branch of the house renders such 
a step necessary.” 
The practice of ancestor-worship in Japan, and its 
influence upon the organisation of the Family, is 
strikingly analogous to that of our Aryan ancestors 
as described to us by the scholars, even down to the 
expedient of adoption upon failure of male issue. 
But it seems likely that in time to come the develop- 
ment will take a different line. Amongst our own 
ancestors the patriarchal organisation of the Family, 
and the power of the Head, persisted after the 
religion which gave rise to it had given way to new 
beliefs. In Japan, as we see, the religion persists 
untouched, although, the patriarchal organisation is 
falling away before the advance of modern ideas, and 
modern forms of industry. Both those who believe 
that the unity of the Family is based upon economic 
causes, and that with the economic independence of 
its members it is bound to fall to pieces; and those, 
on the other hand, who believe that its greatest 
strength is rooted in more spiritual causes, must 
watch the coming development of the Family in 
Japan with the keenest interest. Not only do 
changes proceed with wonderful rapidity when 
once initiated amongst that wonderful people, 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  26 THE FAMILY PART I 
but the disintegrating forces of economic individ- 
ualism will have to contend amongst them with 
the spiritual forces of ancestor-worship in its most 
complete form; not as the mere tradition and 
instinct which has survived amongst the Western 
peoples.
-P-A-G-E-33
  CHAPTER II 
THE PRE-HISTORIC FAMILY 
Ir now we ask what, if any, form of the Family pre- 
ceded the Patriarchal, we find ourselves directed to 
sources of information, or perhaps one should say 
rather of conjecture, which are full of difficulty, an d 
which can at best lead only to a tentative construc- 
tion. The most important of these sources consists 
in the observation of existing races who are in what 
is believed to be a very early stage of development. 
Here, it is thought, we have under our very eyes a 
people still in a stage which we ourselves have passed 
through in the infancy of our race; let us study the 
position and constitution of the Family amongst 
them, and then we shall be able to realise what it has 
been amongst all primitive races, ourselves included, 
when first starting on the upward march. And if 
it were clear, in the first place, that these people really Lae 
were in an early stage, and were not “degenerates ” 
and, in the second place, that all races of men must pass 
through the same stages of development, and manifest 
the same social phenomena and institutions, then the 
argument would carry great weight. But it seems clear, 
on the contrary, that so far as our present knowledge 
goes this is far from being the case; that there are 
27
-P-A-G-E-34
a 
  28 THE FAMILY PART I 
certain races of men whoseem to be incapable of develop- 
ing a high state of social life; and that to argue from 
the customsof the aborigines of Australia to those of our 
Aryan ancestors may be to rely upon a very misleading 
analogy. It might well be that their defective organi- 
sation of the Family was itself one of the chief causes 
which made their social development impossible. 
To this difficulty of getting a true analogy to work 
from must be added the difficulty of observing rightly, 
and of rightly interpreting what is observed. It has 
been well remarked that the modern novel of “slum 
life” really tells us very little about the lives of the 
people it attempts to portray; it only tells of the 
impression made upon the writer, which may be, and 
generally is, a very different matter. And if this is 
the case with people of our own race and nationality, 
how much more with people of wholly different race 
and traditions. Students of the subject are wholly 
‘dependent for their material upon the reports fur- 
ished by men who have travelled or lived amongst 
the people whose customs are being studied, and these 
reports are apt to conflict in a most perplexing 
manner. To take one instance only, the now famous 
theory of “ group-marriage,” which has formed a 
striking feature in the history of the Family.’ The 
theory was largely based upon the evidence of 
the English missionary Lorimer Fison concerning 
a tribe of aborigines in South Australia. He de- 
scribes this tribe as being divided into two classes; 
and every man in each of these classes as being by 
1 Engels, Der Ursprung der Familie, ch. ii.
-P-A-G-E-35
  CHAP. II THE PRE-HISTORIC FAMILY 29 
birth the rightful husband of every woman in the other 
class, while similarly every woman in each class is the 
rightful wife of every man in the other. This descrip- 
tion has been constructed as evidence of a time when 
the relation between the men and women of the two 
classes was one of promiscuity, and when therefore 
there was, strictly speaking, no family at all. 
But if now we turn to later writers, we find them 
citing the Australian aborigine on the other side, i.e. 
against the theory of group-marriage, and in support 
of the view that the Family is to be found in the 
very lowest stages of social life. Grosse, for example 
quotes another witness of their customs (Curr) 
as saying that amongst the Australians not only is 
there no evidence of community of wives, but the 
husband is absolute and sole proprietor of his wife or 
wives ;’ while Professor Howard, in summing up the 
discussion, considers that “it is by no means estab- 
lished that communal or even group- marriage has 
ever prevailed amongst the Australian aborigines.” ? 
It seems possible that the real relation between the 
two groups noticed by Fison is simply that members 
of one class may not marry amongst themselves, but 
only amongst members of the other class—a very differ- 
ent matter from freedom to marry all members of the 
other.* Whatever the facts may be, it is clear that on 
one side or the other there must have been misunder- 
standing or misinterpretation, and clear, moreover, that 
such misinterpretation is very difficult to avoid.

30 THE FAMILY PART I 
  In addition to this observation of backward races 
of the present day, we have descriptions handed down ' 
to us by writers of the past; and in so far as these 
are descriptions of peoples who have subsequently 
developed into civilisation, they yield material which 
is far more relevant to the purpose. When Tacitus 
tells us of the customs of the Germans, or Cesar of 
the customs of the Britons, there is no question of 
doubtful analogy ; they actually are our own institu- 
tions in an early stage of development which are 
being described. On the other hand, the liability to 
misinterpretation is increased ; not only may we doubt 
a Roman’s power of fully comprehending what he 
sees or hears of a wild people whose very language 
he may not understand, there is also our own difficulty 
in interpreting his somewhat meagre generalisations 
to be taken into account. We cannot cross-question 
our informant; we cannot ask him whether this or 
that interpretation of what he tells us is the correct 
one; and we -annot get from him further details 
which he thought too insignificant to record, but 
which might be decisive for our purpose. 
Finally, there is the difficulty that an observer of 
strange peoples is liable to confuse what is abnormal 
or accidental with what is really characteristic ; he is 
naturally struck by phenomena which are startling 
and novel to himself, and many easily mistake an 
aberration for a custom. There are few of the strange 
“customs” quoted by investigators of this subject 
which might not be found to occur in the darker 
regions of any great modern city ; but no one would
-P-A-G-E-37
/ 
  CHAP. II THE PRE-HISTORIO FAMILY 31 
cite them as customary and typical of our social 
institutions merely because they exist amongst us. 
Materials drawn from the observation of primitive 
races are thus subject to grave difficulties; they may 
sometimes, however, find corroboration from another 
source, and that is the survival in the present day, or 
in trustworthy records, of customs which appear to be 
relics of them. Thus, for instance, the supporters of the 
“marriage by capture” theory find a double confirmation 
of it when they hear of existing tribes amongst whom 
(it is thought) capture is the normal method of obtain- 
ing a wife, and can also point to the fact that marriage 
customs exist amongst all Aryan peoples, which seem 
to be explicable as symbolising a forcible capture of 
the bride. 
Such, then, are the main sources upon which we 
have to draw when we try to read the history of the 
Family before the time when it was recorded in 
ancient law. For a complete examination of the suc- 
cessive theories which have been put forward, and of 
the material out of which they have been constructed, 
I refer the reader to Professor Howard’s History of 
Matrimonal Institutions, which contains also a very 
full bibliography. Here it is sufficient for my pur- 
pose to note the different views which have succeeded 
each other, and the conclusions which seem to, hold 
the field at the present moment. 
The first important contention ‘against the theory 
that the Patriarchal Family represents the original 
form was advanced by the well-known Swiss writer
-P-A-G-E-38
  32 THE FAMILY PART I 
Bachofen, whose book on Mutterrecht appeared in 
1861. “The material is drawn mainly from two 
sources : the fragmentary notices of the rules of kin- 
ship and the matrimonial customs of various peoples 
handed down from various writers, supplemented 
slightly through similar accounts by modern travellers; 
and an interpretation of the supposed symbolism or 
religious myths, particularly those of the Greeks.” + 
Working from this material, Bachofen contends that 
so far from the original Family being patriarchal in 
its structure, it was strictly matriarchal. In the 
beginning was chaos. The first element of order was 
introduced into this chaos by woman, wearying of 
the reign of lawlessness and imposing her rule upon 
men. This she did by means of the mysteries of 
religion, and thus the Matriarchal Family was insti- 
tuted in which the women were leaders and rulers. 
This continued until the woman grew too haughty to 
wed, when man rebelled and reasserted his superior 
power, and the Patriarchal Family was instituted. 
Each of these moments represents, according to Bach- 
ofen, a “ universal culture-stage,” through which all 
peoples pass in the development of their social life. 
Since this theory was first published much has 
been written, both in confirmation and in criticism of 
it. The two main points towards which controversy 
has been directed are (1) whether the organisation of 
society into families was ever really preceded by a 
period in which such organisation was entirely absent; 
and (2) to what extent the position of women in the 
1 Howard, p. 89. 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
CHAP. II THE PRE-HISTORIC FAMILY 33 
earlier type of Family was really analogous to that 
of the man in the Patriarchal Family. 
If we take the latter point first, we find that a 
certain school of writers has been extraordinarily 
enthusiastic in support of the theory of a Golden 
Age for women, when there was not only a matriar- 
chate, but even a gynzcocracy ; when women, that 
is, ruled not only in the Family but also amongst 
the people. Friedrich Engels, for instance, main- 
tains’ that even now amongst peoples at a very 
early stage of development women hold a far higher 
position than in our present civilisation. But later 
and more cautious writers find little reason to suppose 
that there has been any general stage in human 
development where woman’s position has been that 
of supremacy ; while all the actual evidence, as dis- 
tinct from mere inference, points to the fact that 
amongst peoples in an early stage of development, 
the position of women generally approaches very near 
to slavery. 
But the reason which led to the hypothesis of a 
matriarchal Family is one of great interest. It is 
the discovery that amongst certain peoples, possibly 
amongst all at a certain stage of development, re- 
lationship is counted only through the mother, the 
children taking their name from the mother and not 
from the father. It is perhaps not unnatural that, 
with the analogy of the Roman Family before their 
minds, the earlier students should have assumed over- 
hastily that this system of maternal kinship carried 
1 Engels, Der Ursprung der Familie, p. 82. 
D
-P-A-G-E-40
34 THE FAMILY PART I 
with it a system of maternal supremacy in the 
Family; that they should further have assumed a 
female supremacy in the clan is perhaps less excusable. 
It is true that a few tribes are known, notably the 
Hurons and Iroquois of North America, amongst 
whom women appear to guide and rule to a very 
remarkable degree; but such instances “belong to 
the rarest curiosities of ethnology” (Grosse, p. 161), 
and even in these exceptional cases accounts differ 
very much as to the actual extent of the women’s 
power. Lafitau, as quoted by Grosse, speaks of them 
as possessing all real authority, as well as the land 
and its produce, while they are masters of peace and 
war, guardians of the public treasure, and rulers 
over their children. On the other hand, Schoolcraft 
(quoted by Westermarck, p. 500) represents the posi- 
tion in a much milder light: the Iroquois are “the 
only tribes in America, north and south, so far as we 
have any accounts, who gave to women a conservative 
power in their political deliberations. The Iroquois 
matrons had their representative in the public councils ; 
and they exercised a negative, or what we call a veto 
power, in the important question of the declaration 
of war. They had the right also to interpose in bring- 
ing about a peace.” Moreover, adds Westermarck, 
they had considerable privileges in the Family. 
With a few exceptions like these, the rule appears 
to be that the man is undisputed master over both 
wife and children, no matter whether the latter are 
pe by his name or the mother’s; and still more 
certainly is he the ruler in the tribe. In so far as  
-P-A-G-E-41
CHAP. II THE PRE-HISTORIC FAMILY 35 
the authority within the Family rests with the father, 
the Patriarchal Family may be said to co-exist with 
a system of kinship through the mother, and at the 
earliest stages of development. But it is, generally 
speaking, a power based merely upon the superior 
physical strength of the man, and therefore incapable 
of organising the Patriarchal Family in its fullest 
sense. What it does do is to preclude the possibility 
of a really matriarchal Family, and we are forced, 
however reluctantly, to abandon the vision of Woman’s 
Golden Age. Amongst the peoples of the earliest type 
we know—the “lower hunters”—her lot is worst of 
all: “the woman has as yet nothing to set against 
the natural physical superiority of hunter and warrior ; 
hence she becomes of necessity a slave without rights, 
the obedient servant of the desires and laziness of her 
lord and husband” (Grosse). Her emancipation comes 
but slowly with the development of the race, depend- 
ing, as some hold, upon the increasing value of her 
services, and her increasing capacity for economic inde- 
pendence, or, as others maintain, upon the influence 
of religion and culture. But at the lowest level, her 
best or only chance of considerate treatment from her 
husband lies in having powerful relations to whom 
she can appeal for protection against him. 
There seems to be, then, no sufficient ground for 
the theory that the patriarchial was preceded by a 
matriarchal Family. So far as we can see, what really 
preceded it was a less highly organised form of the 
patriarchal Family, sometimes, but not always, co-exist- 
ing with a system of relationship through the mothers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
36 THE FAMILY PART I 
If now we turn to the first of the stages assumed by 
Bachofen, that of chaos without any organised family 
life, we find that it has been subjected to criticism 
quite as destructive. This theory of an original 
promiscuity amongst primitive peoples involves 
an entire absence of Family life, the children belong- 
ing to the tribe in general, and being protected by 
all the men indiscriminately ;* and when first promul- 
gated it was accepted unreservedly by the sociologists 
(e.g. by H. Spencer in his Principles of Sociology). 
For confirmation of it they pointed not only to insti- 
tutions and customs which they maintained to be 
inexplicable except as relics of such a state, but also 
to a number of apparent proofs that even in the pre- 
sent day the lowest peoples live in this condition. 
But closer investigation of the evidence has shown 
that “there is absolutely not one single primitive 
people” whose condition approximates to, or even 
indicates, such a system, or want of system. “This 
firmly-welded single Family is in no sense a late 
attainment of civilisation, but it exists even at the 
lowest stage of culture, as a rule, without exception.” ” 
And with regard to the customs which are thought 
to be relics of such a time, partly they seem to be 
capable of other interpretations, and partly there 
is no doubt that abnormal deviations from morality 
have been mistaken for normal customs. They have 
been subjected to detailed criticism by Westermarck, 
and his conclusion is that “there is not a shred of 
genuine evidence for the notion that promiscuity ever 
1 Westermarck, p. 41. 2 Grosse, p. 42.
-P-A-G-E-43
CHAP. I THE PRE-HISTORIC FAMILY 37 
formed a general stage in the social history of man- 
kind. The hypothesis of promiscuity, instead of 
belonging, as Professor Giraud-Teulon thinks, to 
the class of hypotheses which are scientifically per- 
missible, has no real foundation, and is essentially 
unscientific.” * 
As far back, then, as we can penetrate into the 
early history of the human race we find the Family 
already existing, and we find the father as the pro- 
tector and master of the Family. This is not equiva- 
lent to saying that it has been so from the first; the * 
real beginnings of human life seem to be impenetrably 
shrouded from sight. But Westermarck suggests still 
another way of approaching the subject, and that is 
’ through the customs of those members of the animal 
world which are most nearly akin to the human race. 
From the gregariousness of many animals it has been 
customary to argue to an analogous gregariousness of 
the human race, and to maintain that it is only at a 
later stage that the Family develops within the tribe ; 
but Westermarck points out that this gregariousness 
exists only very partially amongst just those animals 
which are nearest in other respects to man. The 
orang-utan, the gorilla, and the chimpanzee, all live 
in pairs with their young; assembling in numbers at 
times, more especially when food is plentiful, but for 
the most part wandering in solitary families. “Is it 
not, then, most probable that our fruit-eating human 
or half-human ancestors, living on the saroe kind of 
1 Westermarck, p. 133. 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
38 THE FAMILY PART I 
food, and requiring about the same quantities of it as 
the man-like apes, were not more gregarious than 
they? It is likely, too, that subsequently, when man 
became partly carnivorous, he continued, as a rule, 
this solitary kind of life, or that gregariousness 
became his habit only in part. ‘An animal of a 
predatory kind,’ says Mr. Spencer, ‘which has prey 
that can be caught and killed without help, profits by 
living alone ; especially if its prey is much scattered, 
and is secured by stealthy approach, or by lying in 
ambush. Gregariousness would here be a positive 
disadvantage. Hence the tendency of large carni- 
vores, and also of small carnivores that have feeble 
and widely-distributed prey, to lead solitary lives.’ 
It is, indeed, very remarkable that even now there 
are savage peoples who live rather in separate families 
than in tribes, and that most of these peoples belong 
to the very rudest races in the world.” * 
It is, of course, a far cry from this primitive, self- 
governing family group, based upon the elementary 
passions of possession, jealousy, and parental affec- 
tion, to the highly organised group of to-day, bound 
together by mutual contract, supported and limited 
by its existence within the more powerful institution 
of the State, recognised as a matter of public as well 
as private interest, and with an age-long history 
behind it of modifications and confirmations. Though 
itself the first and most permanent of all human in- 
stitutions, it was inevitable that the growth of other 
1 Westermarck. p, 43,  
-P-A-G-E-45
  
  CHAP. II THE PRE-HISTORIC FAMILY 39 
institutions should greatly affect and modify it; and 
of these the most potent in their influence have been 
Religion, the State,and the organised accumulation 
of wealth and private property. It has been greatly 
affected, again, by the varying economic conditions 
under which people have lived, and by their relations 
as conquerors or conquered to other peoples. One 
of the earliest ways which man devised of expressing 
his superior wealth or strength was to appropriate, by 
means of purchase or conquest, more wives than his 
neighbours. But throughout all changes one husband 
and one wife has been the constant type, all other 
forms mere aberrations, and the process of develop- 
ment has been always towards a more deliberately 
conscious and therefore higher form of monogamy.’ 
And throughout all changes, again, the characteristic 
feature has persisted that father, mother, and children 
have formed one group, of which the father has been 
the head in the sense not only of being the master, 
but alse ef being cape fer its pretectien and 
maintenance. 
One of the arguments which has been brought 
forward in support of an extreme form of Communism 
and State Socialism is, that the Family has been 
merely the temporary product of a particular stage 
of economic development, and that with the sweeping 
away of capitalism and private property the Family 
_also will disappear. Then the children will be cared 
for by society as a whole, and men and women will 
1 Howard, p. 150.    
-P-A-G-E-46
  40 THE FAMILY PART I 
be free to enter into or abandon married life as their 
fancy may dictate.’ If such a time should ever come, 
it will be in no sense a gradual development from the 
past, there is no justification for it in the history of 
the human race, and it will be as catastrophic in the 
moral world as an earthquake is in the physical. 
There seem few limits indeed to the deviations’ to 
which humanity is liable in its upward progress ; but 
it would seem as if the one essential characteristic, 
which no force of circumstances has ever been able to 
destroy, or even to subdue for more than a short 
time and amongst degenerate specimens, is the peculiar 
and unique feeling of parent for child. It may show 
itself in many ways, it may be kind or cruel, wise or 
foolish, it may involve infinite self-sacrifice or infinite 
tyranny, it may be called instinct, or possession, or 
love, or responsibility, but always it has maintained 
itself against all other claims, and in so maintaining 
itself has created the Family. Parents, indeed, have 
sacrificed their children to their gods or to the State, 
but, always it has been recognised as a gift, and a gift 
Ain highest order, which they alone had the right 
to make. And if it should ever come to pass that 
men and women will be content to abandon their 
children to the community merely for the sake of 
their own greater ease, it will mean such a breaking 
up of the whole moral nature of the race that not the 
Family alone, but the State itself will be shattered 
in its foundations.

CHAPTER III 
THE FAMILY IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 
THERE is a German saying in which German socio- 
logists like to sum up one theory of human develop- 
ment, the saying “ wenn man weiss, was ein Volk isst, 
so weiss man auch, was es ist.” It owes much of its 
attractiveness to a play upon words which does not 
survive translation into English (when we know what 
a people eats, we know also what it is), but it embodies 
a truth which must not be lost sight of in considering 
human affairs. There is no tendency to neglect it at 
the present day ; everywhere we hear the cry of the 
majority that food, and more food, and still more 
food, is the one thing needful for social salvation, 
while a sturdy and growing minority proclaim their 
faith that to eat less food is the sovereign panacea for 
all the ills of the individual. And meanwhile the 
number of those who have given in their adhesion to 
some particular form of diet as that which will conduce 
to. the highest life increases every day. There is a 
humorous account in one of Miss Wilkins’ New 
England stories of a bad-tempered man who tried to 
cure his fault by changing his diet, and he puts the 
case for the materialist view of life perhaps as shrewdly 
41 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  42 THE FAMILY PARTI 
as it ever has been put. ‘“ What we want,” he says, 
“is to eat the kind of things that will strengthen 
knowledge an’ spirit an’ self-control, because the first 
two ain’t any account without the last; but there 
ain’t no kind of food that’s known that can do that. 
If there is, I ain’t never heard of it. But what we 
can do, is to eat the kind of things that won’t 
strengthen the animal nature at the expense of the 
spiritual. We know that animal food does that; we 
can see how it works in tigers and bears. Now, it’s 
the spiritual part of us we want to strengthen, because 
that’s the biggest strength we can get, an’ it’s worth 
more. It’s what gives us the rule over other animals. 
It’s better for us to eat some other kind of food, if we 
get real weak and pindlin’ on it, rather than eat 
animal food an’ make the animal in us stronger than 
the spiritual, so we won’t be any better than wild 
tigers an’ bears, an’ lose our rule over the other 
animals” (Pembroke, p. 51). 
There is nothing older since man first began to 
think about himself, that greatest of human puzzles, 
than his belief that he can change his moral nature 
by what he eats. We hear of savages who will eat 
the heart of a brave enemy in the confident belief 
that in so doing he adds the valour of the dead man 
to his own; and we are told that sacramental meals 
are rooted in the same faith. But to the savage it 
probably never occurs to reflect, while the educated 
man finds it easy to forget, that for a man to deliber- 
ately change or regulate his diet with a view to the 
cultivation of certain qualities, implies that the know-  
-P-A-G-E-49
coar.1r IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 43 
ledge and desire of those qualities is already active in 
him, and that the material food is but the instrument 
or means by which the active spiritual principle seeks 
to strengthen itself. He is determined to be brave, 
or holy, or meek, and more or less ignorantly controls 
his economic conditions to advance his desire. 
It is much the same with the attempt to explain 
the development of humanity, or of any human 
institution, entirely by the economic conditions within 
which it develops. Just in proportion as man raises 
himself from the lowest stage of development, his 
economic conditions become what he, having certain 
ends in view, desires them to be; and though they in 
turn react on him—if it were not so he would not 
wish to alter them—it would perhaps be truer to say 
that they enable him to be what he desires, than that 
they make him what he is. 
If now we approach the question of the organisa- 
tion of the Family with this line of thought in our 
minds, we find one school of sociologists inclining to 
the view that we must seek for an explanation of it, 
as of all other human institutions, in the economic 
conditions prevalent at any given place or time. It 
requires certain economic conditions to call it into 
being, it changes its form to correspond to changes 
in those conditions, and still further changes in those 
conditions may lead to its total disappearance. 
Perhaps the most systematic attempt to trace this 
connection is that of Dr. E. Grosse in his book Die 
Formen der Familie und die Formen der Wirth- 
schaft. “ We shall show,” he says, “ that the different
-P-A-G-E-50
  VY 44 THE FAMILY PART I 
forms of the Family correspond to the different 
forms of Industry (Wirthschaft), that the character 
of each particular form of Family can be explained in 
its essential features by the character of the form of 
industry in which it is noted.” It is true, he adds, 
that many other factors also exert an influence upon 
the organisation and function of the Family, but he 
proposes to confine himself to that which he holds to 
be the most powerful—the economic conditions. At 
the same time, important as he considers these to be, 
he does not admit that there have ever been economic 
conditions under which the Family did not exist. 
He begins by distinguishing the three main forms in 
which the Family organises itself. These vary primarily 
in extent. They are: the Sonderfamilie, consisting of 
two generations only, parents and their children; the 
/Grossfamilie, which includes three or four generations; 
and the Sippe, or clan, which is a group of persons bound 
together by acommon ancestry. Within the Sippe he. 
distinguishes again the Vatersippe, or clan in which 
descent is counted through males alone, and the Mutter- 
sippe, in which descent is counted through females. 
Not only does he consider that the form which the 
Family takes is determined by economic conditions ; 
he also maintains that economic considerations have 
always been by far the most potent in determining 
marriage—both the fact of marriage and the choice 
of a particular husband or wife. Men seek wives who 
will support them, or wives who will be good house- 
keepers ; above all, wives who will bear them children. 
ve they desire children again for economic reasons : 
   
-P-A-G-E-51
cHar.1t IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 45 
daughters that they may be sold, sons who may work 
and fight for them, who may feed them not only in 
this life, but also in the next. Some concession, 
indeed, he is prepared to make to the “ mutual 
fondness” between parents and children, but this he 
thinks exists mainly between mother and child. A 
father has to learn to love his children, while children 
regard a father more with reverent fear than with any 
heartfelt liking. 
Whether the desire for children can really be 
explained away into such crude elements, even in the 
lower stages of human development, seems open to 
doubt. The theory seems indeed to imply a much 
too advanced power of calculation for the simple 
savage. It is said that one reason why the lower 
tribes never proceed to an agricultural or pastoral life 
is, that they have not the foresight and patience 
required to await the processes of Nature. If this is 
the case where a year or less is sufficient to bring the 
desired result, is it not crediting them with rather much 
economic foresight to suppose that they will arrange 
a mariage de convenance, not merely for the services 
of the wife—which indeed are immediate, and imply 
little foresight—but for the sake of advantages which 
will not accrue for periods varying from ten to twenty 
years? At a higher stage of intellectual development, 
no doubt, such nice calculations of profit and loss may 
form an important element in the value which a father 
attaches to his children; but then there will also be 
a very much greater complexity of feeling We 
have already seen how, amongst certain peoples, the
-P-A-G-E-52
  46 THE FAMILY PART I 
motives which make the desire for children the most 
imperative in life have passed into a highly spiritu- 
alised religion, quite as far removed from any 
merely economic consideration as Christianity itself. 
In considering the effect of industry upon the 
different forms assumed by the Family, Grosse proceeds 
to distinguish five types of peoples, characterised by 
being at five stages of economic development. These 
are: the peoples who hunt, and these are subdivided 
again into higher and lower; the pastoral peoples 
who tend flocks and herds; and the agricultural 
peoples, these: also being divided into higher and 
lower. None of these divisions are absolute, but they 
represent the nature of the main occupations of the 
people concerned. 
_ I. The Lower Howrers are the tribes which re- 
present the lowest stage of development known to us. 
That they are “ primitive,” in the sense of represent- 
ing the earliest stage through which mankind has 
passed, it is impossible to affirm. Even such a small 
amount of culture as they possess is the result of a 
long process of experience and development; while the 
suggestion has been made that some at least of them 
are the degraded remnants of a people once living 
under better conditions, and possessing a much higher 
degree of culture. Their food consists of animals 
slain by the men, and of roots and fruits collected by 
the women. Owing to the poverty of their lands 
and the rudeness of their weapons, they soon exhaust 
the resources of a neighbourhood, and only a perpetual  
-P-A-G-E-53
  coar. ut IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 47 
wandering preserves them from famine, while they 
constantly suffer from hunger. Hence their numbers 
never grow large; a high death-rate and the practice 
of infanticide preserve the relations between popula- 
tion and subsistence, and it is only occasionally and 
for short periods that they meet together in large 
numbers. This mode of life excludes the possibility 
of developing higher forms of industry, and every one 
makes his own tools and weapons, besides providing 
his own subsistence. Private property is limited to 
the fewest and most indispensable articles, and the 
hunting-ground belongs to all the men of a tribe in 
common. Differences in rank are hardly known, all 
adult men being equal, except that the elder derive a 
certain authority from their richer experience, and 
individuals who can claim magical powers exert some 
influence. What little is known of their religion 
shows a firm belief in the continued life of the soul 
after death, and the desirability of fulfilling certain 
duties towards the departed, generally including the 
provision of food. 
Though there are no marriage laws amongst these 
peoples, the custom of living in Families is universal. 
Generally speaking also they are monogamous, though 
this perhaps is owing rather to poverty than to any 
objection to a plurality of wives. A wife being 
obtained by purchase or exchange is the absolute 
property of the man, and is used or misused at his 
pleasure. All laborious and despised work is imposed 
upon the women; they collect plants, insects, and 
shell-fish, cook the food, carry wood, build the huts,
-P-A-G-E-54
    48 THE FAMILY PART 1 
prepare nets, sacks, and clothing, and when the tribe 
is on its wanderings carry the whole of its possessions, 
as well as the little children. In short, the position 
of the woman is that of an inferior but useful creature 
—a beast of burden, despised, ill-treated, but valued. 
The relation of the man to his children is similar. 
He regards them as his absolute property, and this 
whether the clan counts relationship through males 
or through females. His power is as complete for a 
time as that of the Roman Pater, but ceases when he 
has handed over his daughter to another man, and 
when his son has passed the tests of manhood. He 
frequently sells his children or exchanges them. 
Children have no rights against their parents. 
There is no system of inheritance, because there is 
nothing to inherit, weapons and tools being left with 
their dead owner, while the land remains the common 
property of the tribe. 
It is thought that the small hordes into which 
these tribes divide themselves while on their wander- 
ings generally consist of members of the same family, 
held together merely by habit and familiarity ; but on 
this point there seems to be considerable uncertainty. 
And though a father’s power over his young children 
is absolute, there is no evidence of such an organisa- 
tion as we find in the typical patriarchal Family. 
II. Where the hunting and fishing grounds are 
exceptionally rich, and the conditions of life are there- 
fore more favourable, we find higher grades of hunters, 
characterised by a fuller development of culture. 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
coar.ur IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 49 
Such especially are the hunters of North America 
and of North-eastern Asia. Owing to the greater 
abundance of food, especially on the coasts, the com- 
munities consist of much larger numbers than among 
the lower hunters, and their settlements are of a 
much more permanent nature. The division of 
labour as between men and women follows the same 
lines ; but both sexes have reached a higher stage of 
efficiency, and a certain amount of specialisation in 
handicraft has been achieved. Moreover, they make 
and produce more than is sufficient for their own 
needs, and are thus enabled to carry on exchange 
with neighbouring peoples and to accumulate wealth 
in various forms, such as skins, blankets, and even 
slaves. The ground is the property of the tribe or 
clan, but “movable property” is sufficiently abun- 
dant to give rise to great inequality in wealth. 
Amongst these peoples the rich have better houses 
than the poor, and a plutocracy is common, influence 
and position being determined principally by wealth. 
There is little political organisation, the largest com- 
munity being the tribe, which holds together but 
loosely. The village communities, having more 
interests in common, are more firmly bound; but the 
strongest social bond is the household. 
The higher hunters, like the lower, live without 
exception in Families (Sonderfamilie). Marriage is   
      
mostly monogamous, a plurality of wives being 
allowed by custom but seldom permitted by circum- 
stances; for here again, owing to the custom of 
purchase, only the rich can afford more than one 
E
-P-A-G-E-56
  50 THE FAMILY PART I 
wife. Sometimes, indeed, instead of purchase, a wife 
may be obtained in exchange for service to her father, 
but in one way or another she must be paid for. 
Here again, therefore, she is regarded as the property 
of her husband and treated as a slave. ‘“ Women are 
made for work,” a chief is quoted as saying, “ one 
woman can drag and carry more than two men.” 
Nor is their position any better amongst those tribes 
which count descent through the mother only, except 
in a few cases where the greater respect in which they 
are held seems to be attributable to the fact that 
the man receives from his wife’s relations a dower, 
which he has to return if he sends her away without 
justification. 
Here, again, the children are regarded as the pro- 
perty of the father while young. Little is known 
about customs of inheritance. Generally speaking, 
the son inherits from the father; sometimes he in- 
herits from the maternal uncle, and where this is 
the case the uncle is apt to have more authority than 
the father. 
Amongst many of the tribes large houses are 
found containing a number of families who are pre- 
sumably closely related. Amongst other tribes these 
“ creat families” form village communities. Whether 
the household community is also an industrial com- 
munity, or how far there is private property in the 
produce of the chase, etc., is not known. 
TI. Pasrorat Propies.—These tribes, whose prin- 
) cipal occupation is tending flocks and herds, seldom Pp 8
-P-A-G-E-57
cHar. ur IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 51 
confine themselves entirely to it; they also practise 
agriculture to some extent, but generally regard it as 
a lower and almost unworthy occupation. It is a 
mistake also to suppose that they are entirely nomadic; 
some few of them never change their dwelling-places, 
and though for most of them wandering has become 
a necessity of their natures, it is always within fairly 
fixed limits, within a domain which is regarded as 
the property of the tribe, and which is frequently 
subdivided amongst particular families (both Sonder- 
familie and Grossfamilie). 
The tending of the herds has developed out of 
the chase, and is always the business of the man. On 
the other hand, the elements of agriculture, together 
with other undignified and laborious work, are left to 
the women or to slaves. Life is generally much 
richer and more comfortable than amongst the hunters, 
but it is exposed to great risks, There is. difficulty 
in developing such industrial activities as architecture 
or pottery ; but the making of textiles and dressing 
of skins, and sometimes working in metals, are 
brought to a high degree of perfection. But the 
nature of the life is on the whole hostile to industry, 
and the men in particular are nearly always lazy and 
phlegmatic. 
While the land is the common property of the 
tribe or clan, the herds are always private property ; 
hence there are great inequalities in wealth, which 
consists entirely m cattle or wives. One reason for 
this inequality 1s the prevalence of war, which enables 
the strong warrior to appropriate the cattle, wives,
-P-A-G-E-58
52 THE FAMILY PART I 
and slaves of hisenemy. ‘Tribal feuds, though petty, 
are almost continuous, and impress a rough and 
savage character upon the pastoral life, which is 
clearly marked in the form of the Family. The tribes 
are scattered over such vast extents of ground that 
only a very strong ruler succeeds in making a political 
unity of them; but among the Bedouin Arabs every 
important family makes a camp in the desert, and 
weaker families attach themselves to the more power- 
ful. The heads of the families are united under one 
chief, who is called the sheikh, but who has no more 
important function than that of presiding in council. 
The family organisation of the herdsman is much 
better known than that of the hunters. The Family 
is based upon a marriage which may be either mono- 
gamous or polygamous, the nomad taking as many 
wives as he can pay for and maintain. Purchase of 
women is an habitual and open business transaction, 
the price being determined according to the rank, 
beauty, and usefulness of the woman. Wife purchase 
is commonly supposed to have succeeded to, and. 
developed out of, wife capture; but this is a mistake. 
There are instances amongst all peoples of women 
being captured for purposes.of marriage ; but never 
as a recognised form of marriage, only as a punishable 
act of violence infringing the limits of right (Grosse, 
p. 105). 
Though polygamy is recognised and desired, the 
number of the herdspeople who actually possess a 
plurality of wives is comparatively small, partly be- 
cause of the high price of women, and partly because
-P-A-G-E-59
    cHarp. mr IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 53 
of the difficulty of keeping up several establishments. 
Very often, again, only one of the women is regarded 
as the legitimiate wife, and her children alone are 
competent to inherit. But all alike are slaves of the 
man who has bought them, and amongst the nomads 
the woman is even more oppressed than amongst 
the hunters, since no other form of industry gives 
the man such overwhelming superiority. The only 
occupations which confer any dignity, herd-tending 
and war, belong to the man, and the women have no 
means of winning respect from the rough herdsmen 
and robbers. Daughters are valued solely in view of 
the future purchase money; and women in general 
are regarded as an investment of capital, the man 
who buys them doing so with the intention of repay- 
ing himself by their work and by the children they 
bear him. 
Generally speaking, the woman has no property, 
and the result of her work belongs to the man ee 
owns her!; but in some tribes a definite settlement 
is made upon her, and in one at least, community of 
property is part of the marriage contract. It always 
remains true, however, that in their mutual personal 
relations the man has all the rights, the woman all 
the duties. But the woman does not break all con- 
nection with her former family, which forms a sort 
of court of appeal for both parties. Sometimes her 
husband accuses her to them, and they undertake her 
punishment ; sometimes she takes refuge with them, 
1 This was the case in England until 1870-74, when the Married Women’s 
Property Acts were passed.
-P-A-G-E-60
  54 THE FAMILY PART I 
and may even remain with them permanently if 
they return the money paid for her. 
Amongst the nomads the man is regarded as lord 
and proprietor of his children, or of any children borne 
by his wives. Until they form independent house- 
holds of their own they work for him and can be sold 
by him as if they were slaves. While they bear 
themselves with the greatest respect towards their 
father, their attitude towards their mother almost 
invariably reflects the general contempt in which 
women are held. In some tribes the authority of the 
father lasts until his death; more often the son 
throws off all allegiance on attaining manhood, and 
neglects or even ill-treats the father who has become 
old or feeble. 
Women are generally excluded also from all share 
in the inheritance, and where they do partake they 
receive a much smaller portion than the sons. The 
general rule is that the eldest son inherits exclusively, 
but sometimes there is equal division amongst sons.’ 
The nomads attach much importance to relation of 
kinship and are proud of their ancestors, these being 
counted in the male line alone. But the feeling is 
not strong enough to bind the members of a clan into 
any close organisation. The feeding of their flocks, 
which necessitates their spreading over much ground, 
makes the Sonderfamilie (two generations) the largest 
group which is economically advantageous ; on the 
other hand, the need for mutual protection prevents 
1 It is worth noting that this paragraph applies almost literally to 
peoples of high civilisation in Western Europe to-day,
-P-A-G-E-61
cHap.r IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 55 
them from wandering too far from their relations. 
Thus it happens that in times of peace they live as 
isolated families; whilst in times of war they gather 
together in “great families” and clans. They have 
no economic interests in common; and when no 
external danger unites them in obedience to the clan 
patriarch, the individual fathers of families go about 
their own business and are little concerned with 
each other. 
v 
Before passing to Grosse’s description of the fourth 
type, the lower agriculturists, it may be interesting 
to study in rather more detail a particular community 
concerning which Le Play has given a full description 
in Les Ouvriers Européens. It is an account of one 
of the villages of the Bachkirs, a semi-nomadic pas- 
toral people living in the Urals, which illustrates 
the transition from a pastoral to an agricultural life. 
In family organisation, and in the position of the 
women, as well as in economic conditions, they share 
the characteristics of both types. 
In the particular village chosen by Le Play for his 
studies, the population consists mainly of these semi- 
nomad Bachkirs, living partly upon the produce of 
the arable lands around the village where they live 
in winter, partly upon herds, especially of mules, 
‘which in summer are taken by the whole community 
up to the pastures on the mountain sides. 
These people have too strong a passion for repose 
ever to attain wealth; but their possession in com- 
mon of a considerable territory, and the organisation
-P-A-G-E-62
    
56 THE FAMILY | PARTI 4 
of the Family, prevent any great poverty. Those 
who are well off take into their families as domestic 
workers such poor orphans as cannot provide for 
themselves, and abundant means of subsistence makes 
it always easy to provide for any who fall into 
temporary distress. What wealth a family has is 
measured principally by the number of wives wedded 
by the chief of the house, and also by the number of 
mules and other animals which he possesses. The 
particular family visited possessed three mules, but 
the chief had only one wife. 
In a Bachkir family it is usual for all the married 
brothers to remain in the paternal house, and com- 
munity of habitation and interests often continues 
after the death of the father. The household in 
question consisted of the families of two brothers, 
consisting of eight members, all under the absolute 
control of the elder brother. All the inhabitants of 
the village belonged to the Mahometan religion, but 
only about half obeyed the precepts of the Koran. 
The children received elementary instruction in a 
school conducted by the Mullah, and the desire for 
education was increasing, those who could afford it 
sending their sons to study as boarders under a cele- 
brated master living 35 kilometres distant. The 
chief vice of the people is their inveterate propensity 
towards a life of pastoral quiet; the utmost at which 
a family aims is the possession of eight or ten 
mules, which would enable it to dispense altogether 
with agriculture and live entirely upon khoumis. 
a women, who are bought by their husbands,  
-P-A-G-E-63
-cHap. tr IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 57 
are absolutely dependent upon them; theirs is the 
heaviest part in the agricultural work, and they do 
the whole of the domestic work, even to saddling 
their husband’s horse whenever he goes out. But as 
mothers their authority is complete, and they no less 
than the father enjoy the respect and affection of the 
children. Moreover, here as elsewhere, notwithstand- 
ing the power of the husband, women will often by 
force of individual character obtain influence even in 
matters concerning the interests of the community. 
With regard to marriage, the first step is that the 
man makes a payment to the parents of the girl, 
which is called the kolime, and remains in their pos- 
session. The kolime increases in proportion to the 
wealth of the families concerned, the physical perfec- 
tions of the bride, the imperfections and age of the 
husband, the number of wives already possessed by 
him, etc. The contract is signed before the Mullah, 
in presence of six witnesses; the man pays down a 
first instalment of the kolime, but the marriage is not 
celebrated nor the woman given to her husband until 
the entire payment has been made, which generally 
involves a delay of three or four years. The parents 
hand over to the girl some domestic animals, clothes, 
and furniture; it is de rigueur that she brings with 
her at least the curtains of her bed. Custom strictly 
prohibits marriage between young people belonging 
to the same village, a fact which seems to point to 
the village community having been originally a family 
community. 
The children are carefully tended while young,
-P-A-G-E-64
  58 THE FAMILY PART I 
and are left to develop in complete freedom from 
work. Towards the age of ten or twelve they begin 
to go to school under the Mullah, who teaches 
reading, writing, and arithmetic, and especially the 
reading of the Koran. The girls, under the sur- 
veillance of an old woman, attend school until 
marriage, being taught in a different class from the 
boys. Owing to the necessity of paying the kolime 
the men never marry until twenty-five or thirty, 
the girls from nineteen to twenty. The father of 
the family generally keeps his married sons with him. 
He disposes of all the goods of the community, and 
determines their transmission after his death by 
means of a will prepared with the help of the 
Mullah, generally assigning to the sons twice as 
much as to the daughters. He has absolute authority 
over all the families united in his household, dis- 
tributing the work, buying and selling, and disposing 
of the common funds. If he dies suddenly, the 
mother, if still living, takes charge of the com 
munity ; one at least of the married sons remaining 
with her, and the others being free to form new 
households. 
With regard to property, it is difficult to dis- 
tinguish precisely between private property and 
subventions from the community. Strictly speak- 
ing, only the houses and their immediate surround. 
ings are private property; but the arable lands and 
hay meadows are assigned to families, and trans 
mitted in them from generation to generation. 
But the rights of the family over its lands att
-P-A-G-E-65
cHAP. mr IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 59 
limited; the community sometimes makes additions 
to them from the reserve land not yet divided, and 
sometimes withdraws into this reserve land from 
which the family to which it has been assigned have 
not taken a crop for some years. This right of 
the community to resume possession is never really 
burdensome to individuals, while it protects them 
from the abuses of mortgage and usury. The rights 
of usage assigned to families over the summer 
pastures, the woods, the game, the fish, wild fruits, 
etc., never bear the character of private property ; 
individuals enjoy them only as members of the 
community and under definite regulation (Les 
Ouvriers Européens, vol. ii.). 
So far as concerns the position of women and ; 
children in the Family, these people have oe : 
considerable progress towards the next stage d 
scribed by Grosse, that of the Lower Agriculturists. 
~> IV. These are the groups “which devote them- A 
selves exclusively or mainly to the cultivation of 
edible plants” ; and they are distinguished by the fact 
that all persons capable of and obliged to work take 
an active part in such production, from the Higher 
Agriculturists, amongst whom many of the workers 
are engaged in manufactures. In numbers the 
people of this stage greatly exceed all the preced- 
ing; but it cannot be said that all of them possess 
a higher culture, many of them being inferior to 
most nomads both in possessions and in culture. 
The most marked new characteristic of this stage
-P-A-G-E-66
60 THE FAMILY PART I 
is, that agriculture requires a life settled in one place, 
and it is this which makes it difficult for hunters 
and herdsmen to make the transition to it. Another 
essential difference lies in the fact that the most 
valuable possession of the tiller of the soil is the land, 
which is not—like the herds of the nomad—his 
‘ private property. Originally at least it is the 
common property of the group. And amongst the 
lower agriculturists, for whom there is abundance of 
land available, the welfare of a community increases 
with its numbers, since agriculture is most easily 
carried on by many working in co-operation. Thus 
agriculture not only holds men in one place, it also 
holds them together by common interests, and has 
therefore a much greater socialising power than 
hunting and herding. 
Equal right to the land gives equal right to the 
produce, and this right is given effect to in various 
ways. The harvest may be divided amongst the 
particular families and individuals, or each may take 
what he needs from the general supplies, or again 
amongst some tribes a special piece of the common 
land is assigned to each family for its use. This 
does not lead, as might be expected, to equality 
amongst the members of the community : individuals 
who are especially active and capable always acquire 
greater possessions (e.g. by taking in waste lands, 
etc.) and also greater power. Moreover, the settled 
life conduces also to the development of industry 
and trade, by which private property is increased ; 
and thus the distinction between rich and poor
-P-A-G-E-67
  CHAP. III IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 61 
appears, notwithstanding the common property in 
land. 
In agriculture we find for the first time that not 
the small Family—the Sonderfamilie—is of most 
importance, but the Sippe or clan, which here 
develops itself into an organised institution far 
exceeding ail others in influence, and controls the 
life and industry of all members of the community. 
These clans may be bound together either by paternal 
or maternal relationship; but the latter seems to 
have been in the past far more prevalent than the 
former; and it is still more powerful amongst the 
agricultural peoples than amongst the hunters and 
herdsmen. The reason for this lies in the nature 
of the industry, for the cultivation of plants was 
originally a form of production belonging essentially 
to women. ‘“ Women invented agriculture” (is not 
this almost equivalent to saying that women in- 
vented civilisation?); and amongst most of the 
more primitive peoples it is carried on almost 
exclusively by women. And it is not only a duty 
of the woman, it is also her right, carrying with it 
other rights, and more especially a right to the land 
which she has made fertile. Many of the tribes in 
this group of peoples hold this view very strongly, 
and the land descends in the clan through the 
mother. 
As the woman’s labour is valuable to the clan in 
which she is born, the man who marries her must 
either compensate for her loss by a money payment, 
or must himself enter into her clan and serve for her. 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  62 THE FAMILY PART I 
For the agriculturist, whose work needs much labour, 
it is as important to increase the numbers of his 
Family, as it is for the herdsman to increase the 
numbers of his herds, And it is owing to the value 
of her work that the woman, though still subordinate 
to the man, yet meets with better treatment amongst 
the agriculturists than amongst the herdsmen and 
hunters. Marriage is usually monogamous, but here 
again polygamy is recognised. 
It is amongst the agriculturists alone that actual 
instances of matriarchal clans are known as distinct 
from the clans which are merely characterised by the 
maternal system of relationship. But even here they 
are rare, the maternal clans themselves being 
generally under the guidance of the oldest or most 
respected men. The same is true of the families; 
where the women are strong in the clan, the position 
of women and children is strong in the Family ; but 
for the most part the Family is under the rule of the 
father. And when the paternal kinship rules in the 
clan, then the sway of the man is absolute; he is 
lord and proprietor of wives and children." 
The Germans, as described by Czesar, lived in 
village communities which were also clans or groups 
of relations. The same organisation is found at the 
present day amongst the Slavs. Those of them who 
are agriculturists live and work in household com- 
munities. Each such household (zadruga) consists of 
a group of descendants of the same ancestor, who 
1 Jt seems probable that the Bachkir village described by Le Play (see 
above) represented a Sippe or clan, from the fact that marriages within the 
community were prohibited,
-P-A-G-E-69
cHap.11 IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 63 
live together, possess their land and cultivate it in 
common, and consume the produce of their work in 
common. The numbers contained in the household 
used to be greater; but the organisation remains 
the same. The chief of the “zadruga” is called 
“starjesina,” and is either nominated by his pre- 
decessor, or chosen by his companions. He assigns 
the daily tasks, superintends the work, and disposes 
of the income; but he cannot entirely dispense with 
the assent of the other adult members of the Family, 
and according to modern ideas it is not he who owns 
all the property, but the community, including the 
women. Nevertheless, the women hold a very sub- 
ordinate position ; “if a woman meets a man in the 
road, even if he is younger than she, she must kiss 
his hand.” 
In Russia a similar organisation still exists over 
immense tracts of country. The “bolschaja” unites 
several generations and households allied by the 
bonds of blood and of common interests. It often 
happens that several married sons, several households 
of collateral relatives, live together in the same house, 
or on the same farm, where they work together under 
the rule of father or grandfather. All the property 
is held in common. Generally there is no inheritance 
or division of property. House, garden, implements, 
cattle, harvests, utensils of every kind, remain the 
common property of the Family from one generation 
to another. No one thinks of claiming a special 
share for himself. When the father of the Family 
dies, the respect and rule either passes to the eldest
-P-A-G-E-70
64 THE FAMILY PART I 
man of the community, his brother or son ; or some- 
times the Family chooses a new head. Out of the 
“Dolschaja” has grown the “mir,” the Russian 
village community. This, again, is not merely an 
administrative unit, but a patriarchal community, 
an extension of the Family, into which a stranger 
cannot be admitted without the consent of the 
majority. This village clan possesses the land in 
common, divides it at certain periods amongst the 
individual households, and determines the time and 
nature of work in the fields. 
Though we find that agriculture thus increases the 
power of the clan as against the Family, it has never 
resulted in completely superseding it. And the clan 
itself is strong only so long as it possesses the land 
in common; it breaks down so soon as this is taken 
from it. Moreover, as soon as agriculture ceases to 
be the ruling form of Production, the clan organisa- 
tion is doomed: and it is here that we enter upon 
the fifth and final stage of culture, that of the Higher 
Agriculturists. 
V. It is characteristic of the peoples in this stage, 
that while agriculture continues to be carried on it is 
left to one section of the people alone, the others 
turning to different occupations. Manufactures tend 
to become more and more important, and these 
peoples might be called more appropriately manu- 
acturing. The change brings with it a change in 
the relative values of different kinds of property ; 
the greater part of the wealth consisting in objects 
produced by manufacture and not by agriculture.
-P-A-G-E-71
cHarp. mt IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 65 
Amongst the lower agriculturists it is immovable 
common property which preponderates ; amongst the 
higher, not only the enormously increased amount of 
movable property, but the greater part of the land 
itself is private property. But the most important 
differences arise out of the advance in division of 
labour, owing to which the people of the later type 
are not only far more differentiated, but also, because 
of their mutual dependence, far more integrated, 
than the people who live in comparatively self- 
suflicing productive groups. 
There are two types of this higher order of 
peoples. The first and oldest is that in which the 
“oreat Family ” prevails, and which is represented by 
the ancient civilisation of Europe, and by the Chinese 
and Japanese of to-day. 
The second consists of the Western European 
peoples and their kindred; and in it the Sonder- 
familie—the Family of two generations—prevails.’ 
It is in the first that we find the typical patri- 
archal Family, the “great Family,” which is under 
the dominion of the Patriarch. This Family group 
always existed within the clan; but so long as the 
clan maintained its power the authority of the 
Patriarch was limited, and it was only when the 
clan broke down, that the Patriarch, inheriting its 
power in addition to his own, became full autocrat.? 
We have already seen what the Patriarchal 
1 This is only partially true ; see accounts of French families. 
® This is the explanation of the Patriarchal authority from the economic 
point of view, and it is interesting to compare it with the explanation 
through ancestor-worship, which is also admitted by Grosse. 
F
-P-A-G-E-72
66 THE FAMILY * PART I 
Family was in Rome and still is in Japan. In China 
also the “great Family” continues to maintain its 
industrial organisation. All earnings of the members 
of the Family flow into the common chest, and this 
is controlled by the Patriarch. But the Patriarch’s 
power, though great, is limited by documentary 
family statutes, which determine expenditure in 
different directions and assign duties and punish- 
ments. The women in the Family are completely 
subordinate ; a girl is held to be incapable of either 
virtues or crimes; and the power of the man over 
his wife extends to his children and is unlimited. 
The “great family” holds together only so long 
as the father is able to maintain his authority over 
successive generations. But in Western Europe this 
‘uthority has gradually disappeared before other 
Sioa stronger influences: that of the State, that of 
Religion, and that of changed economic conditions, 
which have made it easy for the younger members 
of the Family to break away and earn their living 
independently. Thus we get once more, as the 
typical family unit of modern civilisation, the 
original Sonderfamilie, the two parents and their 
dependent children. 
Before proceeding to consider in detail the nature 
of this modern Family in its relation to external 
influences, we may pause to consider how far this 
survey justifies the view that the form of the Family 
is dependent upon economic conditions. It is sum-
-P-A-G-E-73
cHar. mt IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 67 
marised almost entirely from Grosse’s Die Formen 
der Familie und die Formen der Wirthschaft, and 
though it is necessarily brief, I have endeavoured to 
preserve in it all the main features upon which the 
argument depends. 
In the first place, we find that the Family in its 
ultimate form persists throughout all economic con- 
ditions without exception. So far, therefore, there is 
no justification for the view that, being dependent 
upon certain economic conditions, it will disappear if 
those particular conditions disappear. 
In the second place, so far as we are able to 
analyse the connection, it would seem to be quite as 
descriptive of the facts to say that the Family, by 
the form it takes, creates its own economic con- 
ditions, as that its form depends upon economic 
conditions. For instance, the Family in its simplest 
form, by recognising the dependence of the weak 
upon the strong, creates the necessity for its respon- 
sible head to produce, or in some way provide, more 
sustenance than is needed for himself alone. This 
is an economic condition of the very highest im- 
portance, and one which no other institution but 
that of the Family or slavery can ensure. 
Again, the organisation of the Family group 
under one controlling head enables that co-operation 
in labour which is essential to the successful pursuit 
of industry. In the absence of a system of wage- 
labour or of slavery this is again an essential 
economic condition, and one upon which the de- 
velopment of agriculture, as we have seen, more
-P-A-G-E-74
68 THE FAMILY PART I 
especially depended. But it is, I think, impossible 
to say which position has most truth in it—that the 
stronger organisation of the Family has enabled and 
led to the development of agriculture, or that the 
development of agriculture has determined the form 
of the Family. Why, for instance, did not the lower 
insect-catching hunters develop the Patriarchal Family 
which would have enabled them to carry on agri- 
culture. It was not that they were too much 
scattered by their way of life (see p. 48), but simply 
that the same low level of intellect which prevented 
the woman from taking her proper place in the 
Family, and prevented the higher organisation of the 
Family for industrial purposes, also prevented the 
discovery of agriculture and its pursuit. At the 
utmost it would seem that all we can say with 
certainty is, that at an early stage of development 
we find a particular form of the Family connected 
with agriculture, but that agriculture has persisted 
long after that form of the Family has broken down, 
and that, therefore, the connection is not a permanent 
or essential one. 
One way of stating the relation between the form 
of the Family and its economic conditions might 
be to say that the variety of occupations open to the 
members of a Family determines how far they will be 
forced by mutual dependence to hold together, and 
how far able to assert their individual freedom. Or, 
from another point of view, that the nature of their 
occupation determines how far they will be able to hold 
together, and how far forced to separate. But then
-P-A-G-E-75
  cHaP. ut IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 69 
it must be borne in mind that the variety of occupa- 
tions itself depends most intimately upon the nature 
of the Family. Until the village communities broke 
up and set free a supply of wage-labour, there was 
no possibility of any great development of industry ; 
just as there was no possibility of the development 
of agriculture until the father could control the 
adult members of his family to co-operate with him. 
There is even greater difficulty after our survey in 
accepting the saying from which we started this 
chapter, that “a people is what it eats.” As a 
theory of development it breaks down completely as 
soon as we consider the stage at which we have now 
arrived. From the point of view of what we eat we 
are all hunters, all pastors, all agriculturists. It is 
far more what we do which is characteristic of the 
sort of people we are than what we eat, and of 
course in the days when occupations are directed 
almost entirely to the production of food the two 
points of view tend to coincide. To-day it is no less 
true that for the great majority of people their 
energies are directed ultimately towards the pro- 
curing of food by means of exchange ; but while every 
one expects to get much the same kind of food, vast 
numbers are engaged, as Grosse points out, in work 
which has nothing to do with actual food production. 
And when we look for differences of type amongst 
modern peoples, we find them largely following the 
lines of occupation; the coal-miner and the city 
clerk, the navvy and the shop-assistant, the sailor 
and the soldier, the tramp and the skilled artisan,
-P-A-G-E-76
  70 THE FAMILY PART I 
are differentiated in character, habits, and capacities 
far more by the nature of what they do than by any 
difference in their food, which at the most is a 
difference of amount rather than of kind. But how- 
ever marked these differentiations are, they can 
hardly be said to have affected the typical form of 
the Family in any modern community. It is true 
that the differences between what we may call the 
family habit of—let us say—the sailor, the tramp, 
and the city clerk, would be found, I imagine, far 
more marked than between those of the higher 
hunters and the herdsman; but the recognised form 
remains the same for all members of the community, 
whatever their occupations and habits. 
There is one more difficulty which I find in giving 
pre-eminence to economic conditions as determining 
the form of the Family. It is the fact that the 
migratory habits of civilised peoples have shown over 
and over again, in the past as in the present, that 
when they are placed under the same economic condi- 
tions as tribes of a lower order of development, they 
do not, at any rate necessarily or even often, adopt 
the institutions of the aborigines. It may have been 
the economic conditions of North America which 
caused the Indians to organise themselves in clans 
sometimes matriarchal, often maternal; but why, 
then, have they had no such effect upon the peoples 
of every nationality which have entered the country 
since?* And Mussulman, Hindoo, and European live 
1 Unless indeed the sociologist will trace some such causal effect in the 
social predominance of the American woman,
-P-A-G-E-77
  cHar.m IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY 71 
side by side under the same economic conditions in 
India, and each preserves his own typical family life. 
And if, like Grosse, we take the meaning of the term 
“economic conditions” to refer chiefly to a man’s 
occupations—the acts which flow out of him, rather 
than the food which goes into him—then, as we have 
seen, the form of the Family is itself one of the 
principal conditions determining those acts. 
Here I must guard myself from misunderstanding, 
by pointing out that the question whether in any 
given generation the form of the Family is determined 
by economic conditions, is not to deny that economic 
conditions have influenced the development of peoples 
in the past. It may well be that the American of 
to-day only fails to organise himself into maternal 
clans because his inherited constitution has been 
moulded by long generations of European conditions. 
We might, indeed, go so far as to admit that any 
given man is only the summary, the epitome, the 
concentrated essence of the conditions and surround- 
ings of long lines of ancestors; but that very fact 
would only make him all the stronger to resist his 
own immediate surroundings where they failed to 
harmonise with the past which he represents and 
the future which he desires. It is a momentary and 
diffused present against an age-long and .concen- 
trated past; and to say that the past will win the 
day, and mould the present to suit its vision of the 
future, is only to say that man the spirit is lord over 
nature,
-P-A-G-E-78
  CHAPTER IV 
THE FAMILY IN RELATION TO PROPERTY 
Accorpine to some authorities the word Family 
itself means property. “The true meaning of 
familia is property; it designates the field, the 
house, the money, the slaves. . . . As for olxos, it 
clearly presents to the mind no other idea than that 
of property or domicile.” We find a similar identi- 
fication of ideas in the English use of the term 
“House” to mean family—the “ruling house”; and 
the German Haus as meaning Stamm. 
But this should not suggest the idea that the use 
of the word Family to include both living members 
and property implies that wife and children were 
the property of the man in the same sense as a house 
or garden are now private property. We have seen 
that in many stages of civilisation they actually are 
so regarded; but the typical patriarchal familia, 
while it included both material and human elements, 
and though the authority of the Paterfamilias was so 
great, nevertheless did not belong to him “to do 
what he liked with.” It was only as representing 
the “familia” that he held his authority, and he had 
1 Fustel de Coulanges, La Cité Antique, p. 118. 
72  
-P-A-G-E-79
  cuaPp.Iv IN RELATION TO PROPERTY 73 
no power to alienate the property from the Family. 
The members of the Family and the property of the 
Family were indissolubly connected; and so far as 
there was any question of “belonging,” all belonged 
alike to the domestic god, or to the Family in the 
- extended sense which included all generations, past 
and future as well as present. In the succession of 
generation to generation “it is not the property 
which passes from one man to another, but the man 
who passes.”* Even in our modern use of the 
possessive case with respect to the Family, it means 
no more than relationship, and conveys no idea 
of “possession” in the sense of being able to do 
what we like with it. A man speaks, no doubt, of 
“my children,” or “my wife,” but he speaks also of 
omy ancestors ”; while wife and child themselves 
speak of “my husband” and “my father.” The 
usage is parallel with our habit of taking as it were 
into our possession whatever we are habitually busied 
about or interested in, without any implication of 
real ownership. A housemaid will say “I have not 
swept my stairs yet”; a cook will talk of “my 
kitchen”; a doctor of “my patients” ; a hypochon- 
driac of “ my indigestion” ; while a man less interested 
in his ailments will be content to suffer indigestion 
without appropriating it. 
Now this connection between a Family and its 
property, or rather this inclusion of property within 
the circle of the Family, is one of the most charac- 
1 La Cité Antique, p. 78.
-P-A-G-E-80
  74 THE FAMILY PART I 
teristic features of family life at certain stages of its 
development; while it is in the varying relations of 
the different members of the Family to the property 
of the Family that we find the most striking diver- 
gencies in the modern forms of the Family. 
It is, for instance, the relation of the Patriarchal 
Family to its property, quite as much as the 
authority of the Patriarch, which gives it such a 
concrete solidarity and strength. Here the power 
of the “dead hand” is no figure of speech or legal 
fiction; rather it is the living hand of the dead, 
maintaining its grip upon the family goods and 
stretching through the shadowy past to claim its 
share in the present.’ Even the unborn generations 
to come, by their indissoluble connection with the 
family property, anticipate their life, and are a 
living force amongst the living. And when ancestor- 
worship ceases to be a religion, and the dead loosen 
their hold, when the property ceases to be con- 
secrated to the divine, then its consecration to the 
human, to the service of those generations of the 
Family who still live and are to come, may preserve 
for it much of its steadying and ennobling power. It 
loses that power and becomes a source of discord and 
strife, only when the family spirit has vanished, 
and each member seeks in it his own lesser ends. 
Those who have watched the breaking up of the

Patriarchal Family as we still find it in certain parts 
of Europe, cite significant instances of the changes 
which accompany the dissolution of this relationship 
between the Family and its property. If we partly 
follow the terminology used by Le Play, we may 
describe the true Patriarchal Family as rigid; under 
the pressure of the changing conditions of modern 
life—as the process is described—this rigidity gives 
way, becomes pliable, and we get from it two new 
types of family life:—the stable Family, which 
succeeds in combining change and permanence; and 
the unstable, which fails to maintain its core of 
strength and permanence, and becomes a mere suc- 
cession of disconnected individuals with no strength 
beyond what each possesses in himself. To illustrate 
this process of disintegration we may turn once more 
to the Patriarchal Family in Russia, where it is 
essentially in a transition stage. I will quote first 
from Le Play’s account of the Family in Russia fifty 
years ago, and then from more recent accounts by 
Stepniak and Mackenzie Wallace. From Le Play, 
whose work is too little known, I quote at length, in 
order to indicate something of his characteristic 
(though sometimes misinterpreted) view of the in- 
fluence of family life upon social well-being. 
To the reader of this generation, accustomed to 
hear of nothing from Eastern Europe but “atrocities” 
and discontent, oppression and revolution, it seems 
strange to find Le Play exhibiting the inhabitants of 
Russia, Hungary, and Austria as models of contented 
prosperity to the restless West. But it must be
-P-A-G-E-82
76 THE FAMILY PART I 
remembered, in the first place, that he writes of dwellers 
in the country and not of dwellers in the towns; in 
the second place, that he writes of the people who 
work with their hands and not of the “intellectual” 
or of the ruling classes ; and, finally, that he is writing 
before the emancipation of 1848 and 1856 had dis- 
turbed the relations subsisting between the people 
and the land on the one hand, and the people and 
their seigneurs on the other. 
The causes of this state of contented prosperity 
he held to be three: (i.) a firm belief in the Divine 
origin of the moral law, i.e. the Decalogue; (ii.) the 
universally prevailing institution of the Patriarchal 
Family ; and (iii.) an abundance of fertile soil. 
It is the second of these causes which concerns us 
here, and in which indeed Le Play himself is most 
interested. “The old parents, finding ample means 
of subsistence in the nature of their locality, are able 
to gather round them four generations of their own 
blood. The father of the family, whose power is 
justified by his long experience, possesses the neces- 
sary ascendency to hold both youth and ripe age in 
submission to the Decalogue and to custom. Under 
this régime peace and stability extend from the 
family to the entire race.”* That is to say, this 
organisation of the Family with its submission to 
the authority of its chief, is reflected into the 
organisation of the State, and is the school in which 
submission to the ruler is learned. 
“The Russian Family is organised upon bases

cuar.Iv IN RELATION TO PROPERTY Nee 
quite different from those which prevail in the 
centre and west of Europe. Those who partake of 
the same blood continue to hold property and goods 
in common so long as the size of the house permits 
them to live together. A father generally retains 
with him several married sons, their wives and 
children. Even after the death of the father it 
will often happen that the brothers continue their 
life in common under the direction of the mother, 
or of that member of the family who is judged most 
capable of exercising the functions of chief (Starchi). 
This combination of three generations prevents the 
usage of the family name to designate individuals, 
hence from time immemorial it has been found 
necessary to call each individual both by his own 
baptismal name and by that of his father. . . . 
“The patriarchal organisation of the family, the 
security due to the protection of the seigneur, the 
ample means of subsistence of each family, impresses 
social relations with a propriety and dignity rarely 
found at the other extremity of Europe at the same 
level. Religious fétes and family anniversaries bring 
relations and friends frequently together, and then 
the hospitality exercised is of the freest and most 
dignified. Several families . . . are attaining by order 
and economy to a considerable fortune, but. this 
interest’ never degenerates into sordid avarice nor 
leads to any neglect of the obligation which every 
head of a family must fulfil towards his children, 
his friends, and the community of which he forms 
part... . All the families, with rare exceptions, show
-P-A-G-E-84
  78 THE FAMILY PART I 
much attachment to established usages. They in- 
stinctively repel innovations, even those which 
would have the best influence upon the state of 
agriculture and the physical or moral condition 
of the population. This conservative spirit, as if 
to compensate its advantages, often degenerates into 
a blind and obstinate routine. 
“So far as concerns the moral side of life, religion, 
the relations of kindred, solemnities, recreations, and 
even medical practices, the women show themselves 
as much attached to custom as the men. On the 
other hand, in all that concerns dress and food they 
show a considerable tendency to innovation, so much 
so that the Starchis consider it their duty to watch 
them closely in this respect”; one Starchi observed, 
“with much finesse and a profound knowledge of 
the human heart, that it is always the women who 
lead man to change the established order.” 
“The father or Starchi assigns the work and dis- 
poses of the produce, and the members of the family 
are to him as domestic workers. . . . The children, in 
every house, brought up amongst many brothers and 
sisters, know nothing of the isolation which youth 
often experiences in the West. Their only instruc- 
tion consists in a few religious ideas imparted by the 
priest, and they are left free to develop without render- 
ing any services to the family beyond some amount of 
attention to the animals and the gathering of mush- 
rooms and fruits. At the age of fourteen the boys 
work both for the family and for the seigneur, while 
the girls, before marriage, work only for the family.”
-P-A-G-E-85

« Tnstitutions and manners generally encourage pre- 
cocious marriage ; that is for boys from seventeen to 
twenty years, for girls from eighteen to twenty-four/ _-- 
years. Owing to the abundance of land at their dis- 
posal and the incessant growth of means of subsistence, 
parents have no anxiety as to the lot of the next genera- 
tion. For the seigneur, as for every family of peasants, 
the increase of population is an assured means of pros- 
perity. The interests of the individual are equally 
served by these youthful marriages. The young 
women find in their new state an independence and 
consideration which they lacked before. Under the 
régime of the numerous community to which they 
are admitted, they are assisted by the older parents 
in the cares demanded by the young children; thus 
they are less burdened by work than young mothers 
are in the system of isolation which is coming to 
prevail more and more in the Western organisation 
of the family. On his side, a young man of an age 
to marry occupies an unsatisfactory position in the 
community, in some respects unendurable; for in- 
stance, it is almost impossible for him to get suitable 
clothing. His sisters-in-law are naturally occupied 
in the first instance in looking after the linen and 
clothes of their husbands; the prime interest of his 
young unmarried sisters is the preparation of their 
trousseau; the old mother, when still living, is 
absorbed in superintending family affairs, or in the 
care of her husband and grandchildren; she can 
hardly attend to an adult unmarried son. Thus, 
even if he were not naturally drawn towards it, he
-P-A-G-E-86
80 THE FAMILY PART I 
must seek in marriage the way out of a false position, 
and thus lighten the charge he inflicts upon other 
members of the community. 
“The comfort and well-being of the family de- 
pend éssentially upon the ancient organisation by 
which three or four young households live in 
common; and this state of things itself can only 
be maintained in a society which confers absolute 
authority upon the chief of the family. Hence the 
keystone of the social system of Russia is patriarchal 
authority, which both customs and institutions tend 
to maintain. 
“The patriarchal régime harmonises well in 
Russia with other influences; in a social order 
where school education contributes in no way to 
the precocious development of youth, where know- 
ledge is acquired only by the practice of life and of 
social relations, the old men actually have an enor- 
mous superiority over the young. The latter are 
conscious of their inferiority, and when in Russia 
one asks a man of forty about some fact, he never 
fails to answer that such information can only be 
properly given by some one older. The régime is 
confirmed, moreover, by religious sentiment ; thus it 
is almost unknown that a son should make up his 
mind to an act of formal disobedience, and so 
incur the paternal malediction. In the compara- 
tively rare cases where the ascendency of the father 
is insufficient to maintain the harmony necessary to 
the common life, when more especially the dissen- 
sions arising amongst his daughters-in-law threaten to
-P-A-G-E-87
cuarp.tv IN RELATION TO PROPERTY 81 
provoke the dispersion of the family, the father has 
recourse to the authority of the seigneur. In fact, 
the permission of the latter is necessary in principle 
when there is occasion to divide a family; it is 
equally necessary in practice in the sense that the 
construction of a new habitation can only take place 
by means of dispensations from work and allocations 
of material on the part of the seigneur. Such re- 
course to the seigneur is rare in the land of Tachli; 
but when it does occur, he himself appeals to an 
assembly composed of all the elders of the village 
to which the family belongs; experience has taught 
him that the most useful plan in such a case is to 
decide according to the opinion of this council. 
“At the death of the father of the family his 
authority passes, the seigneur approving, to that one 
of his brothers or sons whom he has nominated or 
whom the family itself has chosen. This approval 
of the seigneur is no source of conflict, for the interest 
of the seigneur and that of the whole family coincide 
in assigning the authority to the member most 
capable of exercising it. The same influences and 
interests come into play when the growth of the 
family no longer admits of their living together, 
when it becomes necessary to create a new home, 
and to assign to the new branch a share in the 
animals, furniture, and goods in general acquired 
by the community. 
“The social system of which we have here 
sketched the principal features consists then essen- 
tially in the triple subordination of the individual to 
G 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
82 THE FAMILY PART 1 
the family, to the communal council, and to the 
seigneur. Eminent individuals, who in the social 
systems of the West work mainly for their own 
elevation, in the Russian system must devote them- 
selves to the well-being of members of the family 
who are less happily endowed, to the prosperity of 
their commune, to the splendour of the seignorial 
house, finding in case of misfortune, or declining 
age, support and assistance in the three groups of 
collective interests which they have served since 
youth. Briefly, under this régime social forces con- 
tribute more to stability than to progress. 
“The advantages of this system are more pro- 
nounced where individuals have little strength of 
their own. . . . They will diminish, and those which 
are proper to the Western system will increase in 
proportion as the refinement of religious sentiment 
and the rational progress of the means of education 
assure to young people that power over themselves, 
that knowledge and power of initiative, which under 
the present régime can only be acquired by men of 
advanced age.”? 
This, then, is a picture of the Patriarchal organisa- 
tion at its best, as seen by a sympathiser and admirer. 
Stepniak in his book on the Russian Peasantry, 
writing a generation later, when the influences fore- 
seen by Le Play have become increasingly prominent, 
throws a somewhat different light upon it. No doubt 
the autocratic power of the Patriarch might often 
1 Les Ouvriers Européens, vol. ii. pp. 51 sq.
-P-A-G-E-89
  cHaP.Iv IN RELATION TO PROPERTY 83 
degenerate into a tyranny which would be resented 
by the younger members of the Family, and would 
tend wherever these saw their way to independence 
to the breaking up of the system; and it is this side 
of the life which modern conditions tend to make 
increasingly prominent. 
“Something harsh, cruel, cynically egotistical, is 
worming itself into the hearts of the Russian agri- 
cultural population, where formerly all was simplicity, 
peace and goodwill unto men. Thus the grey-bearded 
grandfathers are not alone in modern Russia in 
lamenting the good old times. Some of our young 
and popular writers are, strangely enough, striking 
the same wailing chords. It is evident that in the 
terrible straits through which our people are passing, 
not only their material condition, but their very 
souls have suffered grave injuries. Yet it is not all 
lamentation about the past in the tidings which 
reach us from our villages. The good produced by 
the progress of culture is, in spite of its drawbacks, 
according to our modest opinion, full compensation 
for the impairing of the almost unconscious virtues 
of the old patriarchal period. Freed from the yoke 
of serfdom, and put before the tribunals on an equal 
footing with other citizens, a new generation, which 
has not known slavery, has had time to grow up. 
Their aspiration after independence has not yet 
directed itself against political despotism, save in 
isolated cases; but in the meantime it has almost 
triumphed in the struggle against the more intimate 
and trying domestic despotism of the bolshak, the head
-P-A-G-E-90
84 THE FAMILY PART I 
of the household. A very important and thorough- 
going change has taken place in the family relations 
of the great Russian rural population. The children, 
as soon as they have grown up and have married, 
will no longer submit to the bolshak’s whimsical 
rule. They rebel, and if imposed upon, separate and 
form new households, where they become masters of 
their own actions. These separations have grown so 
frequent that the number of independent households 
in the period from 1858-1881 increased from 32 
per cent to 71 per cent of the whole provincial 
population. It is worthy of remark that the re- 
bellion among the educated classes also first began 
in the circle of domestic life, before stepping into 
the larger arena of political action.” 
We may imagine that if Le Play had lived to 
read of this domestic rebellion he would hardly have 
failed to connect with it the ‘something harsh, cruel, 
and cynically egotistical” which Stepniak himself 
deprecates in the Russian peasantry of to-day.’ 
Nor would he have been slow to find one of its 
causes in the spread of education which he foresaw. 
“Elementary education, however hampered and 
obstructed by the Government, is spreading amongst 
the rural classes. In 1868, of a hundred recruits of 
peasant origin there were only eight who could read 
and write. In 1882 the proportion of literate people 
among the same number was twenty. This is little 
compared with what might have been done, but it 
is a great success if we remember the hindrances the 
1 Stepniak, The Russian Peasantry.
-P-A-G-E-91
cHar.Iv. IN RELATION TO PROPERTY 85 
peasant has had to overcome. Reading, which a 
score of years ago was confined exclusively to the 
upper classes, is now spreading among the mowjeks. 
Popular literature of all kinds has received an un- 
precedented development in the last ten or fifteen 
years. Popular books run through dozens of editions, 
and are selling by scores of thousands of copies.” ? 
Economic causes are fighting both for and against 
the maintenance of the family organisation in Russia. 2——~ 
On the one hand, it is not only the growing desire 
for independence which tempts the adult worker to 
seek his fortunes apart from those of his Family ; the 
pressure of taxation makes it absolutely necessary 
that some of the Family should become wage-earners 
in the towns or elsewhere, if enough of the produce 
of the homestead is to be preserved for the mainten- 
ance of the Family; and the wage-earner who has 
learned to live under his own guidance and to feel 
the means of independence within his hands, be- 
comes more and more disinclined to submit himself 
again to the patriarchal rule, though he may continue 
for a time to contribute to the family income. 
On the other hand, it is the large organised 
Families which can best withstand the pressure of 
increasing poverty: “‘Only very large families, 
which are becoming less common, are able to ex- 
tricate themselves from the usurer’s net in which 
they have been by dire misfortune entangled. When 
the liability is divided amongst twelve or more adults 
this may compensate for the absence of one or two 
1 Stepniak, The Russian Peasantry.
-P-A-G-E-92
86 THE FAMILY PART I 
of their number ‘given in bondage’ by increased 
diligence on the part of those that remain. But 
small families almost inevitably succumb.” * 
This function of the patriarchal organisation as a 
defence, both of the Families themselves in times of 
distress and weakness, and of the weaker members 
who are unfit to stand alone, was one to which Le 
Play attached great importance; and it seems likely 
that its dissolution will lead to a great increase of 
the numbers of those in the community who are 
permanently poverty-stricken. Nevertheless, Stepniak 
at least considers it to be doomed: “The vigour of 
the big patriarchal families is sapped by the lowest 
instincts as well as by the loftiest aspirations de- 
veloped by modern times. They are incompatible 
with individual independence. Amongst the southern 
Russians, with whom the sentiment of individuality 
is much stronger than amongst the great Russians, 
these composite households are unknown. Their rapid 
dissolution among the Russians would have been an 
unmitigated good if it were not accompanied by 
the general relaxation of social ties between all the 
members of the village community.” * 
Mackenzie Wallace gives a similar account of the 
mingled good and evil attending the dissolution of 
the Patriarchal Family in his book on Russia: 
“Russian peasants are human beings like our- 
selves. . . . And those of them who live in large 
families are subjected to a kind of probation which 
most of us have never dreamed of. The families 
1 The Russian Peasantry, p. 68. 2 Ibid.

  cHar.Iv IN RELATION TO PROPERTY 87 
comprising a large household not only live to- 
gether, but have nearly all things in common. Each 
member works, not for himself, but for the house- 
hold, and all that he earns is expected to go into 
the family treasury. The arrangement almost in- 
evitably leads to one of two results—either there 
are continual dissensions, or order is preserved by 
a powerful domestic tyranny.’ It is quite natural, 
therefore, that when the authority of the landed 
proprietors was abolished in 1861, the large peasant 
families almost all crumbled to pieces. The arbitrary 
rule of the Khozain was based on, and maintained 
by, the arbitrary rule of the proprietor, and both 
naturally fell together. Households like that of 
our friend Ivan were preserved only in exceptional 
cases, when the Head of the House happened to 
possess an unusual amount of moral influence over 
the other members. 
“The change has unquestionably had a prejudicial 
influence on the material welfare of the peasantry, 
but it must have added considerably to their 
domestic comfort, and may perhaps produce good 
moral results. For the present, however, the evil 
consequences are by far the most prominent. Every 
married peasant strives to have a house of his own, 
and many of them, in order to defray the necessary 
expenses, have been obliged to incur debts.” ® 
1 For a different view of life in a large family, cf. Demolins in 
Les Frangais d'aujourd’hui, p. 12: “Du moment qu’on peut travailler 
et posséder en commun, on vit en commun, parcequ'il est plus 
facile, plus agréable et plus économique de rester réunis que de se 
séparer.”

    88 THE FAMILY PART I 
Again: “In the time of serfage the peasant families, 
as I have already remarked, were usually very large. 
They remained undivided, partly from the influence 
of patriarchal conceptions, but chiefly because the 
proprietors, recognising the advantage of large units, 
prevented them from breaking up. As soon as the 
proprietor’s authority was removed, the process of 
disintegration began, and spread rapidly. Every one 
wished to be independent, and in a very short time 
nearly every able-bodied married peasant had a house 
of his own. The economic consequences were dis- 
astrous. A large amount of money had to be expended 
in constructing new houses and farm steadings; and 
the old habit of one male member remaining at home 
to cultivate the land allotment with the female 
members of the family, whilst the others went to earn 
wages elsewhere, had to be abandoned. Many large 
families, which had been prosperous and comfortable 
—rich according to peasant conceptions—dissolved 
into three or four small ones, all on the brink of 
pauperism.” * 
Even if it should prove that in Russia the Patriarchal 
Family is doomed by the restriction of the people’s 
land and the weight of taxation, there are other 
countries where it still flourishes and preserves the 
ancient relation between the Family and its property. 
The following account of the Family community in 
Servia is quoted from the Report of the First 
International Co-operative Congress, 1895 :— 
1 Russia, vol. ii, p. 221.
-P-A-G-E-95
  cuar.Iv IN RELATION TO PROPERTY 89 
“ First comes our Zadrouga, or family community, 
which greatly resembles the Sociedade familias of 
Portugal, or the Compania gallegas of Spain. It is 
really that ancient type, the rural family founded 
upon relationship or adoption, and having for its aim 
a community of life and property. The zadrouga is a 
big family, whose members (brothers, cousins, or more 
distant relatives, with their wives and children) are 
united by bonds of relationship, marriage, and adop- 
tion. The management of the community is confided 
to the oldest member, who is considered the head of 
the family, and all the others owe him respect and 
obedience. His authority is extensive, but consti- 
tutional and fatherly. He derives his authority from 
the love springing from blood relationship, from 
gratitude for his fatherly care, and from the respect 
due to old age and experience. In exceptional cases, 
when the oldest member is a spendthrift, idle and 
incapable, so that he is ruining the community—a 
case which is of very rare occurrence—the ancient 
customs are departed from, and all the members of 
the zadrouga together choose their head chief from 
among themselves. 
“All the property of the zadrouga belongs in 
common to all its members of both sexes, so long as 
they remain in the community. The head cannot 
dispose of the patrimony of the community without 
the consent of its members. This state of things has 
been preserved also by the Servian civil code, compiled 
in 1844, which contains an interesting chapter upon 
zadrougas (v. articles 507 to 530).  
-P-A-G-E-96
    90 THE FAMILY | PART I 
| 
“The zadrouga engages in all kinds of work—it is 
a sort of association for production and for distribution 
in one. Only those things are brought from outside 
which the community is unable to produce, such as 
iron implements, machines, certain utensils, and that 
is almost all. Everything else is produced by the 
community—provisions, clothing, boots and shoes, 
bedding, wooden utensils, outbuildings and dwellings, 
etc. Each member of the community has to perform 
the work appointed him. The whole community delib- 
erates on its operations—all assembled together, men, 
women, and even the paid servants, if there are any. 
“Tt is individual capacity, age and sex, which 
determine the work of each one. The children, or if 
there are none, the women (those who are not strong 
enough for heavy work) tend the flocks. Work in 
the fields and vineyards is executed by members of 
both sexes indifferently, but the men alone, as being 
the strongest, plough, dig, mow, and cut wood, whilst 
the women generally look after the house-work, the 
making of clothes, and other indoor work. The men 
also attend to the sale of produce. 
“The head of the zadrouga represents the com- 
munity in its relations with the state or the parish. 
The distribution of labour depends on the season, the 
amount of work to be done, and the number of workers. 
For it to be well arranged, good sense, honesty, and 
especially justice, suffice. In general, the part played 
by the head of the community is of less importance 
from an economic point of view than from that of his 
moral authority.
-P-A-G-E-97
cuar.iv IN RELATION TO PROPERTY 91 
“The zadrouga had its origin in the most remote 
past of the Slav people. They lived grouped in 
families, which composed the villages, and collective 
property belonging to the whole group alone was 
known. They worked in common the soil which they 
owned in common. 
“The common ownership of the zadrouga rests on 
the same principle as the ownership of parish property. 
In each family community the soil and all the movable 
things, consisting of instruments of labour, such as 
ploughs, cattle, carts, etc., belong to all in common. 
No member of the community can encumber the 
common property, and still less mortgage it or alienate 
it, or even his own share of it. If a member leaves 
the community he loses all his rights of co-proprietor- 
ship in it, and in order to re-acquire them he must 
re-enter the community. This provision is very 
logical, for a member who leaves a community to 
establish himself on his own account ceases from that 
moment to be productive for the community. The 
consent of all the members is required to encumber or 
alienate the property of the community, or dispose of 
it in any way. When a community becomes too 
numerous, or some other reason arises, it may be 
divided, subject to several conditions, the principal 
one being the consent of all those interested who are 
of full age, and then, but then only, each member 
becomes owner of the share falling to his due. 
“All income and individual acquisitions are paid 
into the common fund, and all the members are co- 
proprietors equally, and have the same rights of  
-P-A-G-E-98
  92 THE FAMILY PART I 
enjoyment. Each one has his share in the general 
income, and this share is allotted according to neces- 
sities, and not according to individual efforts. When 
a member marries, it is the community which bears 
all the wedding expenses. 
“Should a community be divided, the landed 
property is shared amongst the men; the women do 
not share in the division. In the Servian rural family 
the female sex is subordinate to the male, a fact 
specially noticeable when a division takes place. 
When a young woman marries she only receives gifts 
and presents from the movable property. What she 
brings as a dowry is not considered common property ; 
the idea of common property is opposed to it. Such 
is the organisation of the Servian Zadrouga, which 
had, and still has, great influence on the economic 
development of Servia.” 
It is interesting to note here that Stepniak con- 
siders that in Russia the Patriarchal Family as an 
industrial unit will be replaced by voluntary co- 
operation amongst adults for the purpose of carrying 
out any piece of work: “There exists no people .. . 
who, as a body, are so well trained for collective 
labour as our moujiks are. Whenever a group or a 
crowd of them have some common economical interest 
to look after, or some common work to perform, they 
invariably form themselves into an artel, or kind of 
trades union, which is a free, purely economical mir, 
purged of the compulsory despotic elements of political 
authority. It is a free union of people who combine 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
cuar.Iv IN RELATION TO PROPERTY 93 
for the mutual advantages of co-operation in labour, or 
consumption, or of both. Itsmembership is voluntary, 
not imposed, and each member is free to withdraw at 
the close of the season, or upon the conclusion of the 
particular work for which the artel was formed, and 
to enter into a new artel. Quarrels between members, 
as well as offences against the aréel, if not settled in 
an amicable manner, have to be brought before the 
common tribunals. The artel has no legal authority 
over its members. Expulsion from the artel is the 
only punishment, or rather the only protection, these 
associations possess against those who break their 
rules. Yet the artels do very well, and in permanent 
work often prove to be life-long partnerships. ... . 
The principle of co-operation is applied as frequently 
and naturally to agricultural as to non-agricultural 
work. Of late years co-operation in agriculture has 
become even more varied and more extensive than 
ever before, partly because of the impoverishment of 
the people, and especially because of the wholesale 
breaking-down throughout Russia of the big patriarchal 
families. So long as they existed they formed com- 
pulsory co-operative associations, and were held 
together by family despotism. Now they are sup- 
planted by free associations or self-electing artels,” ! 
It seems probable that Stepniak has here over- 
rated the importance of the artel as a factor in 
Russian industry. According to later authorities, 
these associations are as yet of comparatively small

-P-A-G-E-100
94 THE FAMILY PART I 
importance, are formed only for temporary purposes, 
and are applicable only to agricultural operations of 
the simplest nature, such as tree-felling. But even if 
it were decisively shown that the Patriarchal Family 
could profitably be replaced by other organisations 
for the purpose of carrying on any given piece of 
work, there remains the further question as to the 
extent to which such organisations can provide for all 
members of the community, and as to the value of 
the type of human being actually produced by it. 
The long discipline and close co-operation essential to 
the common life in large family groups cannot fail to 
have a very marked effect upon the character of those 
who share that life ; and this is a consideration at least 
as important as that of its relation to economic pro- 
duction. Indeed, the two questions are inextricably 
mixed up together, for economic production depends 
quite as much upon individual efficiency as upon 
organisation, and individual efficiency is almost entirely 
a question of individual training and character. There 
can be little doubt that the present capacity of the 
Russians to form themselves into bodies of co-operative 
producers is derived from their long discipline in 
family life; they and their ancestors from time im- 
memorial have learned to subordinate their particular 
interests and to work together for the common good. 
But one point which strikes us at once is this: that 
whereas the family group, settled upon its own land 
which affords a variety of work suited to all capacities, 
includes weakly and inefficient members who yield 
what services they can, and are partly provided for 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  cuar.Iv IN RELATION TO PROPERTY 95 
by the strong, the new and voluntary industrial 
group will include none but the efficient and able- 
bodied, while the weakly will tend to fall out alto- 
gether. 
It was more from this point of view of character 
and mutual support—what we may perhaps call the 
social point of view—that Le Play carried on his 
studies of family life in various parts of Europe and 
under various conditions. The main part of his 
writing centres round the middle of last century, 
though his observations had extended over many 
years previously. He was led to this particular 
branch of investigation by his keen desire to find 
some remedy for the distressed restlessness of the 
French people which he saw around him. To find a 
remedy he knew that one must seek a cause; and to 
him it was clear that the cause was only to be found 
by penetrating deeply into the lives of the people 
themselves. Hence his prolonged studies of typical 
Families in many widely separated districts of Europe, 
covering their social and physical surroundings, their 
degree of material prosperity, their way of work and 
life, and the customs or laws regulating family rela- 
tions. His long years of labour left him firmly 
convinced that one essential factor in the prosperity 
and content of a people is a good organisation of the 
Family; and the greater part of his voluminous 
writings is devoted to recording observations as to 
the effect upon family life of such things as the laws 
of bequest and inheritance in France, the laws against 
early marriages in Germany, the Calvinistic religion
-P-A-G-E-102
  96 THE FAMILY PART I 
in Geneva, the organisation of industry in England, 
and so on. 
What is a good organisation of the Family? I 
have already mentioned the three types noted by 
Le Play, and illustrated by him in his monographs. 
There is first the Patriarchal Family which we have 
been considering ; this is essentially Kastern in char- 
acter, it is ruled by tradition and averse to all change. 
Next to this, and approximating to it in many of its 
characteristics, is the famille-souche, of which I shall 
speak next; the main characteristics of it are that 
it is attached to its home, but combines fidelity to 
tradition with a considerable capacity for change. 
In its typical form continuity is secured by one of 
the children becoming definitely heir to the father’s 
possessions and authority, while the others leave home 
to seek their fortunes, provided with a dower. But 
the essential features are the authority and continuity 
which secure the welfare of all the members of the 
Family. 
Finally, there is the unstable Family, of which the 
members care little for home, and are eager only for 
change. It is formed by the marriage of the parents, 
increased by the birth of the children, diminishes 
again as these leave home, and is finally dissolved 
by the death of the parents. There is no continuity 
or authority, and little, if any, assurance of the well- 
being of its various members. These unstable Families 
Le Play finds in all the poorest and most distressed 
regions which he visits ; each generation as it reaches 
economic independence breaks away from the preceding
-P-A-G-E-103
cHaP.Iv IN RELATION TO PROPERTY 97 
one, and each member of a generation from its fellow- 
members ; the father has little or no authority, and the 
children drift out into the world undisciplined and un- 
trained. Such Families neither secure the well-being of 
individuals nor contribute anything to the prosperity of 
the community. We are only too familiar with them 
to-day, and shall have more to say of them later on. 
They are indeed at the root of most of our social diffi- ° 
culties. They are like baskets with holes in them; 
they let the old people drop out at one end, and the 
children at the other, to be picked up by the State, 
or take their chance of passing charity. And not 
infrequently the basket falls to pieces altogether, and 
the whole Family has to be sorted out into work- 
houses, asylums, and prisons. 
But the Families of various degrees of stability are 
still infinitely more numerous all over the world, and 
the nature and source of their strength must be studied, 
before we can properly understand the causes of their 
change and failure. 
We have seen the admiration felt by Le Play for 
the Patriarchal Family of the East; much that he 
writes leads one to think that he considered the type 
of society founded upon it to be that which really 
conduced most to the happiness of the human race. 
But he recognised that without modification it was 
incompatible with the movement of the world which 
we know as progress; that it could neither stand 
before modern ideals of education and personal liberty, 
nor yet contribute its share towards the further sub- 
jugation of Nature in the interests of humanity ; and

he fixed upon the second form, that of the stable 
Family, or famille-souche, as combining the best 
features of the new and the old. The most charac- 
teristic form of this he finds amongst the French 
peasant proprietors of the older type. Here the 
family life centres round the homestead from genera- 
tion to generation, carrying with it not only the 
authority of the head of the Family, but also the 
weighty responsibility of providing for the welfare of 
the other members. Children are numerous, and each 
generation consists of from eight to ten members; 
those who marry or leave the home to seek their 
fortunes elsewhere are provided with a “ portion,” 
those who prefer it stay on in the old home, partaking 
in the work of the farm, and sharing the family 
fortunes for good or for evil. In such a home may 
be found brothers and sisters of three generations, 
submitting themselves to the authority of the chief, 
and forming under his guidance an independent in- 
dustrial community. The advantages of the system 
are enumerated by Le Play as follows. The children 
are brought up under the most favourable conditions, 
are carefully disciplined and educated, and are not 
expected to take any serious part in the work of the 
community until the age of fifteen. The family home 
secures a happy life to such of its members as from 
any physical or intellectual failing cannot prosper as 
heads of Families themselves ; it is an asylum always 
open to those who fail in their enterprises, especially 
for the invalided soldier. It secures an honourable 
position for aged relatives and other infirm members

of the communities. It is constantly sending out 
into the world offshoots trained to work and obedi- 
ence, and provided with a small capital, from whom 
recruits can be drawn for industry, for the army 
and navy, and for the colonies. And finally, the 
elders of the Family, practised in the difficult art 
of ruling a small community, form the best possible 
material for the institutions of local government. 
Thus the Family presents itself as the medium by 
which public interest is combined with private 
welfare. 
Without for the present expressing an opinion as 
to how far this famuille-souche is indispensable to 
social welfare, it is interesting to note in passing how 
many of our “social problems” of to-day are obviated 
by it, in so far as Le Play’s estimate is a correct one. 
Old age pensions are unnecessary where the stable 
Family combines young and old in one strong bond 
of mutual helpfulness. A proletariat residuum is 
impossible where all the young people who go out 
into the world are trained to habits of labour and 
obedience, as well as being strong and capable; the 
natural asylum of the home for the mentally and 
physically feeble is a far surer precaution against the 
marriage and propagation of the unfit than any re- 
cognised system of public control; while the firmly 
rooted belief that family life involves a home and 
property, however humble, prohibits the thriftless 
marriages which lead to pauperism. 
If now we ask what factors are essential to an 
effective Family of this type, we find that is based,

-P-A-G-E-106
100 THE FAMILY PART I 
according to Le Play, upon two in particular—suff- 
cient private property to ensure the occupation and 
maintenance of the Family, and the authority of the 
father, which enables him not only to handle the pro- 
perty so as to conduce to the best interests of the 
Family, but also to control and direct his children 
until they have learned to guide their own lives and 
are fitted to fulfil their duties. Now this authority, 
Le Play considers, can only be firmly established 
where the father has free control over the family 
property, not only during his lifetime, but at death 
also—where, that is, there is freedom of bequest. 
Only so can he ensure that the property will be 
maintained intact for the future support of the 
Family, and only so can he uphold his supremacy 
over his children through their fear of being dis- 
inherited. 
In this relation of the Family to its property we 
come upon one of the most important influences 
determining family life, acting both through internal 
custom and through the external intervention of the 
State. There is no point at which the State has so 
persistently and so effectively, for good or for evil, 
intervened in family matters as on this question of 
the transmission of property. Time and again legisla- 
tion has been passed, and annulled and repassed, in 
favour of equal partition, of freedom of bequest, of 
primogeniture, as one or the other system has been 
thought desirable, either in the interests of a parti- 
cular class, or in the interests of the nation as a whole. 
And wherever legislation has been so far effective as 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
cHaPr.tv IN RELATION TO PROPERTY 101 
to modify the custom of a people with respect to the 
inheritance of property, it has also left a deep and 
lasting mark upon the organisation and influence of 
the Family in other ways than that of inheritance 
itself.
-P-A-G-E-108
CHAPTER V 
THE FAMILY AND THE STATE 
Tue direct influence of the State upon the Family 
through its marriage laws is so simple, and changes 
so slowly, as to leave little to be said; but it has other 
less obvious ways of making its influence felt. In this 
chapter we are concerned with the indirect influence 
which it has exercised by legislation affecting the 
family property and its transmission from one genera- 
tion to another. 
Before proceeding to describe some of the more 
important interventions of the State in this respect, I 
will indicate an interesting feature about the theories 
upon which such interventions are sometimes hased. I 
have already pointed out that in one of the oldest con- 
ceptions of the Family known to us the property is 
considered as inalienable from it, and as belonging to 
the whole Family as such, the Head of the Family 
being merely the user for the time being. And not 
only is his use of it temporary, but in so far as it 
belongs to all members of the Family his use of it is 
not for his benefit alone, but for theirs also. This 
belief that the patrimony belongs to the Family is to 
be found amongst many peoples at many stages of 
102
-P-A-G-E-109
cHar.v THE FAMILY AND THE STATE 103 
development, and the modern French law of equal 
partition is explicitly based upon it. It is based, 
that is, upon the assumption that the father has no 
right to exclude any member of the Family from his 
due share in the family property, and that in the 
interests of justice the State must, if necessary, inter- 
vene to prevent his doing so. But the same view of the 
relation of the Family to its property may lead to an 
entirely opposite theory of inheritance. Le Play, for 
instance, pleaded keenly against the law of enforced 
partition, and in favour of freedom of bequest; but 
he based his plea not upon the crude dogma that 
“a man may do what he likes with his own,” but 
upon the ground that the father’s power to choose 
his successor is in the best interests of the Family as 
  a whole. And from the point of view of the choice- 
of the best successor to carry on the family business, 
there is no doubt that freedom of bequest comes far 
nearer to the old tradition of the Family and its 
property than does a compulsory partition. Primo-. 
geniture itself, in so far as it is merely customary, is 
due mainly to the fact that, other things being equal, 
the oldest son would also be the strongest and most 
experienced, and therefore the best fitted to manage 
the affairs of the Family. 
Now these two theories of the relation of the 
Family to its property run through the whole history 
of the people in relation to the land. On the one 
hand, we have the view that the interests of the 
Family are best served when its property is held and 
administered by the strongest member on behalf of L-  
-P-A-G-E-110
  
104 THE FAMILY PART 
the others; the view, that is, which considers the 
Family as a whole with inseparable interests. On 
the other hand, there is the view which holds that 
the interests of each member of the Family are largely 
independent of the interests of other members, and 
can only be properly safeguarded by a division of 
the family property, which puts his share under his 
separate and complete control. We find a similar 
antithesis in the different theories as to a nation and 
its property ; there are some who hold that it is well 
that the property of a people, and more especially its 
land, should rest in the hands of those who can best 
administer it in the interests of the whole people; 
while others maintain that this trust is certain to be 
abused, and that the only safeguard is a division 
which will give each individual the direct control 
over his own share, no matter whether he is com- 
petent to administer it or not. 
With the wider question, which to some extent 
’ coincides with the question of aristocracy v. demo- 
cracy, we are not directly concerned here, though, as 
we shall see, it has been largely influential in deter- 
mining the attitude of the State in various countries 
towards questions of family organisation and inherit- 
ance. But in reference to the no less important rela- 
tion of the Family to its property, it must be noted 
that neither view can claim to meet all the needs of 
the case, nor to ensure the welfare of all members of the 
Family. On the one hand, not only must there be 
taken into account the innumerable cases in which 
the “‘ Head of the Family” thinks more of his rights
-P-A-G-E-111
  CHAP. V AND THE STATE 105 
than his responsibilities, and becomes a petty tyrant ;+ 
but also it must be borne in mind in how many times 
and places the view that the family property must 
be administered by one in the interests of all, has 
degenerated into the commonplace view of Primo- 
geniture that the property belongs to one alone, and 
is to be administered by him purely in his own in- 
terest—a degeneration which may give rise to a 
proletariat class, a people without property, as surely 
as the opposite view. For, on the other hand, and 
as we have noted already, under a theory which 
regards the different members of a Family as having 
hostile interests, and accepts “division” as the only 
means of securing justice, it is inevitable that some 
at least of the weakly and incompetent will succumb 
in the struggle; that they will prove unequal to the 
task of administering their “share,” and that here 
again we shall get a helplessly poverty-stricken class 
perpetuating itself in the community. 
One more point remains to be noted before passing 
to actual history. In speaking of primogeniture and 
equal division of property amongst the children, it 
must be borne in mind that we are not dealing wit 
two simple and opposed systems, but that either form 
of inheritance may be encouraged, or the reverse, by 
the State and by custom in very various degrees, 
There may be absolute freedom of bequest so far as 
the law is concerned, in which case it will be mainly 
a matter of local custom what system prevails. It 
may be the eldest son who is preferred, or it may be 
1 See Stepniak as quoted above, p. 84.
-P-A-G-E-112
    106 THE FAMILY PART I 
the youngest, or it may be the eldest daughter ; or, 
again, it may be that the system of equal division 
is customary. Finally, it may be the very frequent 
compromise by which the property devolves upon 
the eldest son as representative of the other members 
of the Family. 
When the State does intervene, the mildest form 
of intervention is in the case of intestacy, 7.e. where 
the father dies without a formal and recognised state- 
ment of his will. Then the law may prescribe either 
that the whole or principal share falls to the eldest 
son, or that the property is divided, according to which 
theory of inheritance is upheld by the State. At 
first sight the amount of interference involved in this 
may seem to be insignificant and not likely to have 
any effect upon the actual course of inheritance, for 
if the passing owner does not acquiesce in the ruling 
of the law, he has only to make a will in order to 
avoid it. But in reality such a law proves to have 
very considerable influence upon the actual course of 
inheritance, and legislators are able to rely with some 
confidence upon it as an instrument for bringing 
about the state of things they desire. There are two 
main reasons for this. In the first place, where 
custom is strong, as in most agricultural countries, 
the disinclination to make a will is often strong also ; 
and the expectation that the property will continue 
to descend in the Family in the same way as for 
countless generations takes long to break down, even 
in the face of contrary legislation. And in the 
second place, where custom is weaker, the action of 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
    CHAP. V AND THE STATE 107 
those who do make wills can hardly fail to be affected 
by the attitude of the State. If the law assigns the 
property to the eldest son, then to make a will 
depriving him of his pre-eminence is so far a slight 
upon him and an injury to his expectations; while if 
the law prescribes equal division, then to leave the 
property to one is to incur the blame of showing 
favouritism towards one at the expense of the others. 
In short, whichever course the State favours, it 
emphasises the aspect of injustice involved in the 
other course, and so exerts a steady pressure in the 
desired direction. 
But the State may go much further in its inter- 
vention than by merely distributing the property of 
the man who has made no will. It may limit hi 
freedom of bequest to any extent and in a 
direction, from enacting that the property must go to 
the eldest son, as in feudal times, to insisting upon 
division, as in France of to-day. And if now we 
turn to consider the actual history of a few such 
instances of intervention, we shall do well to begin 
with France, for the French peasant-proprietor, in his 
relation to the land, has long been held up as an 
object -lesson to social students. The story as 
generally told and accepted has been subject to 
revision of late years, but in its familiar form it 
runs somewhat as follows: Before the French 
Revolution custom and law had encouraged a system 
of inheritance under which estates, both large and 
small, tended to be preserved intact and were passed 
on from generation to generation in the same  
-P-A-G-E-114
  108 THE FAMILY PART I 
Families. Amongst the noble or wealthy this was 
effected by a system of primogeniture and entail ; 
amongst the smaller proprietors by the custom of the 
famille-souche, as described above. This state of 
affairs was reversed after the Revolution by the 
laws enforcing a partition of the family property 
amongst all the children of the Family. The evil 
results of this are stated to have been twofold; on 
the one hand, the over-division of the land (morcelle- 
ment) into portions too small to afford a subsistence to 
the owners, leading to a poverty-stricken peasantry and 
a retrograde state of agriculture ; on the other hand, 
and in order to avoid the first evil, the deliberate 
limitation of the peasant-family which has led to 
the stationary condition of the French population. 
This view has been subjected to searching criticism 
by Lujo Brentano in his book on Hrbrechtspolitih. 
His two main contentions are, in the first place, that 
the new laws merely confirmed a procedure which 
was previously customary amongst by far the greater 
part of the people, and, in the second place, that the 
evil results so freely predicted and asserted are not 
borne out by the facts. 
What was the actual state of affairs before the 
Revolution? So far as legislation was concerned we 
find a law of intestacy which distinguishes between 
two kinds of property, noble and not noble, and 
prescribes that noble land shall descend by primo- 
geniture to the eldest son, while not noble land is 
subject at the death of the owner to equal division 
Brentano estimates that three-quarters of the land in
-P-A-G-E-115
CHAP. V AND THE STATE 109 
France was thus already subject to equal division, 
and only one quarter to primogeniture. 
This does not of course imply that inheritance 
actually took place in these proportions. The law 
applying only in case of intestacy, freedom of bequest 
remained intact and was exercised mainly in accord- 
ance with local customs. These customs varied 
greatly in different parts of the country. In the 
South of France the preference of the eldest born was 
common ; but for the most part the preference was 
probably of the kind so strongly advocated by Le 
Play, which made the heir the representative of the 
Family acting in its interests, rather than the prefer- 
ence of primogeniture.’ 
In the middle and northern provinces many and 
various customs were in force, which differed for 
noble and non-noble estates, for movable and 
immovable property, for inherited and acquired 
property. But behind all the different customs was 
the law of intestacy exerting a steady pressure in 
favour of equal division of the greater part of the 
land; so that the French people were thoroughly 
habituated to the idea, if not to the practice, long 
before the change which followed upon the Revolution. 
The preference of the eldest-born as a matter of 
custom differs of course essentially from the right of 
the eldest-born, which constitutes primogeniture in 
the fullest sense, and as it was embodied in the feudal 
system. But both as customary and as legal it has 
behind it a long history of policy and statecraft ; 
1 Brentano, Erbrechtspolitik, pp. 2 sq.
-P-A-G-E-116
110 THE FAMILY PART I 
a history which is essentially a history of the Family 
in its relation to the State. The desire of States to 
strengthen themselves by founding great Families, 
and then to break down the overweening power of 
the great Families they have fostered, has led in 
most countries at one time or another to legislative 
interference with family customs; while the counter 
desire of the great Families to maintain their strength 
against attacks by the State has been one of the 
most fruitful sources of devices for keeping the 
Family and its property intact. 
The most striking, and probably the first, utilisa- 
tion of a compulsory system of Primogeniture to 
strengthen the State, was when it was introduced 
into England by the Normans in connection with the 
feudal system. ‘“‘ Before that time Primogeniture was 
unknown to the English, as to other German peoples ; 
but the need of a strong organisation against the 
conquered Saxons led the King to assign the feudal 
lands in such a way that they could only be inherited 
undivided. As the Family receiving the fief was 
represented by its eldest member, he was delegated 
by the Family to take it over; and out of this 
function of the eldest as principal administrator of | 
the family estate there grew up an exclusive right, 
that of primogeniture. Thus inheritance by Primo- 
geniture came from Normandy to England, was 
further developed upon English soil, then reacted 
upon France, until it became the regular system 
.peculiar to feudal property.” * 
1 Brentano, p. 4.
-P-A-G-E-117
CHAP. V AND THE STATE 111 
It was in this way that the sovereigns gathered 
around them a body of wealthy and noble Families, 
eager to preserve the existing order, and able by 
their wealth and strength to provide fighting men 
and money in time of war. And for the Families 
themselves, especially in a hostile land, a system 
which preserved the property intact under the firm 
tule of the eldest born, was probably the strongest 
form of organisation. 
Then came the time when the great Families 
became too strong for the safety of the monarchs, 
and the aim of the latter became to break down 
by executions and confiscations the power of the 
organisation which they had built up. To meet 
this danger the Families strengthened themselves still 
further by using the devices of “ fideicommissae” 
and entails. The sovereign might indeed execute 
the head of the family if he could get hold of him, 
but could not confiscate his property if it had only 
been held by him in trust for future generations. 
And while the property remained in the hands of the 
Family, its power would be at best but checked for. 
one generation by the loss of its chief. 
The history of these devices for keeping the con- 
nection between the Family and its property un- 
broken, for guarding it in times of civil strife against 
confiscation, and in more modern times against the 
wastefulness of any particular representative, is a 
long and complicated one. Curiously enough, though 
in their later developments they have operated entirely 
to the exclusion of female heirs, they seem to have
-P-A-G-E-118
  112 THE FAMILY PART I 
had their origin in attempts to frustrate the Roman 
law against inheritance by women. A testator de- 
sirous of leaving his property to a woman, and 
prevented by the Roman law from doing so directly, 
would attain his end by making a will nominally 
in favour of some person capable of inheriting, who 
then became in the eyes of the law the only heir and 
proprietor. But a request would be added to the 
will that the nominal heir (fiduciarius) should 
transfer the property to the person who was in- 
capable of inheriting direct (fideicommissarius). 
Sometimes the heir would fulfil the trust, some- 
times not; and abuses of trust in time became 
frequent to such an extent that the law was gradu- 
ally brought, first to recognise the trusts and then 
to protect them. 
Sometimes the property would be left to the 
fiduciary heir for life, under condition of passing it 
on to a certain specified person or persons at his 
death; and it was this form of trust, known as 
“substitution,” which the French people utilised to 
create perpetual entails." Combining the system 
with that of primogeniture, the founder of such an 
entail would leave his property to the eldest male 
of all future generations. ‘The nobles, who were in 
constant danger of trial for high treason, made use of 
fideicommissae, to preserve at least their property 
to their family in case they should be condemned. 
But it was just this security against confiscation 
which made the crown see in the fideicommissae a 
1 Brentano, p. 12.
-P-A-G-E-119
  CHAP. V AND THE STATE 113 
check to the royal power.”* Hence at the rise of 
the absolute monarchy we find the Crown resolutely 
opposing them, and finally legislating against their 
permanency. In France the validity of such entails 
was limited in 1560 to two generations. 
When the power of the Crown was firmly estab- 
lished its attitude changed again, and it once more 
encouraged the great Families, which by their wealth 
and magnificence added so much to the splendour of 
the Court. Then the desire to “ found Families” by 
means of entails seems to have spread through all 
classes of society ; for in 1629 it was found necessary 
to prohibit them to personnes rustiques, a term 
afterwards interpreted to mean peasant proprietors 
and agricultural labourers, but not tradespeople nor 
artisans in the towns. 
Then came the time when it was evident that the 
Jideicommissae were becoming the occasion of great 
social evils. In the eighteenth century not only did 
their excessive multiplication give rise to incessant 
litigation; but it often happened that the very 
families for whose preservation they had been insti- 
tuted were ruined by the inability of the life-owner 
to deal freely with the land. Thus the time was ripe 
for their abolition; a process which began with the 
Revolution and terminated in the Code Civil. 
The principle of the Code Civil is the free divisi- 
bility of land by the living as well as at death. The 
possessor is free to buy or sell as he likes, and if he 
has no descendants he can dispose of his property 
1 Brentano, p. 12. 
LE
-P-A-G-E-120
114 THE FAMILY PART I 
freely by will. If he has descendants, then in the 
case of intestacy the law ensures absolutely equal 
division between all the children, male and female ; 
but if the possessor choose to make a will, then he 
may dispose freely of a part only of the property, the 
rest must be divided amongst the members of the 
family. This free part varies in amount with the 
number of children: if he has only one child, then 
that child must inherit half, and the father may leave 
the other half as he will; if he has two children, then 
he may dispose freely of one-third; if three or more 
children, then of one-fourth only. Thus if he wishes 
to “make an eldest son,” he can do it only to the 
limited extent of adding the free share to the portion 
of the eldest son. From this point of view, therefore, 
the Revolution was the victory of the “ younger 
sons”; and it is a strange paradox that their victory 
has largely resulted in making a nation of “ only sons,” 
with all the weakening privileges and none of the 
strengthening responsibilities of the true “eldest 
son.” 
In these provisions of the Code Civil as to inherit- 
ance Brentano finds a recognition of the true relation 
of the Family to its property: “like the ancient law, 
the Code regards children and grandchildren as 
persons who, even during the life of the testator, are 
quast co-proprietors of his possessions... . It is 
based upon the fundamental idea that the inherit- 
ance is family property, and therefore no member 
must be deprived of his full share . . . hence its 
careful exclusion of primogeniture, 7.e. the robbing
-P-A-G-E-121
CHAP. V AND THE STATE 115 
of the majority of the Family for the benefit of 
one.” + 
Against Montesquieu’s argument that children 
have no natural right to succeed to the property 
of their father, who is absolute owner, he replies :? 
“But originally the father was never this. The 
original economic unit was never the individual, but 
the house: the father was only the director and 
representative of the community, while even during 
his lifetime the children, or at least the sons, were 
co-proprietors in the property of the household, the 
Family. Greek custom regarded the house - father 
only as the natural guardian and administrator of 
the common property, and the succession of heirs 
amongst the Romans is described by the jurist 
Paulus as not strictly inheritance, but as a develop- 
ent of their relation to the property ; by succession 
hey only received the free control over that which 
hey already possessed as co-proprietors during the 
ather’s life. But in France it was not only in the 
eginning, as everywhere else, that Families were the 
conomic units. Troplong writes of the Middle 
ges: ‘The association of all members of the Family 
nder one roof, upon one property, for the purpose 
f common work and common gain, is the universal 
haracteristic phenomenon from the South of France 
0 its furthest ends.’ ” 
As a justification of the rights of all members of 
he Family to partake in the use of the property this 
ppeal to the past is forcible. But it does not seem 
1 Erbrechtspolitik, p. 18. ® Ibid. p. 81.
-P-A-G-E-122
116 THE FAMILY PART 1 
to afford any argument in support of the division of 
that property, and its appropriation to individuals. 
On the contrary, the relation between the Family as 
a unit and the property which it holds in common is 
even more completely shattered by its distribution 
amongst its several members than by its appropriation 
by one member only. 
The new law of inheritance was generally regarded 
in France as one of the most emphatic signs of the 
triumph of republican over monarchical principles. 
In Napoleon’s hands, however, it was no question of 
principle, but part of a deliberate policy designed to 
break down effectually the power of the great Families 
who would be likely to oppose his progress. Thus it 
was no change in principle, but a mere continuation 
of the same policy of self-aggrandisement which led him 
between 1808-12 to re-institute hereditary titles and 
estates which should descend by primogeniture under 
the new name of “majorats.” Asa monarch he felt 
the necessity of strengthening his position by creating 
great Families whose interests should be identical with! 
his own, and no fear of inconsistency withheld him. 
By 1830 no less than 440 entails had been thu 
created." 
The same device for breaking down the powe 
of the great Families was used by the Tzars i 
Russia when they introduced the equal division o: 
both titles and estates; and by the English states 
men when they enforced equal division upon th 
great Catholic families in Ireland, while permittin; 
1 Cecil, Primogeniture.
-P-A-G-E-123
CHAP. V AND THE STATE 117 
primogeniture to continue amongst the Protestants 
(1703). 
The importance of the Family in the statesman’s 
eyes as a political instrument was once more 
emphasised when the Bourbons returned with the 
emigrant aristocrats. For a time the King held the 
balance between noble and citizen; but with the 
accession ;of the Comte d’Artois, the aristocratic 
principle received the support of the Crown, and the 
struggle to reintroduce the ancien régime began— 
a struggle which was largely for the re-introduction 
of privileged Families, of primogeniture and feudalism 
against younger sons and the bourgeoisie. 
The first reactionary proposal in 1828 was to make 
“majorats” legal for every one. This was not, it 
as said, to impose upon the people a new privileged 
lass, but rather to make it competent for every one 
o enter a privileged class. Moreover, it was urged, 
he land had now been subdivided as far as it could 
e done with profit; landed proprietors were getting 
oorer and more numerous, while the bourgeoisie was 
etting richer and more powerful. The time had 
ome to check the division of property, and this must 
e done by the creation of indivisible estates, which 
hould confer electoral rights upon the owners and be 
inherited by primogeniture. The proposal was re- 
erred without discussion to a commission which never 
eported. It was renewed next year with no more 
uccess, but one of the arguments then brought for- 
ard to support it is full of interest from the point of 
iew of our modern urban problems. Small holdings,
-P-A-G-E-124
  118 THE FAMILY PART I 
it was urged, were a pest. It was due to them 
that out of the thirty millions of the French popu- 
lation, twenty-four millions inhabited the country. 
The depopulated towns sought in vain for consumers 
of their products, the small owners in the country 
were in no position to purchase, for their only industry 
consisted in consuming what they produced.’ 
In 1826 an attempt was made to approach the 
desired end by another way. The Code Civil had 
left it open to fathers to dispose freely of a certain 
specified fraction of their property. It was now 
suggested that when the father failed to dispose of this 
fraction it should go by law to the eldest son, and 
that it might be entailed upon two successive persons. 
This proposal was supported quite frankly upon 
political grounds. A monarchy, it was said, must be 
strengthened and supported by a monarchical spirit 
amongst the people, and this could only be attained by 
founding the monarchy upon the Family instead of 
upon the individual. For the essence and aim of a 
monarchy is permanence, and this permanence the 
physical existence of the individual is too brief to 
ensure. It can only be based upon Families whic: 
include future as well as present generations. I, 
Democracy the particular man, the man of a day, i 
the unit; but in a Monarchy it is the Family, th 
being which does not and will not change. Hence 
the task of a monarchy is to found Families, and thi: 
can only be done by checking the division of lande 
property. The concentration of land in the hands o

  CHAP. V AND THE STATE 119 
one creates men who have an interest in maintaining 
the existing order; it upholds the Family in the 
social position to which it has attained ; it institutes 
a monarchical arrangement in the Family itself; and 
thus it creates a people with a spirit in harmony with 
that of the monarchy. 
It was, says Brentano, a reactionary attack upon 
equality in the very heart of the Family. “Der 
skandal war enorm” ; it echoed throughout the whole 
of France, and petitions rained upon both Houses. 
All were against the proposal with few exceptions, 
and even these few begged that the new law should 
be supplemented by the erection, at the cost of the 
State, of cloisters and asylums for the younger sons 
and daughters, thus showing their appreciation of the 
consequences involved. 
Notwithstanding the opposition of public feeling, 
the Ministry persisted in pressing the Bill. The first 
clause, attempting to reintroduce primogeniture ab 
intestato was rejected, and Paris was illuminated. 
The clause introducing entails was passed by both 
Chambers ; but ministry and monarchy survived its 
success but a short time, and by 1849 “ majorats,” 
“ substitutions,’ and entails of all kinds had been 
completely abolished, and the provisions of the Code 
Civil triumphantly vindicated. 
Equal division of property at the death of the 
father amongst his children (with the noted exception 
of a given fraction) is thus enforced by law in France 
of to-day. Can it be said that this provision really 
carries out in practice the theory that the property 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  120 THE FAMILY PART I 
belongs to the Family and not to the individual ? 
In some respects it would seem to do just the con- 
trary, and to aim rather at enforcing the claim of the 
individual as against the Family. During his life- 
time there is no restriction upon the power of the 
owner in dealing with his property; and when the 
time comes for dividing the inheritance the claims of 
individual members may be enforced in ways most 
injurious to the interests of the Family as a whole. 
Indeed, it may almost be said that the Family as a 
whole ceases to exist as soon as any question of in- 
heritance comes into play. Any one of the co-heirs 
may insist on the property being divided in such a 
way as to reduce its value greatly—e.g. by breaking 
up the land,—and the father has not even the power 
to prescribe such a division as may give a fair share 
to each without injuring the actual value of any part. 
With regard to the actual working of the practice, 
Brentano maintains that it has been mainly, if not 
entirely, beneficial. He argues that the fall in the 
birth-rate cannot be due to the compulsory division of 
property, inasmuch as in Belgium, where the same 
law of inheritance prevails, and the land is still more 
subdivided, the population increases rapidly. More- 
over, the small proprietor is already too low in the 
social scale to be deterred from increasing his family 
by the fear that his children will fall lower ; and it is 
actually in those districts where the smallest peasant 
proprietorship prevails that there is still an increasing 
population.’ 
1 Brentano, p. 138,
-P-A-G-E-127
/ CHAP. V AND THE STATE 121 
Further, “it is not the case that equal division of 
the property of the testator generally leads to the ruin 
of all the children. It may happen now and again. 
. . . But the rule is that the small inheritance left 
to each child forms the starting point from which he, 
like his father, works his way up by an industrious 
life to economic independence, and which enables him 
also to bring up his children in such a way as to be 
able in their turn to carry on the struggle for existence 
even without a large inheritance. In this way, as 
we see from the example of the French rural popula- 
tions, they form the best anchor for the stability of 
Society and the State. The important thing is, not 
to have a few people, sleepy possessors of inherited 
estates, exalting themselves above their brothers who 
are thrust out at the death of their father into the 
proletariat, . . . but to give to all the possibility of 
achieving freedom and life.” * 
In short, it is the equality of the “ younger 
brother” which is at stake, and the best means of 
securing to him as good a life as that of the first-born ; 
a problem which has troubled Europe for centuries, 
and led to many curious theories and arguments and 
hardly less curious practical results. 
One thing seems clear, that the problem is not 
really solved if the solution merely takes the form of 
reducing all alike to a state of poverty, and this is 
what the opponents of equal division maintain. The 
position in France seems to require far more detailed 
1 Brentano, p, 142.
-P-A-G-E-128
122 THE FAMILY PART I 
study than it has yet received before Brentano’s con- 
clusion can either be maintained or refuted. Such a 
study has been initiated by M. Demolins and his 
school, and passages such as the following seem to 
throw a different light upon the situation. He is 
discussing the influence of the vine upon its cultiva- 
tors: “No other form of culture can support so 
numerous a population upon so small a space. We 
need only look for proof to the ile de Ré, where the 
population is as dense as that ot the département du 
Nord. The attraction’ of the vine over the young 
people serves to keep them at home quarrelling over 
bits of land, rather than seek their fortune elsewhere. 
They are the more easily able to make a small living 
for themselves, because, under the régime of the un- 
stable family, the birth-rate is generally lowered, 
through fear of further division of properties already 
so tiny. Hence there is no need to move away, and 
no one thinks of doing so.” * 
But even Brentano himself confesses the superi- 
ority of a “ family partnership,” which, in its results 
at least, strongly resembles the famille - souche. 
“Equal division by itself is certainly not the ideal 
corresponding to the circumstances and needs of the 
day. We must strive to complete it by a co-operative 
association of the heirs for the purpose of carrying on 
the inherited business, such as I have found amongst 
certain advanced Families in Italy. Such a co-opera- 
tive business, based upon blood-relationship, maintains 
1 Demolins, Les Frangais d'aujowrd’ hut, p. 146,
-P-A-G-E-129
  CHAP. V AND THE STATE 123 
the equal right of all the heirs, secures to the Family 
and the property whatever business capital it pos- 
sesses, provides in the members of the Family the 
labour necessary for carrying on the business, and 
thus renews deliberately and upon a common basis 
the old household community, the ancient Family, so 
much lauded by Le Play.”* 
/The writer then cites several instances of such co- 
oferative households amongst Italians, of which the 
most remarkable is one which he came across in 
Cortina in 1892. The landlord of the hotel in which 
he was staying belonged to a Family which formed a 
household community modernised to suit modern 
conditions. Next to the hotel stood a farm-house, 
the ancestral home of the Family, and there lived an 
unmarried sister, who cultivated the family land. 
One brother was a smith, another a carpenter, a 
third a baker and confectioner ; the first two lived in 
their workshops, while the baker had his workshops 
and dwelling on the ground floor of a dépendance of 
the hotel. Another brother was a military doctor, 
and another Genieoffizier, both married, and living 
one in Trient and the other in Trieste. All six 
brothers and the sister lived in economic community, 
having one purse and sharing income and expenditure. 
It was from this common purse that the hotel, and 
later its dépendance, were built ; both being managed 
by the head of the Family. The rooms of the hotel had 
been fitted by the carpenter and smith, and the farm 
and the baker supplied a great part of the provisions. 
1 Brentano, p. 143.
-P-A-G-E-130
124 THE FAMILY PART I 
The two brothers in Trieste and Trient contributed 
nothing to the common purse, “because military 
doctors and officers have nothing to spare,” but they 
were regarded as having a full share in the family 
property. 
France, then, has adopted a definite and determined 
policy in reference to the relation between the Family 
and its Property. The State takes the view that the 
property belongs to the individual members of the 
Family as individuals, and enforces the right of the 
individual against the Family as a community. In 
so far, then, as the law prevails, if the family tie 
continues to be strong in France, it will not be be- 
cause the members are held together by their common 
relation to material property, but rather in despite 
of their power to cut themselves adrift from each 
other, each with his own share in his hand. From 
one point of view it is difficult not to regard this as a 
great source of weakness ; it is as if a number of men 
supported by the same rope should each claim his 
right to the part he holds, and enforce his absolute 
possession by cutting it above and below. From 
another point of view it can no doubt be represented 
as a source of strength; if several men are starving 
upon an insufficient patrimony, it is well that they 
should take each his share and seek new fields. 
But besides the question whether the policy is in 
the real interests of the people, there is the further 
question of how far the State has been able to enforce 
the policy. As a matter of fact, it seems clear that
-P-A-G-E-131
CHAP. V AND THE STATE 125 
not even the power of the State has been able to 
break down the old custom in parts of the country 
where the family feeling is strong in favour of pre- 
serving the home intact, and where the particular 
form of industry is favourable to it. Throughout 
whole districts in France individuals continue de- 
liberately and in defiance of the law to sacrifice their 
own fortunes to the welfare of the Family, or 
rather to find their own fortunes in the welfare of 
the Family. Of Auvergne, M. Demolins writes: 
“The family community is now reduced, as in the 
Pyrenees and the Causses, to its simplest expression ; 
it comprises the ménage of the parents, that of the 
son who is the héritier-associé, and the unmarried 
brothers and sisters. In the greater part of Auvergne, 
as in the two preceding types, and still under the 
influence of the pastoral art, they continue to make 
an ‘heir’ who represents the community. . . . The 
old custom of giving more to that one of the children 
who carries on the Family survives in the mountains. 
‘Tl faut que la maison fume,’ it is said everywhere; 
that is, the home must be maintained in a certain 
degree of relative comfort, and for that purpose an 
‘eldest son’ is made, an heir, to whom the house is 
left, together with its furniture, the beasts on the 
farm, and the fields or meadows which surround it 
or lie nearest to it as an appanage. The new ménage 
brings its contingent of labour, and lives in common 
with relations of all ages and all degrees. Thus 
several generations are united under one roof, re- 
cognising the authority of the head of the Family so 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
126 THE FAMILY PART I 
long as he remains capable of ruling. Besides the 
children, the father, and the grandfather, there are 
always in the house unmarried uncles and aunts, 
working for the profit of the house, regarding the 
children who are born as their own, and almost 
always leaving to the heir their share in the inheri- 
tance from the grandparents and whatever savings 
they have been able to make. . . . Many young men 
give up all idea of becoming heads of Families them- 
selves, in order that they may add to the welfare of 
the home. Many girls courageously devote them- 
selves to celibacy and remain at home, knowing that 
they will never be paid for their work, and that later 
on they will have to submit to the rule of children 
yet unborn. One of the material effects of the 
application of these ideas is, that the property is 
almost always preserved intact in the hands of one 
member in each Family. ‘Morcellement’ is a thing 
unknown in the mountains.” * 
But though this type still continues in Auvergne, 
M. Demolins thinks that it shows signs of dis- 
appearing. “The fact is, there are two distinct 
types of Auvergnats. The one, represented by the 
old parents, by the heir, and by all the Auvergnats 
who remain in the country, continues to depend 
frankly upon the pastoral tradition of community of 
life; it is the type of the past, and tends to decline. 
The other, represented by the children who emigrate, 
has resolutely abandoned the old traditional supports; 
it is not jealous of the preference given to the heir, 
1 Demolins, Les Francais d’aujourd hui, p. 62.
-P-A-G-E-133
CHAP. V AND THE STATE 127 
because it feels able by its industry alone to earn 
money more quickly than he can.” 
Nevertheless the family community is found to 
persist, not only among the pastoral peoples, but also 
among the olive-growers of Provence, and the vine- 
growers of Armagnac. 
“J Armagnac,” M. Laudet tell us, “is perhaps the 
region of France which struggles most persistently 
against the law of succession of the Code Civil. 
Ingenious ways are devised of avoiding equal parti- 
tion. The institution of an heir, to whom is assigned 
the free share (la quotité disponable), is habitual in all 
classes of society. It is generally the eldest son who 
is preferred. But sometimes the choice of the 
testator falls upon the younger son, or even upon the 
daughter in preference to the son. Above all, the 
breaking up of the paternal domain must be avoided. 
. .. The remaining brothers and sisters continue to 
live under the same roof. They like to live to- 
gether. .. . In many families it is no rare thing to 
find the old bachelor or old maid, the uncle or aunt, 
who has abandoned his rights almost entirely in 
order to promote the establishment of a brother or 
sister and guard against the family domain being 
broken up.” 
A similar resistance to the dispersion of the family 
community is found in Corsica and in Anjou. In 
the latter district especially, we are told that “to 
separate, to break the ties which bind them to each 
other, to renounce the life in common, causes them 
extraordinary distress. . . . Parents keep their
-P-A-G-E-134
128 THE FAMILY PART I 
married children with them, by family arrangement 
or as salaried servants; at the death of one the 
survivor holds uncontested sway and maintains the 
common life... . In the upper class great efforts 
are made to maintain the position of the family by 
artificial proceedings. The great proprietors have 
been established on their estates for generations by 
means of a system of integral transmission. The 
great problem for every family is to avoid the com- 
pulsory division and transmit the estate entire to the 
eldest son. To enable them to do so they dream of 
a rich marriage, by means of which the eldest son can 
compensate his brothers and sisters. It is hoped 
that the other brothers, generally in the army, may, 
thanks to their uniform, marry well enough to be 
moderate in their claims when the time for division 
comes. The girls are kept at home, for want of a 
dot to marry them, or are even sent to a convent,” * 
That in the long run the law will prevail is 
possible, and the Family will cease to find its strength 
in relation to a common property in proportion as 
the individual members feel themselves capable of 
achieving an independent career through their own 
exertions. But it is not inconceivable that as France 
finds her rural population flocking into the cities, 
where every country youth first seeks his fortunes, 
she may reconsider her policy, and either attempt to 
throw the weight of legislation the other way, or 
leave the people free to handle their property as 
1 Les Francais @aujourd’ hut, pp. 354-55. 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
CHAP. V AND THE STATE 129 
may seem best in the interests of the Family as a 
whole. 
When we turn to Germany we find the State 
exercising its influence in an exactly opposite direc- 
tion. In Prussia, after a long series of reforms 
designed to break.down the feudal dependence of the 
peasantry upon the nobility, and to encourage an 
increase of free peasant proprietors, a reaction has set 
in which—as in France—takes the form of limiting 
the peasant’s freedom in disposing of his property. 
But instead of enforcing equal division amongst the 
children, Prussian legislation favours a form of 
primogeniture under which the land and homestead 
must pass undivided to one heir (the eldest son by 
preference), and the remaining children can be pro- 
vided for only from other sources or by a small 
charge upon the estate. It is true that this law of 
“ Anerbenrecht” applies primarily only to a certain 
class of properties known as “ Rentengiiter,” and not 
to freehold land; but there seems no doubt that the 
State desires to see it applied universally, and that 
the tendency is for its sphere of application to in- 
crease. The policy is variously ascribed to different 
motives. Herr Brunner, in his Grundztige der 
deutschen Rechtsgeschichte, speaks of it as directed 
against the overburdening of the land with mort- 
gages, and its overdivision into too small holdings. 
Brentano, on the other hand, regards it as the out- 
come of a reactionary movement on the part of the 
Junkerthum, and an attempt to reintroduce feudal 
K
-P-A-G-E-136
130 THE FAMILY PART I 
conditions amongst a free peasantry. But it does 
not appear that the State has been influenced by 
considerations either of the type of Family to be 
favoured, or of justice towards the individual mem- 
bers of the Family, in pursuing its policy. Indeed, 
Brentano maintains that in introducing the law the 
State has been concerned merely for the maintenance 
in good condition of the land, and not at all for the 
people upon theland. He represents the argument of 
its main supporter, Dr. Miquel, as follows: “ We re- 
introduce the feudal system by which the succeeding 
heir is favoured at the expense of his brothers and 
sisters; for when the State makes such sacrifices in 
order to found a new peasantry, it cannot, of course, be 
guided by a sentimental regard for persons, but only 
by regard for the productiveness of the newly-created 
farm. It is not man who is the object and aim of 
national economy ; for the clear understanding of the 
Manchester School it was capital, and for the wise 
agrarian politician it can be nothing else than the 
farm.” 
Although the State was not primarily interested 
in the Family, it could not of course be ignored that 
it was directly interfering in its management and 
organisation, and the justification offered took the 
line of Le Play’s argument in defence of the famille- 
souche. It was necessary, it was said, that the 
younger brothers and sisters should be sacrificed fo 
the sake of preserving the estate in the possessio 
of the Family. Moreover, the apparent sacrifice wa: 
really a benefit, inasmuch as a shelter’ was preserve
-P-A-G-E-137
CHAP. V AND THE STATE 131 
for the old age of the younger members, while the 
heir worked hard throughout his life in order to pay 
their annuities from the estate. In short, the attempt 
is made to represent the compulsory “ Anerbenrecht” 
as parallel to the voluntary and customary com- 
munity of property, to which, as we have seen, so 
many of the European peasants still cling. 
But the parallel does not really hold. There is no 
community of property under the Prussian “ Aner- 
benrecht”; the brothers and sisters are neither 
intended nor expected to stay on in the home; and 
their claim upon the estate—which at best is very 
small—expires after the lapse of thirty-three years, 
at the time, that is, when they are most likely to need 
a shelter.* 
And most important difference of all, the arrange- 
ment is a compulsory one, and forced upon a people 
whose traditions and customs are opposed to it. Nor 
is it possible for them to avoid the law by any 
mutual agreement amongst themselves, as the French 
peasant avoids Ais law; for the State, being for the 
most part landlord of the ‘‘ Rentengiiter,” has a direct 
interest in seeing its provisions carried out. Brentano, 
who is strongly opposed to the policy, describes its 
effect in Polish Prussia as follows: “The ‘ Aner- 
benrecht’ conflicts so strongly with the sense of 
justice of the Polish people that many are prevented 
by it from taking land. Again, it often happens that 
a father who holds land would stay at home to culti- 
vate it while the sons went to the industrial districts 
1 Brentano, p. 335.
-P-A-G-E-138
132 THE FAMILY PART I 
of the west, where money wages are higher, where 
they would save money and send it home to be used 
towards the purchase of the land. Or if the estate 
were larger, the father would cultivate it with his 
grown children, and so save the wages of hired 
servants, and be able the sooner to extinguish his 
debt. Under ‘Anerbenrecht’ neither arrangement 
can survive, and in very many cases the existence of 
the holder of a ‘Rentengut’ would be endangered. 
Hence the Polish associations for acquiring land have 
reverted to purchasing land for capital instead of 
rent, and to self-help instead of State-help.” 
And as with the Prussian Poles, so also will it be, 
thinks Brentano, with the other peoples affected by 
the law. “I have no doubt that so soon as the 
peasants have practical experience of the change in 
the law of succession, the children will leave the 
homestead when they are old enough to seek work 
in the town, since their work upon the farm would 
profit the heir alone, and not themselves.” Hence 
the probability that the peasants will avoid acquiring 
land under the conditions attaching to “ Renten- 
giiter.” “Should this not be so—if the law of suc- 
cession of ‘ Rentengiiter’ becomes applicable without 
modification—then the excluded heirs must utilise 
their scanty allowance to hasten into the towns or 
to foreign countries, where they would have better 
prospects of success.” * 
If Brentano’s view of the situation is correct, we get 
the apparent paradox that the Prussian and French 
1 Brentano, p. 347.
-P-A-G-E-139
CHAP. V AND THE STATE 133 
law of inheritance, though directly opposed in their 
policy, have the same result in breaking up the 
family life, and hastening the exodus from country 
to town. The truth would seem to be that any 
legislative interference with the relation between the 
Family and its property which does not accord with 
the customs and traditions of the people will, just so 
far as it is operative, break through the ties which 
hold the members of the Family together. And when 
the members of the Family have once been brought 
to regard their interests as conflicting, they have no 
choice but to separate. If circumstances permit of 
each acquiring sufficient land for his maintenance, 
they may still continue on the land; but in Western 
Europe this can rarely happen now, and nothing 
remains but for the majority to seek their fortunes in 
the towns or in emigration, 
That the law will not always succeed at once in 
prevailing against tradition and immemorial custom 
we have already seen; and a striking instance is 
cited by Brentano in which a law attempting to 
regulate succession not only failed to take effect, but 
met with such determined opposition from the people 
that it had to be withdrawn. “ About the same time 
that attempts were being made in France to re- 
introduce the droit d’ainesse, we find the West- 
phalian Provincial Assembly, which was dominated 
by the nobility, proposing to introduce a legal 
‘Anerbenrecht.’” In 1836 a law was passed, and in 
1842, owing to the determined opposition of the 
people, it was repealed. The failure was the more
-P-A-G-E-140
134 THE FAMILY PART I 
curious in that ‘“ Anerbenrecht,” the inheritance by 
one child, was already customary in many families, 
and the law was applicable only in cases of intestacy. 
But “as soon as it came into force a storm of dis- 
content and vehement resistance arose among the 
peasantry, and the hostile feeling was so strong as 
to lead to all sorts of attempts to evade the law. 
Fictitious contracts were made to avert its applica- 
tion, and other similar measures devised ; it was even 
reported that some of the peasants lived ‘in wilder 
Ehe,’ so as to have no legitimate children to whom 
the law could apply.” The reason for this opposition 
lay “in the infinite variety of needs arising out of 
the particular circumstances of each family. No law, 
however framed, could satisfy all these; but must 
conflict with interests in one direction or another.” -
-P-A-G-E-141
  CHAPTER VI 
THE FAMILY AND THE STATE IN ENGLAND 
Ir is notable that in England at the present day 
neither the Family in general nor the law of inherit- 
ance attracts much attention either from statesmen 
or from economists. In the past, indeed, the system 
of Primogeniture has been made to play a most 
effective part in determining the social history of the 
people; and it still holds its own, both as a custom 
and as the law of intestacy, with respect to the 
inheritance of land. But comparatively few Families 
in England are now directly affected by regulations 
or customs attaching to the inheritance of land. 
Amongst a peasantry whose sole opportunity of 
making a livelihood lies in the actual possession of 
land, it is of vital importance whether or not each 
member of a Family can in some way share in that 
opportunity ; but to a people long accustomed to 
regard their living as depending upon their wage- 
earning capacity, questions of the inheritance of 
landed property become of minor importance. In 
England for the great mass of the people their 
dependence upon the land is so indirect and remote 
that the introduction of such a law as the Prussian 
135
-P-A-G-E-142
    136 THE FAMILY PART I 
“ Anerbenrecht” would have no appreciable effect 
upon their lives. A law of equal division, as in 
France, would be applicable, of course, to all Families 
possessing movable property, as well as those pos- 
sessing land; but here again the English working- 
classes depend so much less upon the investment of 
capital than upon their individual skill and capacity 
as wage-earners, that such a law would have little 
effect either in increasing or diminishing their pros- 
perity. That could only really be touched by 
legislation which should affect either the source of 
those qualities upon which they mainly depend for 
earning a living, or the industries in which those 
qualities are available. 
In so far, indeed, as agriculture is one amongst 
other industries, any legislation affecting the distribu- 
tion of land would also indirectly affect the position 
of the wage-earners employed upon it. If more land 
is made available for agricultural purposes, the demand 
for agricultural labourers may increase, and their 
position improve. If, again, the acquisition of small 
holdings is encouraged, we may possibly revive a class 
of peasantry in direct dependence upon the land, to 
whom the law of inheritance may once more become 
of importance. It is possible, therefore, that the 
time may yet come when Statesmen in England will, 
as on the Continent, turn their attention to the 
question of controlling the descent of property in the 
Family. 
If we turn to the history of the question in
-P-A-G-E-143
cHap. vi AND THE STATE IN ENGLAND 137 
England we find, on the contrary, that the relation 
between the Family and its property has been in 
the past a matter of anxious consideration to States- 
men, and in later times to economists. The history, 
taken in its broad outlines, starts from the position 
of the Anglo-Saxons. We have already seen how land 
may be possessed either in common by all members of 
a community, or by the Family, or by the individual. 
Amongst the Anglo-Saxons much of the land was 
held in common by the village communities—public 
property. But what private property there was 
belonged not to the individual but to the Family. 
“The economic unit amongst the Anglo-Saxons, as 
amongst other peoples at an early stage of culture, 
was not the individual but the household. The 
property was the common property of all members of 
the household; all together were responsible for the 
action of each; the claims of one were the claims of 
all; industry was carried on in common under the 
guidance of the eldest or father of the family.” ? 
It followed from this common possession of the 
property by the Family that there was no inheritance, 
properly speaking. When the chief died the Family 
did not die. It continued as before to hold and work 
the land in common, only under the guidance of a 
new chief. But should the Family break up, and 
cease therefore to exist as an economic unit, then the 
property would be equally divided amongst the male 
members; and inasmuch as such a dissolution would 
tend to take place, if at all, at the death of the chief 
1 Brentano, p. 180. 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
138 THE FAMILY PART I 
by whose authority it had been ruled, the division of 
the property might not unnaturally come to be 
regarded in time as a form of inheritance from the 
father. But originally it would seem that when a 
division took place the dead man himself was assigned 
his share: a share which took the form of animals to 
be sacrificed or articles to be buried with him, and 
which was in later times diverted to the Church, as 
payment for attending to the welfare of his soul. We 
find the same feeling, if not actually a relic of the 
same custom, amongst many of our people to-day, in 
the pompous funeral rites which are held to be the 
dead man’s due from the surviving members of his 
Family. 
But there was always one portion of the family 
property which was not susceptible of division, and 
that was the homestead. Not only amongst the 
Anglo-Saxons, but also amongst the Celts (notably 
in Wales) it was customary for this to be assigned to 
the youngest son. Various explanations have been 
given for this custom (known as borough-English), 
and all seem to point to the fact that the elder sons 
had left the Family before the death of the father. 
In that case, whether they had already received their 
full share of the property or not, they would have 
made their own homes, and it was natural that the 
old homestead should fall as his share to the son who 
had remained longest under the rule of his parents. 
But even after division had become prevalent, the 
holders of the divided property were held to be 
incapable of disposing of their shares without the
-P-A-G-E-145
  cuapr. vi ‘AND THE STATE IN ENGLAND 139 
consent of the relations; they could not, therefore, 
dispose of them by will. At the time of the Conquest 
this inflexible tie between the Family and its pro- 
perty had somewhat relaxed, Brentano thinks under 
the influence of the Church, which would be likely to 
profit by the freedom of the individual to bequeath 
_ to it some of the family property ; but the prevalent 
form of inheritance continued to be equal division 
amongst male children, with the homestead going as 
his share to the youngest son. 
From this to the system of Primogeniture, which 
gave the property to the eldest son with total or 
partial exclusion of the remaining children, was 
surely one of the most striking of the many changes 
introduced by the Norman Conquest. It could 
hardly have been imposed even upon a conquered 
people unless there had been some circumstances to 
soften the abruptness of the change, and make it 
seem, to a certain extent, in accordance with the 
custom of the people. Perhaps the principal mediator 
would be the old conception of the Family as a 
community, which still maintained its interest in the 
family property as a whole, even after its actual 
appropriation to individual use. This conception 
made its influence felt amongst the Anglo-Saxons 
in the restrictions imposed upon the individual in 
the disposal of his land; and amongst their Norman 
conquerors in the exertions made by the feudal head 
of the Family to promote the fortunes of the younger 
branches. The feudal system was not originally in- 
consistent with the equal division of the property 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
    140 THE FAMILY PART I 
amongst sons. Brentano quotes from the libri 
feudorum: “Vasallo mortuo ad filios aequaliter 
pertinet feudum.”* But even after Primogeniture 
had become firmly established as custom, and for a 
time even as law, the head of the Family and its 
junior branches have continued to regard themselves 
more or less as a community with common interests. 
It is, of course, a long step from a community in 
which the property is merely managed by the head 
in the interests of all to one in which it is owned 
by the head, even though he may continue to bear the 
interests of all in mind; but the moral sense of the 
people might be less offended by such a step than by 
a change which would have brought about a complete 
dissolution of the Family. 
In the second place, the people were already, to 
some extent, prepared for the preference of one son 
above the others by the custom of borough-English. 
The homestead, which went to the youngest son, 
must always have seemed the most important share 
of the inheritance, as being the centre, not only of 
the property, but also of the whole family tradition, 
history, and association. And in the disturbed and 
dangerous times which followed upon the Conquest 
the concentration of power in the hands of the eldest, 
and therefore presumably the strongest member of the 
Family, might come to be recognised as an advantage 
even by the younger sons themselves. 
But the change in the family organisation was 
due, for the main part, to the fact that the chief 
1 Brentano, op. cit. p. 181.
-P-A-G-E-147
cuar. vi AND THE STATE IN ENGLAND 141 
ownership of the land had itself changed. Instead 
of belonging directly to Families, it now belonged 
to the king. “Land was held by the Church in 
return for dues of prayer or praise, by the knight 
in return for military service, by the small freeman 
in return for service and rent.” And when land 
was thus held as a fief, it became necessary for the 
Family to select a representative to be invested 
with it; this representative was the eldest member, 
and from him the remaining members of the Family 
held their share of the inheritance as tenants. 
“From this function of the eldest member as chief 
ruler of the family estate there developed gradually 
an exclusive right, ae. Primogeniture.” : 
It was with respect to land granted to the Normans 
that the new method of inheritance first prevailed ; 
the obligation to preserve the property intact being 
imposed as a source of strength to the Family, which 
would enable it to hold its own against a conquered 
but hostile people. Amongst the Saxons the ultimate 
ownership of the land passed also to the Crown, and 
those who had previously been owners of small free- 
hold properties (socage land) now held them from a 
feudal lord in return for services and dues. Here, 
however, the Crown had no object in enforcing a 
strong organisation, and the custom of equal in- 
lheritance was preserved for two hundred years after 
he Conquest.! “ But the judges were in favour of 
he feudal system. Where it could not be expressly 
roved that equal inheritance had prevailed in the 
1 Brentano, p. 182.
-P-A-G-E-148
142 THE FAMILY PART I 
past, they presumed in favour of Primogeniture. 
But no such proof was forthcoming when a Family 
had so far held together and no division had taken 
place within the memory of man. So here also, before 
the end of the thirteenth century, Primogeniture 
triumphed, except in Kent, where equal inheritance 
by the sons—the special mark of Saxon freedom— 
persists until to-day.” Even in Kent many lands 
have now been “ disgavelled” by the wish of the 
owners, and subjected to the ordinary law of Primo- 
geniture.’ 
Amongst those of the peasants who held their land 
on servile tenure there was originally no inheritance, 
even by the Family as a whole. They worked the 
land in the interests of their lord, and he was sole 
heir. Gradually it was found convenient to recognise 
the succession of the children to the land worked by 
their fathers; but it was always the Family as such 
which succeeded. But should the Family break up, 
then the land passed intact—for the lord would not 
permit division—to one son, and this son, in analogy 
to the custom of borough-English, was the youngest. 
“The succession of the youngest was so universal 
amongst the serfs as actually to stand for a mark of 
servitude. It was for this reason that it disappeared, 
with few exceptions, in the course of economic pro- 
gress. The commutation of services into money 
payments begins with the twelfth century. In the 
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries it forms the chie 
feature of the social development of the country. An 
1 Cecil, Primogeniture,
-P-A-G-E-149
  cuar. vi AND THE STATE IN ENGLAND 143 
it is characteristic that with this substitution of money 
payments for services there appears also the change 
in the system of inheritance. Instead of the succes- 
sion of the youngest, which had become a mark of 
servitude, the aristocratic system of Primogeniture 
prevails,”* and with Primogeniture there emerges 
also the problem of the younger brother. 
We see, then, that in England also Primogeniture 
was introduced by the State as a definite policy, 
designed to strengthen the ruling powers by the 
creation and maintenance of great Families, able to 
hold their own in a hostile country. It was a 
practical recognition by Statecraft of the close 
relation between the Family and the State, a relation 
which was to vary through succeeding centuries 
between mutual support and the deadliest conflict, 
and which led to constant efforts on one side or the 
other to diminish or enhance the greatness of the 
Family ; and it must be borne in mind that though 
the State has concerned itself little in the past with 
the family life of the great mass of the people, yet 
no policy affecting the nobles, no privilege conceded 
to or blow struck at the “great Families” could be 
altogether without effect upon the more obscure. 
We have just seen how the introduction of Primo- 
geniture spread through all classes down to the 
lowest. Even more important to the welfare of the 
people, though less direct in its action, was the dis- 
tribution of land effected by the varying success and

-P-A-G-E-150
144 THE FAMILY PART I 
failure of the great Families to maintain their estates 
intact and secure their transmission to their heirs. 
Instead of following the whole course of legislation 
and custom in respect to Primogeniture in England 
and its effect upon the Family, it will be sufficient for 
the present purpose to select some of the more 
characteristic moments as illustrations. The first of 
these is the creation of entails in 1285 by the Act 
known as de donis conditionalibus. This was a 
measure introduced by the greater feudal lords and 
the Crown to secure that the estates granted by 
them should pass intact to the direct descendants of 
the man to whom they were originally granted, and 
failing the direct heir should revert to the lord; . . . 
“the owner of land which had been granted to him, 
and his heirs could no longer alienate the estate or 
burden it with debt, either wholly or partially, for 
longer than his lifetime; he became the mere life 
user of the property, and after his death it passed to 
his eldest son, who then found himself in the same 
legal position. On the other hand, the estate could 
not be confiscated for high treason for longer than 
the lifetime of the present owner.” A clause of 
special importance this to the feudal lord, who 
naturally resented seeing his property confiscated by 
the Crown because of his tenant’s misbehaviour. 
Economically the effect of the law was reactionary. 
It secured, indeed, the feudal lords in their rights over 
their tenants, and against any possible diminution of 
the extent of their influence in so far as this arose out
-P-A-G-E-151
cuapr. vi AND THE STATE IN ENGLAND 145 
of landed property. But it also, at a time when 
there was a great movement towards the more 
intensive cultivation of land, secured that estates 
should remain under the control of one line of men, 
quite irrespective of their capacity or desire to im- 
prove them. And its effect upon family relations 
and the education of the young would seem to have 
been still worse. Bacon writes of this in terms which 
seem to justify all Le Play’s arguments in favour of 
maintaining a father’s authority by preserving his 
liberty of bequest: “Entails began by a statute 
made in Edw. I.’s time ; by which also they are so 
much strengthened, as the tenant in tail could not put 
away the land from the heir by any act of convey- 
ance or attainder, nor let it nor encumber it longer 
than his own life. But the inconvenience thereof was 
great; for by that means, the land being so sure tied 
upon the heir as his father could not put it from him, 
it made the son to be disobedient, negligent, and 
wasteful, often marrying without the father’s consent, 
and to grow insolent in vice knowing that there could 
be no check of disinherison over him. It also made 
the owners of land less fearful themselves to commit 
murders, felonies, treasons, and manslaughters; for 
that they knew none of these acts could hurt the heir 
in his inheritance. It hindered men that had entailed 
lands, that they could not make the best of their 
lands by fine and improvement ; for that none, upon 
so uncertain an estate as for term of his own life, 
would give him a fine of any value, nor lay any great 
stock upon the land that might yield rent improved : 
L
-P-A-G-E-152

146 THE FAMILY PART I 
and, lastly, these entails did defraud the Crown and 
many subjects of their debts; for that the land was 
not liable longer than his own lifetime; which made 
that the king could not safely commit an office of 
account to such whose lands were entailed, nor other 
men trust them with loans of money.” * 
This represents the high-water mark in England 
of what we may call the subjection of the Family to 
its property, its inability to handle it freely in the 
interests of the living, and at the same time of the 
greater security of the Family itself against dissolu- 
tion or obscurity. Notwithstanding the great and 
obvious disadvantages of the situation, the nobles 
were strenuously opposed to any legislative change, 
because of the protection afforded to them against con- 
fiscation by the Crown ; and when they desired greater 
freedom in dealing with their land, they contented 
themselves with evading the law by means of legal 
subtleties. But as time passed on the nobles ceased 
to be the pillars of the State; the Crown came to 
regard the great Families as rivals rather than allies, 
and under Henry VIII. permanent entails were made 
finally impossible in England.* Laws were passed 
also which made it possible for landowners both to 
sell their land during their lifetime, and to dispose of 
it by will at death: “So it came to pass that from 
the end of the fifteenth to the end of the seventeenth

Brentano in German, p. 188. 
2 The only exceptions now are estates which have been purchased with 
money provided by Parliament and presented to eminent men and their heirs 
in return for public services, e.g. Blenheim and Strathfieldsaye. 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
cHAP. VI AND THE STATE IN ENGLAND 147 
century landowners had practically complete freedom 
of dealing with their land, both during life and at 
death. But those are the two centuries in which, 
for the first time in England, the transition to more 
intensive occupation of the land took place to any 
extent, while at the same time England could boast 
of a numerous and free class of small farmers.” 
In saying this Brentano probably attributes more 
prosperity to the freeing of the land than is warranted 
by the industrial history of England. One great 
feature of the earlier part of the period in question 
was the rapid growth of sheep-farming, in consequence 
of which many small holders were turned out of their 
farms, and the land thrown into great sheep-walks. 
      
        
    
   
   
    
   
   ut when once the land was freed there was always 
he probability of its being put to good use, since 
hose who could not make it support them would sell 
0 those who could. 
Under the Tudors, then, the policy of the Crown 
as directed towards weakening the great Families, 
nd in this policy it looked for its main support to 
he people. Hence the legislation prohibiting entails, 
hich had for its effect the loosening of that tie 
etween a Family and its property which previously 
lerved to maintain the ascendency of a noble Family 
gainst the weakness due to division, or against the 
issoluteness of any one member. 
But under the Stuarts the policy was again re- 
ersed ; once more the aristocracy prevailed and were 
le to legislate in their own interests. For us the 
gnificant feature of the change lies in the reintro-
-P-A-G-E-154
148 THE FAMILY PART I 
duction of entails; in England under the modified 
form of “Settlements” in the reign of Charles II., 
and in Scotland as permanent entails under James II. 
In both cases Brentano attributes the movement in 
the first instance to the need felt by the nobles of 
protecting their estates against confiscation for high 
treason: “ But even after the need of protecting 
themselves against confiscation for high treason had 
passed, both the new-fashioned English and the old- 
fashioned Scottish entails could not fail to be accept- 
able to large proprietors. The limitations on aliena- 
tion and indebtedness which they imposed upon the 
proprietor undoubtedly served to enrich at least one 
member in the family in each generation. And the 
more aristocratic the Government of Great Britain 
became, the greater would be the influence of this 
one member if he were very rich.” 
During the last century the Family has lost much 
of its political importance in England. It is tru 
that the ideas of the Crown and of the Royal Famil 
are inseparably connected in the English mind; bu 
the Crown, as represented by the Royal Family, n 
longer needs to maintain its supremacy either throug 
the assistance of, or in conflict with, the other grea 
Families of the nation. On the other hand, th 
possibilities of being involved in high treason are s 
remote, that the great Families no longer need t 
protect their estates from confiscation by devices 
settlement and entail. Nor is there any serio 
political rivalry between them and the people. T.
-P-A-G-E-155
cHaP. vi AND THE STATE IN ENGLAND 149 
Cecils may continue to have periods of predominance 
in political administration ; the House of Elder Sons 
may now and again succeed in placing a check upon 
some popular legislative proposal; but all are well 
aware that their influence is maintained only in the 
interests of the nation as a whole, and cannot be 
permanently at variance with the popular will. If 
any serious conflict of interests remains between the 
persistence of the aristocratic principle of Primo- 
geniture and the democratic principle of the equality 
of brothers, we must look for it in the spheres of 
social and economic life rather than of politics. 
It was in relation to the land question that an 
economic conflict first became pressing and obvious. 
Adam Smith represented it as follows: “In Europe 
the law of primogeniture and perpetuities of different 
kinds, prevent the division of great estates, and 
thereby hinder the multiplication of small proprietors. 
A small proprietor, however, who knows every part 
of his little territory, who views it with all the 
affection which property, especially small property, 
naturally inspires, and who upon that account takes 
pleasure not only in cultivating but in adorning it, is 
generally of all improvers the most industrious, the 
most intelligent, and the most successful. The same 
regulations, besides, keep so much land out of the 
market that there are always more capitals to buy 
than there is land to sell, so that what is sold always 
sells at a monopoly price. The rent never pays the 
interest of the purchase money, and is besides
-P-A-G-E-156
  150 THE FAMILY PART I 
burdened with repairs and other occasional charges 
to which the interest of money is not liable... . 
If landed estates, however, were divided equally 
among all the children, upon the death of any pro- 
prietor who left a numerous family, the estate would 
generally be sold. So much land would come to 
market that it could no longer sell at a monopoly 
price. The free rent of the land would go nearer to 
pay the interest of the purchase money, and a small 
capital might be employed in purchasing land as 
profitably as in any other way.” 
Here then was a clear case of conflict between the 
Family and the community, in so far as the Family 
found it essential to its maintenance to preserve its 
hold upon the land by means of Primogeniture, and 
in so far as any considerable section of the community 
was in fact debarred from making its livelihood upon 
the land. Why was it that such a clear conflict was 
so slow to lead to any reconciling change? Bren- 
tano suggests the following causes. 
In the first place, the French Revolution with all 
its terrors had included the abolition of Primogeniture 
and entails. Hence there was a reaction in England, 
a reaction perhaps of feeling rather than of reason, in 
favour of leaving the old order undisturbed notwith- 
standing its disadvantages. 
In the second place, the class of small cultivators 
which Adam Smith had in mind, and which would 
mainly have profited by the breaking up of landed 
estates, had already disappeared to a large extent. 
Again, the increasing tendency towards cultiva-
-P-A-G-E-157
  cHaPp. vi AND THE STATE IN ENGLAND 151 
tion on a large scale, due to the introduction of new 
methods, was all in favour of large estates rather 
than small holdings. The significance of this change 
may be estimated by comparing the following passages 
from A. Smith and Froude, the latter written just a 
hundred years after the former. 
A. Smith, bk. iii. chap. ii, (1776)—“ It seldom 
happens, however, that a great proprietor is a great 
improver. . . . To improve land with profit, like all 
other commercial projects, requires an exact attention 
to small savings and small gains, of which a man 
born to a great fortune, even though naturally frugal, 
is very seldom capable. The situation of such a 
person naturally disposes him to attend rather to 
ornament which pleases his fancy, than to profit for 
which he has so little occasion. The elegance of his 
dress, of his equipage, of his house, and household 
furniture, are objects which from his infancy he has 
been accustomed to have some anxiety about. The 
turn of mind which this habit naturally forms, follows 
him when he comes to think of the improvement of 
land. He embellishes perhaps four or five hundred 
acres in the neighbourhood of his house, at ten times 
the expense which the land is worth after all his im- 
provements ; and finds that if he was to improve his 
whole estate in the same manner, and he has little 
taste for any other, he would be a bankrupt before he 
had finished the tenth part of it. There still remains 
in both parts of the United Kingdom some great 
estates which have continued without interruption in
-P-A-G-E-158
  152 THE FAMILY PART 1 
the hands of the same family since the times of feudal 
anarchy. Compare the present condition of those 
estates with possessions of the small proprietors in 
their neighbourhood, and you will require no other 
argument to convince you how unfavourable such 
extensive property is to improvement.” 
Froude, On the Uses of a Landed Gentry (1876)— 
“ And the farther what is called the land monopoly 
is carried, the more, that is, the small estates are 
absorbed in the large, the better these duties will be 
performed. I don’t know how it may be in Scotland, 
but I know that in England you can tell by the look 
of the country which you are passing through whether 
it belongs to a large landowner or a small one. 
Compare an estate owned by one man with a hundred 
thousand a year, and a similar estate divided among 
a hundred owners with a thousand a year each. On 
which of these will the working tenants find them- 
selves best off? The one great man’s establishment 
may be expensive, but after all it is but one. The 
expenses of the most splendid household’ will not 
reach a hundred thousand a year, or half that sum, 
or a quarter of it. The great man is on a pedestal. 
If he is evil spoken of, his pedestal becomes a pillory. 
Therefore he does not press his rights when he might 
press them. The customs of the manor are generally 
observed. Farm buildings are kept in good condition, 
fences are in good repair, cottages have roofs which 
will keep the rain out. You find churches, you find 
schools, you find everything which public opinion  
-P-A-G-E-159
cHaP. vi AND THE STATE IN ENGLAND 153 
demands or approves. Turn to the estate which is 
divided between the hundred less conspicuous pro- 
prietors. Will an equal margin of income be forth- 
coming for improvements? Will there be the same 
consideration for tenants and labourers? There can- 
not be, because a hundred private establishments 
have to be supported instead of one, and a hundred 
families struggling to maintain the position of gentry 
with inadequate means. By them every farthing 
which their estate will yield is required for their 
ordinary expenditure. They are embarrassed. They 
must borrow. Their obvious duties are left undone. 
You read the story in unmended. fences, in broken 
gates, in decaying farmhouses. At length a crisis 
comes, and unless entail interferes the land is sold to 
some one who can better afford to keep it.” 
Froude’s estimate of the advantages of large estates 
may be an exaggerated one, but it certainly represents 
one of the reasons why there has not been more 
change in the direction of subdividing landed pro- 
perty. Still another reason may be found in the 
fact that the enormous growth of manufacturing 
industries and commerces, bringing life in the towns 
and the possibilities of early marriage, afforded more 
attractive opportunities to the mass of the people 
than the cultivation of small holdings, and so pre- 
vented any popular demand for legislation. More- 
over, in England at any rate, and to some extent in 
Scotland, the exclusion of the people from the pos- 
session of the land does not necessarily, mean its 
exclusion from the occupation and cultivation of the
-P-A-G-E-160
154 THE FAMILY PART I 
land; and should any considerable demand arise for 
“small holdings” from people capable of cultivating 
them, it is unlikely that any vested interest will be 
allowed to stand in the way of the satisfaction of that 
demand. The policy of “ back to the land” is likely 
to find a far more serious obstacle in the almost com- 
plete estrangement of the present generation from a 
country life, than in the scarcity of available land. 
The latter can always be overcome, if need be, by 
legislation ; the former only by a change in deeply- 
rooted habits and capacities. 
Nevertheless, in the first half of the last century 
the monopoly became serious. At the beginning of 
the century it was shown that more than half the 
land in Scotland was entailed in a few hands, and 
hardly any was to be purchased. An attempt was 
made to modify Scottish entails to the less strict and 
less permanent form of English Settlements, but it 
was rejected by the House of Lords. 
Under the English system of Settlements the 
entail is broken every generation and the land re- 
settled ; an opportunity being thus afforded to pro- 
vide, at the heir’s expense, for the widow and younger 
children, as well as for improvements of the property. 
For a long time this was regarded, says Brentano, as 
the ideal system of inheritance, as a pillar of the 
constitution, both by the members of the aristocracy 
themselves and by those who stood outside. But it 
could not permanently stand the test of changing 
public opinion and economic development. In 1873 
the New Domesday Book was compiled, to ascertain
-P-A-G-E-161
cHap. vi AND THE STATE IN ENGLAND 155 
the facts about the ownership of land. It appeared 
that in England and Wales four-sevenths of the land 
was owned by 4000 persons, and almost a half by 2250 ; 
while in Scotland one man alone possessed 1,326,600 
acres, and almost a quarter of the land belonged to 
twelve persons, and half of it toseventy. “... the 
details, when looked into, do in part bear out what 
the agitators complained of. The House of Lords 
does own more than a third of the whole area of 
Great Britain. Two-thirds of it really belongs to 
great peers and commoners, whose estates are con- 
tinually devouring the small estates surrounding 
them. The remaining third, in and about the great 
towns, is subdivided, and the subdivision is con- 
tinually increasing, but the land there also is still 
falling mainly into the hands of the rich.”* It is 
little wonder that public opinion was impressed and 
sought for some means to check the growing monopoly. 
And public opinion was reinforced by the increasing 
difficulties of the landowners themselves. They were 
finding that their land demanded more and more 
investment of capital, while it was becoming more 
and more burdened with charges in favour of others 
than the heir. The conflict between the interests of 
the younger children and those of the eldest son, who 
would chiefly benefit from improvement of the estate 
and needed capital to work it to advantage, became 
acute; and it is principally to this conflict and its 
effect upon the minds of the landowners themselves 
that Brentano attributes the “Settled Land Act” of 
1 Froude, On the Uses of a Landed Gentry.
-P-A-G-E-162
156 THE FAMILY PART I 
1882. By this Act the owner for the time being of 
a Settled Estate is enabled to lease or sell at his 
discretion the whole or part of his estate, having 
regard to the interest of all parties entitled under the 
Settlement. The only part excepted from his dis- 
cretion of sale is the principal residence with the 
park belonging to it. ‘“ This does not mean that the 
right to make Family Settlements and to entail 
property has been abolished. That continues as 
before. But for the purposes of entail land is treated 
exactly as other forms of capital. Entailed land can 
be converted at any moment into any other kind of 
property. . . . Thus the fettering of the land by 
entails is abolished.” * 
With this great change there disappeared the 
principal reason for which the law of intestacy enforc- 
ing Primogeniture with respect to land had been 
maintained. . It could no longer be argued that 
the inviolable connection between a Family and its 
landed property was the necessary basis of an 
aristocracy ; and in both Houses of Parliament bills 
have been approved, though they have not passed 
into law, which would have introduced the equal 
division of land, as of other property, in cases of 
intestacy.” With respect to land, therefore, Primo- 
geniture still persists, as a custom recognised though 
not enforced by law. It is not unlikely to continue ; 
for with the Settled Land Act there disappeared not 
only the reason for it, but also the principal reason

against it. The ability of the owner to part with 
land which he cannot profitably cultivate removes the 
chief source of conflict between the supposed interests 
of the Family and those of the community ; and that 
being so, the public is little inclined to interest itself 
in the domestic question whether a father will treat 
all his children alike, or favour the eldest at the 
expense of the others. 
Thus the question is losing its economic sig- 
nificance and seems chiefly of domestic interest ; 
but socially it still retains importance. There can 
be no doubt that there tends to be a different type 
of social organisation, as well as the development 
of a different type of character, where a pre-eminent 
position in the Family is secured to the eldest son 
by endowing him more liberally with money, and by 
giving him a different education from the rest of 
the rising generation. “It would be difficult,” 
writes Mr. Courtney, “to exaggerate the tenacity 
with which this system has driven its roots into 
English society, and the importance of its influence 
over the working of the constitution. Profoundly 
conservative forces abide and flourish under it. 
Although the institution of County Councils and 
the reform of District Councils have taken away 
many of the administrative functions of county 
magistrates, their judicial influence is practically 
intact, and it is from the owners of land that the 
magistrates are mainly recruited. What has been 
called the squirearchy is thus maintained over 
great parts of England, and an order has been
-P-A-G-E-164
    158 THE FAMILY PART I 
established, entrance into which is an object of 
ambition to members of the industrial and com- 
mercial classes as they grow wealthier, and con- 
tinuance in which is jealously guarded on the part 
of those who have been born into it. The power of 
keeping together and handing down from father to 
son a sufficient endowment of property is almost a 
necessary accompaniment of the existence of any 
hereditary honours; and the security of the House 
of Lords, in which legislative privileges are hereditary 
along with titles of honour, would be seriously 
menaced if it were not buttressed by the influences 
derived from the possession of large estates spread 
throughout the country.” * 
Whether such a system is in the interests of the 
community is a question which has been argued from 
many points of view, and will continue to be argued 
so long as the system endures. The further question 
of how far it is in the interests of the favoured eldest 
son himself, and of how far injustice is inflicted upon 
the younger sons, involves further consideration,

    CHAPTER VII 
ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 
“THE power of perpetuating our property in our 
families is one of the most valuable and interesting 
circumstances belonging to it, and that which tends 
the most to the perpetuation of society itself. It 
makes our weakness subservient to our virtue; it 
grafts benevolence even upon avarice.” ? 
To be tolerably well assured that when at last we 
reluctantly loosen our hold upon our property it will 
be enjoyed and administered by our own children 
instead of passing into the hands of strangers, is 
doubtless a great inducement to refrain from con- 
suming it too freely in our immediate personal 
gratification. But although it affords a motive for 
accumulation, it can hardly by itself account for the 
persistent preference throughout centuries of change 
lof the eldest son at the expense of the younger; 
indeed under the law of equal division in France 
arents show themselves even more strenuously 
hrifty and self-denying in the interests of their 
hildren than in England. It is the desire to

159
-P-A-G-E-166
160 THE FAMILY PART I 
“found a Family,” or to maintain one, that upholds 
the custom of Primogeniture amongst us, and that 
is not altogether the same thing as the desire to 
leave our children the means of prosperity and 
comfort. To some extent, of course, it coincides ; 
but there are other and much more subtle motives 
combined with it, partly selfish, partly noble and 
disinterested. 
If we are to understand the persistence of a 
custom which seems at first sight so contrary to 
natural affection and justice, we must try in the 
first place to enter into the feeling of those to whom 
the Family is a very real and spiritual entity, com- 
prising far more than the human individuals who 
may happen to be in existence at any moment. 
For them the long line of ancestors still lives; not 
the shadowy life of ineffectual ghosts haunting the 
scenes of past activity, but a life of great deeds 
or noble achievements or unstained reputation still 
echoing in the souls of their descendants, moulding 
their characters, influencing their wills, and through 
them continuing long after the death of the body 
to be a living force amongst the living. And it is 
this inheritance, far more than any material wealth, 
which the noblest desire to preserve, not only for 
their children’s children, but for the nation also. 
It is an inheritance, indeed, which can never be 
wholly alienated nor entirely dissipated; we can- 
not, even if we would, shake ourselves free from| 
those who have preceded us; and from this point 
of view the man who knows nothing of his own
-P-A-G-E-167
CHAP. VIL ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 161 
grandfather may boast as long a line of ancestry as 
the proudest “Family.” But for-him his ancestors 
no longer live; his character has not been moulded 
by the knowledge of strength derived from them, 
nor his emulation fired by the desire to be worthy 
of them. He does not see himself as one link in 
a chain of spiritual life binding the generations 
together ; and he is ignorant of the rich possibilities 
which lie buried in his nature. No voices speak to 
him from the past of what men with like tempera- 
ments to his may do; no echoes of past failures 
warn him where his own peculiar dangers lie. His 
inheritance is there, but he is unconscious of it; and 
being unconscious of it, he can neither control it nor 
benefit from it as the man may do to whom it is a 
living reality. 
It seems at first sight a paradoxical thing to 
ugeest that an inheritance such as this, so spiritual 
in its nature, so strong in its spirituality, can depend 
pon such a material fact as maintaining a strong 
old upon the family acres. Cannot a man be 
indful of his ancestors as well in a back street as 
n a country house? be as nobly worthy of them in 
overty as in wealth? Yes, no doubt he can; but 
hen he must be a man of exceptionally fine and 
aginative character. Associations of place play 
very large, if unrealised, part in preserving this 
iritual inheritance. Amongst the peoples who 
ractise ancestor- worship it is always the old 
lomestic hearth which is sacred to the departed 
thers, and it is around the family homestead that 
M
-P-A-G-E-168
162 THE FAMILY PART I 
their spirits haunt. And so it is with us also. It 
is on the domestic hearth that the sacredness of 
the Family is most strongly felt and guarded; it is 
around the old homestead that we find again most 
often and most easily the spirits of our ancestors. 
Their memories and traditions live, not only in the 
- minds and hearts of the neighbouring people, but in 
the actual features of the country which have been 
moulded by their hands and wills. It is little 
wonder if in parting from his ancestral home the 
owner feels that he has loosened his hold also upon 
another and a far more important inheritance of 
which he has no right to deprive his children. 
But there is more in it even than this. So long 
as the old home remains, it is not only a link which 
binds together past and future into one present 
Family ; it also holds in one the different members 
of the living Family as no other place can do. The 
scene of a childhood passed in common, of joys and 
griefs shared in common, becomes in later life 
meeting-place where old relations can be renewed 
old feelings revived, and new joys and_ sorrow! 
awaken the old sympathies, and where again th 
younger generation can meet and knit the ties o 
friendship for the future. Unless the family hom 
does this for its sons and daughters, it falls far sho: 
of its highest function; but that it does do this i 
thousands of cases can hardly be denied. 
One powerful motive, then, which tends to th] 
perpetuation of Primogeniture is the desire of t 
Family to preserve for itself a permanent centre
-P-A-G-E-169
CHAP. VIL ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 163 
family life, which will not only facilitate intercourse 
amongst the living members of the Family, but will 
also enable them to maintain their hold upon the 
family spirit and tradition. It fears, and with 
some justice, that division of its property would 
sooner or later bring about its own dissolution. 
Even though its members should achieve individu- 
ally wealth and reputation, yet they would be 
scattered; and without any permanent common 
interest the bonds holding them together in one 
spiritual whole might be weakened. It is the 
power of the living spirit of the past, even more 
than the power of the dead hand of the past, which 
perpetuates the “land-system” of England. 
Another element which enters into the motive, 
land which probably predominates with those who 
set themselves to “found a Family,” is the desire to 
erpetuate one’s own name. There are perhaps few 
ho would not wish to say “non omnis moriar” ; 
ut there are few again who can hope to achieve 
uch personal distinction as will of itself rescue their 
ame from oblivion. They look therefore to their 
hildren to carry on the name, and pass it forward 
hrough successive generations—a lingering relic of 
       
    
   
     
    
        
   
   ts original owners, which may still sound in the ears 
f men long after their visible forms have been 
bliterated. 
But for this they desire not merely the perpetua- 
ion of the name; its actual continuance or extinction 
epends upon whether or not there are sons to bear 
t, and that again has little or nothing to do with the
-P-A-G-E-170
164 THE FAMILY PART I 
possession of property. It is rather that the name 
should continue to be well known, to be often spoken, 
to carry weight, and that the bearer of it should by 
that very fact be influential amongst his neighbours 
and contemporaries ; and the kind of influence desired 
is one which naturally attaches itself to the possession 
of land. In former days such possession carried with 
it, to a large extent, actual proprietary rights over 
the people occupying the land; and even at the 
present day the position of the landowner gives him 
an influence over those who live upon his estate 
which he could rarely acquire in any other way. 
Moreover, the possession of land ensures the con- 
tinued influence of the Family in one neighbour- 
hood; and in England at any rate it generally 
ensures the actual, if sometimes intermittent, pre- 
sence of the Family there. Now, there is nothin: 
so fatal to prestige and influence, especially if tha 
prestige and influence have no very solid basis o 
intrinsic merit, as change of surroundings. Th 
newcomer in a place not only depends upon his ow: 
merits for any influence he is to achieve; he ma 
have long to wait before a chance presents itself o 
manifesting those merits. Hence a Family whic 
leaves its home may fall into obscurity merel; 
because in its new surroundings it has no weigh 
of tradition and familiarity to keep it befor 
men’s minds. The policy therefore of the man wh 
desires to found a Family is to attach it as firml 
as possible to some definite portion of land whic 
may serve to perpetuate the prestige of the famil
-P-A-G-E-171
CHAP. VIL ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 165 
name irrespective of the merits of any particular 
representative. 
And given the end in view, the means adopted 
seem at any rate to afford the best chance of success. 
It is no doubt a loftier ideal that one’s descendants 
should maintain the family influence by pre-eminence 
in their various vocations; and there is no doubt 
either that the family influence would thus be far 
more widely spread. But to the unimaginative eye 
of the ancestor there is something too intangible 
about an influence which he cannot foresee in all its 
details, and for which there may be “nothing to 
show” which will compare in concreteness with his 
own power over his tenants or his trees. Moreover, 
ven though he be a man of ability himself, he has 
o means of ensuring that his ability shall be passed 
m to his descendants, or even to his own son. 
rimogeniture fails him and settlements are of no 
vail when the property consists in personal qualities, 
nd he sees no certainty of rescuing his name from 
blivion but by attaching it to the soil through the 
edium of his eldest son. 
But the question is complicated, and has been 
om the first, by the problem of the younger 
rothers. To them belongs the line of ancestors, 
e family spirit, the old traditions, in no less a 
egree than to the first-born; and it has always 
een felt necessary to justify the preference of the 
dest as being in some way conducive to the 
terests of the others. It is in the attempt to
-P-A-G-E-172
166 THE FAMILY PART 1 
meet this difficulty that the interests of the feudal 
Family have most often tended to conflict with the 
interests of the community at large; while at the 
same time it is in the younger brothers that we find 
the natural transition to the essentially modern 
Family of to-day. 
The original theory and practice was, as we have 
seen, that the eldest born held the estate in trust for 
the younger members of the Family, and was expected 
to provide for them out of it or upon it; and this 
practice has continued longest where the family pro- 
perty is regarded as a business which all take their 
part in working. The difficulty first becomes acute 
when the property is expected to maintain the Family 
without any return on their part, and it is found 
sooner or later wherever there is an aristocracy which 
disdains to work for its living. The following story 
from Xenophon’s Memorabilia shows how old is the 
troublesome question of the “ poor relation” who i 
genteel as well as poor; and it shows also a ver 
practical method of solving the difficulty. Socrate: 
noticing one day that Aristarchus looked gloomy, 
asked him if he was in trouble. He answered 
“ Yes, Socrates, I am in sore straits indeed. Eve 
since the party strife declared itself in the city, wha 
with the rush of people to Pirzeus, and the whole 
sale banishments, I have been fairly at the mercy 
my poor deserted female relatives. Sisters, niece 
cousins, they have all come flocking to me for prote 
tion. I have fourteen free-born souls under my sing] 
roof, and how are we to live? We can get nothin
-P-A-G-E-173
  CHAP. VII ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 167 
out of the soil—that is in the hands of the enemy ; 
nothing from my house property, for there is scarcely 
a living soul left in the city; my furniture? no one 
will buy it; money? there is none to be borrowed— 
you would have a better chance to find it by looking 
for it on the road than to borrow it from a banker. 
Yes, Socrates, to stand by and see one’s relatives die 
of hunger is hard indeed, and yet to feed so many at 
such a pinch impossible.” 
Socrates then proceeds to remind Aristarchus that 
other citizens with households quite as large not only 
manage with the aid of their industry to feed them, 
but also to make a large profit. Is it because they 
are better educated in useful arts than Aristarchus’ 
relatives? Aristarchus assures him that, on the con- 
trary, his relatives are quite as capable, but that 
the others are barbarians, while “my kinswomen are 
-free-born ladies.” ‘“ Then,” asks Socrates, “ on the 
ground that they are free-born and your kinswomen, 
you think that they ought to do nothing but eat and 
sleep?” And he presses home the folly of a life spent 
in genteel idleness: “Do human beings in general 
attain to well-tempered manhood by a course of 
idling, or by careful attention to what will be of use ? 
Which will help a man the more to grow in justness 
and uprightness—to be up and doing, or to sit with 
folded hands revolving the ways and means of exist- 
ence? As things stand, I expect there is no love lost 
between you. You cannot help feeling that they are 
costly to you, and they must see that you find them 
a burthen.”
-P-A-G-E-174
  168 THE FAMILY PART I 
Aristarchus is convinced of the wisdom of Socrates’ 
argument, and borrows money to start manufactures. 
“A capital was provided ; wools were purchased ; the 
goodman’s relatives set to work, and even whilst they 
breakfasted they worked, and on and on till work was 
ended and they supped. Smiles took the place of 
frowns ; they no longer looked askance with suspicion, 
but full into each other’s eyes with happiness. They 
loved their kinsman for his kindness to them. He 
became attached to them as helpmates.” And so the 
incident of “ distressed gentlewomen ” closes. 
It is to be feared that, with our modern forms of 
industry and the greater complexity of the business. 
world, there are few Heads of Families who would 
find themselves capable of organising their dependent 
relations into an industrial community; while the 
unpractical education of our gentlewomen leaves the 
majority of them hopelessly incapable of earning a 
living. Moreover, there has perhaps never been a 
time in England when a Family of the feudal or 
aristocratic type would not have regarded such an 
expedient for maintaining itself as unsuited to its 
dignity and position. Yet many a great Family has 
sunk into obscurity which might have flourished with 
increased prosperity if its members had not taken it 
as a matter of course that they were to be maintained 
in idleness. But sons and daughters have had to be 
provided for, so long as the power of doing so remained, 
and we must describe briefly what have been the 
actual expedients resorted to, so far as they are known.
-P-A-G-E-175
CHAP. VII ON YOUNGER BROTHERS GO}: 
In the early days of feudalism in England there 
was little property of any kind except land,’ and 
therefore practically no means of making provision 
for the younger children out of capital. The 
daughters seem to have been less of a problem than 
the sons. Then, as now, there was always the 
prospect of marriage, and in those days it was the 
business of the subjects of the feudal lord to provide 
the dowry for his daughters; while if they did not 
marry, they might either occupy a corner in the old 
home when it had descended to the eldest son, or find 
a last refuge in the cloister. 
But the younger sons were less easily bestowed. 
In the days of fighting, the strength of the Family 
would depend not a little upon their strong arms, and 
if they were to be firmly attached to the family for- 
tunes, then proper provision must be made for them. 
If the Family was great in the land and the estates 
large, it was common for some of the younger mem- 
bers to hold a part of them under the chief by the 
system known as “ subinfeudation.” For others there 
were rich bishoprics, abbeys, and churches ; and others 
would enter into military service, or become soldiers 
of fortune. Or again, some would become judges, 
and (Brentano thinks) would use their influence in 
that capacity to undermine the power of Primo- 
geniture. 
But in 1290 subinfeudation was made illegal, in 
the interests of the great lords who lost their rights 
to the dues and services attaching to the land when 
1 Brentano, p. 183.
-P-A-G-E-176
170 THE FAMILY PART I 
their tenants sublet it. The land must either be sold 
outright, in which case the new tenant would owe 
allegiance direct to the feudal lord, or not divided 
at all. But the introduction of entails prevented 
the complete alienation of any portion of the family 
estate in the interests of the younger brothers; and 
it would indeed have been contrary to the whole 
policy of the time. An aristocracy which depends 
for its influence upon landed property can only 
maintain its distinction by means of a system of 
Primogeniture or some modification of it. It is 
said that at the end of the fifteenth century there 
were in Brittany no less than twenty-five thousand 
nobles leading the lives of peasants upon diminu- 
tive estates which were constantly being further 
subdivided.’ And it can hardly be maintained that 
the English landowners were, from their own point of 
view, ill-advised in attempting to avoid such a fate 
for their descendants. Moreover, it was by main- 
taining the family influence intact in one strong hand 
that lucrative posts were obtained for the younger 
brothers in Church and State, and the Family was 
enabled to maintain its pre-eminence as a whole. So 
long as promotion in the various professions depended 
upon family influence it is probable that, generally 
speaking, the younger brothers benefited—if not as 
greatly as the elder—yet more than they would have 
done under the system of division. Bacon, as we 
have seen, attacked Primogeniture on the ground 
that it was fatal to the proper upbringing of the 
1 Demolins, Les Frangais d'aujourd’ hui, p. 413.
-P-A-G-E-177
CHAP. VII ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 171 
eldest son, whose moral character was undermined 
by his certainty of succession. Sir Matthew Hale 
defends it on the correlative ground that, while it 
sacrifices the eldest son to a life of dignified leisure, 
the younger sons are forced to distinguish themselves 
in active life; and since his time the argument that 
it is the younger sons who really benefit by Primo- 
geniture has frequently been repeated, Sometimes it 
is on the ground of character: by making an eldest 
son, it is said, you ensure that there is “only one 
fool in the family ” ; and there is just so much of truth 
in the paradox that it undoubtedly is easier for the 
man who must work to lead a useful life, than it is 
for the man who can choose whether he will work or 
not. The civilised world still wavers between two 
theories of education: the one, that life should be 
made easy; the other, that life should be left hard. 
The student of peoples, the sociologist or economist, 
sees that strength and progress are best attained by 
the people who can only maintain themselves by 
strenuous effort, and instances are not unknown of 
attempts to create artificial hardships as a spur to 
indolent races.’ But the father who is far-seeing 
and strong-minded enough to choose this method of 
dealing with his younger sons as a deliberate policy, 
will hardly fail to give his first-born also the advan- 
tage of it. 
1 “Last century it was proposed by several economists that the chestnut 
trees of Corsica should be done away with, in order that the inhabitants 
might be forced to work ; and for two years at the end of the eighteenth 
century it was actually prohibited to plant fresh trees of this species” 
(Demolins, Les Frangais daujowrd’ hui, p. 174).  
-P-A-G-E-178
172 THE FAMILY PART I 
Generally speaking, however, the argument that 
Primogeniture is for the benefit of the younger sons 
has been based upon an economic rather than an 
ethical principle. It is the family influence, main- 
tained by accumulating the wealth of the Family 
in the hands of one man, which is to secure the for- 
tunes of the younger brothers, either by establishing 
them in comfortable sinecures with assured incomes, 
or by opening out to them a career where even a 
moderate amount of energy and ability must reap a 
rich harvest. And this function of Primogeniture 
has extended beyond the days of feudalism in its 
stricter sense. Brentano speaks of the eighteenth 
century as “the time of political corruption, of 
sinecures, of the distribution of richly endowed places 
in the Church, the civil service, and the army, not 
according to merit, but according to family connec- 
tions . . . the eldest son inherited the estate; the 
inheritance of the younger sons consisted in the well- 
paid places and sinecures in Church and State.” 
In the first quarter of the nineteenth century much 
the same system prevailed or was thought to prevail. 
Writing in 1832, Colonel Perronet Thompson says: “On 
the law of Primogeniture there is no necessity to insist 
upon the fact, that ten thousand a year in the hands 
of one son would only be a thousand a year apiece in 
the hands of ten, and that this would not make the 
sum more than it was before.t But, in the first place, 
there is the direct consequence that the nine junior 
sons are injured by the rule; and, in the next, there 
1 He is referring to Chalmers’s argument, quoted below. 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  CHAP. VII ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 173 
is the indirect consequence—of vastly greater con- 
sequence to the public than the other—that the 
influence and power thus created in the hands of the 
eldest brother are employed to procure a maintenance 
for the younger brothers out of the pockets of the 
public. This is clearly the end and the organised 
plan of the system of Primogeniture : the ten thou- 
sand a year is to be concentrated in the hands of the 
eldest son, that it may act as a battering ram for 
procuring a thousand a year for each of the others, or 
as much of it as may be found practicable, by entry 
into the public pantry and appropriation of the 
victual that is therein” (Ewercises, vol. ii. p. 177). 
This theory of the deliberate organisation of Primo- 
geniture seems to be derived by the author from an 
article in a French newspaper previously quoted by 
him, which reflects the whole spirit of the French 
Revolution in the view it takes of the English hier- 
archy: “The exercise of aristocratical power being 
attached to the possession of great landed property, 
it is easy to see that younger brothers can have no 
share in the real estate which may be left by their 
relatives at their decease. The descendants of an 
artistocratic family would, in fact, all sink into the 
ranks of the common people if they were to divide 
what is left by their relatives in equal shares. The 
eldest son therefore keeps to himself all the landed 
property, to which is attached the exercise of aristo- 
cratic power; and then he makes use of this power 
to get money for his younger brothers, at the expense 
of the working classes. It is a mistake to imagine
-P-A-G-E-180
} 
174 THE FAMILY den I 
that in England all the property of a family in the 
higher orders goes exclusively to the eldest son. It 
is true he takes the landed property, which is ex- 
clusively the family estate. But the younger brothers 
have for their share rich livings in the Church, sine- 
cures or places of some kind which the public is 
obliged to pay for; and all these are considered as 
part of the family property as much as the other. 
For there can never be too much pains taken to 
impress the fact, that the higher orders consider 
themselves as having a property, not only in the 
landed estates which they possess by direct title, but 
in the working classes besides, on whom they lay 
taxes as they please, and share the proceeds amongst 
themselves.” * 
There is a ring of class hatred about this not 
unnatural in a French writer at a time when the 
democratic principle was still struggling for existence 
against the reintroduction of the aristocracy ; but it 
is, of course, a very inadequate analysis of a very 
complex society. So far as the younger brothers are 
concerned—and it is they in whom we are at present 
interested—it describes a system which had been so 
long rooted in English society that it had come to be 
regarded as natural and inevitable, and it was perhaps 
areal service to call attention to it, even by means 
of exaggeration. The evils inherent in the system 
had only been obvious in cases of glaring incom- 
petency, while it might be argued with some show of 
truth that the educated sons of the upper classes were 
1 Quoted by Perronet Thompson, vol. i. pp. 176-77. 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
CHAP, VII ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 175 
likely to be at least as competent for the public 
service as any others. But as education ceased to be 
confined to the upper classes the argument lost what 
force it might have had; while it became continually 
more obvious that for special services special training 
was needed of a kind not necessarily included in the 
ordinary education of a gentleman. Special and 
arduous training is incumbent to-day in most branches 
of the public service, irrespective of the rank of the 
aspirant ; but under the Stuarts flagrant incompetency 
was no bar to the holding of lucrative posts in Army 
and Navy: “In the year 1672 the French Government 
determined to educate young men of good family from 
a very early age, especially for the sea service. But 
the English Government, instead of following this 
excellent example, not only continued to distribute 
high naval commands among landsmen, but selected 
for such commands landsmen who, even on land, could 
not safely have been put in any important trust. 
Any lad of noble birth, any dissolute courtier for 
whom one of the King’s mistresses would speak a 
word, might hope that a ship of the line, and with it 
the honour of the country and the lives of hundreds 
of brave men, would be committed to his care. It 
mattered not that he had never in his life taken a 
voyage except on the Thames, that he could not keep 
his feet in a breeze, that he did not know the difference 
between latitude and longitude. No previous training 
was thought necessary.” * 
The good things of the Church have generally been

-P-A-G-E-182
    176 THE FAMILY PART I 
regarded as peculiarly liable to appropriation by the 
younger members and dependants of noble families , 
but there was a considerable period in the history of 
the Church when it afforded comparatively few lucra- 
tive positions, and it speaks ill for the disinterestedness 
of her service that during that period it was held to 
be unfitting the consideration of a gentleman except 
in the higher ranks of dignitaries. 
“The place of the clergyman in society had been 
completely changed by the Reformation. Before that 
event, ecclesiastics had formed the majority of the 
House of Lords, had, in wealth and splendour, equalled, 
and sometimes outshone, the greatest of the temporal 
barons, and had generally held the highest civil offices. 
Many of the Treasurers, and almost all the Chancel- 
lors of the Plantagenets were Bishops. The Lord 
Keeper of the Privy Seal and the Master of the Rolls | 
were ordinarily Churchmen. Churchmen transacted 
the most important diplomatic business. Indeed, all 
that large portion of the administration which rude 
and warlike nobles were incompetent to conduct was 
considered as especially belonging to divines. Men, 
therefore, who were averse to the life of camps, and 
who were, at’ the same time, desirous to rise in the 
State, commonly received the tonsure. Among them 
were sons of all the most illustrious families, and 
near kinsmen of the throne, Scroops and Nevilles, 
Bourchiers, Staffords and Poles. To the religious 
houses belonged the rents of immense domains, and 
all that large portion of the tithe which is now in the 
hands of laymen. Down to the middle of the reign 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
CHAP. VII ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 177 
of Henry the Eighth, therefore, no line of life was so 
attractive to ambitious and covetous natures as the 
priesthood. Then came a violent revolution. The aboli- 
tion of the monasteries deprived the Church at once of 
the greater part of her wealth, and of her predominance 
in the Upper House of Parliament. . . . The clergy 
had lost the ascendency which is the natural reward 
of superior mental cultivation. . . . The spiritual 
character not only ceased to be a qualification for high 
civil office, but began to be regarded as a disqualifica- 
tion. Those worldly motives, therefore, which had 
formerly induced so many able, aspiring, and high- 
born youths to assume the ecclesiastical habit, ceased 
to operate. Not one parish in two hundred then 
afforded what a man of family considered as a main- 
tenance. There were still, indeed, prizes in the 
Church; but they were few, and even the highest 
were mean, when compared with the glory which had 
       
             
        once surrounded the princes of the hierarchy. .. . 
Thus the sacerdotal office lost its attraction for the 
higher classes. During the century which followed 
the accession of Elizabeth scarce a single person of 
noble descent took orders. At the close of the reign 
lof Charles the Second two sons of Peers were Bishops, 
four or five sons of Peers were Priests, and held valu- 
lable preferments; but these rare exceptions did not 
take away the reproach which lay on the body. The 
clergy were regarded as, on the whole, a plebeian 
lass; and, indeed, for one who made the figure of a 
entleman, ten were mere menial servants.” * 
1 Macaulay, History of England, vol. i.
-P-A-G-E-184
178 THE FAMILY PART I 
It would be interesting to trace the process by 
which the Church became once more rehabilitated 
as a suitable profession for “younger sons,” and 
pleasant to think that the period of probation had 
led directly to a more disinterested service. But that 
was not to come till later. Macaulay attributes the 
change in its first stages to purely mercenary causes : 
“Tn the eighteenth century the great increase in the 
value of benefices produced a change. The younger 
sons of the nobility were allured back to the clerical 
profession. Warburton, in a letter to Hurd, dated 
the 5th of July 1752, mentions this change, which 
was then recent: ‘Our grandees have at last found 
their way back into the Church. I only wonder 
they have been so long about it. But be as- 
sured that nothing but a new religious revolution, 
to sweep away the fragments that Henry the Eighth 
left after banqueting his courtiers, will drive them 
out again.’” 
But though the increasing wealth might once more 
attract the younger sons, it seems to have been long 
before the office of clergyman completely regained 
its social estimation. Readers of Miss Austen will 
remember how the worldly heroine of Mansfield Park) 
reproached the younger son, whose father had pro- 
cured him a comfortable living, with the prospect o 
a better one to follow. ‘Oh, no doubt he is very 
sincere in preferring an income ready made to th 
trouble of working for one, and has the best intentio 
of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat, 
drink, and grow fat. It is indolence, Mr. Bertram 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
CHAP, VII ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 179 
indeed. Indolence and love of ease—a want of all 
laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or 
of inclination to take the trouble of being agree- 
able, which make men clergymen. A _ clergy- 
man has nothing to do but to be slovenly and 
selfish —read the newspaper, watch the weather, 
and quarrel with his wife. His curate does all 
the work, and the business of his own life is to 
dine.” 
But Miss Austen’s gentle irony, contrasted as it is 
with the loftier view which the hero himself takes of 
his profession, is only a faint reflection of the bitter 
contempt and antagonism which accompanied the 
awakening of the democratic spirit in England. It is 
worth while to illustrate this phase of feeling further, 
partly because of the influence it could hardly fail to 
have upon the fortunes of the younger brothers of 
bo-day, and partly to emphasise the magnitude of the 
hange which has taken place. Every generation has 
me or more of the men who make it their difficult 
nd ungracious task to expose to the public gaze 
buses which are apt to pass unnoticed except by 
hose who benefit by them. This they may do with 
jhe moderation which carries conviction, or with the 
vective which makes the disinterested reader suspect 
ven the integrity of statistics. That the writer of 
lhe Extraordinary Black Book (1831) is not free 
om prejudice seems obvious, but it is impossible to 
uestion the basis of truth in his accusations, “One 
f the greatest abuses in the disposal of patronage,” 
e writes, “is monopoly in a few individuals of
-P-A-G-E-186
180 THE FAMILY PART ] 
influence and connection, sharing among them the 
most valuable emoluments of the Church. In all 
spiritual offices and dignities there is great difference 
in value, and also in patronage; and the great object 
of ecclesiastical-intrigue is to secure not only the most 
valuable, but the greatest number of preferments. 
Hence arises the present disposition of Church pro- 
perty. Scarcely any preferment is held single, the 
sees, dignities, rectories, and vicarages being mostly 
held with other good things, and the most monopolised 
by the relations and connections of those who have 
the disposal of them, namely, the Crown, the Bishops, 
and Aristocracy. The bishops are frequently arch- 
deacons and deans, rectors, vicars, and curates, besides 
holding professorships, clerkships, prebends, precentor- 
ships, and other offices in cathedrals. Their sons, 
sons-in-law, brothers, and nephews are also pushed in 
to the most valuable preferments in the diocese.” 
He then quotes the case of a bishop, who with his 
son and son-in-law held twelve offices and preferments, 
to the value of £31,645. Again: “The late Arch 
bishop Sutton is an eminent instance of the perversion 
of ecclesiastical patronage. The Suttons remainin; 
in the Church are very numerous; among seven 0 
them are shared sixteen rectories, vicarages, an 
chapelries, besides preacherships and dignities i 
Cathedrals. Of the eleven daughters of the Archbisho 
several had the prudence to marry men in holy orders 
who soon became amply endowed. Hugh Percy, so 
of the Earl of Beverley, married one daughter, and i 
the course of about as many years was portioned o:
-P-A-G-E-187
  CHAP. VII ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 181 
with eight different preferments, estimated to be 
worth £10,000 per annum.” * 
It is not only the appropriation of Church prefer- 
ment by the aristocracy which arouses the indignation 
of our author; he denounces the whole system of 
Primogeniture out of which it has arisen. “ Other 
evils result from this feudal institution. Primogeni- 
ture enriches one, and leaves all the other members 
of a family destitute. Hence they are thrown, like 
mendicants, on the public for support; but they are 
unlike mendicants in this, that the public has no 
option whether they will support them or not. The 
aristocracy, usurping the power of the State, have 
the means, under various pretexts, of extorting for 
              
    
      
    
    
    the junior branches of their families a forced subsist- 
lence. They patronise a ponderous and_ sinecure 
church establishment; they wage long and unneces- 
sary wars to create employments in the army and 
avy ; they conquer and retain useless colonies; they 
et on foot expensive missions of diplomacy, and keep 
m ambassador or consul, and often both, at almost 
very petty State and petty port in the world; they 
reate offices without duties, grant unmerited pensions, 
eep up unnecessary places in the royal household, in 
he admiralty, the treasury, the customs, excise, courts 
f law, and every department of the public adminis- 
ration; by these and other expedients the junior as 
ell as elder branches of the great families are 
mply provided for out of the taxes. They live 
n profusion and luxury, and those by whom they

are maintained alone subsist in indigence and 
privation.” * 
It would probably be hard to find in any section 
of the community to-day a feeling of resentment to 
equal this, with its incapacity to distinguish between 
the persistence of old customs and traditions and 
deliberate and designing selfishness. The constitution 
of our whole social fabric and the iniquities of the 
capitalist are now the objects against which the 
reformer launches his invectives; and though Primo- 
geniture still prevails, and younger brothers still have 
to be provided for, we hear little of the abuses of 
privilege and influence. The change has come about 
without any revolution such as Warburton predicted, 
but is none the less real because due to the pressure 
of public opinion and a deeper sense of responsibility. 
The very means by which the reform has bee     
      
   
         
   achieved is now falling into disrepute, so far has th 
old state of things fallen into oblivion. Much hai 
been said of late against the prevalence of the syste 
of examination, and its ineffectiveness as a means 0 
selecting the best men; and yet it is chiefly by means 
of examination that the professions and public 
appointments have been removed from the deadenin, 
influence of patronage, and more or less thrown ope 
to all classes. 
Before passing to conjecture what becomes o 
“younger sons,” now that they can no longer rel 
solely upon family influence, it is interesting to not 
the more thoughtful and less one-sided view taken b 
1 The Extraordinary Black Book, p. 202.
-P-A-G-E-189
  CHAP, VII ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 183 
some writers of the situation at the beginning of the 
last century. Malthus, writing in 1820, says: “If 
from the abolition of the law of primogeniture the 
landed fortunes were all very inconsiderable, it is not 
probable that there would be many large capitals 
among merchants, and in this case much productive 
power would unquestionably be lost.” (His argument 
is that merchants are led on to accumulate wealth by 
their desire to compete with the large landed pro- 
prietor, perhaps an unnecessarily subtle way both of 
accounting for the merchant’s activity and of justify- 
ing the landed proprietor.) ‘But however this may 
be, it is certain that a very large body of what may 
be called the middle classes of society has been 
established in this country, while the law of primo- 
geniture, by forcing the younger sons of the nobility 
and great landed proprietors into the higher division 
of these classes, has, for all practical purposes, anni- 
hilated the distinctions founded on rank and birth, and 
opened the fairest arena for the contests of personal 
merit in all the avenues to wealth and knowledge. 
It is probable that the obligations generally imposed 
upon younger sons to be the founders of their own 
fortunes has imposed a greater degree of energy and 
activity into professional and commercial exertions 
than would have taken place if property in land had 
been more equally divided.” * 
It is difficult to reconcile this view of the annihila- 
tion of distinction founded upon birth and rank with 
the state of patronage at the time when it was written, 
1 Pol. Economy, p. 879.
-P-A-G-E-190
184 THE FAMILY PART I 
and it is doubtful whether for generations to come it 
can really be the case that the lad of obscure birth 
will have as good a chance in starting on his career 
as the lad of “ good family.” It is much gained that 
he has @ chance; but the mere fact that his friends 
and family are unfamiliar with the circumstances and 
details of life in the higher professional ranks will 
place him at a disadvantage as compared with the 
lad whose friends have for generations been engaged 
in similar work, and who know every detail of what 
is open to him, and how he must set about preparing 
himself. 
Another writer, the famous Dr. Chalmers, pro- 
pounds an ingenious scheme for preserving the system 
then in force (1832), while yet depriving it of injustice. 
“We know,” he writes, “that there is a mighty force 
of sentiment and natural affection arrayed against 
the law of primogeniture. But here is the way in 
which we should appease those feelings and make 
compensation for the violence done to them. We 
would make no inroad on the integrity of estates; or 
for the sake of a second brother take off a portion, to 
the extent of a thousand a year, from that domain of 
ten thousand a year, which devolved by succession on 
the eldest son of the family. We should think it 
vastly better if, by means of a liberal provision in 
all the branches of the public service, a place of a 
thousand a year lay open to the younger son, whether 
in the law, or in the Church, or in colleges, or in the 
army, or in some other well-appointed establishment, 
kept up for the good and interest of the nation. We
-P-A-G-E-191
  CHAP. VII ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 185 
would still have the estate to support the younger 
branches; yet that, not by the violation of its in- 
tegrity, but by a more severe taxation than our 
politicians of the present day have the courage to 
impose. Under the one system the second brother 
would have his thousand a year, but give no return 
for it in any kind of service. Under the other system 
he would also have his thousand a year, and the 
public have the benefit of a duty and service from 
him to the bargain.” But. though the landowners 
are to be heavily taxed to support a service in which 
their younger brothers may find lucrative employ- 
ment, the benefit is not to be confined to these. 
“Tt will not for a moment be imagined, that, while 
we would apportion a much larger amount of the 
nation’s wealth to the objects of public service, we 
contend for any hereditary or family right to that 
portion, on the part of the younger brothers of our 
aristocracy. It should lie open to all the worth and 
talent which may exist in any quarter of society.” 
In short, Chalmers seems to have had in mind some- 
thing not unlike what has actually come about under 
the unintentional combination of the succession duties 
and competitive examinations. _ 
So far, however, as concerns provision for the 
younger brothers, it hardly seems that the heavier 
taxation of the landed proprietor has had the effect 
of increasing the numbers employed in the public 
service. It is difficult to get any accurate or certain 
information as to how far the “younger brothers” of 
the present day are earning a living, or how far they

186 THE FAMILY PART I 
continue to be an unprofitable charge upon the family 
estate, or how far, again, they are provided for in the 
public services by means of family influence rather 
than their own merits. An examination of Burke’s 
Peerage and Baronetage (1899) seems to show that 
comparatively few are in the public services at all. 
The Church, for instance, seems to have fallen again 
into disrepute as a career for the “ younger brother,” 
for out of 867 younger sons born before 1880 we find 
only 30 in holy orders. The army is much more 
popular, and 269 either are serving or have served in 
some military capacity. It must be borne in mind, 
however, that, except in the higher ranks, the pro- 
fession of an officer in the army is not a lucrative 
one, and that the majority of those who follow it 
must be regarded rather as volunteers than as bur- 
dens upon the public funds. The remaining services 
fare little better than the Church. The following 
table sets out the occupations (as stated in the Peer- 
age) of eldest and younger sons respectively :—

The most striking feature about this table is the large 
proportion of younger sons who are represented as 
having no calling. It is hardly to be supposed that 
both they and their still more numerous sisters are all 
of them living entirely at the charge of the family 
estate; and the more sanguine view to take is, that 
many of them have entered into the arena of profes- 
sional or commercial life in capacities which are not 
considered sufficiently dignified for the pages of a 
Peerage. It is certainly remarkable that so few 
should be entered as having pursued other than the 
conventional lines. Wealthy marriages no doubt 
account for some; and even in the case of the 
genuinely “unemployed” it must not be assumed 
that none of them are rendering services in exchange 
for their maintenance. The greater part of the local 
and imperial government of the country is still carried 
on by strenuous voluntary work, and of this work a 
considerable part is done by members of the “ leisured” 
class. 
It is probable that if we were able to push the 
inquiry further and examine the families of those
-P-A-G-E-194
  188 THE FAMILY PART I 
“landed gentry” who are not of sufficient rank to be 
admitted into the Peerage, nor wealthy enough to 
have been made baronets, we should find a much 
larger proportion of younger sons who have been 
stimulated by their position into eminence in profes- 
sional or commercial pursuits. So far as this is the 
case, and so far as they owe their success more to 
their own abilities and enterprise than to patronage 
and influence, they are typical rather of the Modern 
Family, the characteristics and functions of which 
will occupy the remainder of this book. 
But the most characteristic survivals of the feudal 
Family are not the sons but the daughters of the 
house. In feudal days, as we have seen, there were 
three courses only open to them: marriage, the 
cloister, or a corner in the eldest brother’s house. In 
families where the aristocratic tradition still prevails, 
the position is not greatly altered. The main differ- 
ence is, that at the death of the father it is more 
usual now for the unmarried daughters, like the 
younger sons, to receive their portions and to seek a 
life of their own instead of lingering on in the ancestral 
home. For many of them, in the absence of either 
family cares or professional work, their solitary lives 
are little less confined and narrow than they would 
have been in a convent; and it is perhaps not 
wonderful that this generation has devised a modern- 
ised form of the convent in the great Anglican sister- 
hoods, where so many women now seek an imitation 
of the family and industrial life which they fail to 
find in the real world. In the modern Family of the
-P-A-G-E-195
  CHAP. VII ON YOUNGER BROTHERS 189 
best type the daughters are prepared for a career as 
naturally as the sons, and have no need to seek out 
artificial refuges ; but for women new ideas and new 
principles work always slower than for men, and a 
far larger proportion are still subject to feudal con- 
ditions. In France this is even more strikingly the 
case than in England; although it is true that many 
Frenchwomen have achieved complete and successful 
economic freedom, the numbers who are still in sub- 
jection to traditional convention is very large. “To 
find out what becomes of the French demoiselle we 
must refer to statistics. In 1900 no less than sixty- 
four thousand women were immured for life within 
convent walls,” *

CHAPTER VIII F 
THE BASIS OF THE MODERN FAMILY 
Many of those who are interesting themselves in the 
study of social questions and the structure of society 
at the present day are of opinion that the Family as 
an institution has played its part, and must now 
yield its functions into other hands. They see the 
change which has come over its organisation in many 
places only as the change of dissolution; they fix 
their attention upon the type to which Le Play gave 
the name of the “unstable Family,’ and note its 
degeneracy, and fail to recognise that it is in no 
sense representative of the modern Family in its 
true and most characteristic type. 
This distinction between the degenerate, unstable 
Family and the typical modern Family is an& 
essential one. It is not merely a question of how 
long the members of a Family continue to live 
together in one house; superficially the two types 
may be much alike in this respect. It is one of the 
proofs of the strength of the modern Family that it is 
able to send its sons and daughters far over the face 
of the earth without in the least impairing the bond 
which unites them; while it is one of the proofs of 
198 0 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
194 THE FAMILY PART II 
the weakness of the degenerate Family that there is 
no bond to hold them together at all, or a bond 
so slender that removal into the next street is 
enough to sever it. The real nature of the distinc- 
tion can only become clear as we study the charac- 
teristics of the modern Family at its best. 
One aspect of this distinction is illustrated by the 
following quotation from M. Demolins’ Les Frangais 
@aujourdhu: “This type of Family.” (7.e. the un- 
stable) “is the natural product of the disaggregation | 
of family communities. Under the régime of the 
community the tendency is to remain grouped round | 
the land of the Family or the héritier-associé . . . 
under the régime of the unstable Family, the 
children tend to leave the home as soon as possible, 
to establish themselves in separate households. So 
far, this type would seem to be changing towards 
the particularist Family, but it presents one funda- 
mental difference from this. In the particularist 
Family the children have been previously formed to 
suffice for themselves and by themselves, no matter 
in what profession ; to be equal to any situation; to 
undertake with equal energy, and often with equal 
success, the most different kinds of work, whether of 
colonist, manufacturer, or merchant. But in the un- 
stable Family there is no formation energique. They 
are not trained to obedience, to respect of the paternal 
authority, to the spirit of economy, as in the family 
community. Nor are they trained to individual 
initiative, to zeal for work, to progressive methods, 
as in the particularist Families. Thus they leave
-P-A-G-E-201
cH. vit BASIS OF THE MODERN FAMILY 195 
the home without having previously acquired the 
aptitudes necessary to succeed by themselves.” * 
The one characteristic which the essentially modern 
Family has in common with the unstable or broken- 
down Family is, that it is not held together by the 
possession of, or attachment to, a particular piece of 
land. We have sufficiently dwelt upon the enormous 
influence which property in land, however small, has 
upon the organisation of the Family ; we now have 
to consider whether any similar influences remain for 
a people amongst whom property in land has become 
so exceptional as to be practically of no importance. 
Is it the case that when the Family has no property, 
or only property of such a nature that each member 
can if he will walk away with his share in his pocket, 
the Family ceases to be a reality ? or are there other 
forces and connecting links which preserve its     
      
    
   
       
    strength, though under another form ? 
Now the influence of the land, as we have seen, 
is strongest in preserving the unity and continuance 
of the Family when it forms an industrial basis for 
the combined work of the various members of the 
Family. The typical family community is one which 
is held together by a common industry in which each 
ember can partake, according to his strength or 
iffering age or sex is farming and the cultivation 
f land. In it there is work for all capacities; the

can give his strength, and the most able can find 
scope for his skill and organising power. And so it 
becomes possible to carry into industry the principle 
of family life, that each gives according to his powers 
and receives according to his needs. Moreover, and 
this is important for the question before us, this in- 
dustrial unity of the Family means that its members 
are stronger in combination than they would be 
apart; a real gain is effected by the assignment of 
work to those most fitted to do it, and thus there 
is a genuine economic force to hold the Family 
together. 
Is there anything corresponding to this in our 
modern community; any industrial basis for family 
life? or is it true that this kind of co-operation has 
been entirely swept away in a manufacturing country 
such as England ? 
If we look to the landowners themselves it seems 
clear that, in the higher ranks, ab any rate, the land 
no longer affords—if indeed it ever did—an industrial 
basis for the family life; many an old Family which 
s disappeared might have held together muc 
bi oce if its members could have treated their estat 
as a business to be carried on by their own energ 
and capacity. Amongst the farming class I do no 
know how far it may be the case that farming i 
still a family industry ; but it is generally said tha 
} the farmer’s sons and daughters are no more conten 
/ to find their occupation on the farm than the son 
/ of the landed proprietor to carry on the business o 
oe estate. But amongst agricultural labourers thi

cH. vot BASIS OF THE MODERN FAMILY 197, 
case is somewhat different. It still remains true that 
the land demands such variety of work as is most 
readily afforded by the Family, and the man whose 
Family contains a certain number of women and lads ~| 
stands a better chance of getting work, or will get 
better work, than the solitary man who has only 
his own labour to offer. “In Northumberland and 
Durham a great many women are employed at work 
in the fields. They are usually the daughters of the 
men who are hired by the year, the system being for 
the farm servants to be hired by families, the sons 
and daughters living with their parents in cottages 
let free and situated on the farm, and all working on 
the same farm. Men with daughters who are able to 
work are always sought after, and a man with several 
daughters can command a higher wage than a man 
who has none.”* Thus there is still a definite 
economic inducement to the members of the agri- 
cultural Family to hold together; there is an in- 
dustrial basis. If the movement towards small 
holdings should happily continue to gain force in 
England, it is probable that amongst small holders 
also the Family will become a genuinely industrial 
community, finding occupation of various kinds for 
its members in the management of the holding. This 
is notably so in the Channel Islands, where much of 
he land is held by small proprietors and very highly 
ultivated. ‘ 
The first step away from the agricultural family we é 
ommunity is found where the industry is not 
1 Report on Wages of Agricultural Labourers, 1905, p. 14.
-P-A-G-E-204
  198 THE FAMILY PART II 
sufficient to occupy all members of the Family 
profitably, and some are employed as wage-earners 
outside, though their earnings are still contributed 
to the common stock. This is generally the case 
where the Family is within reach of some manu- 
facturing or mining centre, and may mean a much 
more prosperous condition than where it is de- 
pendent upon agricultural pursuits alone. One 
great advantage of it is, that it combines the 
advantages of city with those of country life, 
ensures a country upbringing for the children, 
and keeps open the possibility of country pursuits 
for those members of the Family who are more 
fitted for them. I believe that on the Continent 
this combination of town and country life is 
common; in England the best chance of attaining 
it would seem to lie in the removal of industries 
from the great centres of population into the 
country. 
In the days of “ domestic industry ” this industrial 
co-operation of the Family was common in manu- 
facture as well as in agriculture; and all its 
members would be engaged under the control of its 
head in the production of some article of commerce. 
But it is seldom that any manufacture can afford th 
same variety of occupation as in agriculture, th 
co-operation would be of a less effective nature, an 
it was easily broken down when machinery and stea: 
power made it profitable to organise the workers int 
great armies, banded together into groups where th
-P-A-G-E-205
  cu. vit BASIS OF THE MODERN FAMILY 199 
individuals are repetitions of each other instead of 
being complementary factors. It was perhaps in- 
evitable that such a widespread shifting in the 
industrial grouping of the people should, for a 
time and to a limited extent, have shaken the 
Family itself; but it is no longer true, at any rate 
in England, that the unstable Family with its 
derelicts is mainly to be found amongst the manu- 
facturing people. The family group has, on the 
whole, successfully withstood the shock of the change 
and reorganised itself on another basis. 
Where domestic industry still lingers, mainly 
amongst the “sweated” industries, we find the 
family co-operation persisting, but in a ae ae 
form, and consisting for the most part in th 
employment of children at work which is in no 
sense especially adapted to their strength and 
powers. But there is one most important branch 
of industrial co-operation which still prevails in 
the great majority of Families in nearly all ranks 
of society ; it is that which assigns to the wife the 
function of manager and spender of the family in- 
come and the care of the home and children, while 
the husband and adult children take the responsi- 
bility of providing the income. It is an arrangement » 
which is sometimes abandoned at both extremes of ( 
society ; wealthy women will sometimes devolve their | 
functions upon housekeepers, nurses, and governesses ; 
poor women will sometimes abandon them to become 
wage-earners themselves. But the belief is very 
strong, and is probably justified, that in such a  
-P-A-G-E-206
  200 THE FAMILY PART II 
~ the efficiency of the Family is always liable to be 
impaired, and generally is greatly impaired; and it 
is certain that where the wife abandons the home 
for outside work or pleasure the bonds which hold 
_the Family together become of the slightest. But 
I believe that amongst the wage-earners at any rate 
there is an increasing tendency for women to devote 
themselves more exclusively to the work of house- 
keeping. Generally speaking, they expect to have, 
and they get, the entire management of the family 
income ; in many cases determining even the amount 
which the wage-earners—husbands, sons, and daughters 
alike—may reserve for their own use before handing 
over the money to her. And both they and their 
husbands know that their services in the home are 
far more valuable, even from an economic point of 
view, than if they were themselves earning. I 
cannot refrain from quoting in this context the 
saying of a poor woman of whom Miss Loane writes 
in her beautiful book, The Queen’s Poor. \ She had 
allowed herself to be forced into the position of 
wage-earner: “T’ll regret it once, and that’s all my 
life . . . there’s only one rule for women who want 
to have a decent home for their children and them- 
selves. If your husband comes home erying, and 
says he can’t find any work, sit down on the other 
side of the fire and cry till he does.” 
In the course of an inquiry amongst the secretaries 
of Trade Unions I have come across one great industry 
in which a simple type of family co-operation prevails 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
  cu. vir BASIS OF THE MODERN FAMILY 201 
to a very large extent. Amongst coal-miners in 
many districts it is almost universally customary for 
fathers and sons to work together; and men who 
have sons to co-operate with them are considered to 
have a distinct economic advantage over men who 
have not. There may be different reasons for this 
in different parts of the country; in some places it 
is a housing question, in others no reason is given 
for the fact, which is simply stated. In Derbyshire 
“a man with sons will get employed easier than a 
    
    
    
   
   
     
   
     
   man without.” In Northumberland a man with 
working sons will more readily get employment 
than a man without sons working: “In this district 
the miner has a free house and fire coal. But as 
there is not a sufticient number of these free houses 
for the number of workmen employed, the man with 
working sons always gets the first house vacant.” 
In Cumberland the advantage seems to be due to a 
different cause: “ Fathers may obtain a considerable 
advantage by their sons if they take them with them 
jas co-partners, which is generally done. The colliery 
company might only pay a lad 3s. a day for a job, 
land if the father is a good skilled workman he might 
ake the son with him, and they might earn two ful] 
en’s wages, which is often done.” In South Wales, 
gain, co-operation between fathers and sons is very 
argely the custom. 
So far as I have been able to trace, there is no 
ther considerable industry in which co-operation in 
jhe same work exists as a force to hold the members  
-P-A-G-E-208
  202 THE FAMILY PART II 
of a Family together. But if we pass now from this 
industrial co-operation, we find another kind of co- 
operation, which I will call, to distinguish it from the 
former, economic, and which is so prevalent amongst 
English wage-earners as to be typical at any rate of 
a very large section. I refer to. the co-operation 
which consists in contributions from the wage-earners 
of the Family towards the maintenance of the common 
household. The earnings may be derived from entirely 
different sources, the wage-earners may be working at 
different trades, or at the same trade, but they have 
a common end in view—the maintenance of the 
Family in a state of efficiency. It is very far from 
being the case that in a typical working-class Family 
the children leave the home as soon as they are able 
to support themselves. Whenever we get a collec- 
              
   
     tion of genuine family histories, as distinct from bald 
statements of “man’s earnings,’ we find numerous 
instances where there are children of working age 
living at home and contributing their share towards 
the maintenance of younger and older members ; 
the Family thus fulfilling one of its true economic 
functions of utilising the strong to support th 
weak. A few typical cases may be cited in illus+ 
tration of this position—the first two are take 
from the Budgets published by the Economic Clu 
in 1896, the others from Schulze Gaevernitz’ 
History of the Cotton Industry :-— 
1. Man and wife, son of 22 contributing 15s. 
daughter of 19 paying for her board, son of 17 con 
tributing 6s., daughter of 18 not earning.
-P-A-G-E-209
  cu. vat BASIS OF THE MODERN FAMILY 203 
2. Man and wife, son of 22 contributing 10s., 
daughter giving 7s., and daughter aged 14 not 
earning. Also two married sons living away who 
are “good and kind,” and two married daughters, 
one of whom delayed marriage several years in 
order to help at home. 
8. Man and wife, and seven children, eldest 18. 
Four are working in the same factory as their father. 
The man’s yearly earnings are £98, the children’s are 
£93, and these together form the family income. 
4, Man and wife, and seven children aged 18 to 
31. Man’s earnings £45, children’s £168. 
5. Man and wife, six children from 14 to 23 
years. Man earns 24s. a week, but is much out of 
work ; the children earn £172 : 4s. in the year. 
6. Next, the family of a miner in Northumber- 
land: man and wife, eight children from 2 to 21; 
income of father £90, of the two eldest sons £97. 
7. Finally, a machine fitter in London: man and 
wife, six children from 6 to 17; man earns £105, the 
older children £45. 
Cases such as these are not exceptional, but 
could be multiplied indefinitely by any one familiar 
with the structure of normal working-class life. The 
co-operation which they illustrate is very strong 
evidence against the alleged disintegration of the 
Family ; can it also be regarded as a positive tie, 
tending to hold the Family together? From one 
point of view it may no doubt be maintained 
that the claims upon the earnings of the young 
people tend rather to drive them away from 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  204 THE FAMILY PART IL 
home; that they naturally prefer a life of inde- 
pendence in which they may spend their whole 
earnings upon their own comfort or pleasures, to 
a life in which the claims of the household must be 
satisfied before any surplus can be applied to personal 
gratification. Numerous cases occur, of course, which 
justify this view to some extent; nevertheless it is 
one-sided, and overlooks a whole range of considera- 
tions which affect human nature far more deeply than 
the mere desire for personal gratification. And it also 
overlooks the simple economic fact that the indi- 
vidual members of the Family get far less value for 
their money when they spend it as wnits, when, that 
is, they are their own housekeepers, than they do as 
members of a well-organised household, when they 
share in the services of a skilful housekeeper. i A mit | Ale But more important than this economic considera- 
tion is the fact that in the normal Family, where even 
an ayerage amount of mutual consideration and affec- 
tioni has prevailed, the child’s main interests and 
easures are centred in or gather around the family 
group. They are not confined to it; the school life 
and school companions, later on work and work com- 
‘panions, afford interests which may become competing, 
but which normally are complementary. But the 
home is the centre, both in a material and moral 
sense, from which he starts each day afresh, and to 
which each day takes him back at night. Were 
there no deeper influence at work this merely physical 
fact would in itself constitute a habit of mind and 
body of great effect. But the mind of the child is 
   
-P-A-G-E-211
  cH. vit BASIS OF THE MODERN FAMILY 205 
even more deeply rooted in the Family as its centre ; 
his earliest words, ideas, modes of thought, are those 
he gathers from parents and brethren; and each day 
he takes back to them the new words and ideas which 
he gathers in the outside world, and they again are 
moulded and interpreted by the Family. He recounts 
his exploits, tells of his companions and teachers, is 
subjected to praise or criticism, and listens to similar 
narratives from other members; and next day he 
returns to the outside world to collect fresh material 
to be thrown into the Family mould. Even in Families 
where there is less than the normal show of affection, 
the habits formed in this way are so strong that they 
do not break without some special stress being put 
upon them. When the authority of the parents has 
been wisely and not harshly maintained, another 
powerful influence is present to hold the young folk 
under the shelter of their guidance and experience ; 
and when the crowning joy of family life is added in 
the mutual affection which comes of joys and sorrows 
shared in common, and of tender care repaid with 
loving gratitude, then nothing short of the love of 
man for woman, the love which demands a new 
Family, is strong enough to loosen the bonds of 
the old. 
And even this will often not prevail at once where 
the needs of the old Family are such as to constitute 
a serious claim. The boy (or girl) who contributes 
from his first earnings towards the family income 
does so with pride; he feels that his position has 
approximated to that of the head of the Family; the
-P-A-G-E-212
  206 THE FAMILY PART IL 
claim upon him is regarded as a privilege rather than 
aburden. And ifthe claim is not pressed tyrannically 
or selfishly, this attitude towards it persists long after 
the freshness of novelty is worn off; the first childish 
pleasure passes into a sense of duty which is no 
more oppressive than any other duty in life, and the 
strengthening sense of responsibility for the weaker 
members of the Family becomes gradually too firmly 
rooted to be broken down by any desire for any mere 
personal gratification. The very fact of the claim 
being made is far more powerful to hold the Family 
together than to disintegrate it. 
The sharing in a common responsibility must count, 
then, as a strong influence in holding the Family 
together ; and will help to explain what I believe to 
be a fact, that amongst the wage-earners the claims 
of the Family are frequently even more fully recog- 
nised than amongst the more prosperous middle-class, 
where the dangers of poverty are more remote, and 
where the young people are seldom called upon to 
contribute towards the maintenance of the household. 
Finally, we may ask, Is there, in the modern 
Family, anything to correspond to the family tradition 
which arises in connection with the possession of land, 
and which we have seen to be such a powerful factor 
in preserving the unity and continuity of an “old” 
Family ? 
What is needed to support such a tradition is some 
permanent interest, with which the family name may 
be connected, and in which successive generations|
-P-A-G-E-213
  ‘iH. vir BASIS OF THE MODERN FAMILY 207 
nay share; something, in short, which corresponds 
0 the “cult” of the old patriarchal Family. Such 
in interest does exist, and to a very large extent, in 
he work in which the Family is engaged When for 
yeneration after generation son succeeds to father in 
1is occupation, all the conditions for establishing an 
ld tradition are present ; the pride of good workman- 
ship, no less noble than the pride of great deeds, 
ecomes a family heirloom; the family name becomes 
cnown and respected within the limits of the trade ; 
ind the inheritance of skill and experience and know- 
edge upon which each generation enters afresh has 
she great advantage over material property that no 
system of Primogeniture is required to keep it intact, 
since it may be shared in freely by all the sons 
without suffering diminution. 
But does this continuity of work really exist to 
ny considerable extent in the modern Family? I 
ave no hesitation in affirming that it does, in varying 
egrees, but amongst almost all classes. In trade and 
ommerce and banking, the great “ houses,” with their 
long traditions, are too well known to need mention- 
g. In the professions there would seem to be less 
efinite continuity as between the various branches, 
hough it may be regarded almost as a matter of 
ourse that the sons of professional men will them- 
elves enter one or another of the professions. And 
lhe following extract from an article by Bishop 
elldon, on the ‘‘ Children of the Clergy,”’ seems to 
dicate a considerate amount of specialised con- 
1 Nineteenth Century, Feb. 1906.
-P-A-G-E-214
  208 THE FAMILY PART I 
tinuity. The article is primarily in exaltation o 
members of the clerical profession, but it serves t 
illustrate the point. He explains how he ha 
examined the parentage of every person entered it 
the Dictionary of National Biography, “and if 
confine myself to the centuries succeeding the Reforma 
tion, during which the Protestant clergy have bee: 
allowed to marry, it is safe to assert not only tha 
the clerical profession has sent out an immens 
number of children who, according to the languag 
of the Bidding prayer in the ancient universities, hav 
“served God both in church and state’ with succes 
and distinction, but that no other profession has sen 
out so many children equally successful and equall; 
distinguished. . . . It is a reasonable expectatioi 
that children will be found to attain their prepon 
derant distinction in the profession of their fathers 
and the Dictionary of National Biography bears i 
out. The continuous renown of such families as th 
Yorkes and Coleridges in the law, of the Wordsworth 
and the Summers in the Church, of the Darwins i 
science, of the Arnolds in literature, is familiar t 
students of modern English life. As literary me 
have been in large proportions the sons of literar 
men, politicians of politicians, lawyers of lawyers, an 
actors of actors, so have clergymen habitually bee 
born and bred in clerical homes. I find then as man 
as 850 names of more or less well-known men wh 
have not only been sons of clergymen, but have then 
selves been clergymen.” 
It seems possible that some of the superior efficienc 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
cH. vit BASIS OF THE MODERN FAMILY 209 
as parents which is here claimed for the clergy may 
have been due at one time to the system of church 
patronage already referred to; but that would only 
be one of the causes tending to an hereditary occupa- 
tion. The point is, that it does exist to a large 
extent. 
But it is perhaps when we come to the industrial 
classes, the people to whom their calling is their one 
great possession, that the tendency to continuity is 
most marked. It is especially striking when the 
supply of labour is highly organised, and something 
like the conditions of a monopoly have been estab- 
lished. Here we find all the characteristics of an 
aristocracy repeating themselves: the same exclusive- 
ness and family pride, and the same uninterrupted 
succession of generation to generation. It is in the 
jold days of the “crafts” that we find this continuity 
lof labour best illustrated, just as it is in the old days 
that we find the most extreme form of the feudal 
amily based upon property; and the following ex- 
ract from The Baxter Books of St. Andrews gives 
wo good instances :— 
“. .. There were several remarkable families— 
emarkable for the long period in which their members 
ere associated with the craft. It is not surprising 
hat the connection in several instances should have 
een a very long one, when it is remembered that to 
ucceed to the right of entry into a craft was almost 
quivalent to a down-setting for life. Very frequently 
he eldest son was devoted to his father’s trade, whilst 
he younger ones had to branch off into other pur- 
P    
       
   
   
       
  
-P-A-G-E-216

suits. The craft was a wider family. Many of the 
members were united by blood, many by marriage. 
The means of communication between the inhabitants 
of a city and other districts were few in number and 
rudimentary in character. There was a strong ten- 
dency for men to remain in the place of their nativity, 
to marry with neighbours’ daughters, and to! trade and 
associate with those whom they had known from 
boyhood. For generation after generation the rights 
of membership were handed down withy ‘as much care, 
and doubtless as much pride, as was, 4he inheritance 
in landed property in higher circles. I have casually 
instanced the Honeymans. They, the Duncansons, 
and the Arthurs were the most prominent families. 
The two former ran each other very close in the 
duration of their trade dynasties, and as far as our 
records can assist us, the advantage lies with the 
Honeymans to the comparatively trifling extent of 
twenty years in a period of nearly 210.

in that quaint old building found abundant confirma

extent kept up by a Union amongst the men, an¢ 
both the Union and the Court of the Company favou 
the apprenticeship of the sons and relations o 
members, though there is no rule against outsiders 
and these are not infrequently admitted. But (i 
was explained to me) this is mostly in connectio1 
with the Family : a young member gets fond of a girl 
and introduces her brother, and so on. Cases are si 
numerous of the trade running in families that th 
difficulty was rather to find exceptions than instances 
Name after name was mentioned of men whos 
ancestors for generations had been watermen befor 
them. Unfortunately the oldest registers had bee: 
destroyed by fire, but finally one was produced datin;

over a few pages of it, noting the names of men whos 
descendants still remained on the books, and the 
were very numerous. Of those who have droppe

for far back, because of the absence of genealogic:

“ Hand-Frame Knitters.—Yes, it is customary in 
our trade for the sons to follow the same employment 
as their fathers; the custom prevails to a very great 
extent. The oldest family that I can trace back in 
Calverton is the family of B. Thomas B. was born 
at Papplewick in the county of Notts in the year 1724, 
and followed the trade of hand-frame knitting ; his son

“ Bricklayers.—It certainly largely prevails. I

“ Patternmakers—Ours is a comparatively modern 
industry. About fifty per cent follow their fathers’ 
trade, but seldom more than one son from one

“ Tinplate Workers.—1. The custom for sons to

prevails, and there are instances of families having 
followed the trade for several generations. 2. I 
would say that a very large proportion take to the 
same work as their fathers in the iron and steel 
trades, and there are many instances of sons follow- 
ing fathers for several generations in the same 
employment.” 
In the large localised industries this continuity of 
work is almost universal. Amongst the miners in all 
parts of the country generation follows generation 
with rare exceptions. In Northumberland some of 
the sons “are put to teaching or go to some trade. 
But you may take it that the large number go to 
the pits, as their fathers did before them. I am 
acquainted with many families that can trace back 
for four generations that their forefathers have 
worked in the pits.’ In Cumberland, Durham, 
Derbyshire, Nottingham, and South Wales we find 
the custom universal. It is the same in the textile 
trades; and these two great industries alone include 
a large proportion of the workers of the country.
-P-A-G-E-222
  216 THE FAMILY PART I 
From a small minority of Unions I hear that it is 
not customary for sons to follow their father’s work. In 
some cases definite reasons are assigned for it. One 
Association writes: “A very large number of the 
members themselves have so many disadvantages to 
contend with, that they make every effort to put 
their sons to some other trade”; and others as well 
cite the bad condition of the particular trade as a 
reason why sons are no longer following their fathers. 
But where the father has a skilled trade in which 
there are fair prospects for the future, it is the rule 
rather than the exception that he will pass it on to 
his son. 
In the absence of a trade union it becomes in- 
creasingly difficult to show this continuity ; but here 
and there one gets glimpses of facts which bear 
witness to it. ‘There are a great many shepherds in 
Northumberland, both on the low ground and among 
the Cheviot Hills, the whole of which are let in sheep 
farms. ‘The great majority of these men in the 
Border districts are the sons, grandsons, or great- 
grandsons of shepherds. They are said to ‘run in 
families,’ and there are instances where a family has 
followed the calling of shepherd for many generations. 
Few men who have not been so bred and trained are 
to be found working as shepherds in these districts.” * 
The following case, which came under my notice 
recently, illustrates the continuity in one of the more 
humble branches of the ecclesiastical profession. An 
old widow, Mrs. A., was applying for a pension, and 
1 Board of Trade Report on Wages of Agricultural Labourers, p. 15. 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  cu. vir BASIS OF THE MODERN FAMILY 217 
based her claims upon her family record. She and 
her late husband had been for twenty-five years 
sexton and sextoness at a city church, where before 
marriage her husband had been pew-opener and bell- 
ringer. His’ father had been organ-blower in the 
same Parish church for fifty-six years, his uncle was 
Parish schoolmaster, and his grandfather had been 
Parish beadle, keeper of the fire-engine, and street 
keeper of the Parish in the days before policemen 
were thought of. A similar continuity existed in the 
family’s secular employment; for Mr. A. had worked 
with the same firm as his father before him, and as 
also Mrs. A.’s father and brother. How strongly the 
family bond was felt is shown by the fact that Mrs. 
A., having no children of her own, adopted and 
brought up an orphan nephew of her husband's, with 
whom she now lives. This nephew is a book-keeper 
by trade, but has started a stationery shop in addi- 
ion, to provide employment for his young daughters. 
is wife is much attached to old Mrs. A., and 
ays they will always care for her, pension or no 
ension. 
I think, then, it is no exaggeration to say, that 
herever we find an industry of any degree of 
pecialisation, as distinct from unskilled and un- 
pecialised labour, there we may find to a greater or 
ess extent a continuity of work binding the genera- 
ions together, and affording a basis for continuous 
amily life as real and firm, if not as tangible, as 
anded property itself.
-P-A-G-E-224
  218 THE FAMILY PART I 
Finally, underlying all others, there is one funda- 
mental bond which I have not yet dwelt upon—it is 
the primitive instinctive attachment which, with rare 
exceptions, binds parent to child throughout the 
whole range of the animal world. It is sometimes 
called the maternal instinct, as if it were confined to 
the mother; but though the father may occasionally 
be more reticent in his demonstrations, it is very 
doubtful whether his feeling is not just as real and 
compelling in the first instance. Though the physical 
tie is not so close as that between the mother and 
her infant, yet the protective instinct of the strong 
towards the weak is perhaps even more strongly 
developed in the man than in the woman. 
This elementary instinct forms one element, but 
only one, in the basis upon which the Family is built 
up. Unless it is supplemented and strengthened by 
other influences it is apt to wear away and suffer 
degradation as the children pass beyond the days of 
infancy and lose the first touching appeal of helpless- 
ness. It is notably so amongst the “ unstable” 
Families, where the organising influences of the forces 
we have been considering never come into play. Yet 
even here the protective instinct will linger long after 
every other sign of affection seems to have vanished. 
Parents who will neglect and even ill-treat theiz 
children themselves, will furiously resent any approach 
to interference or ill-treatment from outsiders. 
But the higher influences which form the main 
persisting strength of the typical modern Family 
tend to be entirely absent in the unstable Family ;
-P-A-G-E-225
cu. vir BASIS OF THE MODERN FAMILY 219 
it is, indeed, their absence which causes, and to a 
certain extent constitutes the instability, and differ- 
entiates it from the stable Family. If we take first 
industrial co-operation, we may look for it in vain 
amongst these Families except in the degraded form 
already referred to, in which the children are engaged 
in the sweated “home industries”; even the wife’s 
function is hardly differentiated from that of the 
husband, and it is just as likely as not that she will 
be the principal wage-earner. Economic co-operation 
in its true sense also fails; the children’s earnings 
may be impounded so long as they are young enough 
to submit, but the sense of mutual responsibility is 
undeveloped, and no claim is felt beyond the claim of 
superior force. Nothing is more noticeable to those 
who have been in touch with these unstable Families 
that even where the fathers themselves have been 
skilled artisans, they have neglected to ensure that 
their children were taught a trade, and have allowed 
them to drift into the ranks of “ unskilled labour ””— 
the ranks, that is, of those with no training aptitudes 
or skill to hand on to their children when the time 
comes.. They are like the rich man who has dissi- 
pated the estate of the Family, and casts its members 
without resources adrift upon the world. 
How these unstable Families have come to lose 
these organising influences is another question. M. 
Demolins would seem to hold (see p. 194) that they 
are the product of the disintegration of patriarchal 
Families, and that they are by race unfitted to 
chieve the strength of family life without the     
             
   
    
   
-P-A-G-E-226
  220 THE FAMILY PART IL 
support of the larger family community, and the 
family property behind them. But it would be hard 
to show that the wreckage of family life which exists 
in most of our large towns is for the most part racially 
different from the strongly organised community in 
and upon which they live, though where the Irish 
element is strong, as in Glasgow and Liverpool and 
certain quarters of London, it certainly contributes 
an unduly large share. 
But if we go behind the question of race we find 
the same causes at work, both in the disjecta membra 
of the family communities which M. Demolins has 
in mind, and in the wreckage of our towns. In both 
cases the individual has been taught to rely upon 
other than his own strength—in the one upon the 
family community,” in the other upon Poor Laws, 
charities, and other adventitious aids; in both cases 
the children lack the training which is necessary to 
their salvation: “They are not trained to obedience, 
to respect of parental authority, to the spirit of 
economy . . . nor are they trained to individual 
initiative, to zeal for work, to progressive methods.” 
It is family life alone, with its claims and responsi- 
bilities, its continuity of interests and sympathies, 
which can reorganise these drifting atoms of humanity, 
and bring them back into the main current of social] 
life; and, fortunately for humanity, the Family is an 
institution with an inveterate power of reasserting} 
itself in the absence of unwise interference.

| CHAPTER IX 
THE ECONOMIC FUNCTION OF THE FAMILY 
     
                              
   WE have seen to what a considerable extent economic 
forces contribute towards strengthening the bonds of 
family life; we have now to consider some of the 
ways in which the Family is itself an economic force, 
and as such reacts upon the wealth and welfare of the 
community. 
In the first place, we may say that amongst those 
sections of society where a living is only to be ob- 
tained by working for it—that is, amongst almost the 
whole of society—it is the institution of the Family 
which is the principal motive to work. ‘“ We have 
never yet estimated from the point of view of political 
economy,” writes Dr. Emanuel Hermann,’ “the motive 
power which love and the desire for marriage represent 
in the choice of a calling and the preparation for it, 
in the competition for places, in business undertakings. 
In itself, love is far from being an economic passion ; 
t dashes forward unfettered as the waters of a moun- 
tain torrent. But when restrained and guided, love, 
like the torrent, may yield enormous economic results.

222 THE FAMILY PART II 
How much of the toil in workshops and factories is 
undergone for the sake of making a home, and how 
much for the sake of the Family which follows. 
Enterprising journeys, daring speculations, as well as 
ceaseless industry, self-denial in consumption, economy, 
and the fruitful application of all the powers of mind 
and body, are due to this impulse, ennobled and puri- 
fied in the Family, and so guided and stimulated to 
economic ends.” 
There are, of course, men and women who will 
satisfy their desires without undertaking the respon- 
sibilities of family life, and so avoid the need for 
strenuous work. There are others who find their 
chief delight in work for its own sake; and others, 
again, to whom the mere amassing of wealth is a 
sufficient stimulus to continued exertion. But all 
these are exceptions, and do not represent the normal 
average man. Nothing but the combined rights and 
responsibilities of family life will ever rouse the 
average man to his full degree of efficiency, and 
induce him to continue working after he has earned 
sufficient to meet his own personal needs. Moreover, 
it is, speaking generally, the only agency which will 
induce him to direct any considerable amount of his 
income from the gratification of his own personal 
needs to meet the needs of those who are unable to 
provide for their own. # The Family, in short, is, from 
this point of view, the only known way of ensuring, 
with any approach to success, that one generation 
will exert itself in the interests and for the sake of 
another ; and its effect upon the economic efficiency  
-P-A-G-E-229
  HAP. IX ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION 223 
f both generations is in this respect alone of para- 
nount importance. It may be roughly measured by 
he difference between the efficiency of the average 
tisan and that of the solitary frequenter of casual 
vards and common lodging-houses; or in a higher 
ocial circle between the economic exertions and 
acrifices of the ordinary respectable father of a Family 
ind the unmarried society man without a profession. 
‘Ces péres de famille sont capables de tout”; and 
mongst the everything must be included an immense 
mount of hard work and devotion. 
Nor_is it only the-fathers who.are stimulated to. 
trenuous work by family responsibilities. We have 
ready noted to what a large extent economic co- | 
yperation exists between all the adult members of ™ 
age-earning Families. To complete the economic 
ignificance of this co-operation it must also be noted 
hat in most cases it enables the Family not only to 
rovide for the young, but also to make very effective 
rovision against times of sickness or out of work, 
nd very considerable savings. Hence the temporary 
isability of any one member of a Family becomes a 
atter of comparatively small importance, and there 
a fund to draw upon, if needed, to start any of the 
ounger ones in life. In short, the Family acts, from 
his point of view, as a mutual benefit society with 
xtended functions. 
To a very large extent also this co-operation 
mongst the efficient members of a Family provides 
r those who are past work. We know too little of 
ur people to enable us to say with certainty how far   
-P-A-G-E-230
  224 THE FAMILY PART 
this still remains true in face of the competition o! 
Poor Law and the expectation of State pensions; 
but it is beyond doubt that the majority of the aged 
have their independence assured by membership o! 
a family group. The same is true of innumerable 
cripples and invalids, and used to be so of many 
of the mentally afflicted who are now secluded in 
asylums. 
It seems clear, then, that this grouping together 
of individuals into economic units comprising both 
strong and weak elements would be in itself, if it 
were nothing more, a most successful device for maxim. 
ising the economic efficiency of a people. There are 
other conceivable methods of providing for the weaker 
members of a community, but none which call out 
the best qualities of the average man and woman tc 
the same extent. It sometimes seems to us as if if 
would be cheaper and more effective to sort out al 
the old people on the one hand, and the children or 
the other, and have them managed by experts anc 
paid for out of the taxes; and much of our moderr 
philanthropy is engaged in perfecting methods in thi 
direction. But what man would submit to be taxec 
to even half of what he is willing to spend on hi 
family if it is left in his personal care? He migh 
indeed have the fear of the tax-collector before hi 
eyes, but as a motive that could never be an adequat 
substitute for the passions and affections which ar 
the true incentive to enter upon and maintain famil; 
life. A passive resistance which took the form o 
economic inefficiency would be impossible to cop
-P-A-G-E-231
HAP. IX ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION 225 
with, and a bankrupt State would ultimately have 
to return to its members their responsibilities in 
their more concrete and interesting form. 
But not only does the Family influence the amount 
of work which men will do, it is also largely in- 
luential in determining the kind of work which they 
will do. he general economic proposition that 
wages and net advantages will determine the supply 
of labour in any particular trade is, of course, true ; 
but when we come to examine how these determining 
conditions are brought to bear in any particular 
instance we shall find that it is nearly always through 
he medium of the Family.The lad who is making 
is choice of a profession knows little as yet of com- 
arative wages, and still less of net advantages; now 
      
    
   
    
        
     nd again he may have a strong inclination in some 
articular direction, but, generally speaking, his choice 
ill be determined by his parents. Their influence 
ill work, no doubt, in various ways. A boy may 
e attracted to a trade or profession in which he sees 
is father contented and efficient, or repelled from 
me in which he sees him discontented and failing. 
ut when any calculation of advantages and dis- 
vantages is to be made, it will be made by the 
arents. When his trade is unsatisfactory or shows 
ens of failing the father will warn his boys off (see 
. 216); but in the majority of cases he will hand on 
is trade to one or more of his sons. 
Local opportunity, of course, is another factor in 
termining the choice of work; but here again it is 
Q
-P-A-G-E-232
226 THE FAMILY PART I 
generally the Family which is ultimately determining 
It is the desire to retain the boy within the shelter o! 
home life, when his parents cannot afford to pay for 
a substitute for that home life, which restricts hi: 
choice of occupation to a particular locality. On the 
other hand, his choice of occupations is restricted fa1 
more seriously where the home life fails. One of the 
chief difficulties which Poor Law Guardians have ti 
contend with in selecting an occupation for the 
children passing out of their care is that they have 
no Family to live with during the early years of work 
hence there is a tendency for a large proportion o 
the boys to be sent to the army or to sea, whil 
nearly all the girls are sent to domestic service. (Ii 
is a curious meeting of extremes which makes army 
and navy the favoured professions in the highest 
rank on the one hand, and the lowest on _ th 
other.) 
Within wider limits, again, the social position o| 
the Family will determine the callings of the childre: 
almost absolutely; we can predict with much co 
fidence of a Family in any particular walk in li 
whether its sons will be merely “ gentlemen,” or wi 
enter a profession, or will work with head or wit 
hands, for a wage or for a salary. And even in the: 
days of changing views about women’s education, it 
still easy to foresee whether the daughters will 
trained to useful work, or left to make a business o 
of pleasure, or even whether they will get the di 
cipline and example which will make them efficie: 
housewives and mothers. The influence of the Fami

; less absolute than it was; it is more possible for 
ons to raise themselves from a lower status to a 
igher one; for daughters to rebel against tradition 
nd become economically efficient; but even these 
xceptions will depend largely upon whether the 
nfluence of the Family has been stimulating or 
nervating. 
How great this general influence of the Family is 
n determining the occupations of the young may be 
lustrated by a difference which has often been noted 
etween French and English families—a difference 
yhich is far-reaching in its economic and social 
ffects. It would seem that in French families the 
ependence, both moral and economic, of the children 
prolonged far beyond what it is in England; and 
cording to French writers this prolonged dependence 
largely responsible for a marked lack of initiative 
d enterprise on the part of the young people, 
ading them away from commerce and industry 
wards the ranks of small officialdom. “Ask a 
ndred young Frenchmen, just out of school, to 
hat career they are inclined, three-quarters of them 
ill answer you that they are candidates for Govern- 
ent offices. . . . Independent callings, as a rule, 
ly find their recruits amongst young men who have 
en unsuccessful in entering those careers.”! The 
jason for this preference is described by the same 
thor in the following vivid terms: “How do we 
epare our children? What do we teach them? 
1 Demolins, The Superiority of the Anglo-Saxon, p. 3.
-P-A-G-E-234
228 THE FAMILY PART 1 
We teach them that the ideal, the supreme wisdor 
in life, is to avoid as much as possible all its diff 
culties and uncertainties. We tell them, ‘My dea 
child, first of all rely upon us. You see how w 
save money in order to be able at the time of you 
marriage to give you as large a portion as possible 
We are too fond of you not to do our utmost to eas 
for you the difficulties of existence. Next, rely o 
our relations and friends, who will exert their ix 
fluence to find you a cosy berth. You must rely o 
the Government, too, which disposes of an innume! 
able quantity of comfortable posts, perfectly safi 
and salary paid regularly at the end of each month 
advancement automatic through the mechanism « 
retirement and deaths, so that you shall be able t 
know in advance what your emoluments are at suc 
and such an age. At such another age, too, yo 
will retire and be entitled to a pension—a good litt! 
pension. So, after doing very little work durin 
your administrative career, you will be able to 
nothing at all at a time of life when a man is sti 
capable of activity. But, my dear child, as the 
situations imply but indifferent pay (for we cann 
get everything), you must reckon on what your wi 
may bring you. A moneyed wife must, therefore, 
found; but do not be uneasy about this, we'll fi 
you one. Such is, my boy, the advice which o 
love dictates.’ The young man who hears such la 
guage daily at home, in society, in the very stre 
not unnaturally gets accustomed to the idea of relyii 
on others more than on self; he is consequently d
-P-A-G-E-235
HAP, IX ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION 229 
osed to shun all careers requiring continuous exer- 
ion and mental activity; he would never dream of 
raving the uncertainties of agriculture, industry, 
r commerce, and simply prepares for a tranquil 
xistence.” 
A more striking contrast could hardly be pre- 
ented than this picture affords with the family 
tmosphere in which the normal British boy is 
rought up. He knows that he will get the educa- 
ion which is considered sufficient and customary in 
is father’s social stratum, and perhaps enough capital 
0 apprentice him to a trade, or to maintain him 
vhile learning a profession ; beyond that he expects 
o rely upon himself, and himself alone. If his 
arents make special efforts and sacrifices on his 
ehalf, it is only to enable him to make his start at 
somewhat higher level than they did themselves. 
e sees his friends and brothers launched off into 
dependence, and is only too eager for the time to 
me when he also will be permitted to try his 
renoth in the arena of real life. As for marriage 
ortions, any father not belonging to the plutocracy 
ould laugh at the idea of portioning his son, though 
le might give him a trifle towards furnishing ; and 
en the daughters amongst the great mass of the 
leople do not look for a dowry. For good or for 
il, I think again that the general feeling is on the 
hole against the man who makes too prudent a 
arriage, and that most Englishmen have a distaste

with the parts reversed. It is said that this differ 
ence of feeling about the wife’s money greatly affect: 
the position of women in the home and in society 
in the two countries; but that is another question 
The point now before us is, that marked nationa 
characteristics, such as influence the policy an 
destinies of the French and English peoples, hav 
their origin in different views of family life and it 
responsibilities. 
The question of the marriage portion brings us t 
another way in which the Family affects the whol 
economic organisation of a community, and that i 
by determining the transmission of property from on 
generation to another. This may take place on th 
occasion of the founding of new Families, and in som 
countries does so to a large extent. Amongst wealth 
Families in all countries the marriage of the childre 
is the occasion of the transference of property. I 
countries such as France, where the custom of th 
marriage portion is found amongst all classes, thi 
transference within the Family is continually takin, 
place. In 1883 it averaged (in France) 2000 fran 
for every marriage.” But in England for the mai 
part it takes place, not when the new Families a 
founded, but when the old ones break up; that i 
upon the death of the parents. Even where there 
by law freedom of bequest, custom and public opini 
combine with the natural influence of family affecti 
to cause that the greater proportion of property pass 
along the lines of family relationship. In fact, t: 
1 Hermann, p. 25. 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
CHAP, IX ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION 231 
property is so far still regarded as belonging rather 
to the Family than to the individual, that it is con- 
sidered unnatural to leave any considerable part of 
it away from the immediate relations. And where 
the law does attempt to control the transmission, it 
is always to support the claims of members of the 
Family,—either of the one against the many, as in the 
German Anerbenrecht; or of the many against the 
one, as in the French law of division; or of the 
Family as against the outside world, as in the English 
law of intestacy. Even the succession duties, by 
which a portion of the property to be transmitted is 
appropriated by the State for its own use, favours its 
transmission to members of the Family by making 
he tax lighter in proportion as it is left to nearer 
elations. 
It is difficult to estimate what would be the 
conomic effect if this habit of transmitting the 
roperty through the Family should be abandoned. 
‘0 judge from what happens now in the absence or 
epudiation of a natural heir, charitable and religious 
nstitutions would attract an increasingly large share 
f the wealth of the country; while the strange 
esire of man to keep his name and his property 
ogether after he himself ceases to be the link, would 
ead to the continual founding of new endowments. 
his would mean that every year would see more of 
he wealth of the country withdrawn from active 
nterprise and tied down to uses which every year 
ould make more unsuited to its needs. On the 
ther hand, it is likely that when no strong custom 
        
   
   
         
    
       
  
-P-A-G-E-238
  232 THE FAMILY PART II 
would be violated, and no justified expectations 
injured, the State would claim an increasingly large 
share in the form of succession duty, and utilise it either 
to the relief of the living taxpayer or to the exten- 
sion of communistic enterprise. Whichever of these 
results we may consider most probable, or whatever 
combination of them, it would seem clear that the 
Family, by maintaining the transmission of property 
into the hands of individuals, is a powerful influence 
in support of one form of economic organisation 
against others. 
Finally, we come to the most important of the 
economic functions of the Family, perhaps the most 
important purely economic function which exists at 
all, since it controls directly and finally the prosperity 
and the ruin of nations. In the Family, and in the 
Family alone, are combined the forces which deter- 
mine the quantity of population with the’ forces 
which determine its quality ; and without this com 
bination the decay of a people is inevitable. N 
State is strong enough, no State ever has been o 
ever will be strong enough to guard by its ow: 
action against this possible deterioration of its people. 
It cannot even enforce a limitation of the number 
of its people, and, indeed, the problem is not one o 
limitation of quantity at all, but the much mor 
delicate one of quality. Where the quality is righ 
no necessary limit is at present within view; wher 
the quality is wrong, each one is one too many 
“What do we mean when we speak of a surplu 
population? It can only be in an economic sens
-P-A-G-E-239
  CHAP. IX ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION 233 
that we venture to speak of any person or set of 
persons as surplus—from any other point of view it 
would be arrogance beyond measure; and from an 
economic point of view it must mean one of two 
things. In the first place, it might mean that the 
people in question were in excess of the actual amount 
of food, housing, etc., available for their support. 
But if this were all, there would be no reason for 
fixing upon any particular individuals or class as 
surplus more than any other; if there is one man too 
many in a boat, all are potentially that one, and the 
sacrifice of any one will get rid of the surplus. But 
the case is altered if there is one man only amongst 
them who cannot row, who is, therefore, a dead weight 
in the boat. His incapacity at once marks him out 
as the individual who is surplus, because he has no 
function to fulfil. So it is in society. When we 
speak of a surplus population we do not mean (merely) 
that numbers are so great as to exceed the means of 
subsistence ; but we do mean that there is a particular 
section which is incapable of performing any useful 
function, and that therefore it is, from an economic 
point of view, surplus. There may, or may not, be 
other points of view from which its presence is desir- 
able, and from which therefore it is not ‘surplus.’ 
The quantity of population then is excessive only 
when its quality is defective, and the problem thus 
becomes, not how to limit the population in number, 
but how to regulate it in respect of its quality. This 
can only be achieved when the will which determines 
the quantity of population is one with that which 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
234 THE FAMILY PART II 
determines its quality. That is to say, in the 
Family.” 
Of the function of the Family as an educative 
influence, fitting its members to become citizens of a 
larger community, we shall consider more fully in 
subsequent chapters. But its importance is no less 
as a means of selecting and perpetuating those types 
of human beings who are most fitted to live in 
communities, who have “co-operative” qualities. 
“Broadly speaking, the co-operative individual, as 
demanded by civilised life, can only be produced in 
the family, and therefore by a stock capable of pro- 
ducing a true family ; and the test and engine of his 
production is the peculiar form of moral responsibility, 
supported by law and covering both material and 
moral incidents, which the family implies. Its unique 
importance as an agent of selection arises, of course, 
from the fact that to the family is entrusted the 
multiplication of the species, and its automatic action 
as a selective agency depends on the recognition of 
the principle that this union should only be entered 
on where the conditions of success in the struggle for 
a distinctively human existence, including as through- 
out a proper rearing of offspring, may be reasonably 
anticipated. The question of population is not a 
mere numerical question ; of some qualities of popu- 
lation it is impossible to have too much, for they 
are self-limiting, of others every individual is in 
excess. The main difference between these kinds of 
population depends on the material and moral re- 
sponsibility for the family being left with those who  
-P-A-G-E-241
CHAP, IX ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION 235 
have voluntarily formed it, and on every discourage- 
ment being thrown in the way of unions taking place 
where the true conditions of family life do not exist. 
I say, then, that the struggle to realise the conditions 
of true family life in its moral and material senses is 
the human ‘struggle for existence’ within the group, 
and that defeat in this struggle does largely entail, 
and ought so far as possible to entail, the extinction 
of the stock so failing.” * 
The belief that the prosperity of any community, 
whether Family or nation, can only be secured by 
limiting its numbers, is one which constantly recurs 
both in theory and practice; and it arises from re- 
garding the available means of support as a fixed 
amount to be divided amongst all comers, so that the 
more applicants there are the less there will be for 
each. It ignores the possibility that each new-comer 
may contribute more than he consumes, in which 
case the more there are the greater will be the share 
for each. The difference of the two views and their 
actual effect upon family, social, and national life, 
can hardly be more strikingly illustrated than if we 
again compare the habits of typical French and 
English families. 
No people, as we have already seen, are more 
solicitous about the welfare of their children than the 
French; and parents will practise any sacrifice to 
ensure that their children shall not fall below the 
social standard which is their ideal. But they regard 
this ideal as primarily dependent upon a given 
1B, Bosanquet, Aspects of the Social Problem, pp. 299, 300. .
-P-A-G-E-242
  236 THE FAMILY PART II 
amount of material wealth—land or money—and 
treat the matter as a division sum. Hence the 
number of their children tends to be determined by 
the number of “ portions” which they are able to 
provide ; with the result that the native-born popu- 
lation of France is actually declining. 
In support of this statement, which of course is 
not of universal application, I will quote again the 
picturesque language of M. Demolins: “ Amongst us 
a numerous family is such an overwhelming burden 
that, do what they may, there is but one resource 
for the parents, and that is to elude the difficulty. 
They cannot rely for the settling of their children 
either on the family community, which is dissolved, 
or on the children’s own initiative, which is smothered 
by their mode of education. The establishment of 
the children, therefore, remains in charge of the parents. | 
A French father cannot get his children married 
except by giving each a portion ; he is thus compelled 
to make as many fortunes as he has children, and | 
this before the marriage of each, that is to say, within 
a period of eighteen to thirty years! You have just 
married. One year later you have a child. Is your | 
vision that of a fair little head, a sweet smile? No: } 
the vision is the surging ghost of a dowry, a portion | 
which you will have to find. Eighteen months or 
two years later another child—that is another portion | 
to constitute. Two portions in twenty-five years! 
You feel unequal to doing more, and in presence of 
a material impossibility you make up your mind to: 
stop the expense. . . . Statistics fully establish the
-P-A-G-E-243
  CHAP. IX ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION 237 
influence of the dowry system in promoting voluntary 
sterility ; the wealthier, the more provident classes 
(those who have to raise the money wherewith to 
portion their children), are those that have the smaller 
families. The poorer and less provident (the working 
classes) have large families; they are the classes 
whose children are left to grow and start in life as 
best they can. Thus, in the industrial département 
of the Nord, where the working population is 
numerous, there is a considerable excess in the 
number of births. as compared to deaths—51,197 
against 35,089 deaths. On the contrary, in rich 
agricultural districts, the death-rate is higher. In 
the Eure, 6842 births and 8128 deaths; in the Oise, 
8851 births and 9068 deaths; in the Orne, 6851 
births and 8534 deaths, ete.”’? 
The other point of view is illustrated, more or less 
unconsciously on their part, by the typical English 
Family. English parents, no less than French, desire 
that their children should not fall below the standard 
attained by themselves; perhaps even more than the 
French they are ambitious for them to rise above it. 
But they aim less at endowing them with material 
property than with the qualities which tend to the 
creation of property. The man who has given his 
sons a “ good start””—that is, has sent them out well 
equipped mentally and physically to fight their own 
way—would be generally considered to have done 
well by them, better indeed than if he had merely 
saved a sum of money to be divided amongst them. 
1 Demolins, The Superiority of the Anglo-Saxon, p. 119.
-P-A-G-E-244
  238 THE FAMILY PART II 
And when the ideal of the Family (or of the State) 
is that each member shall be creative of his own 
fortune, then the necessity for limiting its numbers 
is diminished indefinitely, since each child that can 
be properly brought up is a source of added strength, 
not weakness. 
One curious tendency of Family life in affecting 
both the quantity and quality of the people has been 
noted by German writers. I hardly know how far 
it could be substantiated, but there is sufficient prob- 
ability about it to make it worth mentioning. I 
refer to the effect which the action of one generation 
has upon the next in influencing it to a contrary 
course of action. To take a simple instance, we are 
all familiar with the paradox that unselfish parents 
may make selfish children, and wice versa. Dr. 
Hermann considers that the rate of population is 
directly affected in this way : ‘“‘ When the number of 
children increases too fast, then the first-born must 
leave the home early ; they see their portion diminished, 
and feel themselves deserted. . . . When later they 
themselves marry they are careful to limit the number 
of their children, so that we frequently find genera- 
tions with few children following generations with 
many, and vice versa.” * 
Riehl notes a similar alternation in methods of 
education. Parents who have been sternly brought 
up desire a happier childhood for their own children ; 
while those who have been treated indulgently realise 
the ill-effects in themselves and are anxious to avoid 
1 Hermann, Die Familie, p. 19.
-P-A-G-E-245
CHAP. IX ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION 239 
a repetition of them. Hence the generations alternate 
between being “ geschmeichelte” and “ gepriigelte.” 
I have said that our English Family is based upon 
the view that every child which can be properly 
brought up is a source of added strength, both to the 
Family itself and to the community. But what if 
the children cannot be properly brought up? If the 
mere task of bringing them properly equipped to the 
point from which they must start on their own 
account is beyond the powers of the parents, then 
has not the Family failed in this most important of 
        
    
     
     
   
     
    all its functions, and must it not be superseded ? 
That the Family sometimes fails is almost a matter 
lof course. Every institution must fail of its purpose 
when the individuals to whom it is entrusted to 
airy it on prove inadequate to the task which they 
ave undertaken ; but it does not follow that the in- 
titution itself is at fault. With the Family especially 
4 seems true that where it fails it is not through any 
nheritant defect, but that its efficiency has become 
mpaired through very definite causes affecting its 
esponsible members. Sometimes these causes are 
elatively inevitable; as when one or both of the 
arents has died or become physically incapable. 
ven then the Family does not always break down ; 
here are innumerable cases in which an elder brother 
r sister, an uncle or aunt, takes up the burden of the 
‘amily and bears it to a successful issue. Where this 
oes not happen, a substitute has to be provided by 
lhe community; and in England this substitute
-P-A-G-E-246
240 THE FAMILY PART II 
generally takes the form of schools or homes, where 
the children are maintained until they can be made 
independent. 
But in many cases the efficiency of the Family 
has become impaired from causes which are much 
more subtle and complex than physical disability or 
death. And they are also far more threatening to 
the continuance of the Family as an institution. 
Death is normally no destroyer of the Family, which 
may shed as many members as a tree sheds leaves, 
and be none the weaker for the process. But there 
are hostile forces which attack the spirit which is the 
bond of family life, and when that decays the Family 
is really destroyed. 
Many causes have been cited from time to time as 
tending to the disintegration of the Family. Perhaps 
the most formidable in appearance is the industrial 
change through which the Patriarchal Family has 
ceased to be an economic unit in a great part of the 
civilised world. With this change we have now] 
dealt, and we have seen reason to think that great as 
it has been, it has not been destructive of the Family 
that economic forces remain which are sufficient t 
make the Family both strong in itself and valuable t 
the community of which it is a part. But in order t 
estimate the real strength of the modern Family w 
must now examine it still more carefully in its natur 
and in its constituent parts.

CHAPTER X 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF FAMILY LIFE 
[In speaking of the psychology of family life, I have 
mn mind the development and play of those mental 
nd moral qualities which members of a Family owe 
ore especially to the fact that they are members 
f the Family, and which again lose a great part of 
heir significance unless they are interpreted in their 
elation to family life. These qualities fall natu- 
ally into two groups. Perhaps the most striking are 
hose characteristics which we speak of as family 
atts. Just as there are physical features, tendencies, 
abits, which reappear in generation after generation, 
rin one member after another of the same genera- 
ion, and can only be explained by reference to the 
amily, so also there are qualities of the mind, the 
aracter, the disposition, which belong peculiarly to 
e Family, and can only be understood in reference 
it. These form one of the principal groups of 
aracteristics in question. 
But before passing to consider these in detail, there 
a second set of facts to be taken into consideration, 
hich arise out of the constitution of a Family as 
ch; out of the fact, that is, that it is a community 
241 R
-P-A-G-E-248
242 THE FAMILY PART I 
made up of units dissimilar in age and sex, comple. 
mentary in their nature and mutually responsible 
As with all organic wholes, its parts are admirably 
fitted by nature to subserve each other’s needs, anc 
to supplement each other’s efforts. The need of the 
weak for protection finds its correlative in the pride 
of the strong in protecting; the clinging appeal o: 
the child for affection elicits a response which might 
otherwise remain dormant for ever. The authority 
which all adults like to exercise finds a beneficent 
outlet in guiding the action of immature wills ; anc 
children who weary when left to the caprices of thei 
undisciplined natures, find strength and contentmen 
in a rule which is autocratic without having th 
impersonal rigidity of external law. And the ma 
again, who would prefer solitude to the constan 
clashing at close quarters of his own will with tha 
of another man, finds it completed instead of thwarte 
when its functions are supplemented by those of t: 
woman. 
It may be objected that in any community whe 
strong and weak, old and young, male and femal 
are to be found there will be sufficient scope for t 
exercise of these various characteristics without t. 
peculiar grouping into Families being involved. B 
the truth seems to be that in order to their perfecti 
these qualities must be concentrated on a few defini 
objects, which again must not be arbitrarily give 
but must form an integral part of life. The man w 
takes protection in the abstract for his function m 
form an admirable Don Quixote, but he achieves
-P-A-G-E-249
CHAP. X PSYCHOLOGY OF FAMILY LIFE 243 
higher quality who concentrates upon his wife and 
children, and does a better work in the world; while 
for the majority of men it is safe to say that in the 
absence of wife and children their protective instincts 
will either remain undeveloped or be turned upon 
themselves alone. 
It is true, again, that the children with whom the 
world is overflowing may arouse a somewhat vague 
philanthropy in a considerable number of people, and 
we know to our cost what little good and what great 
harm may be wrought by this loose and aimless affec- 
tion. It takes a particular child to elicit the tender 
wisdom and love which alone suffices to meet the 
eeds of childhood, and in the great majority of people 
      
   
   
    
   
   
    
    
   
   hat peculiar tenderness is elicited (in its perfection) 
nly by the child that is born-of their own flesh 
nd blood. There are many women, and still more 
en, in whom the children of other people raise at 
est a transitory interest and amusement, which easily 
hanges into positive dislike if they are brought at 
oo close quarters with them, or called upon to make 
ny sacrifice of convenience for them. They may be 
duced to subscribe to an orphanage, but would re- 
udiate with mingled disgust and terror the suggestion 
hat they should take charge of a baby for the day, or 
ake themselves responsible for personally bringing 
p a child to manhood or womanhood. But all the 
possibility disappears and the sacrifice becomes a 
rivilege when they find themselves the possessors 
a child of their own. There is no pride in the 
orld to equal that of parents over their first child,
-P-A-G-E-250
244 THE FAMILY PART I 
and nothing short of this pride is strong enough t¢ 
break down the barriers in which some natures ar¢ 
entrenched, and leave the way free for the appeal o: 
infancy to make itself felt. 
It is this same relation of parent to child which in 
the vast majority of cases ensures that authority wil 
be exercised without degenerating into tyranny. That 
it is not always so is obvious; and it is as easy as it 
is futile to point out instances where the Family has 
failed to achieve its full purpose. The Family afford: 
scope for the qualities peculiar to the relations betweer 
strong and weak, old and young, male and female. 
and tends to deepen and accentuate them. Whether 
or not it exaggerates them will depend upon whether 
the spiritual forces in the Family have been well or il! 
balanced. The child who is never encouraged tc 
develop his own initiative and assert his own indivi 
dualities, the woman whose flexibility is subduec 
into feebleness, the man whose strength is perverte 
into tyranny, are all products of an ill-balance 
family life. But where the spiritual forces are welll 
balanced within the Family, then, out of all the stres 
and strain arise qualities of mutual respect, forbear 
ance, and self-control which the solitary individu 
has but little chance of acquiring. 
But, it may be asked, if all we get from famil 
life is this peculiar intensification of feeling and the 
varieties of qualities, and if the world would othe 
wise carry on as well without it, why cultivate an 
protect it so sedulously? Why not rather sweep 
away as a narrow-minded and exclusive organisatio
-P-A-G-E-251
  CHAP. X PSYCHOLOGY OF FAMILY LIFE 245 
and let every citizen know that his first and last 
ulegiance is to the State? 
The answer is, that even if the world could carry 
on without the Family, it could not afford to lose the 
qualities which would go with it. It is a sombre 
world as it is, and no shade or tone of feeling which 
makes for depth and variety and richness can be 
spared from it. To reject the source of so much 
warmth and beauty because it sometimes fails, would 
be like banishing the sun from the sky because it is 
sometimes covered with clouds. 
Nor is it true that the world would carry on as 
well without it. Apart from the fact that no one 
has ever yet devised an adequate substitute for a 
parent,’ the further fact remains that the Family, 
with its mingled diversity and identity of interests, 
is the best—if not indeed the only—school for the 
ife of the citizen. In a brilliant essay on the Institu- 
ion of the Family, Mr. Chesterton writes of it : “The 
an who lives in a small community lives in a much 
arger world. He knows much more of the fierce 
arieties and uncompromising divergencies of men. 
he reason is obvious. In a large community we can 
hoose our companions. In a small community our 
companions are chosen for us. Thus in all extensive 
nd highly-civilised societies groups come into exist- 
nce founded upon what is called sympathy, and shut 
ut the real world more sharply than the gates of a 
onastery. There is nothing really narrow about the 
1 A human parent, that is: the artificial ‘‘ foster-mother” seems to do 
ell enough for chicks, but then they have no higher qualities to develop.
-P-A-G-E-252
246 THE FAMILY PART I 
clan, the thing which is really narrow is the clique 
The men of the clan live together because they all wea 
the same tartan and are all descended from the sam 
sacred cow; but in their souls, by the divine luck o 
things, there will always be more colours than in any 
tartan. But the men of the clique live togethe 
because they have the same kind of souls, and thei 
narrowness is a narrowness of spiritual coherence anc 
contentment, like that which exists in hell.” 
It is probably a mistake to suppose that clique 
are ever based so deeply as to touch soul-depth at all 
it is rather because of their superficiality that they ar 
so fatal. But there is no doubt about the fact tha 
the man who has learned how to lead both an indi 
vidual and a peaceful life within a large Family wil 
find it surprisingly easy to get on with his fellow 
citizens in the larger world, for he will have learnec 
the difficult art of respecting the interests of other 
while maintaining his own. 
If we pass now to the question of those character 
istics which members of a Family possess because they 
are members of that Family, we are brought face t 
face with all the unsolved problems of heredity. I 
is not necessary for our purpose to discuss the variou 
explanations of the mystery ; we need only to assum 
what I think no one will deny, that members of th 
same Family do tend to reproduce within themselve| 
the same qualities to a greater extent than member 
of different Families. It does not follow that thos 
peculiarly family characteristics always tend to th 
strengthening of family life; they may sometime:
-P-A-G-E-253
cHAp,. x PSYCHOLOGY OF FAMILY LIFE 247 
even often, lead to the dispersion rather than the 
concentration of its members in continued proximity; 
but even then they constitute a sort of negative unity 
which is always longing back, and cannot find per- 
manent satisfaction in dispersion. 
When we are accustomed to see or deal with people 
in great numbers, it is difficult not to lose sight of 
the significance of this factor in human nature. And 
indeed, just in proportion as we attempt to handle 
people in masses it tends to lose its significance and 
its helpfulness as a means of education. A striking 
instance of this oversight is to be found in an other- 
ise excellent study of boy life in London, when the 
uthor writes of the Family as follows: “ The Family 
ircle is a world in miniature, with its own habits, its 
wn interests, and its own ties, largely independent 
f the great world that lies outside. If we take to 
ieces this small world, we shall find that it is built 
ut of certain elements, some apparently significant, 
thers more imposing, but all alike contributing its 
hare in the general effect. It is these elements which 
dmit of preservation and destruction. So far as 
egards the boy—and with him alone am I directly 
oncerned—these factors of home life may be divided 
mto six classes: the common dwelling, the common 
          
      
    
    
    
    
      
    eals, the home training, his recreation (including 
omestic employment), his relations with the other 
embers of the family, and, finally, the work for which 
e receives wages. Under one or other of these six 
lasses all the activities of the family can be grouped. 
he Family sentiment is a product of these different
-P-A-G-E-254
248 THE FAMILY PART II 
factors, and varies as they vary, expanding or con- 
tracting with these contributing elements. Thus its 
present condition may be determined and its future 
predicted by an examination of these six more or less 
independent forces.” 
Even if the family sentiment were merely the pro- 
duct of such simple elements as these, capable of 
being taken to pieces and put together again like the 
bits of a dissecting puzzle, the writer need hardly 
have come to such a despondent conclusion as he does 
as to its power to maintain itself amidst the changing 
conditions of society. It is possible to describe the 
most beautiful music as merely the product of a 
particular combination of catgut and wood; but the 
music is more permanent than the mechanical means 
by which it is produced, and the family sentiment 
may outlive indefinitely the physical conditions i 
which it has originated. But important as the factor 
enumerated are, they are not all. If they were, i 
would be easy to make artificial Families out of an 
human material which came to hand, and all th 
great problems which centre round the question o 
heredity would be meaningless. For that question i 
just this—what is the nature of the mysterious lin 
which binds together generation to generation, an 
individuals of the same generation in one indissolubl 
whole, and which no physiologist or psychologist ha: 
ever yet been able to explain? What is the natur 
of the sway which our ancestors exert over us, so tha 
at times we seem utterly incapable of freeing our 
selves from the passions and proclivities which, as ij
-P-A-G-E-255
cHap.x PSYCHOLOGY OF FAMILY LIFE 249 
his is said, we have “inherited from them”? It is an 
inheritance, moreover, which we cannot take or leave 
as we will, and one which would seem never to wear 
out. The mingling with other Families may modify 
the family characteristics, or substitute others for 
them, indefinitely, for generations, and then suddenly 
the original type reasserts itself in all its vigour, and 
it is as if some long dead ancestor had come to life 
again. Implicitly or explicitly, potentially or actu- 
ally, the family characteristics are there in every 
member of the Family, capable of reasserting themselves 
in every new generation, and forming the material 
from which each one of us has to mould his life 
and character. How is it possible that such a force 
as this, little as it may be realised or understood, 
should not be the main factor influencing family 
life? both the bond which holds its members together, 
whether they like it or not, and their chief source of 
spiritual strength. The family type is the theme, of 
which the individual members are the variations— 
variations sometimes so changed and complex that 
lonly the trained ear can grasp the fundamental theme, 
land sometimes so broadly simple that every passing 
istener is caught and smiles to hear the same old 
une repeating itself, And however strange and 
ubtle the variations, members of the Family them- 
elves always recognise the theme running below; 
hey are never wholly strange to one another; the 
hords respond, or echo, or clash, as the case may be. 
It does not follow that these fundamental identities 
lways lead to superficial harmony. A plain person 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
250 THE FAMILY PART II 
finds no attraction in a mirror; and a person sensitive 
to his own defects of character may be inexpressibly 
jarred by seeing them reflected in another. I have 
known mothers whose irritation at the faults of their 
children was greatly enhanced by the fact that they 
recognised them as merely the faults of their own 
childhood recurring once again. And we fear no 
critic as we do the critic of our own Family, for has 
he not the key to all our weaknesses within himself ? 
The stranger may be hostile and severe, but we can 
always console ourselves with the thought—which in 
nine cases out of ten will be perfectly true—that he 
does not really understand us. It is not being mis- 
understood which hurts most; it is being understood 
at our weakest, just as what helps the most is being 
understood at our best. And the member of our 
Family understands us literally “ down to the ground,” 
for it is the same ground upon which he himself 
stands. 
Here, too, we may perhaps find an explanation| 
of the strange bitterness which so often seems to 
attach to differences of opinion between members o 
the same Family. When an outsider differs from uw 
we can accept it as something to be explained awa: 
by differences of experience, of surroundings, of educa   tion, above all of inherited temperament and disposi, 
tion; in a sense it is possible to think of each bein 
so far right that his opinion is the natural outcom 
of the sort of person he is. But when our brothe 
differs from us there is no such escape from discord 
this, we feel uneasily, is the same sort of person a:
-P-A-G-E-257
cHar. x PSYCHOLOGY OF FAMILY LIFE 251 
ourselves, his opinion proceeds from the same nature 
as our own, and we cannot see any reason for the 
conflict. It is as if one’s own judgment were divided 
against itself. 
We find the same bitterness attaching to “ family 
quarrels,” especially amongst people of strong and 
undisciplined feelings. A slight or an injury from 
some one within the circle may wound and rankle 
far more than from some one without, just because 
we think that there we ought to be safe. To the 
outside world we can wear the armour of reserve, but 
this avails us nothing where all that is covered by 
        
    
     
   
   
   
    
   the armour is already known, and every weak point 
lies open. And the plea which may be accepted 
from the stranger, “I did not know that it would 
urt you so,” only deepens the wound when it comes 
from the brother who surely should have known. 
‘* Have you ever noticed,” writes a friend who has 
reat opportunities of observing life amongst the less 
ducated working classes, “‘ how implacable the people 
own here are with each other. For some slight 
ause offence is taken, and ever after they live apart.

street. They often meet him on Sundays when they 
are coming home from chapel. They are ‘dressy’ 
girls, and his mother says he would like to know 
them now; but his sisters disdain him and ‘look 
through him.’ We find many similar cases. Often 
one member of the family succeeds in life, and the 
other members are too proud to go where they are 
not wanted. They seem to have the old-fashioned 
primitive feelings of ‘envy, malice, and all un- 
charitableness’ very badly.” 
If we turn again for a moment to Mr. Chesterton’s 
essay, we find him defending the Family on this very 
ground of its discords: “The modern writers who 
have suggested, in a more or less open manner, that 
the family is a bad institution, have generally con- 
fined themselves to suggesting, with much sharp- 
ness, bitterness, or pathos, that perhaps the family is 
not always very congenial. Of course the famil 
is a good institution because it is uncongenial. I 
is wholesome precisely because it contains so man: 
divergencies and varieties. It is, as the senti 
mentalists say, like a little kingdom, and, like mos 
other little kingdoms, is generally in a state of some. 
thing resembling anarchy. It is exactly because ou 
brother George is not interested in our religious diffi 
culties, but is interested in the Trocadero Restaurant 
that the family has something of the bracing qualitie 
of the commonwealth. It is precisely because ou 
Uncle Henry does not approve of the theatric: 
ambitions of our sister Sarah that the family i 
like humanity. The men and women who, for goo
-P-A-G-E-259
cHAaP.x PSYCHOLOGY OF FAMILY LIFE 253 
reasons and bad, revolt against the family, are, for good 
reasons and bad, simply revolting against mankind.” 
Now I venture to think that the author has 
overlooked the real reason why these divergencies 
and varieties may be so great a source of irritation 
within the Family. It is not mainly because we are 
forced into close contact with people who differ from 
ourselves: Uncle Henry probably sees very little of 
our sister Sarah. It is not even that we disapprove 
of there being people who differ from ourselves: 
Uncle Henry probably has no foolish prejudices 
against actresses in general. It is something much 
ore subtle, much more difficult to see clearly and 
vercome. It is the perplexing anomaly that these 
elations of ours, whom we know to be fundamentally 
kin to ourselves, should develop varieties of tastes 
nd capacities which we have not developed; still 
ore that they should have failed to develop tastes 
hich we have developed, and which seems so natural 
nd inevitable to us. We feel as if there must be 
omething queer either about them or about us; as if 
hey had disappointed our well-justified expectations, 
r were making claims upon our sympathies which 
ust be unjustifiable, since we do not feel able to 
eet them. So that even these occasional discords 
re in themselves a proof of the unity which they 
iolate. Their very intensity bears witness to the 
rength of the feeling against which they have to 
ruggle, and which generally prevails in the long run. 
And where, as so often happens, such discord 
ither never arises or is effectually resolved, there we 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
254 THE FAMILY PART II 
have in the family life the fruits of the spirit in all 
their perfection. When children have learned in the 
nursery the lesson of mutual forbearance, and are 
neither exacting nor selfish, then free scope is allowed 
for the fundamental unity, the “family theme,” to 
make itself felt in and through all its diverse varia- 
tions. Within such a Family intercourse is on a 
different basis, is of another quality from what it is 
between members of different Families; the very 
language used takes on a shape of its own which 
may be hardly intelligible outside. Partly, no doubt, 
its mystery consists in allusions to experiences shared 
in common, and needing the merest hint to call them 
to mind, which are a sealed book to the outsider; 
but partly also it is the outcome of the fact that 
certain quaintnesses of expression and turns of 
thought appeal to, or represent, certain fundamenta 
characteristics shared in by all members of th 
Family. To the outsider these expressions and turn’ 
of thought seem meaningless or silly; and it is fo: 
this reason that the family slang or patois, which 
believe nearly every family possesses, is so sedulousl 
concealed from the world at large. 
But whether it finds expression in peculiarities o} 
language or not, few will question the fact of th 
greater ease of intercourse between members of thi 
same Family. Perhaps we realise it most strong] 
on the frequent occasions when what seems to 
quite a simple straightforward expression of feelin; 
or statement of fact is met by the blankness 
incomprehension on the part of our acquaintance, an|
-P-A-G-E-261
cHar.x PSYCHOLOGY OF FAMILY LIFE 255 
all the embarrassments and difficulties of explana- 
tion have to be faced. Within the Family none of 
these are needed; thought leaps to meet thought, 
half a sentence is enough to indicate what we are 
feeling or thinking ; at times indeed we feel ruefully 
the actual impossibility of concealing our thoughts 
or feelings. Exaggerations, again, can be indulged 
in freely, for they will unfailingly be discounted at 
their true value, or something less; expressions of 
momentary irritation will not be mistaken for ex-    
         
    
   
    
     
        
   pressions of deep-seated resentment; and a glance of 
the eye or movement of the hand is enough to guard 
against misinterpretation. 
In addition to this quickness of comprehension, 
which implies more or less of an intellectual unity, 
there is an even stronger unity of feeling or emotion. 
It is generally quite unnecessary for one member of 
he Family to tell another what he thinks or feels 
in the way of approval or disapproval, to “give him 
piece of his mind” is to give him what he has 
lready got; even the child has no need of outward 
igns to tell him when he is “in disgrace,” and the 
ise mother refrains from reproach when she is 
ngered, knowing that to express her feeling in 
anguage is more likely to weaken than to strengthen 
er child’s perception of it. 
It is this unity of feeling again, which gives the 
ominant tone to a family life. Its members respond 
o the same appeals, their sympathies are aroused 
yy the same causes. They are philanthropic, or 
ntellectual, or religious, or artistic, or social; if any
-P-A-G-E-262
256 THE FAMILY PART 1 
member fails to share in the family interests, he is 
noted at once as an exception, and in the long run 
the family feeling is generally too much for him, and 
he develops philanthropy or religion in his old age 
with a sense of the inevitable upon him. 
How real and strong a thing this unity of feeling 
is may be seen when some joy or sorrow falls upon 
some one member of a Family. We say it falls upon 
him, but it cannot fall upon him alone; what hurts 
one, hurts all, though sometimes in less degree, and 
any joy which comes to one touches all, it may be 
with a delight which is purer than that of the direct 
recipient. For him it is probably true that the new 
happiness brings with it new responsibilities and 
difficulties and complications, but to his Family i 
comes unshadowed by these, a joy in which they cai 
participate with unalloyed content. And never per. 
haps is the unity of feeling more strongly felt tha 
when through the fortunes of some one member th 
Family rises or falls in the estimation of the out 
side world. As it is with happiness, so too wit 
honours. To the man who earns them they ma 
bring a heavy burden, which the Family participatin 
escapes entirely. But the Family knows well enoug 
that it is by virtue of zs strength, the nature whic. 
aw has imparted to its members, that success has bee 
achieved; and it can rightly share in the honow 
while ignoring the cost to the individual which sue 
a realisation of its nature involves. 
Disgrace also it must share. In vain may on 
who has brought disgrace upon the name he bea
-P-A-G-E-263
HAP. X PSYCHOLOGY OF FAMILY LIFE 257 
srotest that it concerns himself alone ; he knows at 
1eart that it is no mere convention which makes his 
family suffer for his fault. That a member of the 
family, sharing in its common nature, partaking in 
ts impulses, instincts, sentiments, and education, 
san have done this thing—it is that which wounds 
leeper than all the scorn or pity from outside, for it 
eveals possibilities unrealised before. There is a 
sort of justice in the fact that the Family should fall 
n public estimation, since the family nature has 
shown itself capable of falling; and the culprit must 
idd to his responsibilities the fact that he has shaken 
hat self-esteem of the Family which may have done 
nuch to make its members strong. 
There may be cases where this diminution of self- 
steem is to some extent a gain. The criticism that 
they think too much of themselves” is not un- 
equently justified by a Family with a keen sense 
f its virtues ; and more may be gained than lost by 
shock which reveals to it its hidden weaknesses. 
ut this trust in the nature which we share with our 
rothers is a very strong element in the bond which 
olds the members of the Family together, and may 
ot be lightly sinned against. The deeds which we 
ink impossible to us, we never dream of imputing 
our brother; where we feel no temptation our- 
Ives, no suspicion arises with reference to him; it 
our own weaknesses which we expect him to share, 
d even here we generally expect him to be stronger 
resist than we are ourselves. And out of this 
utual trust in important matters, though it may

258 THE FAMILY PART I 
never find expression in words, springs a strengtl 
of attachment which is hardly realised in norma 
daily intercourse, but proves itself on the occasion: 
when life touches its heights or depths. 
But in every Family there are two members wh« 
have not started from this common ground of the 
Family nature. Husband and wife must win thei 
way by conscious steps to the unity from whicl 
brother and sister start unconsciously ; and just fo: 
this reason it is when won so much richer, so mucl 
more vividly and intensely realised. They meet as 
strangers, each attracted by the mystery of a natur 
as yet unknown, but promising in some rare anc 
wonderful way to be not the repetition but the com 
pletion of his own. And when the promise is fulfilled 
then through the whole tale of married life maj 
run the golden interest of exploring new depths o 
character, of the revelation of new treasures, of th 
discovery of new strength to uphold the other’ 
weakness; while at every step of mutual discover 
the bond becomes stronger, the two themes blen 
more completely, discords find their end in harmonie: 
and two become one beyond the possibility of di 
solution. With others of our friends we seldom pas 
beyond the threshold; we know that there ar 
treasures within, but we have not the key whic 
will unlock the treasure-house; we cannot ente 
they cannot let us in. We respect their achiev 
ments, sympathise with their fortunes, share the 
interests; but these things, vital as they are, yie 
us nothing like the unity of Family life unle 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
cHAP. x PSYCHOLOGY OF FAMILY LIFE 259 
we can penetrate to the nature from which they 
spring. 
There is, I think, no doubt, that when for any 
reason the Family is dissolved while its members are 
still young, when the children are brought up apart 
from each other and amongst strangers, these family 
characteristics tend to be diminished. The common 
nature may assert itself if they meet in later life ; 
but it develops most freely in the daily intercourse 
of characters which are in the process of forming. 
[he question thus arises whether it may not be an 
advantage for children to be removed from the narrow 
circle within which all their peculiarities of tempera- 
ment and disposition are daily reinforced, and brought 
into contact with other natures where they may “rub 
heir edges off” before the process becomes quite so 
ainful as in after-life. The answer seems to be that 
or the community, at any rate, it cannot be an 
dvantage, so long as individuality and variety of 
hharacter remain of value. The strength of a nation 
oes not lie, like that of an army, in the uniformity 
f its members, but in the variety and strength of 
lhe different characters which can be brought to work 
armoniously within it; and it is in the Family that 
is variety and strength of character is nourished.

CHAPTER XI 
THE CONSTITUENT PARTS OF THE FAMILY 
I. Toe Man in THE Famity 
Tue first question which suggests itself in connection 
with the actual function of the man at the present 
day and in the modern Family, is that of his 
authority. Bearing in mind our survey of the 
past, we may ask: How does the father of a modern 
Family stand as compared with his ancestors in 
respect of the authority which he exercises? He 
is still recognised as the Head of the Family, but 
when we ask whether this position carries with it 
the power which it used to carry, and upon what 
his power, such as it is, is based, we are forced te 
recognise great changes. When, for instance, we 
take that authority in its most exaggerated for 
but at its lowest level amongst the most primitiv 
peoples of all, we find it based mainly upon th 
man’s superior physical strength, upon brute force 
and tending: to last just so long as his strengt 
enables him to maintain it. Upon this basis hi 
authority over his wife is absolute and permanent 
over his children it is absolute, but only until th 
260
-P-A-G-E-267
  CHAP. XI THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 261 
time comes when they are stronger than he. But 
in the modern Family physical strength counts for 
comparatively little. Except amongst the roughest 
and most uncivilised classes, pli pn is too 
strongly against the man who cannot maintain his 
authority without recourse to violence for physical 
strength to be a factor of any importance in support- 
ing the rule of man. Moreover, public opinion has 
found clear and authoritative expression in the law; 
the State has not only ceased to recognise the father’s 
right to inflict corporal injuries upon members of 
   
     
        
    
     
    
       is Family, it definitely intervenes to protect them 
against cruelty on his part. Perhaps we may still 
nd traces of the old view in the leniency with 
hich the offence of wife-beating is punished; but 
he fact remains that it is punished, and not 
ecognised as the legitimate means of enforcing 
uthority. 
Again, in a far more advanced state of society, 
e found in the priestly function of the Head of 
he Patriarchal Family the basis of an authority 
he most complete and permanent that has ever 
een known. Does anything remain of this? 
eligious ceremonial has long ceased to be a 
rivate family affair; it has been taken over and 
rganised by the churches, and though some of its 
riests adopt the name of father, fathers are no 
longer allowed to call themselves priests. And yet 
he priestly function lingers to some extent. It is 
till the Head of the Family who “reads prayers” ; 
nd in the absence of any strong reason to the
-P-A-G-E-268
  262 THE FAMILY PART 0 
contrary, it is the father who determines what the 
religion of the Family will be. Riehl insists upon 
this. “If I am asked,” he writes, “‘why are you 
a Protestant?’ I can only answer, and there seems 
to me nothing superficial in the answer, because 
my father was a Protestant. I am a Protestant 
by conviction, but I should never have attained 
to this conviction unless I had grown up amongst 
Protestant views and ideas, unless my family had 
been Protestant; thus my religious belief, of all 
things apparently most peculiarly my own, has been 
essentially inoculated into me through the authority 
of the Family. Hence the ordinary man regards 
the falling away from the faith of one’s fathers 
as particularly disgraceful, because it involves the 
greatest renouncing of the Family.”? (In Families. 
then, where religion is a living force, it can hardly 
fail to be that the authority of the father is 
strengthened and raised to a higher level by the 
fact that he is the medium through which member 
of his Family have come: to hold the faith that i 
in them.) And so far as this is the basis of hi 
authority, it will tend to be permanent ; but religio: 
itself, in its insistence upon personal freedom an 
responsibility, will limit it and make it but th 
faint reflection of the paternal power from whic 
it is descended. 
In less developed communities, again, we foun 
the authority of the father based upon his superio 
wisdom and experience, in the absence of any accum 
1 Richl, Die Familie.
-P-A-G-E-269
  CHAP. XI THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 263 
ulated and accessible store of knowledge. He was 
the teacher and adviser of the young, who looked 
to him for guidance in their inexperience. But this 
function also has to a large extent been taken from 
him; and education has been organised in books 
and schools in such a way as to make the young 
apparently independent of their parents in the 
acquisition of knowledge. But here the change 
has been largely apparent; the wisdom of life, the 
art of living, as distinct from book learning and 
knowledge about things, still rests with those who 
have lived, and can rarely be taught in books or 
      
    
   
        
    
   
         
     schools. ‘The fathers who recognise this prerogative 
of theirs and all that is involved in it, find in it 
one of the surest bases of authority; it is to them, 
and not to books, that their sons will turn when 
they are first confronted with problems in life which 
call for wisdom and experience in their solution. 
Still another function has been taken from the 
[Head of the Family in that he is seldom now the 
head also of an industrial community. The authority 
delegated to him in that capacity in agricultural 
communities would be indistinguishable from his 
authority as a father; the respect paid to his 
commands as a master from that paid to his com- 
mands as a father. But the modern Family has 
argely, though not entirely, ceased to be an 
industrial community, and so far another basis of 
aternal authority has disappeared. 
Closely allied to this last is the authority which 
the Head of the Family derives from his power over
-P-A-G-E-270
    264 THE FAMILY PART I 
the family estate. How this power has varied 
throughout the history of the Family, and how 
its variations have affected the relations between 
different members of the Family, we have already 
seen. It still lingers in an attenuated form in 
the feudal Families which remain; and the father’s 
authority in these Families may vary in proportion 
as he has freedom of control over the property, 
But it is in the more strictly modern Family, 
where property is apt to be regarded as appertain- 
ing entirely to the individual, that this power 
suddenly springs into importance again, and becomes 
°a formidable weapon in the hands of the father who 
can find no better basis for his authority. The 
power of the purse, “the power to cut off allow: 
‘ances or to disinherit, is strong; but it is strong 
only in proportion as those who are subjected to 
it are weak; it is a tyranny which can be cast 
off as soon as its victims find the sources of 
independence within themselves. The only true 
and firm basis of authority must be one which 
finds a response in the natures of those over whom 
the authority is exercised; and the power of the 
purse, like that of brute force, elicits no response, 
only subjection. 
It is only amongst the wealthy minority that 
this spurious power has any force to speak of] 
The majority of the English race aims, as we 
have said, less at endowing their children with the 
material for subsistence than with the capacity o 
obtaining that subsistence for themselves; and i  
-P-A-G-E-271
CHAP. XI THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 265 
might be argued that in thus promoting the early 
ndependence of their children, fathers were relin- 
{uishing their strongest hold upon them. However 
shat may be, an early independence is almost — 
iniversal for the boys of a middle or working- 
lass Family, and increasingly so for the girls, 
ulthough for the latter domestic subjection, based 
on the power of the purse, remains not uncommon. 
Taking the matter in this way, and seeking to 
ind a basis for parental authority in the relics of 
past institutions, it would seem as if Time had been 
purely destructive; and as if what we had left to us 
was little more than a tradition, ready to crumble 
away altogether at the shock of any further change. 
But if we take it differently and seek rather for the 
positive element in the present, we shall find that 
she action of Time has been one of change, it is true, 
ut of change in the sense of development rather 
han of destruction. 
To begin with, we must, in studying our modern 
amily, distinguish between two kinds of submission. 
here is the submission which implies a tyranny, 
ased upon the weakness and impotence of its 
ictims; and there is the submission which may 
e expressed as loyalty, and which implies a rule 
liciting a response from the highest qualities of 
hose who are subject to it. Now the develop- 
ent of the modern Family has been almost entirely 
the direction of eliminating those elements which 
ad to the first kind of submission, and of strengthen- 
1g those which lead to loyalty. 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
266 THE FAMILY PART I 
Take, for instance, the change implied in th 
present devotion of the parents to the interests anc 
welfare of the children, as compared with the time: 
when children were regarded as entirely subservien' 
to the aims of the parents or the cult of th 
ancestors. It is true, of course, that there ar 
still Families where the interests of the childrei 
are almost entirely neglected, but they are nov 
abnormal, and instance a degradation from the type 
The trend of modern development is to throw th 
weight of interest on to the rising generation. I 
is obvious, no doubt, that this leaves more scop 
for the play of selfish and egotistical instincts o1 
the part of the children, but it also leaves scop 
for a far higher order of response than that o 
mere submission. Gratitude forms a part of thi 
response; but it is something different from anc 
more than gratitude. There is an unconsciou! 
spontaneity about it which wholly precludes th 
sense of burdensomeness which may attach to mer 
gratitude; and it is unlimited by any question o 
proportion between the benefits mutually conferre 
and received. Moreover, loyalty is a principle whic! 
is active in children long before the time whe 
they begin to realise what they have owed to thei 
parents’ care and effort. The normal child in th 
normal Family accepts everything which comes t 
him in the ordinary course of the home life wit 
a sublime unconsciousness of any sacrifice bein 
involved. It is a part of his loyalty to his paren 
that he leaves it all to them, with full confiden
-P-A-G-E-273
  CHAP. XI THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 267 
that they will be equal to every occasion, In 
proportion as he himself begins to share in the 
family responsibilities, he will begin also to realise 
what he has owed to them; but an adequate know- 
ledge can only come when he has felt the full burden 
of life, and when, if his sense of loyalty has been 
unimpaired, he is already a willing minister to the 
claims of the Family. And the father, as the 
originator, the organiser, the support, the author 
of the Family, will seldom fail of the loyalty of 
its members unless he himself by his unwisdom 
or tyranny has destroyed the respect in which it 
is rooted. 
In so far as the authority of the parent is based 
upon a greater maturity of reasonable will, it must 
always exist until such time as the will of the child 
is itself rationalised and matured. This lies in the 
nature of things, and is no more than to say that 
where two forces combine, the strongest will have 
most influence in determining the result. There 
is no tyranny involved in this when the purpose 
and aim of the parents includes the welfare of the 
Family, for then they are but guiding the will of the 
child to attain an end which it is as yet incapable 
f conceiving and attaining for itself. “We are 
orn free as we are born rational,” writes John 
ocke, “not that we have actually the use of 
ither; age that brings one, brings with it the 
ther too. And thus we see how natural freedom 
nd subjection to parents may consist together, and 
re both founded on the same principle. A child
-P-A-G-E-274
  268 THE FAMILY PART I 
is free by his father’s title, by his father’s under 
standing, which is to govern him till he hath it 
of his own. The freedom of a man at years o 
discretion, and the subjection of a child to his 
parents, while yet short of it, are so consistent anc 
so distinguishable that the most blinded contender: 
for monarchy ‘by right of fatherhood’ cannot mis: 
of it ; the most obstinate cannot but allow of it.”? 
When we consider the relation between man anc 
wife in the modern Family it seems to me mor 
especially true that this idea of loyalty—both t 
each other and to a common purpose—is the only 
one which adequately represents it. The day is pas' 
when the patient Griselda, ready with unreasonins 
submission for every tyrannical command of he 
despotic husband, was extolled as fulfilling the 
highest ideal of wifely duty. Disobedience might 
be considered as reprehensible as ever, but a larg 
share of the blame would be reserved for the husbanc 
who should make conformity to his will a frequent 
problem. In place of despotism on the one side anc 
submission on the other, we find the willing loyalty 
which recognises that if two wills conflict in thei 
pursuit of a common purpose, then the will whicl 
called the Family into being, and which is primaril) 
responsible for its welfare, must in the interests o 
the Family be supreme. But self-assertion, self 
realisation, cease to be hostile forces when each o 
the selves concerned is seeking the fulfilment of it 
purposes, its own fullest realisation, in a commot

nd, whether that end be the family life or some 
ther and perhaps wider. 
Another reason for the continued authority of the 
nan within the Family is the fact that he continues

world. He acts for the Family, stands for the Family, 
yives his name to the Family, and is the legal and 
vuthorised representative of the Family. And he is 
1eld responsible to the community of which he is a 
member for the proper maintenance, conduct, and 
ipbringing of the Family which he has called into 
xistence. There is only one curious exception to 
his representative character of the man; it is that 
n Society he has no official value. It is true, no 
loubt, that his rank determines the particular 
‘circle” within which the Family will “move”; 
yut the movements themselves, in order to be valid, 
nust be performed by the woman. In society inter- 
ourse (a somewhat different matter from social inter- 
course) the woman only is accepted as representative 
ind. official; it is she who must organise recognised 
ospitality, must be the dispenser of invitations, must 
itiate or reject acquaintanceships, and—quaintest 
nection of all—must “ pay the calls.” The man, of 
jourse, may and does participate in all these functions, 
ut he cannot discharge them; all that he does in 
is connection is unofficial and does not count. 
Apart from this one convention, however, his 
sponsibility to the world is complete, from the 
oment when she whom he has chosen for his 
artner is “given” to him in marriage, He can

only repudiate it by taking formal and recognised 
steps to do so, and it lasts as long as the Family itself 
remains together as one household. This being so, it 
is clearly necessary and just that he should have 
sufficient authority within the Family to control it 
in those matters for which he is held responsible) 
One of the most important functions which a man 
exercises in a community is that of electing its rulers ; 
and the question has been raised whether he exercises 
his electoral privileges as representative of his Family 
or merely as an individual taxpayer. That able and 
strenuous opponent of the enfranchisement of women, 
W. H. Riehl, maintains that if the right to the 
franchise is based merely upon the taxation of indi- 
viduals, then there is no justification for the exclusion 
of women. But he also maintains the true theory o: 
political representation to be that the State represent 
not individuals but Families; and that the woman 
as part of the Family, is adequately represented by 
the vote of the Head of the Family. “The man is 
not only the legal guardian of the household; it is 
through him alone that all which the household doe: 
for education and morality is extended to wider circles 
is made public property. Where the marriage is « 
true one, spiritually equal and morally complete, there 
are always two persons contributing to the highest 
thoughts and opinions of the man—himself and hi: 
wife. In this lofty and pure sense all true wives 
are represented in Parliament when the husband sit: 
there.” * 
1 Riehl, Die Familie, p. 103.
-P-A-G-E-277
HAP. XI THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 271 
But Riehl is clear-sighted enough to see that this 
heory involves the limitation of the franchise to 
leads of Families, and he is prepared accordingly 
o grant it only to husbands or widowers. The argu- 
rent that a woman is sufficiently represented by her 
usband or father is of course frequently used in 
ingland, especially by those who also maintain that 
o grant her the franchise would cause instant strife 
etween her and her male representatives; but no 
ne, I think, has suggested that the Family as such 
hould be the unit for voting purposes. It is true 
hat in “household suffrage” we have something like 
he idea; but household suffrage admits many single 
nen who represent at most themselves and their 
lomestic servants, while the lodger franchise practi- 
ally abandons the idea of a household as the basis of 
olitical representation. 
In virtue of what prerogative does the man hold 
his supreme place as representative of his Family in 
ecommunity? To ascribe it to his superior physical 
rength will hardly satisfy our modern conceptions, 
my more than to ascribe his authority within the 
amily to the same cause; although the argument 
at woman is disqualified by her incapacity to serve 
the army, which is frequently advanced in Germany, 
proaches perilously near to this. A far more accept- 
le theory to one half of the human race would be 
at the man alone possesses a fully-developed intellect, 
d that by virtue of this he is natural ruler and guide. 
his is, I think, the explanation which would be most 
nerally offered at the present day: almost univer-

sally in Germany, less so perhaps in France, to a larg 
extent in England, least of all in America. Bu 
whether or not it is the case that a woman’s intellec’ 
is never of the highest order, it is becoming increas 
  ingly difficult to maintain with any show of reaso1 
that it may not, with proper education, be as fully 
developed as that of the average man, and the argu 
ment from intellect becomes daily less relevant. 
Nevertheless, it seems neither likely nor desirabl 
that the function of representing the Family shoul 
ever be transferred to the woman during the life 
time of the man. In the numerous cases of widow 
or single women the matter is different; but wher 
the Family is based, as it normally is, upon a partner 
ship, law, convention, and mutual assent have fixe 
upon the man as most suitable for the purpose, no 
only by natural disposition, but also and mainly by 
the natural and necessary division of labour betwee: 
the two chief members of the partnership. Thi 
division of labour, under which a large part of th 
woman’s activities are directed towards domesti 
cares, would in itself suffice to debar her from acquiz 
ing facility in matters of business intercourse. Bu 
the division is essential, and the lines which it follow 
are drawn not so much by the woman’s inability t 
work for her Family in the outside world—she con 
stantly does so when the death or illness of he 
husband throws the double burden upon her; bu 
from the obvious fact that the man is incapable « 
the more domestic duties incident upon the rearin 
of children. And it is largely this incapacity whic

vives him the power both of concentration and of 
width of view. While the woman’s mental energies 
ure being dissipated over the thousand little details 
which are necessary to the successful management of 
1 family, the man’s are free to pursue some line of 
thought, to concentrate on some course of action, to 
organise some business, to frame and follow out some 
policy. 
Now it seems obvious that if man’s predominance 
in the outside world is the natural consequence of a 
recognised division of labour, it should not extend to 
matters which have been assigned by that division 
to the other partner; and as a matter of fact the 
families in which it does so are probably exceptional. 
His authority remains, no doubt, as determining the \ 
basis of the family life, and the main outlines of its |

This more or less roughly describes the divisior 
of work in all classes where the man earns and thé 
woman spends, but it is more opel true amongst 
the wage-earners. ‘‘ Money matters are left entirely 
to the wife; it is she who decides whether an in 
creased rent can be paid or an article of furnitur 
bought, whether a boy shall be apprenticed or mus 
take what work he can find, and what insurance clubs 
te., shall be joined. The custom .of leaving th: 
management of money to the wife is so deeply 
rooted that children always speak of the famil) 
income as belonging entirely to her, and will con 
stantly tell you: ‘Mother has to pay so and so fo: 
rent’; ‘Mother is going to try and afford father thi 
or that’; ‘Mother isn’t going to let father work fo 
Mr. any more, she says the wages isn’t worth thi 
hours.’’ . . . Fathers are regarded by the children a 
plainly inferior to mothers in authority, in knowledg 
of right and wrong, and, above all, of ‘ manners.’ 
Talk of the subjection of women !—I doubt if the bar 
idea of fathers being equal to mothers in rank an 
authority ever enters the mind of any cottage chil 
under sixteen. From their conversation all my littl]     
   friends might be fatherless, except for an occasion

that mother said he ‘hadn’t ought to, and the 
disastrous results of this untimely rebellion. Father 
is generally regarded in the light of mother’s eldest 
child, and disobedience in him is far more heinous a 
crime than in them, because ‘he’d ought to know 
better than not to do what mother says.’ Fathers 
are, as a rule, perfectly satisfied with this position, 
not minding in the least when the youngest born 
publicly raises a note of warning: ‘ Mother said as 
you wasn’t to do that, dad.’”* 
There is one point upon which the position of the 
man in the Family is apt to be gravely misrepresented, 
and that is in his attitude towards, and treatment 
f, the children. Broadly stated, the very common 
ssumption is that he dislikes children, regards them 
s an inevitable encumbrance, and is consistently un- 
ympathetic and often cruel in his dealings with them. 
t is of course against the working class that this libel, 
or libel it is, is most frequently directed. This pessi- 
istic, one might almost call it brutal view, finds 
xpression in one of Sydney Smith’s essays: “A 
loughman marries a ploughwoman because she is 
lump ; generally uses her ill; thinks his children 
          
    
   mn encumbrance; very often flogs them; and, for 
entiment, has nothing more nearly approaching to 
than the ideas of broiled bacon and mashed potatoes. 
his is the state of the lower orders of mankind— 
eplorable but true—and yet rendered much worse 
y the Poor Laws.”

276 THE FAMILY PART II 
This is a view which finds many supporters at the 
present day, and those who hold it pride themselves 
on being freed from sentimental prejudice, and look- 
ing at things “as they really are.” It is due partly, 
no doubt, to the vulgar assumption that “the poor” 
belong indeed to a “ lower order,” in that they do not 
share in the natural affections and virtues which are 
reserved for the moneyed classes, and partly again to 2 
lack of familiarity with the people in their normal and 
healthy relations. It is perhaps the exception fo1 
those who hold this view to come into relation with 
the working classes except in connection with the 
demoralising influences of charity and the Poor Law. 
  and they draw their inferences from the families whick 
these agencies have helped to destroy. But such @ 
view of father and child is contrary to the whol 
history of the human race, which has found no higher 
or more adequate conception in which to express its 
sense of divine loving-kindness than that of father. 
hood. And who will say that the Psalmist had only the 
cultured few in mind when he declared in words whic 
go home to every heart: “Like as a father pitiet 
his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him ” 
To those who have eyes to tol this tenderness o 
the father is to be found in every class of societ 
which still maintains its independence, and certain] 
not less among the poor than among the rich. “Th 
ideal of fatherhood,” writes Miss Loane, “is less de 
veloped among the poor than the ideal of motherhood]

is rarely any attempt at moral training. Neverthe

less, men of the working class are as much libelled as 
fathers as working-class women are as cooks, nurses, 
and managers. In both cases the millions bear the 
blame that is only due to a few tens of thousands. 
Paternal affection may not be very strong after a boy 
has reached his tenth and a girl her twelfth year, but 
it is lavished on them at an age when the circum- 
stances of poor people’s daily lives make it almost 
indispensable for their children’s health and happiness. 
In countless homes the busy, many-childed mother 
breathes freely for the first time in the day when 
her husband returns from work. . . . The honours of 
fatherhood are divided. The professional man gener- 
ally begins to show most attention to his children 
about the time when the working man’s devotion 
slackens. The working man adores children at an 
age when the former would not dare to give his candid 
opinion of them even to a confirmed bachelor.” 
This generalisation cannot, of course, be applied at 
ll rigidly. Towards his own babies, at least, the 
ndifference of the professional man is sometimes only 
ssumed as a cloak to cover the extremity of senti- 
ent with which he regards them. But there is, I 
hink, little doubt that the distinction exists, and 
hat the working man is apt to be more completely 
nabashed in his tenderness for his children. When 
e cares for them at all, there are no reservations 
bout it. Clean or dirty, laughing or crying, asleep 
x awake, quiet or naughty, he adores them in all 
heir moods, and applauds their misdemeanours as 
uch as their virtues. From the point of view of
-P-A-G-E-284
  278 THE FAMIL PART 1 
education this has its drawbacks, and a love with 
more self-restraint would doubtless be both better for 
the children and more enduring; but it enables the 
man to tolerate annoyances which would be intolerable 
to one of finer sensibilities. 
It is partly, no doubt, the possession of more 
highly strung nerves which makes the educated man 
less tolerant of babydom. But partly, also, it is the 
awkwardness and restraint which he feels in the 
presence of the strange creature which forms a barriet 
between him and the baby. He has no means o} 
communication with it; for all practical purposes o: 
intercourse it is deaf and dumb; he does not know 
how it will respond to his advances, nor how to deal 
with its difficulties. In the Family of the working 
man he is forced into close contact with the newcomei 
from its first arrival, and must take his share ir 
ministering to its needs; and thus he learns almost 
as soon as its mother to be on terms of intimacy. 
But in a Family where a nurse takes charge from the 
first, the father’s acquaintance is apt to be limited tc 
amore or less formal introduction, and it may be 
months, or even years, before he feels really at home 
with the stranger whom he has invited to become « 
permanent member of his household. But though it 
may be longer in his case before the channels of com: 
munication can be opened up and the true relation.

about it the possibilities of a permanent friendship o 
the highest type, just because it is based not onl, 
upon instinctive affection.

CHAPTER XII 
THE CONSTITUENT PARTS OF THE FAMILY—continued 
II. Toe-Woman IN THE Famity 
Wirs respect to the proper position and function of 
the woman in the Family there is general agreement 
up to a certain point. If the husband is the head 
of the Family, the wife is the centre. It is she who 
is primarily responsible for the care of the children ; 
to the utmost extent of which the family means will 
allow, it is her duty to see that they are well cared 
for, both physically and morally ; and it is generally 
agreed that this duty can only be properly fulfilled 
by personal attention. The wealthy mother who 
hands over her children to the care of nurses and 
governesses, however highly she may pay these, with- 
out constant and adequate supervision, fails just as 
reprehensibly of her duty as the poorer mother 
whose carelessness or ignorance leaves them wholly 
neglected. It is a duty which cannot be delegated. 
Further, she is responsible for so ordering the 
household that every member of it may have a home 
life which is physically healthy and morally whole- 
some. It is more especially her business to watch 
279
-P-A-G-E-286
  280 THE FAMILY PART II 
over the interests of the weaker members, whether it 
is the backward child in the nursery, or the kitchen- 
maid in the scullery, and to see that all have a 
fair chance of developing whatsoever capacities lie 
in them. 
With regard to finance, again, she has most im- 
portant functions. She may have little to do in 
determining the amount of the family income, but 
even more important than its amount is its right 
distribution, and this should lie mainly within her 
powers. It is for her to judge what things are 
necessaries and must come first, and what things 
are luxuries and may be postponed; and she alone 
can have such an intimate knowledge of the needs of 
each member of the household as to be able to judge 
which are most pressing. And it should be noted 
that in thus determining the distribution of the 
family income she is also performing a national 
function, for by laying down the lines of consump- 
tion she is also laying down the lines of production 
and directing industrial and commercial enterprise. 
Perhaps it is here also that her influence, when 
rightly used, most makes for peace and order in the 
household. When all know that their needs are duly 
appreciated and cared for, there will be little selfish 
clamouring of individuals; and most people will 
cheerfully go without full satisfaction of their wants 
when they know that their claims have been sub- 
ordinated only to claims which are greater. 
And a well-ordered household in this sense is a 
woman’s first duty towards the predominant partner, 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  CHAP. XII THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 281 
her husband. It is this which she tacitly undertakes 
when she enters into partnership with him for the 
important business of carrying on family life; and 
in so far as his own personal comfort is involved in 
this, he has a right to expect it. But that does not 
carry the right to expect that his personal comfort 
shall be the first consideration, and that the woman’s 
duty is primarily to minister to him. The partner- 
ship was formed for mutual help and support in a 
serious undertaking, and when either partner tries to 
make it subserve his private ends alone he is virtually 
guilty of breach of contract. 
It is at this point, the question of how far the 
woman in the Family is to be subservient to man’s 
personal needs, that controversy has generally arisen ; 
and it has its root in the assumption, wholly erroneous 
as I believe, that the interests of men and women are 
in some way inevitably opposed. Whenever the 
question rises of extending or improving women’s 
education, or of giving them wider opportunities of 
work in the outside world, the supporters of the 
movement find themselves confronted by what we 
may call the pseudo-domestic school, who cry out 
that the peace and safety of home life is being 
endangered. Against the argument that women 
would be healthier and happier, both in mind and 
body, if their minds were set free to healthy exercise 
instead of being confined in brooding ignorance, is 
et the argument that man would suffer, that 
oman’s true function is to subordinate herself to 
im, to spend her hours in tending him, or—since  
-P-A-G-E-288
  282 THE FAMILY | PART I 
this might become tiresome—in waiting to tend him 
when he should be inclined for it, to ‘create an 
atmosphere” for his activities, and to be a passive 
receptacle for such of his opinions as he might care tc 
impart. The most consistent exponents of this view 
have always been the Germans :— 
Dienen lerne bei Zeiten das Weib nach ihrer Bestimmung 
Denn durch Dienen allein gelangt sie endlich zum Herrschen 
Zu der verdienten Gewalt, die doch ihr im Hause gehéret. 
Dienet die Schwester dem Bruder doch friih, sie dienet den Eltern, 
Und ihr Leben ist immer ein ewiges Gehen and Kommen, 
Oder ein Heben und Tragen, Bereiten und Schaffen fiir Andre. 
Wohl ihr, wenn sie darum sich gewohnt, dass kein Weg ihr a 
sauer 
Wird und die Stunden der Nacht ihr sind wie die Stunden de 
Tages, 
Dass ihr niemals die Arbeit zu klein und die Nadel zu fein diinkt, 
Dass sie sich ganz vergisst und leben mag nur in anderen !+ 
This ideal, it was thought, could no longer be main 
tained if once women should assert the right o 
independent intellect ; and with it the autocratic lif 
of the man would be shattered. There would ceasi 
to be only one will in the home, and where there ar 
two wills there is the possibility of conflict. Fey 
saw what many now realise, that the old ideal witl 
all its beauty and strength could only be cast dow 
by one still higher and more beautiful; that th 
devotion of women could be greater, not less, wher 
they had richer minds and wiser hearts to give; thai 
the noblest harmonies of life arise when two disciplinec 
and independent wills combine; and that the truest 
comradeship is found when man and woman meet or 
1 Hermann und Dorothea.
-P-A-G-E-289
  CHAP. XII THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 283 
the common ground of mutual intellectual respect. 
Innumerable happy homes bear witness to-day to the 
truth of this higher ideal, and so far the battle has in 
principle been won for ever. 
But it must be admitted that in practice there are 
still many who hold that man can only reach his 
highest by making a stepping-stone of woman. In 
Germany, men, though not regardless of women’s 
welfare, are still eager to prove to them that their 
true welfare lies within the four walls of the home, 
and that real greatness consists in the daily routine 
of household duties. And yet they weary of the 
poor Hausfrau who puts her trust in their teaching 
and faithfully confines her life within the narrow 
limits laid down by them. One of the most plausible 
od convincing of these teachers is Riehl, the socio- 
peel historian, who in his book, Die Familie, 
strenuously advocates the purely domestic theory of 
woman; and it is not a little amusing to find him 
remarking in a‘surprised sort of way how on the 
occasion of some international conference the English 
and Americans brought their wives with them: “A 
German-of cultureavould_rejoice on such an occasion 
toxbe free of his family, and would certainly leave his 
wife at home.” Of course he would; no one wants 
his holidays to be burdened and clouded with an 
epitome of household drudgery ; but it does not seem 
to occur to the writer that a wife capable of intelli- 
gent comradeship might even add to the pleasures of 
a holiday. 
But the same curious shortsightedness seems to
-P-A-G-E-290
ee ome eT et Ean eemm ee tor ae 
) 284 THE FAMILY PART II 
have affected men whenever they have turned their 
attention to considering woman. They complain, 
and with justice, of her narrow-mindedness, her lack 
of intelligent interests, her uncertain temper, her 
frivolity. These all make her a most trying partner 
to live with. But the strange thing is that they 
have so seldom recognised that the remedy is not in 
complaint, but in admitting her to wider interests 
and a more invigorating mental life. “It is false,” 
writes Plutarch, “to say that idle people are cheerful ; 
if so, women would be more cheerful than men, as 
they mostly stay at home; but as it is ‘though the 
north wind may not touch the tender maid,’ yet 
vexation and distraction and ill-feeling, owing to 
jealousy and superstition and innumerable empty 
fancies, find their way into the boudoir.” Tomy mind 
there is something very naive in the way in which 
men have constantly pointed out the ill effects upon 
women of idleness and untrained faculties; they have 
seldom realised that the discomfort they experience 
from these ill effects is, after all, only the natural 
consequence of their own theories about women’s 
education. One would think there had been time 
enough for them to have learned the lesson between 
the days of Plutarch and the eighteenth century ; 
but in 1710 we find a writer in the Guardian 
repeating Plutarch’s complaint almost verbally: “I 
could name you twenty families where all the girls 
hear of in their life is that it is time to rise 
and come to dinner, as if they were so insignificant 
as to be wholly provided for when they are fed and 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  CHAP. XII THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 285 
clothed. It is with great indignation that I see such 
crowds of the female world lost to human society, and 
condemned to a laziness which makes life pass away 
with less relish than in the hardest labour. Palestris 
in her drawing-room is supported by spirits to keep 
off the return of spleen and melancholy before she can 
get over half of the day for want of something to do, 
while the wench in the kitchen sings and scowers 
from morning to night.” He proposes as a remedy 
that “those who are in the quality of gentlewomen 
should propose to themselves some suitable method of 
passing away their time. This would furnish them 
with reflections and sentiments proper for the com- 
panions of reasonable men.” 
Here we have some slight recognition of the fact 
that the interests of men and women are not really 
hostile in this respect, and that a woman is likely to 
be a more amiable as well as a more intelligent com- 
panion if she is not forced to confine her activities 
within the four walls of home and the narrow, if 
absorbing, duties of domestic life. 
But though this recognition is an important step 
forward, the real issue lies deeper still. Granting 
that a wider range of life and thought makes woman 
a pleasanter companion for men, does it do this at the 
cost of her effectiveness as mother and housewife ? 
Is she made less fit for her duties towards the Family 
by taking a greater share in the intellectual and 
practical life of the world? This is the ground upon 
which the question is now being argued by those who 
Ihave advanced beyond the sphere of man’s merely  
-P-A-G-E-292
    286 THE FAMILY PART II 
personal welfare; and the position of the woman in 
the modern Family cannot be fairly stated without 
considering the point. The further question of 
whether woman’s influence in the outside world is 
for good or for evil does not concern us here. 
It is hard to believe that the practical woman of 
trained intelligence should not be a more efficient 
mother and housekeeper than the peevish, hysterical 
creature so often described by men. But considera- 
tions of great weight have been brought forward on! 
the other side, and although some of them are, by 
their nature, incapable either of verification or refuta- 
tion, they must be presented. The following quotation 
from Bliintschli represents what we may call the 
purely dogmatic statement of the pseudo-domestic 
theory. He is arguing against allowing women any 
participation in public affairs :—‘‘ Her proper sphere 
is the life of the family, for which she would be 
unfitted by mixing largely in public duties and 
political struggles. Womanly virtues would suffer,— 
woman’s love as mother and wife, her housewifely 
skill, her fine sensibility and sweetness of character,— 
and there would be no gain in political capacity to 
make good the loss.” ? 
This is, of course, purely dogmatic assertion ; there} 
is no experience forthcoming to show a posteriori that 
the exercise of the franchise or even active service in 
a public capacity would affect women’s power of 
loving, and no @ priori reason to be shown why it 
should; while the housewifely skill might often be

improved by a better business training. The state- 
ment is as incapable of refutation as of proof, 
and must stand simply as an illustration of the 
attitude of mind in which so many able men approach 
the subject. As a more thoughtful exponent of a 
similar view we may turn to Professor Miinsterberg, 
who has made a careful study of the position of 
American women, in his book upon America. Some 
lowance must probably be made for the fact that 
he German and the American mind are of all others

    merican, or even as an Englishman, would do. He 
imself points out that in America the whole principle 
f woman’s life is different from what it is in 
ermany: “In Germany the fundamental principle 
is that woman is meant for marriage, while for man 
arriage is only a side issue in life, and this involves 
rom the first an inequality which can only be slightly 
lessened by those new movements which approximate 
oman to man. In the American, fundamental 
quality is the starting-point.” Hence it comes that 
America a woman’s life is regarded as an end in 
self; she is educated with a view to her own 
evelopment and enjoyment, with the result that she 
o longer seeks in marriage the necessary content and 
ompletion of life. Her disinclination to marriage is 
ften intensified by the fact that she feels herself 
entally superior to the man whose education has 
opped short with his entry into practical life, while 
e has continued her studies in school and college.

288 THE FAMILY PART II 
Add again a growing distaste for the routine of house- 
hold duties, and we have a formidable array of causes 
which tend to reduce women’s inclination for married 
life, and which have doubtless something to do with 
the remarkable fall in the rate of increase of the 
native American population. But our author warns 
us against the theory of the unattractive blue- 
stocking. “Her life at college may make the 
average marriage less attractive to many a young 
American girl; but it certainly has not made hei 
less attractive to the men.” 
It seems necessary in considering this position tc 
distinguish two points. There is, first, the allege 
effect of education in making women less inclined fo 
marriage; and, secondly, whether it makes her les 
competent for the duties of married life when shi 
does assume them. 
It seems to me highly probable, and for the mos 
part wholly to the good, that as women begin t 
have wider interests they will cease to regard marriag 
as the one fact in life which preserves it from bein 
a failure. Amongst a people where there is a larg 
majority of women there must always be a consider 
able number who do not marry, and for the sake o 
these alone it would be well that as rich a life a 
possible should be opened up to women in othe 
directions. But for the sake also of those who d 
marry, and indeed, of the whole community, it mus 
be right that when a girl decides to accept an offer o 
marriage she should not do so simply because she see 
no other escape from a life of intolerable boredom, o
-P-A-G-E-295
HAP. XII THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 289 
yecause “ old maids” are looked down upon, or because 
she has no means of earning an independent living. 
[t does not follow that her disinclination to marriage 
s any greater than in the days when she did these 
shings, but merely that she is no longer driven to it 
n face of disinclination. And it matters compara- 
ively little if the number of marriages is fewer if those 
which are entered upon are better assorted and more 
sapable of a strong family life. 
But does not this education also unfit the girls 
who do marry for the “ womanly” duties which are 
ssential to the welfare of the Family? One is 
empted to answer with Sydney Smith’s question : 
‘Can anything be more absurd than to suppose that 
he perpetual solicitude a mother feels towards her 
hildren can depend upon her ignorance of Greek and 
athematics, or that she would desert an infant for a 
uadratic equation ?” 
Of course a woman will constantly be driven to 
oose between pursuing her intellectual studies and 
tending to Family claims from sheer want of time 
carry on both; but in nine cases out of ten her 
oice will fall upon home and children, and both she 
d they will reap the full advantage of a trained 
d disciplined intelligence to guide her affection. 
n American writer, with a more intimate and 
derstanding knowledge of the situation than could 
attained by a foreigner, writes: “It is true of 
merica, as it is not true of any other nation of the 
orld, that any pursuit which a woman shows herself 
sirous and capable of following, she is free to

follow. And American women have proven them 
selves very able in very many directions, but i 
small towns—and three-fifths, at least, of the wome: 
of America are in small towns—it is in the making « 
homes that they are most able, that they do thei 
part best. They make their homes, as artists mak 
great pictures, not so much because they will a 
because they must. Like great artists, they give t 
the making themselves; and out of their renuncia 
tion, out of their travail, and out of their joy ar 
builded up and welded together these households 
simple, happy, and good, which are our greates 
national strength, as well as our most typical nationa 
achievement. Whatever America may be in th 
future, it is to-day a nation of small communities 
and these communities are merely groups of home 
made by American women. 
If this is still true in America, notwithstandin 
the counter-attractions of life in boarding-houses an| 
hotels of which we hear so much, it is even more tr 
of England. Amongst the great middle classes t! 
home, presided over and managed in every detail 1 
married women, is practically universal. And ju 
in proportion as the education of the women 
better, wider, more thorough, the homes lose t 
aspect of narrowness and self-absorption and co 
ventionality which has been too apt to characteri 
them in the past, and become fitting nurseries for 
nobler generation to follow. Perhaps the fundamentj 
change may be described like this: in a home wh

  CHAP. XII THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 291 
the mother takes an active part or intelligent 
interest in the wider life of the community, the 
children will from the first hear matters of public 
interest mentioned and discussed from a disinterested 
point of view and with reference to the common 
welfare. The whole growth and bent of their minds 
will thus be influenced towards themselves exercising 
1 deliberate and disinterested judgment when they 
themselves are called upon to meet political or social 
problems. But in homes where woman’s interests 
ure narrowed and her judgment untrained, they will 
never hear of outside matters except when their 
father dogmatises or their mother complains that the 
spread of education is making the servants useless, 
And so they too learn to dogmatise and to measure 
ull social and political movements by their own 
oersonal convenience. ‘The first and essential step 
sowards an enlightened democracy, a people able 
o rule the nation wisely, and to find their own 
mterests in the common welfare, is a generation of 
omen fit to be the mothers of such a people, and to 
ake the homes in which wisdom and self-control 
ay be the ruling spirits. 
How far can we apply the same thoughts to the 
osition of women in working-class Families? To 
large extent the woman who is not in a position 
o employ servants, and has the actual work of house 
nd children to do, is saved from the dangers to 
ealth and temper which lie in wait for the woman 
f leisure. Moreover, their early contact with the 
ealities and responsibilities of life has developed in
-P-A-G-E-298
292 THE FAMILY PART I 
them a natural shrewdness and power of judgmen 
which is in many respects of a higher quality thai 
that produced by education. But there can be n 
doubt that a higher standard of education for women 
and a wider habit of taking an interest in outsid 
affairs, would do more than anything to increase th 
happiness and efliciency of many a working-clas 
home. ‘“. . . Labourers’ wives are often greatly thei 
husband’s superiors in general education. . . 
Superiority of education on the part of the wife neve 
causes any alienation; the man shows no jealousy 
the woman no conceit. . .. When, on the othe 
hand, this superiority falls to the man, in addition t 
his greater knowledge of the outside world, as occur 
in the case of highly skilled artisans, non-commissione 
officers in both services, the men who rise in th 
police force, etc., great estrangement results... . / 
woman can share her advantages with a man, and | 
curious gentleness and refinement is often foun 
among labourers who ‘occupy the seat of the un 
learned.’ Every woman is a possible mother, anc 
therefore to some extent a born teacher, but a mai 
can impart little to his wife. The whole unhappines 
of the private lives of ‘risen’ men lies in the inferio 
education of the women they have married.” * 
But the difference made by education comes ou 
most strikingly in the effects upon the home life 
the different occupations followed by the girls befor 
marriage. In some respects service in a well-manage 
but not wealthy Family is the best possible preparatio: 
1 Loane, The Queen’s Poor, pp. 15, 16. 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
  CHAP. XII THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 293 
for family life. A girl who has taken part under 
skilled direction in the work of keeping a home clean 
and healthy, and a Family of children well trained and 
well fed, will be able to apply her experience to her 
own home and her own Family when the time comes. 
In wealthy Families where large numbers of servants 
are kept the lessons she learns are too often those of 
waste and self-indulgence, and attention to appearance 
rather than essentials. Then she will marry the foot- 
man or the butler, and they will keep a public-house 
or a lodging-house, and will not belong to the 
working class at all. 
Domestic service is still the largest industry for 
women, but there are of course many others; and it 
is most noticeable that those girls who are engaged 
in skilled industries, earning fairly good wages, are 
better fitted for their home duties afterwards than 
the girls engaged in rough and unskilled work. 
Partly, no doubt, it is due to the fact that they are 
likely to have come from better homes themselves ; 
but just in proportion as their work calls for more 
intelligence, skill, and patience, and is carried on 
under better discipline and conditions, it is also a 
better preparation for the skilled and difficult work 
of managing a home. 
Tt is noticeable also, and this is a point of utmost 
importance, that the girls who work at skilled 
trades under fair conditions are far more careful in 
the choice of a husband—and it must be remembered 
that this is the choice of a father for their children— 
than the girls who earn low wages at unskilled work.   
 
-P-A-G-E-300
    294 THE FAMILY PART II 
It is sometimes said that to train a girl to earn high 
wages will only mean that she will have to support 
her husband. Experience shows, on the contrary, that 
it is the rougher and less skilled girls who marry the 
loafers who will afterwards live on their wives’ meagre 
earnings; while the girl who has learned to respect 
herself as a capable wage-earner will marry a man 
who knows that his wife’s first duties lie in the 
home. 
The most striking exception to this general rule 
is to be found in some of the textile districts, where 
men and women have for so long worked side by side 
as wage-earners, that they have failed to grasp the 
importance of a redistribution of functions when 
the wife takes upon herself the additional duties of a 
mother and housewife. The results of the failure are 
disastrous from the point’of view of the Family, and 
nothing could so well emphasise the importance of 
the woman in the Family as the miserable condition 
of home and children when she is not in the Family 
but in the mill. Fortunately it is a lesson which the 
working man himself is apt to learn, and the diminish- 
ing proportion of married women who are also wage- 
earners is an indication of a movement towards a 
better division of labour.. It need not mean, of course, 
that women will cease altogether to be wage-earners, 
but only that they will cease to be so during the years 
when a young Family is dependent upon their care. 
There is another point of view from which it has 
been contended that the modern education of women 
works through the family for evil upon the human 
   
-P-A-G-E-301
CHAP. XII THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 295 
race as a whole. The biologist argues that the race 
is strong in proportion as male and female differ in 
their qualities ; and he is supported by the sociologist, 
who maintains that in the course of human evolution 
every forward step sees a greater differentiation 
between the functions of man and woman. One of 
Riehl’s arguments in favour of emphasising the differ- 
ence between the occupations of men and women is 
that the further back you get in the development of 
culture the less marked you find that difference to be. 
He points out that amongst the least cultivated 
peasants, men and women share the same work, and 
are but slightly differentiated even in dress and 
appearance; it would even seem, he says, as if the 
curse of the Old Testament were removed from 
women of this class, who suffer hardly at all from the 
pains of childbirth. One would have thought that 
this undoubted fact would have made him pause in 
his argument, and suspect something amiss in a form 
of progress which involves an increasing curse upon 
half the human race ; but the inveterate belief of the 
average man that it is more womanly to suffer than 
to act, is too strong for him, and we are left with 
the uncomfortable proposition that as greater 
womanliness involves greater suffering, and more 
progress involves more womanliness, so more progress 
involves greater suffering. 
We may find this fact of the comparative immunity 
of the women whose occupations approximate to those 
of men illustrated amongst the costermongers and 
others of their way of living. It depends, of course,
-P-A-G-E-302
  296 THE FAMILY PART II 
upon the occupation being in itself a healthy one, 
and preferably in the open air; but given those 
conditions it seems a mistake to suppose that work, 
even hard work, is detrimental either to mothers or 
their infants. A friend who has lived amongst these 
people for twenty years writes that as her husband 
“ completed his 5000 confinement cases last Christ- 
mas, I asked him what he thought of women working 
up to the end of their ‘time,’ and he said that he 
would unhesitatingly say that the woman who worked 
up to the last had a better time than the woman who 
rested, as in the case of the worker all the muscles of 
the body were in good sound condition, so that a 
quick and easy labour ensued. . . . With regard to 
working whilst the infant is at the breast, if the 
work be done at home it does not appear to be 
detrimental to the mother’s health, . . . but if work- 
ing after childbirth means weaning the infant and 
bringing it up by hand, then the evil to both child 
and mother is very considerable.” 
From the point of view of the Family, and more 
especially the children, it seems thus beside the mark 
to insist either that women shall do no work, or that 
their work shall be different in kind from that of the 
men. Work in itself is beneficial if it is under 
healthy conditions, no matter whether it is what is 
ordinarily called “ womanly” or not, and if it does 
not involve the separation of the mother from her 
young children. 
It is probable that much more conscious experience 
and study of the facts is required before we can
-P-A-G-E-303
CHAP, XII THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 297 
arrive at any really scientific conclusion as to the 
effects of the present development of women’s 
education upon future generations. I for one 
find it impossible to believe that any movement of 
differentiation between men and women which in- 
volves either a stunted mental life or greater physical 
suffering for the mothers of the race can really be in 
the right line of progress. If more differentiation is 
necessary, then we must seek it in some new form, 
and not, as hitherto, in arbitrarily narrowing the scope 
of women’s activities. But if what is required is 
merely a large amount of difference between the two 
parents of a child, it would seem that this is far more * 
effectually secured by the natural law which attracts 
people of unlike dispositions and physical charac- 
teristics together, than by any artificial attempts to 
sunder the human race into two dissimilar groups, 
unlike in such a way as to resemble different species 
rather than the two sexes of the same species. And 
as we have already seen, a strong family life seems the 
most potent and natural means for producing and 
preserving strongly marked differences of character 
and disposition within a people. 
Meanwhile, as usual, facts are rushing ahead of 
theories, and all we can do is to attempt to interpret 
them, and to understand them so far as to be able to 
conform to them wisely. If my reading of the 
present position of woman in the most representative 
Families is right, then it is both stronger and more 
devoted than ever it has been before, just because 
she is able to bring to it the physical and moral
-P-A-G-E-304
298 THE FAMILY PART II 
strength which she has gained from contact with the 
real world. And as this type becomes universal we 
shall see all questions of rivalry between men and 
women become antiquated and disappear, and personal 
self-seeking and aggressiveness be lost in their mutual 
helpfulness towards a common end. 
What is that common end? Primarily, of course, 
it is the Family; but ultimately it can be nothing 
less than the welfare of the community of which the 
Family itself forms a constituent part. And it is 
just here that we may look, I think, for the solution 
of the age-long rivalry between the Family and the 
State. That the Family should exercise a narrowing 
and selfish influence over its members is inevitable so 
long as one of the partners responsible for it is 
excluded from intelligent participation in the work 
of the State, and sees in public services only rival 
claims to those of the Family. Get rid of that 
narrowing and selfish influence and the Family will 
become to an extent never known before the source 
and inspiration of noble and enlightened service to 
the State. And, on the other hand, in proportion 
as this is true, the State will recognise the infinite 
importance of the Family and cease from those 
insidious attacks upon it which arise mainly from 
ignorance of its true function.

Tue prodigality of babydom when we stumble over 
it swarming ‘in the streets, or inspect its ordered 
myriads in the elementary schools, or study its 
advancing tides translated into statistics, is a thing 
to baffle the imagination and the heart. Babies by 
the thousand! by the hundred thousand! How is 
it possible even to think of them with equanimity. 
A baby, as we know it, is a thing which in its waking 
hours at least makes the most exorbitant claims upon 
the attention and watchfulness of those who are 
responsible for its welfare ; it is essentially a unit, 
number one, in whatever company it may find itself; 
299 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
300 THE FAMILY PART II 
and to think of it in hundreds and thousands seems 
a contradiction in terms. And rightly considered it 
is a contradiction in terms. Babies have no corporate 
existence ; there is no proper purpose for which they 
can be removed from their seclusion in the life of the 
Family ; and it is only by an effort of abstraction 
that we can think of them as massed together and 
away from their natural setting. 
It is, of course, a perfectly legitimate application 
of statistics to count the babies, so long as we 
remember that it 7s an abstraction, and do not allow 
ourselves to be seized with panic at our totals. “All 
these babies to provide for,” the alarmists cry; “all 
to be fed and clothed and nursed and tended; and 
then to compete with us in our work and professions.” 
And they forget that in real life they come one by 
one, and that they come only when there are 
two adult people who have been expecting them for 
months and have made themselves responsible for 
their entertainment. Babies are born into Families, 
to be born again after prolonged nurture into citizen- 
ship, and it is only when we leave the Family out of 
our reckoning that the problem of handling them 
presents serious difficulties. 
So far as the baby is concerned, its position in the 
Family can never have been materially different from 
what it is now, and it is difficult to see how it can 
change much in the future. In one important respect 
it has certainly improved amongst civilised races, in 
so far as infanticide is no longer a recognised mode of 
regulating the population, In another respect it  
-P-A-G-E-307
cHap. xr THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 301 
would seem to have deteriorated, in so far as con- 
siderable numbers are deprived of their natural food, 
and have to make shift with quasi-scientific sub- 
stitutes. Otherwise its position remains essentially 
unaltered, for whether it is born of wealthy or of 
poor parents, and in whatever conditions and sur- 
roundings, it continues to be the one absolutely 
dependent member of the Family, and it continues 
also to rule by virtue of its helplessness. 
Why exactly this helplessness should endow the 
baby with such power it is not easy to explain. Itis 
not a quality which appeals to most of us when mani- 
fested in the adult, or even in children of a riper age. 
Perhaps it is because we know that in the baby the 
appeal is wholly unconscious, that there is no arriére 
| pensée in it, no premeditated assault upon our sym- 
pathies, that we are so ready to yield to it. We feel 
in a much deeper way, as we do when we approach a 
nest of fledglings and all the yellow beaks gape wide. 
The open mouth is irresistible, when it is a simple 
expression of need with no suspicion about it of 
design. Our resentment against the older people, 
capable of filling their own mouths, who pursue the 
same method of evoking our sympathies, is a measure 
of our readiness to respond to the genuine appeal. 
There is no question of the baby’s needs being assumed; 
they are obvious and inevitable, and amongst ordinary 
human beings the obvious and inevitable must always 
prevail. 
And so the baby, for the time being, and until the 
next baby comes, occupies a unique position in the
-P-A-G-E-308
302 THE FAMILY PART II 
household. Then he is dethroned, and takes his place 
amongst the rank and file of the other ex-babies. If, 
indeed, he happens to be an “eldest son” he may 
preserve another kind of prerogative, but that is 
incidental to a peculiar type of Family. 
But so long as he remains within the Family the 
child never entirely loses the uniqueness which 
attached to him as a baby; he is never just one 
amongst the others as he is at school for the purposes 
of the teacher, or in still later life as he is one 
amongst the others for the purposes of the census- 
enumerator and tax-collector. The concentration of 
tenderness and attention upon the first few months 
of his helplessness continues, though in a less degree, 
as he becomes gradually more independent of it, and 
to the mother at least he is always “ like his dear self 
alone.” And there can, I think, be no doubt that 
this differentiation by affection within the Family 
group is a most important factor in emphasising and 
developing the individuality of the child. “ Institu- 
tion” children are notably slower to develop than 
children who are brought up with their parents, and 
there is a tendency amongst them for the somewhat 
troublesome qualities of initiative, enterprise and indi- 
viduality to be ruled out by the only less valuable 
qualities which are conformable to discipline and 
routine. It is for this reason that social schemes, 
which would dispense with the Family, and would 
have the child born straight into the State without 
its intermediate shelter, seem foredoomed to failure. 
The State can deal only with classes, not with indi-  
-P-A-G-E-309
cHap. xr THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 303 
viduals, and the child which is not dealt with as an 
individual from the first seems likely never to become 
one in the fullest sense. 
Perhaps one way of bringing out the essential 
features of the relation between the child and the 
Family will be to contrast it with the quite different 
relation between the child and the school. There is 
an increasing tendency to-day to regard the school as 
a substitute for the home, and thus to a large extent 
to stultify the work of both. An eminent writer has 
recently declared that “schools are designed to curb 
and replace the evil influences of home,” and this is 
only an extreme way of stating the prevalent view 
that the school should be responsible, not only for the 
intellectual development of the children, but for their 
morals and manners, their character, also. Another 
writer, an American describing New York, makes the 
statement that the home is passing away, and that in 
future the school must be the world of the child, 
whether working, learning, or playing. And it is 
notable that this view obtains for rich and poor alike; 
among the rich, who tacitly disclaim responsibility 
by sending their children to boarding schools at the 
earliest possible age, and allowing the holidays to be 
a time of complete license, and for the poor, to whom 
the elementary schools are now offering to feed, clothe, 
nurse, and doctor their children, as well as teach 
them. It is worth considering, then, what are the 
essential differences between home and school life 
which may be worth preserving for the sake of the 
child.
-P-A-G-E-310
304 THE FAMILY PART II 
In the first place, I think it is fair to say that, 
generally speaking, the child is valued in the home 
for what he zs, while in the school he is valued in the 
main for what he is to be (I disregard of course his 
grant earning value). In the school the child is being 
prepared for his future life only ; all that he does has 
its meaning with reference to the future. His course 
of instruction, his exercise, his games—all are planned 
for and justified by their effect upon his development. 
His sums, his exercises, his copy-books, the long hours 
of work which he and his master spend together, are 
primarily justified only by the fact that they are 
more or less necessary steps in the creation of a man. 
In a good home this point of view will, of course, 
not be absent, but there the child is valued also for 
what he 2s, sometimes, indeed, too exclusively. We 
all know the fond mother who cannot bear that her 
babies should become boys and girls, and dreads the 
time when her boys and girls will pass into men and 
women. But who can question the incalculable 
benefit to a child, as indeed to all of us, however old, 
of feeling that his mere presence gives pleasure to 
some one, that some one really cares to know all his 
little secrets and fancies and troubles, and that there 
is some one with whom he lives in an equality of 
affection where differences of age and intellect are 
merged? It is this which forms the real link 
between the generations, and makes of child life not 
merely a preparation but something infinitely valu- 
able in itself. 
The next difference I would note is, that the
-P-A-G-E-311
cHAP. x11 THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 305 
relation of the child to the home has in it far more of 
mutual service and reciprocity. than is possible in the 
school. Children are naturally eager to share in the 
occupations and work of their elders, to do the things 
which “ grown up” people do, and in any well-regu- 
lated Family care is taken that this natural impulse 
of the child receives satisfaction and guidance. Little 
duties about the house, little services to other 
members of the Family, are possible from a very early 
age, and contribute far more than any direct teaching 
can do to make the child realise how social life 
depends upon mutual helpfulness. In school the 
relation is inevitably far more one-sided; the whole 
thing exists for the sake of the child, and he is not, 
generally speaking, expected, nor indeed allowed, to     
          
       
   
     
   
   have any share in carrying it on. He must of course 
exert himself if he is to benefit from the teaching, but 
the exertion will obviously be in his own. interests, 
even though the immediate motive may be to please 
the teacher. In short, while home life involves give 
and take, school life is apt to be much take and very 
little give. 
The contrast is deepened by the fact that the rela- 
tion with the Family is, normally, a permanent one, 
ence, though it begins in absolute dependence of the 
hild upon its parents, it gradually develops—at any 
ate amongst the majority of the people—into one of 
utual support and assistance. The child knows 
rom very early years that the time is coming when 
e will be expected to take his share in the responsi- 
ilities of the Family ; later on when he will himself 
Xs
-P-A-G-E-312
306 THE FAMILY PART II 
be responsible for the maintenance of a Family ; and, 
later still, when his parents will look to him for some 
return of the care and support which he received from 
them as a child. But in the school there is no such 
natural development of the relation; the child may 
grow up into the schoolmaster, but only in exceptional 
cases. The relation is necessarily a temporary and, 
for the most part, a one-sided one.* 
Another difference between school and home 
emerges when we consider what are the qualities 
which we desire our children to have when they leave 
the shelter of childhood and come face to face with 
the larger life of the community. 
To speak first quite generally, we want them to 
be at least as well equipped as those who will be 
their future companions, and to some extent their 
competitors; we want them to know as much, and 
to be prepared to take their place amongst the 
without being handicapped through ignorance, an 
for this we look largely to the schools to which wi 
have entrusted them. This is true from the point o: 
view of the nation no less than from the point of vie 
of the individual parents; no nation desires eithe’ 
that there should be an incompetent class withi 
itself, nor that its citizens shall be less competen 
than those of other nations. 
But also we do not wish that our children shoul 
be turned out just like their companions. To ever

alone a true civic life can be based,

parent his own children are unique; they have their 
own characteristics in which he delights—partly, no 
doubt, because he thinks they come from him—and 
he does not want to see these obliterated. I suppose 
no parent, however indifferent, would like to be told 
that his children were just like any one else’s. Now 
the education of family life, as I have already main- 
tained, consists largely in the development—conscious 
and unconscious—of these special characteristics, 
family characteristics, and in turning them to good 
account; a very different matter from either letting 
them run wild or from trying to eliminate them. 
And I would urge again that this is all to the good 
from the point of view of the community also. It is 
only in this way that we can preserve that diversity 
of temperament and ability which adds so much to 
the richness of social life, and provides citizens 
suitable for every kind of function. 
In the school the tendency is an opposite one.. It 
is often said nowadays that the teacher must make a 
special study of every child under his care, and have 
a special scheme of development for each. To some 
extent, no doubt, this must be the case with a 
teacher who is good at his work; different children 
ill respond differently to his teaching, and he must 
ore or less adapt himself to their needs and natures. 
ut if this view is pushed far, there is a danger of 
osing one of the most valuable elements in school 
ife. One of the principal lessons which the child 
as to learn at school is that of conforming to 
niversal laws; to feel that he has to play up to 
       
   
   
         
       
-P-A-G-E-314
308 THE FAMILY | PART I 
what is expected of a boy of his age, to overcome his 
own special difficulties or likings for the sake of 
promoting the work of the class. Now this discipline 
tends to disappear so soon as he has any suspicion 
that the master is playing down to him. I especially 
question the advisability of making lessons too easy, 
of trying to turn work into play; there can hardly 
be any quality we more desire for our children than 
the power to face a difficulty and overcome it, and it 
is a quality we cannot begin too soon to develop. 
But I am given to understand that the theory of 
making lessons easy and entertaining is now driven 
to such extremes that the whole burden of them falls 
upon the teacher, instead of being at least shared by 
the pupil. All difficulties are smoothed away by 
illustrations and explanations and devices of one sort 
and another, until the knowledge to be imparted has 
become like those patent pre-digested breakfast foods 
which America produces. Now, I cannot think that 
the digestion which has its work done for it is likely 
to be strong; and still less can I think that th 
intellect which is catered for in this way is likely t 
prove of much use when face to face with realities| 
An American who is strongly impressed with thi 
mistake of the conscientious teacher writes: “ Thi 
assumption of the entire burden upon themselves 
and the extreme to which the discarding of text 
books is now carried, are among the agencies that ar 
making our city children strangers to thoughtfu 
books, readers at best of nothing but feeble o 
exaggerated fiction. Who can estimate the los
-P-A-G-E-315
  cHaP. xr THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 309 
incurred by a generation growing up without this 
means of companionship with the master-minds of all 
the ages, this resource and consolation in many 
dreary and painful hours. It is equalled only by the 
misfortune to the State, which must accord the duties 
of citizenship to men unable to grasp the real 
meaning of what they read, and naturally more 
likely to hear the talk of fanatics and demagogues 
than of sound thinkers.” 
I should say, then, that for the teacher to take 
upon himself too much of the burden of education is 
to deprive the child of one of the greatest benefits as 
well as pleasures of school-days ; since to have learned 
to overcome a difficulty instead of avoiding it is not 
only an important lesson for future strength and 
happiness, but also the source of one of the purest 
pleasures which life can afford. And it is a discipline 
which is less easy to give in home life, where the 
atmosphere is naturally one of helpfulness. A wise 
parent, it is true, will not respond too readily to 
every childish appeal for help; when no danger of 
permanent injury is involved he will let the children 
work their own way through their little difficulties 
even at the cost of some momentary trouble or 
distress. But the difficulties do not arise naturally 
and progressively in the same way in the home as 
they do at school. 
I have dwelt upon the contrast between home and 
school in order to bring out how each tends to lose in 
its own peculiar efficiency when it attempts to usurp 
the functions of the other. There is one other point 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
  310 THE FAMILY | PART II 
of a somewhat different nature, where the rivalry 
would almost seem to be inevitable, and where 
jealousy of the school has found very strong expres- 
sion. Every generation, I suppose, has its complaint 
to make of the one which is to succeed it, and we 
must not attach too much weight to the grumblings 
of those who see a general falling off since the days 
when they were young. But there is one complaint 
which is almost universal, and which does seem to 
touch a somewhat unlovely characteristic of the 
present day. I refer to the accusation that there is 
among the children a prevailing and increasing want 
of respect towards their elders, more especially, 
perhaps, towards their parents. Nor are the com- 
plainants slow to attribute this tendency to the 
influence of the school, where, they think, the 
children are not taught to order themselves as they 
should towards their elders and betters. 
In considering how far the accusation carries 
weight, we must distinguish between various elements 
in the change which has taken place. In the first 
place, there is no doubt that it is toa large extent 
merely a change of convention, for which the parents 
themselves are as much responsible as any one. 
Children are no longer taught to address their parents 
as Sir or Ma’am, or to observe the formalities proper 
to two or three generations ago. Again, they are 
now encouraged to take part in the conversation and 
interests of their elders instead of observing the old 
maxim of owr nursery days, that children should be 
seen and not heard. Partly this is due to new views
-P-A-G-E-317
cHAP. xr THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 311 
upon education, but partly also to the change we 
have already considered in the basis of the parents’ 
authority in the home. There is nothing inconsistent 
between freedom of intercourse and the loyalty which 
is the essential spirit of the modern Family, and where 
we have the perfect love which casteth out fear, such 
freedom of intercourse is its spontaneous expression. 
So far no failure of real respect is involved. There 
may indeed have been more disrespect concealed 
under the old formalities, more rebellion under the 
old despotic authority than is implied in the 
familiarity of to-day. But to some extent the evil 
complained of is real, and is much to be deprecated 
in the interests of young and old alike ;' and it is also 
true, I think, that it is an evil which the spread of 
education has brought more or less naturally with it. 
I have already suggested the reason. In the old days, 
when the great majority of the people had little 
access to books, still less to schools, the only source 
of knowledge was the accumulated wisdom and 
experience of the older people, of the fathers and 
mothers of the community. When the young folks 
had to turn to them for guidance and information at 
every step, they felt their inferiority and behaved 
accordingly. Now the case is to a large extent 
reversed. At school the children find themselves in 
touch with sources of knowledge which may never 
have been open to their parents. The teacher is a 
mine of information, and if the young people want to 
know anything about past, present, or future, there 
is the whole literature of history and science to take
-P-A-G-E-318
312 | THE FAMILY PART II 
the place of their grandfathers’ recollections. In 
consequence the young are really apt to feel them- 
selves very superior to the old, and this soon reflects 
itself in their bearing. Perhaps it is too much to 
expect that in school the children should be taught 
that book-learning is not the most important kind of 
knowledge. If so, the solution of the difficulty must 
rest with the parents themselves. If mere superiority 
of age will no longer enable them to maintain their 
prestige, then they must seek to excel in other 
‘respects also; we are setting a much higher standard 
for the children, and it will not be a bad thing if it 
reacts by forcing our own standard a little higher. 
There is perhaps too much tendency, as we reach the 
mature age of thirty or forty, to regard ourselves as 
finished products, and to let character and intellect 
lie dormant for the future. When this is so, we 
cannot much wonder if the children, from whom we 
demand such constant efforts to improve themselves, — 
should become critical in their turn. 
And this leads me to another aspect of the 
relation: from the importance of the Family for the 
Child, to the importance of the Child for the Family. 
Of course children are “troublesome,” in the sense 
that they demand constant activity, both of mind 
and body, from those directly responsible for them. 
But activity is life; and it is perhaps not too much 
to say that the majority of mankind are saved from 
mental and physical stagnation by the claims of their 
children. No doubt there are some who think that 
they could have “made a career” if they had not
-P-A-G-E-319
cHap. x1t THE CONSTITUENT PARTS 313 
been weighed down by the burden of a Family and 
the necessity of constant toil; but it is very easy to 
deceive ourselves as to what we might have done 
under different circumstances, and for one man whose 
higher life has been crushed by the needs of his 
Family, a hundred thousand have been stimulated to 
a higher level of industry and efficiency. 
“They must hinder your work very much,” I said 
the other day to a mother busy about the kitchen 
with two-year-old clinging to her skirt. ‘Id never 
get through my work without them,” was the instant 
rejoinder, and in it lay the answer to much of our 
sentimental commiseration of hard-worked mothers. 
It may be hard to carry on the drudgery of daily life 
with the little ones clamouring around; it is ten 
times harder without, for sheer lack of something to 
make it worth while. And how often they act as a 
restraint as well as an incentive perhaps only mothers 
know. “Iam very glad this feeding of the children 
in the school did not come in while mine went to 
school,” remarked one; and when asked for an 
explanation she replied that her husband was rather 
a drinking man, and if he had not had to bring 
something home for the children, of whom he was 
very fond, he would have been far worse than he was. 
One of the most curious misdirections of sympathy 
has been that which dwells upon the monotony of 
the mother’s life. One writer carries this view to the 
extreme by laying down that “home is the girl’s 
prison and the woman’s workhouse.” Now if this 
had been said of the factory or workshop where child
-P-A-G-E-320
  314 THE FAMILY PART IL 
life is excluded, or if it had referred to the woman 
who earns her living in solitude, many would agree. 
But where there are children who are living a natural 
life, monotony is the one evil for which there is 
absolutely no room. No adult human being is 
capable of the infinite variety of the child, and a life 
with children is-essentially a life where it is the 
unexpected which happens. It is when the children 
leave that monotony threatens ; but fortunately in a 
well-ordered Family there is generally a new genera- 
tion arriving before the last one has altogether ceased 
to be “ troublesome.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
CHAPTER XIV 
THE NAME AND THE HOUSE 
THERE are two facts so intimately interwoven with 
the Family as we know it, that it is difficult for us to 
conceive of it as existing apart from them. The one 
is the Name, in which all its members share, and by 
which they are known to the outside world; the 
other is the House or habitation within which its 
members dwell, and in which they find seclusion from 
the outside world. Neither of these can be said to 
be essential in the sense that they actually form 
constituent parts of the family ; yet both contribute 
in a very marked degree to its strength and pre- 
servation, and cannot be altogether omitted from the 
present study. 
To consider first the family Name. Amongst 
members of the same family circle this is rarely if 
ever used; they have no need of a distinguishing 
“mark to tell them who are relations and who are 
merely visitors or friends or servants; and for 
purposes of identification the Christian or forename 
suffices. But in the absence of a strong family 
likeness there is nothing but the name to enable us 
to classify the people we casually see or hear about 
315
-P-A-G-E-322
316 THE FAMILY PART II 
into their respective Families, which means really to 
assign to them a definite and recognisable position in 
the community. It seems probable that originally, 
and amongst some peoples at least, the family name 
would derive a great part of its importance from the 
fact that to certain Families within the State certain 
public duties were assigned ; and for official purposes 
and in order to know who was responsible for those 
duties it was essential that each individual should 
bear the distinguishing mark of his Family. Thus 
amongst the Jews every member of the Family of Levi 
was by birth a priest. In communities where the 
distribution of function by hereditary caste no longer 
survives, the name loses this official significance, and 
a further distinguishing mark which has no reference 
to the family, such as M.P. or L.C.C., has to be added, 
In the higher ranks of “society” the family name 
still bears a sort of quasi-official significance in that 
it enables the expert to determine quickly and easily 
the details arising out of considerations of social 
conventions or precedence. And even in circles 
where the man is taken ‘“‘on his own merits,” the 
family name is an index to far more of those 
“merits” or characteristics than he can show to any 
but his most intimate friends.’ 
It is in our intercourse with the external world, 
between people who have no intimate relations, that 
the need for the family name arises; and in propor- 
tion as the Family is self-contained and powerful as 
1 Just as to the gardener the name ‘‘ Pippin” or ‘‘ Bergamot” suggests 
characteristics common to many varieties of Pippins or Bergamots.
-P-A-G-E-323
CH. XIV THE NAME AND THE HOUSE 317 
against the community we find the family name 
least in evidence, and the forename taking on other 
distinguishing marks. The natural history of naming 
is a study in itself,’ and here we are concerned with 
it only in reference to the Family; but though the 
distinction between the name which belongs to an 
individual as such, and the name which assigns to 
him his place in a Family, is very definite, yet there 
is a frequent transition between the two, forenames 
becoming surnames and surnames forenames; while 
there are certain processes of naming which are con- 
stantly repeating themselves in social history. 
One of the most complicated systems of naming 
was that of the Romans, and as we have taken our 
illustration of the Patriarchal Family from them, so 
also we may take their system of names, though only 
in its most general outline. The normal Roman had 
four names, or rather four kinds of names. First 
there was the name which belongs to the individual 
as such, the name “ with which he is born and with 
which he dies,” the name which his parents choose 
and give to him as his first and most intimate 
possession. How far the choice is an arbitrary one, 
and how far it is determined by family or other 
considerations, we will note presently. This is the 
name to which what we now call the “ Christian” 
name corresponds in general. : 
Then there was the gentile name, which denoted 
to what race or Family in the largest sense the 
individual belonged. This had its origin in various 
1 See Encyclopedia Britannica—article, “‘ Names ” 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
318 THE FAMILY PART II 
ways; it might refer to some remote common 
ancestor, or to the district to which the Family 
belonged, or to the arms which it bore. It corre- 
sponds in general to the name of the Scotch clan, 
perhaps to the name of primitive tribes, and in part 
to our “family name.” But these two by them- 
selves become insufficient to particularise the indi- 
vidual when the clan becomes large, or when the 
choice of individual or forenames is small. Hence a 
third name is necessary to limit still further the 
group to which the individual is assigned; and that 
is done by adding the name of the head of the family 
group in its narrower and stricter sense. Amongst 
the Romans this was the head of the Patriarchal 
Family, which included not only wife and children, 
but slaves and all dependants; and the “ patro- 
nymic” was thus a bond between men of highest 
and of lowest estate. A striking parallel to this 
usage was to be found until lately in modern slave- 
holding communities; but for the most part the 
relation now indicated by it is strictly that between 
parent and child. It is still to be found wherever 
the family community consisting of several genera- 
tions and households persists, notably in Russia. 
What is wanted here for purposes of daily intercourse 
is a name to indicate, not to what Family an indi- 
vidual belongs, but of which brother he is the child; 
thus Peter, son of Paul, would be distinguished from 
Peter, son of Andrew. The usage is common also in 
districts such as Wales, where the variety of family 
names is very small. Here it becomes quite necessary 
   
-P-A-G-E-325
  CH. XIV THE NAME AND THE HOUSE 319 
to distinguish the individual in some other way than 
by the combination of his Christian and family name, 
and though there are other methods, perhaps the 
commonest is by the addition of his father’s or 
mother’s Christian name. How old this device is, is 
shown by the surviving prefixes which signify “the 
son of,” “Fitz” in Norman English, “Mac” in 
Scotch, “Ap” in Welsh (Pritchard = ap Richard, 
Price = ap Rice). 
Finally we find amongst the Romans the cognomen, 
originally like the forename in being strictly peculiar 
to the individual, but unlike it in that it is given 
only after the recipient has passed early childhood, is 
not used within the family circle, and is not re- 
cognised in strictly official documents. In a sense it 
is even more individual than the forename, in that it 
frequently indicates some purely personal peculiarity ; 
later it becomes hereditary, and so loses something of 
this individuality, but in its original use it corre- 
sponds very closely to what we call a “nickname.” 
Here again we find an exact modern parallel in 
districts where family names are ‘few in variety ; 
personal peculiarities or personal occupations are 
frequently used in Wales and other districts in 
addition to the proper name for purposes of identifi- 
cation; and that these tend to become hereditary, 
and so to become family names in our modern sense, 
any list of names in common use would abundantly 
make manifest. In a note to Guy Mannering Scott 
writes: “The distinction of individuals by nicknames 
when they possess no property is still common on the
-P-A-G-E-326
  320 THE FAMILY PART II 
Border, and indeed necessary, from the number of 
persons having the same name. In the small village 
of Lustruther, in Roxburghshire, there dwelt, in the 
memory of man, four inhabitants called Andrew, or 
Dandie, Oliver. They were distinguished as Dandie 
Eassil-gate, Dandie Wassil-gate, Dandie Thumbie, and 
Dandie Dumbie. The two first had their names from 
being eastward and westward in the street of the 
village; the third from something peculiar in the 
conformation of his thumb; the fourth from his 
taciturn habits.” The passage to which this note is 
appended is itself so appropriate to the whole subject 
that I will quote it here: “Ye see, sir,” said an old 
shepherd, rising and speaking very slow, “the folks 
hereabout are a’ Armstrongs and Elliots, and sic like 
—twa or three given names—and so, for distinction’s 
sake, the lairds and farmers have the names of their 
places that they live at—as, for example, ‘Tam 0’ 
Todshaw,’ ‘ Will o’ the Flat,’ ‘Habbie o’ Sorbietrees,’ 
and our good master here, ‘o’ the Charlies-hope.’ 
Aweel, sir, and then the inferior sort o’ people, 
yell observe, are kend by sorts o’ by-names, some 
o them, as Glaiket Christie, and the Deuke’s 
Davie, or may be, like this lad Gabriel, by his 
employment—as, for example, Tod Gabbie, or Hunter 
Gabbie.” 
Under certain circumstances the forename itself, 
though properly speaking strictly individual, may 
come to have a kind of indirect significance. Amongst 
the patrician Romans the choice of a forename for 
their male children was very limited; at one time 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
  CH. XIV THE NAME AND THE HOUSE 321 
only eighteen such names were in use,’ and particular 
Families were limited to a still smaller cycle. More- 
over, these names, in contrast with the usage of the 
family name, were reserved for the use of sons of the 
house in the stricter sense; so that there must have 
been a time when the forename indicated not only 
gentle birth, but also the actual Family to which the 
bearer belonged. That by degrees the plebeians 
should appropriate the patrician names amongst 
other patrician privileges was, as Mommsen points 
out, natural enough; and the process is paralleled in 
our own times by the eagerness with which the 
democracy seek out for their children names which 
used to be considered appropriate for the aristocracy 
alone. 
All vestiges of monopoly in Names have now 
disappeared, but traces still linger amongst us of 
the clinging of a Family to a particular series of 
names. There are probably few Families in which 
some at least of the children are not “called after” 
some previous member of the Family. In other 
countries this is perhaps even more the case than 
with us: “Beim hohen Adel und den echten Bauern 
sucht die Familie selbst ihren kleinen Kreis herkémm- 
lichen Vornamen erblich beizubehalten, und wenn 
alle Prinzen eines Hauses Friedrich Wilhelm und alle 
Jungen einer Bauernsippschaft Hans und Peter 
heissen, so liegt beiden das gleiche Motiv konzen- 
trierten Familienbewusstseins zu Grunde.” * 
1 See Mommsen, Rémische Forschwngen, vol. ii. 
2 Riehl, Die Familie, p. 159.
-P-A-G-E-328
  
  322 THE FAMILY PART II 
But the choice of the forename has often a signific- 
ance even wider than that of the Family or class. 
Our use of the term “Christian name” itself implies 
definite religious ceremonies, though the implication 
is no longer always justified. Riehl points out again 
how the names current at any period reflect the 
social mind or movements of that period. In the 
earlier Middle Ages, he tells us, the German people 
“called their children after the heroes of their own 
“race, and purely German names prevailed. Later, 
under the growing influence of the Roman church, 
the Greek and Latin names from the stories of the 
saints pushed out the old German, and in their turn 
made way in the Reformation time for Biblical names 
from both Old and New Testament. “To-day 
families of the nobility turn again to the medieval 
names of chivalry, the peasant holds fast to the 
traditions of the last few centuries, while in the flat 
and genteel bourgeois world an eclecticism rules 
which amounts to complete confusion. . . . The 
name no longer characterises the personality, the 
family, the rank, the calling. It sinks into a purely 
external sign.” 
It is easy to trace similar influences in other 
countries. The Presbyterian movement in England 
and Scotland introduced a series of Biblical and 
quasi-theological names, many of which sound most’ 
incongruous to modern ears, and it is probable that 
the distinction between aristocratic and plebeian 
names dates from the struggle between Normans and 
Saxons, and was reinforced by the hatred of Cavalier
-P-A-G-E-329
  CH. XIV THE NAME AND THE HOUSE 323 
and Roundhead. Now there is a tendency for the 
aristocrats to seek piquancy in names of rustic 
association, while in other classes the caprice of 
choice reflects every passing incident of the day. A 
popular novelist will be responsible for a generation 
of Guys or Marcellas; and a popular preacher or 
statesman or poet scatters namesakes all over the 
land. And if there were any chance of forgetting 
the date of the South African campaign the historian 
would only need to consult the ages of the un- 
fortunate children whose names record its victories. 
The true family name is far less subject to 
caprice and fashion in that it is with few exceptions 
ereditary. Hence it reflects or commemorates not 
assing events or moods in the external world, but 
omething in the history or circumstances or nature 
f the Family itself when it first became recognised 
s an independent self-contained group. And it is 
interesting in this connection to note how frequently 
he word chosen to designate the Family is the word 
hich represents either the place from which the 
‘amily comes, in many cases the family estate, or the 
ccupation in which the Family was engaged. These, 
s we have seen, have always been two of the most 
owerful factors in preserving the unity of the 
‘amily ; and they perfect their work in this direction 
hen they also give the name which is to be both 
he outward sign of the Family and an additional 
ond between its members. 
For in proportion as the family community be- 
fame dispersed the family Name would become
-P-A-G-E-330
    324 THE FAMILY PART II 
important, not only as a means of identification to 
outsiders, but also as a tie to hold the scattered 
members of the Family together; in the absence o 
a common designation it would be next to impossible| 
for a widespread cousinhood even to know, much| 
less to maintain communication with, its various 
members. For purposes of merely individual identi- 
fication the use of a “cognomen” or “nickname” is| 
sufficient; and it would probably be found that in| 
large communities where the use of these to th 
exclusion of the family Name is common (as wheneve 
large numbers of labourers associate together), ther 
all family ties but the very closest are quickly los 
sight of. 
\ 
THe House 
It may be doubted whether the House wa 
primarily a protection against the weather or agains 
the intrusion of “other people.” It certainly serve 
both functions, more or less imperfectly ; and whic 
is the predominant motive at any time or plac 
probably depends upon the climate. But it i 
significant that popular usage does not dignify b 
the name of House the mere “shelter” which is ope 
to all comers, though it keeps out the weather. Lik 
the Name, the House serves both to hold the member: 
of the Family together and to guard them from con: 
fusion with, or intrusion from, members of othe 
Families, and it does so in an even more marked an 
obvious way in so far as bricks and mortar are mor 
solid and tangible than words.
-P-A-G-E-331
CH. XIV THE NAME AND THE HOUSE 325 
Houses are nowadays built for other purposes than 
the reception of single Families, and for that reason 
it would have been convenient to use the word 
Home to represent the House or part of a house 
which serves to shelter more or less permanently 
the single Family with its dependants. But un- 
fortunately the word Home has itself been mis- 
applied to institutions which share few of the 
characteristics of family life, and it will perhaps be 
less misleading to adhere to the word House, defining 
it to mean any shelter from the weather which is 
reserved for the use of a particular Family. 
It is an essential feature of the House in this 
sense that it can be closed against outsiders. If it is 
nothing more than a gipsy’s van, or the shelter of 
cave or tree, so long as its limits are respected by the 
rest of the community, the privacy and consecutive- 
mess of family life.can be preserved, and no longer. 
And this power of exclusion is not of merely negative 
value, exercised against the outsider ; it gives rise to 
the whole range of virtues and rights and duties 
which gather around the conceptions of hospitality 
and guest and host. To hold the balance true 
between the duties of the house towards the outside 
world, in the exercise of hospitality, and the duties 
of the house towards the Family in preserving its 
privacy, is no small part in the problem of its 
management; the family life may as easily become 
swamped in a multiplicity of guests, as it may 
become selfish in its exclusiveness. 
The size of the House is not an essential feature ;
-P-A-G-E-332
326 THE FAMILY PART II 
  the definite space which is held sacred to the family 
life may be a palace, or it may be a single room, and 
in so far as a palace is more liable to intrusion it is 
always possible that the single room may be more of 
a home. But neither of these extremes represents 
the typical family House which is built with reference 
to the needs of a Family. 
Riehl points out how domestic architecture has 
changed in proportion as the conception and organisa- 
tion of the Family itself has changed. His own 
theory of the House is that it should be designed to 
hold three or four Families with their common 
ancestor and their dependants; a conception corre- 
sponding rather to the needs of the patriarchal than 
of the modern Family. There are two tendencies in 
particular which he notices and deprecates. The one 
is the tendency to abandon the large “ living-room,” 
where the whole Family lived together by day, carry- 
ing on their various occupations, and to substitute 
a series of smaller rooms for the use of particular 
members—one room for the man, another for his 
wife, another for the children. In quite modern 
houses we may notice a reaction in favour of the 
family room, but it is probably incompatible with the 
development of intellectual work, such as that of the 
student or artist or musician. 
The other tendency which Riehl deprecates is the 
modern way of building “from without in,” instead 
of “from within out,” that is, of building the house to 
suit the street, instead of to suit the needs of the 
Family. More especially he laments the disappear-
-P-A-G-E-333
  CH. XIV THE NAME AND THE HOUSE 327 
ance from German houses of the “ Erker,” or over- 
hanging oriel windows, for the “ Erker” was the 
corner assigned to the unmarried relative of the 
household, who there lived as one of the Family, and 
yet, to some extent, apart from it. But the “ Erker” 
spoiled the line of the street, police regulations 
abolished it, and the elderly relative has lost her 
corner in the family house. In the same way, he 
thinks, “in Society and in the Family also we build 
symmetrically and mechanically from without in- 
wards, instead of organically from within outwards.” * 
It was in keeping with this change that the fashion 
grew up of numbering the houses. “The organic 
house had a name, the symmetrical house has only a 
number.” And where symmetry has reached its 
fullest development even the streets lose their names 
and are identified by numbers or letters of the 
alphabet. 
It is not, of course, purely want of imagination 
which has led to the substitution of numbers for names ; 
in towns it is a distinct convenience to have a system 
of numbering both streets and houses which will 
ensure them being easily found. On the other hand, 
it is not impossible to devise a system of naming 
which should indicate the locality, and yet be more 
interesting and more easily remembered than bare 
numbers. There is a small district in one of the 
dullest, poorest parts of London where the names of 
the streets suggest that the vestrymen responsible for 
them must just have returned from their summer

holidays. Cambridge Street, York Street, Boston 
Street, Weymouth Street, Tuilerie Street, serve at 
least to bring pleasant associations into a somewhat 
dreary region; but it is when we find Shap Street, 
Scawfell Street, and Appleby Street in close proxi- 
mity that we realise what use might be made of a 
geographical or, possibly, even an historical scheme of 
naming. 
The possibility of recovering names for houses in 
the town seems very remote; yet every one who can 
make his house significant enough to carry a name will 
do so. The speculative builder of the suburbs knows 
his business when he labels each little dwelling-place 
as Ivy Villa, or Laburnum House, or The Gables; 
there is at least the suggestion of something dis- 
tinctive, some quality sufficiently marked to give rise 
toaname. It is a feeling analogous to that attach- 
ing to the names of human beings; were it not for 
the greater mobility of men as compared with houses 
there would be nothing impossible in substituting a 
system of numbers and letters for our present system 
of names. But when it is done, as in prisons, we feel 
that the people numbered have suffered a serious loss 
of individuality, almost of humanity. And in a 
lesser degree we feel that our houses suffer a loss 
when they are known merely as one in a numerical 
series. 
One of the most marked differences between town 
and country is, that in the town the house is ceasing 
to represent externally the needs and character of 
the Family inhabiting it. It is not the case, as is so 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
  CH. XIV THE NAME AND THE HOUSE 329 
often assumed by writers on town life, that monoton- 
ous, dreary streets necessarily represent monotonous, 
dreary lives; what they really represent are three 
factors entirely independent of family life: scarcity 
of land, building bye-laws, and speculative builders. 
In the country these factors are less universal, though, 
as a matter of fact, even in the country comparatively 
few houses are built to suit the needs of the actual 
Families occupying them. But in the country there 
is generally some room for the Family to express 
itself externally, either by actual addition or orna- 
mentation to the house itself, or at any rate in the 
garden, which is a continuation of the house. Even 
in the town, in the poorest and dullest streets, this 
power is not entirely absent, small decorations adorn 
many of the houses, such as window boxes, ingeniously 
contrived to look like miniature garden palings. 
And inside the house, however small, the Family still 
finds room to express itself in furniture and arrange- 
ments. It is significant in this respect that amongst 
town-dwellers the “home” means not the actual 
house, but the furniture which bears the impress of 
their use and needs and aspirations. Hence the com- 
parative readiness with which they move from one 
house to another—they take their home with them ; 
while the country Family in moving leaves a large 
part of its home in the house and garden upon which 
it has impressed its own personality. But to say 
that the houses in a street are all alike because they 
all have the same number of doors and windows in 
the same places, and are of approximately the same
-P-A-G-E-336
  330 THE FAMILY PART II 
colour, is much like saying that human beings are all 
alike because they all have the same number of limbs 
and features in the same places, and are of approxi- 
mately the same colour. It is within that we must 
look for characteristic differences. And when we 
look within we find that in every house which is 
sufficiently inhabited, whether by rich or poor, the 
Family leaves its characteristic mark upon every 
detail of adornment and furniture, even the furniture 
which is turned out by the hundred thousand. I 
remember one extreme case in which every small 
article in a room had been gilded all over, with an 
effect dazzling to the outsider, but no doubt eminently 
satisfactory and expressive to the owner. 
Though the, monotonous line of the streets does 
not represent the lives of the Families inhabiting 
them, no doubt it reacts upon them indirectly by 
curtailing their field of self-expression in one important 
direction. How deeply inherent this need is in 
human nature may be seen in the eagerness with 
which all sorts and conditions of town-dwellers will 
grasp at any piece of land, however minute, which 
they can transform into a garden. It is a wonderful 
sight to watch the construction of a row of small 
suburban houses, each with its small plot in front 
and small strip behind. The builder leaves them 
hard and dusty and full of brickbats, a dreary 
spectacle. In six months, if the seasons are favour- 
able, they are blossoming with every colour of the 
rainbow, and each presents its characteristic differ- 
ence. Qne aspires to roses, another is content with

sunflowers; the scarlet of the Virginian creeper com- 
petes with the purple and white of the clematis next 
door; the utilitarian cherishes scarlet runners and 
strawberries, while the father of small children has a 
tiny lawn for the babies to roll upon. And just here 
and there the weeds are left to run riot and bear 
witness to another type of Family. 
I must raise again here, though briefly, a question 
which I have discussed before,’ and on which my view 
has been called in question. This is not the place in 
which to discuss the Housing problem, but it is rele- 
vant to ask: Is it possible for family life to be carried 
on in the overcrowded condition of our large towns ? 
My answer remains that it is not only possible, but 
that it is constantly and successfully done. That 
there are difficulties peculiar to town life I fully agree, 
but not primarily because the houses are small, or 
because Families are confined to one or two rooms. 
That is not a condition peculiar to town alone; there 
are country dwellings in every land where the Families 
are just as cramped for room as in the town; indeed, 
one important cause of the migration which is taking 
place into the towns is just that the young people 
find no house-room to start new Families in the 
country. And whereas in the town there is always 
the possibility of taking another room as the children 
begin to earn, in the country there may be no such 
possibility, and then they may be really forced to leave 
the Family. That even this does not necessarily mean 
1 In The Strength of the People.
-P-A-G-E-338
  332 THE FAMILY PART II 
  its breaking up, every Family knows which has sent 
its sons and daughters out into the world without 
losing its hold upon their affections. We must look 
for other reasons than mere scarcity of house-room for 
weakness of family life, which is apt to show itself in 
crowded districts. 
There are several directions at the present day in 
which the idea of a house devoted to the sole use of 
one Family seems to have been abandoned. The 
hotel and the boarding-house, the common lodging- 
house, the workhouse, the prison, the sisterhood, the 
asylum, the school, the settlement—all these stand on 
the same footing in that their inhabitants have more 
or less permanently preferred, or have had assigned to 
them, the life of another community than that of the 
Family, and have chosen their dwelling accordingly. 
With many it is a matter of quite temporary con- 
venience, a mere interlude for business or holiday, in 
the normal family life. Of those who have chosen it 
as a permanent form of life in preference to the 
privacy of the family house, the majority are en- 
deavouring to lessen the responsibilities of life by 
cutting out the burden of “housekeeping.” So far 
the motives which actuate the habitués of hotels and 
boarding-houses seem to be much the same as those 
by which men and women of less wealth are moved 
to descend to lodging-houses and shelters and work- 
houses, rather than make the exertion of keeping up 
a home of their own. The greater facility of life on 
this level is undoubted ; but it is one of the instances
-P-A-G-E-339
  CH. XIV THE NAME AND THE HOUSE 333 
in which greater facility seems to be loss rather than 
gain. We hear much of the spread of boarding-house 
and hotel life, both here and in America, but in order 
to estimate the real strength of the movement we 
ought to know also how many of those who enter 
upon it weary of it after a few years, and are glad to 
resume the greater richness of home life with all its 
difficulties. 
Perhaps one of the most interesting revivals in art 
which awaits us, which indeed is already manifesting 
itself, is that of domestic architecture. No doubt the 
prevailing idea of a dwelling-place in the builder's 
mind is still that of a square box divided into com- 
partments; but there are few parts of the country 
where we may not see signs that we are once more 
awakening to the idea that a house may be beautiful 
as well as useful. And this is true not only of the 
houses of the few, but, what is far more important, of 
the homes of the many also. Even the builders of 
suburban villas and country cottages are beginning 
to realise their responsibilities in this matter, and to 
find that houses with a certain amount of character 
and individuality are more attractive. 
Before concluding this chapter I must point out 
again that the Name and the House are alike in the 
double function they perform for the Family. On 
the one hand, they both emphasise its exclusiveness 
and assign its limitations; on the other hand, they 
both serve as instruments by which it transcends its 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
    334 THE FAMILY PART II 
exclusiveness and limitations. The Family which 
opens itself to the admission of a new member 
(whether wife or child or adopted child), does so 
formally by the gift of its most intimate and inalien- 
able possession, its Name; while all to whom the 
shelter of the House is open are in a peculiar sense 
members of the Family so long as they avail them- 
selves of it.
-P-A-G-E-341
CHAPTER XV 
CONCLUSION 
Ir the foregoing sketch of the Family in its history 
and present constitution is even approximately true, 
we are justified in regarding it as an original and 
probably indispensable institution in human society. 
However it may vary in form and strength, no race 
has been found in which it does not exist in some 
form, and no people has advanced far in civilisation 
in which it has not been highly organised and firmly 
knit together. 
But we find that this organisation may be motived 
and sustained in very different ways, at different 
stages of a people’s life, and amongst different peoples. 
We find, for instance, one form of the patriarchal 
Family, perhaps the most rigid and highly organised 
form of all, based upon a religion, upon a system of 
ancestor - worship. Nearer to ourselves we find 
another form, hardly less permanent and rigid, based 
upon a system of landed property, as in agricultural 
communities, or in the feudal Family which elabor- 
ated itself by means of primogeniture into something 
very like that based upon ancestor-worship. And in 
our own day we find the modern Family which has 
335
-P-A-G-E-342
eee ARE he ghee Pe Tat Se oan em eT Tt cet at prere 
: 
| 336 THE FAMILY PART II 
freed itself both from the spiritual tyranny of ancestor- 
worship and the material tyranny of Tanded property, 
but has inherited and preserved the best traditions of 
both. | 
For the modern Family is in no sense a weakened 
or degenerate form. Its strength lies in the fact that 
in it we are attaining on the one hand to a higher 
knowledge of the true spiritual forces which bind the 
generations together, on the other hand to a better 
theory of material prosperity. If the sons of the 
modern Family do not dread the avenging spirits of 
their ancestors, yet they recognise the compelling 
power of the traditions and qualities bequeathed by 
those ancestors, and fear to fall below them. If the 
father of the modern Family has lost or relinquished 
the power which he exercised over wife and children 
as autocrat in an industrial community, or by his 
hold upon the family property, he has found a 
stronger basis for his authority, a firmer hold upon 
their affections, in the loyalty which responds to a 
wise and generous rule. And the recognition of the 
fact that a more unfailing source of material pro- 
sperity lies in personal qualities than in either land 
or money, has enabled the modern Family to maintain 
itself independently of inherited wealth, while it has 
restored the younger brothers to their equality of 
sonship. 
And this development of the modern Family has a 
new significance for the State. As we have seen, 
State and Family have always been intimately con- 
nected in their mutual influence. From time to time
-P-A-G-E-343
  CHAP. XV CONCLUSION 337 
the State has made strenuous efforts to mould the 
Family according to its needs; but ultimately the 
State itself must always be moulded by the Family, 
since it is in the Family that the citizen is made. 
Now the development of the modern Family has 
meant the restoration of the younger brothers, and 
the restoration of the younger brothers means 
Democracy. It means, that is, the absence of all 
privilege but what is conceded by loyalty in the 
interests of the community. But, as we have seen, 
there are two types of younger brothers. There is 
the type of which the true modern Family is con- 
stituted: courageous, enterprising, self-reliant, and 
self-controlled; and these are the strength of the 
nation and the salt of the earth. There is also the 
type which is characteristic of the feudal Family in 
its worst form : timid, selfish, with no higher ambition 
than to find a “soft job” and draw upon the public 
purse; it was these younger brothers who were the 
first to claim the “right to work” on their own 
terms and at the expense of the State. Both notes 
are sounded in our Democracy of to-day, and the 
fortunes of the nation depend upon which prevails. 
It is inevitable that to some of my readers the 
thought will have occurred that there are Families 
known to them which serve no such purpose as those 
which I have tried to indicate, whose influence is for 
evil rather than for good. If this is raised as an 
objection to the function of the Family as here — 
represented, my answer is that however true the 
Zz
-P-A-G-E-344
  338 THE FAMILY | PART II 
contention may be it is irrelevant. To understand 
the purpose and meaning of an organism or institu- 
tion we must take it in its completeness at any stage 
of development, and not in a degraded or mutilated 
form. The best institutions may easily become the 
most mischievous when they are perverted or mis- 
managed, but that does not affect their intrinsic 
value unless it can be shown to be inherent in their 
nature to be perverted or mismanaged. Nevertheless, 
although it is only incidental to the main purpose of 
this study, it will be interesting to touch very briefly 
upon some of the conditions under which the Family 
does seem to break down and to have its real purpose 
perverted. 
Personal defects of character stand, of course, pre- 
eminent as causes militating against family life. 
Self-indulgence of all kinds, whether in drink or 
gambling or any form of greed, make a man difficult 
to live with in any kind of community, and more 
especially when he can exercise direct power over the 
lives of others. On the other hand, no influence is 
so strong to guard against the development of such 
defects as these as the Family itself, when it is 
allowed to have free play. 
Of failure due to wider and more external in- 
fluences we may note the following instances :—In 
the first place, we find the Family failing and per- 
verted whenever the burden of maintaining it is 
transferred to any great extent from the strong 
members to the weak. It was so, for instance, in 
the early days of the factory system, when child
-P-A-G-E-345
  CHAP. XV CONCLUSION 339 
labour was much employed, though it is significant 
that even then it was the children of the Poor Law, 
the children without Families, who were the first and 
principal sufferers. It is so at the present day 
whenever we find the Family mainly dependent upon 
the earnings of women and girls. It seems to be 
almost inevitable that the man who accepts a sub- 
ordinate economic position in the Family degenerates 
into a loafer and tyrant. 
We find the Family weak again and perverted 
wherever there is an extensive reliance upon external 
sources of maintenance. It is as if the man in 
abdicating from his economic independence inflicts an 
injury upon his moral nature which poisons all his 
natural relations. For an illustration on a large scale 
we need only turn to the generation living in the 
early part of the nineteenth century, when under 
the influence of the old Poor Law family life suffered 
a terrible and widespread degeneration. For instances 
on a smaller scale the student may go to any town or 
district—fortunately they are not now very numerous 
—where men are in the habit of looking to external 
aid for maintenance rather than to their own exer- 
tions. There he will find without fail that family 
ties are weak, and that family rights and responsi- 
bilities are perverted into abuses. It is perhaps 
chiefly in the large towns that he will find this cause 
at work, owing partly to the greater number of 
charitable agencies and the greater difficulty of 
carrying on their work wisely, and partly to the 
greater ease of evading responsibilities in the busy 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
  340 THE FAMILY PART II 
and crowded life. And it is to this evasion of the 
responsibility which is the strength of the Family that 
we mainly owe the degenerate family life which is 
characteristic of the worst, not necessarily the poorest, 
parts of our towns. 
But there is, I think, another main reason why 
family life tends to degenerate in large towns. It is 
the habit of facile and superficial intercourse which 
grows up when people are hoarded together in very 
close quarters. Real interests, even outside interests, 
are not necessarily hostile to family life; indeed, 
they usually serve to enrich it unless of such a nature 
as to absorb all time and strength. They form an 
organic union between those who share in them, 
which is itself analogous to the Family; and inter- 
course based upon true interests deepens and sweetens 
the very springs of life. But this is something quite 
different from the intercourse which is based upon no 
common interest, but is the mere outcome of casual 
proximity. (I say casual proximity, because there 
may be an organic proximity, which is another thing 
altogether.) We are taught that we are to love our 
neighbour ; we are also taught that our neighbour is 
not every man who happens to pass us in the street, 
but the man with whom we are able to establish real 
relations of sympathy and helpfulness. No genuine 
attempt can be made to establish these relations with 
all the casual acquaintances of town life, or if made 
it is doomed to failure. The very meaning of neigh- 
bourliness tends to disappear in proportion to the 
density of population and the habit of facile ac-
-P-A-G-E-347
  CHAP. XV CONCLUSION 341 
quaintanceship. Hence the paradox that human 
lives may be more unutterably lonely in the crowds 
of a town than is possible in the smallest village. 
Friendship is a plant which needs sedulous cultiva- 
tion, and, with a practically infinite circle of ac- 
quaintances to draw upon, few people will be at the 
trouble to make friends; at the first breath of 
coolness, the first casual friction, they will turn 
to another, to repeat the process indefinitely. It is 
this habit which is hostile to family life as well as to 
friendship; we cannot live with members of our 
Family on terms of mere acquaintanceship, but mere 
acquaintanceship is much easier, and appears for the 
time at least to give us what we need at much less 
cost to ourselves. 
It is in this way that we tend to get in our large 
towns a number of people, men and women, who 
have let slip their membership of a family group 
without raising themselves to anything higher. They 
have become disconnected atoms drifting through 
the life of the community, bound by no ties of duty 
or responsibility, seeking only the satisfaction of the 
moment, and often becoming incapable even of self- 
maintenance. If the production of a class like this 
were the inevitable outcome of city life, it would seem 
to be another proof, or at least another suggestion, that 
man is not naturally a gregarious animal, except to a 
very limited extent, and that he cannot become so in 
a high degree without deterioration to a level which is 
scarcely human. Fortunately such phases as we have 
been considering have so far proved to be temporary. 
   
-P-A-G-E-348
  342 THE FAMILY PART II 
Always the Family has reasserted itself, at latest 
in the next generation, and always it has proved 
itself the means of restored independence and 
prosperity. 
It has been impossible for me, with very limited 
resources of knowledge and experience to draw upon, 
to do more than suggest in its crudest outlines what 
the history of the Family has been in the past. It is 
a great work waiting for a great scholar. It has been 
perhaps still more impossible to show with any hope 
of adequacy what the Family is at any time, more 
especially at the present time, for the people who 
live beneath its sway. It may be that it is a theme 
fitter for the poet than for sober prose; for there 
is hardly a subject which poets have made peculiarly 
their own which does not find a place within the 
Family. It is greater than love itself, for it includes, 
ennobles, makes permanent all that is best in love. 
The pain of life is hallowed by it, the drudgery 
sweetened, its pleasures consecrated. It is the great 
trysting-place of the generations, where past and 
future flash into the reality of the present. It is the 
great storehouse in which the hardly earned treasures 
of the past, the inheritance of spirit and character 
from our ancestors, are guarded and preserved for 
our descendants. And it is the great discipline 
through which each generation learns anew the 
lesson of citizenship that no man can live for 
himself alone. 
But when in writing of the Family one is baffled
-P-A-G-E-349
  CHAP. XV CONCLUSION 343 
by the magnitude of the theme, then the thought 
comes to one’s aid that inadequacy need not mean 
failure. For, like all the greatest things in life, it lies 
open to all; it is a book where he who runs may read, 
and every one may supply from his own knowledge 
and experience what he misses in the picture offered 
to him. But it is one of the sad truisms of daily life 
that our eyes are wont to overlook the things which 
lie nearest to us, and some service may be done 
by one who can recall our wandering attention, 
however imperfectly, and if only by saying, “look 
there!” 
There is danger, no doubt, lest an inadequate 
attempt to bring into fuller consciousness the reality 
and importance of so intimate a part of our lives 
should tend to make it appear commonplace. Against 
that must be set the very real risk that in our wncon- 
sciousness we may heedlessly endanger its very 
existence, or at least neglect to guard it as jealously 
as we might. If we are to prefer other institutions 
to it, to seek other methods of ordering our lives, 
it should at least be with the full realisation of 
what it is we are prepared to sacrifice. To some 
who watch the social movements and legislation of 
to-day, it seems that this choice is being made without 
a full and conscious deliberation, and that we are 
thus in danger of bartering the substance for the 
shadow. 
Tt is clear, then, that this book has had nothing 
new to offer. It only calls attention to a great fact  
-P-A-G-E-350
    344 THE FAMILY PART IL 
which lies within the experience of every one, and 
attempts—how roughly and imperfectly no one 
knows better than the writer—to suggest what its 
significance is and has been in the great drama of 
humanity.

PREFACE 
Tuus book contains a brief discussion of a few of the vital 
problems that arise in schools and school systems. It does 
not claim to be a philosophy of school management, yet it 
endeavors to show the relations of these problems, as to both 
their sources and their solutions, to that comprehensive view 
of life which we call philosophy. 
Its treatment is based upon the creed that life is one, 
especially that the single human life is simple in the midst 
of its complexity, that its thread is continuous and easily 
traced. No portion of it can justly be treated apart from 
the whole. The principles that determine its character at 
one time determine it at all times. Hence school life is to be 
judged and its office regulated not as apart from the wider 
life but as a part of it. During the school period and the 
subsequent period the laws of growth, which is education, 
are the same. There are no fundamental differences in 
principle. The differences are merely those of condition 
and environment. 
In directing the life of the school, we need not to seek for 
new bases of conduct or new stimuli to activity, but merely 
to apply to the necessary conditions of the school those uni- 
versal laws of life and growth that may be known and read 
of all men. 
Much of the wastefulness of school life is due to attempts 
to do something extraordinary and unlike what is done in 
T
-P-A-G-E-6
  vi Preface 
the other affairs of life, to create a peculiar institution founded 
upon some mysterious peculiar principle. Hence our work 
has been so largely artificial and correspondingly futile. 
It is life that educates, life in its totality, and school 
offers a life to the pupil. The character of this life deter- 
mines the education. 
Hence the aim of school should be to place the children 
in the midst of a natural, sane, and wholesome life, free from 
all false, ephemeral, and artificial standards and stimuli. 
To show how this may be done in a few of the many pos- 
sible instances is the aim of this book. It is hoped that it 
may at least stimulate thought, and suggest to some teachers 
and school officers, burdened with the responsibility of their 
work, a practical solution of some of their problems. 
The foundations for this book were laid in a series of 
articles by the author, originally published in Educational 
Foundations.

  THE SCHOOL AND ITS LIFE 
CHAPTER I 
SomE PROBLEMS 
THE literature of the psychological and philosophical 
phases of education is vast and reasonably sufficient; that of 
its practical aspects is meager and unsatisfactory. 
The aim of this book is to discuss a few of 3. Book 
the practical problems of school administration to Discuss 
with the hope that further discussion by other Practical 
writers engaged in school work may be stimulated. De 
These practical problems are many, difficult, and 
apparently far from solution. Our philosophies of edu- 
cation and our practices are sadly out of harmony. We have 
yet to find the point of contact between them. 
The problems of education are both psychological and 
sociological. If it were possible to consider separately the 
two classes and weigh them, it would undoubtedly appear 
that the latter is the more important, but stress has: been * 
laid chiefly on the psychological. 
The late Dr. Amold Tompkins in his admirable treatise 
on the Philosophy of Teaching states that a school primarily 
consists of a self-educating pupil. If education is purely 
a psychical process, this is true; if it is largely a social pro- 
cess, the statement is only partially true. Indeed, the single 
pupil is not a school at all.

2 The School and Its Life 
If we view education in its entirety, the first article in our | 
creed must be, “We believe that the function of the school 
The Schow iS to train youth into social efficiency.” Hence it 
toTrain follows inevitably that the training must be social; 
for Social the school must be a social institution, and the 
Efficiency. chief practical problems of school administration 
are social problems. They deal with people in relation to one 
another. 
Necessarily in all discussion of educational questions the 
individual child must be the center, yet considered not 
chiefly as a psychical unit, but rather as a part of a larger --— 
social unity. 
It is true that we cannot in theory draw a sharp distinction 
between psychology and sociology as the basis for teaching. 
Sharp A child cannot receive the best psychical training 
Distinc- | without a recognition of his social needs. The 
tions highest type of individual is developed not in iso- 
ees lation, but in society. Rasselas, solitary with his 
solitary teacher, represents a very poor school indeed. 
Nor can we train a child for society without considering 
his psychical needs. Indeed these needs constitute the neces- 
sary groundwork of all teaching, and the only true criterion 
of a school is the extent to which it satisfies them. But these 
needs include fitness to mingle with others effectively. 
Hence the practical problems which we are to discuss in 
these pages are mainly sociological problems. Within the 
Deven limit prescribed, it will be possible to discuss but a 
Problems few, selected from the countless number facing 
Chiefly every one who is concerned with the administra- 
Sociolog- tion of school affairs, and these will mainly be taken 
et from the field of the elementary school. They 
include questions arising in the single school with its one

  Some Problems 3 
teacher and one class, and those arising in the school system, 
whether that system be housed under one roof and directed 
by a principal, or include the many houses and many schools 
of a great city or a state and be governed by many officials 
with an extensive and elaborate machinery. 
In the former class the problems are simpler and fewer 
but fundamental in character. Here the children are 
trained. Here the real work of school education is carried 
on. The problems arising in the system of schools are many 
and large. But they all have one common factor, the school, 
and their solution must always include the answer to one 
question, viz.: How can the system be made to aid the teacher 
in his work in the individual school? For here is the root of 
the matter. In the individual school each child is to be 
trained to serviceable life in society, and the excellence of a 
system, large or small, is measured, not by the impressive- 
ness of its mechanism nor the brilliancy of the educational 
theories exploited, but by its efficiency in furthering the 
work of the single teacher with the single class. 
The first questions to consider then are those which con- 
cern the individual school. Some of them are these: What 
are the proper personal relations between teacher propjems of 
and pupils and how are they to be secured? What the Single 
attitude toward the work and the children should School. 
the teacher professionally assume? What kind and degree 
of liberty should be conceded to the pupils? How can their 
aims and endeavors for the conduct of the school be brought 
into harmony with those of the teacher? To what degree 
and in what way may the school be made a democratic 
institution ? 
How may intelligent self-direction for altruistic ends be 
cultivated in the children? What should be the relations y 
— 
er ‘
-P-A-G-E-12

of the children to one another and how should these be brought 
about ? 
How may the highest degree of intellectual vigor be se- 
cured in the pupils and how shall it be employed so as best 
to equip them for successful living ? 
How shall the teacher reconcile the claims of the individual 
children, in particular the exceptional ones, with the de- 
mands of the school as a whole? 
These and many more questions are involved in the one 
great and elemental question: How may the school be so 
organized and administered as best to attain its true purpose, 
that of educating children into social efficiency ? 
But the smallest single school in the smallest and most 
remote rural schoolhouse has other problems to meet than 
these. Although it is in itself a social whole, it is yet a part 
of a larger society with which it has many points of contact 
and to which it is accountable. Indeed it is to these relations 
that its very existence is due. Hence in its administration 
they must be considered. The school is after all but a small 
part of that life which is education, and it is only as it per- 
forms its functions in proper relation to the influences making 
the larger part, that it is most efficient. 
So it becomes necessary to consider the relations of the 
teacher and the school to the homes from which the children 
come, and this necessity frequently raises questions both deli- 
cate and difficult. What are the respective limits of authority 
of the home and the school? How may both be brought 
to recognize their own limitations? How may the best in 
the home be made to strengthen the school, and how may 
the school stimulate and aid the higher life of the home? 
Further, we are coming to recognize the fact that the 
school with its equipment has social functions of a high

order in the general community life. These too must be 
taken account of in the administration of the school. How 
may the school be made to stimulate the intellectual and 
moral activities of the community? What use should be 
made of its building, its library and other equipment, for 
higher social purposes ? 
These are some of the practical questions arising in con- 
nection with the administration of the individual school. 
When we advance from the single school to the school 
system we find the problems increasing rapidly in number 
and complexity. The teacher then becomes one 
of many. His functions become specialized. He Problems

tions as the relations of the teachers to one another, 
both those who are doing the work of the same grade and 
those working in different grades; the relations between 
teachers and the various supervising officers; the relations 
of these officials to one another; the relations of all to the 
people’s representatives in authority over them, as school 
boards, school committees, and the like. How may the nec- 
essary machinery of a system accomplish its purpose and yet 
not hinder the work of the individual teacher with the indi- 
vidual children but rather reinforce it? What relations 
should local systems bear to state and national systems? 
What relations should school organization bear to the gen- 
eral government, local, state, and national ? 
With the development of school systems in large com- 
munities, too, come increasingly difficult problems concerning 
the relations of the schools to the community life. How 
may bureaucracy be avoided and the schools remain in close 
touch with the people, responsive to their felt needs? How
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 The School and Its Life 
may the extensive and expensive plants of the school sys- 
tems be used to stimulate the higher community life ? 
These are some of the questions of practical school admin- 
istration which need careful consideration and more abun- 
dant discussion than they have received. As stated at the 
outset, in this book I shall endeavor to state more fully some 
of them, not to settle them, — with the hope that others may 
follow with the results of their experience.

THE ScHOOL AND ScHooL LIFE 
VA. scuoot is a social institution. Reduced to its lowest 
terms the society consists of two — a teacher and a learner./\/ 
As ordinarily found it consists of a teacher and gopool a 
several learners. It is aunity in variety. There Social 
is severalty in its composition, unity in its aim. Institution. 
Yet this unity of aim is different from that in an industrial 
institution. The school aims not to put forth a single, com- 
mon product as does a factory. The product is as multi- 
farious as the component parts of the community. It is 
individual, not common. But the life is common in its aim, 
its method, and its spirit. There are community of interest, 
community of purpose, community of means and activities, 
but not uniformity of product. 
To keep this balance, so that the common life shall be 
preserved and at the same time the individual need-and the 
individual aspiration satisfied, so that each shall contribute 
to the general welfare and at the same time derive.the utmost 
individual good from the common life — this is the great 
problem of school administration. 
The bond which makes the school a community is spiritual, \ 
not material. It is not the one room in which its mem- 
bers work, nor the one course of study which they pursue, 
nor the uniform text-books which they use, but rather the 
community of aim, the unity of spirit which actuates them.

    8 The School and Its Life 
Dr. Amold Tompkins has said that a school is a spiritual 
union of teacher and pupil. This is true of the school in its 
Schoola lowest terms. It is equally true that an ideal 
Spiritual school of larger size is a spiritual union of teacher 
Union. and pupils. It is not merely a union of the teacher 
with each pupil, nor with the school as a whole. It is rather 
a union of all with all. The union of pupil with pupil, of 
each pupil with all the others, is quite as essential as that of 
the teacher with the pupils. The teacher is the active, con- 
scious, unifying force. Only such a school can serve the 
real end of education, which is social efficiency in each indi- 
vidual member of the community. 
A school, then, is a community, consisting of teacher and 
pupils, who are living together a conscious, purposeful life; 
whose aim is the growth of its members in knowledge, wis- 
dom, righteousness, and social efficiency. 
This school community has as its unifying agencies, its 
common ideals, its morale, its conventions, its occupa- 
tions. 
These four elements constitute a single life; they cannot 
be separated. Even if those who direct the school adminis- 
Rone tration are unconscious or regardless of some of 
Elements of them, they are all present. School life, like all 
School Life. spiritual and community life, is composed of these 
elements, and here, as everywhere, all conscious or uncon- 
scious ignoring of any of them brings disaster. 
Many a hard-working, conscientious teacher struggles so 
earnestly to secure certain results in the more manifest

  The School and School Life 9 
and the training for social efficiency is either negative or 
positively evil. This is especially apt to be the case when 
marks, prizes, and examinations are the stimuli and criteria 
employed. When secondary ends rather than primary are 
placed as the objects of effort, the life as a whole is low, 
and hence the training as a whole is toward evil habits of 
thought and is distinctly degrading. 
Therefore in planning and conducting the administration 
of a school, immediate and patent “ results” must often be 
subordinated to more remote and less obvious ends. In 
the education of souls, material and manifest criteria are 
dangerous and need to be employed with great discretion.

society, and the school whose pupils can secure the highest 
marks in examination is by no means always the best 
school. It does not necessarily even impart the most 
knowledge. It is the school life in its entirety that counts 
in preparation for the larger life of the larger society of 
after years. 
For the sake of clearness, however, it will be necessary 
to deal somewhat separately with the various elements of 
school life, ideals, morale, conventions, and occupations, and 
it will be simpler to treat of the last first, since the spirit, 
method, and subject-matter of school occupation constitute 
the principal factor, next to the teacher himself, in deter- 
mining the character of the school life. 
SCHOOL OCCUPATION 
The popular statement of the purpose for which children 
go to school is “to learn.” The accumulation of knowledge
-P-A-G-E-18
    10 The School and Its Life 
is the conspicuous motive of the occupations which employ 
Children their time while there. This is inevitable. The 
Go to possession of knowledge is unquestionably one 
Schoolto of the absolutely essential conditions of suc- 
en cessful living and, besides, it is one of the most 
easily tested results of effort. Hence in the average school 
all effort centers in this one aim. Children do go to school 
to learn, and if they learn, especially if they learn those things 
which have become the conventional requirements of school, 
parents and teachers are usually satisfied. 
Knowledge, however, important as_it is, is but one of the 
desirable results of school activities. Indeed, unless it is 
enawisies accompanied by other results, knowledge itself is 
but One nearly valueless. Acuteness of perception, judg- 
of the ment, reasoning power, alertness, breadth, and 
Results. levation of interest are among the intellectual 
attainments which should accompany knowledge, grow out 
of it, and make it practically available, and these should 
all be secured through the occupations of the school life. 
Moreover, much of the moral and social training essential 
to worthy living is the product of properly organized work. 
Indeed the occupations of people, both in school 
and in the larger life, are largely responsible for 
their ideals. In a well-ordered life the moral and 
industrial elements are well-nigh indistinguishable. Life 
is one, and what we do is almost of necessity in harmony with 
what we believe and what we aspire to. Occupation 
the Key. 
COURSE OF STUDY 
The occupations of the school are usually laid down with 
more or less definiteness in a course of study. 
It is not my purpose at this point to treat the course of
-P-A-G-E-19
  The School and School Life II 
study in any detail. But it seems proper to state a few 
principles underlying all good courses in order that the rela- 
tions of occupation to school life in its totality may appear 
and the unity of it all may be more manifest. 
A course of study should be both mandatory and sugges- 
tive; mandatory as to broad plan and purpose, and suggestive 
as to details, methods, and material. It should . : . Ses Course of 
be such as will stimulate intellectual activity and gtuay both 
develop initiative in both teacher and pupils. It Mandatory 
should recognize the differences in minds and the #74 Sug- 
fact that to compel one mind to follow exactly the Ee 
routine laid down by another is weakening, not strengthen- 
ing. The great danger of organized education is the ten- 
dency to produce that similarity of product which indicates 
machine make. Hence the suggestiveness and the stimulat- 
ing quality of a course of study are more important than even 
the mandatory general plan. 
The latter, however, is necessary for,;the avoidance of 
vagueness and desultoriness of wor! course of study 
must require that certain results be accomplished at certain 
stages, and it must encourage and stimulate teachers to 
find the best way of accomplishing these results. 
A course of study must indicate a body of knowledge to c 
be acquired and a range of activities to be engaged in. The 
former should be broad, so as to establish many Duality of 
points of contact with the world. The latter Course of 
should be wide, so as to exercise and develop all Study. 
the potentialities of nascent minds. The relations between 
the two should be very close. 
The activities required should be upon objects evidently 
worth while, in the main those connected with the body of 
knowledge presented. There is a tendency among the
-P-A-G-E-20
  12 The School and Its Life 
makers of text-books, and among teachers as well, to devise 
work which exercises but a few of the natural activities of 
the mind, and to ding-dong upon these with wearisome itera- 
tion, while pursuing that will-o’-the-wisp of elementary 
education, thoroughness. Drill for drill’s sake is a positive 
fetich with many, especially in mathematics and the lan- 
guages, including the mother tongue. Such drill is worse 
than waste. It deadens interest and defeats its own ends 
by limiting and, in some cases, actually arresting growth. 
Every exercise should have an evident motive beyond 
itself. If the subject is reading, the golden end should be 
very appreciation of the matter read; if language, the

of expression. These higher and remoter ends should be 
evident to the children. This ennobles drill and makes it 
seem worth while. It supplies the motive, which alone makes 
drudgery possible to active minds. 
Abundant drill in all departments can always be secured 
upon problems that are vital. Life is full of such real prob- 
lems even for children, and their mastery constitutes the 
truest education, it even furnishes the best drill. A boy 
making a boot-blacking box in the manual training shop, 
doing his own computing, measuring, drawing, and fitting, 
is getting better mathematical drill within the range of his 
work than any mere memorizing and repetition of the words 
of a table of measurements can possibly give him. 
This suggests another fundamental principle of a good 
Correlation course of study, a close observance of the nat-

and the)xarious activities engaged in. In life nothing

stands alone, all is related; so in the true school, which is a 
microcosm, an epitome of life. 
The purpose of a course of study for elementary schools 
y be summarized as follows: 
A course of study for elementary schools should supply 
the teachers with working material which they may employ 
in the training of the children. Its business is not s . a % Course of 
to state in definite terms just what the teacher is to Study Must 
do each day, but rather to map out in a broad way Supply 
those activities, exercises, and fields of knowledge Working 
which experience has shown to be most suitable peous 
for the elementary school, and to suggest to the teachers 
methods of enlarging this work and of preparing themselves 
to perform it. It should take into consideration such facts 
concerning children as the study of child life has made clear, 
the character of the civilization in which the child is to be a 
factor, and the means necessary to make him a most effec- 
tive voluntary factor for good in his community. It must 
supply such activities as will best stimulate growth, such 
discipline as will produce the finest culture and make it 
possible for him to express himself adequately for the bene- 
fit of others; it must suggest such knowledge as will help 
him to take hold of nature effectively and comprehend what 
others have done and expressed. It must involve also such 
a vital acquaintance with social, economic, and ethical con- 
ditions as is required for good citizenship. 
The principles outlined above for the occupations of 
the schoolroom being accepted, the teacher has a working 
basis for the organization of the school. His first First, Get

If the school be one of a graded system the work for the

  14 The School and Its Life 
different pupils will be similar, if not uniform; there will 
still be need for the study of individual conditions, but the 
general plan will be predetermined, and the material at 
hand. 
If the school be a rural or ungraded one the task of initial 
organization will be much more difficult. Here the work 
Graded ana Will be largely individual and the consideration of 
Ungraded the needs of single pupils will force itself at 
Schools once upon the teacher’s attention. Here, too, 
Compare itis especially difficult to preserve the social unity 
of the school community. Diversity of age, attainment, 
and work tend to undue accentuation of the individual and 
to unfortunate loss of social motive; while in the graded 
school the danger is that the individual will be so merged 
in the social whole as to lose his distinct personal claim to 
attention and the recognition of his right to individual develop- 
ment. In the rural school common activities must be de- 
vised and encouraged and common interests aroused. In 
the graded school, individual activities, work for individual 
ends, must be planned, and the tastes, needs, and aptitudes 
of individual children must be noted and provided for. For 
in both, the end, social efficiency, must be kept in mind, and 
this requires the fullest development of individual power 
and the fullest comprehension of social relations and obli- 
gations. Each is necessary to the other. The individual 
is fully developed only in society, and society prospers only 
when its individual members are full-grown. 
Hence, the school, whether graded or ungraded, must be 
so organized as properly to balance the individual and social 
demands of true education. 
The administration of the school must also provide that 
both divisions of the course of study receive due attention —
-P-A-G-E-23
  The School and School Life 15 
the body of knowledge and the range of activities. The 
process of education may be described as growth through 
nutrition and exercise, or, as more commonly put, paucation 
through learning and expression. Hence these is Growth

not only in the course of study, but also in the eon 
administration of the school. Indeed, they cannot be sepa- 
rated. There is no learning without corresponding expres- 
sion. Memorizing is not, necessarily, learning at all in 
the true sense. Unless the whole mind is em- Bepresion 
ployed there is no nutrition. Consequently, there Necessary

Where expression is ignored the learning is ™® 
bogus; it does not enter into the make-up of the mind. In 
such schools, only when acquisition in the school is supple- 
mented by the activities of the life out of school is there 
true learning at all, and, as this supplementing is casual 
and unreliable, it is evident that much of the effort of the 
schoolroom is wasted. 
So the school must provide an abundance of activities 
which shall utilize and make vital, through expression, the 
matter presented for learning. 
The greatest lack of our schools to-day seems to me to 
be that of suitable provision for just this serious productive 
work by the pupils. Studying is still too largely Lact of

from verbal, knowledge. Pupils in the average school do 
not do enough of real work. They spend hours enough, 
use up nervous energy enough, get tired enough, but they 
do not work enough. Provision must be made in the school
-P-A-G-E-24
  16 The School and Its Life 
for a sufficient amount of independent, strength-producing 
work. This means that the school must be so organized 
that each pupil may have the opportunity and be compelled 
to work alone and unaided upon problems that bring into 
use all his energies, producing results that appeal to him 
as worth producing. 
THE GRADED SCHOOL 
Let us consider first the graded school. As has been 
Danger of Pointed out, one of the principal dangers of this 
Loss in the school is that the child may be swallowed up by 
Machine. the machine; that the social whole may so absorb 
the individual that his effort for individual ends may be 
discouraged. 
MASS TEACHING 
Another grave danger of the graded school is that the

he must, himself, work out his own salvation. The teacher 
is always there, ready to supply the deficiencies of the weak, 
himself supplementing the child’s effort, that the beautiful 
uniformity of the class gradation may not be broken. 
The most pernicious form of mass teaching is found in 
those schools in which the entire roomful of children does the 
same things at the same time — recites together, studies to- 
gether, with the teacher always present, helping, suggesting, 
telling. These schools represent the complete absorption 
of the individual. They do not stand for even good social

training, which develops the individual as fully as possible 
for social efficiency; for social efficiency requires completely 
educated, self-directing individuals able to use all the strength 
of individuality for social ends. 
Mass teaching so completely subordinates the individual 
that his efforts become mechanical. He cannot move alone; 
he moves with the mass. He is not self-directing; he has 
no power of initiative; he follows a leader, if there is one; 
if not, he follows the crowd. : 
THE GROUP SYSTEM 
The Group System of organization in large graded schools 
is almost necessary to this development of personal power. 
It is impossible and undesirable to have each Advantage 
pupil work altogether independently. That of Groups. 
would be the other extreme. But it is both possible and 
desirable to have the school so organized into groups that 
both the social and the individual training necessary shall 
be secured. 
The number of groups will depend, naturally, upon the 
size of the school, its grade, and the character of the work to be 
done. In primary grades there should be more groups than 
in the grammar grades. A primary grade of forty or fifty 
pupils may profitably be divided into three or four groups. 
The grouping, to a considerable degree, should be accord- 
ing to ability to do the work. This facilitates frequent 
promotion and gives the individual a chance. The differ- 
ences will be slight and children can be moved from one 
group to another, according to their particular needs, with- 
out causing undue elation or a sense of degradation. 
More important still, it makes possible such work, both 
social and individual, as a wise education requires.
-P-A-G-E-26
  18 The School and Its Life 
These groups should be employed in different occupations. 
The teacher should be busy with one, in what is commonly 
called the recitation, an exercise wherein that which has 
been accomplished by the children working alone is tested, 
instruction given, suggestion offered, employment outlined for 
the future, and, in general, that directive and inspirational 
work done which is the teacher’s commonly recognized 
function. 
This is the test period, which, perhaps more than any 
other, shows to the teacher, and to the children themselves, 
The the value and meaning of the work of the school. 
Recitation It is the time for interchanging thought, for clari- 
the Test. fying ideas, for informing minds. But this reci- 
tation period can attain its highest effectiveness only when 
the other work has been skilfully directed and well done. 
A group as small as ten or fifteen can be in very close 
relations with the teacher during the recitation period. 
Each individual child can receive considerable attention 
and can become really known by the teacher. A teacher 
with forty-five primary pupils, in forty-five minutes, can 
do very much more for each child if she spends fifteen 
minutes with each of three groups than if she has them all 
for forty-five minutes together, and, besides this, each child 
can have had thirty minutes of quiet individual work, 
undisturbed by the iteration of the teacher.

of the day. The changes should be of sufficient ones 
frequency to avoid undue fatigue, and the problems 
should be “real”? and educative. This occupation should 
not be play, but should be serious work, tending toward 
the end of the school, growth through nutrition and exer- 
cise. 
Children so organized and directed will work with genuine 
joy and earnestness, realizing that they are accomplishing 
something worth while. Such an arrangement also solves 
the question of the so-called “discipline” of the school; but 
I will speak of that later. 
A roomful of children thus occupied, one group eagerly 
busy with the teacher in the recitation, while the others 
are working by themselves—one group at a blackboard solving 
problems in arithmetic, another at their desks writing a 
language exercise, or standing about a large table, painting, 
or, perhaps, gathered about a “sand table,” working out 
together, with the sand and cardboard and other construc- 
tive material, the story of the Trojan war, all eager and 
absorbed in the work in hand, while the teacher, gently 
and almost unobserved, guides it all — such a school forms 
a beautiful and inspiring spectacle. And the best of it is, 
children so engaged are receiving real education. They 
are exercising their minds independently and yet in society. 
They are gaining strength and the power of self-direc- 
tion through self-direction. They are developing thought

and are expressing it, thus making the facts they learn 
nutritive. 
In higher grades two groups are enough. The pupils 
here are capable of longer continued exertion. There is, 
Number of necessarily and properly, more conning of books. 
Groups. There is less need of frequent motor activity. 
There is more of what we commonly call study, and this 
can be continued for longer periods of time. Nor is there 
quite the same need for the close, individual attention of 
the teacher possible in the smaller groups. 
In grammar grades of forty pupils, two classes of twenty 
each, with half-hour recitation periods, secure excellent 
results. There is here abundant opportunity for unaided 
study, a prerequisite of mental strength, and there is time 
in plenty for recitation purposes. 
Naturally, many of the exercises of the schoolroom are 
better carried on by the whole school together. Such are 
music, formal drawing lessons — all exercises which do not 
require individual recitations, but in which all pupils neces- 
sarily take part during the whole time. Such general exer- 
cises are valuable, also, for social training and should on no 
account be neglected. But most of the school work can 
be more successfully carried on in groups. In particular 
this plan makes possible that unaided, individual work 
which is absolutely necessary for the development of power. 
Such an arrangement as has been outlined necessitates 
careful preparation on the part of the teacher; it requires

But the care is compensated for in the interest produced,

the power of self-direction developed, and the superior 
order resulting. 
THE UNGRADED SCHOOL 
In the ungraded school a different sort of organization 
is required. Combination, rather than segregation, is needed 
here. Children should be grouped upon such f Co-opera- 
common problems as are possible. They may tive pxer- 
be problems of nature study, for which abundant cises in 
material is at hand. They may be problems of Ungraded 
construction, the making of simple pieces of ap- rk 
paratus for the use of the school, or the maintaining of school 
gardens for the study of simple agricultural or horticultural 
questions. Or the common work may be the making and 
solving of arithmetical problems relating to the school or the 
community life, such as measurements and computations 
for the construction of buildings for rural use, or the laying 
out of land for gardens or farms. It may be the study of 
geography or history or literature, to which each child con- 
tributes what he has been able to learn through his personal 
investigation or research. 
In the ungraded school especial care should be taken 
with the general exercises in which the whole school is en- 
gaged — singing, drawing, debates, spelling-matches, special 
oratorical and declamatory exercises of various kinds. The 
children should be led to do co-operatively as many things 
as possible, each contributing his share. 
For social training, in all schools, much use may properly 
be made of special days — such days as the birthdays of 
authors and statesmen and other prominent persons. The 
decoration of school rooms and school grounds, too, offers 
fine opportunities for community work of an altruistic sort.

Children should be led to see that social betterment comes 
through the combined efforts of many, each contributing 
his share. I cannot refrain from repeating, education is to

CHAPTER III 
THE MoRALE OF THE SCHOOL 
In the preceding chapter the occupations of the school 
were discussed as being the key to the entire school life, 
the first thing which the teacher must consider and the 
one thing which must be rightly conducted, if the school 
is to fulfil its function. We will now consider in particular 
the conduct of children in school, its kind, the motives which 
should underlie it, and the observance of proper conven- 
tionalities. F 
There are many erroneous notions and there is much false 
preaching on the subject of what is called “school discipline,” 
meaning the preservation of order. The great ee 
struggle with the majority of teachers is to keep «piggi- 
order; more teachers fail in this respect than in pline’some- 
any other, and many of them fail largely because times 
of their strenuous attempts to succeed in this one ere 
line as if, order being Heaven’s first law, it were the one 
thing for which children come to school. The “‘discipline” 
of the school is in a manner separated from the work of the 
school and made a particular feature, and some teachers 
boast with more pride of their success in keeping order 
than of their success in teaching. 
There are a few fundamental principles underlying this 
whole question of school “discipline” which it is well to 
study, although they are not new. Conduct rests upon 
23
-P-A-G-E-32
24. The School and Its Life 
two classes of motives which in most of us are so 
Conven- ‘inextricably mixed that we cannot distinguish 
/tionsand one from the other. One is convention and 
/ Law of the other the inner law of right based upon 
\ pent reason. 
CONVENTION 
Convention is necessary to the smooth running of the 
Value of Social machine. People who must live together, 
Conven- of necessity must have certain conventions; 
tions. there must be agreement, at least as to the 
externals of life, but these conventions, to be really 
valuable, must be founded upon rational motive. 
It is sometimes said that there are two motives which 
prompt the keeping of order in school. One is to secure 
conditions suitable for doing the work of the school, and the 
other is to insure a training in morals. The distinction is 
unwise. If the conventions of the school are essential to 
good work, obedience to them constitutes a training in good 
morals; if they are not essential to good work in the school, 
insistence upon obedience to them means training in bad 
morals. Much evil arises from the fact that the conventions 
upon which stress is laid are frequently not essential to the 
well-being of the school, but are purely or partially arbitrary. 
The conventions of the school most commonly named 
N are silence, punctuality, attention, and prompt obedience. 
These are all, directly or indirectly, connected with morals 
according to the circumstances. Silence, for instance, may 
be a virtue or it may not. In those instances in which noise 
would interfere with the study of the pupils or with the reci- 
tation, silence is necessary, and to enforce it is to train in good 
morals; but teachers are quite too apt to love it for its own
-P-A-G-E-33
  The Morale of the School 25 
sake and to insist upon it when it has no bearing upon the 
well-being of the school. Silence suggests death, and among 
the deadest schools I have ever seen have been those in which 
arbitrarily, without cause, silence was always enforced. 
This is hardly the place to discuss the foundations of 
morality in detail since this would involve more time and 
more far-reaching controversy than is the purpose orality a 
of this book. But in general it may be said that Relative 
the term morality is a purely relative term; it has Term. 
to do with the relations of men with men. A solitary being, 
if such a being could be imagined, would be without morals. 
If we accept the very simplest definition of morality, namely 
right conduct, we must admit that conduct is right or wrong 
solely with reference to its end and the relations involved. 
What is right at one time and place may be wholly wrong 
at another. 
Every phase of life, every social institution, must of neces- 
sity have its own rules of conduct. These rules are usually 
crystallized into conventions. People who are canes 
associated in any definite enterprise, or for any tions for 
purpose, for a length of time, naturally discover Special 
what kind of conduct best makes for the ends of Phases 
the association, and out of this recognition ulti- one 
mately grows a set of rules or conventions, sometimes for- 
mulated and sometimes not formulated, which govern the 
members of the association. Ina sense they enforce them- 
selves. Those who violate them interfere with the success 
of the organization and are compelled either to leave it or 
to conform to its regulations. 
In a business house for instance, there are conventions 
which make it possible to carry on business successfully, — 
regulations as to the hours of service, as to the recognition
-P-A-G-E-34
  26 The School and Its Life 
of the authority of those who are in responsible positions, 
and as to what each one is to do and at what times and 
in what ways. These rules are local in bearing and limited 
in their significance. They would not apply to a church 
or a theater. The church, too, has its conventions which 
grow out of the conditions involved. People who meet to 
worship together, realizing the need of such conditions as 
tend to secure a worshipful mind, insist that all who come 
must conduct themselves accordingly. There must be a 
quiet, reverential attitude, certain participation in the exer- 
cises, and a general co-operation in securing the purpose 
of the assemblage. In a theater or in a public lecture- 
room where we go to listen to what one or more people 
are saying, there is required a different sort of conduct, 
but one which fits the occasion. So in a school certain 
conventions are necessary. Teachers must be able to teach 
and children to study and recite without being disturbed by 
others. There are, moreover, conventions of a wider reach, 
those that belong to the business world as a whole or to 
the religious world as a whole. 
Now, these conventions are not the mere fabrications of 
ingenious people foisted upon the members of the or- 
ganization or association, nor are they artificial, Conven- ss 
tions Rest though they may seem so. In the first instance 
upon Fun- they rest upon certain fundamental principles 
ieee which are the basis of sound morality; these are 
Ps: the right of all people to perform any legitimate 
act without being interfered with unduly by others, and the 
obligation resting upon all to respect that right in others. 
Such conventions not only rest upon sound principles, but 
they are absolutely necessary to the smooth running of the 
world’s machinery. 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  The Morale of the School 27 
Primarily the word morals means manners. Good morals 
are good manners or good methods of conduct in relation 
to other people, and are based upon the obligation Manners 
of all people to help all others, to facilitate all and Morals. 
useful activity, and to make the world, in so far as possible, 
a desirable and pleasant place to live in. Good table man- 
ners, for instance, are distinctly good morals, and bad table 
manners are bad morals as distinctly as are the grosser 
violations of what are commonly recognized as moral laws. 
Good manners make the world a happier and better place 
to live in, facilitate profitable and agreeable intercourse 
among people and render easier the accomplishment of the 
world’s work. 
The man who steals does wrong, of course. He interferes 
with his neighbor’s rights; but the man who, by bad manners, 
disturbs an audience in a church or lecture-room or theater, 
or passengers in a street car, or pedestrians upon a side- 
walk, or students in a school, also does wrong. He inter- 
feres with the right of others to the pursuit of happiness and 
to that peace of mind which is necessary to the accomplish- 
ment of the best work. This is the moral basis for moral 
conventions and for all those regulations which, whether 
written or unwritten —more commonly the latter — are uni- 
versally recognized as guides in the intercourse of human 
beings. In all cases their value is tested by their fitness. 
It is true that in school and in other places conventions 
sometimes become fetiches, the mere form of good conduct 
takes the place of the spirit of it, artificial Chester- Cie

best, which constitute really good manners. When so 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 The School and Its Life 
substituted the moral element is lost. Such manners, while 
sometimes desirable, have no deep foundation, and it is to 
be borne in mind that all rules of conduct are valuable only 
in so much as they further some worthy end. Consequently 
in school it is impossible to separate the conventions which 
make for the well-being and successful administration of 
the school from those rules of conduct which are supposed 
to make for character. These two are one, and in deter- 
mining what kind of conduct should be required in school 
we need to go no further than to ascertain the purpose of the 
school. 
CHARACTER THE PRODUCT OF LIFE 
If the purpose of the school is worthy and high the con- 
duct that furthers it will make for good character. If the 
Character Purpose of the school is not high and worthy, and 
is Conduct if conduct therein is supported merely by artificial 
Crystal- conventions, it is impossible to add any system of 
eee rules that will contribute to the building of good 
character. Character is the result of the life lived, and 
the life lived is one. There is altogether too great a ten- 
dency, especially in the fields of ethics and religion, to seek 
to separate that conduct which has to do with the common 
affairs of life from that which has to do with what is some- 
times called the higher morality. 
The life we live in pursuing the common necessary ends 
is both determined by and determines our characters. As 
was pointed out in the preceding chapter, it is impossible 
to separate character from occupation. It is what we do 
daily and continually when pursuing our vocations, when 
not thinking of moral questions, that shows what we are and 
crystallizes conduct into character.
-P-A-G-E-37
  The Morale of the School 29

is social efficiency, and whatever of moral training there

moral training, the school itself must be a proper institu- 
tion. Its ends must be high and its occupation must be 
both noble and ennobling; they must so exercise the whole 
child that inevitably he is led into high living. The term 
“discipline,” much misused in relation to school life, is a 
bogy, because teachers too commonly seek to separate con- 
duct in the school from occupation. 
THE SOURCES OF DISORDER 
In schools that are really disorderly the trouble is usually 
to be found in one or more of three common conditions: 
the character of the teacher, which may be gources of 
positively bad, merely weak and unimpressive, Disorder 
or ultra-sentimental; the character of the work imSchool. 
required, which may be either upon a low plane or so pre- 
sented to the children that they fail to see the good in it and 
to realize its worth; the enforcement of conventions resting 
upon no sound moral principle. The last mentioned has 
already been sufficiently considered. 
As to the first, nothing need be said here, except for the 
sake of the ultra-sentimentalists who fail to recognize the 
necessity of any control in a school if the work is interesting. 
I have seen teachers with high ideals and really noble views 
of education fail utterly because of their lack of will or be- 
cause they have not sought to impress themselves upon the 
school. An organization must have a head, and in all
-P-A-G-E-38
  30 The School and Its Life 
associations of people for a common end there must be 
some directing force, and as practically all associations con- 
tain some unfortunates with diseased wills, due frequently to 
bad training in early life, authority is needed either to con- 
trol or to expel these makers of mischief. Even in the freest 
schools there must be felt the pervasive presence of the 
teacher. Such presence does not interfere with the develop- 
ment of the individual or the cultivation of self-control. It 
is simply necessary to secure social harmony. A teacher 
does not need to be a boss. Bossism is fatal to the higher 
ends of the school. But a teacher must have will and be 
able to exercise it vigorously though wisely for the common 
good. 
OBEDIENCE 
It may be well to say here something upon the subject of 
obedience, in order that what I may say later may not 
Obedience a be misunderstood. Obedience is not in itself a 
Temporary virtue, it may be a weak vice, but it is in almost 
Necessity. all societies an occasional and often a continual 
necessity. In the school where the teacher is dealing with 
young and growing minds, obedience must be maintained; 
in order that the essential conditions of a good school may 
be secured it is a preliminary necessity, a crutch to aid the 
weak until able to walk alone, but it should be used spar- 
ingly. The teacher should not require it for its own sake, 
but merely to secure necessary conditions and to make the 
children ready to control themselves. It should always lead 
to self-control and should gradually be dropped out of 
sight as the power of self-direction is secured, but it must 
still be potentially present and ready for use in emergencies. 
Pupils must obey when it is necessary, even unquestioningly,
-P-A-G-E-39
The Morale of the School 31 
but they should never be called upon to obey unquestioningly 
unless it is necessary, and such obedience should, in so far 
as possible, rest upon faith in the superior wisdom of the 
teacher. The business of the teacher is to secure not merely 
temporary conditions, but permanent conditions, and so 
to train the children to work from motive that they can and 
will do this when the teacher’s directing and controlling 
power is removed. In short, children must mind. It is 
natural to rebel against authority when it is not exercised 
for any evident good motive, and children are eminently 
natural. In the school in which there are an abundance 
of red tape, innumerable petty rules of order and rigid en- 
forcement of compliance thereto, there are always rebellion, 
at least potential, and actual deceit and hypocrisy. 
The natural tendency above mentioned prompts chil- 
dren ‘to seek to subvert the will of the martinet disciplinarian, 
openly if they dare, by deception if they do not. pyy 
Rigidly enforced rules without an evident, worthy Effects of 
reason behind them are fatal to character in those Martinet 
who are subject to them. A teacher should be very Discipline. 
slow in making rules and should always ask, before promul- 
gating one, “Is it absolutely necessary to the well-being of 
this society? Could not the end aimed at be secured in 
some other way and can it be secured in this way?” For we 
must not forget that children should live in school a sane 
life for ends which appeal to them, that they may lead such 
lives after they leave school. 
I recall in a western city a school which was famous for 
its “discipline.” The pupils always moved with machine- 
like uniformity; everything was done beautifully so far as 
the eye could see; silence was rigidly maintained; all the 
petty conventions that ingenuity could devise were enforced
-P-A-G-E-40
  32 The School and Its Life 
with the method of the martinet and, as with Katisha’s 
shoulder, people came from miles around to see it. A 
change of administration brought to light the inner con- 
dition of the school. The moral sense of the pupils had 
been impaired; lying and whispering, having been treated 
with equal severity, had come to be regarded by them as 
equally heinous or venial crimes, and you may be sure the 
children leaned toward veniality. It took some years of 
comparatively bad order to bring about a rational moral 
sense in that school. 
As to the third point, it is not enough that the work of 
the school be on the whole wise and well planned. It must 
be so presented to the children that it will appeal Children & 5 . aust to them as worth while; otherwise they will lose

Value working for worthy ends. Children who are 
sewer simply doing what they are told to do, even if that 
is conventionally right, are not acquiring moral power. They 
must understand the motive, and if it is worthy must be 
ready to make effort, to drudge, to sacrifice for it, if they 
are to receive sound moral training.

CHAPTER IV 
Tuer Morate oF THE ScHoot (Continued) 
THE conduct required in school must grow out of the 
life of the school and must evidently further the ends of the 
school, if such conduct is to result in sound character. This 
means that the school itself should be upon a high plane, 
that the life lived should be worthy, and that the employ- 
ments, which are the key to the whole life, should be such as 
appeal to children as worth their while. 
Children go to school to learn. This is the common 
statement and in the main it is sufficiently accurate for our 
purpose. That is, they go to school to be nour- Going to

choice leads them. Learning, that is, mental 
growth, is no more unnatural than bodily growth, and the act 
of taking mental nourishment and of engaging in mental 
exercise is as natural and should be as agreeable as taking 
bodily nourishment or engaging in bodily exercise. And it 
will be so to sane children if it is adapted to them, if it fills 
their lives. One trouble with the school life is that it is 
only partially filled by the school occupation and for much 
of the time the mind is vagrant. Much of the work forced 
upon children fails to interest them because it fails to }~ 
supply any felt need.

dren are as desirous of doing things as their elders. School 
too often fails in that there is nothing given them to do that 
seems to them to lead to any definite end or to “amount to 
anything.” We are told that children must of necessity learn 
the expressive arts, reading, writing, and the rest, and so 
they must and readily will, if these lead to an apparent 
end, but young children must have a motive, and a motive 
immediate and apparent. It is hard enough for adults to 
work in the dark for remote ends; it is too much to expect 
of children. The teacher must have the remote end in 
mind, but to the child the immediate end appeals. If he 
feels that through studying a lesson he is gaining some 
desirable result, either in power among his fellows or in per- 
sonal enlargement, if he sees, for example, that by reading 
he is placed in possession of means to reach some desired 
end, it is not difficult to interest him in learning his lesson; 
but until he has some interest in what can be secured 
through reading, learning to read does not appeal strongly 
to him. The same principle applies to all the arts. 
School life then must be based upon occupation which 
has a meaning to the children. Courses of study must be

then satisfied. Children are employed in that which holds 
their attention, because through it they may hope to attain 
some worthy purpose. 
The excellence of the school is too often measured ee 
the success with which the children sit still rather than by 
the success with which they do things. This recalls the 
experience of Dr. John Dewey when looking for school 
desks for his experimental school. After visiting many 
dealers and failing to find what he wanted, he was asked 
by one to explain his need. He did so. The dealer said 
at once, “Why, you want a desk for children to work at; 
these are all for listening.” And listening has been alto- 
gether too much the business of the school from the children’s 
side. 
In a previous chapter reference was made to the dangers 
of mass teaching, and group work was advocated. What 
was there said has a direct bearing upon moral power to 
training. In a school conducted on this plan Work 
the individual not only loses his individuality Alone. 
for the time, but he loses the best opportunity for a certain 
most valuable moral training. The power to do solitary,
-P-A-G-E-44
  36 The School and Its Life 
unaided, persistent work for a worthy end is absolutely nec- 
essary, not only to business success, but to sound character. 
This power is not required in such schools. Every child, 
if he is to be strong morally, that is, able to stand alone 
and meet and overcome moral obstacles, should, during his 
period of school training, do much work alone, metaphysi- 
cally removed an infinite distance from the helping teacher. 
It should be a part of the morale of the school to encourage 
this independent, solitary work, just as in society the busy 
world must provide room for the individual worker and 
must keep out of his way. For although morality has to 
do with society and nothing else, this does not mean that 
the individual is never to be alone, or, if alone, cannot do 
right. 
SOCIAL FREEDOM 
Social freedom requires self-restraint. The members of 
society are not free unless they put checks upon themselves, 
: for anarchy is the worst foe of freedom. In a Social is Freedom State of anarchy everybody is in everybody else’s 
Requires way and no one finds himself free to do anything. 
Self- So a busy school, while not necessarily or ordi- Restraint. * a S : narily an especially quiet school, is as far removed 
from anarchy as the heavens from the earth. 
But still further, pupils in school should not only keep 
out of one another’s way, but at times should positively

mind stimulates the others and supplements the others is a 
necessary condition of society, and there is no reason why
-P-A-G-E-45
  The Morale of the School (Continued) 37 
it should not exist in school. In the recitation, naturally 
there is friction of minds and the supplementing of each by 
all the others. But there is no reason why in the working 
out of problems in different subjects there should not be 
like co-operation. Such co-operation is a most useful exer- 
cise in training for social life. It is very easy to secure it in 
such subjects as manual training. I remember some boys 
in a manual training high school making a roll-top desk 
for the superintendent of schools. I do not remember just 
how many boys were engaged upon this piece of work, but 
perhaps twenty, each one making some one part of the desk, 
upon some of the more difficult parts two or three working 
together. Those parts had to be made so that they would 
fit. There was necessarily constant consultation and com- 
parison and suggestion of one to another. It was a fine 
instance of team work and the result was not merely a beau- 
tiful desk but an abundance of the best sort of training for 
social life. It was highly moral training. A football team 
has much the same training. Great enterprises require the 
exercise of many brains, and practice in co-operation is 
most valuable. 
Mr. Camegie said recently that to make millionaires it 
was absolutely essential to take into partnership competent 
heads of departments. That means, as I under- Importance 
stand it, that a great business is developed not by of Co-oper- 
the brain of one man alone, but rather by the co- 4tion- 
operation of many. Certainly the social life of a community 
is successful only when many members work together in 
harmonious co-operation. And training for this can be 
given in the schools and should be given. Not only in the ~ 
manipulation of the shop is it possible, but in innumerable 
exercises. Investigations can be carried on in geography
-P-A-G-E-46
  38 The School and Its Life 
or history or the natural sciences, one pupil investigating 
one field and another another, all bringing in the results of 
their investigations and compiling them into a single product. 
The essential feature is that each one shall feel his personal 
responsibility for the whole and shall meet it by doing his 
part. If all the members of a community felt a personal 
responsibility for the well-being of the community we should 
at once have an ideal condition. 
All pupils of a school should come to feel a personal 
responsibility for the well-being of the school. They should 
iesronai feel that it is their institution, that it exists for 
bility for them all and not for the teacher alone. And they 
Common should be led to restrain themselves from inter- 
soon: ference with one another and to contribute with 
their best to the common good, and this condition should 
grow out of the occupation of the school, which should have 
a definite meaning to the children. Matthew Arnold’s oft- 
quoted remark, “Conduct is three fourths of life,” might 
be supplemented by another, that occupation is the key to 
conduct. It may be necessary for the teacher, on assuming 
control of a new school, for a very brief time to control the 
school by absolute will, but if it is done for more than a very 
brief time the result will be distinctly bad. Common interest 
must take the place of personal domination if the children 
are to be trained for society. 
The morale of the school must grow out of what the chil- 
dren do. Indeed, it does grow out of it. If the children do not 
do things worthy and have not enough work set by the 
teacher to employ their minds, they will do other things un- 
worthy, in violation of the teacher’s will or in ignorance of 
it, which will give a distinctly lower morale than is desirable. 
It is impossible to escape the truth that occupation largely
-P-A-G-E-47
  The Morale of the School (Continued) 39 
determines conduct, and conduct both grows out of and 
produces character. 
I desire to call attention to one corollary of what has 
already been said regarding moral training. The use of 
secondary ends as motives to conduct is always pangers of 
to be restricted to an immediate and pressing Secondary 
emergency. It should never be a continuous Ends. 
part of the school discipline. By secondary ends in school 
I mean prizes, marks, and punishments. The reasons are 
not far to seek. They concern, however, the whole field 
of ideals. The trouble with the world in so far as it is wrong 
is, of course, that people are pursuing wrong ends, commonly 
minor or secondary ends, under the mistaken notion that 
they are primary. People chase wealth, social position, and 
political power for themselves and so enter upon an endless 
pursuit and are never happy. These objects pursued are 
elusive because they are not real; they are means to ends 
and are not properly ends at all, or are merely secondary 
ends. Do we do right to wonder at the perversity of hu- 
manity in thus following unworthy ends when we see that 
in most schools secondary ends are held before the chil- 
dren until their pursuit becomes habitual? How can we 
expect children who have been taught to study for marks 
or prizes or to avoid punishment, instead of pursuing, with 
a live interest, knowledge itself, to acquire a love for truth? 
How can we expect such children, when they grow up, to 
pursue social service through the use of available means, 
instead of pursuing these means as if they were the ends 
themselves? 
By holding up prizes and marks before children as the 
ends of study, we substitute an inferior pleasure for the true 
joy of genuine attainment, and worse than all create the
-P-A-G-E-48

habit of such pursuit. There are natural defectives, or 
Marks and those in whom the moral sense and any deep 
Prizes. interest are simply inchoate, who must be treated 
as invalids, and for such, a secondary end as an induce- 
ment may be necessary; but it is absurd to say that a school 
of normally healthy children must be induced to study by 
the offer of a prize or the fear of punishment. That is a 
part of the silly nonsense that is taught by those who have 
spoiled their schools through excess of conventionality. 
Normal children are more readily attracted to what is 
worthy than to what is unworthy, and it is quite as easy for 
a good teacher to arouse interest in the real ends of school 
life as in the secondary ends, and the result is much more 
desirable.

Tue Inprvipuat CHILD 
Tue test of the efficiency of a school system, or a school, 
is the excellence of the training given the individual chil- 
dren. While there is a certain wasteful method Mass 
of instruction which we call “mass teaching,” Teaching. 
mass learning is inconceivable. In mass teaching the class 
is reduced nearly to a company of children in a listening 
attitude. Much of the teacher’s effort is necessarily wasted. 
It is like shooting at a flock of birds with an old-fashioned 
smooth-bore, “scattering” shot-gun. There is not suffi- 
cient opportunity for individual response to make it sure 
that even the listening is actual and effective. A quiet body 
with the eyes directed toward the teacher often conceals a 
vacant mind. There is almost no possibility of that vigor- 
ous reaction which is the essential of all ;., ere 
learning. If the minds of the pupils do not Requires 
actively respond, and, stimulated by the teach- @Reac- Y 
ing, put out some effort in grasping the thing %™ 
taught and relating it to its proper apperceiving center, or, 
better yet, in some expressive or productive effort, then 
there is no learning, and if the mind of any individual pupil 
does not so respond, the teaching in so far fails of effective- 
ness. 
Some teachers are more successful than others in stimu- 
lating individual minds to activity, though giving “ mass” 
41
-P-A-G-E-50
  42 The School and Its Life 
instruction. But even the strongest teachers cannot accom- 
plish the impossible, which is, in this instance, to secure the 
reaction necessary to learning when conditions forbid such 
reaction. 
The mind of each child must move vigorously to some 
end, if it is truly to learn. This would seem to look toward 
Solitary the teacher with the single pupil as the ideal 
Learning School. But this again ignores the other great 
Also essential of education, life in society. As has 
elle, been repeatedly said, if social efficiency is the end 
of education, and if the life lived is the one educative force, 
social education can come only through social living, and 
the school must be a society of many members. The best 
results cannot be produced in solitude. There must be 
reaction against the social environment as well as the intel- 
lectual, to produce the socially efficient. 
How then can the two demands be reconciled? I have 
no specific to offer, but some suggestions. Much will

of a question accurately aimed, or a startling statement, or 
a personal reference full of explosive. The vigilant teacher

ual in society. Indeed it supplies very well two essential 
conditions. 
Of course the first essential is not within the control of 
the individual teacher, but must be cared for by the boards 
of education. I mean the reduction of the number of 
pupils assigned to any teacher to a reasonable maximum. 
But no matter what the number of children, they should 
be divided into groups for work. These groups should 
be so small that the teacher may be aware of the Reactions 
sort of attention given by each child, and may Inevitable 
secure from each responses sufficiently frequent im Groups. 
and full to make plain what sort of reactions are produced. 
With small groups of children in close touch with one another 
and the teacher, some reactions are inevitable; for efforts 
at expression are constant and made by all. Each has 
something to do all the time. The difference between 
forty children in a first-year class all sitting in their seats, 
holding readers, while one at a time rises and performs, 
and a group of ten or fifteen gathered about the teacher, each 
one reading frequently, while all are intent on the exercise, 
is the difference between solitude and society, because the 
pupils sitting in their seats are really isolated and not en- 
gaged in co-operative activity, while the group is a society 
working together. The difference is also the difference be- 
tween idleness and profitable.work. In the large class there 
are inevitably many vagrant minds, in the small group there 
need be none. 
But possibly of even greater consequence to the develop- 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 The School and Its Life 
ment of individual training is the work of the children in 
groups not “reciting.” The great lack of most of our 
Need for Schools is a lack of productive activity. Such 
Produc- activity is the chief essential to learning. The 
tive Ac- _ reactions possible while merely listening are in- 
tivity. significant compared with those manifested in 
doing. The education of children during the first five or 
six years of life, before they come to school, is so much more 
economical and effective than that in school largely because 
it is mainly through doing. 
Ideas received find expression at once. The games of 
childhood are in the main merely the giving of adequate 
expression to ideas received, so making knowledge real. 
There is no fake learning on the playground; there is much 
of it in school. 
The children in groups not reciting, if the school is well 
organized, are all doing something. It may be memorizing, 
which is commonly called studying. It may be really grasp- 
ing the thought from a book, but more commonly it will be 
expression or production, writing or drawing or painting 
to make clear a thought, constructing in plastic or solid 
material some object to illustrate an idea. In any case it 
is individual mental work, whose results are sure to show 
later in the recitation. 
Some form of productive work, whether with pen, pencil, 
brush, scissors and paper, or carpenter’s tools, is the indi- 
Productive vidual’s chance. It compels mental activity; it as-

the state of mind than the spoken words; though of course all 
these forms of reaction must be stimulated and utilized.
-P-A-G-E-53
  The Individual Child 45 
The motive of all such plans as the one outlined is to 
make sure that all the children’s minds are working, and 
not merely that of the teacher or of the single child who 
chances to be “reciting,” and this can be assured only when 
there is work that each necessarily does. 
In certain exercises, such as singing and writing, each 
child of necessity does his own work, whether there are 
two or two hundred, but in the greater number of school 
exercises this is not true. Hence the wise teacher will use 
every means to secure this individual activity. 
Such activity is necessary for the growth of individual 
minds even if they are all normal and evenly developed. 
But no school is composed of normal and evenly whattoDo 
developed minds. The variation is as great as with the 
the number of the individuals. Should the Abnormal. 
school take account of all these irregularities and treat each 
child independently, basing the course upon his state and 
his consequent needs? Is the school to be a pathological 
institution, each room a ward and each desk an invalid’s 
cot? No, of course not; common sense is as important in 
school as elsewhere, and the golden mean is always found 
between the extremes, even in pedagogics. 
Most children are so nearly normal that no wide departure 
from regular standards is needed to meet the requirements 
of their growth. Taste will usually display apti- >, 
tude or its lack, and in any fair and broad course Majority 
of study there is abundant opportunity to give Nearly 
individual taste considerable scope without dis- Rommel, 
turbing the regular order of things. This is particularly 
true if the children are grouped according to ability and 
attainment, and if there is much expressive and productive 
work. Every new expressive art added to the curriculum
-P-A-G-E-54
  46 The School and Its Life 
means just so much wider opportunity for the individual 
to develop along natural and characteristic lines. This is 
one of the chief values of manual training in its various 
forms, of music, art, productive language exercises, and, in 
the lower grades, of cutting, folding, cardboard construction, 
and sand-table illustration.

The permanently defective should, for their own good as 
well as for that of the school, be removed to some institution

school should be burdened with them. In all states there 
are institutions for their care.

The Recal- ability or unwillingness to fit into the existing

conduct in school, is often in childhood merely an excessive 
development of certain interests and aptitudes and a re- 
tarded development of certain perceptions and adjustments. 
Truancy is usually due to an excess of interest over vo- 
litional development or self-inhibition. 
The cure for many school vices is not punishment but 
the establishment of new interests, new relations, and new 
tendencies. The ungraded or individual school is often, 
under a strong and wise teacher, very successful in reaching 
such cases. Of course it is essential that the children should 
not regard it as a penal institution, and that is one reason for 
putting together the morally and the intellectually incapable. 
There still remain the few in every class who are not 
defective enough to be forcibly removed, but who are not 
able to do successfully the minimum of the work 
required. It would doubtless be better for these 
unfortunates if they could be taken from the over-full class- 
toom of the public school, where they are subjected to 
embarrassing comparisons with other children, and placed 
in small private schools with teachers who have more time 
to devote to them than the hard-worked public school teacher 
can possibly give. But with many this is impossible and the 
teacher must accept the burden and do his best. 
He must be patient and observant. The children must 
not be made unhappy because of natural defects. Almost 
all that can be done is to watch for evidences of interest and 
make the most of these. It may be necessary for these 
children to go over the work again, but not infrequently a The Dull.

new value may be put into their lives if they can find them- 
selves in some single line of activity or study. 
I recall an instance told of one such child, who from his 
fove for nature, first manifested in an interest in frogs, was 
led on until he became a fair student in other branches. 
Often some employment about the school can be given to 
such pupils, which will increase their sense of personal dig- 
nity and stimulate a certain amount of brain activity. 
Help them to self-possession and activity in every possible 
way, and then accept patiently the meager results, if pos- 
sible, without rendering the children unhappy over their 
meagerness. 
With the morally defective, not bad enough to be excluded, 
a similar course is necessary. The first thing to establish 
is an interest in something worth while; usually Tpe 
they need moral perspective and a sense of respon- Morally 
sibility. Proper and interesting employment will D¥- 
commonly cover the case. Often social duties for the school 
will impose the necessary sense of responsibility. I recall 
a principal who cured a bully by appointing him a sort of 
policeman to keep the big boys from bullying the little ones. 
Occupation is the key to life. Those well employed in 
things that interest them have comparatively little tempta- 
tion to mischief. “Satan finds some mischief still for idle 
hands to do.” Hands forcibly employed in work that does 
not appeal to their owner as worth while are equally ready 
for his Satanic majesty. 
I have not referred specifically to the exceptionally bright 
pupil because his case is simpler. If he is given, The Ex- 
in addition to the minimum of requirement, abun- ceptionally

50 The School and Its Life 
in each subject beyond the possible requirements of school, 
that there is surely enough employment for the most pre- 
cocious mind. 
Add to this the privilege of promotion to a higher grade 
whenever he is ready for it, and the bright pupil will not 
suffer, and will be in less danger of either one-sided de- 
velopment or priggishness than if taken out and coached 
as a genius. 
To summarize, each pupil should be given the best that 
his peculiar individuality requires. Teaching should always 
result in a reaction in each mind taught. School should 
be so organized as to make this inevitable. But the good 
of the individual requires for his education not solitude, but 
society.

CHAPTER VI 
DEPARTMENTAL TEACHING 
THE phrase “departmental teaching” has come to have a 
technical meaning as applied to elementary schools, so that 
most teachers readily understand it without further definition. 
It means the abandonment of a plan which has generally 
prevailed in the elementary schools of this country, under \y 
which the class-room teacher has given instruction to his 
class in all subjects required by the curriculum for the grade, 
and the substitution therefor of a system of special teachers 
who give instruction in their particular subjects to the pupils 
of several classes or grades. This is nothing less than the 
extension of the plan of the college down through the sec- 
ondary school, where it already largely prevails, into the 
elementary school. 
As to the limits of this extension in the elementary school, 
there is no unanimity of opinion among the advocates of 
the plan. Some would include within its sweep pigerences 
all of the grades above the very lowest primary. of Depart- 
Probably the greater number would stop with mental 
what are known generally as the higher grammar Te@ching. 
grades, that is, the highest two or three grades of the gram- 
mar school. In many private schools practically all of the 
instruction above the kindergarten grade is special, and a 
certain amount of specialization in public schools as far 
down as the fourth year of the school course is not unknown. 
5
-P-A-G-E-60
    52 The School and Its Life 
There is a wide difference of opinion among the advo- 
cates of departmental teaching as to the extent of this special- 
ization. Some would include all subjects; that is, would have 
special teachers of reading, special teachers of arithmetic, 
of geography, and so on through the entire curriculum. 
Others would have specialization only in those subjects that 
are supposed to be very difficult and to require higher tech- 
nical knowledge, such as geography and history, and others 
still would group the subjects according to some real or 
imaginary correlation. 
The machinery, too, by which the various plans are carried 
out differs in various places. In some a very highly de- 
AVariety veloped and fully organized scheme has been 
of Methods. worked out, and in others the very crudest arrange- 
ments exist. Sometimes the teachers move from class to 
class to teach their subjects to the pupils. Sometimes the 
pupils move from room to room where the teachers of the 
different subjects are located. In a number of places build- 
ings have been constructed especially for departmental work. 
The plan of these generally has been the grouping of small 
recitation rooms about large study rooms. But while there 
are all these differences in administration, the various advo- 
cates of departmental teaching agree in the main as to their 
reasons for favoring some plan of specialization in elemen- 
tary teaching. 
On the other hand, there are many teachers, and among 
Many them many of the most thoughtful, who are not 
Teachers greatly impressed with the advantages claimed for 
Opposed. departmental teaching, and insist that the time- 
honored and prevalent plan of the single class-room teacher 
is better. 
It is my aim here to state the principal arguments both
-P-A-G-E-61
  Departmental Teaching 53 
for and against departmental teaching, and to give my own 
conclusions and the reasons for them. The chief argument 
advanced by all friends of specialization is that _. 
thereby better teaching is secured; that the teacher eh 
who teaches a single subject is able to master it among 
and become really, or approximately, a scholar in Teachers 
his own particular field, which is practically im- pee a 
possible for the teacher who has to prepare daily 
for a great variety of subjects. A teacher of history, for 
instance, may become a thorough and exact student of his- 
tory, and may bring to the class an enthusiasm for the subject 
and a knowledge of its details which no class-room teacher, 
obliged to teach a dozen different subjects a day, can pos- 
sibly attain, and as a result the children are likely to have 
a wider and better view of the subject and a greater interest 
in it, and are more likely to become readers and students of 
history themselves afterward, because of their contact with 
an enthusiast and a scholar in the subject. This argument 
is applied to all of the different subjects of the curriculum, 
and with much apparent force. 
It is undoubtedly true that the teacher who teaches one 
subject only will secure, at least for a time, a greater interest 
in the subject, and will quite likely know more p.achers 
about it than the one who teaches several subjects. may 
As a sort of corollary to this, it is claimed that the Become 
subjects will be pursued with greater thoroughness. SPeci@lists. 
It isalso claimed that this plan furnishes an opportunity to the 
teachers to become specialists, — that is, to assume a higher 
professional position, and also to follow and develop their 
own aptitudes. It is taken for granted that in dividing up 
the corps of teachers of a school according to subjects, per- 
sonal tastes and personal ability will be considered, —that is,
-P-A-G-E-62
  54 The School and Its Life 
the teacher who is most fond of history and can teach it best 
will be likely to be given history rather than mathematics, 
and that this arrangement will encourage the teacher to 
become still further a specialist in his subject. 
It is also argued that the different subjects pursued

Systemati- Which is undoubtedly one of the greatest evils of cally. ; E our graded school system, will thus be avoided. 
The argument is just, and is one of the strongest in favor of 
a departmental system in the grades. 
A further argument is that departmental teaching brings 
the children into contact with a variety of minds at the same 
Children ime, which is broadening; that if a child is sub- 
Brought ject to the influence of only one teacher for a 
into Contact length of time, his mind becomes unduly influ- 
a enced by that of the teacher, if the teacher is a 
: strong one; and if the teacher happens to be a 
weak one there is no relief whatever from his bad influence. 
Doubtless this is a strong argument. The child who happens 
to be placed for a year in the class-room under an inferior 
teacher who teaches badly all the subjects is undoubtedly 
a sufferer, whereas it is scarcely to be supposed that all of 
the teachers of the different subjects in one year will be bad, 
and so the pupil under departmental teaching is sure to come 
under the influence of one or more good minds and to have 
any tendencies to one-sidedness removed by coming into 
contact with many men of many minds. 
As evidence of the force of all these arguments, their 
advocates point to the teachers of the college and high 
school, who are practically all specialists, where often great
-P-A-G-E-63
  Departmental Teaching 55 
enthusiasm is aroused in the individual subjects that they 
teach. This side of the question scarcely needs further 
elaboration, and may be summed up in a very few phrases: 
more highly specialized teachers, hence better teaching, 
greater thoroughness, and the broadening of the minds of 
the children by contact with the minds of various teachers. 
On the other hand, the advocates of the prevailing system 
of class-room instruction deny most of the claims of the 
friends of specialization, and while they admit some of the 
advantages, they claim that they are more than overbal- 
anced by the disadvantages. One of the most serious indict- 
ments of the departmental system is that it is destructive 
of the best qualities in teachers. This at first glance seems 
unreasonable, and it is certainly a direct contradiction of the 
claims of the advocates of the system. 
But let us consider it. The best teacher is not necessarily 
the one who knows the most about his subject, though of 
course a thorough knowledge is desirable. In penas to 
particular, the best teacher is not the one whose Make 
view of life is limited by his subject. A true Teachers 
knowledge of any subject involves all of its rela- N#*¥0W- 
tions. It cannot be denied by thoughtful observers that 
the continual teaching of one subject, and especially of one 
phase of one subject, for a series of years, is destructive 
of the best mental power. Even in colleges, where the 
higher and broader phases of the different subjects are taught, 
it is proverbial that the professor becomes in time narrow 
and out of touch with the world. If he is a real teacher he 
must consider his subject in its relations to the class. This 
of itself limits him to certain elementary phases. If this is 
true of the college teacher, it is emphatically true of the 
elementary teacher, who is dealing constantly with inferior 
   
-P-A-G-E-64
  56 The School and Its Life 
minds, and who must modify the subject-matter of his 
department so as to adapt it to infant digestion. He inevi- 
tably in time takes a small and narrow view of what he is 
teaching. There is nothing in his work to broaden him, 
nothing even to broaden his interest in his subject. He 
has to gather a certain limited amount of knowledge of a 
single subject into condensed and. palatable form and pre- 
sent this to children. This almost unavoidable effect of 
teaching a subject has never been more beautifully or piti- 
fully described than in Charles Lamb’s Schoolmaster.

difficult is it to keep alive the spirit of true manhood and the 
right kind of interest in life. I can conceive of few things 
more deadening to the higherintellectual life than the teaching 
of some one subject year after year and day after day to chil- 
dren. For the first year or two after the introduction of depart- 
mental teaching into schools there may be evidences of brighter 
work, but wait a few years until the deadening effect of the 
limited field has become evident in the teachers. First is 
sure to come a loss of interest in the subject-matter as taught, 
then a loss of interest in teaching. The same subject is 
gone over year by year, vastly more knowledge has been 
arrived at by the teacher than can possibly be used in 
teaching in elementary schools, and so he becomes a mere 
routine teacher, having nothing in his work to stimulate 
ambition.
-P-A-G-E-65
  Departmental Teaching a 
The corollary to this is a lack of breadth in the teaching. 
There may be a certain sort of narrow thoroughness, that 
is, certain details may be pursued to considerable lengths, 
but that kind of breadth which comes from relating the sub- 
ject continually to every phase of life is gradually dropped 
out as the teacher becomes more and more absorbed in the 
special phases of his limited field. There is nothing so 
precious in all our school systems as the spirit of professional 
zeal and pride in the teachers resulting in their constant 
growth, and consequently nothing can be more serious 
than such an arrangement as will of itself in time unavoid- 
ably kill this. 
We must not forget that proverbially the teacher of all 
grades is looked upon as ignorant of the world and is held 
in a sort of toleration and admiring contempt by i é Teachers 
the practical man of affairs. And we teachers o¢ Subjects 
must admit that this view is not altogether de- rather than 
void of justice. I have referred to the occasional Teachers - . . of Youth. ignorance and self-satisfaction of the average col- 
lege professor, and his frequent unfitness to deal with the 
problems of life. The complaint is quite general that the 
modern tendency toward specialization in colleges is making 
teachers of subjects rather than teachers of youth, and that 
the old-time college professor who was found here and 
there in all of the older colleges, — a man of broad culture, 
of many interests, able by the greatness of his personality to 
influence youth, is disappearing before the man who knows 
his Greek enclitic or his theory of curves perfectly. 
We must admit sadly that these strictures upon the 
teaching profession are more or less true, and that the most 
dangerous feature is the entire unconsciousness of this on 
the part of teachers themselves, — their complete and smug
-P-A-G-E-66
  58 The School and Its Life 
satisfaction with themselves and their limited field of 
knowledge. 
If this is so true of college professors as to be generally 
noticed, how sadly and emphatically true it would be of 
our elementary school teachers if they were to be limited 
in their work to the instruction of youth in the simplest rudi- 
ments of some one subject. Who would not rather have 
teachers teaching children, with many interests and a wide 
outlook, even if their knowledge of this or that subject is 
limited, than men or women who know their subjects, at 
least so much of them as it is necessary to know in order 
to teach young children thoroughly, but who lack the wide 
outlook which general culture gives? This argument is 
a plea for culture as opposed to special knowledge for gen- 
eral educative purposes even in college, but infinitely more 
in elementary schools. 
Another serious objection to departmental teaching is its 
interference with that correlation of school subjects which

with a cation. Not only theory, but experience, shows

subjects that they overlook the value of all-around develop- 
ment for the children. Each one pulls his own way and the 
strongest teacher gets the most work from the children, while 
they are likely to get an altogether one-sided and false view 
of the field of knowledge as it is presented to them. 
Take what view we may of the various schemes of correla- 
tion which have prevailed at different times in our school 
systems, all thoughtful teachers admit the importance of 
the recognition of the unity of life and the unity of knowledge 
in elementary teaching. The only reality is found in relation,  
-P-A-G-E-67
  
Departmental Teaching 59 
and this needs to be impressed upon children from the start. 
Especially such subjects as the language subjects need to 
be taught in connection with those which furnish the raw 
material. This becomes especially difficult under the depart- 
mental system. The teacher of language is likely to teach 
with sole regard to the formalities of speech, the rules of gram- 
mar, and that dead and deadening technique which has been 
fatal in our elementary schools. Instead of teaching language 
by its use for the expression of thought, stimulated by the 
other subjects of the curriculum, it is taught as a thing 
apart, with neither posterity nor offspring. The same objec- 
tion applies to those other subjects which are naturally re- 
lated in school as in life. Proper correlation in elementary 
schools is almost impossible under departmental teaching. 
There is a further argument against departmental teach- 
ing which relates to the pupils solely. The unity and the 
saneness of school life are in danger of being students 
destroyed by it. We must not forget Dr. John Need Per- 
Dewey’s often quoted dictum, “School is life, 
and it is much more important that its unity of interest, its 
unity of purpose, be kept before the children than that sub- 
jects be taught with extreme thoroughness. Each child in 
school needs to be personally conducted. Personal obser- 
vation of the children while studying, careful consideration 
of their various lines of ability, the adaptation of the curric- 
ulum fo the needs of each individual, are the most impor- 
tant duties of the teacher. Now if each child is moved 
about from one teacher to another, or is made the recipient 
of calls by teacher after teacher, this care is lost. No one 
looks after the child, — each one looks after his subject.

Need of ‘Phy, and so on through the list of teachers and 
Harmon- the list of subjects. There is no well-rounded

met places too much emphasis upon disconnected 
knowledge, and tends to substitute it for that growth of the 
spirit which is education, and for which during their earlier 
years children need not force-pumps of knowledge, but the 
careful nurture, the considerate and wise guidance, of a 
single, helpful teacher. 
The departmental system in other ways tends to remove 
to too great an extent the personal element from the relation

are the most critical time in his life —the time of the

ever, the counsel and guidance of a firm, strong, wise friend, 
and not the pulling and tugging of a number of people 
anxious to get him through as many pages of their respective 
subjects as possible. 
The complaint that children are overworked in the 
grammar grades often has force, considering the physical 
condition of the pupils at that time, but it gains more force 
if the work is departmental and the careful consideration 
of the class teacher is removed. 
There is also the confusion which comes from bringing  
-P-A-G-E-69
  Departmental Teaching 61 
pupils under the care of teachers having different standards. 
The good work of one teacher is often more than offset by 
the poor work of another, who happens to secure popularity 
because he makes his work easy. 
School life, like all life, is a unity, and in order to be 
most effective with children the unity needs to be kept 
constantly before their minds. Education is pgycation

than in the acquisition of facts in the different subjects; 
for how small a part of life facts such as may be taught in 
school are, and how great a part of life the ideals and tend- 
encies, the motives and aspirations, that may be planted 
in the upper grammar grades by the wise class teacher are! 
In view of the conflicting arguments for and against the 
departmental system of teaching, it may be well to consider 
whether a plan can be devised which shall retain pedanies

have been made which have met with reasonable ao 
success — enough to give hope that there is a way f 
out. It must be borne in mind that any such compromise 
must respect certain principles. 
First. A regular class-room teacher must have charge of 
the pupils of a room; must be familiar with all of Regular

secured in harmony with any degree of departmental work, 
the departmental work should be abandoned. 
Second. On the departmental side, any compromise arrange- 
ment should secure in certain important subjects continuity

yeets- Tt should secure to each teacher opportunity to 
devote particular attention to at least one subject — 
enough to become expert in it, and at the same time 
should offer a sufficiently wide field of work covering other 
subjects to avoid the narrowing effect of extreme special- 
ization. 
Can this be accomplished? Under wise supervision it 
probably can, and ultimately, perhaps generally, some such 
plan as the following may be found feasible. 
Let each teacher of a group, comprising classes of two 
or three consecutive years, select one subject, as broad as

so that the teacher who chooses arithmetic, for instance, will 
instruct the pupils of perhaps three grades in this subject, 
and will be able to follow their consecutive development 
in his own line of work. This would occupy a portion of 
each day. The rest of his time could be given to the pupils 
of his own class. Another teacher may choose history 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  
Departmental Teaching 63 
and teach that in like manner, in three or four grades or 
rooms. 
It is possible to imagine an arrangement of small groups 
of this sort, if the teachers are harmonious and if the work 
is carefully supervised, which will secure to the pupils expert 
instruction in some subjects and will retain for them the 
careful guidance of the class-room teacher in all their work; 
and which will, at the same time, give each teacher an 
opportunity to study thoroughly some one subject and be- 
come a scholar in it and an expert in teaching it, and at the 
same time, by teaching the greater part of the subjects in 
the class-room, to keep a wider interest in knowledge gen- 
erally and be able to correlate the different subjects. 
Carefully conducted trials in some places have shown 
also that a plan somewhat similar to this can be, with profit, 
extended to the first year, at least, of the high gimitar 
school. One of the great ‘problems of high school Plan Good 
teachers is the fitting of new students into the for High 
new life in such a way as to avoid undue dis- Senco: 
couragement and that fatality which takes sometimes more 
than half of the entire class before the end of the first year. 
This fatality is largely due to the sudden plunge into ex- 
treme departmental work. Pupils during the earlier years 
of adolescence are particularly in need of sympathetic and 
helpful guidance. This they have had in the ordinary gram- 
mar school. When they enter the high school and are put 
into the hands of specialists at once, with no one to look after 
them in particular, in very many cases complete discourage- 
ment follows and the pupils either fail or voluntarily leave 
the high school. 
If a modified departmental system can be employed in 
the grammar school, as has been outlined, it will help to

dreadful shock which too frequently accompanies this tran-

It is quite possible during the first year of the high school 
to have every student placed under the personal care of 
some teacher who shall teach him in more than one subject 
and shall be charged with the special duty of following him 
through his different lines of work and seeing where he needs 
help and guidance.

This should be done even if some expert knowledge is

It may be possible that by some such scheme as is here 
shown, beginning in the grammar grades and extending 
over the first year at least of the high school, an increase in 
definite scholarship on the part of teachers may be gained, 
and at the same time the individual pupils may be properly 
looked after — that is, that the advantages of the regular 
class-room system and of the departmental system may both 
be conserved and the disadvantages of both reduced to the 
lowest terms.

CHAPTER VII 
GRADATION AND PROMOTION OF PUPILS 
In every school system it is necessary to have some 
definite plan by which pupils may be properly classified 
and may be advanced from grade to grade according to 
their needs; it is necessary both on educational and on 
economic grounds. For economy’s sake the pupils must 
be distributed so that each teacher shall have a suitable 
number — that is, so that the classes shall be kept reason- 
ably full. On educational grounds the pupils must move 
along as rapidly as their growth demands, and must be 
associated with those of similar attainments. 
Upon what principle, or principles, should the rules regu- 
lating the promotion of pupils depend? There has been, 
and still is, a very wide variance in regard to promotion 
this matter in schools. There has been, more- by Exami- 
over, a great change in general sentiment, and also 2#t9- 
in custom, within the past few years. The plan that came 
in with the systematizing of schools was promotion by exam- 
ination alone. At stated times pupils weté all submitted 
to a formal examination on questions prepared by some one 
in authority, and they stood or fell according to the results 
of these examinations. 
In a public high school of considerable size that I once 
took charge of as principal I found this custom prevailing, 
and continued it until I learned better. The last week of 
66
-P-A-G-E-75
Gradation and Promotion of Pupils 67 
each school month was given up to review and written 
examination — that is, one fourth of all the time was so 
employed. As I remember, two or three days were spent 
in oral review and the remaining days in written examinations. 
These were rigid and mechanical in the extreme, and at 
the end of the year, or upon the completion of a subject, 
another examination was given and an average was struck, 
which determined absolutely and without any other con- 
sideration whether the pupils were to be promoted or not. I 
have no doubt that the principal who inaugurated this plan 
in this particular school, and who is now one of the most 
distinguished educational men in the country, has often 
laughed at his precision. But customs scarcely less harm- 
ful prevail now in spots. 
The examination fetich still has its worshipers, but in so 
far as I know, there are now comparatively few school sys- 
tems in which reliance is placed wholly upon examination 
in determining the promotion of pupils. 
THE RATIONALIA OF EXAMINATIONS 
Notwithstanding the general loss of respect for examina- 
tions as determining promotion, it would be difficult to 
conduct a scheme of education, whether for an individual 
or for a million individuals gathered into a system, which 
did not provide for examinations. 
An examination is a partial test of both knowledge and 
power. No examination can fully test either knowledge or 
power. As to the former, at most it can determine pxamina- 
whether certain specific facts have been acquired. tion Partial 
It cannot determine how much is known or how Test 
much is not known, so it is necessarily limited to the strictly 
conventional or to the specific things that are known to have
-P-A-G-E-76
  68 The School and Its Life 
been taught; and yet in those elementary phases of knowl- 
edge which are represented in all educational institutions 
there are certain fundamental and characteristic data which 
all should know who assume to have any knowledge of the 
subjects whatever, and a knowledge of these can, to a 
limited degree, be tested by an examination. But it must 
be borne in mind in all examinations that the examination 
shows only whether the specific questions asked have been 
correctly answered, and not whether other questions equally 
important might or might not have been answered. 
As to power, an examination may determine the ability 
of the student to do certain specific and technical things. 
But the field of activity is necessarily of the most limited, 
and very little can be ascertained as to the ability of the 
student to do those things that it is most important in life 
he should be able to do, and so we have the long line of 
great men whose college records, as determined by examina- 
tions, were most unsatisfactory, partly, perhaps, because the 
tests applied did not determine their real knowledge or 
power. 
And yet all schools must have examinations. Their 
chief value, however, is to the student and not to the teacher. 
Chief Value L2ey do not to any very great degree indicate 
of Exami- to the broad-minded and wise teacher any facts

the Pupil his possession, but they often do open the eyes Himself. ‘ . of the student to his own state to an extraordinary 
degree. It is good for us to be put up against ourselves 
and find out through bitter experience how much or how 
little we know and can do. So, frequent examinations of 
various sorts should be given: examinations in which the 
questions asked cover a wide range; easy examinations to  
-P-A-G-E-77
  Gradation and Promotion of Pupils 69 
see how much the student can tell about his specific sub- 
ject broadly stated; narrow and technical examinations to 
see how little he knows about certain phases of subjects; 
examinations moreover so difficult that only the best can 
pass them. But the promotion of no child should be based 
upon these examinations; they should be used solely for meta- 
physical and educational ends. Their only use in determin- 
ing the right of the student to promotion should be their 
indirect effect upon the minds of those who must decide 
the question of promotion; they are among the lights 
shed upon the case, not by any means always the most 
valuable. 
DAILY MARKING 
Another very common method of determining the question 
of promotion is that of the daily marking of the recitation. 
This is sometimes used independently and some- Daily 
times in connection with the examination. Of the Marking 
two it is by far the more deadly. Much better an Destroys 
the Reci- examination coming at times with carefully pre- ape 
pared questions than the fatal pencil suspended 
over the equally fatal note-book while the student is trying 
to say something that shall secure a good mark. With the 
daily marking system it is practically impossible for teachers 
to teach well or for students to recite well, because these 
both imply freedom, and neither teacher nor pupil can be 
free under this system. If the student is to be marked upon 
his answers to questions, of course the questions must be 
strictly categorical and capable of being answered correctly 
by him. The teacher may not stimulate thought and appeal 
to the imagination by asking questions outside the narrow field 
of the text-book, because if he does the student will be unable
-P-A-G-E-78
  7o The School and Its Life 
to answer them and must receive, consequently, a bad mark, 
and the students themselves will hold the teachers most 
rigidly to the categorical question under these conditions. 
Nor can the student indulge in any flights of imagination 
or investigation or ask questions betraying curiosity or igno- 
rance. He must know his questions and answers in order 
to get his marks. By combining the two, the daily marking 
of the recitation with the formal examination at regular 
intervals, you have a combination of the two worst con- 
ceivable methods, — two negatives that make a positive 
evil. 
THE PROPER TEST 
What, then, is the best test? First, let us answer another 
question. What is the motive of promotion? It has but one,

Where should be no element of punishment or reward in 
oo the promotion of students, — absolutely nothing 
"but a common-sense assignment to the best 
place for work. Teachers are sometimes influenced in their 
judgment and their markings by the conventional or un- 
conventional conduct of the pupil, by personal behavior 
or personal characteristics, and they have been known to 
refuse to promote pupils because “they did not deserve 
it,” that is, because they had been offensive or disagreeable 
or disorderly, or had not studied as hard as the teacher 
thought they should have studied. Such considerations 
have nothing to do with the case and cannot be intro- 
duced without injury. ‘Is John or Susan better fitted to 
do the work of grade one or of grade two?” is the only 
question. The time of a child’s education in school is
-P-A-G-E-79
Gradation and Promotion of Pupils 71 
limited, and to keep him back a half year or a year for 
any reason other than his own personal good is to com- 
mit a serious offense against him. To push him ahead, 
on the other hand, into places where he becomes lost and 
discouraged and is unable to do his best work, is equally an 
offense. 
Now, to return to the original question, “What is the 
proper test for promotion?” There is only one answer, —the 
fitness of the pupil for promotion is a matter of 4 Matter of 
judgment to be determined by those who are in Individual

A teacher, after associating with a child for a term of a 
half-year or a year, listening to his recitations and daily 
inspecting his work in the various subjects, should know 
whether that child is qualified to go ahead and do the work 
of the grade beyond ornot. The teacher’s judgment should 
be strengthened by all kinds of natural and artificial memory,

dents will do better under a spur such as is given by work 
a little beyond them, while others will be discouraged by 
such stimulation and will do better when the work appears 
light. 
All that is needed in determining whether students shall

judgment. Formal and mechanical tests are dangerous.

be even a matter of averages. Numerals, whether taken 
singly or in averages, are dangerous as applied to the needs 
and the laws of growth of the human mind. 
One thing should be borne in mind always, and it needs 
constant reiteration, —no consideration for the system as 
such should enter into the question of the promotion of 
pupils. The system has its claims; but promotion is an 
individual matter, and a single child whose case is under 
consideration is entitled to a judgment according to his needs, 
not according to the needs of his neighbors or of the system 
as a whole. The system that cannot stand the shock of 
proper consideration for individuals is an unworthy system. 
It should make no difference whether the student is ready 
for promotion at the middle of the term or the beginning of 
the term; he should be promoted whenever he is ready. It 
also should make no difference whether he is the only one in 
the class to be promoted or the only one not to be promoted; 
his individual good should be the only consideration in each 
case, and every other consideration which interferes with this 
should be sacrificed to it, even if some classes are unduly 
large and others unduly small. In such cases the remedy 
can easily be found in a new division of classes. 
It is better to have regular promotions frequently than 
to have them infrequently. Through all grades the regular
-P-A-G-E-81
  Gradation and Promotion of Pupils 73 
class promotions should occur not less frequently than semi- 
annually, and in the primary grades they should occur 
more often, as three or four times a year. From et fone 7 : Regular, 
this it is fair to infer that the regular class pro- Frequent 
motions are perfectly proper and should be main- Promo- 
tained. While every individual should receive all tions 
the consideration he needs, the exceptional indi- Desrables 
vidual is the one who most urgently demands special treat- 
ment. Probably three fourths of the children in every class 
will move along with sufficient uniformity to justify class 
promotions at regular intervals; possibly ninety per cent in 
many classes. It is the remaining tenth that is in danger 
of being submerged and lost. 
PROMOTION DEVICES 
This subject has been much agitated of late years, and 
most thinkers upon educational subjects, including the lead- 
ing superintendents, are opposed to the rigid Danger of 
classification of pupils, although unfortunately Nostrums. 
this is found in practice often where it has been discour- 
aged in theory. As a result of the agitation of the subject 
many people have come forward with nostrums for remedy- 
ing the evil, some of which have been widely heralded. 
Some of these are simply mechanical devices for doing 
away with the admitted evil. Others are based upon an 
eccentric philosophy of education and are radical and 
fundamental attempts to substitute extreme individualism 
for the social school, while still others provide machinery 
for affording to individual children new crutches in the 
form of advisory teachers, so that the weak may limp along 
faster and keep up with the more active. Most of these 
nostrums are composed of simples, some good and some 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
74 The School and Its Life 
bad, — that is, practically no one of the patent methods for 
removing the evils of rigid classification is without merit, 
but, so far as I have been able to examine them, they are all 
defective in that they are superficial, based upon a partial 
view of the educational field and exaggerating certain feat- 
ures. 
One very much advertised method makes so much of 
mechanical provisions for promoting individual students 
that it quite ignores the weightier educational questions 
involved and tends to inferior teaching, because the question 
of promotion is made the great question rather than a cor- 
ollary. Another method, also much heralded some years 
since, though now not so frequently heard of, is attractive 
in many ways, but based upon a dangerous philosophy, 
viz.: that the individual is to be educated without regard 
to his neighbors, thus ignoring the most important feature of 
education. Any system which attempts to do away with 
class recitation and to substitute individual work is a return, 
practically, to the unfortunate private tutor notion, and 
disregards the very valuable training which comes from 
co-operation and competition in the class. 
In regard to the third mentioned, — the furnishing of 
external individual help for students, —,there is extreme 
danger that the help so provided will lessen rather than in- 
crease the independent power of children; that self-reliance 
will be impaired, and while apparently rapid progress may 
be made through certain elementary grades, it is too much 
like the “stuffing” for examination, of which all disapprove. 
Hence it seems necessary to examine all special methods 
carefully before employing them. Nothing can take the 
place of education itself, which is growth. 
Many nostrums have been advocated for the training
-P-A-G-E-83
  Gradation and Promotion of Pupils 75 
of this or that mental power, and for the securing of some 
really admirable educational end, but each has ultimately 
either taken its place as one of the many departments of the 
general educational scheme, or has fallen into innocuous 
desuetude. So we come back to the conclusion that the 
only thing needed in determining the promotion of pupils 
in all grades is common-sense judgment, of course resting 
upon a rigid spinal column, and the sooner we can sweep 
away all diverting accessories, the sooner will the children 
receive their due. 
Notwithstanding all this, it is not safe to leave the pro- 
motion of children in a school system to chance. A plan 
must be carefully formulated by the superintendent and 
promulgated so that there may be uniformity of thought and 
method, though not uniformity of promotion. I beg to offer 
here a scheme which has worked well in some places, which 
might not work well in others, but which may at least be 
suggestive to the studious. 
A RATIONAL SCHEME 
In all grades, beginning with the fourth, at the end of 
each week teachers prepare, on blanks furnished for the 
purpose, an estimate of the work of each student during 
the week. These estimates represent the judgment of the 
teachers upon the ability and industry displayed by the pupils 
in the various subjects pursued. They are recorded by the 
use of the letters A and B, A being the passing mark, B in- 
dicating failure. 
At frequent intervals, brief examinations or written re- 
views of various sorts are givey the pupils in their respective 
classes, and a record of the results obtained in each case is 
kept by the teachers. Questions for at least one examina-
-P-A-G-E-84
  76 The School and Its Life 
tion in each semester are furnished or specially authorized 
by the superintendent of schools. The results of these 
examinations are not made the basis for promotion, but are 
used and considered by the teacher as a guide and critique 
for his own work, and as one means for determining the 
character of the work of the students. 
At the end of each month a report is sent to the parent 
or guardian of every pupil, giving the results of the weekly 
estimates taken from the teacher’s record, modified by the 
results of any written tests given during the month. Each 
of these reports, signed by the parent or guardian, is returned 
to the teacher. ‘ 
At the end of each semester, the teacher and principal 
together examine the record of each pupil, including both 
weekly estimates and all tests or examinations given during 
the term, taking into consideration also all circumstances, so 
far as known, affecting the work of the pupil. 
All pupils whose work has been found upon the whole 
satisfactory, and all who have given evidence that they are 
qualified to do the work of the succeeding grade, are pro- 
moted. Those whose work has been found to be in the 
main unsatisfactory, and who have not given satisfactory evi- 
dence of ability to do the work of the succeeding grade, are 
not promoted, provided that in the case of exceptional pupils 
conditional promotions for a definite time may be made. 
This is a résumé of rules already in force. It will be 
observed that there are regular but not daily markings by 
teachers, and these markings are not technical nor in figures; 
they are simply occasional records of the general character of 
the work done by the pupils to serve as aids to the memory. 
A record is also kept of all tests and written reviews, these, 
too, as aids to the memory. No one of them, nor all of them  
-P-A-G-E-85
  Gradation and Promotion of Pupils 77 
together, can be used technically and formally to determine 
promotion; they are all kept simply as aids to memory. Nor 
are they averaged. The average is a most dangerous device 
in this connection. Sometimes a poor record during the 
first part of the year may bring the average down to a point 
below passing, although good work done the latter part of 
the year may indicate a state of mind entirely fit for promo- 
tion; and the reverse may be true. The only object of the 
records is to prevent snap judgments upon the most recent 
effort of the student, be it good or bad. 
The number of marks used is also important. My own 
judgment is that there should be but two marks used, — 
one to indicate work of sufficiently good char- Two Marks 
acter to make it clear that the student ought to Enough. 
go ahead, and the other to indicate the opposite. Fine 
gradations are most difficult to make; they are a trial to 
the teacher, who never can make them accurately, and they 
are dangerous for the students. It is not necessary for 
the students to be ranked in comparison with one another. 
They will draw their own conclusions surely enough, and 
they need no artificial help to priggishness or to discourage- 
ment or bravado. 
There is a further danger in the use of marks to indi- 
cate exceptional merit or exceptional demerit. Students 
come to rely upon marks and to work for marks. Working 
Teachers sometimes fear that if special excellence for Marks. 
is not recognized students will not work as well, which is of 
itself a confession that their studying is from a wrong motive. 
Suppose students do work a little harder to get a mark, that 
work does not have upon them the right effect; it does not 
make them better students; it does not cultivate the habit of 
study; it does not even cultivate a love for study. On the
-P-A-G-E-86
78 The School and Its Life 
contrary, it acts to divert the mind from these very desira- 
ble ends. The child comes to think of this good mark 
rather than of the work itself. I would rather have good, 
average work based upon interest, than what the teacher 
might mark as superior work, resting back upon the de- 
sire for a mark. The former I would expect to see fol- 
lowed by good, average work later. The latter is very 
likely to be followed by a complete drop when the stimulus 
is removed. 
Moreover, as has already been said, the reliance upon 
marks is most dangerous morally; it tends to take the mind 
Moral from the real ends of life and turn it to inferior 
Danger of ends. It is impossible for us to conceive to how 
Secondary Jarge an extent the prevailing low standards of 
pas life, the love for money and secondary ends, are 
due to the sort of standards that have prevailed in our 
schools, and the stimuli presented to our young people while 
getting their training. How can we expect the boy or girl 
who has been urged all through his school days to work for 
a mark, or a prize, or to avoid a punishment — that is, for 
some secondary end —when he comes out into life, to grasp 
immediately the values of life and work for primary ends? 
Is it not the most natural thing that he should work for 
money, place, or something else which is secondary? The 
habit is formed in school and it simply accents the worst 
in our American life, and no amount of preaching afterward 
can prevail to break this habit. It seems to me that this 
reason alone is sufficient to deter us from offering secondary 
inducements to young people who are going through school. 
From the above it must be evident that in my judgment 
the fuss made over the promotion of students is entirely 
unwarranted by facts; that there is no need of great agitation
-P-A-G-E-87
  Gradation and Promotion of Pupils 79 
or upheaval, but simply of the application of the same sort ;* 
of common sense that is applied to any successful business 
enterprise; and further, that we need to get all of our school 
work away from the degrading influence of that excessive 
competition with which our whole social and business life 
is infected.

CHAPTER VIII 
~ THE PLACE OF THE TEACHER 
WE have discussed in the previous chapters the adminis- 
tration of the internal affairs of the school, the employments in 
which the children are engaged and the conduct of the pupils, 
what it should be, its underlying principles and the methods 
of securing it, all together constituting school life. The 
teacher has been taken for granted. It is now time to dis- 
cuss the teacher specifically, to determine just what is his 
place in the scheme of school organization and administra- 
tion and how he should conduct himself toward the system 
as a whole, and in particular toward his own class of pupils. 
THE TEACHER MAKES THE SCHOOL 
A school is a society. Its factors are the children and 
the teacher. Both are essential, but it is the latter that gives 
Schoola the society its peculiar, differentiating quality. 
Society. The one characteristic which distinguishes the 
school from other collections of people is the presence of 
the teacher. In more senses than the popular one it is the 
teacher who makes the school. 
The world is full of people who are educating themselves 
on consciously or unconsciously, who are utilizing all

-P-A-G-E-89
  The Place of the Teacher 81 
teachers. There is no school without a living teacher enter- 
ing, to some degree, into the lives of the pupils, forming 
some sort of spiritual union with them. It is as true in the 
practical sense as in the philosophical that the teacher is 
the school. 
SMOOTHING THE TEACHER’S PATH 
Every school administrator knows that his one serious 
business is to secure good teachers. Courses of study are 
important and a good school is more easily SC anne School 
cured with a good course of study than with a gystem to 
poor one. Proper organization is important; Make It 
good schoolhouses are important; good text- Easier to 
books are important and all the appliances which cag 
may be used to further education; but none of these 
alone nor all of them together constitute a school or can 
make a good school, and the good teacher can make a 
good school if any or all of these concomitants and aids 
are lacking. Hence it follows, since good teachers are 
not limited to any one locality, or produced at any one 
institution or by any one method of training alone, and 
good schools are found in all places, even under most un- 
favorakle circumstances and coming from the least promis- 
ing sources, that it becomes the chief duty of the executive 
authorities of school systems everywhere, first to secure 
the best possible teachers, and then to remove, in so far 
as possible, all obstructions from their paths, to give them 
free scope and to aid them in their work in every 
conceivable way. All the machinery of great school sys- 
tems, local, state, and national, has for its aim, properly, 
this one thing, to make it easier for the teacher to teach 
well.
-P-A-G-E-90
82 The School and Its Life 
SCOPE OF THE TEACHER’S INDIVIDUALITY 
In the small private school, in the rural school, and in 
most of the schools found in the earlier history of educa- 
Taine tion in this country, the teacher was all in all; 
Baral the teacher made the school; he was expected to 
School the make the school. If the school was good, it was 
ee is to his credit; if bad, it was his fault. The best 
* type of school depending wholly upon the teacher 
is the rural school. Here the interference with his work 
is very slight indeed; he is compelled to employ his own 
initiative, make his own plans, organize his institution, and 
execute his plans. Young teachers, coming from training 
institutions, are frequently urged to teach in rural schools 
for a while, in order to develop the power of initiative, of 
independent action, through their necessary exercise in the 
professional solitude of the country schoolhouse, — and it is 
good advice. 
Many of the strongest and best teachers and educational 
leaders that the country has ever known have received their

they began their discouraging work. Here they were re- 
quired to study their pupils and give them work suitable 
for them, to devise their own methods, to meet emergencies, 
often serious, quickly and firmly. In the country school 
that is good for anything, the teacher is “it.” Alas, that 
in any system of schools he should ever cease to be “it.” 
But there is, unfortunately, in the development of large 
institutions, a tendency to subordinate the individual, and
-P-A-G-E-91
The Place of the Teacher 83 
to destroy individuality. This is noticeably true in great 
school systems. It seems almost inevitable. The demands 
of the organization itself are so great, it requires so much 
executive power to keep the machine running, that the ma- 
chine itself attracts undue attention, and we are in danger 
of forgetting that the business of the school is to teach indi- 
vidual children, and not simply to move without friction as 
part of a machine. This worship of machines is the most 
debasing kind of fetich worship. It destroys the power to 
judge of values and, like all worship of inferior gods, it sub- 
ordinates the higher ends to the lower. 
TYRANNY OF MACHINES 
Too often in our great city systems, teachers are judged 
by their ability to run along smoothly in a well-oiled machine 
rather than by their power of inspiration, their Teachers 
ability to uplift, encourage, strengthen, and really Judged 
teach children. I have known teachers full of the fa 
love of youth, possessed of extraordinary inspi- { Run 
rational power and ability to make children think, with the 
work, and learn, driven from the school system Machine. 
because they did not readily untie red tape. We too often 
forget that the school system is useful only so far as it makes 
it easier for the teacher to teach, that every unnecessary bur- 
den, every extraneous demand upon the teacher’s energies, 
everything which distracts his mind or takes his thought 
away from the one purpose of his work, which is teaching 
the children, is a positive injury. 
One of the worst formsof machinedomination is that which 
places undue stress upon statistics and makes of the teacher 
a compiler of figures. Great marking schemes have been 
devised which prevent teachers from teaching with their 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
84 The School and Its Life 
whole souls; schemes for marking children upon all con- 
ceivable points, which require brain-racking study, burning 
of the midnight oil and, it must be confessed, even imagi- . 
nation, to an awful extent. 
The effect of this sort of thing upon the children has already 
been discussed (Chapter VII). The effect upon the teacher

Marking systems lead children to study for marks, to be-

as to be envious and hateful and narrowly exacting, so they 
lead teachers to teach for marks, to control for marks, to 
put the whole stress of their work upon the getting of marks, 
and even, too, sometimes to cheat for marks and to lie for 
marks. 
IMMORAL ORGANIZATION 
The evil of all this thing is easy to see. Any method of 
organization or of work that distracts the attention from 
Evil of the real end, and forces it upon a secondary end, 
Placing is immoral. As has been said repeatedly in this 
Stress upon book, the great evils in life result from placing 
a undue stress upon secondary ends; upon the 
: accumulation of wealth instead of the proper 
expenditure of wealth; upon acquiring power instead of 
upon the proper use of power; upon getting rather than 
giving. 
To force teachers continually to drill along narrow lines 
in order that marks may be secured is to take away their 
spiritual freedom and to degrade them. The teacher who 
is forever harassed lest his pupils shall not pass, naturally 
is unable to give his whole attention to the needs of the chil- 
dren and to the satisfying of those needs.
-P-A-G-E-93
The Place of the Teacher 85 
The teacher of the rural school, if of the right sort, studies 
John and William and Susan, and decides that for John’s 
good he should do this; William, for his good, cpijgren 
should do that; and Susan, for her good, should Al Treated 
do something else; but the machine-made, ma- Alike. 
chine-driven teacher, in a system having no such freedom 
of action, treats John and William and Susan all alike — 
they must all take the same brimstone and treacle be- 
cause it is good for somebody —and is not allowed to 
exercise his own judgment or follow his interest in their 
spiritual well-being. This is not only bad for the children 
but is, if possible, worse for the teacher. They may recover, 
because their school days fortunately end some time; the 
teacher’s fate becomes fixed, as his school days never 
end. 
THE MARKING OF TEACHERS 
Another evil which is finding its way into our larger cities 
is the arbitrary and excessive marking of the teachers them- 
selves. The supervising force at times seems to qerrorizing 
regard it as its chief function, not to instruct, the 
inspire, and help the teachers, but to mark them. Teacher. 
I have known supervisors to go about from schoolroom to 
schoolroom, note-book and pencil in hand, sitting for a 
while in each room like malignant sphinxes, eyeing the 
frightened teacher, who in his terror does everything wrong, 
and then marking him in a doomsday book. (Such super- 
visors’ paths, like those of reckless automobilists, are strewn 
with the dead bodies of hopes, and ambitions, and nerves.) 
The excuse given is that some teachers will do wrong and 
hence a system of espionage and terrorism is extended, like 
the clouds of heaven, over all alike. This, of course, instead
-P-A-G-E-94
86 The School and Its Life 
of correcting the evil, increases it and creates new ones 
undreamed of before. 
Any system of supervision that tends to impair the 
Rinvairi self-respect of the teacher, to weaken his sense impairing oy oye ° . : the of responsibility to his own conscience, to belittle 
Teacher’s his office, and especially to humble him in the 
le eyes of his pupils, is vicious in the extreme. Respect. at Better no system than such a system, and this is 
a danger to be guarded against in all great systems. 
NEED AND DANGERS OF ORGANIZATION 
The origin of these evils is easy to find. As population 
becomes congested and schools multiply, ordinary economy 
Organiza- equires unification, condensation, and division of 
tion labor. Schools must be grouped and graded, that 
Necessary. js, children who are approximately equal in power 
and in attainments must be put together and placed in the 
charge of teachers who are adapted to their conditions. It 
becomes impossible for a single teacher to carry a single child 
through a long course of instruction. Schools must be so 
organized that the child can pass from teacher to teacher 
without undue loss or friction. 
The course of school education should be continuous and 
without shocks, hence, as systems grow, increasingly closer 
organization is necessary; over each group of teachers must 
be placed a head to see that the organization is maintained, 
that each one does his part, that the children move along 
from class to class as their growth requires without setback 
or loss. As communities become still larger there must 
be many of these groups of schools with their teachers and 
children. These must be organized so that the children 
may pass from one to another without loss, and there must  
-P-A-G-E-95
The Place of the Teacher 87 
be heads over these larger groups. So a complete organ- 
ization grows up in the course of time, planned superficially 
somewhat after the manner of an army with a principal 
officer and the necessary subordinate officers of various 
grades. These officers, endowed with large power, easily 
come to consider it their chief vocation to keep the machine 
running, until in time the machine itself is so magnified in 
their sight as to appear of chief consequence. So the educa- 
tion of the child, for which the machine was created, is too 
frequently subordinated to the running of the machine 
itself; that is, we too frequently forget that the school officers 
and the school machine itself exist but for one purpose, to 
help the teachers teach, and that when they cease to do that 
they have ceased to have a right to exist. 
IMPORTANCE OF THE TEACHER 
The most precious possession of a school system, rightly 
viewed, is the teacher’s devotion to his work. Any plan of 
organization, any method of administration or supervision 
which lessens that, and diverts the teacher’s energy into any 
foreign channel, is an evil. In the office of every superin- 
tendent and in the note-book of every supervisor should be 
written, the teacher is the school, and the daily inquiry of 
every such officer should be, “ How can I stimulate in all 
the teachers under my supervision love for their work, self- 
respect, a feeling of independence, and an ambition to do 
better teaching than ever before or than anybody else has 
done?”
-P-A-G-E-96
CHAPTER IX 
THE FREEDOM OF THE TEACHER 
THE school system is but an assemblage of schools, that 
is, of classes of children with their teachers so organized as 
to raise to the maximum the efficiency of each teacher; that 
at least is the theory. 
The great essential to real efficiency is freedom. I do 
not mean by freedom license or even liberty to do as one 
pleases, but the ability and the possibility to direct one’s 
energies with intelligence and purpose to the highest results. 
Such freedom is primarily internal rather than external, 
and for the teacher it begins far back of the organization, 
Freedom far back even of the act of teaching. The first 
Primarily steps in freedom must be taken by the individual. 
Internal. The teacher must be free from ignorance, from 
prejudice, from undue pride, from the debasing pressure of 
false ambition, from unwillingness to learn or to be guided; 
that is, the teacher must have a free soul-in_the Pauline 
sense. That is primary. Now suppose such a teacher has 
been elected to a position in a school system; this internal 
freedom must be preserved, and added to it must be a certain 
amount of external freedom, freedom to exercise native 
and acquired powers without undue restraint or perversion. 
THE FREEDOM OF CO-OPERATION 
There is a higher freedom than that of the individual 
in solitude. It is the freedom which comes from association 
83
-P-A-G-E-97
The Freedom of the Teacher 89 
and co-operation. An individual who has become an intelli- 
gent and conscious member of society, contributing of his 
best freely to the common good, is free to draw Society 
upon the community for a vast increment of Offers 
power. The individual who has become a co- Higher 
ordinate member of a free community is enor- Freedom. 
mously magnified, is a vastly larger being than the same 
individual in solitude. The society becomes his larger self 
through which he can do greater things than when alone; 
by its protection and help he has become free from innumer- 
able trammels and hindrances with which alone he was 
unable to cope. A true society is a great instrument of 
freedom through which each one is able to render far 
greater service than when alone; but when society arbitrarily 
checks the exercise of individual power, unduly restrains 
individual initiative, seeks to turn all the energies of each 
member into a single channel made by a single directing 
mind, then there comes a distinct loss of freedom and the 
individual dwindles. 
- 
POSSIBILITIES OF URBAN SCHOOLS 
It ought to be possible in a school system for each teacher 
to do much better work than a rural school-teacher can do, 
because while contributing his part to the gen- >. yrpan 
eral stock of knowledge and skill and inspiration, Teacher 
he can draw without limit upon that accumulated should be 
stock himself. Each teacher can learn from Bétter- 
the other teachers, for wisdom is communicable. If the 
heads of the system are wise and possessed of inspirational 
force, the teacher can add to his power from their wisdom 
and inspiration. The system properly conducted substi- 
tutes co-operation and common interests for isolation and 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
go The School and Its Life 
individual interests. The urban teacher should be a very 
much larger and wiser and better teacher than the rural 
teacher. In some instances this is the case. Our greatest 
teachers are not country school-teachers but city school- 
teachers, because it is possible in an urban system to become 
greater; there are more aids, more stimuli, more nutriment 
: available. But the teacher may avail himself Supervis- 
ing Officers Of these only when the method and plan of organ- 
the Largest ization and supervision make it possible; when 
one the school board and school superintendent and 
pare supervisors consider it their part primarily to con- 
tribute the largest share of inspiration and wisdom to the 
common stock, and secondarily to act as distributors of this 
common stock to the teaching forces. 
Let us briefly recapitulate the doctrine of the freedom of 
the teacher here advocated, lest any infer from what has 
been said a destructive radicalism subversive of order and 
proper administration. 
~ True freedom has its seat within the individual and con- 
sists in a proper adjustment of personal tastes, abilities, and 
aspirations to conditions and obligations, and particularly 
to social conditions. No one is truly free who is wholly 
selfish; who is ignorant; who is prejudiced; who is self- 
sufficient or inconsiderate of the views, the needs, the knowl- 
edge of others. 
Anarchy is not a phase of freedom; it is its antipode. In 
many respects submission to absolute authority is nearer free- 
dom than either completeisolation or anarchy. Life in society 
necessitates the consideration of all for each and each for all. 
The general good becomes paramount and must be so recog- 
nized. Indeed each individual attains his freedom only when 
he thus recognizes the superior claim of the social whole.

dom is not in the end, which in both cases is the common 
good, but in the fact that in the one case submission to the 
general weal is forced upon the individual; in the other it 
is voluntarily and with purpose yielded. In order to make 
the devotion of each individual to the general good effective, 
there must be co-ordination, centralization of authority, 
and organization. Without these there is enormous waste. 
The individuals, however well meaning, get in one another’s 
way; some needs are over-supplied; others are neglected. 
Thus in an ideal social state — granted even individual 
perfection — government, central power, recognized by all 
the individuals and controlling to a degree their conduct, 
is necessary; how much more in a very imperfect: social 
state, with individuals of all shades and degrees of fitness 
for society. 
The secret and the value of democracy are found, not in 
the absence of law or government, but rather in the utiliza- 
tion for common ends of all the powers of the different indi- 
viduals freely contributed, which results in the education, 
that is, in the growth of the individuals. 
Benevolent autocracy with even an absolutely perfect 
ruler would fail to develop the highest character in its sub- 
jects because it would fail to share responsibility. 
The evolution of society is the result of individual efforts, 
under stress of circumstances, to ameliorate’con- The 
ditions. The chief value of such efforts is the Progress of 
growth in power and freedom of those who make es

immediate external result, but education, is the product of 
moral and social struggle, and this education is the one 
sufficient reward for such struggle. 
Apply all this to the school. It is certainly necessary 
to have school officers with power, and with responsibilities 
consistent with such power. A school superintendent must 
have authority, and must have responsibility for the work 
done under him. The same is true of the school principal, 
but it is also true of the teacher. Unquestionably, unsatis- 
factory results would be produced if in a city school system 
there were no central power, and every individual were free 
to carry out his own law or his own whim. The result of 
such a condition would be somewhat akin to anarchy. At 
least there would be enormous waste, and countless children 
would suffer from crude and ill-digested experimentation. 
Much power should be bestowed upon the school super- 
intendent and his subordinate officers, such as supervisors

Wisely. Grganize school systems in such a way as to lessen 
the power of the superintendent and of the other officials. 
The great need is not an overturning of government, but 
the proper exercise of authority by those possessing it. A 
superintendent without authority would be weak indeed. A 
superintendent who thinks that knowledge will die with 
him, or who is afraid that his authority will be lessened if 
some one else shares responsibility with him, is a foolish 
superintendent. — 
The fundamental principle of democracy, that of educa- 
tion through responsibility, is essential for successful admin- 
istration in schools.  
-P-A-G-E-101
  The Freedom of the Teacher 93 
The sum of all the knowledge and all the power of all 
the teaching force is certainly greater than that of the ablest 
superintendent, and the wise superintendent will so organize 
his forces as to utilize this cumulative power and this com- 
bined wisdom. He will endeavor to stimulate in his teachers 
that true freedom which is within, and he will bestow the 
other freedom, which is also necessary, freedom for each 
teacher to do his best. Of necessity there will be negation. 
Some things will necessarily be forbidden, but, as in dealing 
with children, there will be only so much negation as is 
requisite for success, and there will be every encouragement 
to free activity. Teachers will be stimulated to study, to 
visit, to see new things, to devise new plans, and to put them 
into execution; first, for the sake of testing them, and after- 
wards, if they are proven worthy, as permanent features of 
their work. Teachers will be held responsible for results 
more than for methods, though methods that have already 
been proven vicious or dangerous will, of course, be forbidden. 
The teacher of to-day who should advocate the method of 
Dr. Rainsford’s teacher in Ireland fifty years ago, namely, 
kicking the pupil on the shins for every mistake, would 
certainly need some negation, as abundant experience has 
proven such a method not desirable; and when teachers

being, is dangerous and, if carried to ‘extremes, would be 
absolutely subversive of good schools.
-P-A-G-E-102
  94 The School and Its Life 
Yet the fact remains that the great business of the adminis- 
trative officers of a school system is to develop strong teachers, 
and a proper freedom. The large freedom of society, which 
develops each individual to the utmost and utilizes each for 
all and all for each, is as essential to the good teacher as to 
the good citizen. 
There is one form of bondage, unfortunately not unknown 
among teachers and school officers, against which a word of 
caution may not be amiss. I refer to the incurring of obli- 
gations toward powers either political or commercial in 
return for which some compensation is sure to be expected. 
The worst form of political bondage comes through actual 
bribery, the payment in money or a more valuable medium 
for an appointment. Recent developments have shown 
that such bribery is not uncommon in some sections of the 
country, members of city school boards and rural school di- 
rectors both stooping to take money from the teachers for 
their appointments. 
This does not need discussion. The mere mention of it 
is sufficiently painful. 
But there are certain other entangling alliances much 
more subtle in their nature, but frequently even more dis- 
astrous in their results. Often they are at first entered into 
innocently enough. I refer to the seeking and accepting of 
valuable favors, not only from politicians, but also from 
corporations doing business with schools. 
Teachers do well to remember that there is no philan- 
thropy*behind the rendering of such aid. A return favor 
is always expected. 
We have unfortunately every now and then the pitiful 
spectacle of teachers, school superintendents, and even uni- 
versity presidents, controlled by commercial corporations,   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-103
The Freedom of the Teacher 95 
whose motive is to gain prestige and influence and ulti- 
mately to sell their wares. It is not uncommon to hear the 
representatives of such concerns openly boast of their con- 
trol of this or that “prominent educator.” 
As I have said, these alliances have usually begun through 
the acceptance of aid innocently enough. But a teacher 
once in the toils finds it almost impossible ever to recover 
freedom without the sacrifice of position or reputation. 
Teachers who desire freedom should be extremely cautious 
in accepting favors from those who may want compensation 
at some time. There is no slavery worse than that of politi- 
cal or corrupt commercial domination. It is useless to plead 
for the freedom of the teachers until they free themselves 
from such forms of bondage.

RS CHAPTER X 
Tue DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEACHER 
As has been said, the sole function of a school system is 
to secure better teaching through improving the individual 
teachers and making it not only possible but easier for them 
to do their best work.) The system which does not accom- 
plish these ends, however carefully organized and skilfully 
managed it may be, fails to justify its existence, and a system 
which in even a slight degree impairs the quality of the 
teaching done is a nuisance and a menace. 
FREEDOM — HOW CONSERVED

-P-A-G-E-105
  
The Development of the Teacher 97 
which throws light upon the educational problem, is impor- 
tant and must be secured through the teachers if at all. 
But there are many kinds of information secured through 
the compiling of figures which are of no value to any one, 
or at least not of sufficient value to justify the saérifice of 
time and effort required to secure them. 
The passion for statistics which dominates some school 
superintendents is a dangerous one and easily runs into 
statistical dissipation. Many of the elaborate systems of 
keeping records of individual pupils are not only needless, 
but are a positive injury to both pupils and teachers. (See 
Chapters VII and VIII.) 
My second answer to the negative question is: Avoid 
every device or method of organization which tends to lessen 
the teacher’s individuality and sense of personal responsi- 
bility to the children. 
The teacher in the schoolroom should always feel that 
his first duty is to ascertain and meet the needs of the indi- 
vidual children under his care. In the machine p,,.¢ Duty 
system the tendency is to center the thought of toMeet the 
the teacher not upon the children, but upon the Needs of 
higher authorities, so that, instead of feeling re- Co 
sponsible to them and being anxious.to serve them, he be- 
comes over-anxious to “stand in with” the administration 
and sacrifices his own obligation to the higher law, to the 
demands of his superior officers for uniformity. This shift- 
ing of conscience is not only encouraged, but is almost ne- 
cessitated by some prevalent systems of administration. In 
particular does the excessive marking of teachers aceording’ 
to arbitrary standards, referred to in Chapter VIII, en- a8 
courage this transfer of allegiance. 
When a teacher is made to feel that he is in school not

Must Obey. as he might be. This doesnot mean that a 
teacher must not obey the school board and the school super- 
intendent. The teacher must obey, but if by any action of 
the authorities undue stress is laid upon the teacher’s rela- 
tions to them, belittling the importance of his relations to 
the pupils, evil surely follows. 
The task of correcting this evil rests, of necessity, with 
the authorities. It is true that a very good teacher, even 
under a martinet superintendent and a mechanical system, 
can do much toward bringing about right relations with 
his pupils and toward keeping the machine in its proper 
subordinate place. But the average teacher cannot do this 
and simply falls in with the manifest requirements of the 
system. If the stress is placed upon the machine side of 
the work, — the relations of the teacher to the officials, — 
and if the children are not kept prominently to the fore by 
the powers that be, the teachers will very soon transfer all 
their allegiance to these same powers. 
It is for the school superintendent primarily to keep con- 
stantly before the teachers the relative importance of their 
ane relations with the children on the one side, and 
Authorities the school authorities on the other. “He must con-

from the children to the machine, are removed. 
But there is a positive side to this question. A school

is to lead the teachers to respect themselves, to feel that they 
are trusted, and in return to secure their confidence. This 
done, it is possible to put into effect definite plans for help- 
ing the teachers and developing their freedom. 
The plans most commonly and most effectively employed 
for this end fall into four general classes: The course of 
study, meetings with teachers, class-room visitation, and 
private conferences. These we will consider in the follow- 
ing chapters.

CHAPTER XI 
THE CoursE oF STUDY 
THE course of study offers the most definite and the most 
effective means of helping teachers to efficiency and freedom. 
In a system of schools a course of study is necessary. 
Course This is beyond question. To allow each teacher

the teacher’s success and disastrous to the children. 
A course of study of the right kind brings unity and co- 
ordination into the schools and is indeed the chief unifying 
Minutely force. Of necessity, it prescribes that certain sub- 
Mandatory jects shall be taught throughout the system, and 
Course that in each grade certain phases of these: sub- 
Pate jects shall be taught, corresponding to the de- 
velopment of the children. Some courses of study are not 
ameans to the freedom of the teacher, but represent tyranny 
of thought and method. One kind of bad course of study 
is the minutely mandatory, which prescribes in detail what 
is to be taught each month and each week and each day, 
and imposes a uniform method for teaching each subject, 
leaving the teacher nothing to do but obey orders. 
Such courses are not uncommon, unfortunately. Where 
they exist the most serious effect is seen in the teachers, — 
who soon cease to try to exercise judgment and become 
inert and helpless. It is said that the squirrels in the 
too

parks have become so accustomed to being fed that they 
have entirely given up the frugal habits of their wood life, 
and no longer lay up stores of nuts for the winter; Weakens 
hence, if the winter is hard and the supply from Teachers. 
visitors insufficient, the park authorities are compelled to 
feed the lazy little animals. I have more than once seen 
teachers in school systems as helpless intellectually as these 
squirrels are physically, and for like reasons. Their work 
has been prescribed to such a degree that they have ceased 
to exercise judgment. When given general instructions as 
to the accomplishment of certain results, but without detail 
of method, they have been hopelessly and pitifully at sea. 
I have also seen these same teachers after a season of free- 
dom, in which they have been compelled to exercise their best 
abilities for definite, rational ends, grow greatly in strength 
and effectiveness, throw off the inertia and helplessness inci- 
dent to machine work, and become strong and serviceable. 
A course of study, then, should be broad in its outlines 
and suggestive rather than mandatory as to details and 
methods. It should require results, but these re- gnoutd be 
sults should be stated in large rather than in Broad and 
small terms. They should be results of growth Suggestive. 
manifested in power to do new things, rather than ability te 
answer a few stereotyped questions. 
The great fault of many systems of examinations is that 
the work required is so small and petty and minute that 
it belittles the teachers. Teachers become accustomed to 
drilling for the pitifully narrow questions asked in the 
examinations till they actually lose the power to think for 
themselves and to consider the needs of the children. The 
last thing that is present in their minds when planning their 
work is the development of the pupils. The imminent need
-P-A-G-E-110
  102 The School and Its Life 
is to qualify them to answer a few specific questions and 
get their marks. 
Further, a course of study should stimulate teachers to 
self-improvement. One of the claims made against teachers 
Rania as a body, especially in discussions of that utterly 
Stimulate {utile question, “Is teaching a profession?” is 
Teachers that they are not scholarly. After much observa- 
to Self-Im- tion I am convinced that the defect, in so far as 
See it exists, is due chiefly to the lack of impulse 
towards self-improvement in most of our formal school sys- 
tems. A teacher going over the work of a grade soon ac- 
quires mastery of the few insignificant facts that must be 
imparted to the children, and is able each year to do the 
required work with less effort. Very few of us keep up a 
high degree of intellectual activity without some stimulus 
outside of ourselves, so these teachers, finding it possible to 
do their work, keep a respectable position among their asso- 
ciates, hold their places, and draw their pay, often settle into 
a condition of intellectual coma. It is always most offensive 
and saddening to hear flippant talk about old teachers, 
especially women; but it must be admitted that there are 
enough of the narrow, unscholarly, and unstudious among 
them to give some excuse for raillery, and these are the 
teachers, almost without exception, found in mechanical 
systems, whose work is exactly laid out for them, who re- 
ceive from their superiors no stimulus to the exercise of 
originality and to broad, thorough investigation. The work 
in the schoolroom does not require study, except of a very 
meager sort; the administration does not welcome ideas, and 
the teacher naturally follows the line of least resistance. 
Hence, a course of study should necessitate much and 
continuous application on the part of the feucheg a should 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
The Course of Study 103 
not be too specific; it should allow room for the exercise of 
imagination and of originality; it should make necessary 
two definite kinds of study — one technically educational 
or paideutic; the other cultural. That this may be the effect, 
a course of study must be based upon educational principles. 
It must not represent a mere haphazard putting together 
of detailed instruction regarding the conventional subjects 
of school curricula, but rather it must be an orderly and 
philosophical presentation of the body of knowledge and 
the range of activities necessary for the proper education 
of the children. 
A course should not be so superficial that it can be under- 
stood without study. It is good to make it necessary for 
teachers to study the curriculum and then to study gj. 
educational principles in order to understand it. Require 
This is in itself broadening and strengthening Study for

more thoughtful and the brighter, wide fields of : 
inquiry and fine stimuli for growth. 
The second line of study which curricula should make 
necessary for the teachers is cultural. We all know that 
other things being equal the best teacher is the Should 
one who knows the most, and we also know that Require 
teachers knowing very little can get along fairly Study for 
well teaching children what is required by a very General . 2 . Culture. common kind of course of study. So true is this, 
that school authorities sometimes actually insist that knowl- 
edge is quite unimportant for teachers of little children; that 
ignorant teachers can do about as well as the more 
scholarly in the lower grades. 
A course of study should require of all teachers consider- 
able knowledge. It should stimulate them to the acquisition
-P-A-G-E-112
104 The School and Its Life 
of knowledge in many lines. One of the arguments some- 
times advanced against the introduction of nature study 
and other new branches into the grammar school course 
is that teachers do not know enough to teach them. One 
of the chief advantages of the introduction of such studies, 
the enriching of the curriculum, as President Eliot calls it, is 
that it makes students of the teachers. The effort which 
they make to qualify themselves to teach the new subjects 
is in itself cultivating, and it is fair to say that usually it is 
reasonably successful; but, better yet, they not only have 
more specific knowledge upon the subjects to be taught, but 
the windows of their minds are opened to a larger world. 
They begin to get the scholarly taste, to love study. I have 
seen many young teachers possessed of little professional 
ambition and little real knowledge grow into fine teachers 
of considerable scholarship and even culture, through the 
stimulating power of a broad and rich course of study. 
INTERPRETATION OF THE COURSE OF STUDY 
The course of study usually needs interpretation and 
comment. Left uninterpreted, in its printed form, its use- 
Requires fulness will necessarily be very limited. Some 
Interpre- teachers will read it and interpret it correctly;

will read only portions of it, those in particular relating to 
their own grades; and some will scarcely read it at all. 
The various methods resorted to for the fuller interpre-

Syllabus a the teachers as to its administration, are of two 
ee general kinds — written or printed syllabi, and 
E meetings of various sorts. The syllabi are merely 
expansions of the course of study itself. If the course is at
-P-A-G-E-113
  The Course of Study 105 
all elaborate in design, and especially if it is suggestive 
rather than restrictive, such syllabi are quite necessary. 
They usually take the form of discussions as to the teach- 
ing of the different subjects in the curriculum, and if clear 
and explanatory, are very useful. 
There is the danger, however, in large systems that some 
of the several supervisors will think that the superintend- 
ent’s course of study is too liberal and will attempt in syllabi 
to restrict it and to give in minute detail instructions for 
carrying it out.. This is a danger easily avoided, however, 
if the superintendent is alert. 
Little needs to be said upon the subject of syllabi except 
that usually they should be in the nature of commentaries 
rather than positive and definite instruction as to details. 
This, however, is necessarily a matter of judgment, and in 
some school systems, particularly after the adoption of anew 
course of study or after a change of administration, it is wise 
to make the earlier syllabi quite specific in order to avoid, as 
far as possible, all floundering and loose, aimless experi- 
mentation such as one sometimes sees in school. Such 
syllabi, however, should be followed at the earliest possible 
moment by others which are expository and deal with 
principles. 
The general rule might be laid down here that all instruc- 
tion to teachers, whether given in meetings or : . . : . Instruction through syllabi, should deal with educational prin- 1 Teachers

CHAPTER XII 
TEACHERS’ MEETINGS 
THE most common instrument of the supervising force 
for training teachers without destroying their freedom is the 
teachers’ meeting. Of these meetings there are many sorts, 
varying in their degrees of usefulness. The particular kinds 
of meetings that should be employed in any locality must 
be determined by local conditions. No general law can be 
laid down on this point, but the general principle may be 
emphasized that all meetings for teachers should be educa- 
tional, and it is surprising how the educational principles 
that we insist upon for the training of children apply in the 
training of teachers, and also how generally they are dis- 
regarded. The following are the various kinds of meetings 
in common use: 
General or mass meetings. 
Grade meetings. 
Meetings of teachers of adjacent grades. 
Subject meetings. 
Round table meetings. 
Classes for definite instruction. 
These meetings vary as to the constitution of the audience 
and as to the instructors. Let us discuss in detail a few 
of the more important ones. 
106
-P-A-G-E-115
Teachers’ Meetings 107 
THE GENERAL MEETING 
Every school system should have a few general meetings 
during the year, but only a few. They should be wholly 
meetings for stimulation and inspiration. Usually, general 
they should be addressed by the superintendent or Meetings 
some of the supervisors, or by some person of for Inspi- 
ability in a special line, not connected with the **#2- 
local school system, who can put the teachers into touch with 
prevailing educational thought, — with the world beyond the 
local field. 
The interests of teachers and their needs are so various that 
the general meeting can supply only a very limited amount of 
the help needed, only that which all teachers of all grades need 
incommon. It is of great value for teachers once in a while 
to be brought into the presence of a vigorous thinker, particu- 
larly if he belongs to a different school of thought from that 
dominating the school system. Such meetings tend to make 
broader and better teachers, but they do not supply the need 
for specific instruction which is necessarily felt by all good 
teachers, for it must be borne in mind that the only teachers 
who do not feel the need of assistance are the poor ones. 
GRADE MEETINGS 
Perhaps the most useful of all the classes of meetings is 
the grade meeting well conducted. The teachers 
of a single grade have very specific and common i 4 
needs, and it is easy for the conductor to meet for ue 
these needs. Meetings may be conducted by the cussion of 
superintendent or by the supervisors, or by teachers aoe 
of special subjects. If the meetings are short, as ; 
those held after school must be, it is usually well to devote the
-P-A-G-E-116
108 The School and Its Life 
time to the consideration of some one subject as taught in a 
particular grade. Whenever possible, the teachers themselves 
should take part in the discussion, to make known both their 
needs and their prevailing views. Talking to teachers is 
quite frequently talking in the dark. The speaker neces- 
sarily assumes a state of mind in his audience. If he assumes 
the wrong state of mind, then his talk is largely wasted. The 
supervisor and the superintendent talking to teachers in 
grade meetings should have an advantage over most speakers, 
in that they are supposed to know the conditions which they 
must meet; but frequently this is not the case. Meetings 
so conducted as to encourage free expression on the part of 
the teachers — especially on the part of those who are sup- 
posed to be a discordant element, out of harmony with the 
views of the administration — are apt to be very helpful meet- 
ings. Any supervisor should be glad of an expression of 
adverse opinion. If his views are sound he ought to be able 
to defend them in debate. No one has all the truth, and a 
comparison of opinions usually results in a nearer approach 
to it than any individual alone can attain. 
A very helpful plan is to have a class taught in the presence 
of the teachers at the meeting. This is more easily done 
Exemplary in the lower grades than in the higher, because 
Classes the children are less likely to be conscious, and 
Helpful. are more likely to act naturally. If possible, 
such a class should be conducted by a good teacher who is 
in accord with the educational theories of the superintend- 
ent, and it should show good work and normal work. The 
class should not be drilled beforehand so as to make a good 
appearance, but should do the kind of work that is ordinarily 
done by it in the school. After the lesson is over and the 
class dismissed, there should be a very full and free discussion
-P-A-G-E-117
  Teachers’ Meetings 109 
of the methods employed. The teacher who conducted 
the class and the presiding officer should be ready to an- 
swer all questions, explain all methods, and make clear any 
reason for anything done that was not made clear by the 
presentation itself. This is a most excellent plan for explain- 
ing a course of study, — the concrete is so much more easily 
comprehended than the abstract. 
Every superintendent must at times wonder if he has 
lost the power of using the English language. Instructions 
and explanations, given in what seems to him at the time the 
simplest and most lucid language, are interpreted in so many 
ways. We approach almost all subjects with a prejudice. 
It is practically impossible for a mind to be absolutely open, 
so that words produce very different effects upon different 
minds. Language is at best a very imperfect medium for 
the expression of thought, and we necessarily interpret that 
which we see and hear according to our own state of mind 
and our preconceived notions. A failure to recognize this 
fact is largely responsible for wide differences of opinion, 
for so-called heresy, for religious persecution, and often 
for war. Teachers are not exceptional in this respect, 
and I have often seen the most absurd construction put 
upon courses of study and have been held responsible for 
the most foolish educational practice, which had never 
even occurred to me as possible, because of the false 
interpretation of the printed course of study. The teachers’ 
meeting in which the class has been presented has often 
served to clear up these clouds and send the teachers 
away with a better understanding of the whole scheme of 
work. 
It might be said in passing that another excellent way to 
accomplish this result is to send teachers who do not under-

stand to visit those who do, that they may see the work 
going on regularly in the class-room. I recall the horror

Teachers. children, but just as soon as a few of the 
brighter teachers comprehended the value of such illus- 
tration, and the practical results of the employment of 
motor activities, there were centers for the diffusion of 
knowledge. The tables showing the illustrations of his- 
torical stories and geographical phenomena were brought 
before grade meetings and explained. Other teachers were 
encouraged to visit those who were using these tools 
intelligently, and in a very short time the entire miscon- 
ception passed away and the majority of the teachers 
had a fairly clear notion of the use of constructive 
work for illustrative purposes. It would have taken years 
of ordinary talking and writing to accomplish the same 
result. 
The work of the grade meeting should be specific and 
clear, one thing at a time being made plain. The teachers 
should go away feeling helped and stimulated. If the 
average teacher goes away from a meeting bored, there has 
been something wrong with the meeting. Superintendents 
and supervisors conducting meetings need to be especially 
careful to avoid tedium. It is so easy to become enamored 
of the sound of our own voices that we hold helpless bodies 
of teachers in bondage, as the teachers themselves hold help- 
less bodies of children, while we enjoy ourselves in talking. 
The talkative superintendent or supervisor is the béte noire 
of the profession.
-P-A-G-E-119
  Teachers’ Meetings IIl 
The teachers should always go away from a meeting feel- 
ing not discouraged, but stimulated and strength- d Teachers ened. Scolding a body of teachers for poor work oy ould Go 
may make them resentful and blue, but it will not from the 
secure the best work. We all need positive and Meeting 
cheering stimulation rather than fault-finding. A en oe 
new and alluring idea is worth a dozen destruc- 
tive criticisms, for securing the best work possible by a body 
of teachers. 
THE SUBJECT MEETING 
A very valuable kind of meeting is the “subject meet- 
ing,” that is, a meeting for the discussion of some particular 
subject in the curriculum. This meeting should 
be for the discussion of the principles under- ee 2 udy Sub- 
lying the teaching of the subject as a whole, and jects as 
should not be confined to particular grades. For Pursued in 
instance, it is a good thing to gather a group of San 
teachers teaching geography in different grades 
and to discuss the principles of the subject fully as applied 
to them. One of the dangers of a graded system of schools 
is the narrowing of teachers. Teachers who give instruc- 
tion to children of a single grade very soon learn the rig- 
marole of the course and usually fall into the routine and 
cease active intellectual effort. Their views are likely to 
be limited to the imparting of a small section of knowledge 
to children of approximately the same attainments. Now, 
it stands to reason that no teacher can do the best work in 
any grade, who does not have a comprehensive view of the 
scope of the subject. A teacher who is to teach geography 
to a third-grade class needs to have, not merely a knowledge 
of what is taught in the third grade, but a broad view of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  112 The School and Its Life 
subject of geography as a whole, its educational and prac- 
tical value, the principles that underlie instruction in it, and 
then to apply these to that portion of the subject-matter 
assigned to this grade. The teacher who knows merely the 
work of the grade and has no comprehensive view of the 
subject is like the mechanic who drives rivets and knows 
nothing of the machine upon which he is working. The 
difference is that between the artist and the artisan. 
THE MEETING OF ADJACENT GRADES 
Another kind of meeting, with partially the same object, is 
the meeting of teachers of adjacent grades. The fourth- 
Mecinps of grade teachers, for instance, should meet occasion- 
Teachers of ally with the third-grade teachers and occasionally 
Adjacent with the fifth-grade teachers. They should “look 
Grades. before and after.” They should know the general 
characteristics of children who are coming to them, and, in 
particular, the kind of training they are receiving, and they 
should know, also, what is expected in the next grade, so 
that their work may fit into the general scheme and be most 
useful. Such meetings are especially important for teachers 
of the higher grades. Teachers, in particular, of the highest 
grammar grades and the lower high school grades should 
meet at not infrequent intervals for a discussion of their 
common interests. One of the great troubles that the school 
superintendent has to meet and adjust is the continual com- 
plaint of the teachers of the higher grades that the teachers 
of the grade below have not properly done their work and 
that the children come from them unprepared. This often is 
due merely to difference in standard and a failure to com- 
prehend the preparation that has been given. Such com- 
plaint is particularly common when pupils pass from one
-P-A-G-E-121
  Teachers’ Meetings 113 
institution to another, as from the grammar school to the 
high school, and from the high school to the college, and it 
portrays, more than anything else, ignorance on the part of 
the high school teachers and of the college teachers of what 
has been done. The emphasis has been put upon what has 
not been done, and little effort has been made to discover 
the other. If the teachers could be brought together, a mutual 
understanding could easily be effected and much friction 
and much loss to the children be saved. 
At these meetings, sometimes, it is well to discuss par- 
ticular subjects, as, for instance, English; at other times, to 
discuss the general character of the pupils promoted, the 
teachers of the higher grades telling frankly the defects 
which they discover in pupils who have come to them, and 
the teachers in the lower grades telling what they have done 
for the children who are to come and what may be ex- 
pected from them. The value of such meetings needs no 
full discussion, but its recognition is not common enough. 
SPECIAL CLASSES 
It oftens becomes necessary for supervisors and teachers 
of special subjects to give specific instruction to teachers in 
these subjects. Sometimes all the instruction that Special 
is needed can be given in the grade meeting. Classes 
Sometimes this is insufficient. Some teachers, for the 
for instance, cannot teach music or cannot teach Dee 
drawing, and are a constant source of annoyance. What 
shall be done with them? Shall they be excused from at- 
tempting to teach these subjects, or shall they go on and 
teach them badly? Neither seems very desirable. I have 
found that classes conducted by competent supervisors have 
been most helpful, and usually all that has been needed has 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  114 The School and Its Life 
been to offer such classes for voluntary attendance. The 
teachers have been distressed by their inability to do their 
work and have gladly availed themselves of the opportunity 
to improve. Sometimes it has become necessary to insist 
upon a particularly weak teacher, who was particularly self- 
satisfied, attending these special meetings. Such meetings, 
naturally, may be held in the afternoon, sometimes, even, 
in the evening, because the teachers realize that they are 
getting, simply for the effort of attending, valuable instruc- 
tion in some important art. 
MEETINGS OF PRINCIPALS WITH THEIR TEACHERS 
Meetings of this kind should be held regularly, and not 
infrequently, for various purposes. For instance, that the 
teachers of the school may become acquainted with one 
another; that they may know the work of the grades above 
and below; that there may be unity and harmony in the 
general scheme of the school; that individual and trouble- 
some cases may be discussed, and that advice or instruction 
from the supervising authorities may be expounded. It is 
also well for principals, if the schools are not too large, to 
take up some specific study with their teachers, something 
of either general cultural value or professional cultural value. 
Circumstances will determine which is better. In most 
cases a book of professional cultural value — some work on 
psychology or educational principles — makes the best sub- 
ject for such study. 
MEETINGS WITH ASSISTANTS 
The need for meetings is not limited to the teachers. The 
superintendent should conduct meetings of his immediate 
assistants or supervisors. These meetings necessarily are for
-P-A-G-E-123
  
Teachers’ Meetings 115 
the discussion of general plans of work and to make sure of 
the existence of harmony in the administrative force. 
MEETINGS OF SUPERINTENDENT AND PRINCIPALS 
Meetings of superintendents and principals, however, are 
perhaps more than any others the key to the educational 
situation. They give the superintendent an opportunity 
to impress himself upon the leading minds engaged in actual 
school work. The time devoted to these meetings is precious 
and should not be spent in the idle discussion of minor 
details. Sometimes it becomes necessary for the superin- 
tendent to take time in a meeting to explain some admin- 
istrative regulation, or some matter of comparatively small 
consequence, but the danger is that all the time will be 
taken up in this way. It is usually much better to send out 
written or printed instructions as to these matters of detail, 
and to devote the time of teachers’ meetings to educational 
discussion. 
It is well to take up with the principals the course of study 
and to discuss its underlying thought, its philosophy, its 
educational aim. If these meetings can be upon superin- 
the “round-table” plan of general discussion, it tendent 
is very much better. Of all meetings these should cu 
be the freest, and the principals should be en- principles 
couraged to tell what they think. The superin- with 
tendent should not attempt to do all of the Principals. 
talking. The topic having been announced in the call or 
earlier, it is well to have some principal lead the discussion 
and others follow. The superintendent presiding should 
put in a word here and there if necessary in order to keep 
the discussion in the right line, and he should usually close 
it with asummary. At such meetings all kinds of subjects 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  
  116 The School and Its Life 
may be discussed which relate to the work of the schools; 
sometimes a particular topic, such as arithmetic or gram- 
mar; sometimes a question of method; sometimes a new 
book, or a new theory in education, such as the value of 
motor activities; but these meetings should be especially 
educational and should tend to bring about theoretical and 
actual harmony in the educational system. I count this one

ideas and their administration, he has won the day. And 
if his ideas will not stand a fair discussion in a body of 
reasonably intelligent principals, it will probably be well for 
him to revise them. 
In general, voluntary meetings for study are better than 
required meetings, but in most systems it is necessary to 
have many of the meetings with compulsory Organiza- : . : 
tion in attendance. It is to be borne in mind that what 
ae I have said here as applied to the city system would 
ities. need a slight modification if the system is very 
large and divided into districts. In such a city as Chicago, 
Philadelphia, or New York, for instance, the various kinds 
of meetings which I have described should be conducted in 
each of the districts, the district superintendent and his 
assistants taking the place of the general superintendent 
and his associates. In such systems, however, the general 
superintendent should try to exert a similar influence upon 
the body of district superintendents, and should also meet 
occasionally in mass meeting the principals of the city. No 
city is too large to admit of this.
-P-A-G-E-125
  Teachers’ Meetings 117 
TIME OF MEETING 
Now as to the time of conducting these meetings. Com- 
monly they are held after school or on Saturdays. After 
school the teachers are physically and intellec- yo oinos 
tually fagged and are not in condition to get the after a 
best from the teachers’ meeting. Doubtless School 
sometimes it is absolutely necessary to hold meet- oe 
ings at this time, especially meetings of principals : 
with their teachers and meetings for special instruction. On 
Saturday the teachers are not so tired, but Saturday is the 
teachers’ holiday. They, especially those of the gentler sex, 
want to go shopping or have mending to do, and they be- 
grudge the morning given to teachers’ meetings. They are 
apt to come in not the best frame of mind and to go away 
without the best results. 
It is a generally accepted principle in most of the states 
that institutes may be conducted for several days in each 
year during school time, the schools being closed and the 
teachers required to attend. This is a perfectly sound prin- 
ciple, and in all cases where the institutes are well conducted 
the schools are, in the end, the gainers; but this principle 
has not been applied generally in cities having their own 
systems for the instruction of teachers. The same prin- 
ciple should apply there. The important teachers’ meeting 
should be held during school hours, when the teachers are 
fresh and consider themselves on duty, the schools being 
dismissed for that purpose. 
THE GRADE INSTITUTE 
A very effective and a most useful system of grade meet- 
ings is as follows: The schools of a single grade, as the first
-P-A-G-E-126
  118 The School and Its Life 
or eighth, are dismissed for the day. The teachers assemble 
in a central place and are given a solid day’s hard work. 
All-Day The day may be divided imto four periods — two 
Meetings in the morning and two in the afternoon — varying 
of Grades. the work. One period, for instance, may be taken 
by the superintendent in the discussion of history; one by the 
supervisor of music for his particular subject; one by the 
supervisor of drawing for his subject; and the fourth by 
the superintendent, or a supervisor, upon some other theme. 
Taking one day a week and one grade at a time, it is 
possible, easily, to get around the grades of a system four 
times a year, thus giving four full days of instruction to all 
teachers. 
More can be accomplished in these four days of instruc- 
tion than in any number of after-school meetings or Saturday 
morning meetings. The plan is heartily commended by 
those who have tried it. It is necessary, of course, to edu- 
cate boards of education to an appreciation of the value of 
such meetings so that they will consent to the closing of the 
schools. It is really but a form of. institute, and as such 
falls regularly under the laws of most states. 
THE INSTITUTE 
It may be well in this connection to add a few words about 
the Teachers’ Institute, conducted under state or county 
auspices. This institute is quite general throughout the 
country. In its design and in its possibilities it is most be- 
neficent. In some states, and in some counties in other 
states, it fulfils its function well. Unfortunately, however, 
in too many places institutes are conducted in violation of 
many of the principles here laid down for the conduct of 
teachers’ meetings.
-P-A-G-E-127
  Teachers’, Meetings 11g 
The Teachers’ Institute is a serious business affair. It 
is supported by the state in order that the teachers may be 
made better. It is quite necessary that some such Institutes 
arrangement exist; if for nothing else, to insure Important. 
normal progress in educational principles and methods. 
Even if all the teachers of the country were graduates of 
normal schools, well versed in the principles of their pro- 
fession before undertaking to teach, it would still be neces- 
sary to have these institutes for the sake of brightening the 
teachers up, of presenting to them new thoughts and plans, 
and of keeping them abreast of the world. 
Hence the institute should be primarily and chiefly pro- 
fessional. The most common form of institute is that which 
keeps the teachers of all grades together for the ghoula 
greater part of the week and offers lectures or be Pro- 
addresses to them en masse. This is open to fessional. 
serious criticism. The best institute combines in proper 
proportions the general lecture and specific instruction. 
The former should be upon a high cultural and professional 
plane. The latter should be definite and adapted Divided in- 
to specific needs. In order that this may be the to Classes. 
case, it is necessary to divide the teachers of the institute 
into classes according to their grades of work. 
The mass institute has resulted in the development of a 
peculiar type, — the professional institute lecturer, who has 
become little more than an entertainer. The Dangers 
entertainment feature has come to predominate of Mass 
over the professional, so that in some places it is Tstitutes. 
practically impossible to secure attention for an address 
that is professional. The institute entertainer has learned 
what is expected of him and goes about with a bag full of 
quips, destructive as the winds of Solus, and if by any
-P-A-G-E-128
  120 The School and Its Life 
chance a new lecturer has not provided himself with such 
a bag, he is at once tabooed. 
A simple classification for county institutes is this: The 
tural teachers from the ungraded schools constitute one 
class. Their needs are quite uniform and can easily be 
met by the instructor who is familiar with rural schools. 
The teachers of the graded schools should be divided accord- 
ing to grades, into as many classes as their numbers and the 
number of the instructors admit, and instructors provided 
who are familiar with the specific needs of the different 
grades. Not oftener than once a day during the institute 
there should be a general meeting addressed by some speaker 
who is able to talk profitably to large masses of people, but 
the address should be both professional and cultural and 
not to any considerable degree for the sake of entertaining. 
It is true that a certain amount of social gain is received 
by the teachers from the entertainment features of these 
institutes, but that is not what they are held for and should 
be kept in the background. 
The usual county institute occupies the greater part of 
a week. Commonly the authorites, feeling that they must 
Not Many put the time all in profitably, arrange for three 
Meetings sessions a day, and sometimes for extras. Dur- 
ina Day. ing these three sessions in the ordinary institute, 
the teachers sit and listen, or have the appearance of listen- 
ing, to speakers. The result is what might be expected. 
After the first day, and also after the first session of each 
day, a manifest lethargy settles over the audience so that the 
speakers who come late find it very difficult indeed to hold 
their auditors at all. 
This occupying of the time is not a measure of economy but 
is one of waste. A very much better plan is to have but two
-P-A-G-E-129
  Teachers’ Meetings 121 
formal sessions,— a morning and an evening one — the 
morning session to be divided into periods, not more than 
three, of not more than an hour in length each. During 
these periods the different classes or divisions of teachers can 
be given technical instruction in three subjects by as many 
specialists. During the evening it is well to have a general 
lecture by some one inspiring talker before the teachers as a 
body. The afternoon may well be given up to excursions 
and the many social opportunities which mean much in the 
life of the average teacher, especially from rural districts. 
If county superintendents, who usually have charge of 
these institutes, would have the courage of their convictions 
and plan their institutes upon a basis as liberal as_ this, 
they would soon find that the increased interest and inten- 
sity of attention would much more than make up for the 
apparent loss of time. The many meetings give the institute 
an element of mental dissipation, which, like all other forms 
of dissipation, is dangerous. 
Continual listening without that reaction necessary to 
complete the circle of learning is dissipating for teachers 
as well as for children. Hence, as many as pos- peaction 
sible of the section meetings at least should be Necessary 
open for discussion by the teachers. In this to Learn- 
way the instructors would find out the mental and “® 
professional status of their auditors, and their needs, and 
the teachers themselves roused to voluntary activity would 
profit vastly more than when they simply sit decorously and 
listen. In teaching teachers in institutes we should not 
violate the principles of teaching that we are seeking to 
inculcate.

CHAPTER XIII 
THE VISITATION OF THE SCHOOL 
VisiTING schools is a universally recognized function of 
supervising officers of whatever grade. They all do it, 
but not all in the same way or the same spirit. Indeed, 
the quality of a supervisor may be pretty accurately gauged 
by the character of his visits to the schoolroom. These 
visits naturally will vary in character according to their pur- 
pose, but they should seldom vary in spirit, which should 
always be one of cheer and helpfulness. 
The two common and manifest motives of visitation are 
to ascertain what is being done and to aid the teacher. The 
Motives of former is sure to be prominent in the teacher’s 
Visitation mind, the latter should be in the visitor’s; and 
to Observe ultimately the teachers should come to welcome 
en ue the visits of the supervising officials as likely to 
Ps bring help and inspiration. 
Of course the visitor must observe, even critically, and 
must be able to judge the teacher’s work as a result, but 
this does not need to be made conspicuous. If it is, it is 
sure to defeat its own ends and bring about an abnormal 
state in both children and teacher which renders the obser- 
vation valueless. 
What is this teacher doing? What does he need? What 
can I do to help him? These questions should be written 
in the conscience of every official visiting schools. 
122
-P-A-G-E-131
  The Visitation of the School 123 
THE MANNER OF THE VISIT 
The visitor should be governed by common sense. No 
definite rules can be laid down. The character of the visit 
should be governed by its circumstances. But usually the 
visitor should step in quietly so as not to rouse or 
disturb the pupils, should greet the teacher cour- ppoule Ge on Friendly 
teously and, if there is opportunity without dis- Terms with 
turbing an exercise, should engage him in a brief Teacher 
but bright conversation to put him at his ease, — 
and then should become absorbed in what is going 
on, as an interested and kindly observer, and not a cold and 
distant critic. Especially he should avoid all appearance 
of being a spy or looking for occasion to find fault. He 
should get on friendly terms with both teacher and children 
and should enter into the spirit of what they are doing so 
that his interest is manifest to them. This will restore the 
equilibrium and bring about natural conditions. 
Perhaps the chief thing to observe is the spirit of the 
school, its atmosphere, that psychological and social con- 
dition which grows out of the relations existing, Observe the 
the motive and spirit of the work, in short, the Spirit of 
life of the school, which is its real educative force. the School. 
This is, of course, intangible and invisible, but it can be 
spiritually discerned; only, however, by one who enters into 
it sympathetically, not by one who looks on coldly, ready 
to find fault upon the slightest pretext. 
The method of the recitation will necessarily be observed, 
and this observation will include the attitude of the 9 orve the 
children toward the teacher and toward the work; Method of 
whether the knowledge is clear and definite or the Recita- z : tion. vague and misleading; whether the answers are "°™ \
-P-A-G-E-132
124 The School and Its Life 
categorical and bookish, or free and suggestive of enlarged 
interests; whether the teacher places the greater emphasis 
upon a few exact statements or upon wider interests; whether 
the children are the more eager to learn or to tell. These 
and other well-known tests will be silently applied. 
The observer will also note the children at their seats, 
Observe the how they are conducting themselves, how they 
Children at are employed; whether they are absorbed in their 
TheirSeats. work or easily diverted by chance occurrences; 
whether they are pursuing subjects earnestly or merely 
memorizing. 
But the spirit of the school includes all this. The careful 
observer will see whether the physical conditions of the 
school are the best obtainable, whether the temperature is 
normal, the lighting right, the seats of suitable size and 
arrangement. 
These and other things are taken in by the visitor while 
he is apparently wholly occupied with the work presented. 
That is, he must learn to see without looking; because too 
conspicuous observation of metaphysical conditions disturbs 
them. 
HELPING THE TEACHER 
Having seen and felt the conditions of the school, how is 
the visitor to help the teacher? 
Little can be done at the time: a word of encouragement, a 
bit of praise, a suggestive question, an inspiring or stimulat- 
ing remark, all aptly dropped in such a way as not to disturb 
the order of things. If there occurs an intermission or a brief 
interval between classes, a pleasant and helpful little conver- 
sation may be wedged in. All should be done naturally and 
easily, so that when the visit is over the teacher is sorry 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  The Visitation of the School 125 
and will look forward with pleasant anticipation to the 
next one. 
Of course sometimes it may be well for a supervisor to 
take a class and give a lesson to illustrate some particular 
point, but never to show how much better he can do it than 
the teacher. The teacher should never be humiliated be- 
fore the class by suggestion, criticism, or even example. 
Noisy and boisterous visitations should be avoided. I 
have seen visits which reminded me of the Pharisee of old 
who had a trumpet blown before him, only in this visitor 
case the visitor blew his own trumpet, as if to say, should 
“Behold, children, how great a man am I. I be Quiet. 
condescend to speak to your teacher. Is it not noble?” 
In many instances nothing further is needed than can be 
done during the visit. But sometimes much more is required. 
If the teacher is doing badly and needs severe criticism, 
if he is discouraged and needs brightening, if the work is 
especially original and suggestive and merits further con- 
sideration and development—under these and other special 
conditions the visit should be followed by the private con- 
ference either at the school or at the office of the visitor.
-P-A-G-E-134
CHAPTER XIV 
THE PRIVATE CONFERENCE 
Tuis means of helping teachers and improving the work 
of the schools is not used enough; we deal too exclusively 
with teachers in masses. 
Naturally one of the most helpful features of the school 
organization is some degree of personal acquaintance between 
Personal _ the officials and the teachers. While this is easier 
Contact to secure in a small system than in a large one, 
with it is entirely possible in even the biggest system. 
Teachers. However large the system, supervising officials 
should be so distributed that at least some of them may come 
into personal contact with all the teachers and know their am- 
bitions and aims, and their merits as well as their faults and 
weaknesses, and may give the sort of inspiration and strength 
which is given only in personal contact. Any system that 
is so organized as to faik to secure this personal contact 
between the teachers Of the class-rooms and the officials 
who are to direct them and pass upon them, in so far fails 
to do its duty, and this applies equally to systems large and 
small. The personal, sympathetic intercourse of those who 
know more with those who know less, of the stronger direct- 
ing minds with the directed minds which need help, is the 
sine qua non of good school administration. 
All serious criticism of teachers should be in private and, 
except in cases that are manifestly and absolutely hopeless, 
126 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  
The Private Conference 127 
should be positive and suggestive rather than negative and 
condemnatory. More teachers can be stimulated to good 
work by helpful and kindly suggestions than by criticism of 
merely pointing out faults. Yet faults must be Teachers 
pointed out, and early. Superintendents are should be 
often timid about private conferences and allow # Private. 
teachers to go on in wrong courses rather than perform the 
disagreeable task of criticising. This is not kind, and teach- 
ers who fail ultimately because of these faults may with rea- 
son say, “Why did you not tell me?” 
The teacher should go away from such a conference en- 
couraged rather than discouraged. Indeed a conference of 
the right sort would often remove discourage- peachers 
ment. Many a discouraged young teacher whose should be 
school has become a dreadful burden, and who Encour- 
goes home tired in body and mind to spend an Bee: 
anxious and sometimes a tearful night, could be saved all 
this distress if a sympathetic principal or supervisor were 
to spend a half hour in private conference with her, bring- 
ing the results of his experience and his superior wisdom 
to the reinforcement of her limited skill and experience. 
It is always a good plan to talk things over sympathetically 
and frankly with the weak teacher. Of course the private 
conference may be killing, but it should not be; it is en- 
tirely possible to point out faults and at the same time to 
point out remedies in such a way as to give encouragement 
rather than discouragement, and this is one of the chief 
functions of the supervising officer. A hint, a simple sugges- 
tion of some new plan, the stimulating of a new interest, the 
giving of a new point of view, accompanied by kindly 
interest and encouragement, will frequently make a good 
teacher of a poor one.
-P-A-G-E-136
  128 The School and Its Life 
It should never be forgotten that the purpose of class- 
room visitation and its consequent conference is that of all 
school organization, to help the teachers teach, not to dis- 
play the greatness of the official, not merely to inform him of 
conditions, but to encourage, to uplift, to inspire, in short, to 
help the teachers teach. 
In all efforts to help the teachers, through meetings, class- 
room visitation or private conference, our principle applies. 
Encouragement, praise when possible, evidence of confi- 
dence, suggestion and inspiration — all positive forces — are 
worth vastly more than fault-finding criticism, even if astute, 
scolding, “grinding,” evidence of distrust, discouragement — 
all negative forces. The latter, working through fear, pro- 
duce at best death-dealing drudgery; the former, acting 
through buoyancy and ambition, produce that joyous effort 
which is creative. 
The private conference may also be used with profit in 
the positive work of developing educational ideas and 
spreading them throughout a system of schools. Suppose 
a supervisor has worked out wholly or partially an educa- 
tional scheme which promises well, what is the best way to 
Distribu- get it into operation? There are the various 
tion of ways of which I have spoken. Visitation of the 
Good Ideas. class-rooms and meetings should be employed; 
but it is very easy, as all superintendents know, for teachers 
to misunderstand instruction given while there are classes 
present and also that given in an address before a body of 
teachers. Some teachers can never be made to see the force 
or method of a new scheme except by first-hand contact 
and observation. Others will grasp a new idea much more 
quickly. 
It is well for the supervisor with an idea to pick out a
-P-A-G-E-137
  The Private Conference 129 
few teachers who quickly grasp ideas, sit down with them 
and carefully explain what he wants done, give the reasons 
for it, let them see the philosophy of his plan and its motive, 
supply them with the necessary material and tell them to 
go into their class-rooms and work it out. Usually they 
will feel complimented by the confidence and will take 
great interest in the development of the plan. This is one 
use of the private conference. The work goes into the class- 
room, and is made practical, and any defects in the original 
scheme are discovered. In later conferences these are 
talked over and remedies are suggested which in turn are 
taken back to the schoolroom. When the plan has not 
only been developed, but has been thus worked out, it is 
ready to be used as an object lesson to other teachers. 
Not infrequently the suggestion comes from the teacher to 
the supervisor directly, or has been derived from work 
observed in his room. In such cases the teacher becomes 
the adviser, and the supervisor, first the pupil, then the 
helper. 
There is a sort of freemasonry among teachers, and others 
very quickly hear of these experiments and become desirous 
to see them and imitate them and, without any especial 
effort, the particularly good work of the strong teachers, 
resulting from the private conference, becomes the standard 
for many other teachers. A single good teacher in a large 
school working out some interesting plan has been known 
to modify the work of the entire school, and so again society 
profits by the individual as well as strengthening the indi- 
vidual, and this is social freedom. This work, which has 
resulted from the private conference, can also be extended 
by direct efforts. Teachers may be sent to visit it, model 
classes may be brought before meetings of teachers showing
-P-A-G-E-138
  130 The School and Its Life 
both how the work is done and its results. This feature 
has been treated under the head of teachers’ meetings. 
So the supervising officer becomes a kind of distributor 
of blessings, receiving what teachers can give and giving what 
is received to those who need it; and he must not, if he would 
be worthy of his office, let any amount of detail work, any 
consideration for the mechanical part of the administration, 
stand in the way of his personal co-operative work with the 
individual teachers. For let us remember that school is a 
society in which all share the good or ill; that this is as true 
of the teachers as it is of the children. 
Recall what was said in a previous chapter, that individual 
freedom is often impaired by the excessive demands of the 
social whole and the obliterating of the individual, but that 
true freedom is to be secured, not by a return to isolation, 
which is in reality extreme. bondage, but rather by a proper 
use of society. The individual teacher should be strength- 
ened, not weakened, by belonging to a system. The strength 
and the wisdom of the whole are greater than that of the 
individual, but only when each individual is encouraged to 
exercise his own strength and also to share with others. 
So that for teachers as for children a school system should 
be a co-operative society, having for its motto “each for all 
and all for each,” and the administrative forces fulfil their 
function when they so distribute the common good that each 
individual has all of his own and all that he can receive from 
the others.

CHAPTER XV 
Jupcinc ResuLts oF TEACHING 
One of the perennial problems of school administration 
is that of judging and rating teachers. 
Recorded and defensible judgment of teachers is necessary 
at times to determine whether they shall be retained in ser- 
vice. This is the lowest use of rating, and, on the whole, 
the most easily made. Some definite system of recorded 
judgment also is needed when teachers are to be selected 
from a corps for promotion to higher places, as principalships. 
In some school systems, too, advances in salary are deter- 
mined by an official rating. For these purposes an accurate, 
definite, and reliable standard is needed. 
No universally satisfactory system of rating has yet been 
approximated, and so far as I know, no method has been 
adopted which is satisfactory even locally. Yet great 
varieties of tests have been made, ranging all the way from 
the unrecorded and unchecked individual judgment of a 
supervising officer to the most elaborate plan of marking 
by points; and while some of these work fairly well, all are 
criticised. This may be due partly to the fact that those who 
are unfavorably affected by such judgments are not to be 
expected to be satisfied. 
What constitutes excellence in a teacher? Is there any 
one characteristic, or any one class of characteristics, which 
can be put down definitely as superior to all others and most 
131
-P-A-G-E-140
  132 The School and Its Life 
to be desired in a teacher? Theoretically, yes; otherwise what 
does the science of teaching mean? How can there be a 
science of education unless there are certain classifiable facts 
relating to its principles? And if the points of good teaching 
can be definitely classified, it is not difficult to see that the 
teachers who manifest these are the good teachers, and, yet, so 
general are our principles, and so varied the characteristics 
of various successful teachers, that the difficulties of proper 
classification and rating are not to be wondered at. 
Teaching, as has often been said in this book, is a spiritual 
process, and its results are not immediately manifest. If a 
Teaching man is placed in charge of a gang of workmen, 
Difficult there are always available standards of com- 
to Judge. parison so that the employer can quickly deter- 
mine whether the man is an efficient foreman or not. A 
salesman in a shop with other salesmen very soon makes it 
evident to the proprietor how he compares with his fellows, 
but the teacher’s work is of so recondite a character, and 
apparent results are so often fallacious, that it is doubtful 
if we shall ever arrive at a strictly satisfactory standard. 
And yet, it does seem that we might have something fuller, 
more reasonable, and more satisfactory to those marked 
than anything yet attempted. But when all is said and done, 
it is so largely a matter of judgment, almost of instinct, that 
probably the sufferers by any system of rating can never be 
satisfied. 
If a salesman, to refer to him again, week after week 
sells only one half as much as a fellow salesman at another 
counter, he must, if at all fair-minded, be compelled to admit 
that he is not so good a salesman; but the inferior teacher is 
practically never ready to make this admission. He sees 
excellences in his own work which he is sure his superior
-P-A-G-E-141
Judging Results of Teaching 133 
officer does not take into consideration in marking him. 
There may be some defects which are noted, but he is quite 
confident that they are overbalanced by unnoted merits. 
With regard to the three classes of cases in which the 
rating of teachers is utilized, as has been already pointed 
out, the case of the teacher who is so poor as to Verveeoor 
merit discharge, or to be in danger of discharge, Teacher 
is the most easily judged. In an ordinary system Easily

extremity are usually flagrant, — manifest upon the surface: 
the order is bad, the teacher’s disposition is offensive, the 
teacher is ignorant, the class does not attain even a rea- 
sonable degree of proficiency. Scarcely ever are less mani- 
fest errors than these treated as sufficiently bad to justify 
discharge, and these can easily be discovered without a sys- 
tem of marking. 
Inasmuch as it is quite necessary to have some principle 
of rating to serve as a basis for promotion to higher positions, 
it is to be taken for granted that such a rating is pig, ey 
possible. It is undoubtedly more difficult to of Judg- 
reach a just determination for promotion than ing for 
when the only question is whether the teacher is PFomoto®- 
to be retained in the system, — many more elements enter 
in, including those characteristics not manifested by the 
teacher in the class-room but which are required in the higher 
field. For example, for a principalship, executive ability 
is a special characteristic, the possession of which it is diffi- 
cult to determine in the case of teachers who have not had 
opportunity to display it. Still, the problem is a fair and just 
one, and we will discuss the principles involved a little later. 
As to the third use of a rating system, — the determination 
of salaries, —it must be confessed that at present there is no
-P-A-G-E-142
  134 The School and Its Life 
status sufficiently reliable to justify it. Theoretically, the 
best teachers should get the best salaries. Practically, in 
large school systems there is so much danger of injustice 
because of the uncertainty of standards that the attempt 
cannot safely and successfully be made at present. If re- 
liance is placed upon marking systems, there are differences 
among markers, and, further, all the evils incident to mark- 
ing systems are introduced. If judgment of superior officers 
is the basis, poor human nature is the sure preventive of 
exact justice. Moreover, no supervising officer could long 
survive the antagonisms created and the charges of par- 
tiality made. So no attempt will here be made to con- 
sider the use of any system for the purpose of determining 
salaries, except in so far as they may be determined by the 
grade of license held or the position occupied. 
It may be said here that one of the chief advantages of a 
definite system of grading teachers is the protection which 
it affords the supervising officer who must make decisions. 
His protection, however, does not require an elaborate, heart- 
breaking system, but a general record is sufficient, made as 
the result of observations from time to time, stated in broad 
terms, supported by the various sorts of written evidence 
that the principal or supervisor can always collect. 
There are two general bases for the grading of teachers 
for all purposes, both of which are valid and should be treated

and “Re- personality and general influence over the pupils

evidences of good teaching, such as the possession of knowl- 
edge by the pupil after a period of instruction. For the just
-P-A-G-E-143
  
Judging Results of Teaching 135 
balancing of these two elements in an official judgment, no 
general rule can be laid down. It will vary with the cases, for 
after all we can never get away from tke human element. 
It must be admitted that some teachers who would be 
rated as poor, according to any accepted technical or exact 
standard, have many admirable qualities which -y¢;, 
make them desirable companions for the young, Relative 
and considering education in the broad sense, these Value. 
elements are of great importance. There are also many 
teachers who, according to any plan of rating that could be 
employed in a large school system, would rank high, with 
whom we would not care to associate ourselves daily, and 
consequently with whom we would not care to have our 
children associated. These fine distinctions cannot be put 
down in any book under any heading, but they will inevi- 
tably influence the judgment of the wise and observant 
supervisor if the exercise of judgment is allowed, — that is, 
if a determination with regard to the standing of the teacher 
is not made to depend wholly upon technical and exact 
ratings, — and they should enter in. Sometimes one is 
disposed to think that they are even more important than 
what is known technically as good teaching. I recall once 
taking a distinguished visitor — a college president who was 
a member of the board of education — to visit a certain 
school, and leading him into the kindergarten. The kinder- 
gartner was a young woman of fine presence, culture, beauty 
and dignity of character, but failing noticeably in those 
characteristics which one could mark, and yet it was a 
happy and wholesome kindergarten. When I spoke of some 
of the defects of the kindergartner to the learned doctor, he 
remarked, “Well, the children are in good society anyway.” 
It set me thinking. I am not sure but that those children  
-P-A-G-E-144
    
136 The School and Its Life, 
were more benefited by the good society they were in than 
they would have been under a strictly orthodox and proper 
kindergartner who might have carried out established prin- 
ciples with entire exactness. 
The argument from all this is that in all estimates made 
of teachers, personality should be included, and by this 
is meant that vague, indefinite, spiritual quality which can- 
not be put down in words, much less indicated in figures or 
other symbols, such as are used commonly in the formal 
rating of teachers; and this means that somebody’s judg- 
ment must be exercised. 
There are certain features of what is known as civil ser- 
vice reform, which, carried to the extreme, are disastrous 
Dangers 10 any system, and particularly so in the spiritual

judgment official valuation, then there is no such thing as 
estimating good teaching. In trying to get away from pull 
and favoritism we are in danger of going so far as to do 
away with human interest and to reduce our school systems 
to the condition of machines, which is always one of the 
perils of large systems. 
RESULTS 
The second and more commonly recognized basis for 
rating is what are ordinarily called results. Now, 
elk what Its? No t Id bi more than what are results VO erm cou. e mee mis- 
Fitting leading. As usually interpreted, the least impor-

a a. included in this term, and the commonplace, 
* jron-clad teacher can get the kind of results which 
extreme officialism wants. The most simple, direct, and
-P-A-G-E-145
  Judging Results of Teaching 137 
easily ascertained results are those which by some have 
been exalted into an educational deity, viz.: the ability to 
answer questions of fact, in other words, examinations. 
Many teachers like to teach for such a standard because 
it is easy. Their work is cut out for them; they are not 
compelled to think, except in so far as mental acumen may 
be employed in inferring what the next examination is going 
to be from what the preceding have been, and then drilling 
the children on the supposititious questions to be’ asked. 
Of course, this is not teaching, but it is what results from 
this method of rating either pupils or teachers. If the 
teacher knows that he is to be rated for any purpose accord- 
ing to the number of children who “pass,” he naturally 
will bend every effort to have a large number of children 
pass, and if the promotion is based upon a set examination, 
furnished from headquarters, the shrewd teacher very quickly 
learns what sort of an examination is coming and drills his 
children accordingly. 
Under such a system it very commonly happens that the 
poorest schools, judged according to a broad standard of 
education, regularly get the largest number of “certificates,” 
and the poor teachers, judged by spiritual results, are 
many of them able to drill the few inconsequential facts re- 
quired for the examination into their children so that they 
can “pass,”’ while the good teachers, whose influence upon the 
lives of the children is broadening, sweetening, and stimu- 
lating, fail to prepare the children to meet the required 
standard because their time has been spent upon better 
things. Their children know much more than those who 
can pass the examination, but it is not the same knowledge, 
and it is not so easily categoried for question and ‘answer; 
consequently it is of no use. Interest under such a system
-P-A-G-E-146
  138 The School and Its Life 
is disastrous, because interest leads minds afield and asks 
many questions. 
So it is evident that for a proper basis we must broaden the 
term “results.” Aside from the ability to answer questions, 
what should be the result of a good teacher’s teaching? 
First, interest in the work itself and in its larger phases. 
If the subject is history, a result of the study should be not 
so much the ability to remember facts and their 
dates, as the kind of interest which prompts the 
student to read much more than is required for the examina- 
tion, and to continue to be a student of history after the work 
of the school is ended. 
Second, the kind of knowledge that makes the pursuit 
of further knowledge possible, which is quite different from 
Apperceiv- the ability to answer the ordinary examination 
ingCenters. questions. It means the possession of salient 
and suggestive points, — those points which furnish apper- 
ceiving centers for new knowledge, and which are perhaps 
most noticeably manifested in an inquiring mind and an 
intelligent curiosity. 
A third result is the ability to pursue a study, not merely 
when prompted by a secondary end, such as a prize or a 
Applica- | mark, but for the sake of the study itself, and to 
tion. pursue it beyond the mere requirements of the 
school with intensity, continuity, and success. The old- 
fashioned application, in other words, and the power of 
abstraction from surrounding influences and from secondary 
impulses, must be added to the kind of interest of which I 
have spoken. The child acquires the power of intense appli- 
cation from being intensely interested, and the habit of such 
application comes from repeated absorption in a valuable 
occupation. These are typical results. It is not by any Interest. 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  udging Results of Teachin I ging g 39 
means an exhaustive list, but is named simply to illustrate 
that product of teaching which is higher than the ordinarily 
valued “result.” 
Now the question arises, can these results be definitely 
ascertained so as to form a basis of rating, and if so, how? 
It certainly is not easy to formulate any definite plan of 
rating the spiritual and higher intellectual results of teach- 
ing. Here again we must rely upon the judgment of 
supervising officials, and get away absolutely, but gradually, 
from the fetich of the civil service reformer that every- 
thing can be determined by examination. In the end our 
schools will be better off. Is it possible, however, to make 
such rating? pe 
First, as to interest: There are several indications which 
may guide the supervisor. Commonly a visit to the class- 
room is a fairly reliable, though inadequate, guide. Indications

shown. It is to be remembered that the interest referred to 
here is a very different thing from that nervousness which 
is often manifested during the recitation and which passes 
for interest — the apparent excitement of children over what 
is being presented to them that is shown in an undue eager- 
ness to talk, in the raising and waving of hands. Teachers 
themselves are often deceived by this fictitious and super- 
ficial interest. It bears about the same relation to vital 
interest that the excitation of the muscles of a frog’s legs by 
a galvanic battery does to a good jump, and it is often the 
product of the professional smile and the professional flutter- 
ing of the teacher, — the substitution of cutaneous excite- 
ment for activity of the spirit. Children in this state of 
unwholesome and deceptive activity bob up and down con- 
tinually like little jacks-in-the-box with the hope of catching
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 The School and Its Life 
the teacher’s eye, and often without a solitary thought be- 
yond that. Real interest by a class is manifested in the 
recitation, of course, and the keen observer cannot fail to 
detect it; the bright eye, the earnest look, the serious and 
thoughtful question, and attentive listening, are indications; 
the desire to know, more than the desire to shine; the de- 
sire to tell when there is something really worth telling, rather 
than the desire to be heard. But the best criterion of the 
real power of the teacher to stimulate interest is found in that 
portion of the class not reciting. 
(Of course it is taken for granted that the class is di- 
vided into sections.) The kind of zeal which controls the 
children at their seats in the pursuit of further knowledge 
is a good test of the teacher’s power. If the children are 
studying in such a way as to get the most out of the subject, 
not simply committing to memory answers to questions so as 
to be able to recite and get a mark; if they are inquisitive 
and are consulting books of reference —are really pursu- 
ing their subjects —it speaks well for the teacher. And 
especially if the subject-matter of the class-room becomes 
the topic of conversation after school and at intermissions, 
not flippant or slighting, but in earnest inquiry, it speaks 
well for the teacher. And if the pupils, after promotion, 
carry into the class above interest in one or more subjects 
and a superior knowledge of these subjects, with a desire 
to pursue them further, this, perhaps, best of all, shows that 
the teacher has been successful in stimulating the right kind 
of interest. 
If, on the other hand, there is a lack of devotion to the 
ends of the school, if the children are idle and listless and 
frittering away their time, it is a bad sign. If they are 
struggling eagerly and fiercely for marks, and holding the
-P-A-G-E-149
  Judging Results of Teaching 141 
teacher to the categorical question and answer, which makes 
it possible for them to be marked, this is almost as bad a 
sign as listlessness or inattention. The children who openly 
manifest their lack of interest in what is going on are pretty 
sure to find something that does interest them. The chil- 
dren who are studying for marks are interested, but in that 
which is a source of evil rather. than of good. 
Even with the youngest children there may be developed 
an interest in life itself, in the vital problems which must 
be met even by them, and if there is a tendency among the 
children to apply the teaching of the school to the problems 
out of school—to solve serious questions by means of 
the help which the school has furnished — that is perhaps 
the very highest proof of all that the right kind of teach- 
ing is done, and the right sort of interest created. 
The second result named is the kind of knowledge that 
is fruitful or that may be used for apperceiving centers. 
If the pupils, after a recitation, possess a few oonsidera- 
facts which they regard as final, so that they tions of 
think they have a thorough knowledge of the Thorough- 
subject, the teaching has been bad. There is a "°** 
very popular fetich known as ‘“‘thoroughness” which means 
the picking out of a few facts, so unimportant and so limited 
that they can be known with approximate thoroughness 
by the inferior mind, and teaching these to the exclusion 
of the broader knowledge which reaches out into the world 
continually for more knowledge. If the pupils go to their 
seats satisfied with having answered all the questions, with 
no unanswered questions, with no desire to go on and tie 
new knowledge to the old, the teaching has been poor. If 
they go to their seats, not thinking much about what 
kind of a recitation has been made, but full of the subject 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  142 The School and Its Life 
and eager to know more of it, and disposed to attach all 
new things that come into the mind to the old as coérdinate 
parts, then the teaching has been good. Good teaching 
relates all the parts and makes it possible for the children 
to see new relations between the new and the old. Any 
teaching which produces a sense of finality and complete- 
ness, or so-called “thoroughness,” is hopelessly bad. Much 
better the teaching which closes up nothing but sets the 
tentacles of the mind all agog for new possessions, than that 
which closes up everything, the tentacles themselves in- 
cluded. 
This sort of knowledge does not necessarily exclude cer- 
tainty on minor points. It is possible to know the few 
inconsequential things just as well with good teaching as 
with poor, but with this difference: the result does not stop 
with the small attainment but goes on into a wider world 
and the mind continually enriches itself by the new things 
that it attaches to itself through their natural affinity for 
the old. It is only such knowledge that is really worth while, 
— the knowledge that is never final but is always second- 
ary; that continually enlarges desire for more knowledge; 
that places the student in the attitude of Newton upon 
the seashore. All good teaching gives this, and the degree 
to which this sort of knowledge is imparted is one of 
the perfectly fair criteria by which the teacher may be 
judged. 
The third result of good teaching, that cannot be included 
in a category, is the ability to pursue study for its own end 
Pursuitof and beyond the limits of school requirements,

the elimination of secondary ends, such as prizes, marks, and

  udging Results of Teachin 143 ging & 
punishments, from among the stimulants to study. It means 
also the reaching out for new knowledge, of which mention 
has already been made. It means, further, however, the 
power of concentration upon a subject, making Concen- 
pursuit for the time being an end in itself, and tration. 
shutting out all extraneous and disturbing matters. This 
power of hard study by the pupil alone and unaided, for the 
sake of the desired primary end, is one of the highest re- 
sults of good teaching. It can almost never, if ever, be se- 
cured in a school where there is mass teaching, — that is, 
where the classes all recite together and all study together 
with the teacher ever at hand. But the child who can sit 
down in a schoolroom while a class is reciting an interesting 
lesson to the teacher, and be deaf and blind to all this and 
become so absorbed in his study that he pursues it earnestly 
without regard to anything else, has acquired a power which, 
under ordinary circumstances, presages success in life, and 
it can be the result, at least to a degree, of good teaching. 
Of course there are great differences in minds, and some 
minds never can concentrate closely, but all can improve 
under the régime of the school if the teacher is of the right 
sort, if the interests are in the right direction, and if the ends 
pursued are such as appeal to the children as worth while. 
And this is another high mark of good teaching. 
These three results, while they are more tangible than 
the higher spiritual results of which I spoke at first, still are 
to a degree intangible and cannot be exactly re- pect 
corded. It is not easy to mark teachers on the Results 
basis of these results by definite symbols, but Mtangible. 
the observant supervisor knows whether any or all of them 
are obtained by the teachers and, within reasonable limits, 
to what degree, —that is, he can say with a fair degree of
-P-A-G-E-152
  144 The School and Its Life 
confidence whether, so far as schoolroom achievement is con- 
cerned, Miss Smith or Miss Jones ought to be appointed 
to a principalship, both having the proper license. As to 
estimating the ability of teachers to do work which they 
have not yet done, as for example, to exercise the func- 
tions of principal, that again is a matter of judgment and 
of inference to be drawn from all the various points which 
have been discussed, and many which have not been 
mentioned. 
So that in conclusion we come back again to the asser- 
tion that no code of rules, civil service or other, can, with 
Teachers @2Y exactness or precision, or by any formal

Judged by finer points of excellence in teaching which really

yste™® These can be determined only by observation in 
contact with teachers by critics possessed of sound sense 
and fairness, and it is necessary that school systems rely 
upon the possession of these qualities by the supervising 
force, otherwise the whole system becomes mechanical and 
lifeless. Records of observations should be kept by those 
observing, as carefully as possible, but no attempt should 
be made at exact mathematical rating. There is no meas- 
ure for the spirit nor for spiritual work. The principles of 
promotion by examination alone as applied to teachers are 
fraught with error and with evil of all kinds. They have 
in some places been introduced as a substitute for the po- 
litical patronage which sometimes creeps into schools, and 
they have done some good in this respect, but they can 
never be the final criteria as to the power of the teachers. 
They can never serve as a proper sole basis for the promo- 
tion of teachers. While their introduction as such a basis

  Judging Results of Teaching 145 
may, in some cases, remove political influence, it brings with 
it greater evils, because even under a bad political system 
personal judgment has weight and excellence does to a de- 
gree tell. Under a mechanical system excellence of the 
highest sort does not tell; it rather stands in the way, and 
the mechanical virtues which can be rated are inevitably 
placed above the spiritual virtues which are beyond compu- 
tation.

THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT 
Tuus far the school superintendent has been taken for 
granted. His various functions and necessary qualifications 
have been referred to from time to time and opinions have 
been expressed regarding some of them. It now seems time 
to treat of the school superintendent fully and connectedly. 
It is to be remembered in all discussions regarding this

very much of experimentation, with the widest variety of 
duties, and there are wide differences of opinion and prac-

newness and his evolutionary state. 
The position of the principal is a comparatively settled 
one, as is also the position of the school board. Whatever of 
uncertainty and change is found in relation to their functions 
grows out of a reciprocal change in regard to the superin- 
tendent. Gradually, as he evolves, he is modifying the 
power, the position, and the work of the older functionaries.

As, strictly speaking, we have no national system of edu- 
cation and no head with authority, and, even in our States, 
for the most part, heads with very limited au- Offices Dif- 
thority, the position of the superintendent of fer Widely 
schools in any community is a local affair and in Differ- 
due to local conditions, except as these are modi- a 
fied by the diffusion of knowledge and by the ; 
influence of the general movement which is sweeping not 
only the land but the civilized world. These general influ- 
ences, however, are not yet of sufficient potency to produce 
very close resemblances in the functions of superintendents 
of schools in cities or rural communities having widely 
diverse origins and ideals. 
The superintendent of schools of Boston is a very differ- 
ent official from the one bearing the same name in New 
York. The former has little more than clerical duties to 
perform, except a few which are on paper and given him 
by the board of education. They are not statutory duties. 
The latter, on the other hand, is a statutory official possessed 
of very great power. He is in no sense the clerk of the board 
of education, and only in a very few senses its servant. The 
superintendent of schools in several cities in Ohio, until the 
recent upheaval, has been in many respects an autocrat, 
with functions quite different from those of the board of 
education, and in few senses subordinate to them. 
These are instances of wide divergence, due to different 
historical development, and indicate how difficult it is to 
generalize regarding the ideal characteristics of a school 
superintendent. It takes a man of one type to be a success- 
ful subservient clerk and confidential adviser of the board 
of education, which arrogates to itself, or has inherited, 
all legislative and executive functions relating to the admin- 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
148 The School and Its Life 
istration of the schools; it takes a man of a very different 
type to exercise the authority imposed by law of appointing 
teachers, determining courses of study, and, in general, direct- 
ing the school system. In some instances the superintend- 
ents who have been quite successful in the former capacity 
have not succeeded very well when by a change in method of 
administration new powers have been conferred upon them. 
Nor is it desirable to have uniform laws throughout the 
country, giving superintendents of schools the same powers 
Uniformity and duties in all places. Local conditions are of

attempt to put in force in Boston, for instance, a law such 
as that which has prevailed in Cleveland would doubtless 
result in endless bickering and wrangling, if not in complete 
failure. Boston people are accustomed to rely upon the 
school committee to run their schools, and would rather 
have them do it badly than to have an autocratic superin- 
tendent do it well. 
Notwithstanding all this there are certain general character- 
istics that belong almost of necessity to the successful school

generically. Many of the extreme views held in certain 
places, by certain radical reformers, have been materially 
modified and are likely to be more so, and, on the other 
hand, the very conservative views held by some of the older 
communities will also be modified by the passage of time 
and by contact with a moving world. But the time will 
never come, we should confidently hope, when a school 
superintendent’s duties and powers will not vary with the
-P-A-G-E-157
  The School Superintendent 149 
community, and the best superintendent will be the one 
who fits local conditions and, if he moves from place to 
place, is able to adapt himself to the circumstances grow- 
ing out of new environment. 
With this introduction let us consider as well as we 
may the school superintendent. As has been said, he is the 
result of very recent development. At first he was not sup- 
posed to have technical skill. His office was largely clerical. 
As communities grew and schools increased in number it 
became necessary to have some connecting link which, for 
clerical and official purposes, should preserve a sort of unity. 
The schoolmasters were the educational experts who were 
supposed to run the schools. The school board was the 
general directing agency, and the additional official came 
into office simply to represent the board. 
VARIOUS FORMS AND STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT 
In some parts of the country the office has not yet ad- 
vanced beyond this rudimentary stage. In some cities there 
are still superintendents who are minor function- Examples 
aries; in some cases appointed by the board of of Vari- 
education, and in some cases elected by the people, #t- 
with no educational function whatever. Twenty years ago, 
and even much more recently, there were many such. I re- 
call an experience years ago in a city where the superin- 
tendent of schools was a small local politician, elected to the 
office by the people, and paid, if my memory serves me 
rightly, the munificent sum of two hundred dollars a year. 
He was supposed to keep the records and distribute report 
blanks. This particular incumbent magnified his office and 
occasionally held teachers’ meetings at which the report 
blanks were discussed. The principals were literally the
-P-A-G-E-158
150 The School and Its Life 
heads of their schools. The high school principal was the 
chief educational official and performed some of the duties 
that the school superintendent now performs. If I am not 
mistaken, this rule still prevails in that city. 
In other cities, as in Philadelphia, the school superintend- 
ent has been evolved into the educational adviser, prac- 
tically without executive functions. In still others he is the 
executive officer of the board with considerable power, which 
varies according to his executive ability, his capacity to hold 
authority, and the willingness of the board of education to 
part with some of its legal powers. Even in such an uncer- 
tain state a strong superintendent will pretty nearly dominate 
the school system of which he is the head; will select teachers 
for appointment; will prepare and direct courses of study; 
and will be reckoned upon by the board of education as a 
factor in anything that they may do, and this even with a 
board of strong political tendencies. In the same system 
a weak superintendent will have no authority in regard to 
anything. That is, it is a matter of personal force and not 
of statutory powers and functions. 
In other cities, as has been said, the evolution has gone 
so far that possibly a reversion of type will be necessary. 
That is, the superintendent has acquired pretty nearly auto- 
cratic powers. He is not merely the executive adviser of the 
board, but is vested with certain legislative functions. This 
was rather too much the case in the late Ohio law, and the 
new laws are distinctly reactionary though possibly not too 
much so. 
VIEWED GENERICALLY 
But out of all this uncertainty and lack of uniformity, 
a few truths are beginning to emerge clearly and definitely.
-P-A-G-E-159
The School Superintendent 151 
The school superintendent is becoming an expert. He is 
coming to be recognized the country over as a man who 
has made a thorough study of certain educational g,, ene 
problems and is more familiar with them than tendent 
other people are. When a vacancy occurs in the Becoming 
superintendency of a city, it is becoming yearly ® pert. 
more and more common to go outside to find a man who 
has had training as a superintendent in some other city. 
Occasionally the cry is still raised that home talent is good 
enough, and untrained men are put into the office and receive 
their training there, but this is disappearing. Our better 
and higher professional schools are offering courses of train- 
ing designed especially for those who intend to undertake the 
work of supervision, and the normal step is coming to be 
from the position of school principal to that of school super- 
visor or superintendent in a small town, where the functions 
are little different from those of the principal of a single 
school, and from that to the superintendency of a larger 
town, until the very large ones are reached. 
Sometimes the door of approach is from a county super- 
intendency, but the important point is that the superintend- 
ent is more and more recognized as an expert. This is 
not less so in those places in which he is merely the official 
adviser of the board, than in those in which he is the real 
executive head of the school system. 
There are two general classes of work in which the super- 
intendent is supposed to excel and in which his power is 
growing. They are the selection of teachers and yo 
the direction of teaching. There are very few Recognized 
cities having a school superintendent in which he Functions. 
has not at least some voice in both of these matters. Some- 
times the voice is very small and ineffective, but he is
-P-A-G-E-160
  152 The School and Its Life 
expected to have something to say about the selection of 
teachers and something to say about the character of the 
work done in schools. He is no longer, except in a very 
few instances, merely a clerical assistant. 
As to the former of these duties — the selection of teachers 
—his powers vary from the vaguest, most indefinite advice 
to the board and the endorsement of the board’s action, 
through the grades of licensing and nominating to that of 
actual undisputed appointment, and opinions differ widely 
as to where in this scale he should properly stand. 
In regard to the direction of work, there is also a scale, 
but there is less uncertainty than with regard to the appoint- 
ment of teachers. There are very few systems in which the 
superintendent does not prepare the course of study, at least 
for the approval of the board of education, and, when the 
course has been adopted, does not supervise its adminis- 
tration. Sometimes, it is true, this supervision has very 
little effect because the superintendent is unable to take 
remedial measures if the teachers do not obey his instruc- 
tions; but even this is rapidly passing. 
We must consider what power it is really best to have 
bestowed upon superintendents of schools under average 
conditions, with regard to these two general functions. 
ONE-MAN POWER 
First, as to the appointment and disciplining of teachers: 
Is the one-man power about which we hear so much in these 
days advisable? If not, how much power should the super- 
intendent have? The idea of making the superintendent 
practically absolute over the body of teachers had at one 
time very many advocates, especially among superintend- 
ents themselves and radical reformers. The criticisms
-P-A-G-E-161
  The School Superintendent 153 
upon such laws as those prevailing at that time in Cleveland 
and other Ohio cities was not that the superintendent was 
too absolute, but that he was not sufficiently protected in his 
own office. That is, while he was practically absolute with 
regard to the appointment of teachers, it was felt that his 
own position might be endangered through the enmity 
aroused, and undoubtedly that feature of the laws was 
inconsistent with the general scheme. 
It is quite evident to students of public opinion that the 
idea of the one-man power is passing, and I am convinced 
that in the future in the average city, while the superintend- 
ent will be an important official with much power, he will 
be subject to certain checks from the representatives of the 
people, which will safeguard both him and the schools. 
The advocates of the granting of absolute power to the 
superintendent point to great business concerns with their 
authoritative executive officers who can appoint eae Work of or dismiss employees at pleasure. They forget guroois 
that while the public school system is a great and Busi- 
business, it is more —it is a public institution, ness _ 
part of the governmental machinery, not the —— 
agent of a few people working for their own ad- 
vantage, but the representative of all the people. They 
forget further that the results of the school administration 
are not so tangible as those of a business organization, as 
a railroad or factory; that they cannot be adjudged by the 
examination of a set of books, but that they are metaphysi- 
cal, remote, and difficult to prove; that often the best judges 
are the heads of families to which the children belong, 
who are consequently in daily touch with the children. 
Schools must give pupils the kind of training that the 
average citizen wants for his children, and not that which 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  154 The School and Its Life 
an administrative officer, however expert, may think best 
for them. In the long run, better schools and a wiser edu- 
cational system will grow out of the demands of the people 
than can be secured by the ablest educational expert 
working alone. An emperor is not a good type for a school 
superintendent. It is not good for any man to have abso- 
lute power, nor is it good for any institution, small or large, 
to be under the absolute domination of a single will. Par- 
ticularly is this true of an institution like a school system, 
which depends for its excellence upon the intelligent co- 
operation and sympathetic work of a large number of people. 
The teachers in a school system cannot be treated as 
“hands,” without imperiling the work of the schools. The 
work of the teachers is spiritual work, and no teacher teach- 
ing under the absolute domination of another’s will can do 
his best work. Nor is it good for the superintendent himself 
to be absolute. For the average superintendent it is not 
safe. He is likely to wreck himself in a very short time. 
OFFICIAL RELATIONSHIPS 
The relation of the superintendent of schools to the appoint- 
ment of the teaching force should be somewhat like that of 
‘ the President of the United States to the appoint- 
cee ment of postmasters. It should not be possible 
should for a board of education to appoint a teacher with- 
have Nomi- out the approval of the superintendent, nor should 
rane, the superintendent be able to appoint a teacher 
Fs without the approval of the board of educa- 
tion. This gives the superintendent all the power he needs, 
because no one individual is essential to a school system, 
and commonly if there is strong objection on the part of 
the board to any individual there is good reason for it, and
-P-A-G-E-163
  The School Superintendent 155 
the superintendent is better off as a superintendent with 
some one else in place of the objectionable teacher. 
Moreover, to a very large extent the success of a system 
depends upon public support. The board of education 
represents the people; an appointment made by Board 
the superintendent and confirmed by the board, should 
to a degree divides the responsibility. The super- Share 
intendent is primarily responsible, but the board Respon- 
of education is also responsible to the people. ae 
Its individual members cannot shirk such responsibility. 
If improper teachers are appointed and confirmed by them, 
the superintendent, of course, will merit the first blame and 
will get it; but the members of the board of education can- 
not join the issue against the superintendent, — they are 
likewise responsible. This is a source of great strength to 
the superintendent. 
As to the discipline of teachers, the superintendent should 
have the power of suspension, but not of final removal. 
The board of education should again share the responsi- 
bility, and the teacher should be allowed to continue unless 
the board can be brought to approve of the suspension. A 
wise superintendent wants all the strength, all the support, 
that he can get, and, in general, it is safe to say that if he 
is unable to convince an ordinary board of education of 
the justice of his action he is probably wrong, though of 
course not necessarily. Surely, if he cannot convince the 
board, over whom, if he is the right kind of man, he will 
almost certainly have an influence, he cannot convince the 
public. 
The same general principles apply to the adoption of a 
course of study. It is absolutely necessary that the people 
through their representatives approve a course of study
-P-A-G-E-164
  156 The School and Its Life 
if it is to accomplish the best results, and if the superin- 
tendent is unable to persuade a board of education that his 
course of study is a good one, it probably is not altogether 
good. At least he can afford to be patient and to wait, 
but his time need not be wasted. It may be employed in 
educating the public and the board up to his own ad- 
vanced ideas. 
POWER OF INITIATIVE 
A superintendent who has the power of initiative in all 
important matters, such as the appointment of teachers 
Power of and the making of the course of study, but whose 
Initiative actions must be confirmed by the board of edu- 
All that is cation, has all the power he needs and all that is 
meeded: good for him. If he is the right man for the 
place he can practically dominate the situation. If he can- 
not dominate the situation, cannot secure sufficient influ- 
ence with the board of education to induce them to follow 
his leadership, he is not the man for the place. In general, 
a good and strong superintendent will have his way even 
under a bad system and a bad board, and the weak 
superintendent will not have his way even if his power 
is absolute; he will be dominated by somebody, if not 
by the school board, by commercial influences, social 
influences, church influences, or political influences. No 
system can be devised which will make a strong superin- 
tendent or a successful one out of a weak one, and the 
good superintendent ought not to ask for more than the 
opportunity to initiate movements and advocate them 
before the board of education. With this, if he cannot 
succeed in persuading the board that he is right, the proba- 
bility is that he is wrong.
-P-A-G-E-165
  The School Superintendent 157 
STATUTORY EXECUTIVE POWERS AND DUTIES 
But when all is said it remains that the superintendent 
of schools, whether in city or country, should be an official 
with very considerable statutory powers. The eitain 
character of his office, the duties that devolve Powers 
upon him, and the responsibility that he is to should be 
carry, should be fixed by law and not left to the St@tutory. 
whim or prejudice of changing boards of education, and, 
as I have said, they should be very considerable indeed. 
He should be in reality, as in name, the executive officer 
of the educational system, carrying out the mandates of 
the board of education, who act as the people’s represent- 
atives and who are the proper legislative officers, and having 
certain specific powers with which even the board cannot 
interfere. 
Among these powers should be, first, that of nominating 
all subordinates in the school system — supervisors, prin- 
cipals, and all classes of teachers. This should be abso- 
lute. It should be impossible for a board to appoint any 
teacher or any one connected with the school system on 
the educational side unless such person has been nominated 
by the superintendent. If the board fail to confirm any 
nomination of the superintendent, then it should be his 
duty to make another. 
He should also have power to transfer all teachers for 
the good of the service provided such transfer does not 
involve degradation as to position or reduction of salary. 
If a teacher has been suspended, the approval or disapproval 
of the suspension should rest with the board of education. 
It should be a statutory duty of the superintendent of 
schools to prepare a course of study and administer it.
-P-A-G-E-166
  158 The School and Its Life 
Such a course, however, should require the approval of the 
board of education before final adoption. Once adopted, 
it should rest with the superintendent to interpret it and 
to see that it is carried out by the teachers. This should 
include authority to call teachers together and to give them 
definite instruction to that end. 
In the matter of licensing teachers, the superintendent 
should have a voice, but should not be the sole licensing 
authority. If there is a special licensing board he should 
be a member of it. 
These are the essential statutory powers of the super- 
intendent of schools everywhere. What more he should 
make of his office is a matter for further discussion. The 
strong superintendent exerts a vast influence, not only upon 
the schools, but upon the community, far beyond the statu- 
tory definitions of his functions. oo
-P-A-G-E-167
CHAPTER XVII 
Tue ScHooL SUPERINTENDENT (Continued) 
Even in the present rudimentary stage of the school 
superintendent he is much more than a statutory officer, 
and if there is no change in the trend of the development, 
he will come to be in his community a social factor of the 
first importance. 
The people of a municipality elect a comptroller, and 
every citizen knows, or can know, just what the comptroller’s 
business is and how well he fulfils his various functions, 
because they are clear and definite and very little affected 
by his personality. He may be agreeable, or disagreeable; 
he may be personally influential, or personally insignificant; 
but if he is a good bookkeeper and honest, and reasonably 
intelligent, he may be a good comptroller, and no duties 
calling for the possession of higher qualifications ordinarily 
rest upon him. That is true of most public functionaries. 
The question of personality is merely a question which 
affects their own relations with other people and their own 
welfare. It is not an important element, except politically, 
in the performance of their various public duties. This 
is not quite so true of the mayor of a city as it is of the 
comptroller, but even in his case personality is of minor 
importance. In members of boards, such as common 
council, board of estimate and apportionment, and school 
board, it is of comparatively little consequence what the men 
159 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  160 The School and Its Life 
are personally, if they perform honestly, intelligently, and 
efficiently the prescribed duties. 
With the school superintendent quite the contrary is true. 
His statutory duties are in many respects the least impor- 
tant of those that rest upon him. Many a school superin- 
tendent is honest and reasonably intelligent and able to 
perform efficiently the duties required of him by statute, 
and yet is a complete failure as a school superintendent. 
The good school superintendent of necessity enters into 
somewhat close personal relations with many people — 
Varied Re- With the board of education; with the body of 
lations of teachers; with some of the children; and with 
the Super- Jarge numbers of the parents. And these relations 
intendent. +e of the utmost importance. The manner in 
which he establishes and maintains them and the character 
he gives them will determine almost wholly his success as 
a school superintendent, at least in the higher sense. A 
superintendent may be able to write valuable reports for the 
edification of the public; he may be able to make good 
recommendations, and force them through the board of edu- 
cation; he may be able to formulate a good course of study, 
and excellent rules for the governing of teachers; but unless 
he can establish the right personal relations with these dif- 
ferent people he will be surprised at the slight effect of his 
various activities. 
This point is emphasized to such an extent, because it 
is too commonly overlooked. Especially in discussions of 
school reforms, we are disposed to place relatively un- 
due emphasis upon the right law and the proper statutory 
conditions. Not that these latter are unimportant; indeed 
they are of great consequence, as is shown in the preced- 
ing chapter. But they are mere conditions. The school
-P-A-G-E-169
  
The School Superintendent (Continued) 161 
superintendent’s success depends upon other foundations. 
His functions are vastly higher than can be indicated by any 
statutes, and his usefulness is determined by the exercise 
of powers that cannot be indicated in any law or code of 
regulations. Possibly it is this fact which has led some 
very astute observers, for example, Dr. J. M. Rice, the 
editor of The Forum, to the belief that the right political 
conditions for the government of schools are of compara- 
tively little consequence, because some school superintend- 
ents have succeeded in making good schools under the 
worst political conditions, and the very best political con- 
ditions do not necessarily bring good schools. In the large 
city and in the small alike the excellence of the schools will 
depend chiefly upon the success of the school superintend- 
ent in obeying the unwritten law, and in meeting those 
conditions that are personal and that cannot be set down 
in any ordinance. 
It is difficult to state which of the classes of relations 
mentioned is of the greatest importance, so without attempt- 
ing to decide this question let us consider first the relations, 
personal and otherwise, of the school superintendent with 
the school board. 
In most cities the superintendent receives his appoint- 
ment from the school board. This of itself makes it neces- 
sary, if he desires to retain his place and secure re-election 
at the expiration of his term, that he maintain harmonious 
relations with the board; but this is the least worthy motive 
for maintaining such relations. 
Theoretically, the superintendent is the employee, and, 
in many matters, the executive of the board; and as has been 
pointed out in a preceding chapter, the power conferred 
upon him varies greatly. But whatever the degree of  
-P-A-G-E-170
  162 The School and Its Life 
responsibility given the superintendent, the character of his 
relation to the board is reasonably uniform. 
In a few large cities in which the superintendent has great 
statutory power he can succeed in accomplishing much by 
a vigorous exercise of his power, if his relations with the 
board are inharmonious, or even positively antagonistic; 
but he cannot accomplish as much as he can if the relations 
are harmonious, even in those cases in which he has the very 
greatest statutory authority. 
It must be borne in mind that the results which the super- 
intendent seeks to produce in his work are spiritual results. 
Results _—‘It is one thing to have regulations passed, courses 
Sought of study adopted and printed, and even formally 
Spiritual. put into execution. It is quite another thing to se- 
cure in the schools the spiritual result which only is education. 
A school board, whether large or small, whether wise or 
unwise, whether honest or corrupt, is composed of citizens

People. consequence and influence among some classes 
of the community, otherwise they never could have secured 
the positions accorded them. If they are personally, as 
well as officially, in harmony with the school superintendent 
and believe heartily in the various things that he is doing, 
or trying to do, in the schools, the support which they can 
give extra-officially is very great, greater than most super- 
intendents are willing to admit. Particularly in those cities 
in which the statutory powers of the superintendent are 
limited and the school board is the legal seat of all, or 
nearly all, authority, the harmonious relations of the super- 
intendent and board are essential to the carrying out of even 
the smallest wishes of the superintendent.
-P-A-G-E-171
The School Superintendent (Continued) 163 
I do not know of an instance of a superintendent getting 
done in the schools the work that he wants done while his 
relations with the school board are for a consider- pojations 
able time inharmonious. Of course it happens should be 
to nearly every superintendent to be occasionally Harmo- 
and for brief periods at outs with his board, ™°4* 
but unless he can ultimately bring them to his way of 
thinking and make them his supporters, he can accomplish 
little. 
Now, how is a superintendent to maintain harmonious 
relations with a board, composed partly of cranks, partly 
of dishonest men, partly of self-seeking politicians, partly 
of good, well-intentioned obstinate ones, and partly of really 
good members? 
The question cannot be answered in a sentence. There 
is no specific for the case, but it is safe to say that it is not 
necessary to sacrifice principle in order to SECUTCE or ould be 
such harmony. It is necessary sometimes to wait. patient. 
A superintendent should be patient, and if a good Must Edu- 
thing that he has in mind cannot be secured at Ste the : Public. once, he should not lose his temper or denounce 
the board of education or the unthinking public. His busi- 
ness is to educate, not merely the children, but the whole 
public. Indeed, that is his greatest, highest, and noblest 
function. If his point of view is reasonably sound, and 
if he is wise and patient, he can almost always bring at least 
the board of education to support him. 
The trouble with many superintendents is that, like many 
other good people who desire to see good things done in the 
world, they are pugnacious and narrow, and unable to take 
any other point of view than the one which comes to them 
most easily. Many a good man loses his chance to do good 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
164 The School and Its Life 
by standing up and declaring too loudly that he is good and 
implying that other people are bad. 
The superintendent who desires to exert influence in the 
community does not need to be a compromiser, but he does 
need to bear in mind that no one is wholly bad; that most 
of the people with whom he has to deal are reasonably self- 
respecting and honest people whose motives are possibly as 
good as his own, and that even if this is not true, they at 
least have some good motives and are capable of being ap- 
pealed to through them. 
If the members of the board are ignorant, as a rule they 
are highly complimented if they are taken into the confi- 
dence of the superintendent and are put into a position to 
support a new, broad, and highly intellectual policy. 
The superintendent who desires to maintain the support

board in a formal report in terms which often its members 
do not understand and has startled them into opposition; 
whereas, if he had quietly sat down with a few of the influ- 
ential men, and sometimes with those not so influential, and 
explained his project and made them think that they would 
be responsible for doing a good thing if they supported it, 
he could have secured his end. 
The superintendent should treat the members of the board 
of education as men worthy of respect, at least for the position 
they hold, and should not make them feel too decidedly 
his own superiority. Yet a superintendent makes a grave 
mistake who lowers himself, especially morally, in order

to be in touch with the influential members of his board. 
The comparatively ignorant and commonplace must not

likes to feel that he is on good terms with him, but, at the 
same time, it is a matter of pride for him to be able to 
say, “Our superintendent is a superior man”; and the 
superintendent who lowers himself in moral or intellectual 
tone for the sake of keeping in sympathy with such men is 
likely to lose more than he will gain. That is, the members 
of a school board want to feel that the superintendent is a 
superior man, but they do not want to feel that he feels him- 
self a superior. It is a higher compliment for him to seek to 
treat them as upon his level than for him to lower himself 
to their level. This is a maxim which might well be fol- 
lowed by many men who are not school superintendents but 
who desire to influence others. 
In case members of the board desire the superintendent 
to make a nomination or recommendation which he cannot 
conscientiously make, he does not need to assume yust be 
that their motives are wrong, and that they are Firm but 
dishonest people, trying to lead him into iniquity. Courteous. 
He does not need to rise in his might and square off for 
battle. It is entirely possible in most cases to decline to 
make an improper recommendation or nomination without 
antagonizing the one who asks it. This should be done 
by appealing to the higher nature of the member of the board 
and putting the responsibility and the onus upon him. 
Politicians, as a rule, respect men who have convictions and 
who are ready to stand for them, and yielding to an improper 
suggestion does not win friends, even when it is done for 
that purpose. But in refusing to yield it is not necessary
-P-A-G-E-174
  166 The School and Its Life 
to knock down the people who have made the suggestions. 
So much for the personal relations of the superintendent 
with his board. 
Officially, he should never lose his grip. He should 
never let the board feel that he is not to be reckoned with 
Should be in regard to any proposition affecting the educa- 
Tactful. tion of the children, and yet he should let the 
members feel that they are people of consequence, and that 
they are as deeply interested in the cause of education as he 
is and are doing something for it. A tactful superintendent 
will frequently make a suggestion to a member of the board 
in such a way that he himself will propose the very reform 
that the superintendent seeks. Superintendents often err in 
their desire to have it evident that all the reforms and all the 
good movements spring from them. It is sometimes better 
to have them apparently spring from the board itself. It 
is often wise for the superintendent to fall in sweetly with 
the suggestion of a member of the board and say nothing 
about the fact that the suggestion was his originally. 
The superintendent should treat with respect every sug- 
gestion from members of the board, and if he cannot agree 
with them, he should be at infinite pains to make his reasons 
plain, and to convince them that the suggestions are not 
feasible. Sometimes it is best to yield in minor matters, 
even if the measures proposed are contrary to his judgment, 
in order to hold control in major matters. 
That superintendent has done well in managing his board 
to whom the members will come for advice and suggestion 
before bringing a project forward in meeting. That is the 
ideal relation —that of friend and counsellor, as well as 
executive of the board. The members should feel that the 
board, as an official body, is responsible to the people, and
-P-A-G-E-175
  The School Superintendent (Continued) 167 
the superintendent should do all in his power to stimulate 
that feeling instead of seeking to make them feel that they 
are responsible for nothing and that he is responsible for 
everything. 
From this it follows that almost the first duty of every 
superintendent is to educate his board. He should begin 
this and persist systematically. The persistence must 
is particularly important, inasmuch as the mem- Educate 
bership of school boards is constantly changing, *e Board. 
and the superintendent who has a well-educated board to-day, 
may find himself with an awkward team to-morrow, and 
sometimes with a vicious one. He should educate the board, 
first of all, to faith in himself. It is this faith in him as a 
man that will make it possible for him to accomplish his 
ends with the least friction and with the greatest certainty. 
This means that he should always be thoroughly honest. 
No matter though the members of a board be corrupt, 
a superintendent cannot afford to be dishonest Must be 
with them. He must be tactful and diplomatic, Honest. 
but not crooked. They must come to feel after acquaintance 
with him that he is wholly sincere in all the measures he 
brings forward; that he has only the good of the schools at 
heart; and that when he makes a recommendation they need 
not look for any ulterior motive. That is the first step. 
The second is to convince them that the recommenda- 
tions are in the main wise, backed by sound educational 
doctrine, and likely to result in good. If the superintend- 
ent can keep his board in such an attitude, he has before 
him a clear field, but he should not rest contented with this. 
He should seek to make his board intelligent, at least as to 
the superficial aspects of educational doctrine. He should 
keep them constantly informed of what he is about to do
-P-A-G-E-176
  168 The School and Its Life 
and his reasons for it; they will like it, and he will find his 
strongest support coming from the members of the board 
that he has thus instructed. 
These points of advice may seem unnecessary, but they are 
not. More superintendents fail because they have not taken 
the board of education into their confidence and have not 
inspired the confidence of its members than from almost any 
other reason. This is quite true of some of the stronger 
and abler superintendents who do not get along well with 
their boards. Sometimes the loss of his position by a really 
able superintendent may be traced to a lack of tact on his 
part in failing to educate the board into a condition of con- 
fidence in him, and many inferior superintendents who have 
not the confidence of intelligent teachers or of their con- 
fréres, are strong in their positions because they have trained 
their boards to support them. 
Another suggestion with regard to the official relations 
of the superintendent towards his board is this: He should

done at some future time. But when a superintendent goes 
before his board with a statement of what he wants, he 
should know to the utmost detail what that want is, and 
he should be able to defend his proposition accurately 
and minutely against opposition from the board or from 
other sources. Loose recommendations soon forfeit the 
superintendent’s position of strength. This is equally true 
whether they relate to financial matters, to the course of 
study, or to the appointment of teachers.
-P-A-G-E-177
The School Superintendent (Continued) 169 
While the personality of the superintendent is a matter 
of such consequence, do not let me be understood as advo- 
cating reliance upon that alone. If there are no statutes 
controlling the appointment of teachers, for instance, a wise 
superintendent will secure from the board of education 
formal regulations upon these matters at the earliest possi- 
ble moment. He needs these for his own protection. It is 
always a source of strength for him to be able to say to his 
board whenever an improper suggestion is made, “If you 
do that you will violate your own rules.”” While the super- 
intendent should formulate the rules, he should have the 
board adopt them as their own. I knew a school system to 
be practically revolutionized by a tactful superintendent, who 
simply secured the adoption of stringent regulations during 
the early days of his superintendency. These rules the board 
could not consistently violate, even though they interfered 
with the assumed prerogative of its members in securing the 
appointment of teachers.
-P-A-G-E-178
CHAPTER XVIII 
THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE TEACHERS 
In the preceding chapter the extra-official relations of 
the superintendent with his board were treated at some 
length. He has other relations not nominated in the bond, 
with other people, which are no less important than those 
with the board. Indeed, I trust that it has been made clear 
that these extra-official relations are of very great con- 
sequence, and that their character often determines the 
success or failure of the superintendent. The school super- 
intendent who manages his schools from his office, no matter 
how well organized his office may be, and who expects to 
secure educational results by giving orders, even though 
these orders be practically perfect in wisdom and in manner, 
is doomed to disappointment. 
When we attain the ideal school system, we shall have 
Doctor Tompkins’s definition of a school, viz., “a spiritual 
relation,” expanded to include the whole system. For if we 
admit that the ultimate purpose of school organization is the 
spiritual growth of the young, and that it is to be brought 
about through a personal relation between the teacher 
and the pupil, we must, in logic, admit that if there are 
other people directly concerned in the cause of education, 
as, for instance, in guiding and instructing the teachers 
themselves, those other persons must enter into similar rela- 
tions with the teachers. The psychological reasons for such 
170
-P-A-G-E-179
  The Superintendent and the Teachers 171 
relations with members of the board have already been 
considered, and we shall later consider the sociological rea- 
sons for such relations with other people. 
Now as to the superintendent and the teachers: It is 
evident that the character of the superintendent’s relations 
with his teachers must vary largely with the com- potations 
munity, especially with its size. In a small city, wit vary 
with only a few schools, the superintendent can with Size 
know personally every teacher and can establish he 
relations with them all, resembling the proper : 
relations between the teacher and his pupils, such as shall 
bring about the kind of teaching that he wants in the true 
way, which is the way of sympathy and harmony. 
In cities of larger size the relations must necessarily be 
different. In a city of the intermediate class, from 100,000 
to 300,000 in population, the superintendent can know most, 
or all, of his teachers by name and face, and a few of them 
personally quite well, and that is practically the limit of 
possibility. In the larger cities, those of more than 300,009, 
the superintendent cannot know many of his teachers at 
all personally, and in the very largest cities, such as New 
York, Chicago, Philadelphia, he cannot know in any satis- 
factory way even all of his principals. And yet I am con- 
vinced that the sort of personal relations of which I have 
spoken, and which I deem essential to the best administra- 
tion of schools, may be maintained by the supervising force 
in any city, no matter how many millions of people its in- 
habitants are. 
So let us consider first the character of these relations, 
and let it be assumed that if the city is too large for the 
superintendent himself to maintain them, they will be main- 
tained by some other representative of the Department of
-P-A-G-E-180
  172 The School and Its Life 
Supervision, and that although the superintendent’s personal 
relations are with an increasingly limited number of teachers, 
they will be in every case with those who themselves must 
influence others. 
It must be evident to all readers that we now are con- 
sidering the subtler, more spiritual and higher functions 
of the supervising force, and not especially the judicial and 
executive functions, though there is no necessary conflict 
between the two. If the superintendent holds himself 
aloof from his body politic, particularly from that portion 
with which it is possible for him to be in immediate, personal 
contact, in order that he may be an unfeeling and unbiased 
judge, he will fail of the very end he has in mind, and he 
will have exalted into a position of supreme importance 
that function which is not properly supreme. 
It is true that the superintendent must perform in an 
absolutely impartial way his judicial and executive duties, 
but these, important as they are, are not his chief duties. 
I am aware that some superintendents will not agree with 
me at this point, but my primary contention must be kept 
in mind — that teaching is a spiritual process; that only 
those teach well who are in spiritual rapport with the taught, 
and are employing both material and method which they 
believe will be spiritually effective. 
A forced and driven corps of teachers, whether yielding 
mechanically, or whether cherishing in their hearts rebellion, 
s will make a failure of the most philosophical, com- ympa- f 3 3 thetic Re- Plete, and wise course of study. It is said of the 
lations with teachers of one of our greatest cities that they em- 
Teachers Joy their time chiefly in efforts to evade the Necessary. é requirements of the course of study, and yet the 
administration of this city is strong, vigorous, and relentless,
-P-A-G-E-181
  The Superintendent and the Teachers 173 
wholly, and it almost appears of intention, unsympathetic. 
The evil of such a state of things is evident. Teachers, not 
only not believing heartily in what they are doing and not 
understanding the underlying principles and purpose of it 
all, but actually antagonistic and seeking how best not to do 
it and at the same time keep out of trouble, cannot teach 
well. The work is sure to be badly done, and the course of 
study will fail to justify itself in the minds of those who are 
observing it, not because it is bad, but because it is badly 
administered, and this in spite of the fact that the adminis- 
trative department is wonderfully strong and able. 
What is needed in that and in other cities where like 
conditions prevail? Two things. The first is official and 
includes careful, persistent, and patient instruction in the 
educational principles underlying the course of study, in the 
course itself as exemplifying these principles, and in the 
methods of carrying it out so as to produce the best results. 
The second is extra-official and personal. 
Teachers, like other people, are controlled by their feel- 
ings more than by their judgment. It would certainly be 
ungracious to say that this may be partly due to the fact 
that the great majority of them are women, and I am not 
sure that that has anything to do with the case. If it 
has, it is more than offset by the fact that women, as a 
tule, are more open-minded and more willing to accept 
new ideas than men are. And when their faith is aroused 
and they begin to work con amore, nothing is too diffi- 
cult for them, neither effort of preparation, nor effort of 
execution. 
More sincere approval of the course of study and of the 
efforts of the administration to improve the schools in any 
city will be brought about if the superintendent will enter

vastly better work will be done everywhere. 
It is to be borne in mind, too, as has been said repeatedly, 
that the wisdom is not all with the superintendent; that 
Aloofness teachers are at least reasonable beings; that many 
nota Proof of them know quite as much of the principles of 
of Dignity. education as the superintendent, and some of 
them probably more; and in any case that often the super- 
intendent is himself a mere accident, selected from his fellows 
for causes that are not apparent except to the initiated. 
But even if he is superior intellectually and professionally 
to the body of teachers, that fact will not be made manifest 
by any degree of aloofness, but rather by close personal 
relations. If he is not so superior, his aloofness will simply 
bring him into dislike and possible ridicule. I have known of 
more than one instance of teachers and principals who were 
not convinced of the wisdom of the plans of the superintend- 
ent, but were willing to undertake to carry them out sincerely 
and open-mindedly, simply because of their personal re- 
spect and liking for him and their desire to please, and in 
all of these cases they were ultimately converted to his way 
of thinking, because they had worked with open ‘minds. 
Whereas, if their personal attitude toward the superintend- 
ent had been other than it was, their attitude of mind toward 
the work they were doing would have been so totally different 
as to make it impossible for them to see the new light. 
Doubtless there is need of caution, and in instances there 
is danger in close personal relations between the superintend-
-P-A-G-E-183
  <Th Superintendent and the Teachers 175 
ent and his ‘subordinates, but that is almost invariably due 
to some weakness on his part — either weakness of judg- 
ment or weakness of character. Familiarity breeds contempt 
only with the contemptible; it breeds respect with those 
worthy of it. The real leader is manifest in a throng, and 
he does not need a dais, a throne, and a robe to make his 
leadership manifest. But let us consider some of the cau- 
tions that are evidently needed. 
The personal relations never should become a weak lean- 
ing of the higher upon the lower. The official should always 
maintain such an attitude that he can discipline >, 
when necessary. In other words, the harmony Official 
should not rest upon favors sought from or be- Superior 
stowed by subordinates. The superintendent ae In:

cal place, has weakened his power to discipline those whom 
he has thus called upon, and it is quite likely that they will 
take advantage of the hold they thus have gained. The 
superintendent should be the recipient of whatever gratitude 
arises from favors done, as well as of the abuse which too 
commonly follows favors. Yet, in so far as is possible, the 
relation should be human and not official. 
The superintendent should be careful also not to have 
particular intimates among his subordinates to the Special 
exclusion of others. Naturally his personal rela- Intimacies

that others have the superintendent’s ear to his exclusion. 
All should feel that they can come to him and find a 
sympathetic listener, whether they wish to seek help, to 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
176 The School and Its Life 
narrate incidents, or to give encouragement, or even advice. 
Above all things, the superintendent should avoid a “kitchen 
cabinet” and every form of clique. He must not enter 
into such relations with any small fraction of his subordinate 
force as to lead the others to think that they are discrimi- 
nated against or regarded less highly, and he must be espe- 
cially careful not to make more warmly welcome than others 
those who come to him with flattery and adulation. If the 
superintendent can enter into such personal relations with 
his subordinates that they can talk over a situation or a new 
plan with him frankly and fully, stating objections and diffi- 
culties as plainly as if the scheme were their own, he has 
accomplished much, and is in a position to accomplish much 
more. 
Itis surprising how much of red tape, even, will be ren- 
dered unnecessary if people feel aright. Suppose every

with the utmost zeal and faith — the schools of that system 
. would bound to the front with a speed unparalleled and 
undreamed of. Now such a state of things, of course, is 
not wholly possible, but it may be realized approximately, 
in small systems quite readily, and to a considerable degree 
even in the very largest, by extension of personal influence; 
by the recognition of the fact that teachers are, first of 
all, human beings of a good sort, who are, however, con- 
trolled more largely by their sympathies and their feelings 
than by their intellects; and by the further recognition of 
the fact that the best way to the control of the intellect is 
commonly through the emotions. With all this, the super- 
intendent must appear even, strong, impartial, with ready
-P-A-G-E-185
The Superintendent and the Teachers 177 
sympathy alike for all, having many likes, but very few or 
no apparent dislikes. 
The lower reasons for this sort of thing are the same 
as apply in dealing with the school board. Material 
success is better secured through human sympathy than 
through force, but this lower motive is not the main motive. 
Teachers are worthy of this personal recognition; they are 
not “hands”; they are not parts of a machine; they are men 
and women of culture and character, for the most part, and 
should be treated with the warm, sympathetic confidence 
which will bring out the best that is in them. 
This argument takes for granted that there is some one 
in the administrative force whose duty it is to help make 
teachers better. This involves not merely in- ‘ Siete In Large struction, but inspiration and personal counsel. Gities the

The superintendent should be the personal in- ee 
spiration, counselor, and guide of as large a group : 
of people as it is possible for him to come into personal contact 
with; in very large cities, possibly no more than the associate 
and subordinate superintendents and supervisors. In most 
cities it is possible for him to hold such relations, at least with 
school principals. In the smaller cities, he can hold them 
with the school principals and some of the teachers, and in 
the quite small cities with all. But even in the larger cities 
the inspiration received from the superintendent should be 
extended downward. 
An inspirational force is absolutely necessary for the cul- 
tivation of esprit de corps and for the securing of the best 
kind of spiritual work in the schools. In the large cities the 
associate superintendents, district superintendents, or super-
-P-A-G-E-186
  178 The School and Its Life 
visors — that is, the immediate subordinates of the super- 
intendent of schools, by whatever name they may be called 
— should constitute such an inspirational force, and should 
exert their influence upon those within their field, ordinarily 
both teachers and principals — certainly upon principals. 
This function should be exercised before that of judge or 
disciplinarian. 
We must never lose sight of the fact that the great busi- 
ness of the supervising force is to help the teachers teach, 
and not simply to pass upon them; that unless the super- 
vising force makes it easier for the teachers to teach well, 
helps them, guides them, stimulates them, inspires them, it 
fails of its highest function. The young teacher, the dis- 
couraged teacher, the teacher who does not understand 
what the methods or the meanings of the course of study 
are, should have some one belonging to the administration 
in sympathy with its purpose and spirit to whom he can go 
and expose his difficulties with full confidence of friendly 
consideration and kindly help.

harm by going about from school to school and carrying

CHAPTER XIX 
SoctaL FUNCTIONS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT 
BrrorE passing from the school superintendent, it 
seems worth while to consider briefly his social functions. 
This does not mean attendance upon afternoon teas, pro- 
gressive euchre parties, or evening receptions, although 
these may be proper and even important gatherings for 
him to attend. But it refers to the superintendent as a 
factor in the community life—a prominent figure in 
all public movements and public gatherings which are 
influential in furthering the aims for which society is 
organized. : 
Theoretically, no man is in a better position to serve the 
public in such capacity than the school superintendent. He 
is the schoolmaster of his town epitomized. He o..09). 
represents in his own person, or should represent, master 
the educational forces and the intellectual ideals Represents 
of the community. The old trinity of intellectual raha: 
influence in the community — the minister, the fi 
squire, and the doctor — was long ago enlarged by the ad- 
dition of the schoolmaster, and he has been for years a grow- 
ing figure, somewhat eclipsing the others. 
The squire is but a ghost, and the lawyer, who has taken 
his place, is not because of his profession necessarily an 
influential figure. The doctor has in most cases ceased to 
try to be a public character. The minister still occasionally 
181
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 The School and Its Life 
tries to be, sometimes with disastrous effect to himself and 
his sacred cause. 
Their places have been taken by the professional reformer, 
the man who is at the head of the Chamber of Commerce, 
the Board of Trade, or other semi-public body, and, in a 
way, the politician, especially as represented by the mayor. 
But no one of these can fill the place as well as can the school- 
master. He is really, as represented by the superintendent, 
sole heir to the old intellectual forces which were such fer se. 
If he uses his opportunity, if he makes even a feeble attempt 
to use it, he is sure to be awarded a chance to exert a wiser 
and more wholesome influence than any other single man 
in the community. His counsel will be sought, and when 
obtained will be valued, unless, by some foolish course, he 
lowers his own standard. The general tendency of the 
better element in every community is to look up to the super 
intendent of schools and to put him forward to the full 
measure of his ability, and often beyond it. 
Now, in view of this change in attitude, and of the vast 
- opportunity which it has given the school superintendent, 
what ought he to be as a public man aside from his work 
of superintending education ? 
He should educate the public in education. This does 
not mean simply that he should be a lecturer upon paideutics, 
: though that is doubtless one of his proper and Superin- Fs 
tendent | Hecessary offices, but it means that he should 
should take within his sympathies and comprehension 
Educate all organizations and plans that make for the in- 
the Ruble, tellectual and moral betterment of the community. 
That is, he should take a large view of education. 
Technically, the superintendent’s duties are limited to 
the management of the public schools, but we have not yet

Social Functions of the Superintendent 183 
arrived at a very clear notion of the limits of this manage- 
ment, or of what should be included within the purview 
and control of the public school authorities; but if we accept 
the common, limited view of their office, we must not accept 
this as defining the superintendent’s field of activities. He 
should be the active codrdinating force to bring into harmony 
and to unify, in so far as unity is desirable, all those agencies 
which are operated under the auspices of philanthropic and 
ecclesiastical bodies for the common education. 
There is much waste in all communities, and, in general, 
a lack of coérdination among well-meaning people whe are 
working for the same ends, but not together. 
What, then, should the school superintendent do beyond 
the actual supervision of schools? 
First, what should he not do? He should not engage in 
any political strife, and that means more than partisan 
politics. He should not take sides upon questions gy ouig 
that do not directly concern his educational work, Avoid 
even though he may be greatly interested in the Partisan- 
outcome. There are many interests in which it S™i?- 
is possible for the superintendent to mingle without stirring up 
strife, and all others he should eschew. It is true, a superin- 
tendent is a citizen and should exercise his rights as a citizen; 
should vote and do what else he can for the political cause in 
which he believes, but without taking an active or an offen- 
sive part. Let it be borne in mind that if he is to be a har- 
monizer and organizer of educational forcesin the community, 
he must win the confidence of all parties and be on good 
terms with all. Most social, and very many political, con- 
troversies are wholly unnecessary, and are due to the inability 
of people to understand one another’s views and to the un- 
conscious belief that they have in their own inerrancy.  
-P-A-G-E-192
  184 The School and Its Life 
These controversies unfortunately often occur in attempts 
to bring about moral and political reforms. These the school 
superintendent should keep out of. He should also keep out 
of religious controversies. Of course it is his privilege, as it 
is that of every man, to go to the church of his own faith and 
to work in it, but not to take part in controversies with people 
of other faiths or of no faith. He should never be partisan 
excepting on behalf of the best things in his own immediate, 
technical field, but he should be active, in so far as possible, in 
philanthropic, literary, and scientific organizations, and also 
in important social bodies, such as clubs of the best sort.

said: “TI suppose he has never belonged to a social club and 
would hardly know what to do in one.” He did not over- 
state it. Such a superintendent is always in danger because 
of his lack of ability to assimilate and his failure to recog- 
nize the importance of other things than his own school- 
masterly duties. It is said of him that he is a mere school- 
master, and it is said in reproach by people who would like 
to have him something more.

-P-A-G-E-193
Social Functions of the Superintendent 185 
social bodies, membership in which is not inconsistent with 
professional dignity or with good standing in the community; 
to be active in organizations for educating the 9.0.14 Em- 
public in art, in literature, in music; for securing brace All 
and maintaining courses of lectures, libraries, Educational 
and concerts; to be especially active in broad Me#2s- 
philanthropic organizations, whether upon a religious or a 
secular basis, provided they are not controversial; to seek 
to bring the various organizations into proper relations with 
one another, and to magnify their usefulness in every way 
possible, particularly by bringing them into harmony with 
his own important work of public education. 
The superintendent who does this accomplishes much 
by it. He makes life more worth living for himself; he be- 
comes a larger man because of his broadened interests. It 
makes him a better superintendent; he better understands 
public needs and what he really ought to do for the schools. 
Too many school superintendents are limited to the purely 
professional view of their work, and often they go far astray 
in gauging public need. School people sometimes seem 
unwilling to admit that the parent has any special rights 
in regard to the education of his children by the public, or 
that he knows anything about it. The superintendent who 
comes in contact with many classes of people is not so likely 
to make this mistake. He not only magnifies himself as a 
man, he makes himself vastly more useful. He brings to 
the help of various good organizations his own technical 
skill and his wisdom as an administrator of education, and 
most philanthropic and social institutions need just such 
help and welcome it. The average eleemosynary institution 
is badly managed because there is no one connected with it 
who knows how. This is true also of a great many literary, 
   
-P-A-G-E-194
  186 The School and Its Life 
scientific, and social organizations of the better sort. The 
superintendent’s help is most valuable, it is always welcome, 
and the rendering of it makes him a more useful man. 
But above and beyond all this, the superintendent of 
schools who recognizes the whole field of education as his, 
His and attempts to till it, strengthens his own specific 
Position | work enormously. He brings to his support the 
Strength- best forces in the community, and in time of stress, 
ned when, for example, his educational theories are 
attacked, he finds it of the very greatest value to have 
such support. In no department of society have we got 
beyond the recognition of the personal equation — the man 
counts for more than his doctrine, always. The school 
superintendent who is, as he should be, in advance of his 
community, and who is, as he should be, continually bring- 
ing new things into the schools, endeavoring to improve 
them in the light of modern thought and discovery, is sure 
to be set upon by those parents and citizens who are satisfied 
with the old, and who measure the kind of training their 
children are receiving by the kind they themselves received 
when children. It is astonishing how many people are so 
well satisfied with themselves and their own training that 
they gauge all progress in matters of education and religion 
by themselves. This is perhaps the greatest obstacle the 
school superintendent meets in his attempts at progress. 
Now, if he is a mere schoolmaster, limiting his field of 
activities to his office and the schoolroom, comparatively 
unknown in the community, even if he has formulated many 
admirable reports, proving incontrovertibly that his inno- 
vations are wise, the public is likely to reject them; but if 
the people know him, know his spirit and know him to be 
a wise and sensible man, when he says that some new
-P-A-G-E-195
  Social Functions of the Superintendent 187 
measure is good, they believe him. A few minutes’ personal 
talk with a few of the “best people,” the most influential 
citizens, by the superintendent who has their confidence, will 
do more to pave the way for possible reforms than all of the 
articles that he may write and publish. Because, after all, 
the public will stand by a person rather than a theory, and 
the superintendent owes it to himself, owes it to his schools, 
and owes it to his school board, to put himself in such a 
position in the community that the citizens will be ready to 
stand by him, even when they do not fully understand what 
he is driving at. 
There are other means than those mentioned by which 
the superintendent of schools may make himself an important 
factor in the community and may strengthen his should Use 
own hands as school superintendent. One is the the Press. 
proper use of the press. The editors of the leading news- 
papers in all of our towns are usually men of more than 
ordinary intelligence and anxious for the public welfare. If 
they can be made to see that the school superintendent is the 
right man for his place, and that what he is doing is best 
for his schools, they will usually be willing to support him. 
The superintendent of schools should make it a point to 
know personally, not merely the reporters, but the editors 
of papers, and first of all, the editors-in-chief, because no 
department of business, so far as I know, has its whole policy 
so entirely controlled by one man as the newspaper. He 
should also know the city editor and be on pleasant terms 
with him, and if he has a new scheme that is likely to be 
misunderstood, he should be at pains to explain it personally 
to these men before it goes to the public. In all my experi- 
ence as a school superintendent I have never yet known an 
editor who was not willing, and even eager, to listen to all
-P-A-G-E-196
  188 The School and Its Life 
I had to say to him upon educational subjects, and if he 
was convinced of its propriety, perfectly willing to support 
my scheme to the extent of his ability. I have always found 
it safe to let the editor-in-chief know what I had in mind, 
even before I published it, so that he might be armed when 
the time came, and never in but one instance have I known 
this trust to be taken advantage of and premature publica- 
tion to ensue. 
Newspaper editorial support is a very desirable thing. In 
general, if the superintendent cannot convince the editors 
of important papers that he is, in the main, right, a fair con- 
clusion is that he is at least partially wrong. Further, in 
discussing with men who have as many possible points of 
view as a newspaper editor, the school superintendent himself 
is likely to get much light, if he keeps the windows open. 
Another possible, and wholly proper, means of influ- 
encing the public is through public addresses. It is true 
Should Use that some school men are not happy in making 
the Public addresses, but most men who believe in anything 
Platform. earnestly, and are sufficiently intelligent to be 
school superintendents, can express their views in an effec- 
tive, if not attractive way. I recall now one school super- 
intendent of mature years, who, like Demosthenes, overcame 
the greatest difficulties in order that he might be a good 
public speaker, and thus fulfil one of his proper functions 
in the community, and he succeeded remarkably well. 
There are many occasions upon which the school super- 
intendent, if he will and if he has the talent, can address the 
public upon educational topics. He is sure to be invited 
to make addresses before bodies of various sorts, and usually 
is expected to give an educational trend to his talk. Par- 
ents’ organizations in connection with the schools offer per-
-P-A-G-E-197
  
Social Functions of the Superintendent 189 
haps his richest field, but his opportunities are not limited 
to such organizations. Church functions, banquets of all 
kinds, and gatherings of various organizations, give him 
audiences, and he is an unwise superintendent who does not 
attempt to improve such occasions. It is a mistake to claim 
pressure of professional duties. These are professional duties 
of the highest order to one who takes the proper view of his 
profession. 
Education is the whole of life. Naturally, the super- 
intendent cannot control the whole of life, but he can aid 
its development. There are very many organized educative 
forces in the community besides schools, and the proper 
view is that they should all work together with the schools. 
Much of the very best work is done under philanthropic 
impulse, and the tendency to turn such beneficent institu- 
tions over to the control of the state is to be regretted. 
The superintendent of schools who insists that other 
educational institutions, to receive aid from him, must come 
under his control and that of the school system, is likely 
to destroy sympathy and weaken the philanthropic impulse 
in the community, and while he may make an apparently 
more perfect machine, he really fails to accomplish the ends 
of such organizations as well as if he were to encourage 
independence. 
The superintendent, then, should regard all education as 
his field, and should be ready not so much to absorb all 
educational institutions, as to extend himself to them with 
a helpful spirit. He should be the most prominent as well 
as the most useful man in the community in all matters 
which are, within the broadest possible scope of the term, 
educational.

  CHAPTER XX 
THE SUPERVISOR AND TEACHER OF “SPECIAL” SUBJECTS 
THERE is one phase of supervision that presents diffi- 
culties so far unsolved. I know of no satisfactory literature 
upon the subject, which is doubtless due to the fact that the 
problem has nowhere, so far as I know, been satisfactorily 
adjusted. I refer to the problem of those who are assigned 
to what are known as “ special ” subjects, in the capacity 
of supervisor or special teacher. 
With the rapid expansion of the curriculum, many sub- 
jects have come into the schools which at first the regular 
Difficulties Class teachers were not able to teach properly, 
-of the and some of which they doubtless cannot now 
“Special.” teach properly. At least, the custom has be- 
come quite general of putting instruction in manual training 
exercises of all sorts, and drawing, music, and nature study, 
into the hands of specialists; that is, those who are supposed 
to have thorough acquaintance with these subjects, and who, 
theoretically at least, have received training in the art of 
teaching them. These specialists have come in by the side 
door, as it were. They are not class teachers; their authority 
is not clearly defined, and their work is not closely coérdi- 
nated with the work of the schools, so that in most school 
systems much confusion has arisen in these departments. 
In some cases serious friction has occurred between the 
specialists and the regular teachers. 
190
-P-A-G-E-199
The Supervisor and the Special Teacher IgI 
Two radical remedies might be suggested: One, to do away 
with the special teachers altogether and require the class- 
room teachers to teach all the special subjects; and the other, 
to organize the schools on a departmental basis, with all 
teachers practically special teachers, moving about and 
teaching their subjects to different classes. The depart- 
mental system has been discussed fully in Chapter VI. 
As to the first suggested remedy, it is doubtless true that 
if the class-room teachers are reasonably well prepared to 
teach the special subjects, it is much better to Ctass- 
have them do it than to have special teachers Room 
come into the schoolroom, but it is also true aoe 
that many teachers cannot teach some of the ae 
special subjects which a modern course of study “Special” 
demands. The number of teachers, however, Subjects. 
who can teach all the subjects is steadily increasing, and the 
number of subjects that most of the teachers can teach is 
also increasing. 
It is now seldom necessary to have special teachers for 
either music or drawing. The Normal Schools and Teachers’ 
Training Schools of all sorts supply such adequate training 
that their graduates can usually teach these subjects under 
expert and proper supervision reasonably well. It is true 
there are still some who cannot teach one or both of them, 
but a wise distribution of the teachers will make it easy to 
care for the few special cases. 
It is to be remembered that since these subjects were 
introduced a steady course of training has gone on not merely 
in the special schools, but in teachers’ meetings and classes 
conducted by supervisors and specially trained teachers, in 
all or nearly all of our school systems. There are still, 
however, some subjects which are coming more and more
-P-A-G-E-200
  192 The School and Its Life 
into the schools, that the average teacher cannot teach well. 
Perhaps the most conspicuous of these just now is manual 
training in its various forms. ‘“ Nature study” is in a 
transitional state; more teachers can teach it well than for- 
merly, but there are still many who feel very weak and whose 
instruction is not highly edifying. ‘Nature study,” how- 
ever, is one of the special subjects that more than any other 
should be taught by the regular class teacher and carefully 
coérdinated with the other subjects. 
In none of the special subjects — not even music or draw- 
ing—is it possible to get along without expert supervision; 
Expert that is, teachers are not as well grounded in music 
Supervision and drawing as they are in arithmetic and gram- 
Necessary. mar or other subjects of the curriculum, nor are 
the general supervisory officers as competent to give super- 
vision; so that we must confess that for a long time to come 
there will of necessity be subjects in our course of study, 
that may be called “special,” requiring teachers who must 
also be called “special,” to give some or all of the instruction 
in these subjects. And it is quite certain that for an in- 
definite time it will be necessary to have at least expert 
supervision in these special subjects, so that neither of the 
plans suggested can be counted upon to solve-the difficulty 
of the specialist. He cannot be obliterated; he must be 
coérdinated with the system. 
The present arrangement prevailing in most places is 
wretchedly bad. The specialists are viewed with distrust, 
and often with dislike, by the regular teacher. They upset 
programmes and disturb the order of the school, and often 
greatly add to the disciplinary troubles of the teacher. Some- 
times, too, they seriously embarrass the situation, if they are 
good teachers of their special subjects, by leaving the class
-P-A-G-E-201
  
The Supervisor and the Special Teacher 193 
teacher, who must be constantly with the children, in a very 
unfavorable light. These difficulties are not universal. In 
a few cases wise supervision and common sense on the part 
of the special teacher, or supervisor, or both, has partially 
solved them. 
THE SPECIAL TEACHER 
First let us consider the special teacher, the teacher who 
goes regularly to the class-rooms and gives instruction to 
the pupils in some one or more of these special subjects. 
His problem is really much simpler than that of the super- 
visor. His business is to go and teach, and not to supervise 
nor direct the regular teacher. If the instruction is given 
in the regular class-room with the pupils all present, the 
teacher should also be present in order to aid the special 
teacher, particularly in dealing with individual pupils, and 
if necessary, in keeping order, and also that he may learn 
as much as possible of the subject himself, for the ideal to be 
looked forward to by all is the teaching of these aioe by 
the class-room teachers. 
The special teacher needs simply ordinary tact and com- 
mon sense. Assumption of superiority to the class-room 
teacher and all indifference to the other work yout not 
should be absolutely banished. The special Assume Su- 
teacher should seek to help the class teacher in Periority. 
coérdinating all phases of the work; should study the pos- 
sibilities of correlation, and should in every way try to be 
helpful though not in any sense officious. Some special 
teachers are always welcomed, both by the class teacher and 
by the children, while some are not, and it is simply a ques- 
tion of tact and personality.
-P-A-G-E-202
  194 The School and Its Life 
THE SUPERVISOR 
Second, the supervisor: This problem is very different 
indeed from that of the special teacher, because the super- 
visor of special subjects is a supervisory officer, usually 
with undefined power. He is not a superintendent and 
he is not a general supervisor. He is responsible to the 
superintendent for the instruction in his subject as it is 
given in the schools, but the question whether he is 
superior to the principal is a mooted one and always 
rising. 
Is he to give his instruction to the teachers directly, disre- 
garding the principal? If so, how can the principal be held 
responsible for the conduct of his school? Is he to give his 
instruction to the principal and let the principal give it to 
his teachers? If so, in the case of a technical subject, how 
can the supervisor be sure that it is correctly given to the 
teachers? If he gives the orders to the teachers, how can he 
be sure that he is not violating some order that has already 
been given by the principal? If the principal is the respon- 
sible head of the school, is the supervisor responsible to him 
for the instruction in his department in the school, or to some 
one outside of the school? And if to some one outside, how 
is the principal the responsible head of the school? What 
is the teacher to do after receiving contradictory or inhar- 
monious orders from the supervisor and the principal? Is 
it to be understood in all cases that the instruction of the 
supervisor is the instruction of the superintendent? IE so, 
can any subordinate official dispute it? If not, how can 
the superintendent enforce it? Is the supervisor to serve 
as a “buffer” between the superintendent and the public 
so that if the work is complained of in any department,
-P-A-G-E-203
  The Supervisor and the Special Teacher 195 
particularly if “fads” are denounced, he can hide himself 
behind the skirts of the supervisor? 
These are some of the very practical questions which 
every one connected with a school system that has special 
teachers and supervisors will recognize, and while they can- 
not be answered finally here, a few suggestions may help 
the superintendents themselves towards a solution. Of 
course an easy answer, and a pretty reliable one, is that 
common sense will solve the difficulty in each specific case, 
but not all people have common sense, and a certain amount 
of organization is made necessary by this very lack. 
A supervisor’s instruction in a special subject should 
always be recognized as that of the superintendent of schools. 
If this is done it will greatly simplify the problem, Gpenrioe 
but that this may be done some conditions need Represents 
to be met. the Super- 
The superintendent must keep in the very imtendent. 
closest touch with the supervisors. He must know what 
the supervisor’s plans are and what sort of instruction he is 
giving to the teachers; and the supervisor should under- 
stand that no instructions involving changes in plan or 
important considerations of policy may be given by him 
without first having received the approval of the superin- 
tendent. If it is understood by the teaching corps, the prin- 
cipal included, that every supervisor on visiting the school 
is an authoritatively recognized representative of the superin- 
tendent, the attitude of the teachers and principal toward the 
supervisor is easily determined. But if the supervisor gives 
instruction about which the superintendent does not know — 
hoes his own row independently of the rest of the force — 
constant confusion will arise and the superintendent will 
be called upon to support that about which he does not
-P-A-G-E-204
  196 The School and Its Life 
know, or will be compelled to withdraw his support, which 
will be disastrous to the supervisor. 
Not only must the supervisor be in close and sympathetic 
touch with the superintendent so that he can positively and 
with confidence represent him, but he must also recognize 
the position of the principal in the school. The supervisor, 
or superintendent for that matter, who comes ruthlessly 
into the school and gives general or specific instructions to 
teachers without the knowledge or approval of the school prin- 
cipal, is sowing the seeds of dissension and dissatisfaction. 
It should be the business of the supervisor, as of the 
superintendent, when visiting a school to talk very plainly 
eireniac with the principal about the situation, and if any 
should new instruction of consequence is to be given, any 
Recognize new policy outlined, it should be made plain to 
Principal. the principal, and if possible, the principal’s 
hearty and willing co-operation should be secured.\ If this 
attitude is taken, and the supervisor recognizes the prin- 
cipal as the head of his school and gives his orders, if he 
gives orders, or advice, if he gives advice, first to the prin- 
cipal and then to the teachers in so far as necessary, the 
principal can be held responsible for the work, and also for 
his attitude toward the supervisor. 
Naturally, much instruction of a technical and detailed 
sort must be given by the supervisor in visiting schoolrooms, 
which does not need to be filtered through the principal, 
but such instruction should be fully in harmony with general 
principles already laid down, either by the supervisor in 
conference with the principal, or by the supervisor or super- 
intendent, in a meeting, or by syllabi. Much time can be 
saved by making proper use of the various meetings of the 
supervisory officers with the teachers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  The Supervisor and the Special Teacher 197 
One serious difficulty in this connection often is the un- 
willingness of the principals to put themselves into the proper 
attitude toward special work. Principals should Principals 
be invited and urged to attend meetings in which ghould At- 
important instruction is given to the teachers, tend Meet- 
and should in so far as possible avail themselves fa 
of the opportunity. If this is done they are more 
likely to be in touch with the work and to be able to direct 
it intelligently in their own schools. Principals rely too much 
upon the reports that teachers bring them of meetings held 
with the various members of the supervisory force. It is 
difficult to be a good reporter, and very few people achieve 
it. Teachers are no exception, and so principals should at- 
tend these meetings themselves and get the same instruction 
that the teachers do, and then they can understand the 
special instruction given by the supervisor when visiting the 
school. 
The principal is necessarily, as has been said, the respon- 
sible head of the school, and should be so recognized by all 
the supervisory officers, and yet the principal should be 
responsible for something definite. The general policy of 
the school system, the course of study and the broader phases 
of method, are of necessity laid down by the supervising 
force, and it is the business of the principal to master these, 
and to endeavor to make his school as good as possible along 
these specific lines. 
While it is the duty of the supervising force in every way to 
strengthen the hands of the principal and increase his conse- 
quence, it is equally important for the principal not to set up 
a little machine of his own, but to work in harmony with the 
entire administrative force in bringing about results such as 
are approved in general.
-P-A-G-E-206
198 The School and Its Life 
If the principal of a school finds that the supervisor is 
giving instruction in his particular subject which does not

secure what appears to him harmony, he should take the 
matter to the superintendent, whose business it is to see that 
harmony prevail throughout the system. 
If the supervisor finds that the principal is not carrying 
out instructions given, provided these instructions are such 
as the superintendent himself approves, but is working 
against the supervisor or against the system, giving instruc- 
tions to teachers contrary to the general policy of the school 
administration, thereby creating discomfort, unrest, and dis- 
sension, it is the duty of the superintendent to come to the 
rescue and by either diplomatic or forceful measures to 
bring about harmony, or by radical measures of discipline 
to do away with the troubles. Of course the children are 
the ultimate sufferers from a lack of harmony in the admin- 
istrative system, and next to the children the teachers are 
the sufferers if the supervisor and principal, and the various 
other “‘bosses,’”’ do not work together and do not recognize 
the teacher as an important factor. 
Now what is the teacher to do to whom the principal gives 
one kind of instruction and the supervisor another? That 
will depend much upon the relations that exist between the 
teacher and the various supervisory officers. The occasion 
calls for tact, but if the relations are as they should be, 
the first duty of such a teacher is to talk plainly with the 
_principal and to point out the discrepancies in instruction,
-P-A-G-E-207
The Supervisor and the Special Teacher 199 
and if the principal insists that he is right and that his instruc- 
tion must be followed regardless of what the supervisor says, 
as sometimes happens, upon the next visit of the supervisor, 
if the work is not done according to his instructions, the 
teacher should frankly tell the supervisor that he is acting 
under instructions from the principal. But this state of 
things should never occur. 
If the principal takes this stand he should not take it 
with the teacher, which is cowardly, but should take it with 
the supervisor or superintendent and have it out. If the 
teacher finds the friction continuing, his only means of 
self-protection is to go to the superintendent himself and 
tell his troubles, and the superintendent should have such 
sympathetic relations with the teachers that this can be done 
in entire confidence, without danger to the teacher of falling 
from grace either with the principal or the supervisor, and 
if the superintendent is a wise, tactful, and strong head of 
the system, he can, either by tact or force, straighten out 
the difficulty. 
These difficulties of which I have spoken arise chiefly 
because the supervisor of instruction in the special subjects 
has not been properly coérdinated with the system. His 
place has not been made plain either to himself or to the 
principals, and the first duty of the superintendent should 
be to make absolutely plain to the supervisors, to the prin- 
cipals, and to the teachers, just what the office of the super- 
visor is, just what his authority is, just what he is expected 
to do, and just what the attitude of the other factors in the 
school system toward the supervisor should be. This should 
be made so plain that nobody can misunderstand. 
Of course in dealing with human nature difficulties will 
arise. Jealousies, personal dislike on the part of teachers, 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
    200 The School and Its Life 
undue assumption of authority and superiority on the part 
of unwise supervisors, and all the other miserable catalogue 
of human frailties which teachers have in common with the 
rest of the children of Adam, make trouble, but if there is a 
perfectly clear and frankly stated relationship, or system 
of relationships, if the work and degree of authority of every 
supervisor and teacher is stated in unmistakable terms, then 
the problem is greatly simplified, and the only difficulties are 
those that have been mentioned and that may be expected 
to continue as long as human nature is still unregenerate.

CHAPTER XXI 
THE ScHOOL PRINCIPAL 
Tue principal of the school is the single time-honored 
official found in a moder school system. The supe’ 
tendent, supervisors, and all the others are re 
products of new conditions, but the principa! 
master, the head of the school as distingui: 
from the system, has a venerable history. For a very long 
time he had no superior officer, nor has he now, excepting 
in communities with fully developed systems of schools. 
And even in these the character of a school is largely de- 
termined by its principal. Even in the poorest systems there 
are always to be found schools standing out as bright ex- 
ceptions to the prevailing average because they are presided 
over by good principals. 
The position and function of the principal are more nearly 
uniform than those of most officials. It is true that these 
have been modified somewhat by the develop- His 
ment of systems, but these modifications have punctions 
been on the whole slight, and the principal still Compara- 
is quite uniformly the responsible head of the tively . * é Uniform. school, with considerable authority granted by 
both written and unwritten law, and with power enough to 
make or mar the school in spite of superintendent, super- 
visors, and school board. 
He is usually quite secure in his office and not easily

removable except for really compelling reasons. Even in 
cities in which all teachers must be annually elected, the 
changes in principalships are usually few and either due to 
voluntary retirement or manifestly sufficient cause. This 
is as it should be and secures to the school a continuity of 
policy even in the midst of changing administrations of the 
system and changing teachers. 
It enables the principal to become well acquainted with 
his constituency, to know his people, their domestic and 
near social conditions, and their especial needs. He

munity. His relations with the children and their parents 
commonly are honorable to himself, useful to them, and 
productive of that happiness which comes from seeing the 
results of one’s highest endeavors. Indeed, the principal 
should seek to be of the utmost consequence possible in 
his community. It is good for him and for the school. 
He should, however, avoid entangling alliances with organ- 
izations political, ecclesiastical, or other, which are partisan 
in character or controversial in activity. His attitude on 
all questions that divide the community should be either 
judicial or oblivious. That is, he should put none of his 
people on the other side of any artificial barrier. 
Important as these larger relations may be, the real duty 
of the principal is, of course, to be the head of his school 
in all its various activities.

sanitary and other physical conditions of the school are as good 
as possible. He must meet parents who come with complaints 
or children. He must see that the teachers are properly as- 
signed, that the children are classified and distributed most 
effectively. His directing eye must be everywhere, that the 
teachers may teach under the best possible conditions. 
There is unfortunately no need to emphasize these duties 
of the principal. The danger is not that they will be neg- 
lected, but that they will so absorb his time and thought as 
to exclude or minimize his higher and more important duties. 
“Ye pay tithes of mint and anise and cummin and forget 
the weightier matters of the law.’ 
The encroachments of petty duties are insidious. The

pedagogues, the “‘office principal.” Every superintendent 
knows him. He is always there, in his chair at his desk. 
Seldom can he be surprised away from his customary spot, 
and if he is, he apologizes. 
As superintendent, visiting schools, I am always glad to 
have to hunt for the principal and find him in some class- 
room studying the work or helping the teacher. 
I can fancy an overworked principal saying: “How am 
I to get time to do all these things if I do not Must not 
stay in the office?” It is a fair question. The Sacrifice 
answer is, first by system. Have certain times for Important

school, or at certain hours during the session. Devise some 
method by which you can be called if a matter of sufficient 
consequence arises. Second, by dispatch. Attend quickly 
to matters of detail and distribute some of the work of pre- 
paring reports among the teachers in such a way that it will 
be burdensome to none. Third, cut the Gordian Knot; let 
some things go, if necessary. Determine what are the im- 
portant things and do them whether or no. If any needs 
must suffer, let them be the less important. But with sys- 
tem, dispatch, and courage, usually all classes of duties can be 
properly done.

the school as a democratic community, and relates all ques- 
tions of conduct to its effect upon the common life, his spirit 
will permeate the school. 
The principal is necessarily in all difficult questions of 
conduct the final arbiter, and to this end he must be just.

drew from her the information that the trouble was with 
the principal. He had no real sympathy with her work. 
She was ambitious and capable. She wanted to do work 
above the average. She even had ideas for development. 
Her heart was in her teaching, in its higher possibilities, but 
the principal’s heart was not there. It was rather in the 
machinery of the school. He would visit her occasionally, 
was never unkind, and she had, after repeated efforts, secured 
a half hour in which she might sit down with him and talk 
over her ambitions and schemes for finer teaching. The 
result was a chill and disheartenment, which, unless the 
fire burned very strongly, would in time impair her 
efficiency. 
This principal was throwing away a golden opportunity. 
He wanted good work in his school and expected his teachers 
to teach well, but he was so concerned with the mechanical 
administration of his domain that he could not get into the 
hearts of his teachers. The teacher had the freedom of iso-

such environment.

CHAPTER XXII 
Homer AND SCHOOL 
THE relations of home and school offer to the teacher 
perennial problems for solution. Most of them fall readily 
into two classes. 
1. How to reconcile the often conflicting claims of the 
two institutions upon the time and attention of the children. 
2. How to inculcate in the children ideals and standards 
of conduct often quite at variance with those prevailing in 
the home, without either arousing indignant protest from the 
parents or the children themselves, or creating a lack of 
respect for the home and the family. 
The problems of the first class are really easier of solution 
than those of the second. They are quite largely matters of 
law which the teachers must enforce whether or no. Still, 
the method of enforcement will have much to do with the 
teacher’s happiness and usefulness. 
Moreover, law itself but represents a social condition, and 
it may be well to discuss briefly the social conditions in- 
dicated by existing laws conferring upon school officials 
authority to compel attendance and dictate Compuliony 
courses of study and modes of control. Attendance

think of the strides that have already been made in this 
direction by our most cherished institutions. 
209
-P-A-G-E-218
  210 The School and Its Life 
I suppose that no step in civilization has been so directly 
opposed to individualism and so complete a concession 
to the principle of state control as the establishment of 
schools for the education of all people and compulsory 
attendance upon them. In most states there are found 
upon the statute books laws which make it possible for 
public officials to go into every house and hale the chil- 
dren to school, putting upon the parents who object the 
task of proving that they are making sufficient provision 
for the education of their children. We regard justly the 
family as the bulwark of moral institutions, and it is a far 
cry from the stage of civilization, which gives the parent 
the power of life and death over his children, to that which 
says he may not even harshly punish a child nor put him to 
work in gainful occupations, but must rear him humanely 
and see that he is given a not inconsiderable intellectual 
training. In comparison with such a stride as this in social- 
ism the mere assumption of control by the state of a public 
utility is an infant’s step. And yet they are few who find 
fault with compulsory schooling, and for the most part 
they are not philosophers, but those whose selfish aims are 
interfered with. This is not intended in any sense as an 
argument for state control of utilities or any other movement 
toward socialism, about which there is much just fear. It 
is simply a statement of conditions as they are. 
The reason of this great movement is not far to seek. 
It is not an imitation of autocratic governments, assum- 
State ing to dictate the life policy of each individual. It

In cases of extreme and manifest need philosophic discus- 
sion is forgotten. It was very early evident that if a free,
-P-A-G-E-219
  Home and School 211 
self-governing state is to exist, its people, the rulers, must be 
intelligent, and more recently we have come to realize that 
not only intelligence on the part of its citizens is essential to 
the perpetuity of democratic institutions, but that such wider 
training as shall make for character and social efficiency is 
equally necessary; and so our schools have gone on enrich- 
ing their courses, increasing their demands upon the chil- 
dren, exacting more and more from the home, with little 
opposition, and the opposition is always only to the more 
recent additions, which, in a short time, themselves become 
recognized as necessities by all. 
It is rather interesting as a social study to see how slight 
is the opposition to a minimum of compulsory school require- 
ment; how gladly our people struggle, often at great sacrifice, 
to comply with the exactions of the law. The school laws 
in most states now require the attendance of children at 
school for a certain number of months of each year for a 
specific number of years, the amount varying greatly. These 
laws are more or less rigidly enforced by supervising officers 
or officers appointed for this especial duty. And notwith- 
standing the occasional pathetic cases, it is usually much 
wiser that these laws, like all laws, be strictly enforced. 
The teacher or school officer who attempts to mollify the 
exactions of the law is in error. That is not his function. 
If laws not good are strictly enforced, they will be repealed. 
If they are good, they admit of no exceptions. 
But with the compulsory attendance laws the ordinary 
teacher usually has little to do. His problems are smaller 
and often more trying. They have to do with the require- 
-ments of the course of study and with the daily attendance. 
Naturally the course of study is prescribed by the board 
of education and must be interpreted and enforced by the
-P-A-G-E-220

teachers, but the complaints regarding it usually come 
directly to the teachers, and that is a wise teacher who

If they do not believe in the curriculum and are inclined to

This condition simply emphasizes what has already been 
said in discussing the duties of school officials, of the wis- 
Teachers 40m of taking the teachers into their confidence,

Taken into educating them to continually higher standards. 
Confidence. Those officials who thrust a new course of study 
upon their body of teachers without careful explanation and 
education leading to conviction are simply dooming their 
course to failure. 
If the parents believe that the work that the children are 
doing in the schools is unwise, they are very sure to use 
stronger adjectives than “unwise” and to send the children 
to school with a prejudice, more or less strong, against the 
teachers and the work, which naturally interferes with suc- 
cess. So the first step in the solution of this particular prob- 
lem is the education of the teachers to such an extent as 
to win their sympathetic = hearty approval of the work 
done in the schools. 
The next step is to meet the complaining parents with 
patience and tact, explaining to them very fully why the 
work is as it is, inviting them to visit the school both

by patient and continuous efforts to bring the parents to 
school and let them see the attractive and educative employ- 
ments in which their children are engaged. In some places 
it has worked well to have special days in each gecure

time. For these special days invitations are sent out, care- 
fully prepared and possibly written by the children; even 
illustrated invitations prepared by the classes are effec- 
tive. 
If an afternoon is selected, the first part of the time should 
be given to the regular work without variation, the parents 
being urged to visit different classes and see gpecial 
what is being done. It is well to follow this up Visiting 
with special, interesting exercises still growing out D4ys- 
of the work and showing the finished product — sometimes 
a drama prepared by the children, sometimes oral recitations 
such as the telling of stories and the explanation of sand- 
table pictures by the pupils, while upon the walls the 
written work of the children is so displayed that it can easily 
be seen. Sometimes such gatherings are objected to because 
they interfere with the work of the school. Possibly they 
do to a degree, but it must be remembered that the best work 
of the school requires the sympathetic support of the home, 
and the little time given to these special days will be much 
more than compensated for by the increased interest and 
the strong support of the parents. 
The parents’ associations have been spoken of in another

chapter. They furnish opportunities for the school author- 
ities to explain the work done in the schools. 
These suggested devices for securing a desired end are 
to be regarded merely as such, and often the bright teacher 
will invent his own, better suited to his particular locality. 
All this takes for granted that we have finally accepted 
Necessity the right of the board of education to determine 
of Fixed | what shall be taught in the schools. There are 
Courses of many parents, some of them among the more in- 
Senay: telligent, who strangely enough think that they 
are quite competent to determine what studies their children 
shall pursue, but it is one of the necessities of a public 
school system, caring for many children, that a certain de- 
gree of uniformity be preserved. This may at times operate 
even against the proper individualization of the work. To 
that degree it is unfortunate, and the teacher should be free 
so to modify the requirements so as to give the individual 
children what they need. But if we assume, as we do, in 
establishing a public school system with compulsory attend- 
ance, that the state is educating the children for citizenship, 
we must of necessity assume that the state knows what 
kind of training citizenship requires. There is no other 
logical conclusion, and while often mistakes are made, un- 
questionably they are fewer in number than if parents of 
all degrees of intelligence and ignorance were to determine 
what their children should study. As a matter of fact, there 
is almost nothing upon which the average citizen is less well 
informed than the principles of education, and while our 
teachers know none too much about them they do know 
more than most citizens, even intelligent citizens. The aver- 
age citizen’s judgment has a purely traditional basis. What 
he had as a boy serves as his criterion, and as in most cases
-P-A-G-E-223
  Home and School 215 
he is reasonably well satisfied with himself, he would give 
his children a training like his own. That is natural, but 
it is of course a purely personal judgment. So from both a 
philosophic and a practical point of view we must again 
admit that the municipality must not only compel children to 
go to school, but must determine within reasonable limits 
what they are to study. 
Possibly a greater difficulty to be met by the teacher is the 
securing regular and prompt attendance at school. Many 
parents who concede the right of the state to Difficulty 
compel attendance of all children at school for of Secur- 
a certain number of months in each year, seek ing At- 
to reserve to themselves the right to determine tendaices 
when their children may be temporarily absent. This 
includes what is technically known as absence, that is, 
remaining away from school for at least an entire session, 
tardiness, or remaining away for the first part of a session, 
and also leaving school before its close. 
The conflict on these grounds is inevitable. The teachers, 
realizing the importance of regular attendance during entire 
sessions if the children are to progress regularly, Conflict

whole caused by irregularity on the part of any of its mem- 
bers, are naturally strenuous in their efforts to secure prompt 
and regular attendance. Added to this motive is pride in a 
good record for the school, stimulated by the knowledge 
that the records of the various teachers are scanned by the 
officials and that comparisons are made. So that sometimes 
promptness and regularity become fetiches and absence and 
tardiness dreadful black beasts. 
On the other hand, the Great American Citizen, while he 
may concede in theory the right of state control, inwardly
-P-A-G-E-224
216 The School and Its Life 
and sometimes outwardly rebels against such control when- 
ever it comes close enough to be felt. He avows his entire 
willingness, even anxiety, that his children shall attend school 
regularly, but insists that if he thinks it best to keep them 
out for a day for family or personal reasons, he is the judge, 
and he will do so. 
Sometimes he is careful to explain the reason to the 
teacher, sometimes he absolutely refuses, more often he

vary all the way from serious personal illness to social func- 
tions and include running of errands for the family, tak- 
ing care of the baby, bad weather, making or receiving 
visits, and countless other reasons too familiar to need 
rehearsing. 
For tardiness the reasons are perhaps even more numer- 
ous and various. 
Very frequently also word comes to the teacher, either 
in a polite note or in a brusque oral demand, that ‘“ John 
be excused at three o’clock.” The reason is sometimes 
stated, sometimes not. When stated, it may be to go on 
an errand, to go driving, or, and more commonly, to take 
some lesson in music, or dancing, or other “accomplish- 
ment.” 
How is the teacher to meet these constantly occurring 
demands? Is the parent’s claim always to be conceded? 
Is the teacher always to insist on a detailed explanation 
and then to exercise his judgment? Either of these solu- 
tions means trouble for the school and often hard feeling, 
if not actual war. Is there no middle ground? 
Usually in urban schools the board of education offers 
some aid to the teacher by establishing certain definite rules,
-P-A-G-E-225
  
Home and School 217 
presumably within its legal rights. These the teacher must 
enforce. The commonest of these requires in every case 
of absence, tardiness, or withdrawal a written pite, 
excuse, properly signed, and stating the cause. Fixed by 
Sometimes the rules go further and state certain Board of 
excuses which alone may be accepted, and require Hducatlon: 
suspension of the pupil after a fixed number of unexcused 
absences. While this is drastic, it certainly lifts the burden 
from the shoulders of the teachers. Frequently, however, 
the teacher or principal is allowed a certain amount of lati- 
tude, the use of which calls for the utmost tact. 
Legally, in most states at least, the power is all with the 
school authorities and the parent is compelled to yield. 
But the wise teacher will recognize the ethical ieee 
claims of the parent and will seek to secure his ence in 
co-operation. The teacher in approaching the Family a 
subject should always bear in mind that the claim Choice of 
of the parent is prior, that all interference with it ine 
for any cause whatever is unfortunate and is excusable only 
on the ground of public necessity, and is in all cases at best 
but the choice of one of two evils. 
Naturally and in the large, the best interests of the state 
cannot be in conflict with the best interests of the family. 
If they were, the family would be a deservedly doomed insti- 
tution and we should revert to Spartan methods. 
Ideally the parent, who is also a citizen, loves his children 
and loves his country. He knows what is best for both and 
voluntarily co-operates with the authorities to bring about 
a state of harmony for the common good which is also the 
individual good. He determines what is best for his chil- 
dren, taking into his view, however, his relations and theirs 
to society. 
   
-P-A-G-E-226
    218 The School and Its Life 
The excuse for interference by the state is based upon the 
notion, true or false, that the parent either cannot or will 
not do his part properly. It is at best but a bungling inter- 
ference that we have, sure to make trouble and, because of 
the rebellious feelings aroused, likely in some degree to 
impair the good it aims to do. ©

appreciate the manifest interest in his children and will wel- 
come conferences in which the teacher and he exchange 
confidences as to conditions and needs. Even the obsti- 
nate parent who stands upon his rights as if defending the
-P-A-G-E-227
  Home and School 219 
constitution, will usually yield to the tactful pressure of 
the teacher for co-operation. 
The solutions offered for these really serious difficulties 
of the teacher may seem inadequate, and they are. Psycho- 
logical problems cannot be solved by mathematics, nor 
can you lay down fixed rules for conduct in dealing with 
others. 
The work of the teacher is spiritual, his difficulties have 
to do with minds, and hence they are to be removed only 
by spiritual means. The right attitude toward the pupil 
and toward his work is the key to the higher success of the 
teacher. His work is to help each child under his control 
to make the most of himself. He must not be blinded to 
that individual insistent duty by any claims of system or 
the charm of uniformity. He should take a sensible rather 
than a technical view of all questions that come before him 
for settlement. For example, punctuality and regularity are 
important; they are so important indeed that they may al- 
most be called technical or practical virtues. Yet, : * . Over- like all such formal claims upon the conscience, Emphasis

go to school late, while others would rush to 
school improperly clothed and without breakfast. Such em- 
phasis indicates lack of perspective and shows that the 
teacher’s view of his work is wrong. He is looking at its 
formal rather than its spiritual phases. If the school is right, 
children like to go and promptly. 
In the problem here discussed the teacher must regard 
himself not as in loco parentis, but as the parent’s helper. He 
is not the boss. Indeed the chief responsibility for the
-P-A-G-E-228

220 The School and Its Life 
child’s welfare is not his, but the parent’s. He is the 
parent’s helper, and must suggest and use all possible means, 
not over the parent, but with the parent, for the child’s 
growth. In particular he must not weaken but must 
strengthen the home in all possible ways. 
Home study of school lessons is one of the minor problems 
Heme to be considered in discussing the relations of the 
Study of | home and the school. In view of the many evils 
School growing out of home study, one is tempted to de- 
Lessons. cry the whole business and declare there should 
be no study at home. Indeed in the lower grades in a 
school organized with the usual two sessions, there should 
be none. There is time enough in the ordinary dual school 
session for all the studying that children under twelve years 
of age should do. If the school is properly organized, that 
is, divided into groups for recitation and study, the lessons 
of a suitable programme can all be prepared in school 
under the eye of the teacher, who directs the study as well 
as the recitation and sees that the children learn how to 
study. 
The ordinary parent, however, is quite willing that his 
children should study at home. He likes to see them bring 
home parcels of books and work over them in the evening. 
He even likes to take a hand himself, especially in arithmetic, 
and show how superior the methods of the past were to 
those of the present. He seldom realizes how essential to 
the proper development of his children is play, and likes to see 
evidences of industry. He does realize that lessons to study 
give children occupation at home and keep them out of mis- 
chief for a time at least. In so far he is right and the school 
can to a large extent direct the home occupation of children 
without taxing their minds by over-time work.

Home and School 221 
It is often remarked by parents that the children attend- 
ing the kindergarten and the lower primary grades of a 
good school take care of themselves at home toa pon, 
surprising extent. The games and exercises of study 
the modern elementary school involve so many should be 
elements of interest and cover such a wide range Seneral- 
that they run over into the home and furnish children with 
amusement and occupation for many hours, to their profit, 
and the relief of the tired mother. The same general prin- 
ciple applies to the higher grades. Without setting children 
to conning lessons at home, the teacher can largely give 
direction to their activities, both healthful and educational. 
He can direct their reading. All children, practically, 
read at home, sometimes to their detriment. The modern 
curriculum offers so wide a range of interests that it is not 
difficult for teachers to give children the best reading by 
suggestion offered in connection with some subject pursued 
in school. The co-operation of the public library is especially 
helpful here and is always easily obtained. 
Nature study offers another field for healthful and profit- 
able home work. So many delightful and interesting activi- 
ties and investigations may be suggested which can best be 
pursued afield. 
Manual training in all its forms offers still another field 
for profitable activity at home. Children like to make 
things to bring to school for the general good. 
Through all these and other activities social training may 
be secured. Looking up topics for the history class or the 
geography class; searching for specimens for the nature 
study lessons; making things with tools to illustrate some 
lesson — all are good training for co-operative life, which is 
democratic citizenship.
-P-A-G-E-230
  222 The School and Its Life 
In the higher grammar grades a certain amount of specific 
study at home may be required, but it should be strictly 
limited and should in so far as possible be of that general 
sort suggested for the primary grades. 
In high schools, especially those having but one session, 
home work is necessary. But here, too, it is commonly 
overdone, often to the physical and intellectual detriment of 
the children. 
It is too often taken for granted that children cannot study 
in school, especially when other recitations are going on. 
Children It is a false assumption. They can and do when 
should the work is of the right sort. Indeed this power 
Studyin of absorption is one of the most valuable of all 
School: the gifts of the school. The programmes of all 
schools should be so arranged as to allow the greatest 
amount of time possible in school to be devoted to study.

absolutely sure, and yet we have a right to our 
judgment, and children must have training. The danger
-P-A-G-E-231
  Home and School 223 
attending instruction in morals in the school is considerable. 
We are very sure to run up against prejudices in regard to 
standards, and to find that some of the things taught in 
school distinctly contravene the doctrine taught in the home. 
This is particularly true of specific instruction with regard 
to moral conventionalities. The dangers are twofold; either 
the children, having faith in the home, indignantly reject the 
counsel of the teacher, or, believing in the superiority of 
the school standard, lose respect for home and parents. 
The so-called temperance instruction required by law in 
most of our states, while it has undoubtedly accomplished 
much good in many places, has, by its very inten- Dangersof 
sity, at times encountered both of these dangers. Condem- 
Some children, having been taught that what the tion. 
teachers say in this matter is extreme, go to the other 
extreme, and are injured not only in mind but in actual 
habit by the instruction. Others, recognizing the wisdom of 
the advice, finding it opposed in the home customs, become 
nuisances in the family and sometimes treat their parents 
with less than becoming respect. 
Almost the only advice that can be given on such subjects 
is that the teacher should exercise great tact and be exceed- 
ingly careful to say nothing that may be deemed to reflect 
upon the parents of the children. It is better to advise the 
children what course to pursue than to criticise courses of 
conduct; that is, the work should be positive rather than 
negative; and it should deal with those subjects upon which 
most right-thinking people are agreed. Manners, of course, 
must be taught, but the teacher should be very careful not 
to apply phrases which may be offensive. 
The experience of the superintendent in one of our larger 
cities who went into a school, and, standing before the 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
    224 The School and Its Life 
children with his hands in his pockets, asked them who he 
was, is perhaps typical. They, not knowing the distinguished 
gentleman, made no answer, but as he urged them to make 
a reply, finally a timid hand was raised and a small lad upon 
receiving due encouragement remarked, ‘‘ You’re no gentle- 
man.” The superintendent somewhat nonplussed looked 
at the teacher and the children. The teacher blushed and 
appeared greatly embarrassed, but the children nodded 
approval of the answer, “Certainly, you’re no gentleman.” 
A little inquiry developed the fact that the teacher had told 
the children that no gentleman stood with his hands in his 
pockets. This is a good illustration of unwise instruction. It 
was quite right to teach the boys to stand erect with theirhands 
in proper position, but the extreme statement was dangerous. 
I have known teachers to say, is gentleman will smoke,” 
or, “No gentleman will drink a glass of wine.” The teacher 
may believe these statements true; but many of the children 
have fathers who do both these things and who desire to be 
regarded by their children as gentlemen. Condemnation 
in general statements is always to be avoided. The teachers 
should teach good manners and good morals, but, as I have 
said, usually by suggestion and example rather than by defi- 
nite dicta. A story of some one performing a good act or 
showing courtesy is worth more to the average child than 
many sermons. But, chiefly, the life of the school should con- 
form to the highest standards that the teacher believes in, 
and this without much talking. If the teacher is always 
courteous, if his conduct in and out of school is above 
reproach, his courtesy and his conduct are soon reflected 
in the school life, which the children absorb. By living a 
high, worthy life, they acquire the habit. Life is the result 
of life,

Some SoctaL FuNCTIONS OF THE SCHOOL 
In the past the public school with its equipment fulfilled 
important social functions, especially in rural and village 
Social communities. It was the neighborhood center 
Functions and the gathering place for various purposes of 
in the Past. the comparatively homogeneous people living in 
the district. The meeting-house and the town hall (if the 
community boasted such a building) served for the larger 
gatherings in which all the people were interested, while 
the schoolhouse supplied the neighborhood need. 
Here gathered young and old for the time-honored spelling 
‘match, which not only set the community searching the 
spelling book and the dictionary in anticipation and in post- 
mortem review, but which furnished the excuse for other 
social functions. 
Here the itinerant writing-master used to assemble the 
youths and maidens of the neighborhood and drill them in 
marvelous pothooks and flourishes, leaving with each one 
at the end of the season some delectable bird or scroll with 
his signature deftly concealed. But the youths and maidens 
who gathered weekly in the schoolhouse to receive his instruc- 
tion reaped much larger social results than they or the teacher 
knew. 
Here the singing teacher, often the schoolmaster himself, 
at regular intervals gathered his flock and drilled it 
226 
‘
-P-A-G-E-235
Some Social Functions of the School 227 
in the singing of the scale and of old-fashioned rounds and 
psalm tunes, and laid foundations for the village choir. It 
was in the schoolhouse that Ichabod Crane instructed the 
youth of Tarrytown in nasal melody. 
Here, too, the debating club of the neighborhood would 
meet, while the intellectually stalwart swains proved to the 
satisfaction of their fair admirers and the discomfiture of 
their opponents, that the pen was mightier than the 
sword. 
The people of the neighborhood considered the school- 
house as the center of their intellectual life and there they 
gathered for varied purposes, but with the one uniform 
result, that the social harmony of the community was in- 
creased and its intellectual life was stimulated. 
Of late there has been a revival of interest in the social 
uses of the school. This revival is in no sense a forced 
product; it has grown out of manifest needs, both procent 
in the country and in the city. No people in the Need of 
world stand more in need of democratic social Social 
centers than do we. There is little, except our Centers: 
political life, that we have now in common with our neighbors. 
This is naturally most notable in cities, but it is true even in 
the country. Practically nowhere have we any more a 
community of people who are alike in birth, tastes, religion, 
moral ideals, or intellectual outlook, excepting in certain 
regions where foreigners of the same nation and religion 
have settled and maintain their foreign speech and customs, 
to the peril of American institutions. 
But people who live together inevitably feel the due 
for some common ground of life. There are so many inter- 
ests in common, even among those who are strangers and 
widely diverse in character and aim, that it is necessary for  
-P-A-G-E-236
  228 The School and Its Life 
them at least to understand one another if even the material 
interests of life are to be well served. 
Within recent years it has come to the minds of many 
that the public school, with its expensive equipment, idle 
School more than half the time, could be made to fur- 
Plant Idle nish the social center for which there is such 
Much of crying need, and a very wide movement has gone 
rae on, apparently almost of itself, in various parts of 
the country, looking to the utilization of the public school 
plant for very many community purposes. In some places, 
especially in small communities, there has been a return to 
something like the conditions of fifty years ago, — people 
making use of the schoolhouse to meet various social and 
intellectual needs. But a condition can never repeat itself, 
and the meetings of the present and of the future in public 
schools will necessarily be quite different from those spon- 
taneous gatherings of the past. 
There is not room in this book, nor is it the purpose of 
the writer, to discuss in extensive detail the various schemes 
for making social use of the school. That is a large sub- 
ject in itself, and is likely to receive adequate discussion 
from specialists. But it seems desirable to point out 
a few of the possible uses of school property, and some that 
are especially educational in character. 
TWO MOTIVES FOR GATHERINGS 
It must be borne in mind that there are always two main 
. motives for gathering people together in the schoolhouse. 
One is the immediate supplying of some local need. This 
may be called the “efficient cause.” The other, and the 
more important, is the getting of people together for 
the influence of the gathering itself upon their minds, — the
-P-A-G-E-237
  Some Social Functions of the School = 229 
harmony and community of thought and feeling which may 
grow out of it. People who gather regularly for any cause 
get the habit of common thinking and of common effort. 
It is this democratic aim of the meeting in the schoolhouse 
which is its “final cause.” 
There are, in general, two classes of organizations that 
are beginning to use the schoolhouse for their meeting-place. 
One is under the immediate direction and control >, 
of the public authorities; the other, voluntary Classes of 
and for needs appealing to the people of a Organiza- 
neighborhood. The former we find especially Hons: 
in very large cities, — roof playgrounds, open gymnasiums, 
public libraries, popular lectures — all educational and on 
somewhat the same basis as the public school itself, main- 
tained and directed wholly by public officials. These serve 
the purpose of taking youths and adults from unwholesome 
to wholesome surroundings, and giving them reasonable 
and valuable employment for their evening hours. They 
do not serve in the highest degree the harmonizing and 
democratizing ends so essential to our people. They are 
an extension of the function of the public school along 
similar lines, and under the same control. 
Vastly more important than this movement, important 
as it is, is the voluntary assembling of people living in the 
vicinity of a schoolhouse for purposes directly yatue of 
or indirectly connected with education, especially Voluntary 
the perfecting of permanent organizations of these Organiza- 
people with the schoolhouse as the gathering place 4°"S 
and the social center. 
The purposes for which such organizations can be formed 
are various. Any aim which is in itself worthy and dignified, 
even if not strictly educational, provided it is not in any sense
-P-A-G-E-238
  230 The School and Its Life 
controversial — that is, any aim which tends to stimulate 
the higher intellectual and social life of the community 
without arousing antagonisms—is a proper basis for an 
organization connected with the school. 
The most natural subject, at least for the beginnings of 
this movement, is education itself. The rapidly spreading

modern educational principles. Parents realize that the 
schools are very different from the schools of their youth, 
and while some are dissatisfied, others honestly seek to 
understand what the changes mean, and nearly all are willing 
to listen to explanations of the new things that their children 
tell them about, some of which they are prone to condemn. 
THE PARENTS’ ASSOCIATION 
Naturally the first organization to have its place of 
meeting in the school is what has come to be known as a 
First the  “‘Parents’ Association,” organized at first defi- 
Mothers’ _nitely and specifically for the study of educational 
ct principles. Sometimes this association takes in 
its earlier days a very modest form, that of a mothers’ 
club. Such clubs have been organized by kindergartners 
in many parts of the country for the study of some of the 
simpler problems of the training of little children. The 
mothers gather at these meetings with the kindergartner 
as the leader, usually to talk over their children and the 
work of the home as related to that of the kindergarten. 
As’ a result, they get some light on educational questions; 
they become acquainted with the kindergartner and come to
-P-A-G-E-239
  Some Social Functions of the School 231 
understand her spirit, and they begin to be acquainted with 
one another. The Swede, the Pole, the Russian, the Teu- 
ton, the English and the Yankee, are brought together under 
the common sentiment of motherhood, and in these meetings 
rub off a little of the natural antagonism and take to their 
homes a little sweeter spirit as a result. They also begin 
to regard the school as not simply the place to which their 
children are sent for a few hours each day, but as a directing 
force in the education of these same children even in the 
home. 
The parents’ association, proper, is an organization of 
fathers and mothers, and citizens generally who are interested 
in education. Its meetings are held in the schoolhouse and 
vary in character according to the community. Usually 
some address, or addresses, are made by educational experts, 
either connected with the local system or not, on topics 
directly related to the education of children and adapted 
to the immediate local needs. These meetings are held 
at regular intervals under some definite organization and 
programme scheme. Occasionally features of entertainment 
are added and after the formal meeting the time is devoted 
to social intercourse. 
If the association is well managed, and the interest main- 
tained, the organization is likely to take on a more definite 
character and to enlarge its scope. Frequently pefnite 
there are several committees whose business it Plans of 
is to look after its various interests, and to co- St4y- 
operate with the school people in furthering the interests 
of the local school. In some cases definite plans of study 
are outlined and taken up by such members as are sufficiently 
interested to pursue them. Not infrequently adjunct asso- 
ciations are formed, such as boys’ clubs and girls’ clubs for
-P-A-G-E-240
    232 The School and Its Life 
legitimate and proper purposes. Frequently associations 
of the former pupils of the school are organized, either in 
connection with the parents’ association, or independently. 
All of these bodies center about the local school, from 
which they derive their motive and impulse. When well 
Strengthen conducted and persistently maintained they are 
the School. of inestimable value to the school authorities and 
to the community. Any school officer who has not enjoyed 
the advantages of such organizations cannot realize the gain 
to him in local support from this getting together of the 
school’s patrons for an intelligent discussion of the work of 
the school. The result is almost invariably enthusiastic 
devotion, sometimes even more enthusiastic than intelligent, 
but the gain is real. It manifests itself in political support, 
but, more important still, in educational support. The 
undertakings of the school, being understood and having 
been discussed and approved by the association, are sup- 
ported in the home, and that direful lack of harmony, that 
most disastrous criticism of teachers and teachers’ methods 
which are so common and which tend to destroy the respect 
of the children for the school and to impair the work of the 
school, disappear under the softening influence of a common 
understanding. 
Moreover, the community gains immensely in democratic 
spirit. The fact of the coming together of many citizens 
Cultivates with a common motive and a common interest, 
Democracy. and that interest the highest of all that concerns 
them, tends to create a common consideration and sym- 
pathy and understanding which are essential in a demo- 
cratic state. The support and the far-reaching effects to 
the school, both educational and social, of these gatherings 
cannot be computed.
-P-A-G-E-241
  
Some Social Functions of the School 233 
Now a few practical suggestions as to the organization 
and support of these associations. Almost of necessity 
the original mover must be some one connected Principal 
with the local school, preferably the principal. Usually 
He and his teachers should by private conference *#¢ Mover. 
secure first the influence and interest of a few of the more 
intelligent and influential citizens of the district. They 
should, through written and oral invitations, get as many 
parents as possible to visit the school and become inter- 
ested in school work even before the meetings are held. 
Days of appointed visitation, for which formal cards of 
invitation written by the children and signed by the teachers 
are sent out, often facilitate the movement at its beginning. 
Then as soon as a considerable degree of interest is aroused, 
a meeting may be called by the principal and the teachers 
and by several citizens of the district. 
The first meeting is an important one. It should be 
made interesting. Whatever is done should be adapted 
to the local intelligence and character. It is pirst Meet- 
often well to provide material refreshment and ing Impor- 
some features of entertainment upon the pro- #2 
gramme, but there should be an educational trend which 
will catch the attention of the people and lead them to want 
more of the same sort. 
Usually in perfecting the organization it is better for the 
school people themselves to keep in the background and let 
those assembled elect their own officers from officers 
among the parents. The principal and some should be 
teachers should be upon important committees Laymen- 
in order to see that the organization does not run away with 
itself, but they should work rather from behind than con- 
spicuously.  
-P-A-G-E-242
234 The School and Its Life 
After the organization of the association, its permanent 
success will depend upon the character of the programmes 
offered at the meetings. Interest must be maintained and 
too much repetition avoided. But it must always be borne 
in mind that the purpose of the association is educational 
and that all adjunct bodies and all plans of work and 
entertainment should tend to keep up interest in the school 
and in education and to strengthen the hands of the 
teachers. 
Those conducting the associations need to be careful not 
to be so ambitious as to shoot over the heads of the citizens; 
also to be careful to interest in active work as many citizens 
of the community as possible. The committees should in- 
clude representatives of all classes and an effort should be 
made to set large numbers of the people at work. 
The political power of such organizations is immense. If 
we could have in every school district a body of citizens 
Political | reasonably intelligent upon educational questions, 
Power and profoundly devoted to the school, it would 
Eas be much less easy for the politician and the politi- 
cal school board to use the schools for political ends. 
There is no occasion for fear that the organizations will 
be overactive. Such may be the case now and then, but it 
will be but temporary, and overactivity is much to be pre- 
ferred to inactivity. It must be remembered that progress 
in education will not go very far in advance of its apprecia- 
tion by the average citizen. The progress which is made 
without the approval of the community is likely to be short- 
lived and to end in reaction, so that for every reason, social 
and educational, associations of parents and allied organiza- 
tions, making the public school the center of the higher 
community life, should be encouraged.
-P-A-G-E-243
     
Some Social Functions of the School 235 
There are sometimes objections to the meeting of these 
organizations in the schoolhouse, on the ground that the fur- 
niture and equipment of the school building are ,qaptation 
peculiarly adapted to school purposes and to no of Fur- 
others. It is true that the furniture of the Titure. 
modern schoolroom is not well adapted to free gatherings. 
(It may be not out of place to say here that it is not well 
adapted to school purposes either, and at some time rational 
furniture will replace that which is now in use.) But there 
are certain very simple remedies which may be employed 
with little effort. In the rooms which it is desirable to 
throw open for evening assemblies, the desks can be placed 
in rows upon strips of wood so that they may be easily 
shifted or lifted to one side, making room for movable fur- 
niture. Ultimately it is to be hoped that all schools will be 
equipped with gymnasiums, assembly halls, and other places 
suitable for such gatherings.

  CHAPTER XXIV 
ScHoot Laws 
Tue laws under which school boards and school systems 
are organized, while not directly within the province of the 
average teacher, are still of great consequence to him, inas- 
much as they affect materially his tenure of office, his free- 
dom, and his chances of success. Certainly all teachers 
should be intelligent as to the laws relating especially to 
their profession. Hence it has seemed best to devote a 
chapter of this book to a brief discussion of the various sys- 
tems of legal control of schools prevailing in this country. 
We have no national system of education. The Bureau 
of Education, connected with the Department of the Interior 
No in Washington, has at its head a Commissioner. 
National His functions, however, are wholly academic. 
System of He owns no offices; he has no patronage to dis- 
Education. ++ibute; he has no control whatever over any school 
system or any school-teacher in the United States, with the 
exception of the Indians and other wards of the nation. As 
the work of the Bureau has thus far evolved, it is confined 
to the gathering of facts and statistics and the publication 
of documents of information, separately at times, but chiefly 
in the form of an annual volume. Practically the sole 
influence of the Department of Education upon the country 
is that exerted by the personality of the Commissioner. It 
is impossible in this book to discuss the wisdom or unwisdom 
236
-P-A-G-E-245
School Laws 237 
of our present lack of national control of schools, and whether 
it would be desirable to exalt the Bureau into a Department 
and place funds at its disposal. 
Our systems are state and local. All the states in the 
Union assume the prerogative of controlling to a greater 
or less degree public education within their bor- ‘Tendency 
ders. This function has been chiefly exercised toward 
by the legislatures of the states in passing laws State 
to give authority to local bodies to control schools Ctl. 
and school systems, though there has been of late years an. 
increasing tendency toward the assumption of other powers 
by the state, and more and more it is becoming customary 
for states to contribute money from their treasuries to pub- 
lic education. This money, of necessity, is distributed by 
a central authority, which gives the state itself some con- 
trol over local school affairs, but almost universally the funds 
are distributed among the local bodies to be disbursed by 
local authorities, the state’s control being limited to the 
establishment of conditions which must be met before funds 
can be received. This statement does not include special 
state institutions, as normal schools and universities, which 
are not within the scope of the purpose of this book. 
These conditions vary in different states, but commonly 
have reference to the length of the school year and the 
qualifications of the teachers, and sometimes to wige 
conditions hygienic and other of the school build- Variations 
ings and grounds. In some states the central among 
authority goes so far as to control the licensing States 
of teachers through fixing a minimum standard, but gen- 
erally the state control is very loose and perfunctory. Very 
few states have any adequate provision for the supervision 
of the schools, this being regarded as a local matter, though 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  238 The School and Its Life 
there is a tendency to increase such supervision under state 
control in the more progressive states. Minnesota, for 
instance, has state inspectors for schools of different grades, 
as one for high schools, one for graded elementary schools, 
and one for ungraded schools, and the control of certain 
funds voted by the legislature, to be distributed on the basis 
of a fixed standard of efficiency, makes this supervision 
effective. 
STATE CONTROL 
In most of the states the head of the Department of Edu- 
cation is a State Superintendent, whose powers, as I have 
indicated, vary from the vaguest to those of considerable 
consequence. In some states the superintendent is the only 
official bearing relations to all the state educational insti- 
tutions, though boards exist for the government of special 
institutions, such as normal schools, state universities, schools 
for the care of the defectives and the like. In some states 
a single State Board of Education has control of all of 
these, the State Superintendent meeting with the Board. 
In Massachusetts and some other states there is no State 
Superintendent, the secretary of the State Board perform- 
ing many of the duties which the State Superintendent 
usually performs, but the State Board itself here exercises 
considerable authority. 
The control of local schools is in most states assumed 
either by counties or by municipalities. County control 
is commonly exercised only over rural and village schools, 
the municipalities within the counties having independent 
systems, though in some states, as Georgia, for example, 
the county superintendent is also the superintendent of all 
city schools in the county. 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  School Laws 239 
RURAL SCHOOLS 
In the rural districts, in most states, each school district 
has its local school committee, which appoints the teacher 
and in a general way controls the school affairs of the 
district, subject to a limited control by the county super- 
intendent, though in some states a town or township com- 
mittee has taken the place of the local district committee 
and appoints the teachers for all the districts of the town- 
ship. 
TOWN CENTRALIZATION AND TRANSPORTATION 
A recent movement, which has gained much headway in 
a few states, tends to do away wholly with the local district 
school and to gather the pupils of rural townships into 
central schools, the community furnishing transportation. 
This system has very much in its favor. It makes it pos- 
sible for the community to have a more complete and 
properly ventilated, lighted, and heated schoolhouse; care- 
fully selected, trained teachers, working under proper super- 
vision and properly classified; and pupils properly grouped 
and graded. In short, it provides the rural school children 
with many of the advantages of village and city schools. 
The cost of the transportation of pupils is more than com- 
pensated for by the reduction of the expense incident to the 
maintenance of so many small rural schools. A plan so 
rational, so economical, and so helpful is sure to gain popular 
approval, and undoubtedly in a few years the isolated 
schools will have disappeared from the most enlightened 
states, and the centralized schools will have replaced them. 
In most states the teachers of rural schools, though often 
appointed by the local committees, must he licensed by the
-P-A-G-E-248

county superintendent. The county superintendent is in 
some cases elected by the people, as in Minnesota, and in 
some cases appointed by the State Board of Education, as 
in New Jersey. 
MUNICIPALITIES 
As has been mentioned, in most states the municipality, 
whether village or city, is an independent school district,

in regard to practically all other elements of control. These 
differences are due largely to local history. Our various 
school systems have not been made upon a single pattern, 
but have grown up out of purely local conditions. Many 
of them may be said to have happened. They have been 
simply the most convenient devices resorted to by people 
who wished their children to have schooling, but who knew 
nothing of the best ways. Yet it is often true that because 
of the long continuance of a system, and the fact that people

Often quently much wiser to improve and make the

radical or violent changes which the people do not under- 
stand and which necessarily arouse antagonism and oppo- 
sition. In a previous chapter the educational powers of 
the board have been referred to, and perhaps treated with 
sufficient fullness for the purposes of this book. So I will 
confine myself here to the methods in vogue for securing 
boards of education and to their extra-educational functions.
-P-A-G-E-249
  
School Laws 241 
Boards of education vary in size from three members to 
more than one hundred, and commonly the size bears slight 
relation to the size of the community. Forcon- Boards 
venience in discussion, boards may be divided into Vary 
two classes, large and small, calling boards of Sie 
nine members or fewer small, and boards composed of more 
than nine large except in the three very large cities. 
One of the mooted questions of the day is as to the rela- 
tive excellence of large boards as compared with small, 
the tendency in thought and practice being towards smaller 
boards, although some very able leaders of educational 
thought, notably United States Commissioner William T. 
Harris, believe in large boards. 
Another question is whether these boards should be 
elected at large, all the members representing the entire 
municipality, or by wards, voting precincts, or other tech- 
nical divisions of the municipality. Here again the ten- 
dency of modern thought is toward the election of mem- 
bers at large for the entire community. 
In some cities there is a dual representation, — some 
members of the board being elected at large and some 
representing divisions of the city. 
There is also diversity as to the methods by which mem- 
bers of school boards obtain office, the two prevailing 
methods being appointment by some central pians for 
authority, and election by the people. Inthe case Securing 
of appointed members, the appointing power is Member- 
usually the mayor of the city, though not always. tal 
In a few cases the appointment is made by the Common 
Council; in at least one, as Philadelphia, by the judges of 
the District Courts; in also at least one, as Milwaukee, 
by a special commission, whose members are themselves  
-P-A-G-E-250
242 The School and Its Life 
  appointed for this sole purpose; and in at least one other by 
the Governor of the state. In a few cases a committee of 
the Common Council acts as board of education; this is true 
in Buffalo. 
Moreover, members of boards are elected or appointed 
for terms varying from one year in some places to seven 
Term of in others, so that in some places the whole board, 
Office. in others half the board, and in still others a 
varying minority, retires at one time. 
Again, the extra-educational powers of the board vary 
greatly. In a number of cities the board is a taxing body,

the board has no power but to take the money given it by 
some other authority and to spend it under very strict limi- 
tations; and in some cities, as in Boston, it is not even 
allowed to build school buildings. The purse strings are 
held in some cases by the Common Council, and in others 
by a municipal board of finance. 
It is evident from the above that we have no uniform 
system for the control of public education. All who are 
No Legal reasonably well acquainted with school con- 
Panacea. ditions, however, know that there are both good 
schools and bad schools under practically all conceivable 
conditions. There is no legal panacea for educational ills. 
Under whatever system schools are conducted, unless the 
people are vigilant, the schools will suffer. No method of 
appointment, left unguarded, will of necessity secure a good 
school board. An inference to be drawn from these remarks 
is that, in general, the nearer the board is to the people the 
easier is it for the people’s wishes to be reflected. 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
  
School Laws 243 
Manifestly, it is impossible to discuss all the various sys- 
tems outlined above, but we may discuss briefly a few gen- 
eral principles which affect most of them. 
LARGE OR SMALL BOARDS 
Is it better to have large boards or small? The main 
argument for the large board is that the people are better 
represented; that all classes and all localities ne 
can have representation in a large board, and as_ ments for 
a consequence all interests are more likely to be Larger 
looked after; and that popular interest in educa- Boatie: 
tion is likely to be kept at a higher plane if the people have 
many representatives, as there will be necessarily many 
centers of influence. Another argument is that it is much 
more difficult in a large board for cliques or small 
parties to secure control; that there can be nothing like a 
close corporation or a star-chamber proceeding with a large 
legislative body, while small boards can meet quietly and 
even secretly, and if corrupt can much more easily escape 
detection. 
More and more, however, popular sentiment has been 
tending away from the large school board, and this change 
of sentiment has grown out of conditions. 
It has been found that small boards are more efficient 
than large boards; that work is done by them more speedily 
and more carefully; that it is easier to fix respon- Inefficiency 
sibility for misdeeds. Large boards are always of Sub- 
organized on the committee plan; the larger the Committee 
board the greater the number of committees pla 
and the more minute the division of function. Com- 
mittees are created, not. because the work of the school 
board naturally divides itself into so many parts, but in

  244, The School and Its Life 
order that school board members, as many as possible, may 
have chairmanships. As every one familiar with legislation 
knows, in the greater number of cases the action of com- 
mittees is practically decisive — that is, legislative bodies 
generally pass their reports without much deliberation or 
consideration. The committee represents the majority and 
the majority stands by the committee, so that often very 
important matters are decided, not by the board of edu- 
cation, but by some small section of the board whose 
members happen to be assigned for political reasons to a 
particular committee, for whose work they are frequently 
wholly unqualified. 
Moreover, in large boards it is practically impossible to 
Responsi- fix responsibility. If there is corruption the 
bility Hard condition is represented by Nast’s famous cartoon 
toFix, of the Tweed Ring, each one pointing with his 
thumb to his neighbor and remarking, “It’s him.” 
The tendency of the present time is to limit the powers 
of boards of education to legislation, and to employ for all 
Limita- executive functions expert officials, as a super- 
tion of intendent of schools, a superintendent of build- 
Powers. ings and others. This arrangement makes it 
possible to hold officials responsible, and also diminishes the 
burden of duties of the members of the board, and makes 
it less necessary to have many committees. It is in 
accordance with the modern tendency in municipal govern- 
ment to centralize authority. 
In most cases large boards are elected by the people and 
represent sections of the municipality. Comparatively few 
large boards are appointive. In Philadelphia there is a 
large board, appointed, as has been said, by the judges, and 
there have been, until very recently, also sectional boards with
-P-A-G-E-253
  School Laws 245 
practical control over the schools of the sections, the duties 
of the central board and its officers being greatly circum- 
scribed. This system is about the worst conceivable, and 
has recently been modified by lessening the authority of 
the local boards. 
REPRESENTATION 
Shall boards be elected or appointed at large, representing 
the entire community, or shall the members represent dis- 
tricts? The argument for the latter, which is ete 
the old and disappearing plan, is that the sec- Board 
tional board represents the people better; that Represents

school board, the districts not represented by residents 
are likely to suffer; and that the small board, whose mem- 
bers may perhaps all live within one part of the city, is 
likely to overlook the needs of the remaining parts, and to 
favor especially its own districts. 
Here again the theory does not seem to agree with the 
common experience. There is no doubt a certain local 
pride and local jealousy in boards whose members Futility 
represent districts, but instead of this working to of This 
the interests of the individual districts, it too fre- Argu- 
quently results in bickering, disagreements, delays, ™¢™* 
and in bargains, corruption, and all iniquity. I have known 
the discussion as to the location of a school building, whether 
in one ward or another, to prevent the erection of any school 
for years, the children going without proper school facili- 
ties meanwhile. Each member, feeling that he represents 
a district and not the municipality, is likely to see only the 
needs of his own district and to ignore other parts of the 
city equally deserving and needy, or more so.
-P-A-G-E-254
  2.46 The School and Its Life 
The smaller board, of necessity, takes in the needs of the 
entire community. Citizens of any particular district may 
Small be relied upon to see that the needs of their dis- 
Board trict are presented to the school board. The 
Must be school board then assumes a judicial attitude

need and where money can be spent to the greatest advan- 
tage to the city as a whole. The results are almost always 
better than under a sectional system. To secure the repre- 
sentation of local interests the school laws of New York 
City provide for local boards without authority, whose 
duties are to inspect the schools of their districts and advise 
the school board regarding them. Theoretically this is a 
good plan. 
It is much easier to secure good school board members 
if they represent the whole city than if they represent dis- 
tricts. Under the latter system local petty poli- Easier to xy "4

the wishes of the better citizens and of the community as a 
whole. I recall in one city a school board member who was 
both ignorant and immoral and who commonly came to 
the school board meetings intoxicated, but who held office 
for years, greatly to the distress of good citizens, until finally 
the board of education itself was legislated out. He repre- 
sented a small precinct composed of people so like himself 
that no one could beat him at its polls. He could not have 
been elected on even the worst general municipal ticket, and 
no mayor would have dared to appoint him. 
In case of an elective board, the members nominated 
by the different parties must stand the scrutiny of the entire
-P-A-G-E-255
School Laws 247 
community, and this fact of itself makes it necessary for 
the parties to put up men of better character and higher 
standing than would be necessary if they were voted for 
merely by their neighbors. This is not merely theoretical; 
experience generally has shown its truth. 
ELECTIVE OR APPOINTIVE BOARDS 
Is it better for boards to be elected by the people or ap- 
pointed by some central authority? Here there is wider 
difference of opinion than upon any of the questions already 
asked, and the answers are not so readily forthcoming. A 
few years ago there was a very decided turn of public senti- 
ment in favor of appointive boards. Recently there has 
been a reaction and the tendency seems to be again toward 
elective boards. The reason for these changes of sentiment 
naturally is that under no system are the people sure of secur- 
ing good boards. Bad boards and bad schools may result 
under all methods. It is with schools as with other munic- 
ipal matters in the United States, that good and bad alter- 
nate and vary with the degree of interest among the people. 
A bad condition of things arises, school boards are corrupt, 
schools deteriorate, and people become aroused and insist 
upon a change in method,—it may be from elective to 
appointive, or the reverse, — and there is an improvement 
under the influence of the reform movement. A good 
board is secured, and perhaps a good superintendent and 
a good system, and then this particular and typical section 
of the great American people, having accomplished its duty, 
sits down in smug satisfaction. But the very watchful 
“politician,” seeing the people easily satisfied, gradually 
begins to assume control again. Whether a board is elected 
or appointed, pretty soon the self-seeking politician takes  
-P-A-G-E-256
  248 The School and Its Life 
the place of the good citizen, who was put in under the 
influence of the reform movement, and the old evils return. 
As has been shown in the history of many cities in this 
country, permanent reform in any branch of municipal 
government seems to be yet beyond our reach. 
Now as to the question asked, this may be said: If the 
appointing power, say the mayor, is conscientious and intelli- 
gent and reasonably free from political control, he will 
appoint a good school board; if he is not he will appoint a 
bad school board. Persistent and strong popular senti- 
ment are important factors. 
If a city has had for a long time a fine school board, a 
mayor would hesitate to impair its quality by appointing 
an inferior man. Moreover, in the face of great public 
interest in education, the mayor also would hesitate to put 
an unsuitable man on the school board. But in general, 
the mayors of the country are not men of very high grade. 
They are local politicians of somewhat more than average 
intelligence and not more than average principle, who pro- 
pose to work the city government for every possible advan- 
tage — business, financial, and political — to themselves. 
This is the average mayor, and an institution so rich in 
patronage and spending so much moneyas the public schools, 
Patronage cannot hope to escape. I recall one mayor who 
Tempting. appointed a school board for the declared purpose 
of removing the superintendent, because the superintendent 
had detected the mayor, who was a paper dealer, in frauds 
in selling paper to the school children. In this particular 
case the mayor failed, the board refusing to obey his orders. 
Thus the average board appointed by the mayor is not of 
very high grade, does not contain the best men, and, in my 
personal judgment, is a little below the grade of smaller  
-P-A-G-E-257
  School Laws 249 
boards elected by the people. I know one city in which 
the school board, appointed by the mayor, has been for 
many years a tool of a corporation doing busi- gay 
ness with the city. The local political boss is the Boards 
paid employee of this corporation, and he nomi- Elected 
nates the mayor, whom the people elect, it is true. PY People. 
The mayor always keeps a majority of the school board 
friendly to this corporation. The people have at times, 
in desperation, tried to do something, but without success. 
The mayor is a pretty good mayor in general, and when 
election time comes there are so many questions involved 
besides the appointment by him of a school board that this 
is overlooked, and so he is elected again and again. 
In my judgment, it is better to bring the election of a 
school board home to the people. A small board elected 
at large is, in the long run, likely to average better than any 
kind of board appointed in any other way. If it is not a 
good board it is the people’s fault; its election is a direct 
issue and is not confused with other issues. It is often said 
that if the mayor does not appoint a good board it will count 
against him, and so it may; but, as I have said, so many other 
issues are involved that this is often lost sight of. But if 
there are one or two or three school-board members to be 
elected by the whole people they necessarily think of them. 
There is much more likelihood that the electors will see to 
it that they get good men than that the mayor will, who has 
so many other interests to consider. In more than one in- 
stance I have known the election of school-board members 
to be the principal feature of a municipal election. I recall 
one case in which good school-board nominees by one 
party were able to carry through an otherwise inferior ticket 
because the school-board nominations of the other party 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  250 The School and Its Life 
were bad. The schools are the dearest interest the people 
have, and with proper effort it is easier to arouse them on 
this issue than on any other. 
LONG OR SHORT TERMS _ 
Should school-board members hold their office for long or 
short terms? Neither very long nor very short. Three or 
four years is a good length of term. They should remain 
in office long enough to be able to do good work after they 
have become acquainted with their duties and to demon- 
strate to the people what they can accomplish. 
It is not wise, usually, to have a majority of the board, 
or even half a board, retire from office at the same time. 
Majority It is better to have a majority always holding 
should not Over. In some cities a board of five, elected for 
Retire five years, one going out each year, has proven 
pte i satisfactory. This system has one weakness — 
that it is too difficult to change the board. If 
matters are going badly the people cannot get at them soon 
enough. In other cities a board of nine, three going out 
each year, works well. This secures a strong majority 
familiar with the workings of the board, and it takes only 
two elections to upset a board if it is doing badly. 
In general, it is safe to say that the terms of members of 
the school board should not be less than three years, or 
more than five years, and that only a minority, never a 
majority, should retire at one time. This secures intelli- 
gence in work and assures a continuous policy. 
q 
CONTROL OF FINANCES wt 
Should school boards control the school finances? In a 
number of cities in which they do, it seems to work well.
-P-A-G-E-259
  
School Laws 251 
This should never be the case unless boards are elected by 
the people, however. A board of education, elected, may 
as safely be trusted with taxation and with the expenditure 
of funds as a Common Council or any other board elected. 
If the city has a central board of finance it may be better 
to allow this board to make appropriations after proper 
representation by the school board. 
One thing to be avoided in all cases is the control of school 
funds in any way by what is known as the Common Council, 
—the one municipal body that is sure to be always bad. 
Money for schools should be appropriated by some authority 
wholly in sympathy with schools and bent on their improve- 
ment. Naturally, from this point of view, the school board 
is best qualified. 
The chief danger in conferring such power upon it is 
that the general taxpaying ability of the municipality may 
not be sufficiently considered, nor its other needs. Much 
is to be said in favor of a central board of taxation, acting 
within legally prescribed limitations. It is well to have 
a legal minimum, as a fixed percentage based upon the tax- 
able property, or a gross amount per pupil enrolled, so 
that enough to maintain the schools at a fair degree of 
efficiency is made mandatory. 
TENURE OF OFFICE 
There is wide variation in regard to the length of the 
term for which both superintendents and teachers are ap- 
pointed. In very many places the term for both is one 
scholastic year. 
The term of the superintendent is, in different places, 
two, three, four, five, six, seven, and ten years, while in a 
few, the term is indefinite, “during good behavior.” The
-P-A-G-E-260
  252 The School and Its Life 
term of employment for teachers is rarely more than one 
year except in those cities where it is indefinite or “during 
good behavior.” 
What plan is best? 
First, as to the superintendent, unquestionably a term of 
one year is bad. A new superintendent has barely time to 
One-Year become acquainted with his schools and his board, 
Term when he must again look after his election. Prac- 
Ba tically he must always keep one eye on the coming 
election. It is never far enough ahead to be lost sight of. 
This situation, even with the most independent superin- 
tendent, is crippling. He is never sure that he will be able to 
carry out any policy that he may adopt, and this uncertainty 
lessens his initiative. He is apt to think it better to keep 
things running smoothly as they are than to run the risk of 
stirring people up with the possible result of losing his place 
and seeing his policies reversed before they have been tested. 
It is impossible in a single year to demonstrate the value 
or even the feasibility of any far-reaching plans, 
na especially if they are radical. 
Admit the The term of a superintendent should always be 
Demon- long enough to enable him to inaugurate large 
oa plans for the development of the schools and 
demonstrate their worth. In no term of less

TENURE OF TEACHERS 
The arguments as to the tenure of office of teachers are 
practically the same as for superintendents. The 4. 1a ae 
annual election gives the authorities a very effec- pointment 
tive means of discipline, which, in some cities, Simplifies

On the other hand, the teachers who are looking forward

unduly nervous by it and are really not able to Teachers

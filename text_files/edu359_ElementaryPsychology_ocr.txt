PREFACE 
This book has been written to meet numerous requests for 
an elementary textbook of psychology for the general student 
similar in type to my Psychology for Students of Education. 
Although this new book resembles the earlier work in point 
of view and organization, it differs greatly in content and appli- 
cation. Many topics found in the first book have been omitted 
entirely and many new ones added. The present work con- 
tains a much more extensive account of the introspective, 
studies of conscious states and processes, both simple and 
complex. The discussion of the instinct theory and its appli- 
cations has been rewritten entirely to fit more adequately the 
needs of a general critical course. The chapters on learning 
in complex functions, on economical methods of learning, on 
perception, reasoning and imagination, have been greatly 
changed. The treatments o. individual differences and men- 
tal measurements have been rewritten to include illustrations 
from and applications to diverse fields of interest. Chapter 
III on the Connecting Mechanisms, Chapter X on The Gen- 
eral Laws of Learning, and Chapter XVIII on Intelligence, 
have been less extensively modified. 
The first part of the book deals with the physical basis of 
behavior and conscious activity, since, so far as I have been 
able to learn, instructors are mainly of the opinion that a 
clear, elementary account of these mechanisms is useful or 
essential as a preparation for many problems of psychology 
proper. The treatment of the receiving, connecting, and re- 
acting mechanisms is schematic and brief. Attention is cen- 
tered on the functions rather than the structures of these organs 
and only those facts are presented which bear upon the gen- 
uinely psychological problems that follow.

  vi PREFACE 
In the main body of the text, an effort has been made to 
state the facts of psychology in such a way as to represent 
without bias the important achievements of the past and the 
lines of study being followed at the present time. The results 
both of introspective and objective study have been utilized 
with equal freedom. The book is designed to be a survey 
rather than a system of psychology. 
The book has been written with the limitations of the ele- 
mentary student in mind. The method of development is of 
the spiral type. Certain important topics are touched upon 
first in the treatment of the physical basis of behavior, again 
under native equipment, again during discussion of adjustment 
and learning, and finally under individual differences. Tech- 
nical terms and concise definitions have been used sparingly: 
‘an elementary text should be an exposition of facts rather 
than a dictionary of terms; students should be encouraged to 
understand and utilize ideas rather than to memorize defini- 
tions. 
The book contains more practical applications than is 
usual in an introductory text. This method of illustrating the 
facts in terms of familiar experiences has been adopted deliber- 
ately since psychology has itself demonstrated that this is the 
best way to make the facts intelligible. The beginning stu- 
dent especially needs concrete illustrative detail. Not all of 
the principles and theories familiar to advanced students 
have been included. Some have been omitted because they 
are unimportant or unintelligible to students taking a first 
course and belong properly to advanced study. 
Each chapter is followed by a series of questions and exer- 
cises sufficient in number and, I hope, adequate in character 
to stimulate through individual thinking and group discussion 
a more thorough understanding and utilization of the facts 
than is usually obtained through reading alone. In the first 
chapter are given samples of several types of test exercises and 
questions for review and application. These tests are not 
continued throughout the book for two reasons: the practice 
of making up such exercises for themselves is an excellent form

of study for students; and, for purposes of examination, the 
instructor may make up original lists more suited to his pur- 
poses and his students. In the last section of Chapter I other 
published series of questions and exercises for use in introduc- 
tory courses are mentioned. 
The references at the close of the chapters are of two types: 
“general references” and “references to studies utilized in the 
text.” Each chapter concludes with a list of general refer- 
ences selected for the purpose of enabling the student or in- 
structor to find readily other accounts, especially more exten- 
sive general treatments, of the topics under discussion. ‘Those 
chapters which include summaries of the findings of, or sta- 
tistical data from, particular studies contain references to 
these articles listed at the end. The student or instructor is 
thus enabled to find the sources of all data for purposes of 
verification or amplification of the account in the text. 
Two, methods of reference to authorities or sources of in- 
formation in the body of the text have been adopted. The 
name of the authors of well-known discoveries or theories are 
printed in the usual manner. The names of authors of special 
studies are printed in parentheses, e.g., “Observation of re- 
cently born infants (by Watson) have disclosed——ete.” At 
the end of the chapter, full reference to such a study is given. 
The names presented parenthetically may be considered not 
as items to be mastered by the student but merely as guides 
to further reading—unless the instructor decides otherwise. 
I am grateful to Miss Helene Searcy, Miss Helen Thompson, 
and Miss Dorothy Van Alstyne for splendid assistance in the 
preparation of the manuscript and the reading of proof. My 
obligations are especially heavy to my wife, Dr. Georgina S. 
Gates, whose repeated critical readings of the manuscript have 
made possible improvements of many types.

CHAPTER I 
THE METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER OF 
PSYCHOLOGY 
The subject matter of modern psychology consists 
mainly of a large number of problems concerning human 
behavior which, almost as far back as history is recorded, 
have engaged the attention of thoughtful men. Ancient 
warriors, priests and medicine men, as well as modern 
teachers, lawyers, preachers and salesmen attempt to un- 
* derstand as best they can by reflecting on their own 
impulses, feelings, ideas and acts, and by studying the be- 
aavior of others, the important characteristics of human 
conduct. Thus most people develop, in ways that to 
them seem reasonable, opinions concerning the motives 
that make people willing to buy or work or fight, that 
arouse suspicion, confidence or pleasure, that assuiice 
envy, embarrassment or fear. Most people have acquired 
beliefs concerning the way the mind does and should 
work, concerning the causes of.bad judgment and preju- 
dice, the value of clear “mental pictures” or images, the 
means of improving memory or attention. We have ex- 
planations, too, for the differences in ability to learn 
which school children show, whether they are inborn or 
due to training, to the type of management or teaching 
. 1

secured, whether they foretell similar failure or success in 
athletics, business or morals. We have adopted methods— 
not always clearly understood—of judging traits of body, 
mind and character, such as speed of movement, endur- 
ance, alertness, sensitiveness, sagacity, honesty, ambi- 
tiousness or sociability. We have theories concerning 
mental and temperamental differences between children 
and adults, men and women, Chinese and Negroes. We 
have acquired convictions concerning the effects of pun- 
ishment and praise, of alcohol and tobacco, of the weather 
or noise, upon efficiency in learning or performing. The 
fact that several periodicals which give much space to 
such topics have attained wide circulation indicates that 
most people appreciate the value of the study of these 
problems. For a long time the subject of study by crude 
methods, these topics, together with ieny similar ones, 
when attacked by scientific methods constitute psychol- 
ogy. Since it is the method of study that is the essential 
feature by which psychology is to be distinguished from 
less accurate types of investigation, we should disclose at 
once the characteristics of the scientific method. 
Tue CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ScrenTIFIC METHOD OF 
Securine RELIABLE OBSERVATIONSY 
ne Scientific like Cruder Methods Depends on Ob- 
servation.—The scientific investigator must, like any 
other person, secure his material by observing the activi- 
ties of himself or others. Difficultiésare here encoun- 
tered at once since observation is rarely complete or fully 
accurate. This fact has been demonstrated in many tests. 
For example, a brief scene involving a quarrel which had 
been carefully rehearsed was performed before a group 
of forty professional men. Believing the quarrel genuine 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
° ig 
METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 3 
and anticipating the use of their testimony in court the 
witnesses wrote out a full account. Thirteen of the forty 
observers failed to record as much as half of the impor- 
tant facts and the others had omitted from 20 to 50 per © | 
cent. In addition to the omissions, from 5 to 50 per cent 
of the statements which these professional men were 
willing to submit to a court of law, were erroneous. 
Even when observers are aware of the types of errors 
usually made and when surprise and emotional disturb- 
ances are eliminated by means of warnings and instruc- 
tions—conditions often fulfilled in class experiments in 
experimental psychology—glaring omissions and errors 
persist. Whether the object of observation is a section of 
a moving picture, or an object permitting more deliberate 
study such as a still picture, a stamp or a cigarette pack- 
age the unreliability of ordinary observation is still ap- 
parent. Itis pronounced when the objects of observation 
are facial expressions and bodily attitudes, eye or finger 
movements—witness the ease with which sleight-of-hand 
performers deceive us,—or mental images and other men- 
tal activities important to psychology. The scientific 
worker in psychology, then, must first of all attempt to 
increase the reliability of his observation. 
The Scientific Method Seeks Means of Increasing the 
Reliability of Observation—Inexperience and ee 
tion in the observer ‘and complexity and brevity in the 
events observed are sources of error in the results. The 
scientific worker attempts to improve conditions in all 
of these respects. : , 
Persistent training in observing the particular class of 
events is one requirement. That training, prolonged and 
controlled, does result in improvement is attested by re- 
sults in many fields. Thus the expert musician hears 
overtones and false notes, the artist sees defects of per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-20

spective and color, the wine taster senses slight differ- 
ences in taste and odor, the physician perceives symptoms 
of disease and.health, the mariner sees evidences of storm 
or calm that are unobserved or inaccurately observed by 
the novice. [Training in observation to be effective must 
be specific. The musician by increasing his ability to 
perceive in the field of sound becomes little if any more 
efficient in observing colors, symptoms of disease or of 
weather conditions. Thus for each science training is 
specific; indeed, even within the science, it must be highly 
specialized. The psychologist may become a proficient 
observer of the rapid start and stop movements of the 
eyes in reading without becoming a good witness of the 
facial expressions in emotions, of mental images or the 
mental states involved in reasoning. Since specialized 
training increases the fullness and accuracy of observa- 
tions the scientific method demands trained observers. 
of results, which often springs from preju- 
dice o ¢ © secure evidence favoring a cherished 
belief or theory, is a stumbling block in science as in 
y life. Just as most people are unable to observe 
e of guilt in a person loved, and as persons attend- 
a spiritualist’s séance so often mistake a hazy illu- 
‘mination for the face of a departed friend whose image 
ng been in mind, so scientific workers are likely to be 
influenced by desire and expectation. (Against these 
‘sources of error, the scientific worker must rigidly school 
himself. He must acquire the “scientific attitude,” that 
is, an open-minded, impersonal, unprejudiced attitude 
toward the facts observed.) A few seem to be gifted with 
this attitude by nature, others acquire it only after pro- 
longed and diligent effort. Provisions to secure unpreju- 
diced observations are an important feature of the gen- 
eral methods of science.     
                                 
     
-P-A-G-E-21
    @ i 
°s METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 5 
Since observers, despite diligent training, are rarely 
absolutely accurate and sometimes misled by expectation 
or desire, the scientific method makes provision for repeti- 
tion of observations. It is not sufficient that the investi- 
gator should repeat his own experiment, although this is 
desirable. Before the results of an observation are ac- 
cepted, they must be repeated by others, usually many 
others. To this end, it is customary for the scientific 
worker to report in full, not only the results of his study, 
but also the conditions and procedures so that other 
investigators may set up an identical situation and repeat 
the observation. In this way, errors in observation, 
whether due to prejudice, oversight or other influences, 
may be detected. It will be observed that repetition of 
observations provides an opportunity for the investigator 
to check up his own work and thus learn to do it better, 
and the means by which scientific repute, oes or 3 ig 
may be established. ie 
Errors in observation arise not only ‘because of preju- 
dice and lack of training in the observer, but also because 
of unfavorable conditions. The essential features” of. 
good conditions are isolation of the facts to be observ: od 
and control of all other factors which may conceivably — 
affect the results. To illustrate: from brilliant red — 
     
         
       
    nie     
       
  cut out a cross about four inches long with bars ane 
and a half wide. Place the cross in good light and gazee 
at it steadily for about ten seconds, then look fixedly at 
a wall of gray. After a few seconds a cross of greenish 
tint—the so-called negative after-sensation—will appear. 
Try it again, this time looking away to a wall of green, 
yellow, or some other color, or at an irregular surface, or 
at a corner instead of a flat surface. Try looking at walls 
at different distances, or in light of different intensities. 
It will be found in a series of such tests that:
-P-A-G-E-22
       4 
ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
(1) With practice the after-sensations may be seen 
more clearly. 
(2) Expectations may disturb observation. 
(3) The conditions surrounding the observation influ- 
ence the results. 
| 
To secure trustworthy facts, it is necessary to isolate 
the materials to be observed by removing irrelevant 
objects and distractions, ete., and by controlling other 
conditions, such as the brightness, color, shape, and dis- 
tance of the background to which the after-sensation ap- 
pears to be projected. 
When the investigator is interested in discovering rela- 
tions, causes and effects (as he usually is) as well as 
merely observing particular facts, it becomes absolutely 
essential that all of the factors present be controlled. 
Thus, to ascertain the influence of the vividness of the 
m the character of the negative after- 
® sensation, ld be necessary, not only to perform sey- 
_— tests in which crosses possessing different degrees of 
vividness were presented, but also to have all other condi- 
tions—the time of exposure of the cross, the amount of 
_ light in the room, the character and distance of the walls, 
the physical condition of the eyes and body generally, the 
" afifentiveness of the subject, ete—constant. Similarly. 
© — the influence of any other variable, such as the length of 
fixating the color-cross, could be ascertained by allowing 
- it to vary from test to test while the other factors remain 
the same.. By continuously investigating in this way, 
_ the influences which control certain changes in the dura- 
tion and character of negative after-sensations could be 
certained. 
When the several conditions just described have been 
fulfilled, the procedure is usually called an experiment,     
oe “id:

and the method, experimental. Typically carried out by 
a trained worker, an experiment then is an observation in 
which the facts to be observed have been isolated, all 
other factors have been brought under control, and pro- 
visions have been made so that the whole procedure may 
be repeated by others. An experiment differs from ordi- 
nary observation in that it is more carefully planned and 
executed, is more rigorous, systematic and open to verifi- 
cation by others. . ~\/ 
Mechanical Aids to Observation and Permanent 
Records.—Even under the most carefully controlled con- 
ditions, the finest observers frequently secure results that 
are incomplete and erroneous. Many important events 
are intrinsically elusive or obscure. Much ingenuity has 
therefore been employed in the search for mechanical 
devices designed to supplement or supplant ordinary 
observation. The astronomer utilizing the telescope, and 
the physiologist the microscope, are able to make observa- 
tions more accurate and detailed than could be secured 
by the unaided eye. Especially sought are instruments 
which yield a permanent record that may be studied at 
any time by any person. Instead of the verbal report of 
an investigator concerning the facial expression of fear — 
in an infant, it is better for scientific purposes to have a 
photograph record. Better than a report of the move- 
ment of the eyes in reading is a graphic record obtained 
by use of an apparatus invented for that purpose. In- 
stead of estimating the pulse, respiration and glandular 
changes during excitement, it is better to use mechanical 
devices which yield tracings or chemical changes that may 
be preserved. Advances in psychology, as in other sci- 
ences, have resulted from the invention of instruments 
that have made observation more detailed, accurate and 
extensive,

The Use of Measuring Devices.—Despite all precau- 
tions taken and mechanical aids used in observation, a 
further type of instrument is nearly always useful and 
frequently essential, namely, an objective quantitative 
test or measuring device. It has been found—to illus- 
ate—that the passage of time is judged to be more 
mi when it is filled with interesting activities than 
when one has nothing to do but observe its flow. Two 
intervals, one filled and the other unfilled, which are 
judged to be equal, would in actual fact be unequal. 
Fic. 1—TuHe Two Lines Are Actuatty Equau in LenotH. 
Here then is an error of observation that would be made 
by all observers under the most carefully controlled con- 
ditions; repetition of the experiment would not disclose 
the error but, on the contrary, tend to fix it asa fact. By 
applying an instrument, a watch, which yields an objec- 
tive measure of the two intervals, the truth is discovered. 
Above are two lines which nearly every one would judge 
as unequal, but by applying a foot-rule, their exact 
lengths, which are equal, will be disclosed. Practice in 
observing many situations of such types as these will: 
result in improvement, but only when the successes and 
errors are made apparent by an objective measurement or 
some other objective device. Even where such gross 
blunders as these are unlikely, measuring devices are often 
   
-P-A-G-E-25

essential to yield observations that are sufficiently re- 
fined for scientific purposes. Rough estimations of height, 
as tall, medium, short; of heat as hot, warm, cold, and the 
like, may satisfy many everyday needs, but for scientific 
purposes distance often must be measured in thousandths 
of an inch and heat in thousandths of a degree. 
In psychology, as in other sciences, the need of objec- 
tive measuring devices is acute and great progress in 
knowledge has followed many inventions already made. 
Many of the devices are adaptations of instruments used 
in other sciences: the timing clocks for measuring the 
speed with which a person may react by speech or finger 
movement to a sound, electric shock or flash of light; 
electric mechanisms which measure intensities of changés 
in glands of the skin, and graphic devices for measuring 
the frequency and duration of eye movements during 
reading or following the outline of a circle. Other meas- 
uring devices have originated in psychology itself, and 
constitute some of its outstanding achievements: the 
development of scales for measuring general intelligence, 
aptitudes for music and mechanical work, and for meas- 
uring achievement in vocational, scholastic and artistic 
activities. Where measuring devices have not been per- 
fected, as for many complex human traits such as those 
indicated by such terms as initiative, ambitiousness, ex- 
citability, knowledge of their genesis stl role in daily life 
remains inexact. 
The Use of Statistical Methods.—The early applica- 
tions of measuring instruments to human beings disclosed 
at once the fact that individuals differ greatly. To dis- 
close adequately any characteristic of the race as a whole, 
it is, therefore, necessary to measure not merely one but 
many representatives, properly selected. The necessity 
of portraying and easily handling groups of measures led

                 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
development of statistical methods. Every com- 
-petent student of psychology must now have some 
familiarity with, if not a mastery of, such methods. 
These methods are necessary because one constantly en- 
counters such problems as: How many girls and boys, 
properly selected, must be measured by an intelligence 
test before a statement concerning sex differences in gen- 
eral may be advanced? If a hundred boys have been 
_ measured, how great is the probable difference between 
the average of their performance and the average based 
on a million boys, similarly selected and measured? Sta- 
tistical methods assist in answering such questions. The 
application of measuring instruments to human activities 
has disclosed another fact—the same individual varies 
appreciably in quality and rate of performance from mo- 
ment to moment. To secure a truly representative meas- 
ure of a person, therefore, it may be necessary either to 
ive several tests at intervals or to test continuously for 
as time at one sitting. A half dozen trials in a 
_ test of the speed with which a subject can react to a sharp 
sound by jerking his finger from an electric switch key 
may be insufficient to portray his average or typical abil- 
‘ ; a three-minute test in assembling mechanical con- 
vances may be insufficient to disclose his aptitude in 
hat kind of mechanical work. By the application of 
statistical methods, the reliability of a measurement— 
how adequately it portrays an individual’s average or 
“normal” performance—may be ascertained. 
These are but samples of the uses of statistical methods 
which now form a part of the program for accuracy and 
precision in the scientific study of human behavior. 
Summary.—The scientific method of study embraces a 
_ number of features which aim to increase the reliability, 
Gate and minuteness of observation.

   GENERALIZING FROM THE Facrs OpsErvep. 
Science Attempts to Explain Its Observed Facts.— 
Thus far, the discussion has been confined mainly to the 
errors of observation and the devices utilized to avoid or 
remove them. The accumulation of trustworthy observa- 
tions or particular facts is but one phase of the work o 
science. Equally important and equally difficult is t 
interpretation of facts, the development of general la 
and principles. When Benjamin Franklin flew his kite 
in a thunder-storm, he observed a phenomenon, an elec- 
trie spark jumping from the cord. Verified on other 
occasions, it was recognized as a fact. When Franklin 
stated as a result of his observations that lightning was 
merely a huge electric spark, he had gone beyond the 
observable facts. He had developed an hypothesis which 
‘was borne out by later investigations and finally accepted 
as a general principle, a law or general truth.

12 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
An. hypothesis is any conception by means of which 
the mind goes beyond the facts and seeks to establish 
relations between data that have been observed. ,It is a 
conjecture, a guess, a provisional explanation; it is an 
~ interpretation or enlargement of what is observed. The 
development of hypotheses is one of the important feat- 
® ures of scientific work. The ability to generalize or 
theorize has been the outstanding characteristic of most 
eminent men of science. Conjecturing, guessing, theoriz- 
~ ing, is not confined to any one period of an investigation ; 
it is usually incessantly active, preceding, accompanying, 
f following and guiding all experimentation.    
          
    
    
    
    
    
    
         
Differences in interpretation are usual; everywhere are 
encountered rival hypotheses which must eventually be 
evaluated not only on the basis of further observations 
but also in the light of certain principles of guidance in 
interpretation. Just as there are checks, controls and 
accepted rules to guide observation, so there are devices 
- for avoiding errors and reaching the most effective con- 
clusions in thinking about facts collected. It is quite as 
difficultto think validly as to observe accurately. The 
scientific method, consequently, comprises a. series of 
i rules, all of the rules of logic and in addition certain 
others that are designed to guide the construction gf 
hypotheses. 
Science Favors the Hypothesis Which Has the 
Widest Application——Other things being equal, science 
accepts the hypothesis which explains the most, which 
has the widest application. Psychology, for example, 
seeks a single formula by means of which to explain 
the mechanics of all behavior, both of body and mind, 
in normal and abnormal individuals, in animals as well 
as man. It favors one type of explanation for learn- 
ing of all sorts, swimming, singing, control of anger,      
             
       
     
        
                
-P-A-G-E-29
  é ® . METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 
memorizing, solving geometry problems, rather than one 
set of hypotheses for acquiring muscular skills, another 
for modifying emotions, and another for accumulating 
information. Rival hypotheses are being constantly 
tested by application to new particular facts as they 
appear. That hypothesis which explains, most ade- 
quately and widely, the known facts is the one most 
acceptable to science. : 
Science Favors the Simplest Explanation; the Law 
of Parsimony.—Of several rival hypotheses, equally good 
in other respects, science favors the one which affords the 
simplest explanation. In one form or another, this rule, 
which is known as the Law of Parsimony, has been ac- 
cepted by all sciences. What shall be meant by sim- 
plicity must be determined by each science for itself. 
In psychology, the Law of Parsimony has been, for many 
purposes, quite satisfactorily stated in what is known as 
Lloyd Morgan’s Canon, which is here quoted from his 
“Introduction to Comparative Psychology” (1894): “In 
no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the 
exercise of a higher psychical faculty (mental process) if 
it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of 
one which stands lower in the psychological scale.” To 
illustrate Lloyd Morgan’s Canon, let us suppose that our 
dog, caught in the forbidden pantry, cowers and whines 
piteously. What are the possible explanations of such 
conduct? Since the dog has been carefully trained to 
keep away from the pantry, and is an intelligent and well 
meaning animal, he is suffering pangs of conscience. One 
can discern remorse and penitence in his tones; he simply 
regrets the sinfulness of his ways. Another ccobeaucl & 
_might be this: when the master happens upon the dog, 
the animal consciously remembers—has in fact a vivid 
mental picture—of what happened when he was last sur-     
ie we 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
ee 
14 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
prised in the pantry. On the basis of this memory 
revival, it was easy to reason what would probably be 
shortly forthcoming, hence the cowering and whining. A 
third explanation would be: the dog has for good reasons 
cowered and whined when previously caught in the 
pantry. Now, being confronted by the man-pantry situ- 
ation, he reacts by cowering and whining, a direct motor 
reaction unattended by “conscience,” “reason,” “con- 
scious memory,” or any other “higher’ 
  ” mental process. 
The psychologist would probably accept the last explana- 
tion (or one somewhat like it) because it is simplest in 
the sense of being lowest in the scale of psychological 
explanation. | 
Psychology more than most sciences must be rigid in 
applying the Law of Parsimony, because fanciful and 
mystical explanations are supplied with such readiness. 
bi lepathy, Baind reading, mystic iepiraliens, premonitidns, 
intuitions, and mind cures is illustrative of the readiness 
with which the supernatural rather than the simplest of 
psychological explanations are accepted. A New Eng- 
land girl, Beulah Miller, found herself possessed of a 
mysterious ability to divine many of her mother’s 
thoughts; for example, she could tell whether her mother 
was thinking about the clock, the carpet, or the window, 
about the number 6 or 10. The girl was entirely ignorant 
of the means by which she accomplished these feats. 
While thought transference, independent of the channels 
of the ordinary senses, is suggested by such a perform- 
ance, the psychologist must search for simpler explana- 
tions. In this case it was found after careful investiga- 
tion that the girl, without knowing it herself, was getting 
her cues from slight eye, lip, or bodily movements of the 
mother who was not aware of having made them.    
-P-A-G-E-31
METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 15 
The Use of Laws in Prediction.—Guided by rules, 
samples of which have been suggested, hypotheses are 
formulated, tried out to be discarded or to be advanced 
to the stage of a recognized theory, and if fully verified, 
to be finally accepted as a law, principle or general truth. 
Laws or principles are what sciences eagerly seek. The 
prime value of the general law is that it provides the 
means of making predictions, explaining all manner of 
particular facts, and foretelling consequences. The 
astronomer utilizing the laws concerning the movement 
of planets can predict the exact moment at which the sun 
will rise each day for many years in the future. The 
physician observing certain symptoms, pulse, tempera- 
ture, and the locus of pain, by virtue of known principles 
predicts, with more or less accuracy, the course of a 
disease and arranges the treatment accordingly. The 
psychologist, utilizing the principles of mental growth, 
predicts, at least roughly, from the results of an exam- 
ination made at age seven, the degree of mentality that 
a particular pupil will possess at fifteen, and as such 
predictions become more precise, the educational and 
vocational treatment of children may be more adequately 
selected and controlled to suit the ability and needs of 
the particular individual. In so far as we are able to 
predict the future from the present, we may be able to 
meet the future more adequately. Prediction is an ulti- 
mate aim of scientific endeavor. 
Summary.—The scientific method is the result of ex- 
tensive study of the difficulties and pitfalls in observation 
and the defects and deficiencies in generalizing ‘from 
observed facts. It comprises improved methods both of 
observing and generalizing from data observed. ’Scien- 
tific knowledge differs from “popular” ideas mainly~in 
these respects: it is

(1) More definite and precise. 
(2) More accurate and valid 
(3) Better analyzed and organized. 
(4) More universal in application. 
The essence of science is its method. What dis- 
tinguishes one science from another is the subject matter 
studied. Psychology is a science so long as it abides by 
the rules and regulations of the scientific game. Psychol- 
ogy, then, is the application of the methods of science to 
the study of certain data. What the data are and how 
they yield to or resist scientific attack should receive 
brief consideration.

Sample Problems.—Conceived broadly, psychology 
seeks to discover the general laws which explain the 
behavior of living organisms: It attempts to identify, 
describe and classify the several types of activity of 
which the animal, human or other, is capable. Psychol- 
ogy endeavors to ascertain what bodily organs are en- 
gaged in locomotion, in vocalization, in approaching and 
avoiding objects, in angry and affectionate behavior, in 
seeking escape from dangerous or difficult surroundings, 
and, in the case of human beings, at least, in reading, 
recalling facts, ‘perceiving distance, or reasoning out the 
solution of a problem. It seeks to determine which of 
the many forms of activity or abilities appear without 
learning; which like the breathing of a newly-born infant 
are the results of inner growth rather than training. 
Psychology also seeks to determine the principles which 
explain the process of learning in the case of abilities 
which are acquired or modified by means of experience. 
(It seeks to discover whether the principles of economy in
-P-A-G-E-33
METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 17 
learning are the same or different in the acquisition of 
motor (ie., muscular) skills, knowledge about objects 
and events, emotional control, appreciations, and other 
types of learning. Psychology attempts to discover the 
amount and nature of differences between species—cats, 
monkeys and men—and the differences among members 
of the same species in mental and motor abilities, native 
and acquired, in methods of adjustment to their environ- 
ment, in capacities to learn, in fact, in all phases of their 
conduct. 
Study of Behavior by “Objective” Methods.—In all 
of these endeavors, psychology seeks to discover and 
utilize the means of study which most closely approxi- 
mate the thoroughly scientific method. ‘When the sub- 
ject of investigation is another person or animal whose 
activities, such as movements of hand or limb, facial 
expressions, or vocalizations, may be observed directly or 
by the aid of recording or measuring devices, psychology 
may utilize’ precisely the methods of other natural sci- 
ences—physics, chemistry or botany. The behavior of a 
man or animal may: be studied quite as directly and 
scientifically as the bending of a steel rod under weight, 
the activities in a mixture of chemicals or the movements 
of the petals of a flower shifted from darkness to light. 
_ Just as in other sciences, all of the devices and precau- 
tions, which form the essence of the scientific method, 
may be utilized in the study of human and animal be- 
havior. When the investigator restricts himself to obser- 
vations of movements of limbs, eyes or facial muscles, to 
observations or records of vocal expressions, glandular 
activities or secretions which may be directly observed, 
recorded by an instrument or analyzed chemically; when, 
in sum, the investigator observes features of the beliavior 
of an animal or man which other investigators could also
-P-A-G-E-34
  18 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
study—were they present—the method is termed 
objective. 
Study of Consciousness by the Method of Introspec- 
tion.—We must now raise the question whether all the 
facts which may be useful in describing and explaining 
the behavior of man or animals can be observed in this 
objective way; whether all the facts may be observed by 
several investigators. It is at once apparent that there 
are many activities or experiences in human life, at least, 
that are limited entirely to one person. In this category 
fall the facts of consciousness, those conscious experiences 
that are exclusively individual or subjective. As I now 
write these words, I become aware of a slight pain from 
a bruise on my foot, of the initial pangs of hunger, of the 
desire to finish this section of the discussion before lunch. 
I am aware of strivings to make this discussion clear, and 
as I attempt to secure relevant facts, I recall vague 
visual impressions of persons who have written on the 
same subject. No one else can share these observations; 
no one can verify them. What is more, no one can record 
them by graphic or photographie devices, by chemical 
analysis or in any other way. They are open only to my 
observation; they are purely subjective. There are, then, 
some facts in human experience that cannot be studied in 
exactly the way required to satisfy completely the de- 
mands of the scientific method. These are the facts of 
personal conscious experience—sensations, such as tooth- 
ache, muscular strains or coldness, feelings of pleasant- 
ness or unpleasantness, recalled images and ideas, im- 
pulses to run or weep, desires, motives, and other con- 
scious data. The observation of such personal experi- 
ences is usually termed subjective or introspective; the 
method is termed the introspective method to distinguish 
it from the objective type of observation.
-P-A-G-E-35
METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 19 
There is little doubt that a valid description, classifica- 
tion and explanation of such conscious experiences would 
be of great value to psychology in its efforts to explain 
human behavior in general. Everyone knows as the 
result of ordinary experiences that bodily sensations, 
feelings, emotions, images, memories, and impulses are 
associated with and conditioned by overt (that is, open- 
to-view) conduct. The better we know the nature of 
conscious life the more fully we may be able to under- 
stand and predict all behavior. Indeed, the common 
sense view is that the task of isolating the different phases 
of conscious experiences, of relating them to bodily 
organs, of discovering the. relation of one to others and 
the functions of each in the behavior of the organism, 
as a whole, lies rather exclusively within the province of 
psychology. This view is entirely correct. Psychology 
must accept the responsibility of doing all that may be 
done to describe and explain the facts of mental life in 
order that they may be related to the facts of behavior 
as a whole. 
A Typical Problem for Introspection.—The difficulties 
of obtaining reliable observations of conscious experience 
may be appreciated better after attempting a fairly com- 
plex type of introspective study. You may try an experi- 
ment, now classic, first described by the eminent scientist, 
Sir Francis Galton? Seat yourself comfortably and try to 
recall as vividly as you can the morning’s breakfast table. 
Can you see, in our mind’s eye, the table, dishes, faces, 
food, and other details? Are these visual images dim or 
clear? Are they as bright as the actual scene? Can you 
really imagine the colors of the china, of the toast, eggs, 
coffee, etc., quite distinctly? Can you imagine the whole - 
scene at once? For example, can you imagine all four 
walls of the room at once, or only the area that you could 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
    20 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
see from the particular position in the room? Where do 
the images seem to be situated? Within the head, within 
the eyeball, just in front of the eyes, or at a place corre- 
sponding to the real situation of the room? Can you 
retain the image steadily? With or without effort? Can 
you project it to the wall? ‘ 
Methods for Increasing Reliability of Introspective 
Study.—Such observations are difficult because the con- 
scious data are usually complex, unstable and shifting. 
It is difficult to concentrate fully on the images, to the 
exclusion of everything else seen, heard, recalled or felt, 
and at the same time, introspectively study the charac- 
teristics of the images. Conscious experiences of this and 
many other sorts are intrinsically difficult to observe. To 
bring introspective study as nearly as possible to the 
scientific ideal, the usual precautions are taken. The 
investigator should obtain favorable conditions for study 
by working when and where free of distractions. He 
should, moreover, secure abundant training in setting 
himself to the particular task of holding rigidly to it. — 
In this type of observation as in others, increased skill 
may be achieved through rigorous training. Expertness 
is possible here and in other fields. The investigator 
should repeat an observation and record the results, which 
then may be given statistical treatment. Since no one’s 
mental images can be objectified or made accessible to 
_ other observers, psychology must rely upon the careful- 
ness, expertness and trustworthiness of the individual 
observer. 
Some there are in the ranks of psychology who distrust 
the validity of the introspective method because of the 
limitations which have been mentioned. The majority 
approve its use while recognizing the need of care and 
caution. Those who favor it contend that if similar
-P-A-G-E-37
  METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 21 
experiences are reported by different people independ- 
ently, or if the same observer, known to be well trained, 
careful and trustworthy, has the same.experience re- 
peatedly, the observation should be considered reliable 
quite as other types of experimental evidence. In Gal- 
ton’s experiment, for example, many trustworthy indi- 
viduals repeatedly found that their imagery of the break- 
fast table was “brilliant, distinct, never blotchy,” others 
found it “fairly clear, brightness at least from one-half to 
two-thirds of the original,” while others found their 
imagery to be “zero—no visual memories—recollect but 
do not see the scene.” These reports are at once of 
useful reliability and in rough quantitative terms. The 
investigator may arrange a “scale” in which the highest 
degree of vividness is connected with the lowest by a 
number of steps or units which are roughly equal. 
Introspective study is admittedly difficult, and unusual 
care must be exercised in utilizing the results of its use. 
It is the only mode of approach to some important prob- 
lems and psychology must accept the task of demon- 
strating whether the method in the hands of experts 
yields evidence sufficiently reliable for scientific purposes. 
Typss or INDIVIDUALS STUDIED. 
The Study of Normal Human Adults.—In general 
psychology, interest tends to center in the normal human 
adult. By the “normal” adult is meant a person, 18 or 
more years old, without conspicuous defects or defi- 
ciencies. Studies of consciousness have been confined 
almost entirely to adults, indeed, mainly to experienced 
psychologists and college students at various stages of 
practice in introspective study. As subjects of the more- 
refined methods of objective study embracing the feat- 
ures of the experimental method, college students and
-P-A-G-E-38
22 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
  instructors have also been chiefly utilized. Since these 
are rather select groups in some respects,—for example, 
in intelligence,—there is always some danger that the 
obtained results will be not typical of all mankind. As 
far as possible, these results are checked up by observa- 
tions of other people, dull, average and bright, in the 
varied activities of everyday life as well as by more 
precise investigation in the laboratory. In addition, 
checks and controls are often obtained from studies of 
abnormal adults and of children and animals, both normal 
and abnormal. ; 
The Study of Children.Children from birth to ma- 
turity are studied not only to provide an understanding 
of their behavior, but also to make more intelligible the 
behavior of adults. Adult behavior evolves from, and 
is influenced by, the growth and experiences of earlier 
life. Tracing from year to year the development of bodily - 
organs and their functions, intelligence, skills, emotional 
tendencies and moral habits by consecutive observations 
and measurements is an important phase of psychological 
study. This type of investigation is often called the 
genetic method. 
For some purposes, children are admirable subjects, 
for others, they are quite unsuitable. The introspective 
reports during early childhood are not highly reliable and 
the study of consciousness by subjective methods is un- 
trustworthy. For objective study children’s behavior 
offers certain advantages—it is often less complex and 
less distorted by unknown past experiences than that of 
adults. Since their likes and dislikes, fears and angers, 
impulses to strike or eat, their motives in general are 
less frequently and skillfully concealed, their observable 
behavior is a better index of the full adjustment of the 
organism. The processes of learning to walk, talk, handle 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 23 
implements, read or solve problems, may be studied 
profitably since they form slowly and may be traced from 
the beginning. The development of instrumental aids to 
observation and measuring devices for use with children 
has been specially extensive and successful. Indeed, so 
far as quantitative study is concerned the equipment for 
dealing with children is now superior to that for investi- 
gation upon adults. 
The Study of Animals.“Since there are reasons for 
believing that human behavior, like the human body, has 
evolved from and is therefore in many respects similar 
to, even if more complex than, animal behavior the study 
of animals has been prosecuted with results of value in 
interpreting human conduct. For the fruitfulness of 
such study there are four important reasons. First, the 
behavior of animals is usually more simple. When ani- 
mals are encouraged to learn, the slowness and obvious- 
ness of their progress makes detailed observation possible. 
Here the processes of learning in its simplest terms may 
be detected yielding principles that may be applied to 
explain human habit formation. Indeed, some of the 
important generalizations concerning human learning 
have originated in just this way. Another advantage of 
animal study, in some instances, lies in the brevity of 
the span of life. 1 that an average rat, for example, 
does and learns from birth to senility may be observed in 
about 30 months, the normal life of some species of this 
animal. The study of animals affords another important 
advantage; their activities, more than those of human 
subjects, may be controlled more completely and for 
longer periods, even for a lifetime. An investigator may 
not refuse the child its privilege of attempting to walk 
until months past the usual time in order to ascertain to 
what degree walking is a result of inner growth as con-

  24 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
trasted with practice, nor may he isolate the child from 
human intercourse to discover what type of vocalization, 
if any, would result, but birds may be comfortably housed 
so as to prevent practice in flying or in imitating the 
songs of other birds until a time well beyond the time 
when these activities normally appear. In this way 
important facts concerning the inherited or instinctive 
equipment of animals may be learned. , Another advan- 
tage in the use of animals as subjects is the possibility of 
observing as a result of operation the loss or distortion of 
activities which follows the removal of organs. Thus by 
extirpation of parts of the brain of animals much has 
been learned of the function of that complex organ. 
Observation of animals must be wholly objective, of 
course; consciousness cannot be directly studied. At 
best, it may be indirectly inferred from the animal’s be- 
havior, but such practice is too uncertain to yield much 
of value for interpreting the human mind. 
The Study of Abnormal Individuals.—Among animals, 
children and adults, individuals that deviate widely from 
the average either by inherited aptitude or deficiency or 
by acquired ability or defect prove to be fruitful subjects 
for study not only because it is important to understand 
them but also because they often disclose in clear relief 
the normal réle of organs and functi®ns. Studies of the 
blind and deaf and of patients whose brains or spinal 
cords-have been partly destroyed by accident or disease 
have contributed greatly to the knowledge of functions of 
these organs. In feeble-minded children, criminal adults, 
the emotionally or nervously unstable, the insane, the 
usual human functions are often found either in such 
limited or exaggerated degree that they are more readily 
isolated from other functions than in the normal. Simi- 
larly profitable studies have been made of the extremely

bright child, the lightning-calculator, the champion 
typist, the master musician, mechanic or executive as 
well as of instances of exceptional memory, imagery and 
sensory acuteness. 
VARIETIES OF PsyCHOLOGY. 
The field of psychology is so broad and the methods 
and interests of its workers are so numerous that it is cus- 
tomary for the sake of convenience to indicate sub- 
divisions or varieties. It is sometimes divided broadly, 
according to predominant method of attack, into 
(1) The study of consciousness which is usually called 
Introspective Psychology. 
(2) The study of behavior, which is called either Ob- 
jective Psychology or Behavioristic Psychology. 
Other divisions are often made according to the type 
of subjects studied. Thus arise such varieties as Animal 
Psychology, Child Psychology, Human Adult Psychology, 
Abnormal Psychology. Certain limited phases of the 
general. subject which may not be confined to either of 
the general methods of attack or to any class of indi- 
viduals are often giyen special names. Thus we have 
Physiological Psychology, in which the main items of in- 
terest are the form and functions of the bodily organs 
including the nervous system and the relation of these to 
mental and bodily activities; Dynamic Psychology, in 
which the springs of action, motives, drives, urges, wants, 
as they are variously called, are especially stressed; Social 
Psychology, in which the activity of the individual— 
animal, child or adult, normal or abnormal—in his rela- 
tions to other individuals of the same species is studied; 
Differential Psychology, in which the amount, kind and
-P-A-G-E-42
  26 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
significance of individual differences are the main objects 
of inquiry. The varieties enumerated do not exhaust the 
list but they indicate the fact that there are many fields 
for specialization of interests with a great deal of over- 
lapping among many of the branches. 
Applied Psychology.—Applied Psychology is some- 
times stated to be, not a branch or variety of the general 
science, but an art of putting psychological facts and 
principles to work for practical ends. The fields to which 
applications may thus be made are almost innumerable; 
to industrial work, to business in general, or to advertis- 
ing, buying, selling, selecting employes; to the practice 
of medicine, law, and education; to religious, social or 
philanthropic work, etc. To apply psychology to these 
and other practical activities, however, rarely: fails to 
assist the general science and often becomes an impor- 
tant part of it, in two ways. The deficiencies or merits 
of hypotheses are disclosed by applying them to new 
situations. This is the way in which valid laws and 
principles are built up; and this is precisely what Applied 
Psychology does. Thus we find that the use of tests of 
mental imagery and the wider use of tests of general 
intelligence in school, business and industry by com- 
petent hands has added greatly to our understanding of 
certain aspects of human nature. Bain the workers in 
Applied Psychology rarely find principles sufficient to 
solve all their particular problems. These problems are 
then often attacked by methods like those utilized in the 
general science. The result may be a body of new ex- 
perimental data by which the science itself is enriched. 
General Psychology.—From the many fields of study, 
with a diversity of particular methods, subjects and in- 
terests, have been gathered a body of facts, hypotheses 
and principles which constitute General Psychology.
-P-A-G-E-43
  METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 27 
General Psychology is a group of facts and principles 
which purport to explain the behavior of living organisms 
in general. |The term behavior is here used broadly to 
include the characteristic features of such reactions as 
man and other animals may make in adjusting to their 
surroundings, in getting along in their world. 
This book treats of certain phases of General Psychol- 
ogy with particular emphasis upon the explanation of 
human behavior. It is called Elementary Psychology 
since it is not an exhaustive treatment; it omits especially 
the more highly technical phases of the subject. 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
Following each chapter is a group of exercises and questions de- 
signed to assist students in clarifying and testing their mastery of the 
text and to stimulate application of the facts to other situations. 
Free discussions of the exercises by students in small groups will be 
specially fruitful. Among the questions following the first few chap- 
ters are examples of several of the new types of objective tests now 
profitably.used in many places. They afford rapid and comprehen- 
sive tests of the important points in the chapter. Tests of these 
types are not continued through the book inasmuch as to make up 
such exercises is as valuable as to solve them. It is suggested that 
each member of a study group make up a list of such exercises for 
each chapter and give them to the other members. Such a practice 
will provide most effective study and review. Samples of several 
types of exercises follow.

What is the distinction between introspection and reasoning or 
philosophizing? 
Which of the following experiments would necessarily be studied

anger increases one’s mental acuity; (b) whether anger is pleasant 
or unpleasant; (c) whether a dog is angry or not; (d) whether 
a dog can see colors; (e) whether a man can see colors; 
(£) whether the color preferences of women are the same as those 
of men; (g) whether one can really imagine the taste of sweet; 
(h) whether alcohol affects one’s vision.

ter several times during the course of a week to ascertain whether 
any perceptible improvement in this type of observation results. 
Try the experiment with children of different ages. Do you 
think they could become reliable observers in this field? If so, 
at about what age? 
How would the facts concerning the unreliability of observation 
probably apply to your recollection of the materials in this chap- 
ter after a first reading? Do you suppose it possible that some 
of the material might be quite incorrectly recalled? How would 
you arrange to test the reliability of your observation and mem- 
ory for such facts experimentally? How determine the number 
of readings necessary for reasonably full and accurate recall? 
What is the distinction between a civil law and a scientific law? - 
What are the differences between a jury trial and a scientific test 
of facts? Does modern legal practice take into account in any 
way the methods that science finds useful? 
At this point, spend a few minutes running through the table of 
contents—as a substitute for a precise definition of psychology, 
which the writer has not attempted in this chapter—and then 
scrutinize each of the following definitions to see which ones, if 
any, most adequately embrace the topics to be taken up in this 
book. Which ones seem too narrow or too broad in scope.

human activity and conduct as its subject matter.” (J. B. 
Watson) 
d. “Psychology is the science which deals with the mutual inter-

  CHAPTER IT 
THE ROLE OF THE RECEIVING MECHANISM IN 
BEHAVIOR EXPLAINED AS REACTIONS 
As we observed in the preceding chapter, each science 
attempts to develop broad principles by means of which 
its particular facts may be explained. Until undisputably 
established, such general explanations are properly 
termed hypotheses or “working hypotheses.” The good 
hypothesis must fulfill certain requirements. It must 
faithfully explain the particular facts on which it is 
based; it must be wide in its application, explaining all 
the facts within its field; it must afford the most simple 
and workable explanation and it is furthermore desirable ~ 
that it should square up with facts and principles estab- 
lished in other fields, such as physiology or physics. 
Before undertaking the detailed problems of psychology 
it is desirable, therefore, to present in brief a working 
hypothesis which is fundamental in all later explanations. 
This will give the main point of view that will be elab- 
orated and substantiated throughout the book. : 
Tue Reaction HypotrHesis 
Briefly, the hypothesis is as follows: all forms of human 
behavior, whether muscular activities, such as grasping, 
walking and speaking; glandular activities, such as the 
secretion of tears, saliva and bile; or mental activities, 
such as seeing, hearing, becoming afraid or angry;recol- 
lecting or imagining, are reactions to definite stimuli. 
This may be called the reaction hypothesis: 
32
-P-A-G-E-49
  RECEIVING MECHANISM IN BEHAVIOR 33 
Muscular Movements Are Reactions.—If a sharp pin- 
point is applied to an earthworm, a dog, an infant or an 
unsuspecting adult, the usual result is a sudden and pro- 
nounced movement. The essential features of this bit 
of behavior are, the stimulus, the reaction or response 
and some sort of connection between the two. The stim- 
ulus here is an activity or force which manifestly, has 
some effect upon the organism; which arouses the organ- 
ism—at least some part of it—to activity. 
The stimulus to produce effectively a reaction must 
impinge on some sensitive portion of the body. The pin, 
in this case, was brought to bear upon one or more tiny 
sense organs which were located in or under the skin. 
Since the movements made in response to the stimulus 
were not all located immediately at the point of stimula- 
tion it is apparent that the effects of the stimulus on the 
sense organ were conducted over various distances to the 
“ muscles. Examination, indeed, would disclose between 
sense organs and muscles an elaborate system of connec- 
tions, the cells and fibres of the nervous system. It is a 
nerve impulse initiated at the sense organ by the stimulus 
and conducted through a system of nerve fibres (first 
to centers in the spinal cord or brain and thence back) 
which touches off the reaction in the muscles. The 
reaction, in this case a movement, is an activity produced 
by the release or transformation of energy. A muscular 
movement or “motor response” is due to the sudden 
release of forms of energy stored in the muscle. 
A reaction, as the term is here used, means more than 
the mere transmission of energy from one object to 
another as when a moving billiard ball, striking another, 
throws the latter into action. The amount of energy 
released or transformed may be very much greater than 
the amount transmitted to the organism by the stimulus.
-P-A-G-E-50
  34 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
A tiny prick occasioned by a very small amount of force 
may cause a reaction in which a relatively huge amount 
of energy is consumed, or more accurately, transformed. 
The organism contains at all times stored in various re- 
acting mechanisms large amounts of energy which when 
released by appropriate stimulation occasion the body’s 
activity. 
That all motor activities are to be explained in terms 
of the stimulus-reaction formula is generally agreed since 
the mechanisms involved, the sensory or receiving mech- 
anisms, the connection mechanisms and the reacting 
mechanisms, in this case the muscles, are fairly well un- 
derstood and their combined activity may be observed 
with relative ease. In everyday experience we observe 
that a tickle causes a quiver or a sneeze; a pinch causes 
a jerk, a strong light causes a wink or the narrowing of 
the pupil of the eye. In the laboratory such simple re- 
actions may be more precisely demonstrated, and in many 
cases the sense organs, nerves and muscles involved may 
be identified. The more complex motor activities such 
as talking, grasping an object, balancing on one foot, 
stopping a “grounder,” playing a violin, although im- 
mensely more complicated both on the side of the stim- 
ulus and the response, nevertheless are of the same 
character as the more simple acts. 
Glandular Activities Are Reactions.—If a strong light 
or a cinder strikes the eye the muscles of the lid react 
causing a wink; the eye may also be promptly moistened 
by a flow of tears. The tears, like movements, are the 
results of a reaction; the reacting mechanism in this case 
being a gland—the lachrymal gland. In a similar way 
heat will cause the sweat glands to react, a taste of sweet 
the salivary, and certain substances in the stomach, the 
digestive glands. In the simplest instances, then, gland-
-P-A-G-E-51

RECEIVING MECHANISM IN BEHAVIOR 35 
ular activities are brought forth by stimuli which affect 
sense organs within the body or on its surface. While 
muscles and glands may differ greatly in structure and 
while movements and chemical secretions are very dif- 
ferent sorts of products both are similarly produced in 
the sense that they are the results of reactions of bodily 
mechanisms activated in an orderly way by stimuli.» —, 
Conscious Experiences Are Reactions.—When the 
human subject is stimulated by a pin prick, a ray of 
light or a sweet substance characteristic muscular and 
glandular reactions occur and the subject becomes con- 
scious of the pain, the light or the sweet taste. Since 
these sensations are purely personal experiences not ap- 
parent to other observers they are often conceived as 
rather mysterious activities differing in kind and control 
from movements and glandular secretions. It appears, 
however, that they followed upon and were activated by 
the stimulation of sense organs. They seem to appear as 
surely and uniformly and to be as law-abiding as the 
others. In these instances, at least, they may intelligibly 
be conceived as reactions. More complex conscious ex- 
periences similarly are reactions; that is, they are not 
spontaneously brought into existence but aroused by 
definite causes. When pricked by a pin the subject is 
first aware of the pain; that is, he experiences a sensation 
but at once he may realize that the pain was caused by 
a pin—he perceives the pin. The event, furthermore, 
may arouse some resentment or anger, an emotional re- 
sponse; it may lead to the recollection of the cirecum- 
stances that led to the unfortunate location of the pin, 
to imagination of serious consequences which may result 
from even so slight an accident, to reflection or reasoning 
as to the means of forestalling such results. Thus to a 
simple stimulus conscious reactions of all sorts, simple and
-P-A-G-E-52
Pe ee Te ee e 36 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
complex, may be made. They do not appear without 
some adequate cause; they are, like movements and secre- 
tions, the result of the activities of mechanisms within 
the body. 
On first encountering the reaction hypothesis as thus 
briefly sketched students are likely to raise the objection 
that the concept is altogether too mechanical; it suggests 
human behavior that is too completely fixed, inflexible, 
invariable; too little influenced by varying conditions of 
attention, mood, desire, and purpose. Fit descriptions 
these—it may be suggested—for gasoline motors or even 
for plants and simple animals but not for man whose 
behavior no one can predict. Now these objections reveal 
the need of giving further emphasis to the number and 
complexity of the stimuli which are operating and to- 
gether determine the reactions at any moment. The fact 
seems to be that human behavior is not inexplicable and 
irreducible to law and order, it is merely exceedingly 
complex. 
Typical Human Reactions Are Complex.—Since 
human behavior is typically complex both when observed 
from the point of view of the reaction and of the stim- 
ulus the need of discovering the elementary principles 
involved becomes acute. A suitable problem for psychol- 
ogy—to illustrate—is the child’s reading or his learning 
to read. Delicate eye and head movements as he follows 
the line may be observed; muscular reactions that are 
quite difficult to acquire. Genuine reading, of course, 
involves conscious reactions. The child must recognize 
the words, which also takes time and effort to learn. More 
than recognition, genuine reading includes comprehension 
of the ideas and at its best reflection or thought beyond 
mere comprehension. Nor is this all. The child now 
laughs with glee, now trembles with excitement or, if it
-P-A-G-E-53
  RECEIVING MECHANISM IN BEHAVIOR 37 
is a good ghost story, shrinks and pales with fear. Exam- 
ination of his inner functions under these circumstances 
will disclose many unusual muscular and glandular ac- - 
tivities, contractions, palpitations, inner secretions, 
flushes and pallors. All of these activities—holding the 
head, moving the eyes, recognizing the word, compre- 
hension, thinking and reacting inwardly—go on simul- 
taneously and they may be learned together as responses 
to printed words. Were we forced to utilize one set of 
explanations for learning to hold the head and move the 
eyes, another set for perception, another for thinking, and 
another for properly controlling emotional reactions we 
would fall far short of that comprehensiveness and sim- 
plicity of explanation for which science diligently seeks. 
The Stimuli Are Typically Complex.—Human reac- 
tions are complex and they are typically brought about 
by combinations of stimuli equally complex. The boy 
reading his book or the man walking along the street is 
not responding to one stimulus only although some one 
element of the situation may be predominant. Many 
other stimuli such as objects and events seen “out of the 
corner of the eye,” cries, honks and rumbles, odors, good 
or bad, heat and cold, are effective at the same time. 
Compare the effects of the ghost story on a boy sur- 
rounded by people at midday and a boy by himself at 
night! Often equally influential are stimuli which result 
from immediate or past activities in his own body, his 
present muscular and glandular activities, his present 
ideas, emotions, and purposes and such general conditions 
as those of fatigue, irritability, hunger, hurry, or melan- 
choly. To explain fully what the person does or to fore- 
tell what reactions will be made next it is necessary to 
take into account all of the stimuli, inner and outer. 
Because of its complexity the explanation of human 
ee

  38 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
behavior as it appears in daily life must be approached 
gradually. We must begin with a survey of the mech- 
anisms involved, illustrating some of the simple reactions 
and advancing gradually to the complex. We must de- 
scribe in some detail the form and functions of the 
receiving, the connecting and the reacting mechanisms 
The remainder of the chapter will be devoted to the first 
of these, the receiving mechanisms. 
The Physical Basis of the Stimulus-Response Unit.— 
First among the organs is the receiving apparatus, some- 
times called the sensory apparatus; most commonly the 
sense organ. The sense organ always contains one or 
more receptors which are highly sensitive to certain kinds 
of stimuli. The function of the receptor is to initiate a 
nerve impulse. Each receptor is in contact with the 
endings of a nerve. The impulse, resulting from the 
stimulation of the receptor, is conducted by the nerve to 
switching stations in the spinal cord or brain. After 
more or less switching about, the nerve impulse finally is 
conducted by other nerves to muscles or other mechan- 
isms where the reactions occur. The order of events 
then is: (1) the stimulus affects in the sense organ the 
receptors which (2) initiate a nerve impulse which 
(3) is conducted through the nervous system and (4) 
finally issues into the reacting mechanisms. The whole 
system is usually thought of as a unit, a reaction unit or 
a stimulus-response unit. A very simple reaction unit is 
shown in Figure 2. 
Form anp FuNcTIONS OF THE SENSE ORGANS. 
Sense Organs in General.—Sense organs vary greatly 
in complexity. The eye and ear are most elaborate; the 
organs for pressure and pain are the simplest. The differ-
-P-A-G-E-55
RECEIVING MECHANISM IN BEHAVIOR 39 
ences in complexity are due mainly to accessory struc- 
tures which are not sensitive to the stimulus. Differences 
in the receptors, the sensitive cells, themselves are too 
minute to appear to the unaided eye. The receptors are 
absolutely essential to the initiation of the nerve im- 
pulses; the accessory apparatus such as the external shell 
of the ear is usually of service but not always indispensa-

ble. The receptors are usually well protected; one of the 
functions of the accessory apparatus is the protection of 
the sensitive cells. 
The receptors although usually far too small to be 
visible to the naked eye are highly specialized. Each 
type is sensitive under ordinary conditions to only one 
kind of stimulus. The receptors in the eye are highly 
sensitive to light waves but are entirely insensitive to 
sound waves to which the sensory cells in the ear are 
   
-P-A-G-E-56
  40 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
attuned. Neither light nor sound waves arouse any other 
receptors under normal conditions. Certain intense 
stimuli such as an electric shock, a strong chemical or a 
sharp blow may initiate a nerve impulse in any sense 
organ, but this is an unusual event and such stimuli are 
termed inadequate stimuli, although abnormal would be 
a better term. The normal stimulus—or adequate stim- 
ulus, so-called—is the one to which the sense organ is 
specially adapted, the one which usually affects it. 
Sense Organs of Vision.—The normal stimuli for the 
eye are light waves; that is, wave-like movements of 
great rapidity conducted by a substance, ether, which is 
assumed to fill all space. Only light waves within certain 
limits—wave lengths between 760 and 390 millionths of 
a millimeter—are normal stimuli. 
The light waves entering the eye through the trans- 
parent front surface, the cornea, are admitted to the 
interior of the eye through the small opening at the 
center of the iris, that small dise of blue, brown or other 
color which is readily seen. The interior of the eye is 
dark like a photographic camera except for light admitted 
through the small hole—the “pupil of the eye’—in the 
iris. The iris corresponds to the diaphragm of the 
camera. When the light is strong the photographer 
makes the opening small; when the light is weak he 
makes the aperture large. In the eye the intensity of 
the light itself sets up reactions that result normally in 
an opening of proper size. Immediately behind the iris 
is the lens of the eye; and behind the lens is the large 
cavity filled with a transparent substance of the con- 
sistency of gelatin. Between the cornea and the lens is 
a small cavity filled with a gelatinous transparent sub- 
stance. The function of the lens in the eye like that of 
the lens in the camera is to bring the rays of light to a_

of the eye, the retina, which has the same general location 
as the plate or film in the camera, contains the sensitive 
receptors. In these sensory cells so tiny that nearly a

conducted by nerve fibres to the central nervous system. 
Only the little end organs in the retina are sensitive to 
light; all other structures such as cornea, iris and lens are 
accessory. The three pairs of muscles which move the

hollow tube leading into the skull serve much the same

function as the speaking tube of a recording phonograph 
or dictaphone; that is, it collects and directs the air 
waves inward until they strike a stiff membrane which 
is stretched across the bottom of the tube. Just as the 
membrane in the recorder of the dictaphone takes up the 
vibrations and transmits them to small metal attach- 
ments at the end of which is the recording needle, so the

into vibration the liquid in a chamber of the inner ear. 
In this deeply imbedded inner chamber are found the 
sensitive auditory nerve endings which are aroused by 
the pulsations of the liquid in which they are immersed. 
Sense Organs of Equilibrium.—Adjoining the organs 
of hearing are three other mechanisms, the semi-circular 
canals, the utricle, and the saccule, which are responsive 
not to sounds but to movements of the head. These 
organs consist of bony cavities filled with liquid into 
which tiny sensitive hair cells project as reeds may project 
_ into a stream of water. Slight movements of the body

disturb the liquids whose changes of position are the 
immediate stimuli of hair-like sense organs. These re- 
ceptors are involved in the acts of maintaining equi- 
librium when the body is moved in various ways as by an 
elevator, a ship or a street car or when it moves by itself 
as in walking, jumping, and stooping over. Any move- 
ment which involves the head, by its influence on these 
sense organs, activates nerve impulses that bring about

appropriate bodily adjustments. The leaning inward by 
the child on the merry-go-round is a reaction mainly 
occasioned by the effect of the movement on these sense 
organs of the head. When they are injured the main- 
tenance of appropriate bodily positions under such cir- 
cumstances is difficult or impossible. 
Sense Organs of Smell.—In the upper part of the 
nasal cavity somewhat removed from the pathway of the 
air currents or ordinary breathing is an area, about the 
size of a dime, which contains a large number of receptors 
that are sensitive to certain chemical substances in
-P-A-G-E-62
46 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
  gaseous form. To arouse the receptors of smell the chem- 
ical substances must give off a gas, that is, dissolve in the 
air; mere floating particles of matter such as dust are 
ineffective. As yet there is no reliable information con- 
cerning the number and kinds of gases which are adequate 
stimuli for the organs of smell though both are probably 
large. 
The receptors are microscopic rod-like cells lodged in 
the membrane with tiny hair-like fibres projecting above 
the surface. The elaborate accessory apparatus charac- 
teristic of the eye and ear are not found unless the nose 
is considered as such. Sniffing is a device for bringing 
the stimuli more effectively to bear on the receptors 
which are well protected from injury by their location. 
Sense Organs of Taste.—The receptors of the taste > 
sense are found mainly on the upper surface and along 
the edges of the tongue. They 
are often called “taste buds” 
since they resemble the ap- 
pearance of a plump rose bud

consequently tasteless. 
Sense Organs in the Skin.—So minute and numerous 
are the sense organs in the skin that no one has been able 
to make more than an approximate inventory of them. 
Estimates of the number vary from three to six million. 
There are probably more than two million pain receptors.

only to rather intense mechanical, chemical and thermal 
forces such as blows, severe pressure, pricks, stings, acids, 
extreme heat and cold. There are probably at least a 
half million sense organs of various shapes and sizes 
sensitive to touch or light pressure. Some of these, 
lying close to the surface, are sensitive to the slightest 
pressure of a hair or tuft of down; others, more deeply 
imbedded, are aroused only by more heavy pressure while 
many are found between these extremes. Some of the 
touch sense organs consist of a spray of fibrils or a coil 
such as those surrounding a hair under the skin surface; 
in others the fibrils are. bunched or coiled within other

tissue forming a bulb or “corpuscle”; in others the fibrils 
are surrounded with layers, somewhat as in an onion, 
forming a “capsule.” Another variety of receptors 
roughly similar to some of the organs of touch and num- 
bering at least a half million are aroused by radiations of 
heat of a degree lower than that of the skin. These are 
called cold receptors. The receptors for warmth which 
are less numerous, thirty thousand or more, are sensitive 
to temperature higher than that of the skin. All of these

accessory apparatus. The layers of tissue in the capsule- 
like organs, the gritty tissue in some of the bulb-like 
organs and the hair at the base of which sensory fibrils

serve to intensify the stimulus. 
Sense Organs Within the Body.—Receptors in un- 
known numbers running into millions without doubt are 
found in the inner linings of the body, the nasal mem- 
branes, the gullet, stomach and intestines, in the walls of 
the blood vesseis; in the fibres of muscles and ligaments 
and the surfaces of joints; in the tissues of the lungs, 
glands and other internal organs. Through these sense
-P-A-G-E-65
RECEIVING MECHANISM IN BEHAVIOR 49 
  organs bodily conditions and activities provide stimuli 
which like forces of external origin cause or condition our 
reactions. 
The receptors in the muscles, tendons and joint sur- 
faces are of significance since they afford the most obvious 
illustration of equipment by means of which specific 
activities of the body, themselves reactions, become the 
stimuli which in whole or part produce other reactions. 
When a muscle is thrown into action the movements and 
pressures stimulate the receptors that entwine about or 
are imbedded between the slender muscle fibers. The 
arousal of these receptors which are connected with the 
central nervous systems by nerves like other receptors 
typically leads to some other reaction. Each bodily 
process, such as breathing, moving the head, limbs or 
fingers, depends in whole or part upon nerve impulses 
that are aroused in this way. One part of an act such 
as lifting the arm or writing a name, itself a reaction, 
becomes a stimulus which leads to the next segment of 
the act, that to the next, and so on. Movements which 
require any appreciable amount of time involve a series 
of stimuli and responses of this type. 
The stimuli arising from the activity of the muscle 
itself, we have said, may often be a part and not the 
totality of the influences. Often the reaction is the result 
of several types of stimuli acting at once. Take walking, 
for example. To what is it a reaction? It is a response, 
or, rather, a series of responses, to many different stimuli 
acting at once; partly to visual stimuli obtained during 
careful or fleeting observations of the pathway, partly to 
pressure upon the soles of the feet, partly to stimuli upon 
the organs of equilibrium in the inner ear and partly to 
stimuli set up in the muscles by movements immediately 
preceding. The total movement of the leg in making one
-P-A-G-E-66
50 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY | 
  step consists of a series of muscular reactions linked to- 
gether as stimulus and response. Each minute segment 
of the swing of the leg is due to a group of simultaneous 
muscular acts which set off the next set of muscular 
responses. Similarly in playing a scale on the piano, the 
reactions are produced not wholly by seeing the keyboard 
and the fingers, by adjustments made to the sound of 
notes produced nor by the pressure of the keys on the 
finger tips, but partly—and in the case of the experienced 
player, mainly—by the stimuli occasioned by each little

segment of the act itself. Essentially all continuous mus- 
cular activity is produced, in part, by a stream of im- 
pulses which its own activity provides. A muscular act, 
then, is at-once both a reaction and a stimulus. 
Apart from muscular responses other internal activities 
and conditions directly affect receptors. That these re- 
ceptors are numerous and of several types is known, but 
how numerous the individual organs, how many the 
types, and just what specific stimuli affect them are not 
known. Some of the known receptors are similar in 
appearance to the pressure, warm, cold and pain sense 
organs in the skin, but others differ more or less and 
many await really clear descriptions. However few or 
many the types of receptors may be, the variety of inner

conditions and activities which affect them is great. By 
“conditions” are meant the states of affairs which under- 
lie fatigue, weariness, irritability, nervousness, nausea, 
ill-being, well-being, hunger, thirst, aches and the like. 
The exact causes of but few of such bodily conditions are 
known. The invasion of bacteria, disturbances in me- 
tabolism, poison, the secretions of the internal glands, 
deprivations, as of food or water, and muscular contrac- 
tions in the heart, arteries or intestines are among the 
causes: of stimulation. 
Inner conditions and activities such as these not only 
occasion specific inner responses of various types, as for 
example when irritation in the stomach cause vomiting, 
but they also affect more general behavior. Familiar 
events of daily life are evidence. A man, arising in the 
morning feeling fine and fit, greets his wife and children 
with affection and satisfaction, enjoys his breakfast, an- 
ticipates with zest the work of the day, disregards crowd- 
ing in the cars, smiles at the heap of letters on his desk. 
On another day, arising with a bit of indigestion or 
fatigue, he may be less enthusiastic about, even bored 
by, the same family, dissatisfied by equally good food, 
annoyed by the thought of the day’s work; angered by 
the crowding, discouraged by a similar batch of corre- 
spondence. The external situation gives only a part of 
the total stimuli; the inner conditions may sometimes be 
the more potent. Such combined action of inner and 
outer stimuli adds immeasurably to the difficulty of un- 
derstanding and predicting human behavior. 
Reactions To Many Stimvuui AcTING aT ONCE. 
Most of the reactions with which psychology is con- 
cerned are made not to a single and simple stimulus but a 
combination of different forces. The man strolling 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  52 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY . 
along the street or attending a concert, the child at play 
or in school, is subjected at once to varying stimuli 
through eye, ear, nose and skin, to stimuli from many 
internal conditions, from activities of muscles and glands, 
which, taken all together, make up a complex situation. 
The term situation is often used, instead of stimulus, to 
suggest the complexity of events; it means, strictly speak- 
ing, a complex group of stimuli. Stimulus and situation 
will be used interchangeably, however, throughout the 
book since most of the stimuli to which we respond are 
complex. 
What is true of muscular activities is true of glandular 
activity but in ways that differ in detail. The action of 
glands, especially certain internal glands, has pronounced 
effects on other activities, not so much by stimulating 
sense organs in the gland itself as by arousing others 
through its secretion. Circulated widely by the blood, 
the ‘secretions of the adrenal gland, for example, have a 
prompt effect upon the activities of the pupils of the 
eye, the heart, lungs, stomach and upon other glands, 
such as the salivary gland and the thyroid. Thus one of 
Gthe results of glandular activity, itself a response, is the 
production, in part or whole, of the stimuli which elicit 
other reactions. 
The reaction hypothesis, first stated in terms of the 
simplest conditions, needs no fundamental modification 
but merely elaboration to cover the responses to com- 
plex situations. It will be necessary, first, to show how 
the reactions are brought about by the combined effects 
of many stimuli acting at once. For this purpose, the 
way in which the nervous system conducts nerve im- 
pulses from many sources into one or more reacting 
mechanisms must be shown. This explanation will be 
offered in the next chapter. It will be necessary, later, to
-P-A-G-E-69
RECEIVING MECHANISM IN BEHAVIOR 53 
enlarge the group of stimulating factors to include con- 
scious activities, memories, ideas, emotions, purposes. 
When these processes are added to the activities of mus- 
cles and glands, and other internal conditions and ex- 
ternal forces as stimuli, we shall be ready to explain 
human behavior in complex form in accordance with the 
reaction hypothesis.

CHAPTER III 
THE CONNECTING MECHANISMS 
  The Main Features of the Nervous System.—A stimu- 
lus starts in the sense organ a nerve impulse which 
eventually occasions a response. Between the sense 
organs and the organs of response is a series of connect- 
ing links called neurones which constitute the nervous 
system. First in order are the sensory neurones, distin- 
guishable by the fact that they always originate in a 
sense organ and lead to the central nervous system which 
is encased in the backbone and skull. From every sense 
organ, from every tiny receptor in the skin, in the mus- 
cles, internal organs, the eye, ear, tongue, etc., run the 
delicate thread-like fibres of the sensory neurones to the 
central system. 
The central nervous system comprises the brain 
which occupies the large cavity in the skull; the brain 
stem and cerebellum at the base of the skull; and the 
spinal cord which fills a long slender hollow in the back- 
bone. \ Most of the sensory neurones from the receptors 
in the head enter the central system through the brain 
stem at the base of the skull. The sensory neurones 
from the remainder of the body enter the spinal cord 
at levels which correspond to the levels of the sense 
organs in the body; that is, those neurones from the 
lower limbs enter at the lowest portions of the spinal 
cord, those from the upper limbs at the upper levels of 
the cord, and those from the trunk at intermediate levels. 
; 55
-P-A-G-E-72
56 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
The central system is a switching station of tre- 
mendous complexity. It consists of millions of neu- 
rones which form intercon- 
nections between the sensory 
and the motor neurones. The 
motor neurones are those 
which, issuing from the brain 
stem or spinal cord, run to the 
various organs of response, 
such as the muscles of the 
head, arms, trunk, limbs, feet 
and internal organs. The neu- 
rones which carry the nerve 
impulses from the sensory to 
the motor neurones are called 
central neurones or intercon- 
necting neurones. 
There are millions of neu- 
rones of each of the three 
types—sensory, central, and

spects. They always include a cell body and a number 
of fibres. The cell body is a small but complex structure 
essential to the life and function of the neurone as a 
whole. The long, wire-like fibres which conduct the 
nerve impulses from one place to another are called 
axons. Thus, from a sense organ on the foot, an axon

times several feet long. 
runs up through the leg and hip until it reaches the 
spinal cord just below the waist line. Usually a num- 
ber of axons from adjacent sense organs are grouped to- 
gether to form a nerve as telephone wires are collected 
to make a cable. All of the central neurones contain 
axons which run from one part of the central system to 
another, sometimes for very short, sometimes for long, 
distances, The axons of the motor neurones are the 
long processes which connect the organs of response with 
the central system. 
The central neurones and the motor neurones contain 
a bushy group of relatively short fibrils called dendrites, 
whose function it is to pick up the nerve impulse from 
other neurones. The sensory neurone discharges its 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
58 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
  nerve impulse into the spinal cord by means of its axon, 
entering the central system. The dendrites of central 
neurones either come into contact or into close proximity 
with the discharging end of the sensory axon from which 
they receive the nerve impulse. The dendrites usually 
converge at the cell body out of which the axon leads 
to the dendrites of other neurones. In the case of the 
motor neurones, the dendrites lead to the cell body 
from which the axon conducts the nerve impulse to the 
organs of response. The dendrites, then, receive, 
whereas the axons carry on and discharge the impulses. 
The sensory neurones do not receive from other neurones 
and consequently have no dendrites. They consist of 
the end organs in the sensory apparatus, the long axon, 
and, of course, the cell body which is usually near the 
discharging end of the neurone. 
The Synapse.—We must give special attention to the 
junction between two neurones, the place where the axon 
endings of one neurone reach the dendrites of another—a 
place called the synapse. The axon endings and the 
dendrites do not actually unite or fuse; they simply 
come into contact or into more or less close proximity. 
Neurones are independent units, like trees growing with 
branches close together or intertwined. Lach tree is in- 
dependent, touching but not joined to one or more others. 
The association of neurones at the synapse is of this 
character. The synapse, then, is not an organ or thing 
but merely a place where axons and dendrites come into 
contact or are close together. 
The nerve impulse makes its way across the synapse 
when conditions are favorable, always from axon to 
dendrite, never in the opposite direction. Typically the 
endings of the axon make contacts with the dendrites of 
many different neurones; that is, there are many syn-

apses, but usually the nerve impulse follows but one or 
a few of the possible pathways. At some synapses great 
resistance is offered to the passage of the impulse; at 
others, relatively little. The impulse crosses only those 
synapses where the resistance is low. Thus the degrees of 
resistance offered at the synapses (or synaptic connec- 
tions) determines the course a particular nerve impulse 
will take and, in effect, what reactions will be made.

    What makes the resistance high at some synapses and 
low at others is not known. It may be the spatial 
proximity of axon endings and dendrites, the inner com- 
position of the fibrils, or some other condition. 
The nerve impulses, because of conditions which must 
at present be described rather vaguely as differences in 
resistance at the synapses, do not become scattered and 
diffused throughout the whole bodily equipment of re- 
acting mechanisms. On the contrary, they take particu- 
lar, limited courses and evoke responses in certain organs 
only. There are predetermined routes from particular 
sense organs; routes determined by conditions at the 
synaptic connections. Some of these routes are short;
-P-A-G-E-76
  
  60 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
some are roundabout; some are inherited just as bones 
and eye-color are inherited; some are acquired through 
experience as wrinkles and table manners are acquired. 
LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION OF CONNECTIONS. 
Routes and Reactions of the First Level—The sim- 
plest stimulus-connection-response unit (which may be 
designated by the symbols SR or S—R.) consists of 
a sensory neurone, a central connection, a motor neurone, 
and a muscle. Stimulation of the sensory neurone re- 
sults in a response by the muscle. Thus a slight prick 
of the skin on the finger or eyelid would cause a contrac- 
tion of a local muscle. There is always a slight interval 
- between stimulus and response, since some time—1/30 of 
a second at least and sometimes as much as 1/5—is re- 
quired for the nerve impulse to get under way, to com- 
plete the route to and from the central system, and 
finally to arouse the muscle. Such a simple and rela- 
tively prompt S— R unit is often called a reflex arc, the 
reaction a reflex act or a reaction of the first level. 
Usually the reaction is not so simple, but involves 
several muscles. Each sensory neurone makes connec- 
tions with many effectors by means of central neurones 
in the cord. Not all of these will be activated, but usu- 
ally a limited number, depending on the resistance en- 
countered at the synapses, will be activated. 
A great many reflexes or reactions of the first level 
may be observed in an infant very shortly after birth. A 
prick on the infant’s foot elicits a quick jerk of the leg. 
Uncomfortable stimuli such as tickles, pricks, heat, or 
cold applied to other parts of the body provoke prompt 
_ avoiding reactions. An object striking the cornea 
causes the wink reflex. Milk in the mouth causes a gush
-P-A-G-E-77
  THE CONNECTING MECHANISMS 61 
of saliva, a glandular reaction. Food on the back of the 
tongue causes a swallow; food in the stomach, gastric 
secretions and movements. A slight tickling of the nasal 
membrane causes a sneeze; an object on the palm of the 
hand, the grasping reflex. 
All of these reactions are relatively simple, involving 
only the most direct routes (reflex or first level routes) 
through the central system, and activating a relatively 
small number of reacting mechanisms. These reactions

are very prompt and certain, and for this reason they 
may be fairly safely predicted. They are uniformly 
found in normal infants, and since they can be modified 
or inhibited only with greatest difficulty, they persist 
usually throughout life. For these reasons, tests of the 
first level reactions have become an important feature of 
the diagnosis of disorders of the nervous system. 
Routes and Reactions of the Second Level.—In addi- 
tion to traversing one or more of the innumerable path- 
ways of the first level, a nerve impulse started, for ex- 
ample, by a pin prick on the foot, may make its way 
to routes of a higher level which are contained in various 
parts of the central system, located at the base of the 
skull, continuous with the spinal cord, and covered by the 
masses of the brain proper. Much of the brain stem 
which is subdivided into many parts, and certain neigh-
-P-A-G-E-78
    62 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
boring appendages including the cerebellum are devoted 
to connections of the second level. The portions of the 
brain included in this region we shall call the mid-brain 
and we shall speak of the responses as reactions of the 
second level or of the mid-brain level. 
We observed that a sharp stimulation of the toe causes 
a jerk of the foot, the simplest reaction. Perhaps also 
movements of the hips, trunk, or arms occur—reactions 
which probably involve only connections or routes of the 
first level. In some cases, especially if the stimulus is 
a strong one, the subject may turn the head, readjust 
his equilibrium, gasp or shout, and show internal changes 
such as an increased respiration and heart beat. These 
reactions involve more complicated connections—connec- 
tions of the second level—which are located in the mid- 
brain section. These routes are shown diagrammatically 
in Figure 16. 
Reactions of the second level are said by many authori- 
ties to be instinctive or unlearned. Although there is 
some disagreement upon this point, it is certain that 
many of them are unlearned because they may be 
obtained in the newly born infant. If you hold the 
infant’s nose, he first jerks slightly (first level) but later 
moves up his hands, pushes at the offending object, and 
later kicks, yells, squirms, and grows red with anger. 
Place the infant’s face in the pillow, he will attempt to 
draw the head back (first level probably) and shortly 
kick, move his arm, squirm, and perhaps succeed in turn- 
ing around. Such reactions as turning the head to 
sounds or moving arms up to things seen, or such com- 
plex inner reactions as appear during anger and fear, 
are usually second level reactions. 
Reactions of the second level, as contrasted with those 
of the first level, as a rule take place in a part of the
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE CONNECTING MECHANISMS 63 
body somewhat more distant from the point of stimula- 
tion, and they are somewhat more complex, somewhat 
less rigid, less invariable and more readily modified. 
These distinctions are not sharp, however, and only the 
expert in neuro-anatomy is able to distinguish the levels 
involved in many reactions.

providing joint reactions to several stimuli received at

complex bodily activities are responses made to many 
stimuli—from the organs of equilibrium in the skull, 
from the eyes, from the soles of the feet, muscular pres- 
sures in many parts of the body—which are pouring in 
at the same time. The mid-brain section provides in 
part for combination and redirection of these numerous
-P-A-G-E-80
    64 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
impulses into motor nerves that provide coordinated and 
effective adjustment. Instead of many relatively inde- 
pendent and unrelated reactions, harmonious joint re- 
sponses are thus secured.

Routes and Reactions of the Third or Brain Level.— 
The larger portion of the brain consists of the two cere- 
bral hemispheres, or the cerebra which we have hitherto 
spoken of as the brain proper, as contrasted with the mid- 
brain section which includes the brain stem and cere-

  THE CONNECTING MECHANISMS 65 
bellum. By means of a chain of neurones, a nerve im- 
pulse originating at any sense organ may finally reach 
the surface or cortex (literally the bark) of the brain, 
which consists of a tremendously complicated network 
of neurones. The portion first reached by the incoming 
impulses is called the sensory area. From the sensory 
areas connections are made with the motor area where 
exist almost limitless possibilities of connections with 
other central neurones, by means of which effectors in 
any part of the body may be reached. 
Reactions of the brain level may be of any degree of 
complexity, involving few or a great many effectors near 
to, or remote from, the point stimulated. We found the 
immediate withdrawal of the toe or foot, when it is 
pricked, to be a reaction of the first level; the more 
general bodily readjustment, in turning of the head, the 
ery of pain, changes in respiration, ete., to be second or 
mid-brain level reactions. To apply camphor to the in- 
jured spot or to examine it deliberately would involve 
neural connections in the cortex. All learned reactions, 
so far as we know, depend upon connections established 
in the brain or cortical level. It has been fairly well 
demonstrated, for example, that the ability to speak or 
write words, both of which reactions are clearly acquired, 
can be seriously impaired or destroyed by removal or 
injury of certain portions of the cortex of the brain. 
We have illustrated roughly the possible distribution 
of nerve impulses. Just what effectors will be aroused 
depends upon the conditions at the synapses. Certain 
synapses in the course of an impulse from any particular 
receptor, will be found to be “open,” that is, to offer little 
resistance as a result of one’s inherited organization. In 
this way, the unlearned or instinctive reactions, which 
involve mainly, and probably wholly, connections in the
-P-A-G-E-82
66 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
spinal cord and mid-brain, are accounted for. The rela- 
tive openness of other synapses, particularly of those in 
the brain, is determined by the experience and learning 
of the individual. In fact, all learning consists in the 
modification of synaptic connections by the passage of 
nerve impulses across them. The exact nature of the 
nerve impulse, now supposed to be an electro-chemical 
process, is not, known, nor is the character of the changes 
in the synapses brought about by the passage of impulses. 
A fundamental assumption of physiology, however, is 
that the transmission of nerve impulses does change the 
condition of the synapse in a way that makes subsequent 
passage more easy, certain and prompt. This change 
brought about by exercise is sometimes spoken of as low- 
ering the resistance, causing greater openness or permea- 
bility of the synapse, or in other ways. All of these ex- 
pressions imply the same general hypothesis. 
THE OPERATION oF THE Nervous System as A WHOLE. 
Diffusion of Nerve Impulses.—The nervous system is 
so organized that an impulse, initiated at any receptor, 
may make is way to many, perhaps to call, reactors. If 
all switches (synapses) were open, any stimulus might 
produce all the responses of which the body is capable. 
An approximation to such diffuse reaction can’ be shown 
in a simple experiment... If we prick the foot of a frog 
with a stiff hair or a pin, the usual response is a slight 
jerk of the leg. A second stimulation of the same spot 
will provoke a bigger response of the leg; a third stimu- 
lus may bring the other leg into action, and further 
stimuli will show a spreading of response until the whole 
organism, probably every muscle and gland, is involved. 
The diffusion of response is secured more readily when a
-P-A-G-E-83
THE CONNECTING MECHANISMS 67 
bit of strychnine, which lowers the resistance of syn- 
apses, is injected before the experiment is begun. Such 
diffusion of nerve impulse is, of course, not usually the 
case and never occurs except under extraordinary con-

ditions, but it proves the general statement that from 
each and every receptor, pathways may be made through 
the nervous system to each and every organ of response. 
The Convergence of Nerve Impulses.—The organiza- 
tion of the nervous system which has been sketched pro- 
vides not only for the possibility of the passage of a 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  68 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
nerve impulse from one receptor to almost all reactors, 
but for the convergence of impulses from many receptors 
upon one effector. That convergence, as well as diffu- 
sion, 1s provided for may be illustrated by an experi- 
ment upon a frog. A very gentle prod on the foot 
with a stiff hair may elicit no response, but when a slight 
sound is made simultaneously, the foot may jerk as it 
would for a more intense stimulation with the hair. If 
these two stimuli prove insufficient, a small flash of 
light added to the combination may cause the foot to 
jerk. The nerve impulses aroused in different parts of 
the body seem to have come together and combined their 
energy on the muscle in the foot. A light, a sound, and 
a prick on the foot are about as unrelated as any three 
stimuli could be, and if the impulses from these can be 
converged on the same effectors, it is probable that nerve 
impulses from any or all receptors may find their way 
to any particular effector. Indeed, this would follow as 
a necessary corollary of the fact of diffusion of impulses 
previously illustrated, i.e., the fact that from one receptor 
impulses may reach any given effector. 
The mechanism of convergence is illustrated in Figure 
18. Suppose muscle M to be in the foot. It may be 
aroused by a stimulus, such as a pin prick which affects 
sense organ A in the vicinity of the muscle. The reac- 
tion would be a reflex. Impulses received from B, the 
ear, or C, the eye, by means of connections in the mid- 
brain level may also discharge into M. In everyday 
experience this occurs in many of our bodily adjust- 
ments brought about by things seen or heard. When we 
are startled by sudden sounds, when we shift our equi- 
librium on observing an obstacle, or halt at a strong odor, 
the mid-brain level is involved. In most of our com- 
plex motor adjustments, connections in the cerebellum 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
THE CONNECTING MECHANISMS 69 
(illustrated by D) are also utilized. E represents a neu- 
rone originating in the motor cortex of the brain, and 
connected by motor neurones with the muscle M. Im- 
pulses from various parts of the brain (indicated by sev- 
eral neurones) may reach E and eventually discharge 
into the muscle M. Thus the response of M as part 
of any learned act, such as dancing, putting on a shoe, 
ete., is accounted for as well as what is usually called 
voluntary control—the arousal of M by an “act of will.” 
Voluntary action is acquired action, not to be sharply 
distinguished from learned reactions in general. A par- 
ticular muscle, then, may be activated by impulses which 
come from many sources directly through connections in 
the spinal level, from other sources through connections 
of the mid-brain level, and from still other sources 
through the cortical level. 
FacilitationSince each muscle has fairly close con- 
nections with a number of sense organs, the stimulation 
of two receptors will produce a more prompt and 
vigorous response than the stimulation of one; three 
will be more effective than two; and so on. The energy 
from one impulse adds something to the effectiveness of 
the energy of others activated at the same time when all 
have more or less “open” pathways to a common effector 
or group of effectors. This is the phenomenon of facili- 
tation. The neurologist is often able to select at different 
points on the body the several sensory endings from 
which impulses lead rather directly to a particular 
effector; that is, he knows where to apply stimulation to 
secure relatively pronounced facilitation. The possibili- 
ties of facilitation are shown in Figure 18 and everyday 
life affords other true, but less precise examples. If one 
is frightened while walking alone at night, one tends to 
speed up a little on slight stimuli; a crackle, the chirp
-P-A-G-E-86
  70 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
of a night bird, or the sudden perception of a dark object 
may stir us to flight. The sight of food on the table 
added to the odors and sounds from the kitchen, makes 
our hunger more acute. We shout at the horse, in addi- 
tion to other stimulation, to get the greatest action. 
Thus, when two or more stimuli, each having a similar 
influence on common effectors, are given at once, each 
facilitates the others with the result that the response is 
more certain, prompt, and vigorous. 
Inhibition.—Ordinarily a resting muscle is in a state 
of partial contraction or tonus, as it is called; and so far, 
we have considered only the influence of one or more 
stimuli in producing a greater contraction or a positive 
response. An equally important function of a stimulus 
is to arouse nerve impulses that depress the partial con- 
traction, or tonus, or suppress it altogether. The appli- 
cation of certain chemicals, such as salt, to the cut surface 
of the spinal cord, will cause a relaxation of certain mus- 
cles which are then aroused to activity only by very 
strong stimulation until the salt has been washed away. 
This is the phenomenon of inhibition. The usual jerk 
of the leg when an animal’s toe is pinched may be de- 
pressed or inhibited by stimulating, at the same time, 
an appropriate spot on the other leg. A familiar sample 
of inhibition is the suppression of a sneeze by pressure 
on the upper lip. Inhibition in the strict sense is more 
than mere blocking or prevention of a response; it in- 
volves a positive depression or reduction of the activity or 
tonus previously existing in the effector. There are dif- 
ferent degrees of inhibition as there are of contraction, 
and the former is quite as much a reaction to definite 
stimuli as the latter. 
The nature of the nerve mechanisms upon which in- 
hibition depends is not well known. In the case of the
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE CONNECTING MECHANISMS 71 
heart, at least, there are distinct sets of inhibitory neu- 
rones, but that all muscles and glands possess one set 
of neurones for stimulation and another for inhibition 
has not been demonstrated. Some authorities hold that 
the same neurones may conduct two kinds of impulses, 
one producing contraction, the other inhibition. How- 
ever this may be, it is recognized that practically all 
effectors may be inhibited as well as stimulated. Com- 
bination of facilitations and inhibitions adds greatly to 
the flexibility of bodily reaction; it provides for a wider 
variety of adjustments. 
Reciprocal Innervation.—Most bodily reactions in- 
volve both stimulation and inhibition so balanced as to 
yield the smoothest activity. For example, when. the 
forearm is raised from the elbow one set of muscles, the 
biceps, contracts, whereas another set, the triceps, whose 
contraction would straighten out the arm, is inhibited 
and so relaxed. If the biceps are stimulated artificially, 
by applying an electric current to their motor nerves, the 
triceps are innervated to inhibition. This phenomenon 
is called reciprocal innervation. Everywhere in the body 
muscles are arranged in antagonistic groups. Bending 
forward is antagonistic to bending backward; turning the 
head to the right to turning the head to the left; opening 
the hand to closing the hand; pulling to pushing; swal- 
lowing to spitting; and in the case of heart, lungs, stom- 
ach and glands, increased activity is antagonistic to de- 
creased activity. All complex movements, such as writ- 
ing, dancing, boxing, involve reciprocal innervations in 
great complexity. When thrown into action, each mus- 
cle by means of its sensory neurones innervates other 
muscles, some to increased activity, others to diminished 
activity or complete inhibition. The result is greater 
smoothness, coordination, and flexibility.
-P-A-G-E-88
72 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
    Integrative Action of the Nervous System.—The 
phenomenon of reciprocal innervation brings us close to 
one of the most important characteristics of neural action, 
namely, the tendency of the nervous system toward inte- 
grative action. By integrative action is meant the tend- 
ency of the nervous system to work as a unit rather than 
in innumerable separate parts. The various nerve cur- 
rents flowing through the system tend to be welded to- 
gether into one complex group which possesses a certain 
unity. Integrative action is unifying action. The result 
of the unification of nerve discharge is a tendency for 
the body to respond’as a whole, as a unit, to the pre- 
dominant stimulus acting upon it. The organism’s 
activity, in other words, tends to be integrated or 
organized into a whole of related parts. This fact may 
be clarified by illustrations. 
The examples of the “instinctive” behavior of infants 
given a few pages above, show reactions that are often 
complex, involving movements of the head, arms, fingers, 
and perhaps legs, trunk, mouth, vocal and internal or- 
gans which are really fairly well organized and constitute 
a general bodily response to the stimulus. When the 
child reaches to grasp an object, a certain coordination 
and integration of muscles in many parts of the body is 
found. <A very young-chick, when first presented with 
grains of wheat, pecks with fair accuracy, and in pecking 
from a standing position most of the body is engaged. 
Unless the many movements were beautifully coordi- 
nated, the chick would lose its balance, or fail to guide 
the beak to the right place or fail to open it at the 
right time, or start to straighten up before the wheat 
was reached. To carry out the act, all of the subordinate 
reactions must be highly integrated. Facilitations of 
same and inhibitions of other responses and many recip-
-P-A-G-E-89
  THE CONNECTING MECHANISMS 73 
rocal innervations are combined into a working whole. 
The typical reaction is a highly integrated one, at least 
in these and other instances of adjustments that are 
mainly instinctive or inherited. 
In acquired responses the same integrative action is 
also found. When a man catches a baseball, not only are 
many muscles of the arms and hands engaged, but also 
muscles of the eyes, neck, trunk and legs, changes in 
breathing and often other internal activities are found. 
To catch the ball, all of these must play properly their 
part in a unified whole adjustment. They must be inte- 
grated. Ofttimes the “muff” of the ball is due to some 
very small divergence of eye, or foot or finger. Well 
perfected reactions are highly unified. In learning to 
skate, dive, write, indeed, in acquiring all abilities, the 
nervous system progresses toward an integration of many 
constituent reactions. No characteristic of nervous ac- 
tion is more important than the tendency to unify the 
nerve currents to produce an effective total response to 
a stimulating situation. ee 
Integrative Action in “Attention.”—The integrative 
action of the nervous system explains also the character- 
istics of conscious reactions, characteristics usually dis- 
cussed under the term attention. Attention is not a 
power or faculty but a term used to cover certain facts, 
as follows: (1) the organism is usually adjusted as a 
whole to some one thing or event, that is, to some one 
situation. This adjustment includes proper fixation of 
the sense organs and of the body generally to receive 
most fully the effects of the stimulus. (2) The situation 
to which one is adjusted—toward which one takes the 
“attentive attitude’—becomes more highly conscious 
than anything else. ) This situation is the one to which 
some further response—approach, grasp, avoid, or observe
-P-A-G-E-90
74 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
further or neglect—if the situation does not possess the 
importance it promised—will be made. This situation 
which is at the “focus” of consciousness, is the one of 
supreme significance at the moment. That the organ- 
ism, as a whole, is oriented toward the “object of atten- 
tion” and that this object becomes conscious in the 
highest degree to the subordination of awareness of 
everything else, can be explained only by saying that the 
action of the system as a whole, including those mechan- 
isms which underlie consciousness, is integrative action. 
Due to properly coordinating facilitations here and inhi- 
bitions there, we become conscious not of a thousand and 
one different and unrelated things each in equal degree, 
or in degrees determined by the physical strength of the 
stimuli, but we become aware chiefly of some unified im- 
pression. This is the main fact usually implied by the 
word attention. 
The whole discussion of the action of the nervous sys- 
tem leads to the significance of integrative action. All 
other characteristics are subordinate to this tendency of 
the system to produce an effective, total response to the 
dominant situation. We shall encounter this fact re- 
peatedly in later chapters.

CHAPTER IV 
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 
Human behavior, according to the Reaction Hypoth- 
esis, is the result of the responses of three general classes 
of mechanisms, the muscles, glands and certain neurones 
in the brain. Thus far, in discussing reactions, one type 
of muscles, the striped muscle, has been used mainly for 
purposes of illustration. In the present chapter, a brief 
survey of other mechanisms of response will be presented 
together with certain considerations to show how the 
activities of all of them become most intelligible in terms 
of the Reaction Hypothesis. The effectors will be taken 
up in the following order: 
(1). Muscles, whose reactions produce movements, 
(a) Striped or skeletal muscles. - 
(b) Smooth muscles. 
(2) Glands, whose reactions produce chemical 
secretions. 
(a) Duct glands, such as the salivary gland.

Structure of Striped Muscles.—The striped or skeletal 
muscles, which constitute a considerable part of the body, 
vary tremendously in size from large ones in the shoulders 
17 
   
-P-A-G-E-94
  78 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
and legs to small ones attached to the eyes or vocal 
organs. Each muscle consists of a number of thread-like 
cells, the muscle fibres, which lie parallel to one another— 
hence the striped appearance. Each fibre is supplied with 
fibrils from the discharging end of a motor neurone. It is 
by this means that the nerve impulse, coming from the 
spinal cord, produces the contraction or relaxation (inhi- 
bition) of the muscle. 
  Fic. 19—Dz1acram or tHe Nevrat Circuit. The figure, from the sense 
organ to muscle 1, is the usual reaction are. When muscle 1 con- 
tracts, the sense organs within it are stimulated, resulting in the 
arousal of a nerve impulse which enters the cord and crossing the 
synapse, reaches muscle 2. Muscle 2 may arouse another reaction 
(connections not shown in diagram) and so on. 
The Neural Circuit.—Each muscle, as we observed in 
the preceding chapter, is equipped with receptors, as well 
as with the endings of motor neurones. The contraction 
or relaxation of a muscle stimulates the receptors thus 
sending to the cord by sensory neurones nerve impulses 
which may result in other reactions, in the same or in 
other muscles. The nerve connections involved, shown 
in Figure 19, constitute what is usually called a neural 
circuit. It gives in simplest form the basis of continuous 
activity, of activity leading to further activity as illus- 
trated under reciprocal innervation and at other points in 
the preceding chapter.
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE REACTING MECHANISMS 79 
Any posture of a part or whole of the body maintained 
for an appreciable time illustrates also the operation of 
the neural circuit, one activity leading to others. When 
one holds a pen, stands or sits in one position, keeps the 
eyes fixed on one point in space, many muscles are con- 
tinuously in contraction while others are actively in- 
hibited. (That these postures are really states of high

given. As the muscle contracts the curve rises; as it relaxes, it 
falls. The waves at the bottom are made by a tuning fork which 
vibrates 100 times per second. 
activity is indicated by the fact that many are very 
fatiguing.) The continuous contractions and inhibitions 
are produced by series of intermittent nerve impulses, 
twenty or more per second, whose rapidity is too great to 
permit a return to the state of tonus between stimuli, In 
old age, the rate of discharge may slow down until each 
response is perceptible, as in the shaking of the hand 
supporting a tea cup. 
Speed of Muscular Reactions.—The speed with which 
a muscular reaction may follow a stimulus varies greatly 
according to the muscle selected, to the receptors to . 
which the stimulus is applied, or to the conditions at the 
synapses in the neural pathway. When a stimulus such 
as an electric current is applied directly to the trunk of 
the motor nerve near its entrance to the muscle, there is
-P-A-G-E-96
  80 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
always a certain interval—about 0.01 of a second, more 
or less—before the muscular contraction begins. The 
typical muscular contraction requires some time to reach 
its maximum—0.04 of a second, more or less—after which 
it relaxes to normal in about equal time. When the 
stimulus is applied to a sense organ, rather than directly 
to the motor neurone, the interval between stimulus and 
response is greater. The wink reflex which is among the 
quickest requires about 0.06 of a second. Some time is 
required for the arousal of the sense organs and for the 
passage of the nerve impulse through the reflex are of 
neurones. Very simple motor responses, made deliber- 
ately, require longer time. For example, in making a 
series of taps at maximum speed with the finger, intervals 
of at least a tenth of a second separate the reactions. By 
utilizing a similar muscular response, that required to 
jerk the finger from a telegraph key, it has been possible, 
by means of delicate clocks, to measure the reaction time 
for different types of stimuli. The interval between the 
reaction and a touch stimulus varies from about 110 to 
160 thousandths of a second; the same reaction to a sound 
stimulus requires from .120 to .170 second; to cold .150 
to .200; to light .150 to .200; to warmth .180 to .230; to 
odors .150 to .200; to taste .300 to a full second; to pain 
.400 to a second. 
Factors Which Influence Reaction Time.—The differ- 
ences in time between some of the reflexes and others, 
and between reflexes in general and the voluntary or 
acquired reactions, as in the examples just mentioned, 
must be due in part to the differences in the pathways 
followed by the nerve impulse, since the same kind of 
stimulus—say a sharp touch—may be used in all. Dif- 
ferences in the pathway may be due to the directness of 
the connections, whether the first, second or third level is
-P-A-G-E-97
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 81 
involved, and to differences in the openness of the syn- 
apses encountered. In the experiments in which the same 
finger muscles were used and other conditions, so far as 
possible, were made identical, except the kind of sense 
organ stimulated, there appears evidence that different 
amounts of time are required for a stimulus to arouse 
nerve impulses in the receptors. The receptors for touch 
and sound are quick; those for taste and pain are slow. 
Other factors affect not only the time but particularly 
the force or vigor of the reaction. The strength of the 
stimulus is one such factor. A strong pin prick, electric 
shock or sound will cause a more pronounced and quicker 
reaction than a less intense stimulus of the same kind. 
The existing condition in the reaction mechanism and 
perhaps also in the connecting and receiving mechanisms, 
also affects the time and vigor of the reaction. Fatigue 
in the sense organ and muscle have considerable effect; 
fatigue in the connecting mechanisms possibly but not 
certainly, some effect. Decidedly potent is the condition 
usually termed the “readiness” or “set.” When the run- 
ner is “set” on his mark; the benighted boy, strained with 
fear, or the subject of an experiment “ready” to jerk his 
finger from the key, the response to the expected stimulus 
is usually more rapid and pronounced than when the per- 
son is unready. Readiness in these instances involves at 
least a partial activity, a high level of tonus, in the 
muscles. It may involve more, a condition of readiness 
of some sort in the connecting mechanisms, probably at 
the synapses. While its exact nature is not well under- 
stood, the condition of readiness—which we shall meet 
again in discussing other types of reaction—is an impor- 
tant factor in conditioning activity. 
Even small differences in the strength of the stimulus, 
in the condition of readiness, and in other conditions like 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
    82 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
fatigue appreciably influence reactions of the simplest 
character. Differences in these factors produce such con- 
siderable variations in response, that to secure a repre- 
sentative measure of the simplest reaction time of an 
individual, it becomes necessary not only to arrange the 
experiment with great care but also to secure many meas- 
ures from which the average is computed. 
Structure of Smooth Muscles.—The smooth muscles 
are found chiefly in the walls of the gullet, stomach, the 
small and large intestines, in the genital and urinary 
organs, the bronchi and diaphragm, in the walls of veins 
and arteries, attached 
to hairs, and in various 
glands. In_ structure 
the smooth muscles dif- 
fer considerably from 
the striped; instead of 
threads the elements 
are tapering spindles 
which unite to form a 
SY’stRIPED tissue, such as the wall 
of the stomach. SPINAL CORD

from those which sup- 
ply the striped muscles. We need not be concerned 
with the minute differences, and need only note that cer- 
tain motor neurones from the spinal cord lead to 
“ganglia” (7.e., groups of neural connections outside of 
|
-P-A-G-E-99
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 83 
the spinal cord) where they are connected by means of 
synapses with other neurones which run on to the smooth 
muscles. The neurones connecting the ganglia and the 
smooth muscles form part of what is called the autonomic 
nervous system. In Figure 21 is illustrated the extra 
autonomic link between the motor nerve and the muscle. 
Instead of one neurone running from the cord to the 
muscle there are two or more linked by synapses. They 
serve the same general purpose as the motor neurone, 
namely, to conduct the nerve impulse to the organs of 
response. 
Smooth Muscle Reactions.—The activity of the 
smooth muscles is like that of the striped muscles except 
that it is slower. Smooth muscles are sluggish in reach- 
ing the maximum of a contraction and slow in relaxing. 
They will maintain different degrees of tonus for very 
long periods of time. Most smooth muscles are very sus- 
- ceptible to the stimulating or inhibiting effect of certain 
chemicals, many varieties of which, developed in the 
body by glands, reach the “ganglia” as well as the muscle 
through the circulating blood. The paralysis of the 
smooth muscles controlling the iris of the eye by applying 
atropine to the surface or injecting it into the circulation 
is probably the most familiar example of such effects,

Tue GLANDS. 
Until recently, study of the glandular mechanisms has 
been pursued rather exclusively by those interested in 
digestion and assimilation of food, in storage of reserves 
such as fat, in growth and in the elimination of wastes. 
Recent research, although not as yet extensive, has shown 
that the glandular mechanisms play an important réle 
in general behavior. 
   
-P-A-G-E-100

ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Duct Glands.—There are two general types of glands, 84 
the duct glands and the ductless glands. The most fa- 
miliar duct glands are the tear glands, the sweat glands-of 
the skin, the salivary glands in the mouth, the digestive 
glands in the stomach, intestinal canals, liver and kidney. 
Each of these, by means of a duct or tube, pours its secre- 
tion on the surface of the body or into some body cavity.

muscles.

tend to provoke emotions, have pronounced effects on

The Ductless Glands in General.—The ductless glands 
are sometimes called the endocrine glands or the glands 
of internal secretion. They di cing general behavior the

t or prolonged muscular 
iffer from the duct glands 
in that they have no external outlet. They produce com- 
plex chemical compounds which are absorbed by the blood 
filtering through them and thus are carried throughout 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  THE REACTING MECHANISMS 85 
the body. The endocrine glands, like smooth muscles 
and duct glands, are innervated by means of neurones in 
the autonomic system. We can give but a brief and 
fragmentary description of a few of the internal glands 
and their influences on behavior. 
The Thyroid Gland.—The thyroid gland consists of 
two maroon colored masses connected by a strip of tissue 
on each side of the windpipe, close to the larynx. Every- 
one knows the position of this gland because of its great 
enlargement in the disease, goitre. The most important 
secretion of the thyroid is thyroxin, of which the most 
potent element is iodine. 
When the thyroid becomes over-active, or when thy- 
roxin is injected into the circulation or taken into the 
stomach, the effects, while slow in appearing, are very 
pronounced. The organism speeds up, is excitable and 
over-reacts. The pulse becomes rapid, the temperature 
goes above normal, and the skin is flushed and moist 
from perspiration. The individual is alert, irritable, un- 
_ able to relax or sleep perfectly. Emotions, as fear, anger 
or excitable joy, are easily aroused. If the over-supply of 
thyroxin is continued, the individual loses weight no 
matter how much he eats; certain vital chemical activities 
(metabolism) go on at such a pace that they exhaust the 
reserve stores of the body. 
All of these effects are symptoms of the disease, 
exophthalmic goitre, which is associated with hyper- 
thyroidism, that is, too much thyroid. Another disease, 
myxedema, is a chronic condition of hypothyroidism, 
that is, insufficient thyroid secretion. In this disorder, 
the symptoms are quite the reverse. All of the vital 
activities slow up; bodily movements are slow and 
clumsy; the temperament becomes sluggish, indifferent, 
insensitive, dull. 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  86 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
The Parathyroid Glands.—The parathyroids are four 
in number, about the size and shape of grains of wheat, 
located two on each side of the windpipe and imbedded 
in the thyroids. The secretion of these glands has not 
been isolated and its specific effect is not very well known. 
When they are removed in experiments upon animals, 
the subject becomes extraordinarily excitable. At the 
slightest sound or touch it will jump or even be thrown 
into convulsions. Certain human beings suffering from 
extreme depression, nervousness, restlessness, insomnia, 
and tremors, have been found to have defective or dis- 
eased parathyroids. At the present time it is believed 
that these glands have an important réle in the regula- 
tion of the assimilation of lime, which in addition to 
being an essential element of the bones, teeth, and blood, 
is required for the health of nerves. Removal, disease, or 
insufficiency of the parathyroids, by eliminating or de- 
creasing the intake of lime, and perhaps in other ways, 
produces marked disturbances of behavior. 
The Pituitary Gland—tThe pituitary gland, a small 
organ about the size of a pea, is situated in a well pro- 
tected position at the base of the brain. It is really a 
double organ giving two secretions, each bringing about 
a variety of effects. Over-activity of one of the pituitary 
secretions causes an abnormal growth of the skeleton. 
The giants which we see at the circus are probably victims 
of an over-active pituitary function. Insufficient secre- 
tion of one or both parts of the pituitary is said to be the 
cause of retardation of bodily growth in the case of cer- 
tain types of dwarfs. 
The pituitary secretions influence the tone of smooth 
muscles and the activity of various functions concerned 
in the transformation of materials into form available for 
bodily work. For example, the glycogen in the liver is
-P-A-G-E-103
  Nv 
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 87 
more rapidly converted into blood sugar—the material 
burned in muscular action—when the pituitary is active. 
The pituitary functions appear to be influential in deter- 
mining fatigability; inability to sustain effort being one 
of the .frequent complaints of those whose pituitary 
secretions are insufficient. 
The Adrenal Glands.—The adrenal glands, concerning 
which greater detail will be given in the chapter on the 
emotions, pours into the blood a fluid which profoundly 
affects nearly all of the other glands, both duct and duct- 
less, the action of the lungs, heart and intestines, of the 
skeletal muscles and possibly the nervous system itself. 
The action of these glands is one of the most conspicuous 
examples of one reaction influencing others. The effect 
on conscious activity is as marked as on muscles and 
other glands. 
The Glands in General.—Glandular activities, espe- 
cially those of the endocrines, are markedly influential in 
determining bodily responses and conscious life. Espe- 
cially important is their relation to the emotions, such as 
fear, anger, and joy; to temperamental and volitional 
traits such as excitability, vivacity, energy and ambitious- 
ness; and even on the mental processes of thinking and 
reasoning, they may exert a considerable influence. 
Exact knowledge of the functions of the glands is, un- 
fortunately, limited. They form a complex system. A 
change in the amount of the secretion of one affects many 
or all of the others. In what little is known it is apparent 
that the system of reciprocal innervations, involving both 
facilitation and inhibition, which was observed in the case 
of muscles, has a parallel among the glands. The secre- 
tions of the adrenal and thyroid have certain common 
functions as well as some different, almost antagonistic 
ones. The influence of adrenal secretion on the liver’s 
   
-P-A-G-E-104
    88 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
control of sugar is quite the reverse of the effect of secre- 
tions from the pancreas. The influence of secretions on 
muscular activities likewise may be either to increase or 
inhibit action. The thyroid secretion tends to increase the 
contractions of certain smooth muscles in the intestines 
whereas adrenal secretion tends to reduce or inhibit them. 
The action of the same gland, moreover, may be differ- 
ential; adrenal secretion inhibits movements of the 
stomach but increases the activity of the heart. 
Glandular reaction, then, presents a vivid illustration 
of activity leading to further activity. Although the 
mode of operation is different, the internal secretions 
bring about many reactions that are much like those pro- 
duced by direct stimulation of distant receptors. A pain- 
ful stimulation of almost any part of the body will result 
usually in an increase in heart and lung action. By 
means of neural connection between receptors and these 
reacting organs, an increase in adrenal secretion in the 
blood will produce an identical result. The secretions 
are particularly potent in prolonging altered activities 
inasmuch as they remain effective for considerable periods 
of time. The persistence of internal disturbances such 
as a rapid pulse and breathing following a shock or excit- 
ing experience is usually due to glandular secretions pro- 
duced by these events. By influencing bodily mechanisms 
and internal conditions, the glands affect conscious re- 
actions. Intimately related to excitability and calm, 
fatigue and vigor, elation and depression, anger and fear, 
impulsiveness and poise, the internal secretions play an 
important role in general behavior that psychology must 
not neglect.
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE REACTING MECHANISMS 89 
THe CEREBRAL CoRTEX AND Its FUNCTIONS 
A description of muscular and glandular activities does 
not exhaust the forms of behavior that constitute our 
everyday experience. Most of us would rate high, in 
terms of importance, our sensations, thoughts and feel- 
ings, that is, our conscious or mental experiences. There 
are three problems before us in seeking an understanding 
of mental activity: 
(1) Upon what bodily organs do our states of con- 
sciousness, sensations, images, memories, etc., depend. 
(2) What are the characteristics and varieties of men- 
tal states? 
(3) What are their functions—how do they influence 
behavior in general? 
In the present chapter, attention will be limited 
mainly to the first of these problems. 
The Physical Basis of Consciousness—We must 
admit at the outset that if we stand by scientific evi- 
dence, we cannot say with certainty that the activity of 
any organ produces a sensation or some other state of 
consciousness in the same manner that a muscle produces 
a movement or a gland produces a secretion. All that we 
can say is that the activity of certain organs seems to be 
a necessary condition of conscious experience. These 
organs are certain neurones located mainly or wholly in 
the cortex or outer layer of the brain. The assumption is 
that the nerve impulse, initiated at the sense organ, is 
relayed through the cord and the mid-brain by axons 
leading to the sensory area in the cortex of the brain. 
When these cortical neurones are thrown into action by 
the nerve impulse, we have the condition under which 
consciousness occurs. The cortex seems to be the imme-  
-P-A-G-E-106
90 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
  diate physical basis, or, if you wish, the organ of 
consciousness. 
Several lines of evidence favor the hypothesis that 
activity of the neurones in the cortex of the brain is the 
basis of conscious experience. The fact that a blow on 
the head or the stoppage of the flow of blood to the brain 
results in loss of consciousness is suggestive but not con- 
clusive evidence. More convincing proof has been secured 
by observation of the effects of partial loss or destruction 
of the cortex by injuries, operations or disease. The re- 
moval of certain areas of the cortex invariably results in 
the loss of certain kinds of consciousness. The removal 
of one area results in the loss of visual sensations—the 
individual is unable to see even when the eye and the 
sensory nerves are unimpaired. When another area is 
removed, the individual is unable to become aware of 
(conscious of) sounds although the ear and the sensory 
neurones are uninjured. The destruction of other areas 
abolishes sensations of pain, cold, hot, pressure, taste or 
smell. Widespread cortical removal results in losses of 
images, memories and other conscious experiences even 
though all other bodily organs—the sense organs, the cord 
and mid-brain, motor nerves, muscles and glands—are 
left intact. 
Science is unable to explain the relation between activ- 
ity of the cortex and consciousness. The immediate stim- 
ulus is. the nerve impulse. When it traverses certain 
cortical neurones, a sensation or some other conscious 
experience occurs, but just how or why is quite unknown. 
The circumstances, to use a rough analogy, are similar 
to those attending the production of light in an electric 
bulb. The electric current flows along the wire with no 
observable effect but, when it reaches the filament of the 
light bulb, there results a brilliant glare. No one knows,   
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  THE REACTING MECHANISMS ot 
as a matter of fact, what electricity is nor precisely why 
it should, when circulating through the filament, produce 
light, rather than a sound, an odor or some other result. 
Of course, a certain number of facts are known concern- 
ing the properties and effects of the electric current, which 
provides an approximation to the explanation of the oc- 
currence of light, but the explanation is not complete or 
ultimate. Less is known concerning the properties of 
nerve impulses and their effects on the neurones of the 
cortex, but the evidence nevertheless is such that we may 
assume that nerve impulses flowing through certain neu- 
rones are the necessary conditions of consciousness even 
if a complete or ultimate explanation of how or why is 
not available. 
LocaLizaTION oF Conscious Functions. 
To some extent, the particular areas of the brain whose 
neurones are most intimately concerned with definite 
conscious states are known, and study of them assists 
somewhat in classifying and understanding conscious 
behavior. 
Main Features of the Cortex.—The brain comprises 
the cerebral hemispheres, or the two cerebra (the singular 
term is cerebrum). The cerebra include the whole con- 
tent of the skull except the mid-brain with its appendages. 
The dividing line between the cerebra is a deep central 
cleft. In general size and appearance, the cerebra differ 
from man to man about as faces do; the main features 
can easily be made out but minor differences are always 
found. Figure 22 gives pictures of the surface. The 
neurologists have the brain surface very carefully divided 
up, like a map, into various areas, using many of the 
depressions as boundary lines. There are four large 
areas: the Frontal Lobe in the forehead, the Temporal

Lobe at each temple, the Occipital Lobe at the back and 
the Parietal Lobe on top; and two fissures, the Central 
Fissure which divides the front from the hind part, and 
the Fissure of Sylvius which begins at the temple and, 
running toward the rear, marks off the Temporal Lobe 
which lies below. 
The nerve impulses initiated in the sense organs in 
various parts of the body are relayed by central neurones 
until they arrive at what may be called the primary sen- 
sory areas in the cortex. The primary sensory areas 
connected with the important sense organs are fairly defi- 
nitely known. The impulses coming in from the eye are 
relayed to the portion of the cortex in the posterior part 
of the brain, 7.e., in the Occipital Lobe. This area may be 
called the primary visual area. No other part of the 
cortex receives nerve impulses directly from the visual 
receptors. The impulses from the ear are conducted by 
chains of neurones to the area of the cortex in the Tem- 
poral Lobe. This may be called the primary auditory 
area. The organs of taste are connected with the primary 
gustatory or taste area which is near the bottom of the 
cleft between the two cerebra. In 'the same region is the 
primary olfactory area which receives the impulses from 
the sense organs of smell. The sense organs of the skin 
and, to some extent, those of the muscles, ligaments and 
joints, send impulses which reach the cortex in a narrow 
area which runs from the top of the brain down the 
posterior side of the Central Fissure, ending at the 
Fissure of Sylvius. This strip may be called the primary 
' bodily-sense area. The primary cortical areas of other 
sense organs—such as those of the semi-circular canal 
and of many internal organs—are not known. 
There are two important facts which we should know 
concerning the several primary sensory areas: 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  94 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
(1)\ They contain the neurones whose activity is pri- 
marily and essentially correlated with the conscious 
response, the sensation. 
(2) They are profusely connected, by neurones both in 
and under the cortex, with many other parts of the brain. 
The Effects of Removal of Parts of the Cortex.—The 
evidence that the primary sensory area of the cortex is 
essential to sensation is twofold. Destruction of this area 
results in the loss of sensations, whereas injury of other 
areas, such as those immediately surrounding the primary 
centers, does not eliminate sensations. Destruction of 
the total primary visual area results in blindness; de- 
struction of part of the area results in partial blindness. 
Whenever this area is wholly or partly removed the 
result is a loss of visual sensations, in whole or part. 
When the primary visual area is uninjured but the area 
surrounding it is destroyed, the result is not blindness, 
but inability to recognize or comprehend the object which 
provides the visual stimulus. The subject is aware of 
(conscious of) a patch of color of a certain size but he 
cannot recognize it as an orange; he has no idea what the 
stimulating object is. One patient called a clothes-brush 
a pair of spectacles, an umbrella a plant with flowers, an 
apple a portrait of a lady. Complete destruction of the 
outlying parts would result also in “word blindness,” a 
condition in which the subject really sees (is conscious of) 
the word, but cannot interpret it. The symbol has no 
more meaning than a Chinese character to an American 
child. The patient might also be unable to recognize his 
friends, his house, and other objects, although seeing 
them. The visual stimulus arouses but one conscious 
response, the sensation. No other conscious reactions— 
percepts, images, memories, thoughts—occur. 
Removal of the cortex surrounding the primary audi-

tory area results in similar losses of conscious reactions. 
The subject is aware of sounds but unable to interpret or 
comprehend them, unable to tell whether they are sounds 
of the human voice, a piano or a passing automobile. 
Removal of small portions of the surrounding areas may 
result in inability to recognize tunes, or to understand 
spoken words, or in some other limited loss of compre-

hension without any defect of the primary capacity to 
hear sounds. 3 
Removal of the regions surrounding other primary 
sensory areas results in similar disturbances. The patient 
may be able to smell, taste, feel with the hand, but»no 
conscious reactions beyond the bare sensation are 
experienced. 
Sensations.—Sensations consequently must be a par- 
ticular kind of conscious reaction distinguishable from 
   
-P-A-G-E-112
    96 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
other mental activities which constitutes recognition or 
perception of objects, recollection of, or ideas about ob- 
jects. Sensations appear to be the first conscious reactions 
occasioned by external stimulation, since they have as 
their “seat” the areas first reached by the incoming nerve 
impulse. It is important to realize that they are reactions 
—to see, hear, taste, smell, or experience hot, cold, pres- 
sure or pain is to react to a stimulus. Sensations do not 
occur spontaneously without a cause. They are not 
things or processes within us which are brought into 
prominence by some type of self-activity or by some 
mysterious power of the “mind.” They are, like move- 
ments, the results of activity occasioned by definite 
stimuli. 
Other Conscious Reactions.—The sensation is the first 
conscious reaction, shortly followed by others. Each 
primary sensory area is profusely connected with other 
parts of the brain, thus making it possible for nerve im- 
pulses to be switched off in almost any particular direc- 
tion, to reach almost any other region of the cortex, or to 
be distributed at once along many different routes. It is 
probable that removal of the areas surrounding the 
primary sensory centers cuts off all or most of these con- 
nections with other parts of the brain, thus eliminating 
all reactions, conscious or otherwise, which are dependent 
on more remote brain areas. The cases just mentioned, 
in which removal of the region immediately surrounding 
the primary sensory area resulted in the elimination of 
recognition or perception of the stimulating object, do 
not necessarily prove that the area removed was the only 
oné involved in comprehension. The pathways which 
run through these areas are essential but not necessarily 
sufficient. To destroy them may-result merely in cutting 
some of the links in a continuous chain of neurones, all
-P-A-G-E-113
  THE REACTING MECHANISMS 97 
of which may be involved in a complex mental response. 
The localizations of the conscious activities that follow 
sensations might be determined by starting at some re- 
mote area, removing portion after portion, working in 
the direction of the primary sensory areas, determining 
after the removal of each part, what conscious reactions 
remained and what ones were abolished. This type of 
investigation, to be of value, would have to utilize human 
subjects, an enterprise which is obviously impossible. 
Such data as are available have been secured by studies 
of individuals who have lost portions oi the brain as the 
result of surgical operations, accident, or disease. Such 
cases have been too few in number and too varied in kind 
to yield very significant evidence, but they indicate, for 
such conscious reactions as percepts, recognitions, mem- 
ories, imaginations and ideas, dependence not upon 
sharply defined areas but upon tracts penetrating 
variously all parts of the brain. 
The Complexity of Brain Action During Thinking.— 
The probable complexity and extensity of brain activity 
may be illustrated by an adult’s reactions to the printed 
word apple. The stimulus, a group of light waves, strikes 
the retina of the eye, activating a nerve impulse which, 
on reaching the primary visual area, arouses certain neu- 
rones whose activity is somehow correlated with a sensa- 
tion. The individual then sees a series of little black 
marks on a white ground. The sensation is merely this 
awareness of black and white. But almost instantly, at 
an interval too brief to be appreciated, the subject com- 
prehends, or-is aware of, the meaning of the word.* He 
at once thinks of appleness, which means probably a 
fleeting consciousness of a round, colored, hard, odorous, 
edible object. Probably this really complex conscious- 
ness involves certain neurones running off toward the 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  98 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
olfactory area, others toward the gustatory area, others 
toward the skin or body sense area, and others to inter- 
mediate regions. The perception of the word would thus 
involve an extensive, complex pattern of neurones. Each 
percept involves neurones in many brain areas. Differ- 
ent percepts depend upon the same general areas, but 
the patterns of particular neurones concerned are as 
numerous as the percepts themselves. 
The act of perception is usually prompt. It is the 
almost instantaneous awareness of recognition of the 
stimulating object or event. In the present illustration, on 
seeing the word apple, one at once becomes aware of its 
significance, and the percept may be promptly followed 
by a series of thoughts or ideas. One may think of the 
kind of tree on which the fruit grows, of the appearance 
and number of such trees in an orchard familiar to child- 
hood, and then of related childhood events. The percept 
leads to an idea, which leads to another idea, and so on. 
The whole series may in one case constitute a reverie, 
in another, imagination, and in another, purposeful 
thinking. In any case, the continuity, despite the ra- 
pidity with which thoughts succeed each other, is the 
significant matter for which a neural basis should be 
suggested. 
Each thought in the series is paralleled by the activity 
of a complex pattern of cortical neurones which is not 
sharply localized, but widespread. The activity of one 
group of neurones, itself a reaction, leads to activity of 
another group, and so on. Thus each brain reaction 
becomes the stimulus which activates another brain re- 
action in somewhat the same manner as, in writing, the 
muscular acts made in one moment become the stimuli 
which occasion the acts of the next moment. And just 
as the series of acts in writing constitute a complex, rapid
-P-A-G-E-115
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 99 
and apparently smooth continuity, so a train of asso- 
‘ciated ideas seems more like a flowing stream than like a 
series of distinct reactions. Actually, however, the stream 
of thought corresponds to a series of neural reactions, 
each caused by another preceding reaction, one following 
another with great rapidity. 
One conscious reaction may lead to another associated 
conscious reaction, but this is not all. A conscious re- 
sponse may lead to muscular and glandular reactions as 
well. It is typical of the human individual to act after 
having perceived the situation or after having thought 
about the situation perceived. Conscious activity is the 
antecedent of much of human activity, a fact that will 
appear more clearly after a consideration of the motor 
area of the brain and its relation to the areas primarily 
involved in conscious life. 
Locauization or Motor Functions. 
The Frontal Lobe of the brain, which occupies the 
whole region in front of the Central Fissure and above 
the Fissure of Sylvius, is mainly motor in function in 
the sense that therein are the neurones most immediately 
concerned in directing nerve impulses downward through 
the mid-brain and spinal cord to issue into muscles and 
glands. In a long narrow strip of cortex immediately in 
front of the Central Fissure, running from the top down- 
ward to either temple, are contained the ends of the 
motor neurones which lead to the organs of response. 
This area, which we may call the motor area, is compa- 
rable in certain respects with the primary sensory areas. 
The latter are the regions to which all incoming neurones 
lead; the former is the area from which practically all 
outgoing neurones issue. Destruction of the primary 
sensory areas eliminates EuRSGPUSHess and all action 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE <1 ATE COLLEGE MURFREESBORO, TENNESSEF
-P-A-G-E-116
100 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
which follows it, whereas destruction of the motor area 
leaves consciousness intact but eliminates the motor re- 
sponse. Thus, destruction of the motor area would 
render the patient incapable of speaking a word which 
he can see and recognize, of running his typewriter, of 
handling properly a knife and fork, of catching a foot- 
ball, and of writing, even when he is capable of perceiving 
and thinking about these objects and the situations in 
which they are encountered. Complete destruction of 
the motor area, by cutting off the motor connections 
between the brain and the organs of response, would 
eliminate acquired acts and what is usually called volun- 
tary action, by which is meant responses whose imme- 
diate antecedent is conscious activity. 
Destruction of the motor area does not result in com- 
plete paralysis, since the reactions of the spinal level, the 
reflexes, and those of the mid-brain level, the more 
complex unlearned reactions, can still be made when 
proper stimuli are provided. The individual can vocal- 
ize, chew, swallow, walk, jerk away from pricks and 
burns, but he cannot speak English, sing an old song, 
handle machines and perform other learned or voluntary 
acts. 
Localization in the motor area, as in the primary sen- 
sory areas, is more exact than in the intermediate areas. 
The top portion of the brain area is connected with the 
muscles in the lower limbs, the bottom portion with 
muscles of the upper limbs and head and throughout, the 
brain areas and the connected body parts are in reverse 
order. Removal of parts of the motor area results in loss 
of voluntary activity in the corresponding parts of the 
body. 
The fact that removal of the motor area results in the 
loss of voluntary activity does not prove that all learned 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
a aa aaa 
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 101 
movements are located in this region, any more than the 
fact that removal of the primary sensory area, which 
eliminates all more elaborate consciousness, proves that 
all conscious reactions are located in the primary area. 
In both cases, what happens is that the connections with 
other parts of the brain are severed, so that activities 
depending on neighboring or remote brain regions are 
cut off. 
Connections of Motor and Sensory Areas.—The 
motor area occupies but a small part of the Frontal Lobe. 
All of the-portion in front is richly connected with the 
sensory areas and the other posterior portions of the 
cortex assumed to be involved in conscious life, as well 
as with the motor area. Impulses come in at the primary 
sensory areas, are distributed through the posterior lobes, 
then over to the Frontal Lobe, and finally, by way of the 
motor area, are discharged into the organs of response. 
During the transition, conscious states, sensations, per- 
cepts and ideas may arise and, in completing the circuit, 
the brain is engaged much as a whole. All parts are 
essential to successful activity, a fact which may be illus- 
trated by indicating the neural connections involved in 
human speech. 
Suppose we ask an individual to repeat after us the 
sentence “Where is my hat?” If the primary auditory 
area were destroyed, he could not repeat the sentence 
because he would be unable to hear it. If this area were 
intact, but the surrounding areas removed, he would hear 
the words, but they would be a meaningless jargon of 
sound and consequently it would be impossible to repeat 
the sentence. If all of the sensory and surrounding areas 
were unimpaired, the subject could hear and understand 
the spoken words and also think of them but still be un- 
able to say them when certain parts of the Frontal Lobe
-P-A-G-E-118
102 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
  in front of the final motor area were destroyed. In such 
cases the subject may know well enough what words he 
wants to say but he is unable to pronounce them. He is 
not wholly incapable of speech and can hear what he 
himself says, but it is impossible to get the right words 
out. The patient is not dumb but gets his words mixed 
up; he talks a jargon. The fore part of the Frontal Lobe 
is apparently concerned with the combination and co- 
érdination of movements which compose our complex 
learned or voluntary acts. Finally, suppose that the 
whole brain is intact except the final motor area. In this 
case the individual may hear the words and think of 
exactly what he wishes to say, and in addition to this, 
the impulses may be properly codrdinated in the fore part 
of the Frontal Lobe, but he is unable to speak voluntarily 
at all. The connections leading from the motor area to 
the vocal organs have been cut, with the result that all 
learned or voluntary action is abolished. The individual’s 
speech organs are not paralyzed, inasmuch as the mid- 
brain and spinal reactions may be made. The individual 
may cry out when frightened or injured, but the compli- 
cated acquired forms of speech are eliminated. 
Analogous difficulties in the execution of other types 
of complex reactions may be caused by brain defects. In 
a disorder called “motor apraxia,” the patient, because of 
destruction of the Frontal Lobe in front of the final motor 
area for the hands and arms, may recognize the object 
and think about it, but he cannot get the proper organ- 
ization of movements to handle it. When the final motor 
area itself is injured, he can recognize the object and 
intend the right movements of manipulation, but they do 
not occur. Disturbances earlier in the chain of events, 
in the region surrounding the primary sensory area, make 
recognition and hence proper movement impossible.
-P-A-G-E-119
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 103 
Destruction of the sensory area results in total inability 
to see the object. ; 
Thus there are four steps in the transition of nerve 
impulses through the brain: first, sensation, which means 
reaction of the primary sensory area; next, perception —. 
and thought, which mean activity of widely spread areas 
which compose the greater part of the posterior cortex; 
third, the organization of and-preparation for a complex 
motor response, which involves the larger portion of the 
Frontal Lobe; and finally, the collection-¢f the nerve 
impulses.in the final motor area, where they are dis- 
charged by way of the mid-brain and cord to the organs 
of response. Defects anywhere along the line will occa- 
sion disturbances or disability. 
There is often a very perceptible delay between percep- 
tion and final movement, a delay caused by a train of 
thought. For instance, if a subject is asked to “Give the 
best synonym for the word eloquent,” he may promptly 
perceive the words and grasp the meaning of the request, 
but he may need to think some time before deciding what 
motor reaction to make. Having finally decided what to 
respond, the movement pattern is organized and action 
results. Again, one may perceive that a gateway is 
closed and proceed to think things over for a time before 
deciding upon and taking a line of action. In these cases 
perception is followed by thinking, for a period long or 
short, out of which action may eventually issue. 
LocauizaATIon or OTHER FUNCTIONS AND PROCESSES. 
Tn all of these illustrations, both the intimate relation 
of conscious states with movement and the complexity of 
brain activity are apparent. In what appear to be rather 
simple matters, such as reading or repeating a few words, 
all parts of the brain are involved. Such functions, and   
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  104 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
similarly most of thousands of other acquired abilities, 
are not localized in any one small area. We know rather 
definitely where the nerve impulses come into and where 
they leave the cortex, but between entrance and exit, 
where conscious states arise and where the complex pat- 
terns of discharge are organized, the complexity of neu- 
rones concerned is baffling. 
If there is little likelihood of definite brain localiza- 
tions for percepts, images, memories, ideas, emotions and 
other complex conscious processes, there is still less possi- 
bility of precise localization of such complex traits as 
executive, selling, or teaching ability, the doctrines of the 
Phrenologists notwithstanding. Mental traits such as 
sagacity, attentiveness, and intuitiveness have no com- 
pact localization, nor have temperamental and character 
traits, such as vivacity, cheerfulness, trustworthiness, 
honesty, sensitivity, or tendencies to love babies, seek 
power, or enjoy music. Many parts of the brain are 
engaged in most of the single reactions of thought, skill, 
or sensibility. 
CoNCLUSIONS. 
To the muscles and glands, we may now add another 
group of reacting mechanisms, the cortical neurones 
whose activity is somehow responsible for consciousness. 
Conscious action is always reaction; it is the result of a 
stimulus, which, acting on a sense organ, activates a nerve 
impulse which reaches and activates the cortex or of a 
nerve impulse received from and resulting from the activ- 
ity of, other neurones in the cortex. Consciousness may 
thus be the reaction to a stimulus affecting external sense 
organs, such as eye or ear, internal sense organs, as in the 
stomach or arteries, or to stimuli received directly from 
neurones whose activity produces other conscious states.
-P-A-G-E-121
  
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 105 
Stated in different terms, external stimuli, inner condi- 
tions, and the activities of muscle, gland, or cortical neu- 
rones may occasion a conscious response. At the same 
time, conscious activity may lead to motor reactions, as 
when a person, thinking of a letter in his pocket, pulls it 
out and proceeds to a mail box; to glandular reactions, 
as when the thought of candy makes the mouth water or 
the thought of an insult stirs the adrenal to action; and 
to other conscious reactions as when the thought of a 
vexing problem leads to further thinking. Thus all of 
the cycles of behavior are complete. Diverse types of 
activities, conceived as reactions to stimuli, one activity 
influenced by and leading to others, are the fundamental 
characteristics of human behavior.

CHAPTER V 
NATIVE EQUIPMENT: STRUCTURES, CAPACI- 
TIES AND THE THEORY OF SPECIFIC 
INSTINCTS 
With some knowledge of the mechanisms upon which 
human behavior depends, and the general characteristics 
of muscular, glandular and conscious activity at hand, we 
are now in position to begin a survey of the behavior of 
man asawhole. To understand the conduct of the adult, 
we need to consider the origin and development of some 
of the capacities and abilities that are his. Especially it 
is important to secure as good a notion as possible con- 
cerning the degree to which the ability and character of 
the adult are the result of sheer growth of mherited-ca- 
pacities and to what extent they are due to the fortunes 
_of life and to systematic cultivation enforced or self- 
initiated. We should, then, begin our observations of 
human behavior at the earliest possible moment. 
If we had before us several newly-born infants for 
observation, it would soon be apparent that in the weight 
of the body, color of eyes, shape of the nose—in fact, in 
any anatomical feature we might single out—marked in- 
dividual differences occur. In the sensitivity of the eye, 
ear or other sense organs, in the speed and force of 
muscular reaction, in the conductivity and modifiability 
of the nervous system, in the efficiency of heart action, in 
the glandular activities of digestion, and in resistance to 
disease, variations are apparent even at birth. How are 
107  
-P-A-G-E-124
      108 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
we to account for these differences? Are they in any way 
acquired before birth, due to accidental factors, to differ- 
ences in nutrition or in maternal activity, or is there some 
other explanation of their existence? 
What is known about pre-natal influences makes it 
appear improbable that most of the anatomical and 
functional differences which appear at birth are acquired. 
While severe illness, emotional disturbances, malnutri- 
tion, alcoholism, and other serious misfortunes of the 
mother may affect the child through the mother’s im- 
poverished or poisoned blood, and while the child may be 
directly harmed by infectious disease or by injuries before 
birth, these facts seem to prove merely that there is 
required a pre-natal environment that will permit normal 
growth to go on. Given favorable conditions up to the 
time of birth, differences among infants will still appear; 
differences that are not acquired before birth but 
inherited. 
Life begins with the fertilization of the ovum, a micro- 
scopic but very complex cell. Contained in the cell are 
certain elements or “determiners” out of which the 
various bodily organs and functions develop. Certain 
determiners grow into certain sense organs, others be- 
come particular bones, others become teeth, and so on. 
Even for the most minute traits, the color of the eyes or 
the shape of the lobe of the ear, there exist determiners 
in the original cell. Except for the occasional pre-natal 
disturbance of the severe types mentioned, the differences 
among infants which appear at birth are native in the 
sense that they are the result of the unfolding, innate 
growth of determiners which existed in the germ cells 
from the beginning of life. 
At the time of birth, however, almost no trait, not even 
the color of the eyes, is fixed in its final form. Growth is
-P-A-G-E-125
    ATIVE EQUIPMENT 109 
still going on; the eyes rapidly become a deeper blue, the 
bones lengthen, the face takes on new expression. Are 
these changes which take place after birth, like pre-natal 
growth, largely an unfolding of innate traits, or are they 
now more largely determined by the influences, training 
or experiences provided by the much more variable and 
complex environment? As illustrations, we may consider 
the growth of the following human traits: 
1. Anatomical traits. 
2. The capacities or functions of bodily organs. 
3. Types of reactions, such as grasping, sneezing, cry- 
ing, fighting. 
THe GrowTH oF ANATOMICAL TRAITS. 
The growth of height might be taken as an illustration 
of the development of an anatomical trait. Beginning at 
approximately zero height an average boy has grown to 
about 20.5 inches at birth, to about 42 inches at the age 
of five, and from that time growth increases fairly uni- 
formly until the maximum height of about 68.5 inches is 
reached in his seventeenth year or thereabouts. Different 
individuals show various curves of growth, some less reg- 
ular than others, some maturing later than others, and 
reaching different maximal heights, and these variations 
as well as the rates and limits of growth are, in the main, 
determined by original nature by elements which existed 
in the germ cells. Of course, the child will not grow as 
he should without proper food, sleep and exercise, and 
his development may be disturbed by disease, poisons 
and other harmful influences. Y But given a reasonably 
good environmental opportunity, the child matures in 
accordance with his inherited predisposition. . 
Other anatomical traits such as the color or size of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-126
  110 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
eye, the profile of the face, or shape of the pelvis are, like 
height, determined mainly by original nature. The eye 
color assumes its final form very early, perhaps in the 
first year; the profile of the face changes slowly. The

of most anatomical traits. An afternoon of violent exer-

affecting height. Malnutrition and most forms of illness 
have less effect on height than on weight. But here 
again, given a normal] life, weight is largely an expression 
- of native constitution; that is,.if many children were 
given identical amounts and kinds of food, exercise, and 
sleep, and were free from disease, they would still attain 
different weights. 
  GROWTH oF CAPACITIES AND FUNCTIONS. 
Sensitivity of the Sense Organs.—The sensitivities of 
the sensory mechanisms are fairly well developed at birth, 
although growth is rapid for two or three years thereafter. 
By the age of three, the organs are very nearly as sensi- 
tive to stimuli as they will ever be, although it is probable 
that very gradual growth occurs until a maximum is 
reached in the late teens. Much the same curve of de- 
velopment is shown by the capacity to discriminate 
between stimuli; for example, between high and low 
notes, dark and light shades of gray, heavy and light 
pressure. The development of such sensory capacities 
seems to be determined largely by inner factors rather 
than by experience. Diligent exercise produces at any 
one stage some improvement, but the limit is soon 
reached. If one’s auditory acuity is poor, no amount of 
special practice will result in a high degree of acuity. 
People blind from birth, despite more extensive auditory 
experience, have, as a group, no greater sensitivity than 
other individuals. 
In making these statements, two sources of confusion 
should be avoided. The one is the case of defects of the 
accessory apparatus. of the sense organ, for example, in 
the lens or muscles of the eye, which may be remedied 
or corrected, thereby improving the function of the organ 
without actually changing the sensitivity of the receiving
-P-A-G-E-128
112 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
cells. The other is the fact that practice by the blind 
may result in very great ability to interpret sounds which 
the normal individual would disregard. The blind, by 
attending to the echoes.from their footsteps, may detect 
the presence of obstacles or doorways in a room, but this 
sort of learning does not imply an increase in sensitivity 
of the sense organ. 
Functions of the Reacting Mechanisms.—The func- 
tions of the reacting mechanisms, like those of the receiv- 
ing mechanisms, show typical rates and limits of growth. 
Concerning the development of the glands, very little is 
known. Most of them seem: to be functioning actively 
from birth until death; for example, the thyroid, the 
pituitary, the adrenals, the pancreas, the salivary, sweat 
and lachrymal glands. The pineal and thymus appear to 
function actively in childhood and to die with it. The 
sex glands show various stages of growth with the appear- 
ance of new functions at pubescence. Extraordinary con- 
ditions, disease, shock, overwork, may disturb the func- 
tioning and growth of any of the glands but normally 
the development is determined from within. 
The speed of muscular reaction, as determined by the 
number of taps made in a given time or by the time in 
thousandths of a second, required to jerk the hand from — 
a telegraph key at a signal; the precision and steadiness 
with which a subject can move a short pointer down a 
continuously narrowing groove and the strength of mus- 
cular reaction represent fairly elementary muscular 
capacities upon which, among other things, the acquisi- 
tion of skill depends. As children become older, their 
efficiency in all of these functions increases. That innate 
growth is responsible in a goodly measure for this de- 
. velopment can be shown by an experiment. If we take a 
group of adults or children of the same age and give them 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  NATIVE EQUIPMENT 113 
five minutes’ daily practice in tapping, they will have 
reached their limit of improvement in from 12 to 22 
days. But their maximal abilities are very different. 
These differences, since practice up to the limit of the 
individuals’ capacities does not obliterate them, must be 
innate. Young children who have reached their practice 
level may, after an interval of time during which growth 
occurs, again improve somewhat by practice. The degree 
of absolute achievement at any stage may be increased 
by special practice or experience but only within certain 
limits which are determined by native endowment. When 
practice and other circumstances of life are equalized, 
differences between individuals will still exist and these 
differences are native. 
Capacities of the Nervous System.—Modifiability and 
retentiveness of the neurones, upon which learning de- 
pends, can be measured at least roughly by tests of 
general intelligence or general mental ability or of the 
rate and permanence with which various types of in- 
formation and skill may be acquired at different ages. 
As we shall see later, the capacity to learn and retain 
develops gradually from birth to maturity in a manner 
which resembles strikingly the course of growth for 
height. While we are still in doubt about the earliest and 
latest stages and other characteristics of the growth of 
these capacities, the essential fact that they do grow in 
a manner determined by native endowment is well estab- 
lished. The capacity to learn and retain, to profit by 
practice and experience, is native. Like other innate 
traits, a favorable environment is required to permit 
normal development which may be retarded or inhibited 
by extraordinary misfortunes, but so far as we know no 
special type of exercise or training will greatly increase 
these capacities. To be well fed, healthy, and normally 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
114 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
active, physically and mentally, is sufficient to enable 
these powers to attain their full fruition. 
  Tue Instincr THEORY. 
We have spoken of the development of certain bodily 
organs and traits and of certain important capacities and 
functions. We find in addition to these traits and capaci- 
ties, and depending upon them, a wide variety of activi- 
ties,—crying, breathing, grasping, creeping, walking, 
fighting,—going on immediately after birth or appearing 
at a later time. The question arises as to whether all of 
these activities are acquired as the result of experience 
and practice or whether some or all of them are, like the 
growth of bones or the appearance of teeth, mainly the 
result of inner development depending on “determiners” 
existing in the germ cells at the genesis of life. (If forms 
of behavior—that is, reactions to stimuli—do result from 
innate development alone such activities are said to be 
instinctive, or to use nearly equivalent terms, innate, 
native, inherited, or unlearned. 
Taken in the simplest form, all activity is instinctive. 
The mere capacity of the muscle to contract, the gland 
to secrete, the cortical neurones to activate consciousness 
is unquestionably native. Such activities are the func- 
tional correlative of structure. Always with the posses- 
sion of a given organ goes at least the capacity for its use 
in some simple form. If this were not true the organism 
would forever remain inactive. The problem presented 
by the instinct theory, however, is whether codrdinated 
reactions to definite situations are native; whether in the 
nervous system native connections are provided which 
result in some particular response, relatively simple or 
complex, to specific situations. It is the question whether 
the child creeps, walks, runs, climbs, adjusts the sense
-P-A-G-E-131
  NATIVE EQUIPMENT 115 
organs, cries in fear during a thunderstorm, dodges mis- 
siles and fights in a characteristic way because his nervous 
system by inner development attains the connections 
involved in these acts or whether such responses are 
acquired during experience. The hypothesis that many 
such forms of response are native is called the instinct 
theory. 
THEORETICAL Basis OF THE INSTINCT THEORY. 
The theoretical arguments in favor of the instinct 
theory are two; one resting on an analogy between the 
growth of bodily organs and capacities and the growth of 
behavior, the other on an analogy between animal and 
human behavior. 
Analogy with Growth of Organs and Fuses 
The first theoretical consideration is based on the assump- 
tion that the growth of neural connections, upon which 
instinctive behavior must depend, would most probably 
have the same general character as the growth of bones, 
skin, sensory and other organs. If the eye-color reaches 
“its final form very shortly after birth, if the sensitivity 
of the sense organs reaches a limit late in the teens as 
the result of inner development, then, it is argued, it is 
reasonable to admit the possibility that types of behavior 
such as forms of manipulation and vocalization, abilities 
to manage the body as in locomotion, etc., may develop 
gradually and mature at some time after birth mainly as 
the result of innate changes in the nervous system. Again, 
it is argued that as the growth of the permanent teeth or 
of hair on the boy’s lip begins, or at least develops in a 
spurt, considerably after birth so the appearance of cer- 
tain forms of behavior such as walking, fighting or court- 
ing may be the delayed flowering of innate neural growth.
-P-A-G-E-132
  116 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Birth, it is pointed out, is not a period of metamorphosis 
but merely an incident in development; growth and un- 
folding continue thereafter quite as before. Specific 
innate growth of neural connections is no less possible, 
theoretically, than specific development of muscles, teeth, 
bones or glands. 
Analogy with Animal Behavior.—In addition to the 
argument based on analogy with the growth and delayed. | 
appearance of bodily structure, the theory seeks support 
in the conviction that instincts exist in animals and are 
therefore probably found in man. It is first assumed 
that many of the activities such as web-spinning, nest 
building, flying, mating, and stalking prey, of insects, fish, 
birds and beasts are instinctive. If this assumption is 
correct, then it is reasonable to suppose, in the light of 
the theory of evolution, that analogous activities in man 
re also instinctive. Just as there is a continuity of ° 
organs and structures, of eye, bones and brain, there may 
be expected a continuity of behavior... Indeed, many 
believe that man, the most complex of living organisms, 
should possess an instinctive equipment more extensive 
and complex than that of any other organism. 
These two arguments, the one based on analogy with 
the growth of human physical structures and capacities, 
and the other on an analogy with animal behavior, are at 
best suggestive. Conclusive evidence concerning the in- 
nateness of patterns of behavior must be sought in other 
ways. How may an hereditary reaction be distinguished 
from an acquired one? 
~ Means or DistrncuisHinc Native rrom AcQuIRED 
REACTIONS. 
The chief means by which it is sought to distinguish 
instinctive from learned activities are three: 
1
-P-A-G-E-133
NATIVE EQUIPMENT ve he 
1. The test. of existence at the time of birth or soon 
after. 
2. The test of universality of appearance. 
38. The test of appearance without opportunity to 
learn. 
Reactions Appearing at Birth—The newly born 
infant of the human and most other species is capable of 
making a considerable number of reactions at the time of, 
or shortly after, birth. Many of these activities such as 
the digestive and circulatory, some of the defensive and 
avoiding responses, the inner changes during anger or 
fright are exceedingly complicated and remarkably co- 
6rdinated to serve some particular biological purpose; 
they are so complex as to exclude all possibility of learn- 
ing under the conditions preceding their appearance. 
There is no way to account for them except to assume 
that they are the results of inner growth. The demon- 
stration of the appearance of a complex act at birth or 
soon after is quite conclusive proof that it is instinctive. 
Many of the reactions of man, at least those in which 
psychology is interested, are. not obviously present at 
birth. They appear at various times until well in the 
teens. Whether any one of these activities is native or 
acquired must be ascertained, consequently, by other 
means. : 
The Test of Universality.—A preliminary test which 
has been extensively utilized in the study of the human 
species is based on the assumption that those traits which 
are universally found among human beings, present and 
past, civilized and primitive, whose surroundings, occu- 
pations, ideals and customs differ greatly, are likely to be 
instinctive rather than acquired. Especially if a trait 
such as walking, fear of the dark, interest in gang activi-
-P-A-G-E-134
118 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
  ties or the disposition to sing appears at about the same 
age and in about the same way under radically different 
conditions of life it would suggest that something in- 
herent in human nature might most probably account for 
the facts; at least it would seem that such activities are 
more likely to be native than others which are not so 
universal. This basis of selection is known as the test of 
universality. It is not a conclusive test; merely a pre- 
liminary one. Not all universal traits need be instinctive. 
All peoples may eat with some form of utensil yet the 
child must be taught, not without difficulty, to use a 
spoon. Not all instinctive traits need appear universally. 
If hunting, killing animals or fighting were instinctive, it 
might not appear universally because it is tabooed by 
parents and society. Universality may be deceptive be- 
cause some traits are everywhere taught and encouraged 
and others—like stealing—are in most places discouraged. 
The test of universality, then, must be employed with 
greatest care. : 
The Test of Appearance Without Opportunity to 
Learn.—In the case of a reaction which first appears 
some time after birth, the only conclusive proof that it 
is instinctive is the demonstration that it appears without 
education, experience or practice of any sort. Two meth- 
ods of securing the information needed to satisfy this test 
have been utilized thus far. The first is the method of 
continuous observation, the other the experimental de- 
vice of controlling the experiences and practice oppor- 
tunities of the individual from the time of birth. These 
two methods may be combined in various ways. 
Method of Continuous Observation.—To yield con- 
clusive evidence, direct observation of an animal or 
human infant from the time of birth must be complete; 
not only must all of the individual’s behavior be recorded
-P-A-G-E-135
  NATIVE EQUIPMENT 119 
with accuracy and detail but the surroundings, activities 
observed by the subjects, words spoken to him, rewards 
and punishments given—every relevant external factor— 
must be noted. From such data, both reliable and com- 
plete, it would be possible to discover whether a par- 
ticular reaction appeared without an opportunity to 
learn. If it did so appear, the activity would be accepted 
as instinctive. 
The number of observations reported by competent 
persons on the human infant from birth until any con- 
siderable period later is small and none of these has 
approached closely the rigid control demanded for un- 
equivocal interpretation. A number of studies by edu- 
cated parents of their own infants and children and a few 
studies, by experts, of infants in maternity wards and 
orphanages which alone are available have yielded sug- 
gestive but by no means conclusive evidence. The ob- 
servations of animals have been more extensive and 
satisfactory. 
Method of Controlling the Experience and Practice 
of an Infant.—Experiments of this type have usually 
taken the form of withholding a stimulus or the oppor- 
tunity to learn until a designated time whereupon the 
individual’s first reactions may be observed. To ascer- 
tain, for example, whether children instinctively fear 
large beasts, the method would consist in guarding them 
from any experience with such animals until, at the end 
of the first week for one, the second week for another, 
and so on, the animal is presented. If the fear appeared, 
even long after birth without experience with, or knowl- 
edge of, beasts the likelihood is that the reaction is in- 
stinctive. In a similar way, the opportunity to attempt 
to walk or swim might be withheld until various delayed 
periods. If, at a certain time, the child is able to swim or 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  120 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
walk with little or no practice, the implication would be 
that such an act was mainly the result of inner maturity. 
Adequate tests of these sorts would afford very conclu- 
sive evidence. But for obvious reasons, few such experi- 
ments have been conducted upon human subjects. A 
number of tests have been applied to young animals. 
The evidence upon which the instinct theory now rests 
consists of the results of a limited number of observa- 
tions of human infants and animals soon after birth; a 
few fairly continuous, but by no means complete, studies 
of infants during the first few years of life; a mass of 
less continuous and less thoroughly controlled observa- 
tions of children and adults at work and play in various 
places and at various times to the results of which the 
criterion of universality may be applied; and a limited 
number of experimental studies, almost exclusively upon 
animals, by the method of controlled opportunities. In 
attempting to make an inventory of the instinctive equip- 
ment of man, we shall be compelled to draw upon all 
available evidence which, it must be admitted, is in many 
instances not adequate enough to justify a positive 
opinion. ; 
Eviwence or Instincts In ANIMALS. 
One of the arguments in favor of the existence of 
numerous instincts in man is based upon the assumption 
that animals possess many hereditary patterns of re- 
sponse both simple and complex. Before such an argu- 
ment could be given weight, it is necessary to demon- 
strate the existence of such instincts in the animals. 
Evidence may be sought both in the results of observa- 
tions and controlled experiments. We shall offer the 
results of a few investigations.
-P-A-G-E-137
NATIVE EQUIPMENT 121 
Study of the Flying of Birds——Some newly hatched 
birds were taken (by Spalding) and each locked up in a 
box so small that it was unable even to stretch its wings 
and isolated so that it could not observe’ other birds in 
flight. Thus these birds were deprived of all opportunity 
to learn until others, hatched at the same time, had be- 
come competent performers. Then the caged birds were 
released, They were able to fly at once, almost but not 
quite as well as the birds which had not been imprisoned. 
Their control was not quite as good; alighting for a time 
was clumsy, but a large part of the ability to fly had 
developed without specific practice. 
Since the acts of flying included taking off, controlling 
the wings, legs, head and neck, keeping right side up, 
avoiding obstacles, curving down and up and complex 
variations of the movements of all of these organs in 
alighting, it is fair to describe such a performance as a 
complex codrdinated series of responses. _ Since they are 
apparently native, the theory of instincts is well sub- 
stantiated in at least one instance among animals. Other 
examples have also been yielded, by experiment. 
- Study of Kittens’ First Attempts to Catch Mice.—A 
study (by Yerkes) of the ability of kittens to catch mice 
took the form of providing opportunity for the exercise 
of the reaction before the usual time of appearance. At 
short intervals from birth to the end of the fourth month 
of their lives, kittens were placed one at a time in the 
presence of a mouse. At first they paid little or no atten- 
tion but at a certain time, usually about the eighth week 
but earlier or later in some cases, the kitten quickly 
roused itself and launched an attack upon the mouse, an 
attack which according to the observer exhibited almost 
the complete repertoire of movements used by the adult 
cat in catching and killing mice. The mouse was pursued,
-P-A-G-E-138
122 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
  caught, worried, killed and partially eaten. Here, then, 
is a sample of rather complex behavior which appears 
some time after the animal has been physically capable of 
action. Apparently before the mouse became a stimulus 
to the kitten’s attack-catch-kill interests and abilities, a 
certain neural growth had to take place. Such growth 
need not, of course, be as rapid and abrupt as the appear- 
ance of the reaction. Like the appearance of a blossom 
following steady growth of the plant, or the sudden 
boiling of water after a gradual heating, the reaction may 
be merely the flowering or culminating stage of a long 
period of growth. 
The mouse-catching reactions and the impulses which 
go with it are samples of behavior which appear to be 
inherited in rather well organized form. Probably more 
exact observations would show the initial attacks to lack 
the precision and perfection which would result from 
further experience but it nevertheless appeared that a 
fairly effective method of response is possible with no 
practice at all and therefore must be considered native. 
Study of Pecking by Chicks.—A better measure of the . 
precision with which the first trials of a supposedly in- 
stinctive act are carried out is provided by an experiment 
(by Breed and Shepard) upon the ability of chicks to 
peck, seize and swallow grain. A number of chicks 
hatched at the same time were divided into three groups, 
A,BandC. The chicks in group A were first afforded an 
opportunity to peck grain on the second day after hatch- 
ing. On this and on each succeeding day, these chicks 
were allowed to peck just fifty times. The chicks in 
group B were not allowed to peck grain until the fourth’ 
day after hatching; group C began on the sixth day. 
The average number of times the grains were seized and 
swallowed each day by the three groups are shown in
-P-A-G-E-139
NATIVE EQUIPMENT 123 
Figure 26. In all cases the performances were imperfect 
the first day but a high level of efficiency was soon 
achieved. On the whole, the increase in ability was more 
rapid in the groups which began later. After the seventh 
«day, all groups, despite inequalities in previous experi- 
ence, were about equally good.

Cuicks Given Terr First Practice on THE Seconp, FourTH AND 
Srxtu Day} Respecrivery, Arrer Harcuine. Fifty trials were given 
each day after the first practice. (Modified after Breed and 
Shepard.) 
This experiment, despite the fact that practice brings 
about rapid improvement, illustrates the presence of an 
instinctive basis for the act. For one thing, pecking 
begins very shortly after hatching when the chick has 
had but a few hours of worldly experience and before 
bodily strength and stability is far advanced. The most 
significant thing is the appearance of the impulse to peck 
without guidance or example to imitate. The chick does 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  124 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
not just disregard, nor merely stare at, nor push with his 
feet nor do a number of other conceivable things with 
the grain but it proceeds at once to peck. At the begin- 
ning pecking it by no means totally aimless. To score 
a success the chick must hit the grain accurately, close . 
his bill on it, lift it up, get it into his mouth and swallow. 
There are many possibilities of a miss between the ground 
and the crop; the first efforts are not very poor and the 
amount of practice leading to a high degree of perfection 
is very small. After a single practice period, the chicks 
which began on the sixth day improved but slightly from 
further experience. 
This study illustrates, moreover, characteristics which 
may be found in many activities fundamentally native, 
namely, the relative imperfection of first attempts and 
the supplementary effects of practice in polishing off, in 
perfecting the act. Imperfection in the first attempts is 
by no means inconsistent with nativeness; on the con- 
trary, it is quite to be expected, partly because maturity 
of neural connections is not achieved in an instant but 
requires time for growth even in those traits which appear 
early and partly because the inheritance of a motor re- 
sponse exactly fitted to the first situation encountered is 
not to be expected. What develops innately is in such 
cases a neural mechanism roughly fitted to the situations 
found in the environment. 
Other Evidence from Observation.—Numerous ob- 
servations of moths, wasps, bees and other insects make 
certain the existence of complex instincts in these organ- 
isms. The Yucca moth, for example, immediately after 
emerging from its chrysalis, without observation of older 
moths, begins to collect pollen, and having kneaded it 
into a pellet, flies away to another flower. Having found 
another Yucca flower, the moth pierces its pistil and lays
-P-A-G-E-141
  NATIVE EQUIPMENT 125 
her eggs among the ovules. The bit of adhesive pollen is 
then stuffed into the funnel shaped opening from the 
top of the stigma. This series of nicely adjusted actions, 
each one essential to the hatching of the eggs, and the 
life of the grub, is done too soon and too perfectly to be 
accounted for by learning; it is unquestionably instinc- 
tive. The early or rapid appearance of walking, run- 
ning, scratching, swimming, huddling, ruffling feathers 
when cold, stretching feathers to avoid sunlight, and the 
even more complex acts of stalking prey, gathering and 
hoarding food, of fighting, running away, hiding, sham- 
ming death in several species suggests strongly that many 
of such abilities are instinctive. The highly complex 
activities of courtship and mating, of building nests or 
other habitations, of hatching eggs and caring for the 
young, are believed to be in many species so complex, 
so universal and invariable, and so prompt to appear at 
the proper time as to make inheritance a far more likely 
explanation than learning. 
While it is probable that many activities in animals 
are learned it is also probable that many reactions, both 
simple and complex, are instinctive, as flying, pecking, 
and catching mice appear to be. The evidence indicates 
also that very complex activities such as nest building 
and caring for the young are mainly unlearned in certain 
species. That very complex activities in insects are in- 
stinctive is conclusively established as the result of many. 
careful observations. 
Some students—as was mentioned earlier—are dis- 
posed to think of the human species as a close kin of the 
lower animals with respect to native equipment. Finding 
evidence that complex patterns of response are inherited 
by animals they are convinced that in man many complex 
aets are also native. 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
126 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
OBJECTIONS TO THE VIEW OF ExTENSIvE EQUIPMENT OF 
Sreciric Instincts In Man. 
  To this view there are other competent students who 
object. They object, first, to the argument that man has 
all of these varieties of instinctive equipment because 
they appear in animals. They do not deny the theory of 
evolution but assert that as the human species developed 
from lower mammalian forms native equipment ran less 
extensively to specific instinctive activities and more to 
intelligence and the capacity to learn. Man, they main- 
tain, differs from the lower animals by possessing greater 
aptitude for learning, for profane by experience and a 
relatively long period of*infancy in which to acquire 
adaptations to his surrounding. He differs from the 
lower organisms, secondly, by possessing fewer ready- 
made adjustments, fewer specific instincts. More than 
other animals, it is urged, man is left to mold his be- ~ 
havior according to the situations and needs encountered; 
more than other organisms he is freed from the blind 
impulses of inherited specific reactions. 
These students object, secondly, to universality as a 
suggestive test of nativeness. They point out that en- 
vironment and life everywhere have a great deal in 
common and that what are often called instincts are 
really habits universal in range. For example, walking 
is everywhere useful and infants are encouraged to prac- 
tice it; dodging’ missiles, fleeing from large strange beasts, 
fighting, hunting and other activities would be likely to 
be acquired everywhere in much the same forms because 
human structures and mechanisms and human environ- 
ments everywhere are much the same. 
It must be admitted that both of these objections are 
not unreasonable. It is really quite impossible to gen-
-P-A-G-E-143
NATIVE EQUIPMENT 127 
eralize with confidence from the test of universality or 
the existence of hereditary patterns of reactions in 
animals, concerning the instinctive equipment of man. 
Both of these lines of evidence are suggestive, but not 
conclusive. This being the case, it will be advisable to 
limit the inventory of specific instincts in-‘man to observa- 
tions and experiments based directly upon the human 
species. 
Tue Osservep Instinctive-Motor REAcTIONS OF 
Human INFANTS. 
Unfortunately, observations of the genesis and devel- 
opment of behavior in man—that is, studies of the 
human infant from birth—of a thorough and valid sort 
are very few and have been for short periods. Scarcely 
a single example of experimentation of the sort performed 
on birds, chicks and kittens, is to be found. Great un- 
certainty exists, therefore, concerning the character of 
nearly all of the complex acts which appear after the 
first few months of life. No more can be done than to 
present briefly the results of limited observations on+ 
infants together with a few speculations concerning later 
development. 
The instinctive reactions in man may be grouped for »— 
- convenience under the following headings: 
1. Adjustments of the sense organs. 
2. Seeking and accepting reactions. 
3. Protective reactions. 
4. Locomotion. 
5. Vocalization. 
6. Manipulation. 
1. Adjustments of the Sense Organs.—Observations 
of infants during the first day of life (by Watson) indi- 
cate that all of the sense organs are functioning. Re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  128 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
sponses may be elicited through stimulation of the organs 
in the skin, the eye, and ear; taste and smell are probably 
active also. During the first day the infant shows the 
fairly complex adjustments of the head and eyes required 
to fixate a bright light. This means that the reactions 
resulting in the proper regulation of the accessory ap- 
paratus of the sense organ are native. The newly born 
infant seems capable, moreover, of attention, which in- 
volves not only adjustment of the sense organs but the 
curtailment of other activities and the making of certain 
complex neural adjustments. The young infant, in other 
words, is not merely a passive victim of sensory stimula- 
tion but it is from the first actively and to some degree, 
selectively, responsive to external influences. 
A gradual progress of sensory control and of ability 
to attend or to isolate for sensory observation is apparent. 
For some time the infant fixates visually only very in- 
tense or mobile things. The definite visual fixation of 
the immobile human face or objects in the room appears 
clearly within a few weeks and later a disposition to 
explore actively with eyes, fingers, and tongue. These 
abilities seem to be native though they are clumsy and 
poorly codrdinated at first. They correspond to the 
flowering of curiosity. Indeed, if we are not deceived 
by appearances, the child early gives evidence of striving 
to comprehend the things and events about him. He 
appears instinctively to be curious, to explore, to seek to 
learn. 
2. Seeking and Accepting Reactions.—Since the ad- 
justments of eye and ear to distant stimuli from the 
things about him—with the exception of a few very 
intense or striking events such as the moving light held 
near—appear some time after birth, the infant’s earliest 
reactions are aroused mainly by stimuli from within the
-P-A-G-E-145
  NATIVE EQUIPMENT 129 
body such as pangs of hunger, or by forces which im- 
pinge upon the body’s surface. What we may call seek- 
ing or accepting reactions are early observed. The food 
seeking and accepting reactions are prominent. A slight 
touch on the face, especially the cheek, usually elicits a 
quick turning of the head, opening of the mouth and 
sucking reaction. When the infant is hungry, this 
response is surprisingly quick, often catching the stimu- 
lating finger. When the infant is satiated, the response 
may not appear or at least it may appear more slowly. 
The internal condition is an important factor here; the 
reaction is a response not wholly to the external stimulus 
alone but to a combination of the external and internal 
stimuli. When the child is hungry, it often appears to 
be seeking food. Repeated touches especially will set up 
active turning and mouthing movements. Swallowing 
completes this series of accepting movements. 
Another form of accepting reaction is the grasp with 
the fingers which occurs when a harmless object touches 
the palm. So firm is this grasp that soon after birth the 
infant may be pulled entirely from its support, sustain- 
ing its whole weight with one hand closed about a small 
stick. 
Other forms of accepting reactions take a passive form 
—quiescence, repose, submission, inactivity. These are, 
however, to be considered as positive reactions. The 
struggling brought about by interfering with breathing 
or movement, by hot or cold, and by pain, internal or 
external, gives way to relaxation when the infant is 
turned, or the stimulus otherwise removed. Sleep is 
- undoubtedly the extreme form of quiescence and relaxa- 
tion; it is quite as instinctive, quite as much a reaction 
to stimuli as sucking or grasping although the stimuli 
are undoubtedly complex, including both inner and outer 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
130 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
  conditions. During waking hours, varied acceptance 
reactions are made to conditions which embrace moderate 
warmth, internal comfort, filled stomach, ete., and a 
certain freedom for movement. The responses to these 
conditions are repose or playful activities plus what may 
be described as contentment. The child’s reaction is that 
of acceptance which may be contrasted with rejecting 
and struggling, to be described later. 
The contented acceptance type of response, including 
attempts at smiling and a cooing and gurgling that may 
contain the roots of laughter, appears very early as the 
response to gentle stroking and manipulation of certain 
parts of the body, to gentle shaking, rocking, patting, etc. 
A little later, according to one observer (Watson) the 
child extends the arms when stimulated in these ways. 
Conceivably this is the initial stage of the embrace of love, 
although such an idea is speculative. Sex behavior, 
which does not appear in intelligible form until in the 
teens, must be classed among the instinctive reactions of 
the seeking and accepting type. As in food seeking, the 
hereditary stimulus in sex is partly or perhaps mainly an 
inner condition. To what extent the overt acts of court- 
ship are inherited is at present problematical. 
For some time after birth, the infant appears to grasp 
only those objects which come in direct contact with the 
body. According to certain observations (by Watson) 
the child is able to reach and grasp objects seen at a short 
distance at least by the end of the fourth month. Fairly 
effective eye-hand coérdinations, such as the reaching 
and grasping of a watch, piece of candy, etc., then appear 
without earlier practice. Shortly the child appears to 
reach for all sorts of objects excepting only those which 
are too distant, too intense—such as paper burning in a 
» metal basket, or a loudly barking dog—or too vigorously
-P-A-G-E-147
NATIVE EQUIPMENT 131 
active, such as a struggling pigeon. To such distant, 
intense or active objects the young infant reacts by intent 
observation. If the object comes nearer, or ceases to act 
in a violent manner, the infant usually attempts to seize 
it. For a time, the objects once clutched are usually 
carried toward the mouth, although a little later manipu- 
lation frequently follows seizure. Probably still later, it 
is instinctive to pursue such objects as small animals and 
capture them but it cannot be said with certainty that 
such reactions are hereditary. At least, it is apparent 
that reaching and grasping are native responses elicited 
early by a large number of objects—almost all small 
objects. Gradually the infant learns which of these 
produce pain or discomfort, and consequently soon fails 
to seize them; which are tasteful and henceforth carried 
to the mouth; which are noisy, mobile, ete., and hence- 
forth are manipulated in various ways. Probably only 
the general codrdinated acts of seizing, pulling toward 
the body, carrying to the mouth or variously manipulat- 
ing are strictly native. The attachment of one of these 
forms of treatment, rather than others, to each particular 
object is acquired. 
8. Protective Reactions.-A considerable number of 
reactions elicited by stimuli which are often, if not 
always, harmful appear immediately or shortly after 
birth. Such reactions take the forms of avoiding or . 
escaping from, of pushing off or getting rid of the stimu- 
lus, of struggling, or of other protective responses such 
as closing the mouth or eyes. These early appearing 
reactions are often called prepotent since they take 
precedence over all others; they occur promptly at all 
times and may supplant other activities under way at 
the time. The biological utility of the prepotency of 
the protective responses is apparent. 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
132 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Escaping Reactions—To a number of physical con- 
tacts, the infant almost immediately after birth reacts by 
movements which usually result in escape from the 
stimulus. The foot or hand will be retracted from the 
application of a cold or hot stimulus, from a prick, tickle 
or pinch. If the stimulus is applied to parts not easily 
withdrawn, the infant will struggle until the body has 
been moved or the stimulus withdrawn. If the infant’s 
face is placed in a pillow, it will promptly turn the head 
to the side. As the child grows older, more complex 
reactions of escape, including turning about and flight, 
make their appearance but as yet it is impossible to say 
to what extent these retreats are native. Doubtless the 
instinctive responses are rapidly and considerably modi- 
fied by experience. 
Rejecting Reactions—To stimuli applied to certain 
parts of the body, the infant’s reaction is a thrust or 
push which often results in getting rid of the stimulus. 
During the day after birth, infants will push off with the 
one foot the hand of the investigator which pinches 
lightly the other knee. Very early the hands will push 
at pressures applied to upper parts of the body, such as 
the nose. To a strong stimulus, the infant’s response is 
quite prompt and vigorous. If the pinching persists, 
the thrust becomes more violent, and may be accom- 
panied by widespread bodily struggling and crying. 
Pushing substances from the mouth with the tongue, 
vomiting, sneezing and coughing are early -appearing 
native reactions which result in the rejecting of undesired 
and harmful substances. To sticky and dirty substances 
placed on most parts of the body, the infant pays little 
attention, ie., there are few if any instinctive reactions 
to secure cleanliness. 
Struggling and Fighting—When the head, arm, nose 
   
-P-A-G-E-149
  NATIVE EQUIPMENT 133 
or other member of an infant is held in such a way that 
withdrawal from or removal of the restraining force is 
not at once achieved, there at once begins a struggle 
which becomes more violent until the whole body is 
engaged. Crying or screaming usually accompanies the 
struggle. In such activities are forms both of repelling 
and escaping reactions; the infants struggle either to 
throw off the offending stimulus or to escape it. These 
activities constitute the earliest form of fighting; a re- 
sponse which is clearly instinctive. In later years, fight- 
ing continues to be an instinctive reaction to persistent 
interference with locomotion, eating, sleeping or other 
activities. Fighting takes on new details of form as the 
body develops; the native responses consist in the use in 
a violent and directed form, of all of the weapons—arms, 
fingers, legs, feet, and possibly teeth—with which the 
species is equipped. Instinctive struggling and fighting 
are violent but nevertheless crude. In contests among 
individuals equal in strength, the trained boxer or 
wrestler is markedly superior. Even in such primitive 
activities, it is possible to improve vastly on native 
behavior. 
4, Locomotion.—The mature forms of locomotion— 
walking and running—involve a number of complex ac- 
tivities that do not appear at the same time. Holding 
up and balancing the head appear early and are doubt- 
less native. Turning the body about while lying down 
has been observed within the first week. Creeping, the 
first form of locomotion, varies so much:in character 
among different infants as to suggest a considerable influ- 
ence of learning. Standing erect and walking do not 
appear at first in as fully perfected form as does flying in 
birds or walking in calves and other species yet many 
maintain that the maturation is native though slow.
-P-A-G-E-150
134 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
  Conclusive observations or experiments are not as yet 
available. The same uncertainty prevails concerning 
running, climbing, balancing on a moving object such 
as a wagon, ete. Swimming is certainly not instinctive ; 
young infants show great fear and no useful activities 
when immersed in water. 
5. Vocalization.—The native oral responses appear to 
be few and simple. Certain types of crying and scream- 
ing appear at birth in response to cold and various pains, 
hunger, being held tightly and other discomforts. Coo- 
ings and gurgling appear during pleasing experiences and 
probably a sort of lawghter is native. In addition to 
these, a considerable number of single sounds appear in 
innumerable arrangements none of which is very stable 
or characteristic. Out of these elementary oral responses, 
complex patterns are acquired as the result of practice. 
Nearly all of the individual enunciations—shouts, whim- 
pers, sing-songs, etc., as well as the speaking language, 
are patterned after models which its surroundings pro- 
vide. The human vocal apparatus, like those of other 
species, has its limitations; not every type of sound pat- 
tern can be imitated however great and prolonged the 
practice. 
6. Manipulation.—Aside from the’ manual reactions 
already described under seeking and accepting and under. 
protective activities, the well formed native adjustments 
of a complex character are few. As in vocalization, 
nearly all of the manual abilities of the child of six or of 
the adult are learned. The degree of difficulty encoun- 
tered in learning a particular ability—holding a spoon, 
turning a key, whittling, ete.,—depends mainly, however, 
upon the native limitations of the hands in both struc- 
ture and inherent aptitude. The first of these is the in- 
herited characteristic of handedness, ranging from a pro-
-P-A-G-E-151
  NATIVE EQUIPMENT 135 
nounced superiority of the right hand through ambidex- 
terity to left-handedness. Estimates of the number of 
natively left-handed vary from two to six per cent; the 
ambidextrous are few, leaving over 90 per cent right- 
handed in various degrees. Efforts to force the use of 
the natively inferior hand, of “going against nature” in 
this way, result frequently in nervous disturbances. 
Similar native differences exist among the digits of either 
hand; the two fingers adjoining the thumb are more 
mobile and adaptable than the other two. The usual 
form of holding a pencil in writing has resulted doubtless 
from the discovery of the greater ease of learning when 
the chief work is done with the thumb and first two 
fingers with the other digits playing a supplementary 
réle. It would be a more difficult task to learn to write 
by placing the burden of activity on the last two fingers. 
Conscious Reactions, NaTIvE AND ACQUIRED 
Native Equipment for Conscious Reactions.—The 
machinery for conscious action is given by nature quite 
as muscles and glands are and it would be surprising if 
there were native responses of the latter and none of 
the former. It is, we think, a most plausible assump- 
tion that the infant has conscious experiences from the 
moment his sense organs and muscles begin to act in 
relation to external situations. What types of conscious 
processes probably appear immediately after birth and 
which ones are, presumably due to native capacities, 
that is, to inborn organizations, of the neural apparatus? 
Sensations.—Doubtless sensory experiences or sensa- 
tions are experienced at once. These processes will em- 
brace, at least typically, qualities determined by the par- 
ticular sense organs and cortical neurones stimulated. 
By qualities we mean the color, red or blue, the taste
-P-A-G-E-152
  136 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
sweet or sour, the tactile experience pressure or cold. 
How much more than these qualities are experienced in 
the infant’s first contacts with light waves or other stim- 
uli from objects in the environment, that is, how much 
the experience embraces awareness of position, size, shape, 
distance, or significance, such as desirability or unde- 
sirability, we cannot tell. Certainly most of that which 
makes up the significance of the stimulating situation is 
acquired during later experience. 
Feelings and Emotions.—The feelings of pleasantness 
and unpleasantness and various emotions such as joyful- 
ness, fear and anger are doubtless within the child’s early 
conscious experiences. The physical organizations un- 
derlying these feelings and emotions are native and the 
observable behavior of infants suggests that soon after 
birth appropriate stimuli throw the mechanisms into 
action. 
Impulses.—An impulse is a conscious experience which 
precedes some action. It is the awareness of the state 
of readiness for some response. It is felt as an urge to 
carry through the reaction for which one is prepared. 
When on the verge of a sneeze, the impulse to sneeze is 
clearly conscious. When hungry, we feel an impulse to 
secure and eat food; when tired, an impulse to rest; 
when sad, an urge to weep. The infant doubtless ex- 
periences impulses of many sorts and some of them, such 
as the impulse to rest, sleep and eat and perhaps others, 
are native. 
Percepts, Images, and Ideas.—In addition to sensa- 
tions, feelings, emotions and impulses, adults have a rich 
life of conscious experiences based upon facts acquired 
through sensory perception and later recalled during 
recollection, imagination, day dreaming, reasoning and 
other types of thinking. Things, complex events, facts 
\
-P-A-G-E-153
  NATIVE EQUIPMENT 137 
of all kinds come to be known to us by use of the senses. 
These facts are not given us by nature but grow out of 
our experience...What is given us by nature is merely 
the machinery for learning and an urge to learn. The 
facts themselves, all forms of knowledge, are acquired. 
Facts which come to us through use of the senses may 
be recalled when no sensory stimulus is present. Re- 
called facts are the materials with which we think. The 
facts with which we think are acquired. In other words, 
though the capacities to acquire facts during sensory 
perception and to recall facts are native, our particular 
percepts, images and ideas are acquired. 
In chapters to follow, the nature and significance of 
sensations, feelings, emotions, impulses and urges, the 
capacity to learn and think, and the processes of acquir- 
ing facts will be treated in detail. 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. Do you judge that the text would harmonize with this state- 
ment: “Because the mother was terrified by an accident before 
the birth of the child, the offspring has always shown an unusual 
fear at the sight of blood”? 
2. Criticise or defend this argument. “Since birth is only an event 
in the development from the embryo to adulthood, the appear- 
ance at birth of activities and impulses, which could not have 
been acquired, sweeps aside all theoretical objections to the 
appearance at any time of inherited activities and impulses.” 
3. Which of the following are most likely to be native, which 
acquired? Why? 
Situation Response 
a. Sight of a gun fear 
b. Food in mouth salivary secretion 
ec. Sight of a bear fear

CHAPTER VI 
SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 
Sensation is a native response in the sense that we are 
born with sense organs, sensory nerves and brain, so 
arranged that the stimulus will produce the conscious 
response soon after birth as soon as a certain stage of 
inner growth is achieved, The stimulus, after the first 
few hours of experience at least, arouses a conscious 
response more complex than sensation. It arouses per- 
cepts of things and events, which immediately follow the 
sensation. The exact nature of the percepts is deter- 
mined greatly by experience but the sensation, which 
is the bare awareness of the qualities of objects, is more 
uniform and little influenced by experience except in so 
far as the sense organs, nerves or brain may be injured by 
work, accident, disease, etc. Sensations are distinguished 
from each other chiefly by their qualities—as redness is — 
distinguished from cold—and a considerable portion of 
the chapter will be devoted to a study of sensation- 
qualities. 
Sensations and feelings will be treated together in 
this chapter partly for the reason that they are rarely 
separated in popular speech and partly because some in- 
vestigators hold that all of the experiences which we call 
“feelings” turn out to be groups of sensations. In ordi- 
nary conversation we say: “I feel—cold, hot, excited, 
pleased, hungry, angry,” but we do not say, at least for 
literal interpretation: “I feel—green, salt, aromatic, or 
141
-P-A-G-E-158
142 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
noise.” In the latter instances we say: “I see a green 
color,” “I taste salt,” “I smell an aromatic odor,” or “I 
hear a noise.” Apparently, we say that we see, hear, 
taste or smell or, in general, that we sense things which 
are experienced through these special senses, but that we 
“feel” conditions in or on the body. One of the tasks 
before us in this chapter is to ascertain what the differ- 
ences, if any, are between all of these experiences. To 
accomplish this task we must begin by: describing and 
classifying sensations. An understandin of the nature 
of sensations and feelings will pave thé way, moreover, 
for a discussion of emotions which, according to one 
theory, are really complex blends of sensations. 
  SENSATIONS oF TASTE 
The problems involved in the analysis of sensations in 
general are illustrated by those encountered in studying 
tastes. First, it is necessary to be sure that the sensa- 
tions grouped under taste are really gustatory sensations 
and not some other sort, such as odors or skin sensations. 
In many of the studies, therefore, introspections are taken 
before and after the sense organs of smell have been 
bottled up by plugging the nasal passages, or the sense 
of pain or touch is temporarily abolished by drugs. Most 
introspective study is carried on under such controlled 
conditions. Second, it is necessary to test the effects of 
all possible sorts of normal stimuli lest some kinds of 
sensations be overlooked. This means at least sampling 
a very large variety of substances, the sensations aroused 
by which are carefully observed and the similarities to 
and differences from others noted. The task is eventually 
to ascertain what are the really primary or elementary 
tastes and which are compounds of these.~ 
Ways in Which Sensory Experiences Differ.—There
-P-A-G-E-159
SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 143 
  are an immense number of different tastes. By “differ- 
ent” we mean “distinguishable.” In distinguishing one 
taste from another, it is found that various clues are 
utilized. (First, some tastes which are about the same 
in quality; may be discriminated because of differences in 
intensity. / Solutions of salt are all alike in being “salty” 
but some are stronger or more intense than others. All 
sensations differ similarly in intensity:—lights, sounds, 
pains, all vary from very weak to very intense. (Second, 
some tastes are alike in quality, such as saltness, and in 
intensity or strength but differ in what is sometimes 
called extensity or amount. JA given salt solution may 
be applied to the taste buds in small areas of the tongue 
or to all of the sense organs by taking a large mouthful. 
The quality and intensity of the sensations may be made 
about the same but as a whole the experience differs 
because of the extensity of stimulation. Most other sen- 
sations, lights, pressures, or pains, may be distinguished 
on the basis of the amount or extent of the area stimu- 
lated. (Third, sensory experiences, alike in quality, in- 
tensity and extensity may differ in duration.) A taste 
of salt, a sound, color, pain, etc., may last different 
lengths of time. Variations in the intensity, extensity 
and duration of the sensory experience make possible a 
large number of discriminable effects. The main prob» 
lem, however, is to ascertain in all the possible distin- 
guishable sensory experiences the elementary, irreducible 
qualities. 
The Primary Tastes or Taste Qualities.—In the case 
of taste, introspective study has revealed that in all the 
discriminable sensations, there are only four distinct 
taste qualities, namely, sweet, sour, salt and _ bitter. 
These tastes are called elementary sensation-qualities 
(or we may to avoid monotony sometimes call. them 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
144 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
  primary or elementary tastes) since they cannot be re- 
duced to anything simpler. 
Compound Sensations or Sensation Qualities.—Most 
substances which we taste arouse at once more than one 
of these qualities in some degree. Lemonade really pro- 
duces the qualities sweet and sour; grapefruit yields a 
combination of sweet, sour and bitter. Like lemonade 
or grapefruit, most other foods such as sweetened 
chocolate or ice cream, while usually conceived to have 
a more or less unified taste, are really combinations. 
They are called compound sensations or compound 
sensation-qualities since they may be reduced to two or 
more of the primary qualities. Since any degree of in- 
tensity of any one taste may be combined with each of 
many degrees of intensity in one or more of the other 
three tastes, the total number of compound tastes which 
may be produced is enormous. 
Blends of Tastes with Other Types of Sensation 
Qualities—Experience seems to conflict with the idea 
that all tastes are limited to combinations of these four 
primary qualities. We think that we are sensitive to 
fine differences in the “tastes” of potatoes, turnips and 
carrots; indeed, we are aware of differences in the same 
vegetable in accordance with the way it is cooked. In- 
trospective study has shown, however, that most of these 
distinctions are due not to differences in taste but to 
variations in other types of sensations, especially to 
odors, pressures, muscular sensations and pain. 
Tastes are confused with odors very readily. Juices 
extracted from onions and potatoes taste almost alike 
when the organs of smell are bottled up by a plug in the 
upper nasal passageway. Under these conditions coffee . 
and a weak solution of quinine taste alike, slightly bitter; 
certain wines taste like weak vinegar; many fruit juices 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  
  SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 145 
taste alike except for variations in sweet and sour. The 
odors of these substances are far more important char- 
acteristics than tastes. 
Sensations from the linings of the mouth and nose 
also fuse with tastes and odors to make a total experience 
which we mistake for mere taste. Raw and mashed 
potatoes taste the same but feel different in the mouth. 
Cold coffee is different from hot not at all because of 
taste, not wholly because of smell but partly because 
of the coldness and heat. Charged water tastes the same_ 
as uncharged but it bubbles, stimulating pressure sense © 
organs, and by influencing other nerve endings produces 
a mild sting. Spices are almost wholly odors and sting; 
peppermint is almost wholly odor and cold; olive oil, 
castor oil, and unsalted butter differ only in smell and 
“feel.” Nuts differ from mashed potatoes partly in odor 
and partly in the muscular sensations aroused in chewing 
as well as in impressions on the surface membranes. 
The Stimuli which Arouse Taste Sensations.—The 
stimuli which arouse the sense organs of taste are chemi- 
cal substances in liquid form. Doubtless some general 
chemical composition is found in all substances which 
taste sweet or sour or salty or bitter but it is not now 
possible to write the general formula corresponding to 
each taste. 
SENSATIONS OF SMELL. 
The sensations of smell, which may also be called olfac- 
tory sensations or odors, result from the action of chemi- 
cal substances, dissolved in air, upon receptors in the 
nasal cavity. The total number of discriminable olfac- 
tory sensations is very large and until recently identifica- 
tion of the primary qualities and the classification of 
odors under them have been far from complete. The
-P-A-G-E-162
  146 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
recent investigations of Henning—who trained himself 
to a high degree of expertness in this field—have yielded 
the nearest approach to an analysis of odors. He finds 
six elementary odors or olfactory qualities as follows, 
- each corresponding to a characteristic of the chemical 
- stimulus: 
1. Fruity odors, such as are found in apples, grapes, 
orange oil, vinegar, etc. 
2. Flowery odors, found in pansy, carnations, ete. 
8. Spicy, found in cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, ete. 
4. Resinous, found in pitch, balsam, turpentine, ete. 
5. Smoky, found in burnt substances, tar, pyri- 
due, ete. 
. Putrid, found in decaying matter, limburger 
cheese, hydrogen sulphide, ete. 
As in other sensations, the pure odor is rather rare; 
compound odors which may be reduced to two or more of 
these six elements are the rule. Variations in the rela- 
tive intensity of the component odors make the total 
number of combined olfactory sensations very large. 
The Relation of Stimulus to Sensation in Taste and 
Smell.—The first curious relation of stimulus and re- 
sponse in the case of taste and smell appears in the 
phenomenon of adaptation. After the stimulus is ap- 
plied the response—the taste or odor—rapidly rises to a 
maximum and then, although the stimulus is continu- 
ously applied as at first, the conscious reaction gradually 
decreases in vividness. When you enter a paint shop or 
candy store you may note that the characteristic odor, 
at first very vivid, gradually decreases in intensity. The 
clerk who has been subjected to the stimulus a long time 
scarcely notices it at all. Adaptation occurs to taste 
stimuli too. After eating a dish of ice cream, it always 
requires more sugar to get the desired sweet sensation a
-P-A-G-E-163
SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 147 
  from the coffee. By the usual lump, only a weak sensa- 
tion of sweet would be aroused. Adaptation, then, de- 
scribes the fact that the response gradually decreases in 
vividness with prolongation of a stimulus. Adaptation 
is much like fatigue yet it differs from muscular fatigue. 
It is much quicker than the fatigue resulting from normal 
muscular action, and the recovery is usually more prompt. 
Wash out the mouth, especially with a sour substance, 
and the sensitivity to sweet quickly returns. Take a few 
breaths of fresh air and sensitivity to an odor reappears. 
Adaptation, moreover, does not give us any conscious 
symptoms of fatigue as continued muscular work does, 
and, furthermore, adaptation has definite beneficial re- 
sults in some instances at least. These beneficial results 
appear clearest in vision during the discussion of which 
we shall return to the topic. 
Another peculiarity in the relation of stimulus and 
response appears in the fact that adaptation to one 
stimulus often increases the vividness of the response to 
others. (Adaptation to sweet increases sensitivity to 
sour; adaptation to sour increases responsiveness to 
sweet; tasting a salt solution heightens the effects of 
both sour and sweet, and tasting bitter increases sweet.'~ 
Similar effects are found in reactions with odorous stimuli 
and in vision we shall see the most pronounced results. 
These effects are often called successive contrast effects. 
Simultaneous contrast effects, in which the presentation 
of one stimulus brings about a more active response to 
another applied at the same time, are apparent in vision 
but not so clear in taste and smell. 
Another phenomenon is the after-sensation, the con- 
tinuation of a sensation after the external stimulus has 
been. removed. This occurs in all senses, most pro- 
nouncedly in wision. The internal response lags behind
-P-A-G-E-164
148 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
the stimulus when it is applied and it continues after 
it has been removed. The inner machinery, once it gets 
under way, requires a few moments to halt and until it 
has ceased activity the sensation may persist. We shall 
turn now to vision where these phenomena and some 
others may be actually demonstrated. 
  VisuaL SENSATIONS. 
In describing the qualities of visual and other sensory 
experiences, care must be exercised to distinguish be- 
tween the stimulus and the response since they are 
habitually confused in every day speech. Red and green 
and other colors are sensations. They are conscious 
states; they exist only in us. They are our conscious 
reactions to the stimuli. The stimuli are waves in the 
ether; they are not colors. When we say the apple is 
red we are really speaking a little loosely since the red 
is not in the apple but in our consciousness. The apple 
merely reflects from its surface to the eye certain ether 
waves. There are some persons who are quite or nearly 
color blind. The light waves from the apple arouse in 
them not a red sensation but a gray. The stimuli for 
the two observers were the same but the reactions were 
different. 
In the laboratory, the investigator usually utilizes 
colored papers as a means of securing visual stimuli. A 
“colored” paper is one which reflects into the eyes only 
certain light waves, having absorbed others. A “red” 
paper is one which reflects into the eye primarily those 
light waves which arouse in the observer the sensation 
red; a “blue” paper reflects those waves which arouse 
‘the sensation blue. Such papers, therefore, provide a 
convenient means of securing visual stimuli. 
Elementary Visual Sensation-Qualitie:—The quali- 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  
SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 149 
ties of visual sensations are usually divided into two 
groups, the colors and colorless qualities. A great many 
colors are given particular names: red, orange, yellow, 
yellow-green, or olive, green, green-blue or peacock, blue, 
indigo, violet, purple and others. Are all of these color 
qualities elementary or may they be reduced to a small 
number from which others are made by combination? 
According to most observers all of the thousands of 
discriminable colors contain only the qualities of four, 
namely, red, yellow, green and blue. These four are 
therefore called the primary or elementary color-qualities. 
That all other hues are really not totally unlike these 
four may be disclosed by studying the sensations set up 
by pieces of “colored” paper. Start with red, comparing 
it with orange. Now a deep orange has a reddish hue, and 
contains also a tinge of yellow, but no one can see in 
orange anything wholly different from these two. It 
seems to be a mixture or blend of red and yellow. Some 
oranges are very much like red; others closely resemble 
yellow. Indeed one may arrange a whole series of 
orange hues, beginning with red and terminating with 
yellow. Yellow is not exactly a sharp point in this 
belt since these are several perceptible hues where it 
merges with orange, that may better be described as 
different yellow hues rather than as very yellowish 
oranges; the blending is very gradual. On the other side 
of yellow, it is possible to select a series of hue which, 
beginning with yellow ever so slightly tinged with green, 
later becomes about an even mixture which merges 
finally with pure green. Beyond green may be arranged 
another series, at the middle of which is a blue-green, 
approximately what is sometimes called peacock. Blue- 
green gradually merges with genuine blue. Other hues 
left on our hands now are indigo, violet and purple. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  150 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Indigo is certainly much like blue with a slight tinge of 
red, the color from which we started in arranging the 
belt of colors. Violet and purple are even more like red 
and crimson is very much like red with a tinge of blue. 
Indeed, these colors are steps in a continuum between 
blue and red. Thus, all of the colors sensations are con- 
tinuous, forming a belt which describes a circle, the 
color circle. The whole series consist either of red, yel- 
low, green and blue, or a blend of any two of these which 
are adjoining in the circle. 
The Colorless Visual Qualities—Black and White.— 
In addition to the colors, there are two other visual 
qualities, black and white, which have a claim to in- 
clusion in the groups of elementary sensation-qualities. 
White, introspectively, is not like red, yellow, or any 
other color nor is it like black. The same is true of 
black; it is itself and nothing else. Both are distinctive 
sensations which must be included in the group of ele- 
ments, along with red, yellow, green and blue. 
Just as there is a series of blends, between adjoining 
primary colors, so there is a continuum between white 
and black. Gray is a sensation resembling both white 
and black just as orange is a sensation resembling both 
red and yellow. White and black are called primary for 
the same reason that red and yellow are. The primary 
visual sensation-qualities, then, are six: red, yellow, 
green, blue, white and black. These are called elemen- 
tary because in any particular visual sensation whatso- 
ever we find no qualities that are utterly different from 
any of these. 
Compound Visual Sensations.—While all of the colors 
may be reduced to four primary color-qualities, red, 
yellow, blue and green, there are many intermediate or 
compound colors, such as orange and blue-green in the
-P-A-G-E-167
  SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 151 
circle of purest or most saturated colors. In the whole 
circle of colors, the average person can distinguish about 
160 colors, in the sense that he can perceive a difference 
between each and the others. A certain orange is per- 
ceived, for example, as slightly more reddish than those 
| adjoining on one side and more yellowish than those ad- 
joining on the other side in the'circle. By going com- 
pletely around the circle in this manner, about 160 dif- 
ferent stages can be distinguished. 
Any one of these distinguishable colors, whether pure 
green, slightly bluish-green, slightly yellowish-green or 
whatnot, may be combined with any shade of gray, thus 
producing what we call shades of the color. If we mix 
a certain vivid red with gray of identical shade or bright- 
ness, the result is a quality combining red and gray. We 
do not see each quality separately, of course. The result 
is a compound sensation; the qualities are fused. What 
we see is a duller—not a darker or lighter—red. The 
red, without becoming darker or lighter, that is, without 
changing its shade, becomes less full, vivid or saturated. 
Adding more gray, further dulls the red without changing 
its essential red quality. If you keep on adding gray, 
the red gets less and less saturated until it is swamped 
altogether, leaving only gray. Similarly, any color may 
‘be mixed with a gray of its own shade or brightness, and 
when so mixed the result is a sensation possessing both 
the qualities of gray and the color. The changes are 
called changes in saturation. Adding gray reduces the 
saturation. 
Colors can be changed in another way which may be 
described introspectively, as the mixing of the color 
quality with a gray of a shade lighter or darker than the 
saturated color possesses. In the grays, ranging from the 
brightest white to the deepest black, an average person
-P-A-G-E-168
152 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
    can discriminate about 700 steps. Only one of these 
shades of gray exactly matches in brightness the shade 
of the color when it is most vivid or saturated. Now, 
by adding to the saturated color, say red, a lighter gray, 
the effect of a lighter shade of the red quality is pro- 
duced. A darker gray fuses with the same red to pro- 
duce a darker shade of red. Pink, for example, is intro- 
spectively a mixture of red and light gray; it is lighter 
and also less saturated than the most. vivid red but it 
contains only the qualities of redness and of grey. Since 
gray may be reduced to black and white, pink includes 
the qualities of red, black and white, in which white 
predominates over black. Olive is, introspectively, a 
blend of yellow and green, and moderately dark gray, i.e. 
of yellow, green, white and black. Brown, similarly, is a 
combination of dark gray (or white and black with the 
latter predominating) and orange (or red and yellow 
combined). Every visual sensation, then, may be re- 
duced in this way to the primary qualities, red, yellow, 
blue, green, black and. white. Most sensations are com- 
pounds of these qualities. Counting all of the primary 
qualities and all combinations, the total number of dis- 
tinguishable sensations amounts to at least 30,000 for the 
average person. 
We shall next consider the character of the stimuli 
which arouse visual sensations. In vision the relations 
of the stimuli and the conscious reactions, the sensations, 
are unusually complex due to the fact that different 
stimuli will activate the same responses. 
The Stimuli for Visual Sensations.—Stated in terms 
of the lengths, or distance from crest to crest, light waves 
which affect the retina form a continuous series from 
about 760 to 390 millionths of a millimeter. When waves 
of the same length strike the eye, particular colors sen-
-P-A-G-E-169
  SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 153, 
sations are activated. Some of the light waves with the 
corresponding sensations are as follows: 
_Wave Lengths in Millionths of a 
  Millimeter Color Sensations 
760-646 reds 
647-587 orang 
588-549 eee 
550-491 greens 
492-454 blues 
455-390 violets 
It will be understood that the color sensations are 
not sharply divided but are continuous as described 
above. Hach wave length produces a particular sensa- 
tion; wave length 577 produces what is generally ac- 
cepted as primary yellow; 587 would be a very yellow 
with a tinge of red; 567 would be a greenish yellow. 
The stimulus series is straightforward in its corre- 
spondence to the steps on the color circle, with two 
striking exceptions. The waves for violet and red, colors 
similar as sensations, are at the extremes of the series, 
760 for red, 390 for violet. Between violet and red, 
resembling both, is the color hue purple, which, unlike 
all the others, is not produced by single light waves, but 
. by various combinations of those which singly produce 
red and violet. Neither of these facts would be suspected 
from the study of the color sensations alone. 
Color Mixing.—While every light wave in the visible 
range produces some specific color hue,—a statement 
which-cannot be reversed, because of purple—every hue 
may also be produced by mixtures of two or more differ- 
ent light waves; and what is the more surprising, grays 
may be produced by mixing two or more light waves, 
which singly would produce a color. These facts may 
be illustrated readily by mixing light waves, but to do  
-P-A-G-E-170
  154 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
so we must be sure that we are mixing light waves and 
not something else, such as dyes or other pigments. 
The most convenient way to “mix” light waves is to 
place sectors of colored paper in a color wheel which, 
when rotated at high speed, gives roughly the same effect 
that separate light waves would have if they came from 
identical positions in space at the same time. Mixing 
paints is not the same as mixing light waves and different 
results may be obtained.

the striped section indicates gray of the same shade (brightness) 
as the mottled sector of red. If this disc is rotated rapidly, the 
center will be a vivid or saturated red which becomes less so until at 
the circumference the sensation will be gray, i.c., unsaturated. The 
whole dise will be of the same shade or brightness, 
Color Blends.—If we place in the color mixer a sector 
which alone gives a red sensation and another which gives 
yellow and spin the wheel rapidly, the resulting color is 
orange the exact hue of which will depend on the propor- 
tions of the two color sectors. According to subjective 
analysis orange was judged to be a blend of yellow and 
red and was placed between them on the color circle. . 
Mixing yellow with green gives an intermediate hue, 
yellow-green; mixing green and blue, gives a green-blue 
and mixing blue and red, will give, depending on the
-P-A-G-E-171
  SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 155 
proportion of each, indigo, violet or purple. In these 
samples the mixing of stimuli which singly gave pri- 
mary colors, such as red and yellow, give a sensation 
which is a blend. Similarly, the mixing of two color 
stimuli, one from either side of a primary, such as orange 
and yellow-green, gives the primary color yellow which 
lies between them. Thus all around the color circle, mix- 
ing two adjacent colors gives the intermediate hue. 
Strictly speaking, colors are not mixed in these experi- 
ments. Colors are sensations; they exist only in the sub- 
ject’s consciousness. What are mixed are the external 
stimuli, namely, the light waves thrown off by the sec- 
tors. The experiments illustrate, not the fusion of sen- 
sations in the mind but the way in which different 
combinations of stimuli produce the same effect as a 
single stimulus. 
Color Complements.—Mixing wave lengths somewhat 
further apart than those which yield the blend will fre- 
1s Bhs quently result in col- 
ors that are rather 
dingy and lifeless, 
lacking the saturation 
of either of the single 
colors. If just the 
right two waves are 
selected, for example, 
a certain blue and yel-

a blend; indeed, it is

orange and a certain blue-green; violet and a certain 
yellow-green. The modified color circle in Figure 28 
indicates other pairs of stimuli; which when mixed pro- 
duce sensation of colorless gray. Pairs of light waves 
which when acting together produce a colorless gray, 
are said to be complementary. For convenience in 
expression, the colors corresponding to the two comple- 
mentary light waves are often called complementary 
colors or complements. 
The exceptions to the rule that two complementary 
light waves when mixed produce gray are certain greens 
which include the primary green—a vivid grass green. 
To get gray, the light waves for these greens must be 
mixed with those which produce purple. But purple, as 
stated above, cannot be produced by a single wave, only 
by mixing two, the long waves which give red and the 
short waves which yield violet. Thus a mixture of three 
is required to give gray when one is the wave for certain 
hues of green. 
Positive After-sensations.—There are other peculiari- 
ties in the relations of visual stimuli and the conscious 
responses, of which the phenomenon of after-sensations 
isone. Arrange in a dark room on a dark surface a piece 
of paper upon which the rays from a desk lamp may be 
turned. After a few minutes in the dark, switch on the 
light and gaze steadily at the paper for several seconds. 
Then switch off the light. If the eyes are now held 
steadily, the sensation of white will persist for a moment. 
The sensation continues after the stimulus is removed. 
This phenomenon is called the “positive after-sensation.” 
Negative After-sensation—I{ the eyes were held 
steadily after switching off the light, the positive after- 
sensation gives way very soon to what appears like a 
very dark patch, the shape of the paper, on a field of
-P-A-G-E-173
SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 
  157 
lighter gray. This appearance is called the “negative 
after-sensation.” It may be observed by fixating Figure 
29 for 20 seconds and looking away to a gray wall. It 
may be obtained also from 
colors. Fixating yellow re- 
sults in a negative after- 
sensation of blue; blue 
gives an after-sensation of 
yellow, red gives a blue- 
green and so on; every color 
stimulus results in not only 
the sensation and the posi- 
tive after-sensation but a 
negative after-sensation. 
The negative after-sensa- 
tions, it will be observed, 
are of the hue of the com-

plementary colors. 
Adaptation.—The negative after-sensation, or what is 
really equivalent to.it, occurs during continued exposure 
of the eye to any light, constituting what is called 
adaptation to the stimulus. When one comes out of a 
dark room after experiments on after-sensations, the day- 
light is at first dazzling but by degrees one becomes 
adapted to it; the sensations become less white and more 
gray. If one returns now to the dark room at first the | 
sensations are deep black but after a time they are less 
black and more like dark gray. Similarly in gazing con- 
tinuously at a color, we become adapted; and adaptation 
results in a hue sensation of less fullness or saturation. 
This is most clearly illustrated in wearing colored glasses; 
as time goes on, we become less sensitive to the color of 
the glass so that thipgs seen through it are more natural. 
If you suddenly jerk off a pair of yellow glasses after 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  "158 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
having worn them for a time, you will notice that many 
things appear with a bluish tinge. If you look at a blue 
object, it appears more vividly blue than usual, just 
as when you come out of a dark room, white or gray 
objects look more white than usual. Adaptation then 
consists in gradually getting less full or vivid sensations 
from a light stimulus continuously active and in increas- 
ing the sensitivity to the complementary stimulus. By 
exposure to light waves for blue, we secure a great sensi- 
tivity to yellow. and secure more vivid sensations of yel- 
low. Yellow is the complement of blue and it is also 
the negative after-sensation. These three phenomena 
are apparently related and to them may be added a 
fourth, contrast. 
Contrast.—Take two pieces of identical gray paper, 
and place one on the center of a sheet of black and the 
other on white. The piece on the black ground will 
now appear lighter than the one on the white ground. 
Now place one of the identical grays on a blue ground 
and the other on red. Cover both with thin white tissue 
paper—since obscuring the breaks between the colors 
makes the contrast effect more pronounced—and the 
gray on blue becomes tinged with yellow, the one on red 
with blue green, the complementary colors. Placing a 
small piece of red in the center of a sheet of blue green 
results in an.accentuation of the redness. The comple- 
mentary or contrast effects will not appear always, in 
fact, in ordinary life they are little noticed. Conditions 
must be just right; lines of division must not be too 
sharp and reflection of light from one to the other must 
be avoided. For example, a woman who wished to em- 
phasize the bloom of her cheeks would not surround her 
face with a blue-green hat of extendiyg brim. The result 
would be a pallor, since some of the blue-green light
-P-A-G-E-175
  
SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 159 
reflected by the hat to the face would be reflected again 
from the face to the eye along with the red from the 
cheeks. Red and blue-green lights, coming from the 
same surface, are antagonistic and tend toward gray. If

which appear at the intersections of the white strips. (From M. 
Luckiesh, Visual Illusions, New York: D. van Nostrand Co.) 
the face appeared, however, on a background of green, 
especially at a distance, the contrast effect would result 
in an accentuation of the pink from the skin. 
Chemical Processes the Immediate Visual Stimuli. 
—The relations between the objective stimuli, the light 
waves and the conscious reactions, the sensations, are 
rather complex as we have been. Such facts as adapta- 
tion, contrast effects, after-sensations, etc., are appar- 
ently due to chemical activities in the retina in which the 
receptors are imbedded. 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
160 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Theories to Account for the Réle of the Receptors in 
Vision.—The precise nature of chemical activities in the 
receptors and surrounding retina, following stimulation 
by light waves, have never been directly observed. They 
are subjects of speculation entirely. Any hypothesis to 
be acceptable must take into account and explain all of 
the facts of vision. It is not generally conceded that 
any one of the several theories suggested explains satis- 
factorily all of the facts now fairly well established. 
Since many particular facts, upon which such hypotheses 
must be verified are still obscure, no theory can be very 
thoroughly tested at present. The hypothesis favored 
by a number of psychologists as best fitting the most 
facts known at present, was devised by Christine Ladd- 
Franklin and is usually known as the Ladd-Franklin 
Genetic Theory. 
The Ladd-Franklin Theory.—The Ladd-Franklin the- 
ory starts with the assumption that color vision, analo- 
gous to other types of human behavior, evolved gradually 
from more primitive vision. From the primitive eye 
like those of some animals could be secured only sensa- 
tions of black, white and gray. The theory supposes that 
there exists in the receptors a chemical substance which 
when subjected to light of any kind arouses sensations of 
gray and white. It is assumed that in the primitive eye 
only this substance existed. In the course of evolution, 
this “mother” substance in the cones (one type of re- 
ceptor in the retina) became differentiated into two com- 
ponent substances. By means of stimulation of one 
of these components, sensations of blue are produced 
while stimulation of the other results in yellow. At a 
later stage of evolution, the yellow component became 
differentiated into two components, stimulation of one 
resulting in red, of the other in green.

SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 161 
Let us now, while reviewing some of the facts of 
vision, see how the Ladd-Franklin theory explains them. 
Six primary visual sensations were found introspectively; 
namely, white, black, red, yellow, green and blue. All 
of these appear in the theory. The theory affords plaus- 
ible explanation of the relative frequency of Red-Green 
color blindness; the stage of vision being more recent 
it is more likely to fail to appear in particular persons) 
The totally color blind—who is very rare—has only 
the primitive visual substances. The facts of comple- 
mentary colors are also accounted for. When the com- 
plementary blue and yellow lights enter the eye at once, 
both of the component substances derived from gray are 
activated. To arouse both components of gray is to 
arouse gray itself, which is exactly what happens. For 
the same reason, when red and green stimuli simultane- 
ously enter the eye, the result should be a yellow sensa- 
tion since red and green are the components of yellow. 
This is true to the facts. Blue is now required to miix 
with yellow to produce gray, therefore the complement 
of red must be a mixture of both green and blue, that is, 
green-blue, and the complement of green must be a 
blue-red, that is, a purple. These were exactly the facts 
mentioned above under color-mixing. By providing as 
the immediate stimulus for vision certain rather complex 
chemical activities, a basis for explaining after-sensations 
is provided since the chemical activities may persist after 
the removal of the external stimulus. The theory, then, 
explains very well many of the known facts of vision.   
Sensations or Hnartne. 
The Auditory Stimuli—tThe auditory stimuli, like the 
visual, are waves; they are often called sound waves as 
the visible waves are called light waves. Sound waves
-P-A-G-E-178
    162 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
are not movements in the ether but in the air. The 
vibration rate of audible (or sound) waves varies from 
about 12 to 50,000 or less. 
Auditory Sensations: Tones and Noise.—Between 
rates of 12 and 50,000 vibrations per second is a con- 
tinuous series of single rates which may affect the ear 
singly or in numberless combinations, just as light waves 
may, singly or in combination, affect the eye. Very 
rarely do we find a single wave acting alone; the stimulus 
is nearly always a combination but it is quite usual for 
one wave to be predominant. A few special instruments, 
notably tuning forks, when constructed with greatest 
care, will give very nearly, if not quite, a single vibration 
rate. The sensation aroused by waves all of the same 
vibration rate is called a pure tone. Unless you have 
heard one of the rare instruments mentioned, you have 
never experienced a pure tone. 
A pure tone varies in two ways: in intensity or loud- 
ness which depends upon the force of the air vibrations 
and in pitch which depends on the particular rate of the 
vibrations. 
Pitch—The tone of a sound is determined by the 
vibration rate of the air wave. In the case of pure or 
single vibration rates, the tone of the sound is the same 
as the pitch; that is, the pitch fully accounts for the 
tone. Pitch varies from the lowest produced by a vibra- 
tion of 12 per second or thereabouts, depending on the 
individual, to the highest, produced by vibrations of 
30,000 to 50,000—there are great differences between the 
highest audible pitch for different persons. Between 
these extremes, the average individual can distinguish 
10,000 to 11,000 different pitches or tones, some more, 
some many less. All musical sounds may be reduced to 
these pure tones. But before considering how familiar
-P-A-G-E-179
SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 163 
sounds are made up of combinations of pure tones, let 
us ask whether all of these tones may be reduced to a 
small number of primary qualities as the pure colors were 
reduced to four color qualities. 
The Primary Tone Qualities.—The task of discerning 
in the thousands of pure tones a number of primary 
qualities from which others may be derived has been 
baffling. There seems to be in the tonal scale no fixed 
points of reference, no clearly distinctive qualities, which 
the intervening tones clearly resemble, comparable to the 
primary colors of the color circle. Tones at intervals of 
an octave—that is, such tones as the several C’s in the 
music scale—have been suggested as primary because 
they. are more alike than the intermediate tones. In 
other systems of music, Chinese for example, the octave, 
however, is not fundamental and the confusion of 
octave notes is not so striking. It must be said, then, 
that primary tone qualities comparable with primary 
color qualities either do not exist or at least have not 
been isolated. 
Because pure tones are so many and _ unclassifiable, 
most of us are not well acquainted with them as indi- 
viduals. Take middle C, a tone produced by a vibration 
rate of about 260, the standard of the keyboard. Most 
people cannot identify it and still fewer could hum it 
without first hearing it. By the age of 5 years the 
average child can recognize and name a number of com- 
mon colors; but as adults we have no such speaking 
acquaintance with particular tones. 
Timbre.—Few tones are pure; most of them, such as 
those produced by musical instruments, are due not ex- 
clusively to wave lengths of a single rate, i.e., to one pure 
tone, but to several in which one predominates. Most 
musical tones, then, are impure due to the presence of   
       
-P-A-G-E-180
    164 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
waves other than those of the predominating tone. 
These additional waves produce the timbre of the note. 
The predominating rate gives the pitch. Thus middle 
C on the piano, violin and cornet have the same pitch 
due to the predominance of one vibration rate of about 
260 but they have different timbres due to differences in 
the supplementary vibrations. As the mixture becomes 
very complex, we call the sound noise, but even the 
noises commonly experienced have a pitch, which means 
that they have some vibration rate more or less pre- 
dominant. If you scratch the cover of this book slowly, 
then more and more quickly, you will get noises increas- 
ing in pitch. If you strike at once a large number of 
piano keys at one end, then at the other, both give noise 
of different pitch. Noises merge with tones; home made 
xylophones, steam whistles and some “jazz bands” are 
midway between the two. 
The Composition of the Timbre of Musical Instru- 
ments.—The sound waves produced by each of the 
favorite musical instruments, at least most of those found 
in the western world, are many but they are mainly 
related to each other in a simple way. Usually the in- 
strument gives one tone predominating in various de- 
grees called the fundamental, and others, the overtones, 
whose vibration rates are simple multiples of the rate of 
the fundamental. The overtones, in other words, are 
pure tones one or more octaves above the fundamental. 
The flute, for example, gives one of the simplest com- 
binations of the musical instruments; a strong funda- 
mental, and relatively faint overtones of the first, second, 
and sometimes very dimly, higher octaves. Waves from 
the piano are very complex, having, compared to most 
instruments, a relatively weak fundamental, and some- 
times as many as 42 overtones, which vary greatly in ‘
-P-A-G-E-181
  SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 1657 
intensity. Well trained musicians are able to single out 
some of these overtones and hear them singly; but most 
of us hear merely fundamentals differing in quality or 
timbre. In sounds produced by musical instruments, the 
“quality”—-strictly speaking, the timbre—is due to the 
number, kind and intensity of the overtones. An instru- 
ment like the violin will produce at any pitch a number 
of different overtone combinations. It is in this produc- 
tion of appropriate timbre that the master’s touch differs 
from that of the novice. - 
Comparison of Auditory and Visual Sensations.—A 
comparison of auditory and visual sensations reveals both 
similarities and differences. (Saturated colors correspond 
to pure tones; the merging of’pure colors ayith gray re- 
sembles the merging of pure tones with ni The num- 
ber of discriminable sensations among safzfrated colors is 
small compared to the number of discernible pure tones. 
Pure colors and pure tones are both unusual; the pre- 
dominating stimulus is usually mixed with others. 
Saturated colors, unlike pure tones, may be reduced to a 
small number of elements which, properly mixed, yield 
all others as blends. As a consequence, results of color 
stimuli applied simultaneously to the eye are different 
from the results of mixing sound waves. Red and yellow 
stimuli give a single sensation, orange, in which resem- 
blance to both red and yellow appear. Two sound waves 
similarly mixed yield not a single sensation which is 
intermediate and a thing unto itself, but a blend of an- 
other sort in which both tones appear and may be dis- 
tinguished as such. They harmonize rather than blend. 
The facts of complementary color stimuli, in which two 
stimuli combined produce an entirely different sensation 
from either alone, has no exact equivalent in hearing. 
Some sounds will not blend. They conflict and produce
-P-A-G-E-182
  166 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
a throbbing or rasping effect but they never neutralize 
each other. In general, a particular sound stimulus pro- 
duces its particular sensation more invariably than do 
particular light waves produce theirs. Different sounds 
may harmonize or conflict but they never so completely 
lose their individuality as do colors. There are positive 
after-sensations, that is, the continuation of the sensation 
after the stimulus has been removed but for such a brief 
period that it can barely be detected.\, There is nothing 
is sound comparable to the negative after-sensations in 
vision. Adaptation is not found in hearing as it is found 
in vision, taste and smell. One can learn to disregard 
sounds such as the ticking of the clock or the roar of the ~ 
street, but this is an acquired habit and not a phenomenon 
of the sense organ. In vision, it is usually assumed that 
some subtle chemical activities in the retina account for 
adaptation and after-sensations, but in hearing no such 
chemical reactions are assumed to intervene between ex- 
ternal stimulus and the arousal of nerve impulses in the 
receptors. The receptors are presumably aroused by 
mechanical stimulation, but exactly how is as yet 
unknown. 
SENSATIONS FROM THE SKIN. 
Many distinguishable sensations may be aroused by 
stimulating the skin in various ways, such as by touching 
lightly or heavily with tufts of cotton, blunt or sharp 
instruments, metals of various temperatures, by rubbing 
the surface lightly or heavily with rough, smooth or sharp 
objects, scratching, piercing, tickling, by applying elec- 
tric currents, acids and chemicals, ete. Such stimuli 
result in many sensations for which we have names— 
tingling, itching, tickle, burning, scalding, impressions of 
roughness, moistness, stickiness and others. Introspective
-P-A-G-E-183
  SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 167 
study has shown most of these experiences to be com- 
pounds of a small number of elementary sensation- 
qualities. 
The primary sensation-qualities almost universally ac- 
cepted are four: coolness, warmth, pain and pressure. 
Some authorities believe that touch and tickle, which 
would be included above under pressure, are distinctive 
and elementary. According to these investigators the 
qualities from the skin, then, are six: coolness, warmth, 
pain, pressure, touch and tickle. According to the six 
quality classifications, pressure refers to a somewhat 
_ vague sensation aroused when an object is placed on or 
against the skin. Compared to touch, as when the skin 
is lightly touched with a dull pencil point, pressure is 
felt as more dull and deep. Tickle is aroused by drawing 
a light bristle across the back of the hand, especially if 
contacts are made with hairs. 
Since the several receptors are scattered fairly gen- 
erously over the skin—but by no means uniformly— 
many objects or conditions may arouse several of them at 
once. Pulling a piece of plaster stuck on the skin arouses 
various pressure receptors, possibly warm or cold and 
pain, especially if a hair is pulled slightly. Moistness is 
due to the combined stimulation of pressure and cold. 
Itch is due to a combination of touch, tickle and mild 
pain; certain stinging sensations combine touch, pain and 
warmth; in a sharp sting pain predominates. Many 
“skin sensations” then are compound sensations. 
Pressure, warmth, and cold show adaptation effects, 
but pain does not. One may become quite insen- 
sitive in a brief time to warmth and cold, to pressure, 
as of clothes, or to odors, but not to pain. One may, of 
course, neglect a pain, but when one turns attention to it, 
the sensation is still there. When odors or colors have 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  168 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
become weak through adaptation, they cannot be greatly 
increased in this way. Severe pains seem to become no 
less severe as they continue. On the whole, this per- 
sistent call for action is to the advantage of the organism 
since pain usually is a symptom of harmful influences. 
SENSATIONS FROM THE MuscLEs. 
The muscles are supplied with receptors that are nor- 
mally aroused by movements and pressures. The liga- 
ments and joint surfaces also have receptors that are 
stimulated by muscular activities. Compounds of sensa- 
tions aroused by stimulation of these receptors constitute 
the “muscle sense.” They are usually called kinesthetic 
sensations, which means literally sensations depending 
upon movement. Under usual circumstances these sen- 
sations are rather vague. They are, however, of great 
importance since upon these sense organs muscular ac- 
tivity largely depends. Destruction of them would tre- 
mendously disturb writing, speech, and management of 
the body generally. Combined with pressure on the skin, 
the muscle sense makes possible the judgment of weight 
as in hefting an object. Muscle sensations from the eye 
are of great importance in the judgment of the distance, 
size and shape of objects seen. 
SENSATIONS FROM THE ORGANS OF EQuILIBRIUM. 
Closely related in function to the sense organs in the 
muscles are those in the organs of equilibrium adjoining 
the inner ear. They are stimulated by movements of a 
liquid which follow any movement of the head. What 
one senses is bodily movement, as when one is turned on 
-a piano stool, is lifted or lowered in an elevator or is 
moved in a train. These sense organs are essential to the 
maintenance of bodily equilibrium in all bodily move-
-P-A-G-E-185
  
SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 169 
ments as in standing in a train, sitting on a merry-go- 
round and in walking, stooping, or jumping. / Excessive 
stimulation as in spinning on a piano stool or sailing on 
rough water brings out the sensations more clearly and 
results in after-sensations which may be readily observed. 
The elementary qualities are like those of sensed bodily 
movements. When extreme these sensations constitute a 
complex called giddiness or dizziness. 
SENSATIONS FROM ‘THE INNER ORGANS OF THE Bopy: 
Orcanic SENSATIONS. 
Hunger, thirst, nausea, faintness, feverishness, fullness, 
heartburn, headache, stomach-ache, back-ache, palpita- 
tions, shivers, and pains—griping, cutting, burning, 
shgoting, throbbing—are but samples from a long list of 
sensations aroused by mechanical, thermal and chemical 
stimuli of sense organs in the body. | The anatomy of the 
internal receptors is not very far advanced nor is the 
introspective analysis of the organic sensation-qualities. 
Introspective study is hampered by the difficult and in 
most instances total impossibility of applying experi- 
mentally the stimuli as they occur under natural condi- 
tions. The experimenter cannot produce a shooting pain 
in the chest or feverishness of the sort or at the time 
wanted. Introspective study has revealed the qualities 
of pressure, warmth, coolness and pain, at least. Some 
investigators believe that all of the complex organic sen- 
sations experienced contain no qualities other than these. 
The differences perceived are believed to be due to the 
character of the combinations of these qualities, the in- 
tensities of each in the combinations, the number and 
location of the receptors aroused and the temporal order ~ 
of the stimuli. The total effects may differ greatly be- 
cause of the differences other than those in sensation-
-P-A-G-E-186
  170 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
qualities. Other investigators believe that there are at 
least several genuinely different pain-qualities; some add 
ache as irreducible to pain and some add other unique 
organic qualities. Only future research will disclose the 
facts. ‘ 
The inadequacy of the analysis of organic qualities is 
regrettable not only because a better understanding would 
be important in applied science, especially in medical 
diagnosis, but also because it would greatly increase the 
possibilities of comprehending human behavior in gen- 
eral. Were our knowledge more adequate, the task of 
interpreting the nature of feelings, emotions, impulses, 
and desires; of explaining the acquisition of skills; of 
diagnosing the bases of temperament, mood and person- 
ality would be less difficult and speculative. a 
Summary CoNCERNING SENSATIONS. 
Sensations are conscious reactions which arise when 
certain stimuli affect the sense organ in such a way as to 
arouse a nerve impulse. Only the conscious reactions 
aroused in this way are called sensations. Study of sen- 
sations has been directed to the identification and analysis 
of the qualities of the reactions and the correlation of 
the response with the stimulus. In some instances, nota- 
bly in vision, a given sensation-quality may be produced 
by several different external stimuli; in others, notably 
‘in hearing, the given reaction is normally produced by 
only one kind of stimulus. The phenomena of adapta- 
tion, contrast effects, positive and negative after-sensa- 
tions reveal other peculiarities of the relations of external 
stimuli to conscious reactions. i 
In some instances, the many distinguishable sensations 
produced by the stimulation of a given type of sense 
organ have been reduced by introspective study to a
-P-A-G-E-187
  SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 171 
small number of primary or elementary sensation-quali- 
ties; in other instances such analysis has been less suc- 
cessful. The analyses of tastes into four qualities, sweet, 
sour, salt and bitter; of visual sensation into six qualities, 
red, yellow, green, blue, black and white, are probably 
the most satisfactory. Sounds have been studied exten- 
sively but it has not been found possible to reduce them 
to a small number of sensation-qualities comparable to 
the color-qualities. Sensations from the skin were once 
accepted as reducible to four qualities, warmth, coolness, 
pain and pressure, but recent work indicates that pressure 
should, perhaps, be subdivided into pressure, touch and 
tickle. Kinesthetic sensations aroused by movements 
have been usually attributed to pressure alone or coupled 
with dull pain; sensations resulting from stimulation of 
the organs of equilibrium have qualities similar to the 
pressure of kinesthetic sensations. It is recognized that 
the muscle sense merits further study. The organic sen- 
.sations especially have been incompletely investigated 
mainly because of the intrinsic difficulties encountered. 
The elementary qualities found are at least pressure, 
pain, warm and cold, but possibly there are several kinds 
of pressure-like and pain-like qualities. 
FEELINGS. 
It is now apparent that many experiences commonly 
called “feelings” are really simple sensation-qualities or 
blends of such qualities. To “feel” cold, hot, hungry or 
tired or to “feel” a pain, a cramp and many other internal 
conditions is to experience sensations singly or in complex 
combinations. (F eeling, then, in popular usage refers to 
many conscious experiences that are really sensations.) 
In psychology, however, the term has been reserved to 
apply to certain conscious processes that have been held
-P-A-G-E-188
  172 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
to differ from sensations. In its technical usage the term 
feeling refers to conscious processes that are to be sharply 
distinguished from sensations. 
>Wundt’s Six Feelings.—That there are certain con- 
scious experiences with qualities radically unlike those 
of sensations has been held, by some investigators at least, 
since the first years of systematic work in introspective 
psychology. William Wundt, often termed the “Father” 
of modern psychology, proposed six different feelings, all 
of which he considered to be elementary, irreducible 
qualities different from the qualities of any known sen- 
sations. The six feelings were: strain, relaxation, excite- 
ment, calm, pleasantness and unpleasantness. The 
tendency, since the time of Wundt’s pioneer work, has 
been to reduce the number of elementary feelings. If is 
now quite universally agreed that strain, relaxation, ex- 
citement and calm are really complex blends of organic 
and kinesthetic sensations just as hunger and fatigue are. 
The only experiences now defended as elementary quali- 
ties different from sensation-qualities are pleasantness 
and unpleasantness. There are, moreover, about as many 
who believe that these experiences are blends of organic 
sensations as of those who believe they are distinctive. 
We shall consider briefly both sides of the issue, but first 
we must try to indicate what is meant by pleasantness 
and unpleasantness. 
Pleasantness and Unpleasantness Contrasted with 
Certain Sensations.—What are technically defined as 
feelings must be distinguished from certain sensations 
which they may accompany or follow. Unpleasantness is — 
often confused with sensory pain. Pain is a definite type 
of sensation-quality occasioned by the stimulation of a 
particular kind of sense organ. Unpleasantness, although 
it usually accompanies pain, is not identical with it. Pain
-P-A-G-E-189
SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 173 
may be at times pleasant as when a boy gently moves a 
sore tooth. In pathological cases, extreme sensory pain 
seems to be distinctly pleasant although it is still pain. 
Just as unpleasantness usually accompanies pain, it 
usually, but not invariably, accompanies bitter, certain 
odors, pressures, giddiness and other sensory compounds. 
In these instances the unpleasantness is clearly distinct 
from pain. Pleasantness similarly usually accompanies 
other sensory experiences such as sweet, mild, sour or salt, 
many odors, colors, pressures and sounds. Pleasantness 
does not invariably go with these experiences, however. 
When one is satiated, sweet may be unpleasant; when one 
is nauseated, the odor of fruit may:be unpleasant; when 
one is tired, otherwise pleasant voices may be displeasing. 
The feelings, then, while they may accompany any sen- 
sory experience are not identical with any of these here 
mentioned. 
It is difficult to describe the two types of alleged feel- 
ings. One can understand them only by examining the 
conscious experiences which arise when one is aware of 
the pleasantness which usually accompanies a sweet taste 
and the unpleasantness which accompanies a bitter taste 
or the pleasing experience produced by a musical instru- 
ment as contrasted with the unpleasantness produced by 
a noise, or the agreeableness which accompanies flatter- 
ing remarks as compared to the disagreeableness which is 
often a consequence of reproof. 
Physical Basis of Pleasantness and Unpleasantness 
Unknown.—The uncertainty concerning the character 
of pleasantness and unpleasantness is mainly due to the 
fact that the exact physical bases of both are totally 
unknown. We do not know what parts of the brain are 
active nor do we know what neurones in the midbrain or 
cord, if any, are specifically involved. No specific sense 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
174 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
organs of a unique character which, when stimulated, 
result in pleasantness or unpleasantness have ever been 
discovered and no groups of internal receptors of the 
kinds already described are known to be invariably stim- 
ulated during these experiences. Whether the two feel- 
ings, then, are essentially different from organic sensa- 
tions is a problem for introspective study. Concerning 
the physical bases of feelings there is nothing to offer but 
hypotheses designed to harmonize with the findings of 
introspection. / 
The Evidence of Introspection Concerning Pleasant- 
ness and Unpleasantness.—On the first question, namely, 
whether pleasantness and unpleasantness are similar to 
other blends of organic and kinestheti¢ sensations, opin- 
ions differ. The majority of investigators believe there 
is a considerable resemblance; that these feelings, like 
tingling excitement, or mild organic discomfort, may 
reasonably be assumed to be complex blends of organic 
sensations. Some investigators, however, insist that 
pleasantness and unpleasantness are utterly unlike any 
organic sensations and maintain that they are primary 
and irreducible conscious qualities of another order. This 
first point, then, is disputed but on some others better 
agreement has been secured. : 
(1) The feelings are, compared to most sensations, 
very unstable and variable, when studied attentively. 
Attend to a red color and it reaches maximum clearness; 
attend to a toothache and it seems more intense, but 
attend to the feeling of pleasantness or unpleasantness _ 
itself, and it is likely to fade away. This fact may mean, 
however, that the moment you attend to the feeling, the 
stimulus which aroused the feelings has been neglected 
so that the feeling disappears. In other words, it is easier 
to attend to colors or pressures because one can prolong 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 175 
the stimulus. Feelings, like many organic sensations, 
cannot always be aroused or. prolonged when you want 
them. (2) Feelings are not localized in any particular 
place as most tastes, colors, odors, pains, etc., are. They 
are felt as in us some place, but in no particular place. 
Some observers report, however, that their location is 
diffuse but no more diffuse than general malaise or ex- 
citement or organic irritation which are accepted as 
organic sensations. (3) Another significant observation 
is that pleasantness and unpleasantness never appear at 
the same time. One may have neither; he may feel in- 
different but he cannot feel pleasantness and unpleasant- 
ness simultaneously. The two are opposites and mutually 
exclusive. (4) The final fact from introspective study is 
that neither feeling appears by itself but always as an 
accompaniment of some other process, sensation, emo- 
tion, thought. Pleasantness and unpleasantness are 
therefore often spoken of as forming the “feeling-tone” of 
a sensation or the “background” of other experiences. 
Rival hypotheses concerning feelings should take into 
account these four facts from introspective study. 
Most of the particular theories concerning feelings fall 
into two general types as earlier suggested. We shall 
offer one example of each type. 
The Theory That Feelings Depend upon Conditions 
yea the Neurones.—Those writers who favor the view that 
feelings are not blends of sensations but unique conscious® 
experiences usually explain them in terms of some con- 
dition in the neurones which are called into action» It 
is assumed that activity of the neurones when they are 
in one kind of condition results in pleasantness, and when 
in another kind of condition, in unpleasantness. Since 
the inner conditions cannot be of two kinds at once,/the 
feeling is certain to be one or the other unless the con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  176 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
dition is midway, when the “feeling-tone” presumably 
would be indifferent. Since the inner conditions of the 
neurones concerned in some response, such as tasting 
food, could change, according to the theory, it would be 
possible to account for the reaction being tinged with 
pleasantness on one occasion and indifference or un- 
pleasantness on another. The feeling as thus explained 
may require no special sense organs or brain areas since 
they are due to the action of any cortical neurones; any 
sensation, perception, emotion or idea may be tinged with 
pleasantness or its opposite. The theory, therefore, har- 
monizes very well with the facts concerning the feelings 
adduced from introspective study. 
The main difficulty with the theory is that the nature 
of the “conditions of the neurones” is unknown and not 
easy to imagine. Some writers have associated pleasant- 
ness with easy and free running brain action, while un- 
pleasantness goes with slow, impeded action. This notion 
is clearly erroneous inasmuch as unpleasant responses, as 
to a sting or piercing sound, are exceptionally quick. 
Other writers suggest that well-nourished brain cells 
produce pleasantness when called into action whereas 
poorly-nourished cells when forced to act produce un- 
pleasantness. There is no reason for believing, however, 
that the cells concerned in producing sensations of pain 
or bitter are less well nourished than those concerned in 
sweet or blue. Other suggestions have been made but 
most of them are too vague to permit the application of 
a test. The theory as a whole should not be discarded, 
however, because the physical nature of the neural con- 
ditions underlying pleasantness and unpleasantness is 
unknown. It may at any time be discovered. 
Theory That Feelings Are Blends of Organic Sensa- 
tions—To account for the several facts concerning
-P-A-G-E-193
SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 177 
pleasantness and unpleasantness which introspective 
study has revealed, the writers who uphold the opinion 
that these two feelings are blends of sensations must 
assume that each is the result of a particular organic 
change set up by some stimulus. According to this theory, 
the stimulus, say a complex sound wave, produces not 
only a sensation of noise but also a certain complex 
organic change in the body. This organic change now 
arouses the receptors in the organs concerned and the 
nerve impulses thus actuated, on reaching the brain, 
arouse a complex of sensations. This blend of sensa- 
tions is the feeling. It is the combination of organic 
sensations aroused indirectly by a cycle of stimuli and 
responses. The feeling must necessarily lag behind the 
sensation but probably by an almost or quite impercep- 
tible time. The theory, furthermore, assumes two com- 
binations of organic changes which are antagonistic and 
mutually exclusive. One group of changes produces the 
blend of sensations termed pleasantness; the other, un- 
pleasantness. A sweet taste usually is immediately fol- 
lowed by inner changes of the first sort, a bitter taste by 
changes of the second sort. The thought of a friendly 
act arouses the changes which result in pleasantness 
while the thought of a harsh rebuke arouses the un- 
pleasant type. According to this type of theory, both 
pleasantness and unpleasantness are blends of sensation- 
qualities. 
This is a very attractive theory and one which seems 
to be gaining in favor. The difficulty with the hypothesis 
is that the existence of two mutually exclusive types of 
organic changes which go with pleasantness and unpleas- 
antness exactly and exclusively have not been discovered. 
Although the specific organic reactions underlying the 
two feelings are unknown this fact does not constitute 
   
-P-A-G-E-194
    
178 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
disproof of the general theory. Our knowledge of inner 
responses is meagre. 
The Function of Pleasantness and Unpleasantness.— 
While the physical basis of the processes is unknown, 
pleasantness and unpleasantness are nearly universally 
recognized as among the fundamental native reactions of 
the organism. Many experiences are accompanied by 
pleasantness, others by unpleasantness, because of our 
original nature. As William James writes: “Why does 
a hen, for example, submit herself to the tedium of 
incubating such a fearfully uninteresting set of objects 
as anestful of eggs? Why do men always lie down, when 
they can, on soft beds rather than hard floors? Why do 
\\they sit round the stove on a cold day? Why do they 
prefer saddle of mutton and champagne to hard-tack 
and ditch water? Why does a maiden interest the youth 
so that everything about her seems more important and 
significant than anything else in the world? Nothing 
more can be said than that these are human ways and 
that every creature likes his own ways.” 
In general, those experiences which are accompanied 
by pleasantness are beneficial for the organism; those 
which produce unpleasantness are harmful. There will 
be many particular exceptions; our native organization 
is not equipped to meet perfectly all the situations of 
varied lives. Much is left to learning and our native 
tendeneies to be satisfied and annoyed are greatly modi- 
fied by experience. Some things originally distasteful 
we learn to like; other things natively pleasant we learn 
to dislike. But to many situations we instinctively react 
in one way or the other and the majority of cases the 
pleasant reactions are biologically serviceable. In this 
fact lies the function of the feelings. 
Pleasantness and unpleasantness are correlated each {
-P-A-G-E-195
  
  SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS 179. 
with a fundamental attitude of the organism. Pleasant- 
ness goes with the positive attitude of acceptance, 
acquiescence or following up; unpleasantness goes with 
the negative attitude of recoil, rejecting or avoidance. The 
situation which arouses pleasantness is the one which we 
remain with and perhaps deal with further; the situation 
which produces unpleasantness we seek to avoid or 
escape. Pleasantness is a conscious state which stands as 
a sign of situations to approach and react to further, 
unpleasantness stands as a sign of situations with which 
to have no further dealing unless to avoid or remove them. 
The two feelings, then, are intimately linked up with two 
fundamental forms of bodily adjustment, positive and 
negative. As such they play a significant réle in reactions 
in general and in the process of habit formation as we 
shall see later in detail.

CHAPTER VII 
THE EMOTIONS 
  The discussion of sensations, especially the organié 
sensations and the feelings, completed in the preceding 
chapter, paves the way for a treatment of emotions. 
Such experiences as thirst, dizziness, fullness, faintness, 
nausea, feverishness, widespread discomfort and the 
like are found to be complex blends of organic, kinesthetic 
and skin sensations. These sensations are aroused ‘by 
various mechanical, chemical and thermal stimuli affect- 
ing receptors in the body or on its surface. In some 
instances, as, perhaps, in hunger, the area of stimulation 
is small; in others, as in fever, the area is widespread. 
The body is well supplied with sense organs and sensory 
nerves by means of which the inner changes or reactions 
of the body may be sensed. That is to say: sensations 
may be aroused by the organism’s own activities; we may 
sense our reactions as well as the stimuli which arouse 
them. The feelings, pleasantness and unpleasantness, are 
according to one theory, complex blends of sensations 
aroused by some type of inner changes. The emotions, 
according to a famous theory, the James-Lange Theory, 
are also compounds of sensations produced by profound 
changes in the body. 
Tue Jamus-LaAnce THrory or Emotions. 
By emotions we mean such experiences as love, hate, 
fear, jealousy, joy, anger, sorrow. Emotions we recognize

as subjective, as due to conditions in us. According to 
observations first reported, simultaneously by William 
James and Carl Lange, more than thirty years ago, the 
emotions are produced by an extensive group of changes 
in the body, in blodd vessels, intestinal muscles, in glands, 
in fact, in nearly all of the bodily mechanisms.\ The 
inner changes which underlie the emotions are severe 
enough to stimulate innumerable sense organs in the 
skin, in the inner linings of the body, in the walls of blood 
vessels, in the muscles and other organs. This widespread 
stimulation resu}tsy in a veritable flood of sensations due 
to the torrent of nerve impulses flowing in from all parts 
of the body. , This. complex of sensations, according to 
James and Lange, is the emotion, This view is now, 
known as the James-Lange Theory of Emotions. 
Emotions Contrasted with Other Blends of Sensa- 
tions.—Note that emotion, as a psychological term, refers 
to the state of consciousness; that is, to the complex of 
sensations and not to the bodily activities themselves. 
Almost every stimulus to which we react mentally arouses 
skeletal and inner responses to some degree, although the 
organic reverberation may be very slight in many cases. 
If to a subject comfortably seated, slight odors, tastes, 
tactual stimuli, or meaningful words are presented, very 
delicate instruments will record slight changes in respira- 
tion, blood pressure, glandular activities and the tonus of 
skeletal muscles. But these bodily changes are often too 
slight to become vividly conscious; the subject is un- 
aware or barely aware of their existence. Only those 
bodily changes which are rather: vividly felt are called 
emotions. 
“The term emotion, however, is not applied to the feel- 
ing of relatively simple or readily localized activities such 
as hunger, thirst, the burning or gnawing of indigestion,

‘nausea,!suffocation, or palpitation of the heart; nor do we 
speak of a single type of bodily sensation, however diffuse, 
such as general muscular fatigue, fever, or chills as an 
emotion, although the*latter are approximations. No, 
the genuine emotions, such as fear and rage, are much 
more diffuse, mixed, unanalyzable groups of sensations 
than any of these,4They represent changes which per- 
vade the whole body, and among them the smooth muscle 
and glandular changes which are controlled by the 
autonomic nervous system are most conspicuous. In 
fact, unless an experience posesses a considerable organic 
reverberation—strained or irregular breathing, palpita- 
tions of the heart, flushings and palings, quivers, sinking 
feelings in the stomach, tensions of the arteries, and other 
changes especially in the viscera—we do not speak of 
the mental state as an emotion at all. /The sensations 
found in emotions come from changes in sense organs, 
and skeletal muscles as well as the internal changes, 
however, and with these outward visible “expressions” 
we shall deal first.” 
Tue Outwarp “Expressions” oF THE Emotion. 
We recognize general bodily postures that are char- 
acteristic of certain emotions: we speak of being rigid 
with fear, bent with grief, or puffed up with pride. The 
expressions of the emotions appear more uniformly in 
patterns of response of the facial muscles. That many 
of them have an instinctive basis is suggested. by the fact 
that they are, so far as may be observed, universal and 
fairly constant reactions. If the reader will observe the 
plates (Figure 50, Chapter XIII) he will be able to 
identify most of the emotions “expressed,” although the 
face is unfamiliar, and much, such as color and move- 
ment, is lacking.

L The emotional expressions may serve the purpose of 
influencing the behavior of other organisms. The display 
of teeth, and other angry expressions along with hissing, 
growling, barking, etc., may be conceived as instinctive 
forms of “bluffing” which may frighten off smaller or less 
courageous opponents. ] Note the transformation in size 
and ferociousness of appearance of a cat when menaced 
by a strange dog. Similarly the human expressions of 
derision, scorn, disgust may modify the acts of others. 
Smiling, or a “sad expression,” although the origin is 
obscure, invite kindly and sympathetic behavior. The 
erect, puffed-up attitude of pride may beget admiration 
or submission. 
The wide-open eyes in wonder or surprise are an ad- 
justment which provides a wide range of vision.~) The 
narrowed eyes in anger are a kind of visual concentration 
on the object of attack, while the puckering of brow and 
closing of lids serve to protect these vital organs from 
injury. The slowing of breathing, in the first stages of 
fear, provides for more adequate hearmg. Sniffing and 
pricking up of the ears in animals are sensory adjust- 
ments to slight stimulation. [Much of the expression of 
an emotion, then, is the result of sensory adjustments.j 
ZGritting and display of the teeth in anger among ani- 
mals are motor adjustments for attack.> Humans, under 
primitive conditions, may have used their teeth as 
weapons; the tenseness of muscles about the jaw is a 
result probably of these adjustments. The widened nos- 
trils in fear or anger permit more effective breathing; 
clenching the fists and other muscular tensions have 
obvious utility. The bristling of hair about the neck and | 
other preparatory reactions of animals belong here too. 
The turning aside and wry face in disgust probably orig- 
inated in the infant’s response to undesired food or to

noxious odors. The expressions under emotion, then, are 
in part the results of adjustments for motor a to 
the exciting object. 
The outward expressions of the emotions, depending 
mainly on the patterns of response among the skeletal 
muscles, large and small, show an almost unlimited 
variety. Figure 50 (Chapter XIII) gives only a small. 
sampling of the many facial expressions which this one 
subject made. Patterns of general bodily adjustnients 
brought about by different stimuli are also very numerous. 
This fact will appear to, be of considerable importance 
later in attempting to disclose the bases of an alleged 
large number of different emotions. It will be found that 
while the skeletal “expressions” are numerous and dis- 
tinctive the types of visceral responses, depending on the 
smooth muscles and glands, are very few. 
Tuer NERVE sistent OF THE INTERNAL Emoytonan 
CHANGES. - 
The internal changes which seem to provide the major 
portion of the sensations that constitute tHe emotion are 
under the control of the autonomic system. The nerves 
of this system, connected through synapses with motor 
fibres which issue from the spinal cord and brain stem, 
are subject to nerve impulses received from the central 
nervous system. By means of inborn connections, the 
organic activities may be accelerated or retarded by pains, 
noises, odors, or other forms of external stimuli. 
The autonomic system is divided into three groups of 
nerves:

of the cord and mid-brain.

2.. The sacral division, connected with the lower part 
of the cord. 
3. The sympathetic division, connected with the in- 
termediate part of the cord. 
The cranial and sacral divisions, although supplying 
different regions, have a similar function which is always 
antagonistic to the function of the sympathetic. The 
cranial division depresses the activity of the heart, 
whereas the sympathetic stimulates it to greater activity. 
The cranial increases the glandular and muscular activi- 
ties of digestion in the upper, and the sacral in the lower 
part of the intestines, whereas the sympathetic diminishes 
these activities in both regions. In general, if the cranial 
or sacral division accelerates, the sympathetic depresses; 
if the former inhibits, the latter stimulates; that is, they 
are antagonistic. 
Since the divisions of the autonomic bring about dif- 
ferent internal reactions, the emotional states which go 
with them must be distinctive. This, in fact, is the case; 
the sympathetic is involved in the strong emotions. of 
which fear and anger are the best examples; the cranial 
and part of the sacral division go with %nild, pleasant 
states, such as general bodily comfort and pleasure; while 
part of the sacral is concerned in lust and sex excitement. 
The sympathetic system, although tremendously com- 
plex, embracing nerves discharging into nearly all of the 
smooth muscle and glandular mechanisms, acts very much 
as a unit. The innervations may be slight or profound 
but in either case the effects are widespread. The cranial 
and sacral divisions do not act invariably as units; they 
permit of specific innervations of the different bodily 
organs.

tions.—Marked changes in-the digestive and assimilative

functions are brought about by innervations of the sym- 
pathetic system which occur in fear and anger. If a cat 
which has been fed a meal of gruel containing bismuth, a 
, substance opaque to x-rays, is placed before the screen 
of a fluoroscope, the normal rhythmic, churning move- #* 
ments of the stomach may be clearly observed. If the 
eat is angered by a barking dog, these movements may be 
greatly diminished; in fact, they often cease altogether. 
Even in milder vexation, such as that produced by tying 
a small stick to the cat’s leg, the stomach movements may 
be inhibited. The glandular activities of digestion are 
similarly diminished. In a typical experiment on an 
angered dog, instead of the usual 65 or 70 cubic centi- 
meters of gastric juice, an amount less than 9 cubic 
centimeters (and this of poor quality) was secreted. 
Thus the whole digestive process is side-tracked. 
What purpose could all of this serve? None is very 
apparent save this—the elimination of the work of diges- 
tion liberates a good deal of energy that may be otherwise 
utilized: That such energy is conserved for strenuous 
muscular action is probable. 
With anger or fear go also pronounced circulatory 
changes due to sympathetic discharge. The heart beats 
more rapidly and with greater amplitude. The arteries 
of the abdomen are constricted, thus driving large 
amounts of blood to other parts of the body, mainly to . 
the skin, skeletal muscles, brain, and lungs. The con- 
riction of arteries, together with increased heart action, 
produces a higher blood pressure and more effective 
circulation through the organs involved in bodily action. 
The lungs are stimulated to greater activity; breathing 
becomes deeper and more rapid. Sweat breaks out on 
the skin, making an early start toward the elimination 
of heat from the body engaged in strenuous exertion.  
-P-A-G-E-206
  190 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
The sympathetic fibres also activate the adrenal glands 
whose secretion, adrenalin, poured into the rapidly cir- 
culating blood promptly reaches the various bodily organs 
and profoundly affects many of them. tom 
Like the impulses.of the sympathetic system, adrenalin 
diminishes the glandular and muscular activities of diges- 
tion, constricts the abdominal arteries, and stimulates the 
heart and lungs. It increases and prolongs the more 
prompt effects of the sympathetic nerves and produces 
several additional changes. Reaching the lungs, adrenalin 
causes a dilation of small smooth muscles, which permits 
more ready ventilation, and thus provides for a more 
speedy assimilation of oxygen and discharge of the 
products of fatigue. Adrenalin has a specific effect on 
skeletal muscles, greatly creasing their sensitivity to 
nerve impulses, which results in greater strength and en- 
durance. Adrenalin causes the liver to pour into the 
blood more rapidly its store of blood sugar, the fuel which 
is burned in muscular work; it also causes the liver to 
secrete a substance which makes blood clot more ‘rapidly 
on reaching the air, thus reducing the flow in case of 
an injury. % : 
Tue Emercency THrory oF THE EMOTIONS. . 
Other organic changes, characteristic of fear and anger, 
could be mentioned; but this, at least, is already apparent 
—the body is adjusted during ‘such emotions to provide ! 
for the greatest muscular strength and enduraice. On 
the basis of this fact, an American physiologist, W. B. 
Cannon, has framed what he calls The Emergency Theory 
of the Emotions. The sympathetic system is conceived 
as an elaborate check and drive méchanism that is thrown 
into gear by events which demand immediate and ener- 
getic action; that is, by emergencies. Under primitive
-P-A-G-E-207
  THE EMOTIONS 191 
conditions, loud or sudden sounds, the perception of 
wild beasts, unfamiliar men, obstinate obstructions, and 
other objects or conditions which arouse fear or anger, 
represent situations in which physical strength and en- 
durance, 4S in the fight or flight, may enable the organism 
to survive. It matters relatively little that digestion is 
inhibited, the heart or lungs overworked, if the animal 
successfully meets the emergency. 
The organic responses, then, are preparatory reactions 
—elaborate mobilizations for violent .and prolonged 
physical action. The emotions of fear and anger, as 
conscious states, are, in the main, the sensations occa- 
sioned by these inner changes. 
GENERAL Types or EMOTIONS. 
The sympathetic system, it was said, is antagonistic to 
the functions of the cranial and sacral autonomic. Inner- 
vations of the latter tend in general to promote the quiet, 
normal organic processes of digestion, assimilation and 
excretion—the quiet service of building up bodily re- 
sources. Stimulation of certain nerves of the cranial 
division increases the flow of saliva and gastric secretions, 
dilates the blood vessels of the viscera and promotes the 
action and tone of the stomach and alimentary canal. 
Other nerves of this division slow the heart, thus resting 
the cardiac muscles. Certain nerves of the sacral division 
are concerned with the proper regulation of the bladder 
and the lower alimentary canal. 
Innervation of the visceral organs by the cranial and 
sacral nerves tends to arouse quiet, pleasurable emotional 
states for which we have but few names. A comfortable 
state of “well-being” is about all there is to it at times; 
and the mild emotions of mirth, of pleasure in hearing 
music, of joy in one’s work, in agreeable conversation,
-P-A-G-E-208
192 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
comradeship or surrounding, harmonize with the upbuild- 
ing internal services of the body. These we shall call the 
mild joyful emotions. Under such mild but joyful mental 
states we are best fitted for most of the tasks of daily 
life. ee 
A portion of the sacral division of the autonomic sys- 
tem is concerned with stimulation of the sex functions. 
Such stimulation activates a number of muscular and 
glandular functions, in various degrees of intensity, which 
result in a complex of vivid sensations. These sensations 
are the primary factors in certain experiences of an emo- 
.tion-like character that we shall call the sex emotion. 
The Three Types of Emotions.—Three general types 
of inner responses have been found. Each furnishes in 
all probability the fundamental basis of an emotional| 
experience. The three types are: 
1. The strong, “emergency emotions,’ depending on 
the discharge of the sympathetic division of the 
autonomic system. Since the sympathetic divi- 
sions act as a whole, such emotions must be 
organically much alike. They may, however, 
differ in degree from very slight to very great 
. intensity. 
2. The mild, joyful, upbuilding emotions, depending 
on the activity of the sacral and cranial division 
of the autonomic nervous system. The sensa- 
tions thus provided are usually mild and incon- 
spicuous. Since they arise from the normal 
healthful bodily functions they are .often nh 
thought of as emotions at all. We shall refer 
them, however, as the mildly joyful emotions. 
3. The sex emotions, including lust, depending on cer- 
tain activities of the sacral system. Presumably 
there are several types of sex sensation-complexes, 
Some of them vary in degree from slight to great 
intensity.
-P-A-G-E-209
ae ee NTT en 
THE EMOTIONS 193 
Aside, then, from the sex emotions and the mild, pleas- 
urable states of well-being which go with the action of 
nerves in the cranial and sacral autonomic, all other 
genuine emotions, so far as is known, result from inner- 
vations of the sympathetic system. 
Subdivisions of the “Emergency” Emotions.—We are. 
at present unable to give subdivisions of either the mild 
pleasurable emotions or the sex emotions. The emotions 
which are known to go with sympathetic action may, 
however, be listed in several groups. Since we shall be 
mainly concerned with these, a fourfold classification is 
presented. 
1. Kage, and other similar states, such as rage, fury, 
vexation, irritation, revenge, and perhaps jeal- 
ousy and scorn. 
2. Fear, and similar states, such as dread, anxiety, 
worry, melancholy, terror and perhaps grief and 
regret. 
3. Excitement, shock, uneasiness, nervousness, em-. 
barrassment. ¢ 
4, Extreme pity, sympathy, elation, enthusiasm. 
Anger and Fear.—It is assumed that the several states: 
which are classified with anger, 7.e., rage, vexation, etc., 
are more like each other than they are like fear or any ~ 
of the states similar to fear. It is not assumed, however, 
that the experiences in the anger-like group are wholly 
unlike those in the fear-like group. What, then, are the 
precise similarities and differences? 
All of those inner changes brought about by the action. 
of the sympathetic system are to the best of our knowl- 
edge essentially the same except for differences in inten- 
sity or degree. The sympathetic system acts as a whole 
and it acts essentially in the same way in anger, vexation,. 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  194 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
jealousy, fear, or anxiety except that there is more inten- 
sity in some states than in others. Since the inner 
changes in smooth muscles and glands are the basis of a 
very conspicuous part of the complex of sensations which 
makes up an emotion, all such emotional experiences 
have much in common. Introspectively, this seems to be 
the case. The fundamental feature of all these strong 
emotions is the flood of sensations—a sort of excitement 
and turmoil—from the smooth muscles and glands. 
Most people, however, find the experience of “being 
afraid” very different from “being angry” or “being ex- 
cited.” Upon what do these differences depend? Being 
“afraid” or “angry” or “excited” are very complex ex- 
periences which include components other than the sen- 
sations from functions controlled by the sympathetic 
system. They include, in the first place, a certain pattern 
of response of the skeletal musculature. Each has its 
particular facial expression and its specific arrangement 
of muscular tensions, inhibitions and relaxations in the 
hand, arms, trunk, legs, feet. Note the differences in all 
of these external muscular patterns in men in fear, anger, 
grief, etc. Each such pattern of motor response arouses 
a particular complex of sensations; each “feels” different 
from the other. In part, then, the observed differences 
between anger, anxiety, fear and the others are due to the 
variations in the patterns of adjustment of the skeletal 
muscles. This, however, is not the only difference. 
The percepts of the exciting objects differ greatly in 
_the several experiences. In fear, it is perhaps a wild 
animal; in anger, an annoying intruder; in excitement, a 
eritical audience that is perceived and thought about. 
The percepts and realizations of these situations; the 
related memories, anticipations, apprehensions and other 
ideas tend to fuse with the internal and muscular sensa-
-P-A-G-E-211
  
THE EMOTIONS 195 
tions. As was pointed out often in preceding sections, 
fusions of different mental states is the rule; only careful 
introspective analysis enables us to disentangle them. To 
these percepts and ideas must_be added impulses.. And 
the impulses experienced in different emotional experi- 
ences are very unlike. In fear are felt strong impulses to 
escape; in anger, impulses to attack or injure in some 
way. These urges are usually vivid during emotional 
crises and they contribute greatly to differentiating the 
experiences of “being afraid,” from “being angry,” ete. 
These impulses are not, strictly speaking, parts of the 
emotion. They are components of the total experience 
at the time but really not a part of the emotion itself. 
The organic turmoil which is the main component of 
the emotion, then, is essentially the same in all strong 
emotions except lust. The skeletal musculature, sensa- 
tions from which form a component of the genuine emo- 
tion, takes different patterns in various emotions. Fused 
with these are non-emotional experiences, namely, the 
percepts, judgments, apprehensions, ideas of all sorts and 
the urgent impulses which differ greatly in various’ emo- 
tional experiences. Care must be exercised, therefore, to 
indicate clearly which of the several components of the 
emotional experience one has in mind during discussion. 
Shock and Excitement.—Violent. inner shock (which 
is due to very intense sympathetic innervation) or excite- 
ment represents the sheer organic changes very well, since 
the impulses are often vague and uncertain. Excitement 
thus resembles both fear and anger organically, but dif- 
fers from both because of the indefiniteness of the im- 
pulsion. For example, a sound heard by a primitive man 
prowling in the woods might have aroused the sympa- 
thetic activities, experienced as excitement or uneasy 
alertness, until the source is more clearly perceived. If
-P-A-G-E-212
196 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
the stimulating object is found to be a ferocious beast, 
the percept with the impulse to run, added to the organic 
and muscular adjustment, constitutes the whole experi- 
ence of fear; if the stimulus proves to be an old enemy, 
that percept plus the impulse and a muscular arousal to 
fight gives us the state of anger. The inner changes 
themselves, devoid of percepts, ideas, impulses and mus- 
cular adjustments, are felt as various degrees of 
inner turmoil ranging from terrific shock to slight 
excitement. 
Exciting Joy, Enthusiasm, Etc.—The violent or excit- 
ing states of mirth, joy, pity, zeal, enthusiasm, and the 
like are included in the list of emotions which depend 
upon the activity of the sympathetic system. Suppose, 
for example, that you are quietly enjoying a concert. .If 
the music becomes very stirring, you may experience a 
glow, a pang in the breast, a fullness of breathing, a flut- 
ter of the heart, a shudder or darting chills, a sinking 
sensation in the region of the stomach—evidence of the 
discharge through the sympathetic. Joy, on other occa- 
sions; may become so violent as to produce weeping, la- 
bored breathing, high blood pressure, and digestive dis- 
turbances, Enthusiasm, especially in people of the emo- 
tional or excitable type, may become so exciting as to 
make quiet work or thought impossible. Thus, in the 
intense, exciting, or violent form, joy, enthusiasm, pity, 
and others belong in the sympathetic group. 
Other Alleged Emotions Are Mental and Motor 
Attitudes.—In addition to the intense emotions of the 
exciting type, the sex emotions and the mildly pleasant 
states which accompany the organic and visceral proc- 
esses of the normal and upbuilding types, the language 
abounds with names of conscious states which common 
usage treats as emotions—wonder, timidity, gratitude,

admiration, suspicion, coyness, pride, hope. How are 
they to be explained? 
The traditional explanation is that these states are 
compounds or fusions of elementary emotions, fear, anger 
and others, in much the same way that most complex 
movements are new, acquired organizations of elementary 
motor acts, or that a novel perfume is a new fusion of 
elementary odors. This type of reasoning by analogy is 
intelligible enough but the facts of the operation of the 
autonomic system are against it, and, the writer believes, 
the facts of introspection are also against it. Since the 
two divisions of the autonomic system are antagonistic, 
they cannot both operate at the same time. Fusions of 
certain emotional conditions are thus at once eliminated. 
The sympathetic system, the indispensable basis of nearly 
all vivid or exciting emotions (except lust), operates 
primarily as a whole; it is not subject to differential 
action, to functioning in various patterns of parts. The 
theory of acquired emotional complexes, based on anal- 
ogy, can scarcely maintain itself in the face of- such 
antagonistic facts. ¥ 
How, then, are these mental states to be explained? 
Most of them should probably not be considered emo- 
tions at all; at least, not emotions in the same category 
with anger, fear and the others above described. They 
are mental states embracing impulses, sensations from 
facial and postural reactions, varying ideas, feelings of 
pleasantness or unpleasantness more or less pronounced, 
and other data, relevant or irrelevant, with which con- 
sciousness is usually fringed. To illustrate: timidity em- 
braces distinctive impulses of a submissive character, the 
sensations from a characteristic pattern of facial and 
bodily muscles, certain intellectual ideas and apprehen- 
sions, and the like. In this mild form, the inner turmoil,
-P-A-G-E-214
    198 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
characteristic of emotion, is in abeyance. Timidity may 
be called an attitude of mind, or objectively viewed an 
attitude of behavior, but not a full-fledged emotion. Let 
the object or person producing the attitude of timidity 
in an observer now appear more dangerous, and timidity 
may give way to fear, as the impulse to escape couples 
with a welling of disturbances within the body. Timidity, 
an attitude, may thus merge with fear, an emotion. In- 
deed, timidity as an attitude may be accompanied by the 
typical excitement of sympathetic action, but in such a 
case we should distinguish the two in scientific thinking 
as we distinguish odors from real taste in the flavor of a 
food. Similarly, hope, pride, suspicion and the others are 
mainly attitudes of mind, typified by characteristic im- 
pulses, ideas and facial and bodily postures, feelings of 
pleasantness or unpleasantness, but not necessarily in- 
volving the inner conditions which are the indispensable 
characteristics of genuine emotions. Only when the 
internal, visceral disturbances are found do we have a full 
genuine emotion; often in hope, wonder, etc., this com- 
ponent is nearly or quite indistinct. 
Although the visceral components of the emotional 
experience do not combine into various new patterns, 
some other elements may. In all likelihood the facial 
and bodily musculature may form many new patterns. 
Thus one may acquire an “expression” which is partly 
like fear and partly like amazement, or a combination of 
mirth and sorrow, etc. It is questionable whether really 
different impulses can be compounded in this way. 
It is possible, however, to shift rapidly from one impulse 
to another. Most of us, for example, after having ob- 
served a dignified gentleman fall in the snow or be other- 
wise humiliated, feel a curious alternation of the impulse 
to laugh and the impulse to feel and express regret. One
-P-A-G-E-215
    
THE EMOTIONS 199 
urge may give way to the other so rapidly that it seems 
that both are experienced simultaneously. It is unlikely 
that they do fuse, however. The way in which we sud- 
denly “explode” with mirth during such experiences 
indicates the sudden giving way of the impulse of pity to 
the impulse of mirth. 
Summary.—The whole emotional experience is ob- 
viously complex. The basal organic changes are of three 
types. Each type is found in many particular emotional 
experiences. Each type appears in varied levels of in- 
tensity but one type will not fuse with others. The 
skeletal muscle components are of many forms and may 
recombine into new patterns. The impulses, which are 
very numerous and different in kind as well as in in- 
tensity, shift rapidly but apparently do not fuse. The 
same is true of the feeling component. It is of two forms, 
pleasantness or unpleasantness, which may alternate but 
do not fuse. Difficult as it may be, it is the task of 
psychology to isolate and describe the characteristics of 
each of these components. In no other way may the 
whole experience be made intelligible. 
Having selected certain fundamental type emotions 
and described some of their constituents, we are now 
ready to consider whether they are native or acquired and 
if native what. situations tend instinctively to produce 
them. Ce 
ARE THE Emotions NATIVE on ACQUIRED? 
Observations of infants soon after birth (by Watson 
and others) have given convincing evidence of the native 
character of significant symptoms of typical emotions. 
Facial expressions, bodily adjustments, changes in breath- 
ing and circulation and other characteristics of fear and 
anger may be evoked almost immediately after birth.
-P-A-G-E-216
  200 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
These symptoms indicate sufficiently the arousal of the 
sympathetic system. In animals, too, the elaborate in- 
ternal changes appear very early. The emotions depend 
on complex patterns of response that are fundamental 
and native.. Evidence of joyful experiences also appear 
very early. They will, therefore, be considered as funda- 
mental and instinctive responses. The jens are 
not obviously present at birth. Indeed, the glandular 
mechanisms essential to the profound sexual emotions 
are not functioning completely until pubescence. That 
the inner adjustments which form the main components 
of. these emotions are acquired is altogether unlikely. 
‘They show a complexity of codrdination that seems in- 
telligible only when conceived—like fear, anger and joy— 
as instinctive. 
Situations Which Instinctively Arouse Fear and 
Anger.—The machinery of the main emotions and the 
coordinated character of its operation in each case are 
native, but what situations instinctively activate these 
remarkably complex reactions? A complete answer to 
this question cannot be given at present. Fear (accord- 
ing to Watson) occurs in infants as a-response to: 
1. Sudden removal of support, as when the hands are 
withdrawn, allowing the infant to drop a few 
inches before being caught. 
2. A sudden push or shake or movement of blankets, 
etc., when the infant is sleepy. 
3. Loud sounds. 
When greater maturity is reached, probably other 
stimuli instinctively arouse fear but the evidence is not 
complete. It is believed (by Thorndike) that at appro- 
priate periods in life each of the following alone, or in at 
least in combination with other factors, arouses fear: 
   
-P-A-G-E-217
THE EMOTIONS 201 
thunder-storms and other loud noises, solitude, darkness, 
being suddenly brushed or clutched, strange persons of 
unfriendly mien, large animals approaching one, reptiles 
and certain vermin. Very young infants betray no in- 
stinctive fear of animals. Whether the fright which 
makes its appearance later is the result of animal stories 
or other experiences or due to the ripening of a delayed 
instinctive tendency is not as yet certain. Essentially 
the same uncertainty prevails concerning some of the 
other sources of fear. 
Anger is a reaction that seems to be instinctively 
aroused by a very large number of stimuli. It was found 
(by Watson) that the infant is angered by almost any 
persistent hampering of his movements, even by “slight 
constraints put upon the head by soft pads.” As the 
child grows older, it seems natively disposed to become 
angry whenever any activity under way—eating, sleep- 
ing, sitting still in thought, walking, etc.—is persistently 
interrupted or interfered with. Being slapped or other- 
wise pained, being shoved or seized, are types of inter- 
ferences that are specially likely to arouse anger from the 
earliest stages of infancy. 
The situations which arouse fear iva anger in the main 
represent emergencies. Under conditions of primitive 
life these emotions were activated instinctively by con- 
ditions in contending with which increased bodily 
strength and endurance would be of great utility. Man- 
kind today possesses the same emotional equipment that 
thousands of years ago helped its ancestors to survive! 
At least, modern biology tells us that the physical, emo- 
tional and mental equipment of people today is almost 
imperceptibly different from that of mankind ten or 
twenty thousand years ago. The emergency theory of 
the emotions gains support both from a consideration 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  202 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
of its survival value in the race and from the study of the 
native responses of infants of today. 
Situations Which Instinctively Arouse Joyful Emo- 
tions.—Joyful emotions of the mildest sort accompany 
the smooth running, undisturbed bodily processes. They 
are the result of sensations produced by such organic 
functioning. They may be heightened in infants by such 
stimuli as feeding when hungry, removing from a hard 
to a soft bed, warming up when cold and by certain 
tickling, shaking, rocking, patting, turning about and 
other forms of attention. Among adults enjoyment re- 
sults from innumerable situations but it has not been 
possible to distinguish the native from the acquired 
sources. 
Laughter, the clearest objective symptom of a joyful 
emotion in most children and adults, has been the subject 
of many volumes of speculation but as yet no satisfactory 
account of the essential factors which produce it at any 
time has been produced. Many native sources of joyful 
emotions remain obscure. This much seems clear, how- 
-ever, perfect operations of the cranial-sacral functions, 
that is, fine digestion, assimilation, etc., result in a strong 
predisposition toward joyfulness and laughter. The child 
well fed, healthy, functioning excellently, laughs and is 
joyful for almost no reason at all. : 
The Sex Emotions.—Some students (e.g., Freud and 
Watson) have concluded that the joyful emotions and the 
sex emotions are really the same. Usually such students 
assume that all forms of joyful emotions are really sexual 
in character. This notion seems to be incorrect. Every- 
day experiences and introspective study will disclose 
unique characteristics of forms of mirth, laughing, joyful- 
ness and bodily exuberance that are unlike lust or any 
form of sex emotion. The sexual functions, moreover,
-P-A-G-E-219
  * 
J THE EMOTIONS , 203 
are controlled by fibres of the autonomic system which 
may act independently of the other fibres of the sacral 
and cranial division. These are sufficient reasons for 
treating the joyful and the sexual as distinct emotions. 
The only way of arousing, instinctively, the sex emo- 
tions is the stimulation of certain erogenous zones. It is 
maintained by some that a specific sex emotion may be 
thus aroused in infancy but this is doubtful. Certainly 
a complete sexual emotion cannot be aroused until pu- 
bescence and, then, most readily, when the organic con- 
dition is favorable. Lust, among adults, may be aroused 
in innumerable ways as may fear, anger, or joy, but by 
situations whose connection with the emotion is acquired. 
How emotions, themselves native and_ instinctively 
aroused by relatively few situations, become attached to 
new stimuli will be disclosed in Chapter XI. 
Of the three general classes of emotions, most is known 
about those which depend on the action of the sympa- 
thetic system. Since these are of great significance in 
* everyday life, some attention will be given to them in 
their relation to motor and mental efficiency, to health 
and to other conditions. 
Some Errscrs or Fear, ANGER AND SruiLar Emotions. 
Fear, anger and the other emotions of this class, con- 
trolled by the sympathetic system, are preparatory re- 
actions in the form of mobilizations of organic and 
visceral resources for the maximum physical exertion. 
Under conditions of primitive life in the jungle, their 
utility in contending with human or animal enemies, 
with storms, floods and natural forces would be apparent. 
In modern life, they may be of service in, similar exi- 
gencies, but ordinarily they begin and end without the 
physical exertion for which they are a preparation. We
-P-A-G-E-220
204 “ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
are often angry but seldom fight; often fearful, without 
flight. 
On Health.—What are the results of emotions, such as 
rage, anxiety or fear, when they are not accompanied or 
followed by physical exertion? Indigestion is one result. 
The angered cat showed stagnation of food in the stomach 
from three to six hours on different occasions. Among 
humans anger, excitement, sorrow, and extreme joy are - 
often followed by more or less severe digestive disturb- 
ances. Loss of appetite and weight under prolonged 
sorrow, anxiety, or worry is often observed. The blood 
sugar liberated by the liver when not utilized as mus- 
cular fuel is partly wasted by excretion through the 
kidneys. The general wear and tear on the heart and 
arteries, the adrenal and other organs which are driven 
to excessive action during the strong emotions, may in 
the long run be injurious. At least, it is widely believed 
that the excitement, worry, fear, anger, and irritations of 
life hasten the breakdown of the visceral functions and it 
is well known that diseases or deficiencies of these func- 
tions are greatly aggravated by emotional disturbances. 
When asked on his 89th birthday for the secret of his 
longevity and vigor, Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus 
of Harvard University, is reported to have said: “My 
experience does not furnish a short, explicit prescription 
of keeping health and working power till eighty-nine. I 
will say, however, one thing seems highly. important— 
keep as calm under all circumstances as your nature 
permits.” 
On Skill, Thought and Ability to Learn.—However 
greatly crude strength may be increased under the strong 
emotions—anger, fear, or excitement—efficiency in acts 
of skill, in judgment and reasoning, and in learning is 
decreased. The excited or angered baseball player |
-P-A-G-E-221
THE EMOTIONS 205 
  fumbles the ball. The frightened youth forgets his 
“piece.” An inventory of the experiences of skilled 
musicians disclosed an almost universal conviction that 
any exciting emotion aroused by the audience, or even 
an emotion normally aroused by the music itself, is 
detrimental to proficiency. Even in boxing, where 
strength assuredly counts, it is well known that skill is 
disrupted by rage. In golf, tennis, and other sports re- 
quiring great precision, the disastrous effects of anger, 
chagrin, nervousness, and anxiety are patent. 
Thinking, reasoning, judgment are, like skill, disturbed 
by the strong emotions. In melancholy, ordinary tasks 
or debts look herculean. Frightened by a cry of “Fire!” 
the audience falls into an irrational panic; the drowning 
man strangles the swimmer who attempts to rescue him. 
Even for murder, the leniency of the jury is generally 
assured if the act was committed in a passion. Violent 
emotions represent, in effect, internal preparations for 
violent acts, and often the less intense grief, fear, vexa- 
tion, or excitement may lead to thoughts, words, or acts 
that seem unwarranted or ridiculous in calmer moments. 
In laboratory studies, although violent emotions are 
‘seldom secured, the general tendency of the milder ones 
to disturb acts of thought or skill appears clearly. Such 
tasks as tracing the outline of a pattern which is ob- 
served only by reflection from a mirror (mirror-drawing) 
or performing a difficult feat in mental arithmetic are 
retarded and sometimes disrupted by vexation, anger, 
chagrin, anxiety, or even by too exciting enthusiasm. It 
is characteristic of the novice to be subject to frequent 
emotional upsets. As the learning progresses, greater 
poise is achieved. Generally speaking, the highly effi- 
cient performance is characterized by a quiet alertnes: 
and unemotional zeal rather than by excitement or emo- * 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
    206 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
tional enthusiasm. There are, however, many mental 
and motor functions such as writing, simple arithmetic, 
etc., so well habituated as to withstand very considerable 
emotional disturbances. 
On Stimulating Activity——The notion that the strong 
emotions in the routine of life render a tremendous 
service by providing impulsion to greater accomplish- 
ment, that they represent the release of hidden springs 
of energy, is likely to be very misleading. That they do. 
provide a temporary increase in muscular strength we 
have seen, but this is attained at no small cost nor can 
it be long maintained. The athlete may run his quarter 
mile better if excited (although many prefer to be calm), 
but if he is “on edge” too long before the race, he may be 
half exhausted before it begins. The depleting effects of 
a public performance by the uninitiated, of a frightful or 
grievous experience, are familiar to all. “What,” asks 
David Belasco, “would be the condition of a player who, . 
every night for even one week, should really feel all of 
the emotions of Hamlet or Othello or Lear; of Queen 
Margaret or Lady Macbeth or Juliet?” 
But is the strong emotion not of great utility as an 
occasional upheaval to arouse us out of complacency to 
fresh resolution and determination, to set the ball rolling? 
If a student feels he is losing his interest in his studies— 
going stale—would not the part of wisdom be to arouse 
somehow in himself profound disgust, or anger at his 
lethargy, or vivid excitement by anticipation of the re- 
wards of greater achievement? It would seem so; and 
perhaps the answer would be affirmative if there were no 
better ways. The physician often faces a similar situa- 
tion. The patient reports bodily sluggishness and loss 
of grip. While pills or stimulants may be prescribed, the 
physician knows they are but temporary expedients which
-P-A-G-E-223
THE EMOTIONS 207 
  work no permanent cure. The remedy lies not in drugs 
but in better hygiene; better habits of eating, sleeping, 
work and play. The remedy for mental inertia is not in 
emotional stimulation but in improved habits of mental 
hygiene. A strong emotion, acting like a drug (for adren- 
alin and other glandular secretions are drugs), has the 
habit-forming effects of such artificial stimulation. If 
we rely upon coffee to keep us awake, shortly coffee is 
required in increasing doses. If we rely this week on 
emotional outbursts to get us at our tasks we shall the 
more surely require them the next. The emotional up- 
heaval is like a drug, strictly an emergency measure, to 
be used only as a last resort, and then advisedly. 
Must One Experience an Emotion in Order to Act It? 
—Admitting that the strong emotions are not essential 
but usually detrimental to the achievements of modern 
life, are they not essential to certain tasks, such as plead- 
ing in court, preaching, and other public performances? 
Could one make a stirring address or, what would seem 
to be more difficult, could one portray an emotion with- 
out really experiencing it himself? The testimony of 
great actors and actresses should furnish an answer to 
this question. 
Many years ago, William James collected the state- 
ments of a number of leading actors and actresses and 
found a division of opinion. Many of the greatest were 
able to portray perfectly the outward appearance of emo- 
tions in face, posture, gait, and voice without the visceral 
and organie accompaniments on which the emotion chiefly 
depends. Others believed they were unable to affect the 
dissociation so completely. The few cases, however (if 
they are correct observations), are enough to show 
that the inner turmoil is not essential to successful 
dramatization. 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
208 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
    David Belasco, the eminent theatrical producer, has a 
decided opinion on the matter. “To assert that any 
actor must or even can really feel, when acting, all that 
he represents—assuming, of course, that he is represent- 
ing any vital or even vivid emotional experience—is 
merely to maintain what is manifestly nonsensical. In 
acting, there never can be, in the very nature of things, 
any real feeling. . . . Nowhere are complete self-control, 
dominion, poise more absolutely essential to success than 
they are in acting and they cannot exist where sensi- 
bility ‘is permitted to hold sway.” i 
Mr. Belasco cites a number of anecdotes in support of 
his belief that great actors, even in playing profoundly 
emotional réles, really maintain perfect self-control. For 
example: “One night when playing Othello in America, 
Salvini, as he spoke the final words, ‘no way but this, 
killing myself to die upon a kiss,’ and collapsed in his 
appalling simulation of death, murmured to Miss Viola 
Allen, the player of Desdemona: ‘For the one hundred 
and third and last time this season!’ ” 
The Need of Control of the Emotions.—While it is 
possible, as actors and actresses testify, to portray the 
facial, bodily, and vocal features of an emotion without 
the inner turmoil, the more frequent modification in 
every-day life is the elimination of the outer expression, 
while the internal disturbances hold sway. We experi- 
ence anger, fear, or sympathy without obvious motor 
response. Indeed, the emotions may come to be highly 
satisfying, as in the case of the few who greedily study 
the daily paper for fresh incentives to grieve idly at the’ 
world’s sufferings, rage at its vices, and exult at its 
achievements without contributing in any way to the 
relief of suffering, to the abolition of vice, or to the in- 
crease of achievement. The emotions might be defended
-P-A-G-E-225
  
  THE EMOTIONS 209 
on the ground that they are intensely satisfying, that they 
add to the color and variety of life and break up the drab 
monotony of routine. It would be a sorry world for most 
of us were there no indignation, exaltation, or excitement; 
even fear, anger, and grief—under certain circumstances 
—are satisfying. If we can experience these emotions 
with little likelihood of serious consequences, as we may 
enjoy fear in a storm-tossed ship if assured of safety, or 
anger and grief from scenes on the stage or screen, it is 
undeniably pleasant, as our willingness to pay substantial 
prices for these experiences amply attests: What is 
needed, of course, is temperance and wise control. The 
main dangers lie in the possibilities of permitting emo- 
tional enjoyment to become debauchery or a substitute 
for action. Not only are worthy impulses and. attitudes 
with less internal turmoil more desirable from the stand- 
point of personal efficiency and health, but the world is 
better served by acts of relieving suffering, and resisting 
Gapresion than by reactions which begin aie end wholly 
in one’s breast. 
GENERAL EMOTIONALITY. 
Individuals differ in their general emotional responsive- 
ness. At the one extreme are the calm, stolid, imper- 
turbable individuals; at the other the excitable, sensitive 
and easily aroused; and from one extreme to ‘the other 
we pass through degrees of emotionality insensibly 
minute. 
The concept of general ening is not unlike the 
concept of general athletic ability, general strength, or 
general mental ability. Two people at approximately the 
same stage of emotionality are not necessarily identical, 
but are like two people of about the same general athletic    
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  210 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
ability, who are alike only on the average, while different, 
more or less, in each of many particular forms of athletic 
prowess. Averaging up the emotional reactions to many 
situations, we arrive at a rough central tendency and it 
is to this that the term general emotionality refers. The 
cases of great general emotional susceptibility, or of great 
emotional lethargy, need not represent a particular lack 
or deficiency in one’s equipment nor some added defect, 
native or acquired, but merely the extremes of a group 
of tendencies possessed by all. 
~ Emotional Excess.—An excess of emotionality is the 
main characteristic of one extreme. All or nearly all | 
emotion may be excited by stimuli, numerous and slight, 
more than is the case with average people; joy, fear, 
sorrow, melancholy, and excitement are easily and fre- 
quently aroused. Not only are emotions easily and often 
aroused, but they are usually intense; joy is for them 
often explosive and riotous, anger becomes violent rage, 
sorrow becomes intense grief. 
While there are individuals predominantly sorrowful, 
or mirthful, or easily angered or affrighted, the more 
typical case is the individual who is susceptible to all or 
nearly all forms of emotional response. As a general 
rule, the child readily susceptible to one form of emotion 
is readily susceptible to others. The child who laughs 
the heartiest, most readily breaks into tears; adults 
capable of the most enraptured pleasure are susceptible 
to the deepest sorrow or the most exquisite pain. The 
most readily enraged may be, in turn, the most com- 
passionate; the most ferocious, the most fearful. The 
sympathetic system, in all of these cases, seems to be 
hypersensitive and hyperactive; easily thrown into gear 
and unusually intense in its response to stimuli of many 
sorts.
-P-A-G-E-227
  THE EMOTIONS 211 
Emotional Instability—Generally, but not invariably, 
extreme emotional sensitivity is characterized not only 
by emotional excess but also by emotional instability. 
The emotional child often shifts abruptly from laughter 
to tears, from affection to anger, from self-confidence to 
pessimism. In this fickleness, the emotional sensitivity 
and excessiveness of response can usually be recognized, 
despite the fact that other types of instability, more 
mental than emotional in character, making up what is 
called the “psychopathic” or the “neurotic” constitution, 
are frequently found in the same individual. Indeed, 
excessive emotionality and nervous and mental instabil- 
ity are often difficult to distinguish. Of the latter, some- 
thing will be said in the next chapter. 
The extremely unemotional individual is less easy to 
detect and his behavior is a less serious matter with the 
exception of the infrequent cases caused by actual dis- 
ease. The least emotional individuals are by no means 
unemotignal, but are aroused less frequently and less 
intensely. The mechanism of the emotions, designed for 
emergencies, is rather easily aroused even in those rela- 
tively unresponsive. It is the over-emotional rather 
than the under-emotional who experience difficulties in 
adaptation to modern conditions. 
In the emotional child the sympathetic nervous. sys- 
tem, it would appear, is readily innervated, bringing 
about the train of visceral changes previously described. 
How serious these disturbances may be depends, of 
course, upon the soundness of the organs themselves; 
but indigestion and intestinal disorders, disturbances of 
circulation and of heart action, nervousness, insomnia, 
general weakness, and fatigability are frequently found. 
With the internal activities of the body more fully at 
the mercy of the external conditions, more than ordinary  
-P-A-G-E-228
  212 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
care and prudence must be exercised to avoid overtaxa- 
tion of reserves. The emotionally unstable child usually 
cannot indefinitely keep pace with those of greater poise 
but otherwise of equal endowment. 
Handicaps Produced by General Emotionality.—In 
the work of the school, the handicap of excessive emo- 
tionality usually becomes apparent. Pupils of high 
mental abilities who are otherwise sound, except that 
they are very emotional, experience difficulties in holding 
themselves down to continuous, especially monotonous, 
work. Drill in spelling, arithmetic, phonics, and writing 
is carried on sporadically.. In the formal aspects of 
these subjects, the emotional child lags behind his intel- 
lectual possibilities. He lacks the capacity for steadiness 
and persistence of concentration which such functions 
demand. His attention flags and shifts before the lesson 
is well under way. Special interests, more individual 
attention, shorter periods of practice with frequent 
change, an abundance of physical freedom, and other 
special forms of treatment frequently enable the emo- 
tional child to make greater achievements. 
In the work of adult life, excessive-emotionality is a 
handicap in a similar way. Tedious and monotonous 
work is trying and may be unusually fatiguing. Fast, 
exciting, exacting or dangerous tasks also exhaust the 
bodily reserves more rapidly than in less emotional 
natures. Special occasions or exigencies—examinations, 
disappointments, misfortunes—are abnormally disrupting 
and require more rest for recuperation. In sum, exces- 
sive sensitivity of the sympathetic system is a handicap 
demanding special management and hygiene as much as 
deficiencies of the lungs or muscles or heart.

QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. One of the main issues raised in the text is the question as to 
whether there are many different emotions, as some have 
asserted, or only a few real emotions, as the author state’, other 
so-called emotions being really complex states of mind in which 
the genuinely emotional component may or may not be present. 
Attempt introspectively to test these opposing views. During 
a period of several days, record introspective accounts of fears, 
angers, shocks, excitement, etc., experienced attempting to dis- 
tinguish between the percepts, ideas, impulses, muscular atti- 
tudes and inner excitement. Which of these vary the most? 
2. Observe an infant or a child who is experiencing some emotion. 
Describe the facial and bodily movements, and other “expres- 
sions.” In what respects are they preparatory reactions, and 
how do they affect the behavior of others? 
3. Can you offer any evidence in favor of the statement that grief, 
melancholy, anger, or fear are sometimes satisfying? 
4, Is it wise to give way to an emotion when you feel the impulse? 
5. How often does the average adult experience fear under the 
conditions of modern life? List some of the situations which 
provoke fear. Do the same with anger. 
6. Can you think of situations, under modern conditions, wherein ~ 
a strong emotion would be of utility? 
7. What are some of the impulses which you have experienced 
when angry or frightened? 
8. Were there cases in which the impulses changed while the emo- 
tion remained the same? Can you cite cases in which the 
emotion changed while the impulse remained the same? 
9. Give samples of “irrational” fears, angers, melancholias, etc. 
10. What emotions, chiefly, arise when you are physically tired, 
tired by mental work, hungry, or in states of illness, indiges- 
tion, uncertainty? 
11. What people are, as a rule, more emotional; successful or unsuc- 
cessful, intelligent or dull, educated or uneducated? Who have

anger, for observation at a time.) Grade the intensity of the 
emotion from 1 (very mild) through 3 (average) to 5 (very 
intense). Record the situation which provoked it; the time of 
day; the physical condition at the time, 7.e., fatigue, hunger, 
etc.; the mental condition, i.e., cheerful, worried, etc., the length 
of time the-.emotion lasted; its main characteristics as intro- 
spectively or retrospectively determined; the impulses accom- 
panying it, 7.e., what you felt like doing. At the end of the 
week summarize the data and compare with others in the class.

among college women, will be found in G. 8. Gates’ forthcoming

CHAPTER VIII 
THE DOMINANT HUMAN URGES 
We have now considered several types of significant 
reactions, namely, muscular reactions, sensations, feel- 
ings and emotions. Most of the reactions previously 
considered are influenced in some degree by types of 
urges or craving which are active at times. Whether 
sensations or other experiences are pleasant or unpleasant 
depends upon the nature of the cravings then in force. 
Under the impulse to secure rest, to be permitted to 
rest is pleasant, to be forced to remain active is unpleas- 
ant; during the craving for food, to eat is satisfying, to 
remain hungry is annoying. In the chapter on emotions 
we found that the organic conditions which underlie these 
conscious experiences are closely linked with impulses; 
indeed, the internal changes may be considered to be 
an inner preparation to assist in putting the impulses 
into effect. Anger, to illustrate, usually goes with an 
impulse to do damage and the visceral changes which 
underlie the emotions are preparation for vigorous action. 
In the chapter on instinctive motor reactions we found 
that man inherits relatively few ready-made skills of a 
complex sort but a vast assortment of elementary and 
loosely organized muscular responses out of which in- 
numerable coédrdinated acts are built up through learn- 
ing. From the earliest days of life the child begins to 
strive to acquire habits, some of which are so complex 
as to require years in the making. Why form such skills? 
Behind the habits that men form, behind all the activi-

ties and strivings which result in the acquisition of 
habits and skills, we may find impulses, urges or crav- 
ings of some sort. To these dynamic factors in human 
conduct the present chapter will be devoted. . It will deal 
with the factors which initiate and sustain and variously 
condition human action. 
The human organism, even in infancy, is decidedly 
active and its activity usually appears to be not alto- 
gether random and purposeless but directed toward some 
end. Our problems are: What are these ends that are 
sought? What are the sources of the seeking? What 
are the forces that give human activity, everywhere and 
so far as we know, at all times, a certain typically 
human character? Are the directions which human 
strivings take wholly the results of reasoned choice or 
intelligent determination or do some or all of them 
result from urges that are blind or obscure? Even if 
we are able to foresee or if, at least, we attempt to fore- 
see, the immediate consequences of our daily endeavors, 
may it not be that unsuspected cravings, native or ac- 
quired, are the subtle determining forces? These are 
some of the questions we must seek to answer. 
THrortns CoNCERNING HuMAN Sprincs or ACTION 
At the very outset it must be admitted that the facts 
concerning the springs of human action have by no means 
been wholly disclosed. Uncertainty abounds; and as a 
consequence, differences in opinion prevail. Two ex- 
treme positions will indicate the range within which 
various views may be found. 
Freud’s View: A Single Motive Force “Libido.”— 
According to one view, that of Freud, founder of the 
certain school of “Psycho-Analysis,” there exists in man- 
kind but one craving or motive force which plays any 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
218 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
considerable réle in guiding conduct and in initiating 
activity. This is a craving of a sexual character termed 
“libido.” At the bottom of nearly everything that man 
does, feels, thinks or dreams is the subtle operation of 
this elemental urge. The popularity that has been 
achieved by this view bears testimony both of the possi- 
bility that a strong urge may influence action in a sur- 
prisingly widespread way and of the difficulty that may 
be expected in isolating the irreducible or primary human 
urges. 
James’ View: Innumerable Impulses.—In contrast 
with the view of Freud is the older view of James, still 
maintained by some students, that instead of one or a few 
urges, man is born with innumerable impulses which are 
the main sources of action. He states that “every in- 
stinct is an impulse” and that “man has a far greater 
variety of such impulses than any lower animal.” By 
an instinct he means “the faculty of-acting in such a 
way as to produce certain ends,—without previous edu- 
cation in the performance.” “Instincts,” James adds, 
“are implanted for the sake of giving rise to habits.” 
Since “many instincts ripen at a certain age and then. 
fade away in all pedagogy the great thing is to strike 
while the iron is hot, and to seize the wave of the pupil’s 
interest in each successive subject before the ebb has. 
come, so that knowledge may be got and a habit of skill 
acquired. If a boy grows up alone at the age of games 
and sports, and learns neither to play ball, nor row nor 
sail, nor ride, nor skate, nor fish, nor shoot, probably he 
will be sedentary to the end of his days; and, though 
the best of opportunities be afforded him for learning 
these things later, it is a hundred to one bet he will pass 
them by and shrink back from the effort of taking those 
necessary first steps the prospects of which at an earlier 
 
-P-A-G-E-235

age would have filled him with delight. In each of us 
a saturation-point is reached in all these things”; and 
we “live on what we learned when our interest was fresh 
and instinctive.” 
According to James, instead of one and only one im- 
pulse holding.sway from the beginning to the end of life, 
we experience innumerable instinctive urges, each for 
a time, long or short. These native impulses are the 
mainsprings of action, the dominant motives in habit 
formation. Some of the native impulses are supple- 
mented by habit formation and thus become permanent 
possessions, ever serving to initiate some form of action, 
others like impulses to hunt, if given no exercise at the 
time they are active, may gradually die of disuse. But, 
presumably, the genesis of action is to be sought in the 
instincts which comprise an “enormous number of special 
adjustments (which) animals—possess ready-made in 
anticipation of the outer things among which (they) 
. are to dwell.” 
Both Views Probably Extreme.—Neither of these ex- 
treme views seems acceptable. It is generally held by 
students of the subject that Freud has erred in failing 
to perceive other urges such as to satisfy hunger or 
‘thirst, whieh are as potent and insistent as sex, and that 
perhaps because of his zealousness in maintaining his 
theory, he has imagined the functioning of “libido” in 
activities where it did not exist at all) He has, however; 
done a worthy service in suggesting the subtleness with 
which a native impulse may work and the wide degree 
to which its influence may pervade human life. 
In the theory of James, it appears that the number 
of instincts, 7.e. “the special adjustments—ready-made in 
anticipation of the outer things among which (we) are 
to dwell,” has been over-estimated.. As we saw in
-P-A-G-E-236
  220 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Chapter V the number of native patterns of response in 
man is probably less than in some animals. 
The true account of human dynamic forces probably 
lies between the two extremes represented by Freud and 
James. Such an account we shall try to sketch briefly, 
beginning with a statement of the main suppositions 
which will be more fully explained and illustrated later. 
The assumption is that mankind has, compared to the 
animals, a smaller number of ready-made, hard-and- 
fast hereditary motor adjustments each elicited exclu- 
sively by particular situations. But, while he has rela- 
tively few native reactions fitted to particular things “as 
locks are fitted to their doors,” man does have by nature 
a very large number of loosely organized motor activi- 
ties, some or all of which may be brought to bear to 
secure any particular end—to shake off a human an- 
tagonist, to remove an inanimate obstacle, to struggle 
for a bit of food or a mate. The human repertoire of 
action may, in whole or part, be called into play under 
_ the impulsion of each of several urges. The urges or 
cravings, in other words, rather than the fixed motor 
activities, are the primary matters. They are probably 
more numerous than the cravings of other animals. Man 
has more diverse and more numerous urges but fewer 
ready-made methods of satisfying them. Much of his 
learning is directed toward the acquisition of activities 
which satisfy his wants. The hypothesis is, then, that 
the springs of human action are to be found in a num- 
ber of impulses or urges, some of which are native. 
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE IMPULSES AND URGES. 
Before undertaking an inventory of the dominant 
human urges, an illustration of the nature and dynamic!- 
function of a typical sample may be given.
-P-A-G-E-237
  THE DOMINANT HUMAN URGES 221 
The Urge of Hunger.—The urge to secure food when 
hungry which has been studied in infants, adults and 
animals (by Wada) portrays the several features of a 
characteristic human -impulsion. First, there must be a 
stimulus of some sort to arouse the urge. The craving 
is not a condition which appears mysteriously; it is a 
definite reaction produced by a stimulus. In the case 
of the urge to secure food, the stimulus is a complex 
of internal conditions of which one invariable symptom 
is a certain state of muscular activity in the upper part 
of the stomach. For this urge it happens that there 
is a particular name, hunger. Hunger, itself a response, 
is impulsive in character; it is clearly an urge directed 
toward an end, namely the eating of food. When the 
urge comes on, the subject usually becomes restless; in- 
fants begin to squirm in their cribs, turn the face about, 
move the lips, and if these seeking activities are to no 
avail, crying may ensue. Adults engaged in sedentary 
work, are likely to rise and move about; if asleep, they 
may twist and turn, often waking. Animals, which like 
infants, have not acquired habits of directing their atten- 
tion from the hunger urges, become restless, then actively 
begin to strive to secure food. If the end reaction, the 
eating, is long delayed the urge is accompanied by an 
unpleasant feeling as any man will assert when dinner 
is late. Animals and infants under sharp delayed hunger 
will become violently active. Unsatisfied urges, then, are 
usually unpleasant and highly productive of action, of 
strivings for relief. To secure the ends to which the 
urge directs—the eating of food in this instance—is 
satisfying and the restless yearning subsides. 
The Dynamic Réle of the Urge——While there are 
certain interesting facts concerning the things infants 
and animals instinctively do when activated by the food

222 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
seeking urge, such as the native ways of picking up, 
carrying to the mouth, sucking or chews; ways of spit- 
ting or letting drool out when fed, the more important 
psychological factor is the craving itself and the way in 
which it motivates activity. Hunger is a powerful urge 
which persists as long as life and health. It is certainly 
a craving extensive in its influence on behavior and 
learning. That it is continually at work in the life 
of animals is obvious and among men, despite our efforts 
to reduce its effects by adopting careful and regular , 
habits of relief, it may still influence our lives profoundly. 
It dictates or interferes with the daily ordering of our 
tasks, it may influence our choice of residence or wife, 
it may be a motive, subtle and unsuspected, in actions 
which range from the choice of newspapers to the con- 
quest of nations. How great the ramifications, how in- 
direct the expressions of the food seeking urge has never 
been fully disclosed. 
Urges Important Factors in Determining Human 
Conduct.—An urge is conceived to be a form of adjust- 
ment which is a reaction aroused by some inner condi- 
tion of the body or by some external situation or both. 
Human activity and learning is believed to be in con- 
siderable measure initiated and sustained by such urges. 
Beneath many of our acts one or several cravings may 
be. found. Life may be largely directed, wisely or un- 
wisely, toward the relief of a number of dominant urges. 
To ascertain how numerous these main yearnings are 
and whether the ones found are native or acquired are 
the problems before us. : 
The Use of the Terms, Urge, Impulse, Etc.—There 
are many varieties of impulsive activities and various 
terms applied to them. The term impulse is generally 
used to describe the preparatory reaction preceding some  
-P-A-G-E-239
THE DOMINANT HUMAN URGES 
definite response. We speak of the impulse to sneeze, 
strike, speak or drink. Any reaction may bé preceded by 
an impulse. The impulse is essentially the awareness of 
the readiness or urge to act. When such an act as sneez- 
ing, coughing, or winking occurs promptly, following its 
natural stimulus, the impulse is scarcely observed. In 
the event of a delay, the presence of the impulse is clearly 
manifest. Under circumstances which render it impolite 
to sneeze, cough or wink, the impulse is specially vivid. 
The factor of impulsiveness, of urgency to action, is the 
essence of interest. To experience an interest in hats is to 
feel an impulse to see hats, or to react to them in some 
other way. A desire is also an urge to some action. To 
experience a desire to secure social approval is obviously 
to feel an urge. For every act or line of action, there are 
corresponding impulses or urges. Different terms are 
used to suit different types of impulsive experiences. 
Impulse applies chiefly to specific definite acts; it im- 
plies, moreover, that the readiness to react is conscious, 
and may not, therefore, be applied so securely to animals 
concerning whose conscious life we know so little. The 
term urge does not necessarily imply ordinary conscious- 
ness and suggests a dynamic tendency of a more general 
character, such as the urge to secure food or sleep. It 
suggests a more abiding search for relief than impulse, 
Cravings or wants vary but slightly from urge. The 
terms tendency to action and determining tendency have 
been used to cover all varieties of impulses and urges. 
The terms have the advantage of not implying conscious 
processes and are therefore applicable to animals. They 
do not seem to us to be as adequately suggestive of the 
dynamic nature of the activities as impulse and urge. 
Drive has been used but its frequent: association with 
external mechanical forces, such as drive a post or drive Le 
      
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  224 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
a horse, renders it a bit less descriptive than wge. Mainly 
we shall use’the terms impulse and urge but others may 
be used at times as essentially equivalent. ; 
Are the Dominant Urges Native or Acquired?—The 
food seeking urge, used for the purpose of illustration, 
is certainly native. It is found universally and appears 
at birth; it could not be acquired, although all sorts of 
activities may be learned by means of which this cray- 
ing is afforded relief. Other fairly strong urges appear, 
however, which at first sight seem clearly to be acquired. 
Consider a man who has become accustomed to smoking 
a cigar after dinner. When the meal is over, the urge 
to smoke becomes active. If the supply of cigars is un- 
expectedly exhausted, the annoyance of deprivation is 
usually evident. The urge may become very strong. 
The victim becoming increasingly restless may at length 
jam on his hat to walk several blocks to the store in order, 
as we may say, to “satisfy his habit.” So with other 
types of acquired activities—the paper at breakfast, the 
afternoon nap, afternoon tea or tennis, the Saturday 
night trip to the movies—once they are habituated, the 
proper setting arouses the urge.. Smoking or reading the 
newspaper is obviously acquired. Hence it would seem 
necessary to admit that many urges are learned. Some 
students, however—notably McDougall—are unwilling to 
make this blunt admission. True, they may agree that 
smoking is acquired and that it embraces a craving, but 
they insist on a deeper inquiry. How happened it that 
the man began to smoke? And when the answer is 
determined, they believe it will be found that the habit 
was initiated and sustained because it satisfied some other 
native craving. All habits, in a phrase, are born of 
instinctive cravings and live as their servants. 
Before this view can be adequately appraised the main
-P-A-G-E-241
  THE DOMINANT HUMAN URGES 225 
human urges must be marshalled before us. But as this 
is being done, we shall encounter difficulties in deciding 
whether some are native and primary or secondary and 
acquired. Such cravings, as those for a smoke or for a 
game of bridge, we shall disregard—they are not primary 
and not nearly universal in the human species. We 
shall confine ourselves to those that seem to be universal; 
those that prevail everywhere. Universality is not, how- 
ever, conclusive evidence of nativeness. In some in- 
stance it will be impossible to tell whether the urge is 
native and primary or not. Merely to know that certain 
traits are universal characteristics of humanity, however, 
is in itself interesting and practically important. In the 
list to be presented shortly, a number of urges generally 
believed to be at least universal, and by many, both uni- 
versal and instinctive, will be presented with comments 
as to the likelihood of the trait possessing one or both 
characteristics. 
Urcrs Arousep PRIMARILY BY ORGANIC CONDITIONS. 
In the first group are a number of urges which are 
primarily aroused by organic conditions. Some are not 
aroused exclusively by inner conditions since external 
situations also exert more or less influence. Hunger, 
for example, primarily a response to organic conditions, is 
intensified by the sight and smell of food and reduced by 
unpleasant visions and odors. It is, however, difficult 
to activate real hunger except when a certain organic 
condition prevails in some degree. Usually such an inner 
state is the primary stimulus to which the urge is a 
response. 
The main urges of this type may be described as 
follows:
-P-A-G-E-242

substances or conditions.

Relative Strengths of the Several Organic Urges.— 
To appraise the several organic urges in terms of their in- 
sistence when unsatisfied, in terms of the réles which they 
play in habit formation or in terms of the good or evil, 
individual and social, resulting from such adjustments is 
a difficult task not as yet fully accomplished. 
Réle of the Sex Urges.—While admitting to the sex 
impulse great strength and importance, psychologists 
are generally of the opinion that Freud and his fol- 
lowers have given it an exaggerated potency. While 
the origin of life depends upon sex impulses, life itself 
is more than sex. Hunger, thirst, and impulses to secure 
air and warmth are, so far as living is concerned, equally 
insistent and probably equally influential in determining 
the course of life’s endeavors. Marital relationship is 
broader than sex; there are problems of food and shelter, 
activity and rest, sympathy and parental labors, that 
require adjustment and may result in compatibility or 
lack of it. That thwarting of the sex impulse appears 
to be so conspicuous a source of difficulty in civilized 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
THE DOMINANT HUMAN URGES 227 
life is the result not solely of the strength of these drives 
but partly of the frequency with which they are aroused 
only to be inhibited. Delayed marriage together with 
the insinuations of shame and indecency and social taboos 
provide the soil in which perverted and distorted habits 
of body and mind may grow from entirely decent but 
persistent impulses. Better understanding and better 
management is required for the mating impulses which 
are in themselves but one of many native drives, and 
no more shameful, no more insistent and probably no 
more powerful than others. 
Urges to Sectire Rest and Action—The urges to se- 
cure rest and activity are alternating; one succeeding 
the other. Both appear in all animal species; both are 
instinctive. Each is as insistent, in its proper time, as 
the other; both are of biological utility. Rest is pro- 
tective; continuous activity without rest would be 
destructive. Activity, like rest, is satisfying. Action, 
quite apart from its results such as the securing of food, 
etc., is gratifying in its own right. We experience urges 
merely to be active; and such activity is its own sufficient 
reward, This is apparent in the play of animals, chil- 
dren and adults. Much of play is activity engaged in for 
its intrinsic enjoyment. Action of this sort is not with- 
out usefulness; it provides the opportunity for the devel- 
opment of ability to manage the body and mind. The 
individual who is inactive when not aroused by urges 
of hunger, thirst, sex, or others, will fail to develop as 
fully, will fail to acquire as many skills and as much in- 
formation as the one which engages in activity even if 
for no other purpose other than the satisfaction which 
such action itself provides. In the impulse to be active 
is found the incentive and the occasion for learning, for 
acquiring facts and skills which may be utilized, not 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  228 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
merely later for adult needs as some have said, but there 
and then in adjustment to the conditions of life. 
Activity, as here used, means not merely muscular 
activity but all forms—manipulative, vocal and mental. 
The undirected activities of animals and children in- 
clude not only running, jumping, dancing, shouting, 
singing, manipulation but exploration and experimenta- 
tion with the sense organs, the unraveling of novelties, 
the acquisition of information of all sorts. It is im- 
portant to realize that the urge to learn is native and 
that learning is not wholly derived from ulterior mo- 
tives but is satisfying for its own sake. 
Urges to Escape and Reject.—These two urges, ap- 
parent in the prepotent motor reactions in infants, are 
natively aroused only on occasions by certain dangerous 
or disagreeable situations or substances. When aroused, 
the urges to escape or get rid of painful or disagreeable 
stimuli are exceedingly insistent and may produce most 
violent action. Such urges, in the course of time, may 
be aroused in the absence of direct stimulation by asso- 
ciated stimuli (by forms of associative learning to be 
explained in Chapter XI) and thus serve to activate 
precautionary activities such as the construction of 
houses, of protective clothes, carrying of weapons, de- 
struction of dangerous beasts, insects, plants, bacteria, 
and the like. The urge to protect oneself from dangerous 
and noxious things and conditions in this manner be- 
comes a considerable factor in the ordering of life. 
The Importance of the Organic Urges.—That these 
organic urges are instinctive in man is almost unani- 
mously agreed by competent students. There is a con- 
sensus of opinion, too, that such instincts are potent 
sources of human strivings. Men will go to great ex- 
tremes to satisfy the urges of hunger, thirst, sex and
-P-A-G-E-245
THE DOMINANT HUMAN URGES 229 
other organic needs. Under acute heat, suffocation or 
thirst activities for relief may attain the level of violence. 
The traveler lost in the snow or the unrelieved soldier 
may give way to the impulse to sleep even if death is 
the probable result. The sex impulse, fully activated, 
may overcome ideals of propriety and the fears of dis- 
grace or punishment. According to the views of some, 
the main goal of human conduct to which our innate 
urges impel us is the attainment of a condition of organic 
comfort and the avoidance of organic distress. To some 
who hold this view, many or all of our daily endeavors, 
our intellectual, athletic, avocational and vocational pur- 
suits, are conceived as strivings to achieve these ends. 
Our multiform activities, personal and social, are in- 
itiated and sustained in the service of our organic 
cravings. 
Like the animals, among which these motives are more 
obviously paramount, men in general do not necessarily 
realize—indeed, probably rarely do understand—the 
forces which determine their conduct. As the influences 
which determine the distribution and control of the circu- 
lation of the blood are ascertained only by dint of exten- 
sive research so the factors which occasion and control 
human conduct in everyday life are disclosed only by 
diligent and skilled study. If the statement, then, that 
human activities are primarily, or even extensively en- 
listed in the services of organic welfare is a surprise to 
the average man and appears to be rather uncomplimen- 
tary to him, it need not be on that account incorrect. 
Summary.—There can be no doubt on several points. 
First, that the impulses and striving aroused by organic 
needs are instinctive; second, that such urges and efforts 
are important springs of human activity in the everyday 
life of both adults and children, and. third, that in-
-P-A-G-E-246
230 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
numerable habits based upon these drives are formed— 
habits of which the initiating and sustaining forces may 
not be recognized by the one who possesses them. 
The view that the organic urges are the sole or even 
the main springs of human action is a problem to which 
consideration should now be given. 
OtHerR DomMINANT URrcEs. 
It may at once be said that many competent students 
of human nature believe that the organic urges by no 
means exhaust the list. They will not agree to the 
view that human strivings are limited, directly or indi- 
rectly, to efforts to appease organic cravings or secure 
organic satisfaction. Other urges, equally influential, 
are assumed to motivate human activity and learning. 
Some believe that many or all of these urges are in- 
stinctive, and that they are primary and irreducible to 
more fundamental cravings. The character of such sug- 
gested urges is indicated by the following list which is 
representative rather than exhaustive. Some of these 
urges will be scarcely acceptable as fundamental and 
primary; some will be subdivided into other possible 
urges. Each “urge” moreover is not to be thought of 
as single and indivisible but rather as a name applied to 
a group of particular impulses which are more or less 
similar. 
1. The urge to collect and hoard. 
2. The urge to excel and succeed—the ‘ ‘mastery im- 
pulse.” 
3. The urge to fight persistent interference. 
4. The urge ‘to fight for its own sake—pugnacious im- 
pulse. 
5. The urge to be submissive. 
6. The urge to secure sympathy.
-P-A-G-E-247
THE DOMINANT HUMAN URGES 231 
7. The urge to hunt and destroy. 
8. The urge torelieve suffering—“‘impulse of sym- 
pathy.” 
9. The urge to beget children—“parental impulse.” 
10. The urge to care for, protect, begotten children. 
11. The urge to be in a group of same species—“gre- 
garjous impulse.” 
12. The urge to secure social approval. 
13. The urge to avoid social disapproval. 
In briefly considering these urges in turn, we shall con- 
sider several problems: 
(1) Is the urge typical of, or practically universal in, 
mankind; 
(2) Is it instinctive or acquired; 
(3) Is it primarily and irreducible to other urges or 
is it secondary, merely the expression of other urges 
singly or in combination. 
Collecting and Hoarding.—The child tends to ap- 
proach objects which attract his attention, pick them up 
and cling to them. Often he carries them away to some 
place of storage. By some it is believed that this tend- 
ency to collect and hoard is instinctive and primary. 
It is believed that, in the presence of such objects, urges 
to seize and accumulate are aroused as instinctively as 
in the squirrel, and that to carry out such acts is gratify- 
ing like the appeasing of hunger. Quite apart from the 
value the objects collected may have as food or imple- 
ments and the like, there is satisfaction in consummating 
the mere urge to collect once it is aroused. 
According to this view, the urge to collect and hoard 
in a world of attractive objects becomes constantly 
aroused. The child collects at first bits of colored twine 
or paper, cigar bands, stamps, pictures, trinkets of all 
sorts; as an adult he may collect other things—rugs,
-P-A-G-E-248
232 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
hunting implements or books—but the same sort of urge 
is present and the same sort of satisfaction in getting 
and keeping is secured. Man, then, according to this 
view may be described as instinctively an acquisitive 
animal; the urge merely to have and hold characterizes 
his life. 
While the tendency to collect’ and hoard is usually ad- 
mitted to be an important human attribute, there is 
some opposition to the idea that it is instinctive and 
primary. Some believe that it is a habit acquired by 
virtue of its effect in providing food, shelter, objects for 
manipulation or study, social approval and the like. 
While it must be admitted that the issue cannot now 
be decided, the acquisitive urge may be accepted as 
significant. 
The Urge to Excel and Siaveneietne Mastery Im- 
pulses.—The urge to excel and succeed may be sub- 
divided into several, such as the urge to overcome opposi- 
tion, to resist domination by other persons, to dominate 
or master things, to dominate other people, to excel a 
rival and to achieve success in undertakings. Each phase 
of the urge merits brief description. 
The Urge to Overcome Opposition and Obstruction: 
—It is characteristic of children and adults to desire to 
go about their play or work without interference. To 
any kind of obstruction the native reaction is the arousal 
of an urge which results in vigorous activity, directed 
toward the removal of the obstacle. A child’s toy which 
will not work, a door which will not open, a block of 
wood which will not split, a thicket which will not permit 
passage—all such impediments provoke impulses and 
acts to overcome them. So commands and restrictions, 
in so far as they interfere with activities under way, 
tend to arouse resistance. 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
THE DOMINANT HUMAN URGES 233 
The tendency to overcome obstructions and interfer- 
ence was shown in an interesting way in a laboratory 
experiment (by Morgan) in which a subject engaged 
in the task of typewriting was subjected to a number of 
distractions, such as the sounds of buzzers and bells, or 
sudden changes in illumination. He was at once aroused 
to overcome such interferences. His pulse ran up, his 
brow was wrinkled, teeth were clenched, the keys were 
pounded harder than usual, and in most instances the 
typing was kept up to the average, although more energy 
than usual was consumed. 
Such behavior may be considered as due to the arousal 
in various situations of the urge to succeed, to complete 
a task, to consummate a purpose undertaken. Influences 
which interfere may activate more acutely the desire to 
succeed. When subject to the impulse, one may attack the 
interference. Physical obstacles, and distractions. or the 
interference of persons and attempts at domination by 
others all tend to arouse the urge which aims at success- 
fully overcoming them. 3 
The Urge to Dominate People and Things:—The 
child not only resists interference and domination but 
he also likes his blocks to stay put, his horn to blow, his 
dog to come when called, his playmates to follow orders. 
This is another expression of the urge to succeed, to have 
his projects, whatever they may be, go through to a com- 
pletion successfully. To succeed in any undertaking is 
intrinsically satisfying quite apart from the other results 
achieved such as facts learned, skills acquired, food, 
prizes, or social approval secured. This phase of the 
urge to succeed is often called the “mastery impulse.” 
Adults show evidence of this urge in innumerable direc- 
tions. To climb an imposing tree or chop one down, to 
breast a strong current, to “break” a spirited horse, to 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
234 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
ascend a steep hill “on high,” to lift a huge weight, to 
down a worthy opponent in wrestling, to solve a knotty 
problem, to swing a big deal or boss a crew of men are 
particular ways in which the urge may find gratification. 
The Urge to Excel a Rival:—A keenly satisfying form 
of success consists in the-excelling of a rival. Man 
keenly loves competition. The gratification of outdoing 
a competitor is one of the mainsprings of interest in games 
and sports of all sorts—chess, bridge, tag, baseball, tennis. 
This urge operates from early childhood to the end of 
life. It takes uncounted forms; in practically any ac- 
tivity, the presence of another who may be taken (even if 
he is unaware of it) as a competitor adds zest to the 
work and elicits greater efforts from the worker. How 
effective the urge is when activated in this way will be 
disclosed in some detail later. (Chapter XVI.) 
The Urge to Succeed, in General:—The craving for 
success, in all of its manifold forms, is one of the most 
interesting and important human urges. However 
humble or trivial the activity may be, if one is demon- 
strably a success—that is, if he can overcome the diffi- 
culties in the task, can master the situation and excel his 
accepted rivals—one of the keenest human gratifications 
is realized. These facts appeared interestingly in a study 
(by Meek) of the first efforts of children, three to five 
years of age, to learn to read words. Some succeeded 
quickly in mastering the first lesson but a few failed 
completely. Those who succeeded came back to the 
lesson happily on the second day. Those’ who failed 
were less eager, and after a few further failures were 
exceedingly reluctant, sometimes testifying to other more 
important engagements or hiding behind the piano. 
They hated this task which brought them failure even 
when they were praised for their efforts or otherwise
-P-A-G-E-251
Ri let aN a ka a NR al i A 
THE DOMINANT HUMAN URGES 235 
rewarded. Some who were coaxed back were skillfully 
shown how. to attack the learning of the words. They 
succeeded. Next day, success again; and soon an en- 
tirely new attitude, a happy and eager interest in read- 
ing. Nothing makes functioning more satisfying than 
success; nothing stimulates further efforts to achieve 
like success. We do not like difficulties except as they 
provide opportunities for success. _What we crave is suc- 
cessfully to overcome difficulties. 
Are these several urges primary or merely a special 
combination or pattern of other impulses? They cer- 
tainly seem to be intrinsic urges with a specific gratifica- 
tion. Are they native or acquired? We do not know. 
Some believe they are; others believe they are acquired 
by experiences much as the urge to smoke is acquired. 
Unlike the craving for smoking, the urges to succeed are 
practically universal. While it is possible that the im- 
pulses described separately as the urge to overcome ob- 
structions and interferences, the urge to resist domina- 
tion by people, the urge to dominate things, the urge to 
dominate people and the urge to excel a rival may be 
but several phases of a common urge to overcome diffi- 
culties or interferences successfully, it will usually be 
found convenient and helpful to think in terms of the 
particular forms. 
Fighting to Overcome Interference.—The tendency 
to overcome obstructions to, or interference with, an 
activity under way is a close kin of the impulse to seek 
domination actively, and both are related to fighting. 
Think of a boy building a play-house. If all goes well, 
each nail driven and each board affixed satisfies his im- 
pulse of mastery, and the thought of the completed house 
isa stimulus to his self-assertion. Let some of the boards 
split or some of the nails bend, and the boy is aroused    
-P-A-G-E-252
eT ea ee eT Tp en eT eR ee 
236 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
to overcome these obstructions to progress. If things 
go from bad to worse, swelling rage may lead to a fighting 
attack in which the structure is utterly demolished. Or, 
with things going well enough, if another boy interferes 
by word or deed, disregarding commands to desist, he 
may be the object of attack. The stimulus in fighting is 
an interference with an activity under way. The pug- 
nacious attack is simply the most violent form of the 
effort to overcome an obstruction in the path of one’s 
action, and inasmuch as it is the last resort, it is a less 
frequent reaction. Fighting in such instances is not 
primary and its own sufficient reward; it is a means to 
an end. The*removal of the obstacle or the successful 
issue of the combat, rather than the combat itself is 
gratifying. ee 
The Alleged Urge to Fight for Its Own Sake.—By 
some it has been maintained that there is an urge to 
fight quite irrespective of the provocation or the out- 
come; a craving to engage in battle just for the satisfac- 
tion of combat. An investigator who followed the activi- 
ties of boys’ gangs found among these healthy and vigor- 
ous youths very frequent individual, “free for all” and 
intergang combats. The zest for battle appeared so 
keen that some have been led to believe that it was 
primary and irreducible to other urges. It was a zest for 
combat pure and simple. It is said, furthermore, than 
this impulse persists into adult life despite efforts to 
curb its expression. Most of us, it is said, liking battle 
but having an eye to propriety of conduct, and also to 
the danger of injury, get our thrills by reading about 
or observing others fight—prize fights have drawn gate 
receipts of a half-million dollars—or instead of fighting 
with tooth and fist, we learn to attack with cutting re- 
marks, piercing looks or annihilating thoughts only. We  
-P-A-G-E-253
THE DOMINANT HUMAN URGES 237 
are, it is said, fundamentally pugnacious and to a degree 
feel the craving to fight. 
It is not conceded by all authorities that this type of 
fighting urge—the mere craving for combat—is a uni- 
versal human characteristic; much less that it is native or 
primary. It is maintained by some, for example, that 
fighting is always done to secure mastery or social ap- 
proval or, under primitive ‘conditions, to secure food, 
shelter, mates or some other reward. The “pugnacious 
mood” is also explained as funamentally depending on 
some interfering or disturbing factor, such as bodily dis- 
comfort or irritation—fatigue or indigestion—or upon 
thwarted cravings of some sort. Thus fighting is con- 
ceived as a secondary means to some end, to the attain- 
ment of satisfaction for some other urge, rather than as 
due to a specific craving for combat. Evidence necessary 
for a final decision is not available as yet ;.we shall there- 
fore put fighting on the uncertain list. 
The Urge to Hunt and Destroy.—The desire to hunt 
is sometimes included among the primary cravings. It 
is alleged that children at a certain age experience im- 
pulses to chase and capture small animals much as the 
kittens are observed to do. Later, as such reactions are 
killed off by training, it is alleged that the hunting im- 
pulses secure gratification in the teasing, and hounding 
of eccentric characters, unpopular leaders, or minority 
groups such as Quakers, Chinese, etc., in America, or in 
running to earth and destroying wild game, or even 
human beings as in the hastily conceived mobs or lynch- 
ing parties. While such unreasoned brutality doubtless 
is prevalent among mankind, it may be accounted for in 
terms of other cravings and hence considered secondary. 
The early “hunting” of the child may be an expression of 
the food seeking or collecting impulses or mere curiosity; 
   
-P-A-G-E-254
  238 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
the bullying of adults may be accounted for in terms of 
impulses to secure the mastery, to dominate and vic- 
toriously engage in combat. The hunting of game, 
widely enjoyed by men, may be similarly explained— 
food getting, collecting, mastery and successful combat 
are served at once. Hunting, then, is probably not spe- 
cific and independent of other impulses, Although sec- 
ondary and derived the zest for teasing, harassing, 
plundering, attacking and damaging is doubtless nearly 
universal in mankind. 
The Urge to Submit.—Submission is the antithesis of 
the tendencies to overcome opposition, to secure mastery 
and to fight. Forced submission to an obstinate obstruc- 
tion or to a superior opponent is frequent enough, but it 
is not a source of satisfaction. It is characterized by 
such behavior as weeping, anger, chagrin, envy, jealousy, 
shame or embarrassment. Frequently, however, there 
appears an impulse to submit when submission seems to 
be gratifying. The situation which provokes submission 
is one which obviously cannot be mastered. Thus the 
child may be submissive to the adult, the adult to a wiser 
or more influential person, or to society as a whole. 
Admiration, awe, reverence, veneration, “hero worship,” 
are indicative of willing submission. Universal tenden- 
cies to be awed by, as well as to venerate and idolize 
unusual, unintelligible or powerful natural phenomena, 
such as winds, thunder, or the sun, perhaps are rooted 
in an urge to be submissive as well as in fear. We seem, 
then, to desire to have, as well as to be, a leader or boss. 
These two impulses are not inconsistent but reciprocal. 
In submission, one is unaggressive, deferential and admir- 
ing, behavior that is satisfying, when to it the attitude 
of the superior is appreciative and kindly even if digni- 
fied and condescending. In mastery, the positions are
-P-A-G-E-255
  
THE DOMINANT HUMAN URGES 239 
reversed; the satisfaction is equally great but of a dif- 
ferent kind. 
The Craving for Sympathy.—The impulse to be sub- 
missive is closely related to the craving for sympathy. 
When submissive, we expect kindly and sympathetic 
mastery. Sympathy the human species universally 
craves. To secure consolation the child eagerly displays 
his injury; or as has sometimes been observed, inflicts 
a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant pity. For the 
same purpose, adults are disposed to show their bruises, 
relate their accidents, illnesses—especially the details of 
surgical operations—hardships and misfortunes. Some 
become chronically addicted to tales of woe as a means 
of securing bounteous sympathy. “Self pity” for mis- 
fortunes, real or imaginary, is in some measure practically 
a universal practice. To secure sympathy is clearly a 
strong and essentially’ universal human urge. It is 
doubtless one of the impulses involved in many instances 
of submissive behavior but probably does not fully ac- 
count for all forms of submission. The urge to secure 
sympathy seems primary but it is not clear whether it 
is native or acquired. 
The Urge to Relieve Suffering—the “Impulse of 
Sympathy.”—While the urge to secure sympathy is 
strong and clear, the urge to express compassion by active 
efforts to relieve misfortune and suffering has not always 
been quite so apparent, at least not apparently primary 
and fundamental, in the human species. Yet sym- 
pathetic behavior of some sort is characteristic of most 
animals. Plaintive cries of distress and other evidences 
of suffering usually arouse in the human being an urge 
to relieve the sufferer. The prevalence of societies for 
the prevention of cruelty to animals, of child labor, for 
- the relief of distress in foreign lands; public institutions  
-P-A-G-E-256
  240 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
for the poor, homeless, blind, feebleminded and other 
types of good-will are evidences of a widespread urgent 
compassion. At the same time it is necessary to explain 
the extensive brutality exercised by man upon other 
men and animals with which history is replete. The 
explanation is that mankind is at once sympathetic and 
self-seeking. The urge to relieve suffering, we believe, is 
fundamental, but, living in competition with the urge to 
secure food, achieve success and mastery, collect and 
hoard, ete., it is often submerged. For social welfare, 
the sympathetic tendencies, obscure as they often seem, 
are of prime import. Because they are often overthrown 
by antagonistic urges, the home, school and church do 
and must join forces in encouraging and rewarding the 
sympathetic dispositions as a means of promoting the 
ideal social life, conceived by human intelligence but 
with difficulty achieved in human behavior. 
The Urges to Beget and Care for Children—the 
Parental Urges.—The parental urge, first of all, must be 
distinguished from mere sex craving. The questions are: 
(1) whether there is in men, women, or both, a specific 
urge that is satisfied by having offspring, and (2) once 
children are begot, whether there is a specific satisfaction 
in caring for them. 
It has not been demonstrated for man or any other 
species, that an urge, either instinctive or universal, for 
begetting children appears. It is true, of course, that 
most people desire children but this may be explained 
as a resultant of the desire for the approval and satisfac- 
tion and pride which follows successfully overcoming dif- - 
ficulties of living up to acquired ideals of duty and of 
successfully accepting the responsibilities of life. For 
women, the bringing up of children has the added zest 
of the most worthy, and for many, a relatively attractive
-P-A-G-E-257
  THE DOMINANT HUMAN URGES 241 
occupation. It seems unlikely, therefore, that there is a 
strong anticipatory urge, specific in character, to beget 
children. The interest in having offspring is probably 
secondary and acquired. 
Once children are born; what specific fundamental 
urges are brought into play? Among competent stu- 
dents there is nearly unanimous agreement that the infant 
is a potent source of urges which are satisfied only by 
evidences of its comfort and well-being. The urge to 
care for and protect valiantly the begotten children is 
strikingly apparent in many animal as well as human 
parents. Mothers, human or animal, seem especially re- 
sponsive for a time after birth perhaps as a result of their 
organic condition. It is unlikely, however, as suggested 
in the preceding chapter, that human parents have in- 
herited motor activities of caring for the infant in forms 
approximating the elaborate, and apparently, instinctive 
behavior of many lower animals. 
It is probable, then, that the human species does not 
inherit a specific urge to beget young, or complex activi- 
ties of caring for the young, but that it does inherit urges 
to care for and protect the child, once begotten. 
The Urge to Be in a Group—the Gregarious Impulse. 
—Gregarious animals, buffaloes, sheep and wolves, are 
those which live in herds or flocks. Others, such as cats, 
tigers and lions, are solitary beasts. Given the same 
opportunities to live together, they prefer solitude. The 
human species is essentially gregarious; the seclusive 
individual, rarely found, is regarded as abnormal. For 
these reasons, it has been usual to assume that gregari- 
ousness in man is a fundamental instinctive urge—a con- 
clusion not universally accepted. 
Strictly speaking, gregariousness is merely an impulse 
to be with other people. We feel more comfortable 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  242 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
under most circumstances when with companions; rarely 
does one choose to live in entire isolation. When quite 
alone we become uneasy and lonesome; solitary confine- 
ment is a torturous punishment which usually brings 
confession or breakdown. No one of repute questions 
the existence of the gregarious impulse, but several deny 
it a specifically instinctive character. They argue that 
it is acquired. Having lived with people from the first, 
we become “used to” them. When they are gone we 
feel at a loss much as we feel the loss of a pipe, a friendly 
chair or as we may feel an uncomfortable lonesomeness 
after leaving the familiar surroundings of home. More 
than that, from childhood others of our species have given 
us aids and comforts of innumerable sorts; we like to be 
with others because we have learned that they add to 
our security and comfort; they enable us, moreover, to 
satisfy our submissive, mastery, parental, mating and 
other impulses. Any one of these conditions, it is as- 
serted, is sufficient explanation of the gregarious impulses. 
The gregarious urge at least is strong and essentially 
universal in man but whether primary and instinctive 
cannot now be said. 
Urge to Secure Social Approval——The impulse to 
secure social approval goes beyond the mere satisfaction 
of being in a group. The approving words, glances, 
smiles or attitudes of other people are among the keenest 
sources of satisfaction. In numberless direct or subtle 
ways we seek approval; the child, by displaying his 
repertoire of tricks; the youth, his strength, daring and 
skill; the adult, by means of personal appearance, clothes, 
relatives, social connections, wealth, achievement in busi- 
ness, politics, society, athletics, philanthropy, or by wit, 
generosity, aloofness, and in other ways too diverse to 
recount. Lacking superiority in skill or valor, social
-P-A-G-E-259
THE DOMINANT HUMAN URGES 243 
virtues, personal appearance or intellectual accomplish- 
ment, one may resort to fine manners, fine talk, extrava- 
gance, boasting or arrogance. 
Urge to Avoid Social Disapproval.—as approval is a 
keen satisfier, so social disapproval may make life intol- 
erable. Our sensitivity to facial blemishes or bodily 
disfigurement, the misery occasioned by a social blunder 
or a public criticism, are as intense as they are irrational. 
We are disturbed even if a dog or a tramp acts disap- 
provingly. A Zurich psychiatrist, Adler, has developed a 
conviction that many nervous and mental disorders are 
the results of the continuous disapproval which physical 
defects or deficiencies may bring. 
In many instances, the urges to secure social approval 
and avoid scorn are similar to the impulses to secure 
mastery and avoid domination. Both may, in fact, be 
operating at the same time, but there is a difference be- 
tween them. One may check his self-assertive tendency 
to a point of submission or humility in order to be con- 
sidered “nice,” although here the desire for social ap- 
proval is conceivably the mastering impulse in disguise. 
On the other hand—and here the distinction is clearer— 
a man may dominate his wife and family or his employees 
or debtors so severely as to bring the disapproval of all 
who observe, yet the hard master may enjoy the role. 
In the case of bullies on the school ground or elsewhere, 
the craving for mastery may run counter to the impulse 
to secure social approval. 
Summary.—This completes a brief survey of the domi- 
nant human urges which have been suggested by students 
of dynamic psychology. Since the opinions as to whether 
each urge ig native or acquired, whether primary and 
irreducible or secondary and derived and whether rela- 
tively strong or weak have not always been unanimous,

the student may be left in some confusion.

While the origin of several of the urges listed, whether 
native or acquired, must be left in doubt pending the 
results of further observation and experiment, a number 
of human cravings which appear universally, or nearly 
universally, have been described at least. For the under- 
standing of human conduct and for dealing with it in 
many practical ways, knowledge of the existence of these 
important impulses is of great significance. How the 
fundamental urges influence thinking, feeling and acting, 
how they modify and control habit formation will be dis- 
closed in the next two chapters. 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. Take the tendency to collect and hoard objects. When does it 
first appear? When is it strongest? When, if ever, does it die 
out? Discuss the probability of its being either native or 
acquired. 
2. There has been an educational doctrine based on the assumption 
that “nature is right, there can be no higher criterion.” It is 
asserted therefore that children should be permitted to develop  
-P-A-G-E-262
  246 
  ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
without inhibition, that they should be permitted to do what- 
ever is “natural” for them to do, on the assumption that nature 
is infallible, that no instinctive trends can be undesirable. In 
the light of available facts, how valid is this doctrine? 
. Is it reasonable to suppose that there may be urges and instincts, 
useful ten thousand years ago, that are not useful now? 
What is the significance of this statement from William James: 
“Man has a far greater variety of impulses than any living ani- 
mal; and any one of these impulses, taken in itself, is as blind 
as the lowest instinct can be; but, owing to man’s memory, 
power of reflection, and power of inference, they come each one 
“to be felt by him with a foresight of those results.” Does James 
10. 
iy. 
12. mean that man arrives eventually at a full understanding of the 
impulses which initiate his activity? 
. Which of the urges listed in the chapter do you experience most 
frequently during the day? Which least frequently? 
Is the fighting urge as strong in women as in men? How would 
you go about discovering the facts by scientific investigation? 
Is play an instinct? Is it universal? Could play be considered 
as the result of the operation of the instincts listed in the text 
rather than as a new instinct? Make a list of various forms of 
play among children or adults and analyze representative forms 
into the impulses operating. Is there anything left unaccounted 
for?

CHAPTER IX 
THE ROLE OF THE DOMINANT URGES IN 
HABIT FORMATION 
Original nature provides us with a number of tenden- 
cies to mental, emotional, and muscular activity. Events 
in the environment or in the body itself are constantly 
providing stimuli which arouse either immediate and 
conclusive responses, typically of the reflex type, or urges 
and states of readiness for further activity which are more 
characteristic of the complex instincts. The same may 
be said of acquired reaction patterns. They, like in- 
stincts, are aroused by stimuli from within the body or 
from some feature of the external environment and, if 
delayed, appear as states of readiness or as conscious 
urges to action. 
Habits once well established operate in every respect 
like instincts. Many habits, however, are really the 
means by which native impulses are expressed, and habits, 
in this sense, are derived from instincts. There is a 
native impulse to manipulate and specific tendencies to 
make a number of particular hand and finger movements; 
but acquired forms of manipulation of toys and imple- 
ments may satisfy the tendency to manipulation quite as 
well. In other cases, the acquired activities may be less 
directly, at least less obviously, akin to the native urges 
and yet activated by them. They may be, as it were, 
native tendencies in disguise. At least, a number of 
urges were discovered, which were so prominent and so 
249
-P-A-G-E-266
250 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
nearly universal in the human species as to make them 
worthy of consideration in connection with everyday life 
and habit formation. These were called the main human 
urges. Although their origin was not always apparent, 
their dynamic potency is considerable as we shall attempt 
to show in this chapter. 
How Dominant Urcres May Br THwartep. 
Why do we not always, if we feel an impulse, carry 
it through to its consummation directly? The answer is 
that the conditions of life often thwart the direct expres- 
sion. The child very early finds his strong impulses 
subject to discipline; he may not eat, yell, throw when 
and what he pleases. As he grows up, he finds that the 
life of the school and playground offer other restrictions 
and each later year may add anew to the inhibitions of 
his conduct. 
The sources of inhibitions of or restrictions upon the 
main urges may be grouped roughly as follows: 
1. Other insistent but antagonistic urges. 
2. Acquired habits, ideals, conventions, taboos. 
3. Obstacles in the environment. 
One fundamental trend may conflict with another or 
several others so that all cannot be gratified. Thus one’s 
desire to accumulate may conflict with the counter de- 
sires to rest, secure immediate sensory ‘satisfactions, or 
social approval by immediate display. The impulse to 
mastery may conflict with the impulse to avoid injury 
in physical encounter. The urge to experience the novel 
may conflict with fear of the unknown or with the satis- 
factions of familiar surroundings. The craving to domi- 
nate, when the objects are our own children, may conflict 
with the parental impulse to treat them tenderly. 
 
-P-A-G-E-267
DOMINANT URGES IN HABIT FORMATION 251 
The strong urges may be thwarted by acquired habits, 
ideals, religious beliefs, or social conventions. In time 
of war, instinctive fears of slaughter may conflict with 
ideals of patriotism. The impulses to pick up attractive 
objects run counter to habits and ideals of honesty. 
Beliefs established in childhood, religious and social train- 
ing, or thoughts of consequences, may inhibit many sex 
urges. The strength of the impulses to collect and 
hoard, to dominate, to fight, to indulge sex are reflected 
by the Ten Commandments, and other religious as well 
as legal, economic, and social enactments. Were these 
urges more easily and generally controlled there would 
be little need of laws and courts, police and prisons, 
social taboos and prohibitions. The existence of these 
institutions and practices is perennial evidence of the 
conviction that all fundamental drives are not socially 
desirable, and that many of them must, therefore, be 
more or less completely diverted or held in check. 
Finally, strong impulses may be thwarted by natural 
obstacles-or-realities. Barrenness of the soil, floods or 
drought, business depression, or the superiority of rivals 
may thwart many as may the death of parents, partners, 
or friends. One’s desire to secure social approval may 
be thwarted by a disfigured face; to attain mastery, 
by an unimposing physique or inadequate intellect. 
Injuries, illness, and other misfortunes are the more 
annoying because they foretell other thwartings. If we 
have a steady job certain cravings, such as those for rest, 
freedom of action, display of authority, may need to be 
foregone; if we lack a steady job, others such as the 
desire to accumulate, to eat abundantly, to secure ap- 
proval, are jeopardized. No matter how favorable the 
conditions of life, the thwarting of many primary im- 
pulses and wants will be constantly experienced.

252 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Wuat Happens WHEN A Stronc Imputss Is THwarTeD? 
What happens when an insistent tendency, being in 
readiness to act, is by some circumstance not permitted 
to act? A general answer to this question is as follows: 
Whenever the organism is ready to act in some way, for 
it‘to act is satisfying; and furthermore, whenever the 
organism is ready to act, for it not to act is annoying. A 
satisfying state of affairs is defined as one which the ani- 
mal seeks and attempts to maintain; an annoying state 
of affairs is one which the animal attempts to avoid or 
change,—to which it reacts negatively. Both are condi- 
tions which demand activity and if the conditions are 
novel, the result of the activity is learning. 
These general statements find concrete illustration in 
experiments upon a cat enclosed in a puzzle box. The 
animal is annoyed by such confinement and this provides 
the motive for efforts to escape. If the cat is at the same 
time hungry, food placed in front of the box adds another 
motive—a readiness to eat. If the way out of the box 
has been previously mastered or if the box yields to such 
activities as cats usually make in such a situation, the 
end results—escaping confinement and reaching the food 
—are at once accomplished. But if the box is unusual, 
the way out must be discovered by a series of trials char- 
acterized usually by many errors before final success is 
achieved. Here we have a typical form of learning; 
learning by “trial and error” or “trial and accidental suc- 
cess” as it is called. The cat bites, digs, claws, pushes, 
pulls, and makes other native and acquired responses to 
the several features, wires, slats, knobs, strings, openings, 
which the box provides; he tries and tries again, until 
finally the solution is hit upon, usually by sheer accident. 
Usually the whole performance must be ‘undergone a 
   
-P-A-G-E-269
Sa ek gen eee Fi ee tee eee ayer ee ees Tne ey ene eee ye eer 
DOMINANT URGES IN HABIT FORMATION 253 
number of times before the “way out” reactions are thor- 
oughly habituated. 
Tn all essentials, man’s behavior when thwarted in his 
efforts to satisfy some strong impulse is like that of the 
cat in the box. He tries in one way or another to secure 
the satisfying and avoid the annoying state of affairs. 
He differs from the cat by learning the “way out” of the 
latter or the “way to” the former more rapidly and with 
better retention. He differs, furthermore, in his capacity 
to make certain mental adjustments to the perplexing 
situation; adjustments which, although involving ideas 
to a degree quite beyond the capacity of the animal are 
achieved by the same “trial and accidental success” 
process that characterized the cat’s escape from the box. 
When the native impulse to collect and hoard, rest, 
dominate others, fight, secure social approval or sex satis- 
faction, or to satisfy other wants are thwarted by ob- 
stacles, or when they come into conflict with each other 
or with our acquired habits, beliefs or ideals, some way 
out of the dilemma is sought by the try-and-try-again 
process; that is, by means of our capacity to learn. The 
adjustments thus made are obviously acquired reactions; 
habits acquired in the service of the fundamental urges. 
InpivipuaL DIFFERENCES IN ABILITY To TOLERATE 
THWARTINGS. 
Individuals moreover differ greatly in the degree to 
which they are annoyed by the thwarting of their wants 
as well as in the characteristic types of adjustment. Some 
people, we all know from observation, can maintain their 
poise in the severest storm of deprivation and misfortune, 
while others are disarrayed by the slightest swirl. Scat- 
tered between the two extremes are the other individuals, 
representing every intermediate degree but most thickly  
-P-A-G-E-270
254 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
clustered in the middle of the group. Those at the 
weaker end are often spoken of by students of nervous 
and mental disorders as “neurotic” or “psychopathic,” 
which means, in a general way, easily upset, very sensitive 
to difficulties in adjustment, and consequently readily 
susceptible to nervous or mental disorders. The position 
which an individual occupies in the group, ranging from 
the most to the least “unstable,” of which the “neurotics” 
compose the former end, is determined in the main by 
original nature, although disease, poisons, shocks, or 
hardships may pull one to a level far lower than his orig- 
inal position. 
It is seldom easy to differentiate the neurotic or nery- 
ously unstable from the extreme case of general emo- 
tionality. In the purest form, the case of extreme 
emotionality represents merely an excessive organic re- 
action to stimuli. There may be internal disturbances of 
a violent type, momentary or -persistent, with relatively 
little misinterpretation of the stimulating events. The 
individual may simply become readily embarrassed, 
chagrined, frightened, unnerved, angered, while quite 
aware of the irrational character of such behavior, just as 
many of us become more or less excited over a public 
performance while quite aware both of the irrational char- 
acter and the futility of the perturbation. The emotion- 
ally unstable individual may make entirely rational and 
wholesome adjustments to his difficulties even though the 
difficulties are great, whereas the psychopathic individual 
is not only intolerant of his thwartings but is unfortunate 
if not irrational in his adjustments. Emotional suscep- 
tibility, however, predisposes to unfortunate adjustments 
and unfortunate adjustments may aggravate emotional 
susceptibility. 
What is meant specifically by the extreme neuropathie
-P-A-G-E-271
DOMINANT URGES IN HABIT FORMATION 255 
or psychopathic dispositions can best be explained by de- 
tailed consideration of particular adjustment tendencies 
of which there are several forms. 
Tue MECHANISM OF INTROVERSION. 
One of the most familiar and certainly one of the most 
convenient ways of securing indirect exercise of a 
thwarted desire or impulse lies in the substitution of 
imaginary for actual conditions. Among children, the 
common day dreams of candies, cakes, toys, and fairies 
are samples. The imaginary companions of the lonesome 
child, which occasionally become phantasies, and the 
“white lies” due to confusion, in recollection, between the 
real and the fancied, are the products of similar mental 
mechanisms more extreme in their operation. Among 
adults, the same tendencies are found, working along 
grown-up lines and normally with little confusion with 
actuality. Excessive day dreaming of the realization of 
desires is technically called introversion (meaning to turn 
inward) and the extreme introvert, at least when subject 
to confusion of fact and fancy, would be commonly classi- 
fied as abnormal or insane. 
The “Conquering Hero” Type.—Among introversions 
there are several tendencies which are alike with respect 
to the mental processes involved and with respect to the 
fact that they are, in some way, clearly satisfying. Per- 
haps most common is the form in which various strong 
impulses—the urge to secure social approval, mastery, 
etc.—are gratified by playing one’s self, in imagination, 
as a “conquering hero.” One may picture himself as a 
hero in battle, on the gridiron, in the prize-ring; as a 
great bandit, singer, or preacher; as the strongest, most 
admired—indeed, as the superlative in any line, even in 
benevolence or modesty. By some imaginary ability or 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
256 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
achievement one becomes an extraordinary person—a 
conquering hero—to whom imaginary approval and ap- 
plause are due. 
These are perfectly normal and universal day dreams 
which bring much satisfaction and little harm to most 
people. But in the extreme form they may be disastrous; 
indeed, they resemble the delusions of grandeur found in 
Paranoia, a form of insanity. The victim of delusions of 
grandeur has become an extreme introvert or has some- 
how lost his grip on reality so that he believes and tells 
you at length that he is the strongest, wealthiest, or in 
some other way the greatest man on earth. Of course, 
these systematic delusions indicate neurotic organization 
to begin with and may be long in developing into the 
extreme form; but fundamentally they are achieved by 
the same kind of mental functioning which results in the 
harmless self-aggrandizement of youth and the ordinary, 
flattering day dreams of adults. 
The “Suffering Hero” Type.—Another tendency of 
imagination or introversion is typified by the ideal ex- 
periences of a suffering hero. While less frequent than 
the conquering-hero variety, this form of imaginary ex- 
perience is equally intelligible and equally satisfying, to 
some people, at least. The fancies may run something 
like this: a boy, ruminating over his hard luck and ill 
treatment (as he sees it) at home or school, pictures 
himself as forced to run away from home. He imagines 
himself joining a group of bandits and going to the bad 
completely, or perhaps overwhelmed by a snowstorm or 
wild beasts, by which he is injured or even killed. Mean- 
while, parents, teachers, some little girl, in fact the whole 
village has become alarmed and repentant, and after 
vigilant search he is brought back a hero, even if a 
wounded one. But perhaps he dies, and if so, it is any-
-P-A-G-E-273
DOMINANT URGES IN HABIT FORMATION 257 
thing but annoying for him to hear the imaginary obitu- 
ary, in which his virtues, appreciated heretofore by none 
but himself, move the congregation to heartrending grief 
and remorse. 
Introversions of this type are highly gratifying partly 
because the subject is, after all, a hero who achieves 
acclaim and partly because approval coupled with sym- 
pathy and pity are all the more sweet. Self-pity, which 
is typical of many neurotics is well fed by introversion 
of the suffering-hero type. 
The suffering-hero mechanism is often behind such 
childish behavior as pouting, sullenness, pretended in- 
juries or illness, refusals to eat or to play. If the new 
doll or dress is not quite up to expectation, the child is 
angered and will not have it at all. A real or imagined 
slight at the party sends the boy home in indignation or 
grief. As a rule, real actions of the wounded-hero type 
are cured more readily than are thoughts. The boy who 
refuses to eat finds, after all, that no one else is much 
disturbed, whereas he gets dreadfully hungry; he who 
leaves the party learns that he misses a great deal of fun 
without being himself missed. But the imagined acts of 
this sort come out more happily. Imaginary starvation is 
more tolerable, and the imagined remorse and pity caused 
by it can be secured, whereas real sympathy from others 
is not always forthcoming. 
Some forms of delusions of persecution in the insane 
have many features in common with the suffering-hero 
introversion although others are developed in different 
ways. Overt acts of martyrdom, ranging from refusals to 
eat or play to the infliction of injuries upon one’s self, 
from the simulation of illness to actual suicide, may be 
the outcome of prolonged or impulsive introversion of 
the suffering-hero type.

258 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Identification.—A somewhat easier and often more 
vivid substitution for genuine action of the sort instinc- 
tively desired may be secured by identifying one’s self 
with the conquering or wounded hero or with other char- 
acters in fiction or on the screen or stage. When the boy 
reads Treasure Island or Robinson Crusoe he actually 
becomes the adventurer. With Nick Carter he holds up 
trains, kills Indians, overcomes ferocious enemies, drops 
over Niagara, and has other experiences at which his orig- 
inal nature thrills but to which it scarcely dares lead 
overtly. Similarly, we may identify ourselves with the 
righteous and heroic sufferer, and weep real tears at our 
imagined hard lot. The heroes and heroines as well as 
their experiences may change constantly or, doubtless less 
frequently, we may persistently identify ourselves with 
a real or represented character, following his achieve- 
ments in great detail. The réle of the finest character or 
the greatest rogue, the most applauded or the most chas- 
tised, may be the object of identification and thus lived 
in imagination with great satisfaction. 
Within limits, and properly controlled, the play of 
imagination or identification is productive of little harm, 
while providing much satisfaction. The student, strug- 
gling without time or means for immediate gratification 
of his impulses, is comforted by the vision of wealth, 
power, and approval that he may some day attain. The 
introversions should be of the right sort, however. Imag- 
inary achievements as a rule, if not invariably, are more 
wholesome than imaginary grievances. One may get 
along very well on imaginary power but not very well on 
‘imaginary food. Fancy must not disregard fact nor 
become a substitute for action. It is in this possibility 
of imagining fine adjustment while achieving none that 
danger lies.

Typss or RATIONALIZATION. 
Mental adjustments may also take the form of ration- 
alization although irrationalization would be the more 
descriptive if less commonly used term. Rationalization 
is a form of thinking or reasoning, that is, of sifting data, 
in which our personal desires are selective factors which 
guarantee an agreeable conclusion. Ideally, reasoning is 
the process of impartial manipulation of the evidence to 
achieve the logical conclusion, however disastrous the 
result may be to our own wishes. Rationalization means 
more or less complete blindness to all evidence except 
what furthers our side of the case. In every-day life this 
irrational process is often so subtle as to leave us ob- 
livious of its existence. 
The Réle of the Main Impulses in Rationalization.— 
A middle-aged man with a wife and family buys a hand- 
some automobile. His older and more sagacious uncle, 
paying a visit, questions his motives in this purchase: 
“Tt seems to me,” he says, “that you need furniture, a 
new fence, a fund for sending your children through col- 
lege, a nest-egg for emergencies, more than you need this 
machine.” But the buyer has a ready defense. “Well, 
my wife hasn’t been any too well and I thought that a 
little week-end trip now and then would do her a lot of 
good. And a busines man must have some recreation, 
you know! Then the children. They caught so many 
colds last winter because they got wet going to school’”— 
and so on with other “reasons.” Now, what were the real 
motives? Perhaps the fact that other neighbors had 
cars which were veritable badges of greater business suc- 
cess. Perhaps driving a big machine appealed to the 
urge of self-assertion. Perhaps the approval of onlook-
-P-A-G-E-276
ee re re meh Lar e 
260 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
ers was the object sought. Observe the motives to which 
advertisements of high-class cars appeal! 
The real motives often lie deeper than those we give, 
and what is equally significant, we often do not ourselves 
appreciate just what they are. Rationalization is a subtle 
process; it provides acceptable reasons while concealing 
the fundamental motive. The most effective temptations 
are those which come in disguise. If we are inclined to 
take the afternoon off for golf, while really aware that we 
should work, we at once obscure the real issue by ration- 
alization, by camouflaging the unworthy impulses. The 
student says to himself, “I have been working hard; I 
deserve a rest; I must be careful of my: health; a little 
recreation will double my capacity tomorrow.” And the 
next morning, to justify faith in himself, the student 
rationalizes the sore muscles and aching back as symp- 
toms of renewed strength and vigor; or the excessive 
fatigue as evidence that exercise was sadly needed. These 
excuses and explanations are as persuasive as they are 
irrational. 
Projection.—Failure to secure mastery, social approval, 
or to satisfy other strong urges may be partly averted by 
a form of rationalization called projection. There is a 
universal impulsion to project the trouble to some cause 
other than our own deficiency. If, while groping our way 
across the room in the darkness, we thump our shin on a 
footstool (due to our own forgetfulness), our immediate 
impulse and not infrequent act is to reproach the footstool 
rather than ourselves. Missing a stroke in tennis, we 
look inquiringly at the racket, ball, or net. The clumsy 
carpenter accuses his tools. If we fail in an examination, 
the questions were unfair. If one is a slave to alcohol, 
the taste was inherited from his father. If a man sins, it 
was because he was irresistibly tempted. If he amounts 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
DOMINANT URGES IN HABIT FORMATION 261 
to nothing, it was because he did not have a chance. 
There was once a man who exclaimed when his careless- 
ness resulted in the burning of his home: “It was the 
Lord’s will.” 
By projection we escape the annoyingness consequent 
upon the admission of our failures and deficiencies. The 
chronic alcoholic, notorious for projecting the cause of 
his downfall, affords an example of this mechanism. It 
would be most painful to admit that one is not only a 
worthless drunkard but also the cause of untold suffering 
to one’s wife and family. The chronic drinker, finding it 
impossible to give up the liquor, casts about, like the cat 
in the box, for some means of escaping these unendurable 
thoughts. Perhaps, some time as he arrives at home in- 
toxicated, the wife indignantly drives him out of the 
house. Thinking the matter over at the corner saloon, it 
occurs to him that he would not be drinking now were it 
not for his wife. This affords a crumb of comfort. He 
broods over this and other real or imagined events until 
he has convinced himself that his wife has been, even 
from the beginning, the cause of his downfall. That 
these delusions free him from responsibility not only for 
his own ruin but for the sufferings of his family is motive 
enough for clinging to them tenaciously. : 
The “Sour Grapes” Mechanism.—As the fable goes, a 
fox, after many vain efforts to secure an attractive bunch 
of grapes, preserves his pride and assuages his appetite 
by declaring that the grapes were sour; quite unfit for 
consumption by one of his caliber. This portrays a com- 
mon method of human adjustment, a tendency to mini- 
mize or deny. the desirability of the ends sought. If we 
lose our job through inefficiency we convince ourselves 
that the loss was a blessing in disguise. If we find master- 
fulness difficult to attain, we may say that more than  
-P-A-G-E-278
  262 . ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
anything else we despise pretentiousness. Being poor, we 
assert that money is the root of all evil. Unfit for or 
unsuccessful in marriage, we declare wedded life a failure. 
A rather general belief in compensation among human 
abilities has arisen from this tendency—a conviction that 
people extraordinarily competent along one line must be 
deficient in another. If the other fellow learns rapidly 
he will retain poorly. The pretty girl has little sense. 
The highly intelligent are nervous, unstable or physically 
inferior. All of these generalizations are, in fact, incorrect 
and thus disclose the more clearly this unique human 
tendency. 
The Converse of the “Sour Grapes” Mechanism.—A 
fox finding none but sour grapes declares that they are 
just the kind for which he had been searching. And so, 
Pollyanna finds that no matter what the calamity, one 
ought really to be pleased because it might have been 
worse. \Living in a hovel, we declare it easier to keep 
tidy and much more comfortable than a big lonesome 
house. Lacking mastery, we find supreme virtues in 
meekness. 
The “sour grapes” mechanism and the Pollyanna forms 
of adjustment betray a weakness. To declare that really 
desirable achievements or rewards are.futile or depraving 
seldom uproots our wants, at least not those grounded in 
strong native trends. Furthermore, the fruits whose de- 
sirability was once denied later may fall within our grasp, 
whereupon we must either scorn them again or else lay 
ourselves open to the attack of inconsistency. 
Both forms of adjustment are negative—let things 
come as they will and make the best of them+rather than 
progressive. It is the adjustment of the inactive; the 
same old sour grapes are good enough. If they are really 
sour, it would be better to search elsewhere for sweeter
-P-A-G-E-279
  DOMINANT URGES IN HABIT FORMATION 263 
ones. It is the opposite extreme of adjustment tendency 
from the behavior of one who, finding a high wall in the 
path of his progress, attempts to go under it, or over it, 
or around it, and, all of these failing, goes around the 
world to come up on the other side. 
Prejudice and Logic-Tight Compartments.—_Systems 
of ideas developed by rationalizations of any type, be- 
liefs, superstitions, prejudices, grudges, or habits devel- 
oped in childhood or later often become so firmly 
established that they can scarcely be dislodged even in 
the face of substantial evidence that they are irrational, 
useless, or even harmful. Such acquired systems of re- 
sponse, impenetrable to logical attack, have been called 
logic-tight compartments. 
Among the milder forms of logie-tight compartments 
are our convictions of the superiority of our town or 
county, our college, or ourselves. Several investigations 
have shown a very usual tendency for people, even those 
of high intelligence and broad training, to overestimate 
their abilities and virtues and in particular for those who 
are generally regarded, for example, as decidedly snobbish 
or vulgar to be blind to the facts. It is easy to see that 
these erroneous beliefs are motivated by our instinctive 
desires. In various ways we may close our minds to the 
arguments which run counter to our desires and cherish 
those which favor them. In the course of time, these 
prejudices become fixed. 
We may have closed minds in various degrees, ranging 
from the slight distortion of facts required to provide a 
comforting explanation of failure in an examination, or 
that of a male clerical worker who may not himself see 
any relation between his fear of competition and his con- 
viction that “woman’s place is in the home” to the ex- 
treme type of the man who, while scrubbing the floor of
-P-A-G-E-280
264 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
the asylum, stops to tell you that he is a millionaire. 
While we would call the last a case of insanity and the 
first just a “natural feeling,” both are similar mechani- 
cally, differing mainly in the degree to which misinter- 
pretation is carried. The delusion of being a millionaire 
represents logic-tightness to a degree of absolute immu- 
nity to which the term dissociation is often applied. 
  DEFENSE AND Escape MECHANISMS. 
Psychologists and psychiatrists frequently classify as 
dissociations not only systems of ideas or prejudices but 
also bodily functions. A patient may be at times un- 
controllably nervous, hysterical or morbid; he may be 
weak, paralyzed in one part or another, blind or deaf; 
he may have pains, seizures, fainting or vomiting spells, 
dizziness or heart disorders. The term dissociation is 
here merely descriptive; it indicates that some function 
has been broken off from control of the “main” person- 
ality. What interests us in these cases is that, while not 
the product of rationalization as heretofore described, 
they are none the less acquired as the result of some 
motive and may persist as long as the incentive continues. 
The motive is rarely understood by the patient. The 
symptoms are the result of what is called a “defense 
mechanism” producing protection from some distasteful 
- or fearful task or condition or “escape mechanism” afford- 
ing an escape from some annoying or horrifying task or 
condition in which the patient finds himself. 
Samples of Defense Mechanisms.—A badly pampered 
young man of a somewhat unstable type began his career 
as an accountant. Before many weeks he was brought 
home complaining of severe pains in the eyes and in the 
right arm, which seemed partly paralyzed. Feeling bet- 
ter after a few days’ rest, he returned to his work, only to
-P-A-G-E-281
  DOMINANT URGES IN HABIT FORMATION 265 
find the attacks recurring. The significant thing about 
these symptoms is that they made his work in the office 
impossible. Actually, the young man found the tedious 
task at the desk, day in and day out, extremely boring, 
and the work deprived him of the freedom and comforts 
which home life had previously given. At the same time, 
he was naturally averse to quitting outright—that would 
offend his self-respect and bring the scorn of his friends 
as well. Perhaps, one aftefnoon the fatigue of eye and 
hand did become severe, providing an excuse for release 
from labor for the day. The next day, the same symptoms 
occurred in more severe form and, half frightened and yet 
half gratified, he was taken home. Not only did he thus 
escape the unpleasant work but the criticism of himself 
and of others as well. In fact, he reaps more sympathy, 
freedom, and general care than ever. 
Psychoneurotic Disorders Considered as Defense 
Mechanisms.—Many of the “psychoneurotic symptoms” 
of soldiers during the war (often called “shell-shock” im- 
properly since they frequently appeared in soldiers who 
never reached the front) were of the same general type, 
similarly occasioned. It should be observed first that the 
symptoms, such as paralyses of the arm, fainting spells, 
temporary blindness, vomiting, etc., provide “escape” 
from or a “defense” against arduous or dangerous military 
activities. It should be stressed again that such symp- © 
toms do not imply pure malingering; they are intentional, 
although motivated by human tendencies to seek safety 
and éase and avoid danger and hardship. They are as 
perplexing and unintelligible to the patient as to others, 
but they result, nevertheless, in “escape” and often bring 
unusual care, attention and sympathy. The remarkable, 
and yet wholly intelligible, thing was the rapid disap- 
pearance of the psychoneurotic disorders after the Armis- 
°   
 
-P-A-G-E-282
a 
266 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
tice was signed. The motivation, the incessant stimulus 
which kept them alive, was suddenly removed; and as 
subtly as the symptoms appeared in the face of war, they 
began to disappear with the certainty of peace. The 
symptoms were no longer a defense against the labors and 
danger of war but a prevention of exchanging the confine- 
ment of the hospital for the freedom of private life. Many 
of the symptoms disappeared abruptly, others slowly, still 
others like other unfortunatefabits were more persistent. 
Thus subtly is conduct guided and controlled by our 
fundamental urges. 
Susstitute ACTIVITIES OR COMPENSATIONS. 
The various forms of introversion and most of the 
forms of rationalization were mental adjustments to the 
situations which interfered with or inhibited the direct 
expression of native impulses. In one way or another 
some mental activity was substituted for overt action. 
More active adjustments may also be made even when 
the substituted activity is in most respects quite unlike 
the original form. For example, a man who has been 
enraged but who does not dare to give rein to his im- 
pulses to attack because of his fear of injury, or jail, or 
perhaps because he doesn’t believe in fighting, may sub- 
stitute an attack with words or looks, or he may control 
himself for a long time but may later vent his rage upon 
his wife or children. In the same way, a man of frail 
stature, failing to secure a feeling of mastery by his 
physique, substitutes (quite unwittingly, perhaps) a dig- 
nified gait and manner, or develops a loud, “masterful” 
voice, or a hard, even gaze. A woman, lacking beauty or 
wit, may, to secure approval, adopt gorgeous apparel or 
effect the élite in vocal expression. The unprepared 
sudent in writing his examination may compensate in 
9
-P-A-G-E-283
DOMINANT URGES IN HABIT FORMATION 267 
volume for what he lacks in facts. A man low in the 
scale of authority at his place of work, submissive to 
others throughout the day, may find a satisfactory com- 
pensation in ruling his wife and children with a stern and 
unrelenting will. 
Undesirable Compensations.—Substituted activities 
may be good or they may be bad; some are very bad 
indeed. That addiction to alcohol, heroin, morphine, or 
other drugs may be nee as compensations for 
thwarted desires or ways out of annoying situations, is a 
growing belief. Dr. Richard Cabot, Professor of Medi- 
cine in Harvard University, writes: “We hear a great deal 
of the physical craving for liquor. I do not believe there 
is any such thing except in the people who are in the 
middle of a drunk. A person who has slept it off... 
may well enough go back to it and of course he often does. 
But he does not go back from merely ‘physical’ craving, | 
but generally because he is bored or because he is blue or 
because he is restless.” That Dr. Cabot had in mind 
thwarted impulses or annoying conflicts from which alco- 
hol has provided an escape, is indicated in this further 
statement: “The alcoholic is helped, so far as he is helped 
at all, by getting at the reason why he started drinking 
and has continued to drink. Then if possible we try to 
find a stronger motive, a motive stronger than the thing 
that has driven him to drink and thus drive him out of 
drink.” 
More Desirable Compensations.—A substitute activ- 
ity, then, may get one into difficulties worse than the 
trouble which the activity aimed to relieve. But there 
are good as well as bad forms of compensation. If the 
maternal urges are thwarted, better than idle day dream- 
ing, or novel reading, or a pessimistic view of life, or 
“sour grapes” or a cheery indifference of the Pollyanna 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
rn emma 
268 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
type, better than some silly or harmful compensatory 
activity, would be the substitution of some social, reli- 
gious, or educational work. For the fighting, hunting, 
dominating impulses of youth, vigorous athletic games 
may be substituted. When angered, instead of holding 
a grudge, or inflicting damage on the offender in fancy, 
or working off the impulses by verbal attack upon in- 
offensive persons, we might attack the woodpile. A man 
who had lost his wife and children, in a terrible calamity, 
instead of avoiding the anguish by way of delusions, or 
liquor, or giving up to a wounded-hero type of self-pity, 
plunged more deeply than ever into his work and so 
instead of becoming a “ne’er-do-well,” a drunkard, or a 
pessimist, became a very eminent soldier. Of all the 
methods of adjustment to the thwarting of our funda- 
mental impulsions, the substitution of some wholesome 
but vigorous activity, while not always the easiest to 
arrange, is by far the best. When the lives of men are 
deeply searched, great achievements are found in lines of 
activity which began as substitutes for some other interest 
that was thwarted. 
REPRESSION AND THE UNCONSCIOUS. 
In the writings of Freud and many other exponents of 
the “psycho-analytic” schools, the term “repression” into 
the “unconscious” or “subconscious” appears extensively. 
According to many of these writers, repression is con- 
ceived as a subtle mechanism by which many thwarting 
or painful ideas or “conflicts” or impulses under taboo 
may be temporarily avoided by banishment from con~ 
sciousness. Sex impulses (which the Freudians find to be 
most numerous) may arise in forms tabooed by our ideals 
or training. We cannot allow these impulses to be 
expressed directly or even by day-dreaming ete realiza- 
>
-P-A-G-E-285
DOMINANT URGES IN HABIT FORMATION 269 
tion. Attempts to rob them of their attractiveness by 
some form of rationalization, by the sour-grapes mechan- 
ism, for example, may fail. What we may do, accordihg 
to the Freudians, is to relegate them actively into the 
subconscious; that is, to repress them. Once submerged 
in this lower region, they become unconscious—we be- 
come unaware of their existence—but though buried they 
are really buried alive. Still active, they may express 
themselves in some indirect way, often in most mischiev- 
ous ways. They may come out during dreams—a time 
when our inhibitions are at a low ebb—in some symbolic 
or even direct form/ During waking hours, the repressed 
ideas or impulses are more closely guarded by the “cen- 
sor,’ that is, by our ordinary taboos and inhibitions. 
Their appearance then must be very deceptive; conse- 
quently they take the form of headache, nervousness, 
fears, forgetfulness, pains, paralysis, or stuttering»y Even 
slips of speech or writing, difficulties in recalling a name, 
perseveration of a tune, or giggling are ways in which 
repressed impulses are satisfied. Many nervous disorders, 
it is said, are occasioned by these unconscious ideas and 
impulses. Such symptoms are unconscious motives in 
disguise. 
When explained in detail, the Freudian concepts are 
fascinating and often convincing. Yet they have not met 
with approval in most scientific, especially psychological, 
circles. The trouble is that while they fit in well with 
popular notions, the concepts are really scientifically 
unsound. 
The Unconscious and Subconscious Ideas.—There 
may be, in the body, activities which are unconscious; 
that is, activities which arouse no sensations. Our diges- 
tive processes may be going on, active yet unconscious. 
The seat of consciousness is, of course, the brain and not 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  270 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
the stomach. Unless the motor and glandular activities, 
through sensory nerves, arouse to activity certain neural 
mechanisms in the brain the digestive processes arouse 
no sensations, that is, they do not become conscious. The 
trouble begins when it is assumed that the sensations 
from the stomach, even if not experienced as conscious, 
nevertheless actually exist somewhere, namely, in the un- 
conscious. The fact is that unless they are conscious they 
do not exist at all—in the subconscious mind, in the 
brain, or in any other place, any more than words exist 
as things in the vocal organs when these organs are in- 
active. “Where,” it is asked, “is a memory or idea when 
it is not conscious? Where is the idea of my birthplace 
when I am not thinking of it? Is it not still a genuine, 
live idea although not in the region which we call con- 
sciousness? Given a chance, will it not leap out of the 
unconscious into full consciousness? Is this not the 
process of recollection?” Now this doctrine is as perverse 
asit issimple. Memories and ideas are not things, which 
must always exist somewhere. They are merely conscious 
responses to appropriate stimulation just as movements 
are muscular responses to stimuli. We do not say that a 
movement is something actually existing but concealed in 
a muscle, from which it emerges when activated and to 
which it returns during inactivity. What we say is that 
a mechanism, the muscle, when properly stimulated by 
means of a nerve impulse, is thrown into action, with a 
movement as the result. During a period of inactivity, 
the muscle does not contain an actual movement; all 
that exists is the muscle with its nerve connections modi- 
fied as they have been by past exercise. Likewise, the 
physical basis of conscious recall is assumed to be a group 
of cortical mechanisms similarly conditioned by past ex- 
ercise and thrown into action by stimuli. In sum, an 
.
-P-A-G-E-287
  
DOMINANT URGES IN HABIT FORMATION 271 
idea, memory, or impulse is like a motor response, in the 
sense that it isa reaction. It is retained in the same way 
that an acquired motor act is retained. Neither a move- 
ment nor an idea exists as such except when it is acti- 
vated; at other times, neither exists in the unconscious— 
it is simply inactive. 
Unconscious Impulses,—Impulses to eat, sleep or 
dominate are, like movements or ideas, due to reactions 
of certain mechanisms; and except when the mechanisms 
are active, the impulses do not exist. The impulse to 
eat, for example, is produced on occasions by organic 
conditions such as that of insufficient fuel in the system, 
or by outer stimuli such as the sight or smell of food, or 
—best—by both together. Readiness to eat does recur, 
not by popping out of the unconscious but as a reaction 
to organic or external stimuli. Similarly, the sex im- 
pulses are aroused by certain bodily conditions or by an 
external stimulus or by both together. Impulses, like 
memories, are reactions; they exist only when active; at 
other times there is nothing except the mechanism on 
which they depend. When not in a state of activity, 
impulses do not actually exist as entities in the uncon- 
scious or in the mechanisms which give rise to them any 
more than snaps and pops exist, as such, in an inactive 
whip. 
These are really not trivial or academic “distinctions 
without a difference.” The Freudians, having gone 
astray because of the erroneous assumption that every 
one carries around with him a host of active entities in 
his unconscious, next assume that these hidden but un- 
cannily active—in fact, intelligent—beings disguise 
themselves and break out, causing slips of the tongue, 
dreams, fears, nervous disorders of the ‘various sorts 
which they find in their patients. There is a tremendous 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  272 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
difference between the Freudian statement that the ac- 
countant’s eye and arm disturbances (mentioned above) 
are due to the work of active entities from the uncon- 
scious and the explanation that these troubles were 
actually learned in much the same way that the cat learns, 
after many errors, to pull a string which opens the box 
in which it is confined. 
Inactive and Dimly Conscious vs. Unconscious 
Ideas.—This Freudian mechanism of avoiding unpleasant 
thoughts or impulses by actively pushing them into the 
region of the unconscious where they still exist and stir 
up trouble—psychoneurotic symptoms, for example—we 
cannot accept as true or useful. That we do attempt to 
avoid unpleasant thoughts and impulses is not denied but 
strongly affirmed. Mainly our efforts to forget are efforts 
to substitute another activity. A frequent device, when 
one thinks of some social blunder, or some undesirable 
impulse, is to begin to sing, write, read or do something 
else. We get the unpleasant idea out by getting another 
one in. The unpleasant thought or impulse may still per- 
sist in the background of consciousness and still influence 
our behavior as the dim awareness of an important event 
influences our activities and moods, or they may disappear 
entirely from consciousness. In the latter case, the ideas 
and impulses are merely inactive; they are not relegated 
to a different region where they still remain active in 
mysterious, not to say, fantastic ways. 
Summary with Certain Implications——The various 
typical ways by which man escapes the annoying situa- 
tion occasioned by the thwarting of native tendencies, by 
day-dreaming the activity, by “sour-graping” it, or by 
pretending that the annoyingness is really satisfying, by 
rationalizing an excuse for the indulgence, or by substi- 
tuting some other activity, good or bad—all of these are 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  DOMINANT URGES IN HABIT FORMATION 273 
acquired adjustments. They are learned reactions, just 
as speaking English, fearing the plague, or cracking nuts 
are learned reactions or habits. To say that they are 
learned is by no means to say that they are understood. 
Just why or how, and often when, he learned to enjoy 
stories of travel, to whistle or to count, generally is not 
understood by the learner, nor does he usually know with 
any definiteness how he now whistles or counts. The 
purpose of this chapter has been to present in general 
terms a number of acquired adjustments to annoying 
situations provoked by the hampering or thwarting of 
fundamental tendencies to action; and to illustrate the 
fact that many habits are formed in the service of the 
dominant impulses. The detailed processes involved in 
learning or habit formation remain for later chapters 
and in none of them will it be found necessary to invoke 
the use of uncanny subconscious or unconscious entities 
or mystic powers of any sort. 
RemepiaL Muasures anp “Curss.” 
The Prevalence of Psychoneurotic Ailments.—That 
our adjustments to difficulties are both good and bad, 
that they vary from mild and quite harmless habits to 
most severe “psychoneurotic symptoms” has been stated. 
Not infrequently the unfortunate defense mechanisms or 
compensations, excessive introversion or other adjust- 
ments are such as to interfere with normal contented 
living. The victim believes he is ill, as indeed he is, but 
the illness is the realm of general behavior and is not 
a disease in the ordinary medical sense. It is said to be 
a “functional” or “nervous” rather than an “organic” 
disturbance. It is often severe enough to cause the victim 
to search for expert advice or aid. “Half of any general 
(medical) practitioner’s ordinary work,” writes Dr. 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
ee Re en eenremerm e he Pennoni me nee 
274 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Richard Cabot, “is concerned with some type of psycho- 
neurosis; not half that the neurologists do, but half that 
all of the doctors in the country are doing today, is to 
treat psychoneurotics. That is important in many ways. 
It seems to me most important, because very few of the 
doctors have ever been trained to treat a psychoneurotic; 
very few have an interest in it. The attitude of many a 
doctor is expressed by his desire to run out of the side 
door when one of these patients appears at the front. He 
hates them, but cannot afford to show it.” By this state- 
ment of an eminent physician, two facts are implied: 
Disturbances in behavior generally of a character serious 
enough to occasion a visit to a doctor are as numerous as 
organic disease and treatment by ordinary physical meas- 
ures are apparently of little value. 
How Such Ailments Are “Cured.”—The histories both 
of medicine and charlatanism are filled with stories of 
“cures,” supposedly of disease, but really of psychoneu- 
rotic symptoms or ailments. The psychoneurotic soldiers, 
above mentioned, were “cured” when the conditions sur- 
rounding their symptoms were altered, when the motives 
were removed or reversed. Usually the “cure” was 
effected only after some “treatment.” What the treat- 
ment should be would vary with the individual; for some 
a strong electric shock, for others exposure to complicated 
apparatus, for others drugs, for others suggestion or a 4 
heart-to-heart talk. The “treatment” was really but a 
stimulus to arouse a change about to occur, a mere signal 
to move in a new direction. All down the ages this has 
been true; marvelous “cures,” one after another, are 
given the credit for the change fundamentally due to a 
shift in motivation. 
The Varieties of “Cures.”—The main requirement in 
such a cure is that it shall be notable or novel or nasty.  
-P-A-G-E-291
- 
  DOMINANT URGES IN HABIT FORMATION 275 
Cures by legions have been effected by. notable person- 
ages, novel appliances and nasty nostrums. Valentine 
Greatrakes in the seventeenth century by the laying on 
of hands, Pfarrer Gassner in the eighteenth by word of 
mouth, Phineas Quimby of the nineteenth by his “mag- 
netic eyes” and strokings, Emile Coué of our day by 
suggestion and incantation have “cured” hundreds or 
thousands of the typical psychoneurotic symptoms— 
pains, lameness, contractions, dumbness and so on. Less 
eminent curers were effective, too, on a smaller scale, 
such as the traveling “doctor,” who has long been with 
us. Uncle Henry describes him thus for Colliers: “The 
doctor I remember best was Professor Hieronymus—vital 
healin’, he called it. No knife, no medicine nor nothing. 
Why, magnetism poured out of him like sap out of a 
sugar maple. For $2 he’d take plain tissue paper between 
his palms and vitalize it, an’ all you had to do to keep 
well was just pin it on your night shirt at the back over 
the great nerve center of the human body.” Before his 
day primitive tribes had their “medicine man.” 
Similarly effective has been the use of mechanical ap- 
pliances; in which novelty, something new or mysterious, 
is of prime value. Thus when the first inklings of electric 
forces began to flow, magic “tractors” (sometimes made 
of wood), electric belts, batteries, and especially highly 
complicated and spectacular apparatus began to accom- 
plish cures. The blue glass craze, during which hundreds 
were supposed to have been cured of all sorts of ailments, 
was reputed to have originated in the humorous remark 
of a wag to a sufferer that blue glass should cure illness 
because the rays were “actinic.”’ Quite aside from their 
legitimate functions, X-rays, radium, plasters, chest- 
protectors—especially red ones—ete., etce., have been 
potent in relieving psychoneurotic symptoms. Drugs 
   
-P-A-G-E-292
  276 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
have been equally potent, especially nasty drugs—few 
have much confidence in a drug as bland as water. 
Theriac, of fame a century ago, made of a mixture of 
everything that tasted bad; asafcetida, of a bad odor, 
which many of us as children carried in a little bag hung 
round the neck with a string; strong bitters, stinging lina- 
ments, violent physics, repulsive lotions such as “skunk 
oil” or crushed vermin and patent nostrums of innumer- 
able sorts have in their time rendered “cures.” 
The Essence of the “Cure.”—These cures are possible 
because at almost any time a goodly number of the cases 
of psychoneuroses have been relieved of the motive re- 
sponsible for their symptoms. Being ready for the cure, 
almost anything which has a wide and startling repute 
may appear to affect the cure. Where the incentives of 
the symptoms still persist, patients are rarely cured, at 
least permanently, but given the moment when the 
symptoms have lost their function, conditions are ripe 
for a cure. In these moments it is better to be the sub- 
ject of a marvelous new cure than merely to throw away 
the crutches and walk; the latter may arouse suspicion 
whereas the former carries with it considerable prestige. 
Because of these facts, there is wisdom and justice in 
the coolness with which men of science view the numerous 
new types of mental cures. The mere fact that apparent 
cures, even apparently marvelous ones, are wrought is by 
no means convincing evidence of intrinsic merit. Many 
of the forms of psychoanalysis, Couéism and other cults, 
have yet to demonstrate their fundamental validity. 
They may remove symptoms without effecting a real cure. 
Real Cure a Psychological and Educational Problem. 
—For all types of distorted personalities, the chronic 
introvert, the sour-graper, the rationalizer, the closed- 
mind, the subject of unfortunate compensations or de-

  DOMINANT URGES IN HABIT FORMATION 277 
fense mechanisms, in degrees mild or extreme, the best 
remedial treatment consists in reéducation. As principles 
of guidance in reéducation, Dr. Shepherd Ivory Franz, 
eminent authority in this field, mentions five require- 
ments: 
1. The nature of the abnormality, particularly of the 
i incentives and history, must be specifically 
* known. 
2. The patient should be given to understand as well 
as may be the cause, nature and history of his 
difficulty. 
3. The patient must wish to get well, his environment 
and mental attitudes must be so changed or 
modified that he will wish to get well. 
4. The patient must achieve confidence, that he can 
and will get well. 
5. Beyond these, there must be carried out special 
steps in reéducation, “not hit or miss,” but 
adapted to the patient’s special mental condi- 
tion, to his previous education, and to the en- 
vironment in which he has to live, so that he may 
carry out his life work in the community as part 
of it. : 
Study of many of the “cures” and new cults disclose 
that in one way or another they satisfy one or more, but 
rarely all, of these conditions. To cure completely, treat- 
ment must include all of these steps. 
PREVENTATIVE MEASURE. 
As in other fields of service to ailing humanity, pre- 
vention is preferred to cure, education to reéducation. 
How shall we avoid developing undesirable habits of the 
» kinds here listed and others? One thing we may do is to 
become familiar with the ways which are right and 
wrong. We should, then, understand as well as we may 
the tendencies to idle dreaming, self-pity, rationalization,
-P-A-G-E-294
278 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
not only in general, but our particular susceptibilities and 
the conditions under which undesirable reactions are most 
likely to occur. But mere knowledge of what not to do, 
indeed, knowledge of just what to do, is insufficient. 
Habits of holding our mental adjustments within proper 
limits, of thinking impersonally, of compensating wisely, 
these in numerous particular forms to meet a multitude 
of specific difficulties must be acquired. 
The “moral” of this discussion is contained in a quota- 
tion from William James’s famous chapter on Habit: 
“The hell to be endured hereafter, of which theology tells, 
is no worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this 
world by habitually fashioning our characters in the 
wrong way.” “The great thing, then, in all education, is 
to make our nervous systems our ally instead of our 
enemy. . .. We must make automatic and habitual, as 
early as possible, as many useful actions as we can, and 
guard against the growing into ways that are likely to be 
disadvantageous to us, as we should guard against the 
plague.” F

CHAPTER X 
THE GENERAL LAWS OF LEARNING 
In the preceding chapters, several facts were observed 
which bear upon the nature of learning. In the discus- 
sion of the connecting mechanism we noted the tremen-: 
dous complexity of neurones, particularly those in the 
brain, which are concerned in learning. We observed 
that, between sense organ and reacting mechanisms were 
series of neural connections offering innumerable possible 
pathways but that the nerve impulse usually takes some 
limited course. The limiting conditions were found in 
the synaptic connections, some of which were “open,” 
some of which were “closed.” To acquire new reactions 
means to change these conditions at the synapses, to 
change the effective connections. In a later chapter we 
noted the fact that such neural changes are possible, as 
a result of our original nature. For this reason, it was 
said that the capacity to learn is a native trait. In the 
last chapter were given illustrations of some of the * 
dynamic factors in learning, with special emphasis on the 
réle of the main urges, likes and dislikes in initiating and 
subtly controlling learning. The importance of proper 
habit formation was also stressed. Learning and habit 
formation is adjustment to the conditions of life, but the 
kinds of adjustment we strive to make are determined at, 
first almost wholly and throughout life very largely by 
the character of our fundamental urges. We strive to 
avoid the annoying and to achieve the satisfying states 
of affairs, and in thus striving we learn; but what annoy 
281 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  282 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
and what satisfy are largely determined by a number of 
native and acquired cravings. This does not mean that 
the habits we form are specifically predetermined by our 
natures. On the contrary, many habits, both good and 
bad, may satisfy our cravings to some extent or fully 
and what is more, our main urges may be modified within 
limits, by proper training. The present chapter serves as 
an introduction to the principles to be observed in the 
task of training one’s self or others. First will be pre- 
sented certain very general laws of learning, principles 
which hold for every type of acquisition. These will be 
illustrated anew as we proceed to more detailed considera- 
tions and particular rules of economy in learning of 
various sorts. 
We Learn by Reacting.—Of prime importance is the 
first generalization, namely, that we learn by reacting. 
Learning takes place only during activity; it is never a 
passive process of absorption, but on the contrary a very 
active process of reacting. Acquisitions of the observa- 
tional or informational type, such as becoming familiar 
with a face, tree or building so that we can later recog- 
_ nize or recall it, or memorizing names and dates, the 
spelling of a word, or acquiring information during read- 
ing, like the acquisitions of movements and skills, are the 
result of reactivities. The same is true of learning to 
control one’s temper, or to appreciate music, art or litera- 
ture; all these are acquired in the process of reacting. In 
fact, what one learns are reactions; namely, those re- 
actions which, having once been made, are strengthened 
during further responses. 
S 
THe Law-or—Usn— 
The simplest form of learning consists in the strength- 
ening of native reactions. Exercise of any reaction—
-P-A-G-E-299
  1 je : 
THE GENERAL LAWS OF LEARNING 283 
walking, grasping, crying, laughing, becoming angry, sad, 
or joyous—other things being equal, tends to make that 
reaction more prompt, more certain, more easy. The 
use or exercise of any situation—response connection 
strengthens it; the stronger the connection the more - 
prompt, easy, and certain the response. The use of a 
connection unit (series of neurones) brings about certain 
changes, mainly in the synapses, which makes the passage 
of the nerve impulse more rapid, easy, and complete. 
This is what is meant by increasing the strength of the 
connection between a stimulus and a response. Such 
modifiability of nervous structure is a native capacity 
which may be expressed by the Law of Modification by 
Exercise, or more simply, the Law_af Use. It may be 
stated as follows: Whenever a modifiable connection be- 
tween a situation and a response is exercised, other things 
being equal, the strength of that connection is increased. 
. The Law of Frequency.—The Law of Use ‘expresses 
a basal fact, one that is needed to explain learning of 
every kind, A necessary correlate of this law is the fact 
that exercise up to a certain physiological limit is cumu- 
lative in effect. If-one response strengthens the connec- 
tion somewhat, then two responses have greater effect 
than one, three greater than two, and so on. Conse- 
quently, other things being equal, the more frequently a 
connection has been exercised the stronger the connéc- 
tion. This is sometimes called the Law ‘of Frequency. 
¥ Fie Law_or_Disuss. 
Modifications in the nervous system produced by use, 
however, are not retained in completeness for unlimited 
time. The nervous changes brought about by disuse are, 
roughly speaking, comparable to those produced in a 
muscle. One may by exercise strengthen the muscle to
-P-A-G-E-300
284 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
a high degree of vigor, but the effects gradually disappear 
with disuse. The gradual forgetting of names, dates, or 
poetry, the gradual loss of skill in typewriting, drawing, 
singing, etc., when these functions are not revived by 
exercise, illustrate this fact. The Law of Disuse takes a 
place with the Law of Use as a well established principle. 
It may be stated as follows: When a modifiable connec- 
tion between a situation and a response is not exercised 
during a length of ti time, the strength of the connection is 
decreased. 
x he Law of Recency.—The deteriorations of connec- 
tions through disuse is a gradual process. One day of 
disuse causes some loss in the strength of a connection, 
two days.a little mare, and so on. The effect is cumula- 
tive, a fact often expressed in the correlative Law of 
Recency, which may be stated thus: Other things being 
equal, the more recent the exercise, the stronger the con- 
nection between the situation and response. 
While the strengthening effect of use is involved in all 
learning (the weakening effects of disuse being really a 
passive process), the acquisition of all complex functions 
such as writing, speech, swimming, reading, learning 
poetry, involves a great deal more than mere repetition 
of a number of native reactions. We do not have a 
feeble writing ability at the start, which by general ex- 
ercise is made more easy and secure. We have, rather, 
a very large number of very minute, specific reactions, 
each to a particular stimulus, many of which are already 
organized, loosely or firmly, into acts. In the process of 
learning, some of these are selected and strengthened by 
use, others are disentangled and eliminated, to die out by 
disuse; others, possibly to be killed in some more active 
way. The acquired act of speaking a word, for example, 
is a compact bundle of specific connections between
-P-A-G-E-301
ae a i a a ER Moe 
THE GENERAL LAWS OF LEARNING 285 
minute stimuli and minute reactions, and before the con- 
nections are ‘selected, strengthened or weakened and 
properly fitted together, a tremendous amount of sorting 
must have been done. In actual learning, then, use and 
disuse operate upon very specific S-R connections. We 
do not practice one big writing or speaking reaction as we 
learn; we select and exercise, with varied vigor and for 
various lengths of time, hundreds of tiny constituent 
units. 
How Arze New Reactions Acqurrep? 
We learn by “hitting upon” a reaction and then exer- 
cising it; but how do we “hit upon” the desired reaction? 
When the child is first given a pencil, he grasps it much 
as he would seize any small stick; but in the course of 
time he will have acquired new muscular reactions to 
this object. How were these new responses achieved? 
How does it happen that the native or initial reactions, 
being well established and easy to make, do not continue 
to occur unerringly? If a child is afraid of thunder, how 
does he ever get rid of this reaction, since, according to 
the Law,of Use, the more he makes the fear reaction the 
more firmly it should become fixed. If he does conquer 
his fear of thunder, what has become of that reaction? 
, These are important matters that have been delib- 
erately neglected so far. We shall have to attempt an 
explanation, for the practical solution of many problems 
to be encountered later depends upon the answer to the 
question: How are new reactions acquired? 
Our equipment for explaining learning now consists of 
| the Law of Use (or Frequency), the Law of Disuse (or 
Recency), and a complex environment which provides 
specific stimuli in various combinations. We will proceed 
to examine representative types of learning, illustrating 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
286 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
the way in which these principles operate, going as far as 
possible without introducing additional laws. 
Many of the illustrations following are selected from 
experiments on animals as well as upon human subjects. 
It will be interesting and important to observe how ade- 
quately the main principles of learning apply to both. In 
keeping with the Law of Parsimony, we should seek to 
explain human learning as far as possible by the prin- 
ciples which hold for animal learning; science prefers few 
rather than many and simple rather than complex 
explanations. 
Tue AssociIaATION oF SIMULTANEOUS REACTIONS. 
New connections are established when two (or more) 
situations which elicit different but not mutually ex- 
clusive reactions are repeatedly presented simultaneously. 
When an object moves rapidly toward the eye, the native 
reaction is a wink; when the skin of the finger is stim- 
ulated with a slight electric shock the native response is 
a quick withdrawal of the hand. If the two stimuli are 
given at once the result is a simultaneous wink and jerk 
of the hand. If we continue, time after time; to give the 
two stimuli at once and.finally give only one—say the 
- electric shock—the probable result is that both the jerk 
of the hand and the wink will occur at once. Or, if we 
move the object rapidly toward the eye, both wink and 
jerk will occur. Here, then, is a clear case of acquisition ; 
we now have a combination of two responses to a situa- 
tion which previously gave us only one. Or, to say the 
same thing in another way, we have acquired new con- 
nections: one between the eye stimulus and the hand 
effectors, and another between the hand stimulus and the 
wink mechanism. New pathways through the nervous
-P-A-G-E-303
THE GENERAL LAWS OF LEARNING 287 
system have been opened up and strengthened by use 
(repetition) so that the nerve impulse flows through and 
produces a new reaction. | 
The Neural Basis of Associative Learning—A sig- La 
nificant feature of the nervous system is that it provides 
pathways from each receptor to a tremendous number, 
very likely, to all effectors (see pp. 66 f.). Of these innu- 
merable connections but few are strong enough to arouse 
the effectors as the result of ordinary stimulation; the 
others are “closed” in the sense of ordinarily producing 
no observable reaction. Actually, then, physical connec- 
tions between the eye stimulus and the hand muscles, as 
well as between the hand stimulus and the eyelid muscles 
must have been in existence to begin with. Let us call 
the stimulus, movement of the object toward the eye, S1, 
and the wink R1; the electric shock S2, and the with- 
drawal of the hand R2. The connections are pictured 
in the figure below. The heavy line indicates a strong

  connection, the dash line a weak connection. Although S1 - 
is actually connected with R2 it cannot alone arouse R2 
because the intervening pathway (mainly the synapses 
at y) offers too much resistance. When S2 is stimulated 
at the same time, the barriers at y are broken down so 
that the impulse from S1 gets through, discharging weakly 
at first, into R2, according to the principle of facilitation 
(see Chapter III). By repetition of this combined stimu- 
lation, the impulse from S1, according to the Law of Use, 
would break through more and more readily. In other 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
288 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
- words, the connection between S1 and R2 is gradually 
strengthened by use until S1 alone is capable of producing 
the response R2 as well as its original, R1. All of this is 
true of the S2-R1 connection also. 
Characteristics of Acquired Joint Reactions.—By the 
repeated associations of two situations which produce 
two harmonious (in the sense that both can occur at 
once) reactions, each stimulus becomes connected with 
both responses. To each has been attached a new re- 
action, in addition to the old one. The object-approach- 
ing-the-eye produces a jerk of the hand; the shock pro- 
duces a wink. Neither of these was made, until the 
“subliminal” connection (a connection too weak to elicit 
an actual response) had been strengthened by the com- 
bined exercise. Thereafter, either situation produces both 
responses; and according to the Law of Use, continually 
to administer one stimulus would further increase the 
strength of both connections, so that the combined re- 
sponse would occur more surely, promptly and easily. 
This raises the question as to whether both combinations 
are identical. No, they are not; for the reason that the 
connection of each stimulus with its old response always 
remains stronger. The object-approach-eye stimulus in- 
variably produces a combination in which the wink is 
more emphatic; the finger shock produces a combination 
in which the finger jerk is more pronounced. While the 
reactions in both cases include both wink and finger jerk, 
it is necessary to think of them as a joint reaction deter- 
_ mined by the strength of the particular connections be- 
tween the specific stimuli and the specific responses. The 
justification for this is seen most clearly if you fail to 
exercise one of the joint reactions for a while. Fail to 
apply the shock stimulus for a time and the wink unit of 
the combination may fail to occur,—it has died out from

Association of Motor Reactions——When a hungry 
kitten sees food it will run toware. it. If a child displays 
food, at the same time calling “itty, kitty,” a sufficient 
number of times, the kitten wii eventually respond to 
the call alone. When we are | reaking a horse, it does 
not, of course, respond in any y ay except by pricking up 
its ears when we say “Whoa We stop the horse by 
pulling on the bit and if, at the same time, we shout 
“Whoa,” and repeat sufficiently, the horse will stop 
eventually at the word. In both of these cases new con- 
nections have been acquired. In both cases, the old 
response to “Kitty, kitty” or to “Whoa” was mainly an 
awareness of the sound with but little motor response. 
These responses still persist but occur simultaneously 
with the new reactions, 7.e., running toward the call or 
stopping at “Whoa.” 
Association of Emotional Reactions.——Connections 
with glandular reactions, as well as with motor reactions, 
_ may be acquired in this way. To the stimulus, food in 
E c : ‘ , 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
  290 ‘ ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
the mouth, a dog responds by secretion of saliva. If at 
the time food is presented a bell is rung, the animal will, 
after sufficient trials, respond by the salivary reaction to 
the bell alone. It is in this way that the human mouth 
comes to “water” at the sight or smell of food, the sound 
of the dishes or, the dinner bell, or the mere thought of 
food. Very diffuse organic or emotional reactions may 
be attached to new stimuli in this way. A man who 
suffered actite nausea in a room which smelled strongly of 
camphor finds that later the odor of camphor tends to 
reinstate the sickness. After a long voyage, during which 
one has been seasick, the smell of ship or sea or the mere 
thought of them may turn one’s stomach in some degree. 
Similarly tears, mirth, affection, or minor likes and dis- 
likes may secure new attaches. In these instances, 
the reaction produced by the newly attached stimulus is 
not identical with the response produced by the original. 
It is merely a weakly aroused reaction of the same sort; 
weakly aroused since it would require a great deal of 
exercise to make the new connection as strong as the old. 
Association in Informational Learning.—Certain_ 
types of information are acquired by attachments of this 
sort. When shown a leaf, the child reacts by becoming 
aware of the object. If, while showing the object, one 
says the word “leaf” a nutnber of times, the child will, at 
length, think of the object when he hears the word alone. 
Thus he learns the meaning of the spoken word; for the 
word itself is merely a combination of auditory stimuli, 
of course, not in the least like the visual appearance of a 
leaf. Next, we may show the object (or say “leaf’’) 
while the child looks at the printed word leaf. With 
sufficient combined repetition, the child now thinks of 
the object when he sees the printed word. Later the ob- 
ject, a picture of the object, the spoken, written or printed   
 
-P-A-G-E-307
  THE GENERAL LAWS OF LEARNING 291 
word, may be coupled with the French words “la feuille” 
and the two together reacted to until he thinks of the 
object or, at least, something which stands for the object, 
when he sees the French words. 
Association in Perception.—In actual life, the simul- 
taneous stimuli are not invariably limited to two; indeed, 
the usual case includes many more, but the principle is 
the same. It is by the combination of many reactions, 
for example, that percepts are built up. When a child 
is first given an apple he makes a good many reactions to 
the many stimuli which the fruit provides. He becomes 
aware of its odor, of its color, of its shape, its weight, its 
taste, etc., by responding to the several olfactory, visual 
and other stimuli, simultaneously or in immediate suc- 
cession. The several responses become attached to each 
of the several stimuli and with frequent repetition of the 
experiences one stimulus alone may activate simul- 
taneously, to some degree, the several reactions. The 
apple is thus perceived when only seen or smelled or felt. 
We become at once aware of it as a combination of such 
and such tastes, odors, shape, weight, uses, cost, ete. An 
apple perceived through the sense of touch is not exactly 
the same as the percept of an apple smelled, tasted or 
seen. But the perceptual reaction is so quick, and our 
interest in it so practical, generally, that we do not ob- 
serve the fine differences. We simply become aware of an 
apple, neglecting the sensory and other minor details. 
The samples of learning so far considered are, of course, 
acquired by use, once the possibility of the exercise of the 
new connection is established. The inter-connections in 
the nervous system make possible limitless additions of 
connections; all that is needed, apparently, is simultane- 
ous presentation and exercise. If we can attach the wink 
reaction to a stimulus on the finger or the salivary reac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
      292 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
tion to the sound of a bell, it would appear that we can 
attach any stimulus to any response. So we may gen- 
eralize: By means of association and exercise any reaction 
which the organism can make may be attached to any 
situation to which the organism is sensitive. 
This is an important generalization; but should it be 
called a law and be put on a par with the Law of Use or 
Disuse? If we examine the facts closely it will appear 
that exercise is really doing the work. From the start 
there existed real but weak (subliminal) connections 
which were strengthened when the proper combination 
of the stimuli was provided. We have merely described 
the results of the operation of the Law of Use under cer- 
tain conditions; namely, when two (or more) stimuli 
leading to different but not mutually exclusive reactions 
are repeatedly presented together. 
Tue ELIMINATION OF CONNECTIONS BY SIMULTANEOUS 
. ASSOCIATION. 
Learning does not consist entirely of the strengthening © 
and consequent addition of effective connections. Weak- 
ening and elimination of connections already present is 
quite as important. A reaction may be eliminated by the 
simultaneous presentation of two (or more) stimuli 
which lead to mutually exclusive reactions. 
An Experiment with a Perch.—A minnow thrown into 
an aquarium with a hungry perch will be very promptly 
seized, since the former acts as a stimulus to one of the 
strongest of the latter’s native food-getting reactions. If 
a glass partition is placed dividing the aquarium into 
halves, the perch in attempting to seize a fhinnow thrown 
into the opposite compartment bumps into the trans- 
parent obstruction. On receiving the bump, the big fish
-P-A-G-E-309
THE GENERAL LAWS OF LEARNING 293 
turns about and swims to the edge of its compartment. 
Shortly, it darts at the minnow again only to be halted 
by the same punishment. It will suffer a good many 
bumps on the first day before giving up entirely, but on 
the next day fewer bumps are effective; and so on, until 
after about thirty days, instead of attacking, the perch 
swims off to the side or engages in other activity. The 
attack reaction has been, temporarily at least, eliminated. 
The bump not only blocked the old reaction but set up a 
turn-about-and-swim-away reaction which by simul- 
taneous association became attached to the old stimulus. 
When the perch now sees a minnow, the nerve impulse 
is shifted into the turn-away reaction. This may be 
shown in a diagram.

An Experiment with an Infant.—An infant while 
playing with some pets, which it fondled with pleasure, 
was frightened by a crashing noise. The child, of course, 
could not fondle the pets and at the same time withdraw 
in fear. The fear reaction, getting the right of way, put 
a stop to the caressing of the animal. The interesting 
thing about this case was that later when the child saw 
one of the pets he no longer approached it with pleasure 
but retreated in fear. This was not a combination of 
two reactions, but a selection of one reaction and elimina- 
tion of the other. The nerve impulse aroused by the 
sight of the animal has been shifted from its old course 
into another. The fear has been substituted for the 
fondling reaction. So far as the mechanism of association
-P-A-G-E-310
  
    294 “ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
is concerned, this case is quite like the previous one, as 
shown in the accompanying diagram. 
Before Exercise After Exercise 
‘Soe pete Approach Seepets - S77 and fondle Sz 
Hear noise <=» retreat in fear retreat in fear 
The elimination of the attack on the minnow by the 
perch might be explained by the simultaneous introduc- 
tion of a stimulus (the bump from the glass partition) 
which proves an effective block and which also sets up a 
mutually exclusive or “incongruous” reaction—the turn- 
away. In the case of the child who acquired a fear-and- 
retreat reaction on sight of the animals, there is scarcely 
a blocking of the original response of approach, although 
there is introduced an “incongruous” reaction. That is, 
the child cannot simultaneously approach-to-caress and 
withdraw in fear. The latter reaction wins out con- 
ceivably because it is stronger and by means of association 
becomes attached to the stimulus which originally led to 
the incompatible response of approaching-to-fondle. 
Elimination Without a Blocking.—Responses are 
eliminated, however, when no block or obstruction or 
other stimulus is present to set up an incongruous re- 
action. A famous experiment, performed by G. W. and 
E. G. Peckham, will serve as an illustration. These ob- 
servers found that a spider dropped hurriedly from its 
web at the sound of a tuning fork. When it had climbed 
back, a repetition of the stimulus produced ‘the same 
dropping reaction; but after eight or nine trials the stim- 
ulus suddenly lost its power; the spider failed to react by 
dropping from the web. Next day, however, the stimulus 
was effective for a time but failed after six or seven
-P-A-G-E-311
  THE GENERAL LAWS OF LEARNING 295 
repetitions, and after about ten days the dropping re- , 
action ceased entirely—at least for a time. In this ex- 
periment the spider’s reaction was in no way blocked; no 
pain was involved; no definite incongruous reaction was 
set up. The connection between the sound of the tuning 
fork and the response of dropping, which was at first 
prompt and certain, had been gradually stamped out. 
Limitations OF THE Laws or UsE AND Disuse. 
This is really a most curious matter. The dropping-to- 
the-ground reaction had been eliminated in the very 
process of exercise. According to the Law of Use, the 
tendency to drop at the sound of the tuning fork should 
have been strengthened; should have become more 
prompt and certain. Instead of that, it gradually became 
less prompt and certain, finally being eliminated entirely. 
This phenomenon might well bring the Law of Use 
under serious suspicion. This experiment, however, does 
not really discredit the Law of Use but portrays one of 
its limitations. Exercise is a true and faithful servant of 
learning, but it is unable to do all the work alone. In 
fact, all along we have been neglecting another and pos- 
sibly more powerful factor, one which we must shortly 
bring forward. Before so doing, it will be advisable to 
present a few more illustrations of the inadequacy of the 
Laws of Use and Disuse, in which the new factors, which 
contribute to the control of learning, are more clearly 
portrayed. 
Illustration from Study of Rats in a Maze.—For one 
investigation, a box was constructed in such a way as to 
offer to a rat placed in a certain compartment four dif- 
ferent avenues of escape, all of which led to food. The

electric shock as he passed; a second led to a similar com- 
partment, in which the rat was confined for twenty sec- 
onds before being permitted to proceed; a third led to a 
long pathway to be traversed before food was reached;

Rovres. In the actual experiment the compartments were rear- 
ranged for different groups of rats, i.e., for one group “confinement” 
would be situated on the left, for another in the second position, 
as pictured above, for another in the third position, and for an- 
other on the right. Thus no type of “effect” was given the con- 
ceivable advantage of a favorable position. Movable doors were 
also provided to force the rat in the direction desired after emerg- 
ing from the compartment. (After Kuo. Journal of Comparative 
Psychology, Feb., 1922.) 
and the fourth compartment provided a short pathway: 
directly to the food. The positions of the four little com- 
partments were so arranged that a particular rat, on his 
first trial, was as likely to enter one as another; so, by 
using a number of rats, it was possible to ascertain the
-P-A-G-E-313
  THE GENERAL LAWS OF LEARNING 297 
  factors which guided choice. Each of thirteen rats was 
given trials until it had finally selected and thoroughly 
learned one of the four ways. 
At first, a rat was as likely to take one way as another, 
with the result that in the first four trials each way to 
the food was practiced equally often, approximately. But 
soon all had given up the pathway which produced the 
shock. A little later all had refused the way which pro- 
duced the twenty seconds of confinement. The long way 
was eliminated more slowly; but finally all but two went 
by the short route. Now, by the Law of Use alone, an 
equal number should have learned permanently to go by 
each route, since each was chosen and exercised equally 
often at the beginning. But the fact was that the exer- 
cise which brought pain failed to be effective; the rats 
soon gave up that route. Practice of the route which 
brought confinement was more effective; but finally 
that route was eliminated by the whole group. Use of 
the round-about pathway was likewise insufficiently 
effective, since with the exception of two rats all gave it 
up, although they relinquished this pathway less 
promptly than they did the first two routes. 
Illustration from Behavior of Cats.—Another illustra- 
tion, similar in principle, may be more clear. Suppose 
that after five cats have been taught to come to the call 
of “Kitty, kitty,” each is called singly, and No. 1 is given 
food and later caressed, No. 2 is caressed only, No. 3 is 
totally disregarded, No. 4 is sprinkled gently with water, 
and No. 5 is douched with water. Assuming that all have 
just learned to respond to the call and that other condi- 
tions such as hunger, fatigue, the satisfaction occasioned 
by the activity under way at the time called, etc., are 
approximately equal, they should all learn to come more 
promptly and surely by virtue of exercise, as they are  
-P-A-G-E-314
298 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
  repeatedly called. But will they? Cat No. 1, which 
was fed and petted, will probably come more and more 
surely and promptly; No. 2, which was merely petted, 
will probably continue to come but not so promptly as 
No. 1; No. 3, which was entirely disregarded, will prob- 
ably continue to respond for a while, but less promptly 
and frequently, finally failing altogether; No. 4, which 
was sprinkled, will probably give it up more quickly 
than No. 3; and No. 5, which was douched, will probably 
very promptly show a failure to respond. 
The Influence of the Effect of a Reaction.—There is 
no doubt about it: influences other than exercise are at 
work here. Very potent influences they must be to 
nullify and augment the results of exercises as they do 
in the illustrations just given. Apparently there is some- 
thing about the effect which accompanies or follows an 
act that either reinforces or decreases the results of use 
or causes an animal to repeat the act in one case and 
avoid it in the other. Pain, confinement, the holding up 
of a tendency under way, futile or wasteful work all tend 
to stamp out the reactions which they accompany or 
follow. \ On the other hand, reactions which bring release 
from confinement or pain, which bring food, kindly treat- 
ment, or attention, are repeated and stamped in more 
rapidly than when they are exercised with an indifferent 
result.f It is the reaction which gratifies some strong 
urge, Which brings a satisfying state of affairs, absolute 
or relative, that is repeated and stamped in quickly 
during use. The more satisfying the resulting state the 
more surely the reaction will be repeated and the more 
quickly stamped in. On the other hand, those reactions 
which are avoided or are stamped out even during the 
process of exercise, are the ones which thwart some in- 
sistent urge, which, in other words, are accompanied or
-P-A-G-E-315
THE GENERAL LAWS OF LEARNING 299 
followed by annoying states of affairs or annoying effects. 
The fact that human beings as well as animals tend 
to repeat and learn those reactions which, broadly speak- 
ing, bring a satisfying state of affairs, whereas they tend 
to avoid, and therefore fail to repeat and learn those 
reactions which bring an annoying state of affairs might 
be illustrated at length. We shall give only a few typical 
examples. 
An infant lying in its crib is disregarded by its mother 
and her guest. Soon the child begins to ery and scream. 
The women rush to the baby, pick it up, fondle and pet 
it. Treatment highly satisfying to the child is thus 
associated with crying and screaming. Similar experi- 
ences follow on many occasions, and when the child has 
attained several years of age it still sets up a great racket 
if it is disregarded or uncomfortable. The tendency to 
cry and scream in such situations had been built up by 
the satisfaction of attention which it had always brought. 
One child, age eight, had developed a habit of persistent 
“begging” when its mother said “No” to its requests, 
whereas a neighboring child of the same age took “No” 
as final without further whining or whimpering. Both 
had in earlier years repeated their demands after the first 
“No,” but the mother of the first child, perhaps to avoid 
being bothered, frequently gave consent sooner or later, 
whereas the other mother did not change her decision. A 
child learned to usé a “naughty” word on the street be- 
cause it was taught and applauded by some “nice big 
boys,” but its use at home was stamped out because it 
brought a scolding, or perhaps better, total disregard. 
Attach satisfaction to any response and it will be learned; 
attach annoyance and it will drop out. 
The Nature of the “Effects” of Reactions.—The terms 
“satisfying” and “annoying” states of affairs were just 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
  300 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
used to indicate the general nature of the “effects” which 
accompany or follow reactions and greatly influence 
learning. In the case of the human subject, these effects 
are recognized as equivalent to the feelings, pleasantness 
and unpleasantness first described in Chapter VI. In. 
man the “satisfying” state of affairs is accompanied by 
the feeling of pleasantness; the “annoying” state of 
affairs by unpleasantness. The feelings, it will be re- 
called, are conscious states; they are due either to some 
organic reaction or to some subtle condition in the neu- 
rones—any neurones—themselves. In animals every- 
thing indicates that certain states of affairs are main- 
tained, cherished or sought quite like those which are 
pleasing to men and that others are avoided or rejected 
as the unpleasant states of affairs are by men. Can we 
say that animals experience feelings of pleasantness and 
unpleasantness like our own? We cannot, of course, 
since we are unable to delve into their conscious states. 
The terms satisfying and annoying states of affairs or 
effects have been used to cover observed positive and 
negative adjustments both in men and animals. When 
used, they do not necessarily imply the conscious feel- 
ings. In the case of humans, however, it is taken for 
granted that the satisfying effect is consciously experi- 
enced as pleasant, the annoying as unpleasant. Satis- 
fying and annoying are broader terms. 
Tue Law or EFrect. 
We now need a general statement to cover the observed 
facts concerning the influence of the effects of a response 
upon the individual’s future behavior. We need one or 
ore generalizations that will embrace the facts in a 
simple yet faithful way. The following statement seems
-P-A-G-E-317
THE GENERAL LAWS OF LEARNING 301 
to be satisfactory: The individual tends to repeat and 
learn quickly those reactions which are accompanied or 
followed by a satisfying state of affairs. The individual 
tends not to repeat or learn quickly those reactions which \ 
_ are accompanied or followed by an annoying state of 
affairs. These statements constitute the Law of Effect. 
How Satisfying and Annoying Effects Work.—The 
influence of the satisfying or annoying state of affairs 
may be that of a selective agent. When the individual 
is annoyed by a reaction, he tends to avoid that reaction 
in the future and consequently does not acquire the reac- 
tion through exercise. When the individual is satisfied, 
he is attracted rather than repelled by the stimulus; he 
tends to repeat the same reaction which is consequently 
stamped in or learned. It may be that the satisfying and 
annoying states of. affairs exert their influence entirely 
by way of the general orientation to approach-and- 
repeat in the one case and to avoid in the other. This 
explanation seems to be adequate to cover most, if not all, 
of the facts observed in experimental studies and in the 
activities of everyday life. 
Thorndike, in his pioneer work on animal learning, 
was led to ascribe more far-reaching effects to satisfac- 
tion and annoyance than a mere general orientation or 
selective tendency. He was inclined to believe that 
“satisfyingness” and “annoyingness” were intimatély as- 
sociated with the subtle changes in the neurones them- 
selves, which in one case intensify or further the effects 
of exercise and in the other reduce or nullify them. 
These hypotheses are contained in the following quota- 
tion: “When a modifiable connection between a situation 
and a response is made and is accompanied or followed 
by a satisfying state of affairs, its strength is increased: 
when made and accompanied or followed by an annoying  
-P-A-G-E-318
  302 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
state of affairs, its strength is decreased.”, That“is, the 
effects of exercise influence the neurones in the one case 
in a way favorable to strengthening the connections and 
in the other case in a way to weaken the connections. 
Just what the inner results of satisfyingness and annoy- 
ingness are is not as yet known. This fact cannot be 
urged against the theory, however, since there is similar 
lack of information concerning the neural changes 
brought about by use and disuse, whose efficacy is uni- 
versally admitted. 
While the precise mode of operation of satisfying and 
annoying states of affairs or effects is not known, there 
can be no doubt about the validity and necessity of the 
first generalization, namely, that individuals tend to re- 
peat and learn quickly those reactions which are accom- 
panied or followed by satisfaction or pleasantness; and 
they tend not to repeat those reactions which are accom- 
panied or followed by annoying states of affairs. or un- 
pleasantness. The effect of a reaction thus tends to 
determine what connections are acquired or eliminated. 
APPLICATIONS OF THE Law or Errsct. 
Illustrated \by the Perch Experiment.—A little more 
_ attention must be given to the matter of elimination of 
connections, now that we have the Law of Effect to 
apply, because it has some important implications for 
learning, particularly when we are dealing with very 
strong tendencies. Let us recall the experiment with 
the perch. When the perch received the bump on the 
nose he turned about and swam away. The annoying 
effect of the bump weakened the tendency to attack until 
finally, when the perch observed a minnow he turned 
away instead of attacking as before. The turn-away
-P-A-G-E-319

reaction has been substituted for attack, as shown in the 
accompanying diagram. 
Before Exercise After Exercise 
‘ af Approach See minnow 
‘See minnow ——7 and seize ee 
an turn away DOS 
Bump on-nose <—$<——> turn away 
What happens to the old reaction—that of attacking a 
minnow when it is seen? Since it is no longer being 
exercised, it is of course dying out, according to the 
Law of Disuse. But so strong a tendency as that of a 
fish to seize its food takes a long time to die out from 
mere disuse. Many acquired reactions, which are prob- 
ably less deeply imbedded in our nervous system, will 
scarcely die out from disuse in the course of a lifetime. 
If you could, by some miracle, refrain from saying, think- 
ing, or otherwise using your name, how long would it be 
before recall would be impossible? Certainly a very long 
time, probably more than fifty years. So the perch’s 
tendency to seize minnows is still in existence but, for 
the present, another reaction is taking its place, namely, 
the tendency to turn away—a reaction originally made 
to the bump on the nose but now made directly to the 
presence of the minnow. How long will this substitute 
reaction keep up? Just so long as it remains stronger 
than the other tendency. But actually in this experi- 
ment the perch gradually lost the turning-away reaction 
and went back to his old trick of seizing the minnows. 
Why? Because the substitute reaction, although exer- 
cised, produces no satisfying effect. On the contrary, it 
becomes annoying and thus its strength is reduced until 
the old reaction gets the upper hand. 
es  
-P-A-G-E-320
  304 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Illustrated by Human Behavior.—These facts may be 
illustrated by observation of human behavior. A child 
is natively self-assertive—so forward and boastful that 
the parent in an attempt to break his tendency demands, 
on each outbreak, that the child sit quietly and silently 
for five minutes. After this has been done several times, 
the situation which previously elicited a boastful out- 
break now tends to produce cautious remarks because 
of the effect of the earlier punishment. With no out- 
breaks, of course, goes no further punishment and as time 
goes on, the holding in of the impulse to boasting becomes 
annoying, until finally the old reaction breaks out again. 
One cure for it is further punishment; but there is an- 
other way of dealing with the situation, namely, by 
making the substitute reaction satisfying. 
If the perch, when it turned toward the side of the 
aquarium after the bump, had been given food and simi- 
larly rewarded on each succeeding instance, it would 
“eventually, on seeing a minnow, promptly turn to the 
side where it was fed. If the child had been greatly satis- 
fied by praise or some other reward whenever it refrained 
from unseemly self-assertion, the more modest reaction 
would have been gradually built up through exercise and 
effect where exercise alone might have failed. Here 
then is the essence of eliminating undesirable tendencies; 
start the desirable substitute reaction somehow, by pun- 
ishment if necessary, but build it up by making it 
satisfying. 
Forms of Satisfying and Annoying Influences.— 
Social disapproval, harmless deprivations, and other an- 
noyers may do as well as physical punishment. Any 
stimulus that will elicit the desired substitute reaction is — 
what is needed. For example, in attempting to “break” 
the child of fear and crying during thunderstorms, scold- 
ee Es 
cote ae
-P-A-G-E-321
THE GENERAL LAWS OF LEARNING 305 
ing, threats, or other punishments only make matters 
worse. Show an interest in the lightning, call attention 
to its novelty and beauty and thus substitute for the un- 
desirable reactions curious observation. When you get 
that, or some better substitute, reward it by praise. It 
is thus by the proper manipulation of satisfyers and 
annoyers as well as by practice that the course of learn- 
ing may be most effectively directed. 
How to Utilize Satisfying and Annoying Effects.— 
Two additional facts should be taken into account in 
utilizing satisfiers and annoyers. The first is that the 
effects of either become greater the more closely it is 
associated with the reaction in time. To be really effec- 
tive, satisfiers and annoyers must accompany the reac- 
tion or at least follow it promptly. If long delayed they 
may be ineffective or they may become attached to an 
entirely different reaction. The second fact is that satis- 
fiers and annoyers differ in degree or intensity and that 
the greater the intensity up to a certain limit, the greater 
the effect on learning. Food for a hungry cat is a more 
intense satisfier than petting; a bucket of water dashed 
on a cat is a more intense annoyer than a sprinkling. 
What states of affairs satisfy and what annoy human 
individuals was disclosed in a measure in the studies of 
the dominant human urges. 
SumMaRY 
1. Exercise always means reacting. 
2. Other things being equal, when a reaction is made 
to a stimulus the strength of the connection is increased. 
The increased strength is due to modification of the 
mechanisms, mainly the neurones involved. Increased 
strength of a connection makes the response more easy, 
prompt, and certain. This is the Law of Use. 
   
-P-A-G-E-322
306 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
3. Other things being equal, a period of disuse results 
in the weakening of the connection between the stimulus 
and the response. This is the Law of Disuse. 
4. Reactions which are accompanied or followed by a 
satisfying state of affairs are more likely to be repeated 
and, consequently, learned. It is possible also that satis- 
fying exercise strengthens the connection more rapidly 
than exercise alone. Reactions which are accompanied 
or followed by an annoying state of affairs are unlikely 
to be repeated and, consequently, unlikely to be learned. 
It is possible, moreover, that annoyingness tends directly 
to weaken the strength of connections, and thus to elimi- 
nate reactions. 
5. New S-R connections may be formed when two (or 
more) stimuli which elicit two (or more) compatible 
reactions are repeatedly given simultaneously. This is 
possible because exercise and effect strengthen connec- 
tions that were already in existence but were too weak 
to operate. Each stimulus may now produce both reac- 
tions, each with a degree of certainty and vigor that 
is dependent upon the strength of each particular 
connection. 
6. Annoyingness may result in the elimination of one 
or more existing connections. Thus, a cat which has 
learned to come to the call of “Kitty, kitty,” will eventu- 
ally fail to respond if it is punished or disregarded-when 
it does come. 
7. A connection may be’ mechanically eliminated (at 
least temporarily) when two stimuli, which lead to mu- 
tually exclusive reactions, are repeatedly given together. 
Thus a retreat reaction, which is set up when the perch, 
attacking a minnow, is bumped on the nose, may become 
attached to the old stimulus. Whether such a substitute 
reaction persists or not depends upon further exercise and 
effect. 
8. The most effective way of eliminating an undesira- 
ble response is somehow to set up a desirable substitute 
which, to be perpetuated, must be made more satisfying 
than the original undesirable reaction. .

CHAPTER XI 
CHARACTERISTICS OF HUMAN AND ANIMAL 
LEARNING IN COMPLEX FUNCTIONS 
Learning, as we observed in the preceding chapter, 
consists in the strengthening and weakening of connec- 
tions between situations and responses. When two or 
more stimuli operate at once, new connections may be 
formed in the sense of being strengthened from subliminal 
to functioning strength by means of exercise and effect, 
and old connections may be eliminated in the sense of 
being supplanted by new connections attached to the 
same situation. In general, then, all learning may be 
said to consist in the addition and subtraction of working 
S-R connections. The acquisition of any new complex 
is the result of a great many additions and subtractions 
of connections, and each change is brought about in the 
ways illustrated in the preceding chapter. 
Several conditions are neéded to provide a typical il- 
‘ lustration of complex learning. First, there must be 
some stimulus to arouse the organism to activity. The 
stimulus must either produce an annoying—situation 
which the animal attempts to avoid (hunger or confine- 
ment would be a sample) or an urge for or impulsion 
toward some consummatory reaction. Thus hunger, 
itself a response to a bodily condition, may arouse an urge 
to secure and eat food. These conditions are necessary, 
otherwise the animal would settle down comfortably 
with the result that nothing is learned. Second, the 
309 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  310 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
animal must be confronted by a complex situation com- 
prising many features (or stimuli) to which it may react. 
Third, the successful reactions, in the typical case of com- 
plex learning, must be not as yet habituated. With these 
conditions fulfilled, the operations of the Laws of Exer- 
cise and Effect may be observed, resulting, as they may, 
in the weakening or elimination of certain connections, 
the selection and strengthening of others and the com- 
bination of responses into various types of combined 
reactions. 
In this chapter several types of learning will be 
illustrated with some attention given to their similarities 
and differences; the learning of animals will be compared 
with that of man; and the amount, rate, limit, and per- 
manence of learning will be treated in a general way. 
TRIAL AND ACCIDENTAL SuCcESS IN LEARNING. 
Learning the Way Through a Maze.—If an animal 
can learn at all, it can learn its “way about.” A maze, 
consequently, is a useful device for studying learning. 
By using labyrinths of varied difficulty it is possible to 
get a rough measure of the learning capacity of different 
species. 
Usually, mere confinement in a maze is sufficient to 
arouse the animal to activity, but often food is added as 
an incentive; the animal is rewarded by finding food at 
the end of the correct. course. 
A worm, a small chick, or a turtle can master a simple 
maze; but a rat, which is able to learn fairly complex 
pathways, is more frequently used in experimental work. 
Placed in a maze, as shown in Figure 33, the rat begins 
to nose about cautiously. He explores here and there, 
sniffing at everything as he goes. A human subject 
would study the features encountered, with his eyes

> rather than his nose. After going into a blind alley, 
the rat explores it thoroughly before coming out. If it 
receives a slight electric shock on reaching the terminus 
of certain blind alleys, it scampers out and very likely 
moves on or possibly retraces its steps to the more fa-

miliar territory already covered. After a time, it will 
venture again, and perhaps after many errors eventually 
finds its way through the maze to the food box. During 
a second trial, the rat works its way through the maze 
cautiously as before, but with fewer entrances into blind 
alleys, especially those wherein the shocks were experi- 
enced. It takes many trials, the number depending in 
part on the complexity of the maze, before the rat, by

a gradual process of elimination of annoying errors and 
acquisition of satisfying correct reactions, is able to follow 
the proper course unerringly. The rat has now acquired 
a series of reactions which with reference to the features 
of the maze situation are new. So far as one can observe, 
the learning process consists of: 
(1) The making of reactions, native or previously ac- 
quired, to the features of the situation, z.e., old reactions 
which constitute the “trials” ; 
(2) The. gradual elimination of the annoying errors, 
i.e., the old or trial reactions which bring painful shocks 
or which end in failure to relieve the confinement; 
(3) The gradual stamping in of the reactions which 
were satisfying because they furthered the animal’s prog- 
ress toward escaping confinement and reaching food; 
(4) The linking together of the various successful 
reactions into what appears to be essentially a unit, 
embracing all of the several steps or constituent reactions. 
An outstanding characteristic of such learning is the 
great number of “trial” reactions and the numerous 
errors which occur before the animal hits upon the suc- 
cessful responses. The animal at first makes an enormous 
number of reactions, and the process of elimination and 
selection is gradual. Even when the correct series of 
steps have been made, trial and error are still found, 
sometimes of a sort too subtle to be readily observed. 
Tiny errors are still being made and eliminated; very 
minute improvements are constantly being achieved. 
The progress of learning is not steady; the number of 
errors made or the amount of time taken gives a zigzag 
curve of learning as illustrated in Figure 34. This type 
of learning is described most frequently as “trial and 
error” learning, but perhaps more adequately as learning 
by trial and accidental success.

student is given a maze to solve which is as difficult for 
his species as the one described is for rats, the general 
process of learning will be the same. Hunger or annoy- 
ance at confinement may not be re- 
eo quired to arouse his activity and thus

Fig. 34—A Corve or Learnine tHE Hampron Courr Maze (SHown IN

figures at the left indicates the time required for the trials, which 
are numbered along the base of the figure. (From Watson’s Be- 
havior, p. 211.) 
When he has completed the maze, several more trials are 
required to establish the new, successful reactions firmly. 
The general features of the learning of men and rats are 
thus the same; only in certain particulars do differences 
appear. 
The human learner makes good use of his vision, in 
which he is superior to the rat. If the human learner
-P-A-G-E-330
314 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
  is blindfolded, he is tremendously handicapped. Man < 
probably has some advantage in the modifiability and 
retentiveness of his nervous system, that is, any reaction 
made has a greater effect; it is “stamped in” or “stamped 
out” more readily. If he notices a sign on the right way 
or gets a shock in the blind alley, these experiences are 
retained better. The human learner also indulges to a 
greater extent in mental activity. By means of memory, 
he can represent or recall some of the situations and the 
responses which he made to them. Arriving at an inter- 
section of paths, some sign—the look of the place—may 
enable him to recall the alley and what he did in it at 
the last trial. Man, more than the animal or even the 
child, stands at the crossway and contemplates, and 
thus often saves energy, time, and errors. The animal 
and the child keep on the move and usually make more 
errors. But the memories or ideas of the man add noth- 
ing to the general character of the process. They are 
trials and may lead to error or success, just as the animal’s * 
actual movements do. The ideas are merely substitutes 
for actual observation and movement. 
A Comparison of Memorizing and Maze Learning.— 
Let us examine a case of learning in which overt bodily 
movements are but slightly involved; one which is mainly 
observation and recall, but otherwise similar to the maze 
experiment. Memorizing a series of “non-sense” words is 
a case in point. The subject is given, a series of twenty 
words like the following: 
nup, tib, nult, remp, zue, ralt, marb, selz, kib, curg, 
toq, sor, dit, quos, viz, pelm, rulb, onk, gat, arz. 
Such a list is by no means learned through sheer impres- 
sion, absorption, or repetition. While the learner may 
not always realize it, the process comprises false starts
-P-A-G-E-331
  HUMAN AND ANIMAL LEARNING 315 
’ and stops, errors, confusions, the addition of connections, 
elimination of connections—all of the features of learn- 
ing a maze. 
A typical attack by an efficient learner would be some- 
what like this: First, a reading of the series for purposes 
of general orientation; next, perhaps careful observation 
of the first and second syllables and possibly the last two 
—nearly always these are learned first. Then the whole 
series may be broken up into units or “feet.” The first 
foot may contain nup, tib, nult and be read with a rhythm 
such as followed by similar groupings. The first syl- 
lable in each of these groups may be observed with special 
eare. The learner may note and try to remember that 
the last word of the first group, nult, has four letters, and 
that it is followed by another, remp, with four letters. 
However, he may discard this when he finds that tib-nult 
may be combined into a word that sounds a little like a 
town he once visited, and this in turn may be discarded 
when he observes that nult almost rhymes with ralt, 
which occupies a similar metric position. A word like 
quos is thought of as “such a mouth full”; whereas viz 
is “buzzy” and dit is short and snappy. Selz is remem- 
bered because it is short for “seltzer.” Learners usually 
keep an active lookout for meaningful reactions and this 
is trial and error in its clearest form. Suppose, for ex- 
ample, that you see how many meaningful associations 
you can make with gip? Note how you try, one after an- 
other, a great many ideas—some satisfactory, others 
unsatisfactory. 
On the whole, memorizing a series of words, far from 
being a mere passive, mechanical process of repeating one 
syllable after another, is highly active—or reactive—and 
presents all of the features of other trial-and-error learn- 
ing. The good learner is actively observing and search-
-P-A-G-E-332
  $5 
  316 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
ing for clues. He tries reacting by possible meanings, 
possible sounds, possible combinations with other words, 
possible similarities or contrasts. Many of these are 
tried out only to be discarded; others are selected; and 
before the list is learned the path is strewn with discarded 
trials. What is finally learned may be called roughly a 
series of reactions, just as the trip through the maze was a 
series of reactions. 
In memorizing, just as in learning a maze, one attains 
the first successful trip through the series after many 
trials, and even with that achievement much remains to 
be learned by further practice. There are recurrences of 
difficulties and errors—the curve of learning is zigzag, like 
that of the rat’s in the maze. 
Trial and Error in Complex Learning, Typewriting. 
—Learning the way through a maze and memorizing a 
series of non-sense syllables are relatively short tasks, at 
least for human subjects, although it would be possible 
to make them so long and difficult as to require weeks of 
effort. Many of the more familiar functions such as 
reading, writing, drawing, singing, playing the violin, 
running the typewriter, diagnosing disease, writing 
poetry, ete., etc., require years of practice to achieve a 
high degree of proficiency. About the best illustration 
of the character of learning in such complex functions is 
afforded by studies of typewriting (as made by Book 
-=and others). 
If the subject learns by the touch method, he starts to 
work as follows: Looking at his copy, he finds the first 
word “what” and thinks of “w.” He now looks at a pic- 
ture of the keyboard, locates “w,” and then, finding a 
corresponding position on the actual keyboard (the let- 
ters of which are covered), he makes a stroke. The same 
procedure for “h” and “a” and “t.” After a time, the
-P-A-G-E-333
  
HUMAN AND ANIMAL LEARNING 317 
~ task of looking at the picture of the keyboard is elimi- 
r nated, first for a few and gradually for more letters. The 
process then is: see the word, think of the first letter, 
“w,” think of its position on the mental picture or repre- 
sentation of the keyboard, locate its position among the 
keys, and strike. The keyboard has been reacted to con- 
sciously (by observation) until it may be represented 
mentally; 7.e., it has been memorized. Of- course this is 
a gradual process so that prior to complete mastery there 
is an overlapping; some letters may be recalled, while 
others must be looked up. Needless to say, writing at 
this stage is very slow and errors are frequent. Shortly 
the learner finds that the mental image of the position 
of the keys is unnecessary for certain letters; they may 
be thought of as on the board. Later, it becomes un- 
necessary to think of the position of certain letters at all. 
Merely seeing the letter to be written acts as a stimulus 
to carry the hand and finger to the right spot. The 
elimination of the several mental steps results in a great 
saving of time, energy, and usually, of errors. While 
there has been great progress, however, in respect to the 
elimination of many useless acts and the perfecting of 
the finger work in striking the keys, the learner is still 
in the “letter stage,” making a particular complex reac- 
tion to each letter. 
Further eliminations and selections, almost too subtle 
to be observed by the experimenter or to be appreciated 
by the learner, result in a combined reaction to two let- 
ters. For example, when “what” is observed, the thought 
of the “wh” sets off two strokes as if they were a unit; 
the same for “at” and for other similar units that are 
frequently encountered. While this unification is spread- 
ing to less familiar combinations, longer units such as 
“are,” “The,” “ter”; and soon “they,” “ough,” and later
-P-A-G-E-334
  318 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
whole words or even phrases are written as integrated or ~ 
unified acts. The transitions to broader units are made 
at different stages for different words; the easier or more 
frequently used first, the more difficult or infrequent 
later. 
Meanwhile speed and accuracy have been steadily but , 
irregularly increasing. Numberless futile reactions have 
been discarded. At first the learner may grit his teeth, 
press the table with his knees—literally write all over. 
These reactions are gradually eliminated as are more 
subtle irrelevant errors which result in hitting too hard 
or too easy, in missing the: keys, or timing badly so that 
the keys clutter frequently. Periods of emotional upset, 
anger, chagrin, despair, disgust, great elation, and the like 
are very common at first, but are brought under control. 
In learning to typewrite, one must learn to adjust his 
emotional as well as his motor mechanisms to the situa- 
tion. The elimination of conscious reactions, actual 
thoughts or images of positions—particular letters, par- 
ticular movements—goes on similarly. In the expert 
stage there are, then, relatively few irrelevant reactions. 
All of the movements become integrated; that is, they 
become combined into what is essentially one complex 
action. Attention need be given only to one phase of 
the process and with increased mastery less and less atten- 
tion or only occasional attention is required.

Learning by Purely Mental Trial and Accidental 
Success.—In the illustrations given, the learning of ani- 
mals and man is about the same except that the human 
subject learns more rapidly, retains better, masters more 
complex functions, and utilizes to a much greater extent
-P-A-G-E-335
  HUMAN AND ANIMAL LEARNING 319 
ideas as a substitute for actual manipulation, walking or 
other motor responses. While not changing the funda- 
mental trial and error character of the learning process, 
the use of ideas, making “trial” reactions mentally in- 
stead of overtly, is of very great value usually. It is of 
_ value not merely because it saves time and energy, but 
for other reasons, some of which may be explained more 
intelligibly later. At this point, a few important advan- 
tages may be described. The first is the possibility of 
practicing in the entire absence of the situation. 
It is very characteristic of a man learning to drive an 
automobile, play cards, or build a house to keep on work- 
ing at it in “off hours” during the process. He recalls 
to mind the position of the gears, brake and throttle; 
mentally he turns on the ignition, adjusts the levers, 
shifts gears, turns corners, stops, backs and so on. He 
may picture his “hand” in cards, make plays, visualize 
the results; in building the house he mentally places the 
staircase here, the fireplace there and then contemplates 
the results from various angles. In these operations, he 
makes trials, detects errors and observes successes. It is 
an interesting armchair type of learning, tremendously 
labor-saving and by no means futile. One of the notable 
features is the possibility of getting down to essentials, of 
avoiding disturbing or irrelevant details. When actually 
driving the car, for example, obstructions in the road, 
the need of steering, disturbing bumps and fears inter- 
fere with concentration on shifting gears. Lying abed in 
the morning, one may get right down exclusively to the 
matter of shifting the gears, repeating the operation time 
after ‘time. Such practice really carries over to some 
extent but rarely fully. Mentally shifting gears clarifies 
the mode of procedure but does not increase specifically 
skill in the muscular operations. A fine move in cards,
-P-A-G-E-336
320 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
or “idea” about the position of the staircase in the 
house may be put into effect easily, but often we find that 
some essential has been overlooked, we forget the pos- 
sibility of some one being out of suit and “trumping” or 
the fact that the staircase position interferes with the 
  light inlet. Even so, mental trial-and-error learning is | 
of tremendous value in point of economy and efficiency, 
much more in some functions than in others. By virtue 
of these capacities, man has a great advantage over the 
animals that do not utilize ideas much if any. 
Learning by Observing Others Perform.—The human 
learner is often able to acquire methods of procedure and 
detect erroneous and successful moves by observing others 
perform. Take a knife, cut a piece of elm, strip the bark, 
make a few notches in the wood, replace the bark with a 
slit in it and a gust of air properly applied produces a 
whistle. A group of small boys having observed these 
operations could go and do likewise, although they often 
observe incompletely and wrongly or forget what they 
perceived. 
Animals seem almost never able to learn by observation 
the tricks they can readily learn by trial and error. In 
performing experiments on animals, one must be sure 
that the animal observes another’s performances, that it 
then attempts to learn, that it has not already learned 
and that it does not learn by pure trial and accidental 
success, that is, quite by himself without profiting by 
what is observed. Sometimes in these experiments the 
performance of the act is done by the experimenter, some- 
times by another animal that has mastered the act. The 
acts utilized are such as jumping up or down a series of 
steps, standing upright, clawing, pushing, pulling or peck- 
ing at a certain latch or button, using a T-shaped stick to 
rake in a piece of food, climbing to a perch from which {
-P-A-G-E-337
  HUMAN AND ANIMAL LEARNING 321 
food may be reached, using a stick to push food out of a. 
glass tube, reaching into a bottle to pull food out, etc. 
Nearly all animals show what, compared to the behavior 
of a bright child, appears to be astounding stupidity under 
such conditions. While there are a very few cases of 
learning, mainly among monkeys, chimpanzees and other: 
primates, which may have been due to observation, 
usually the animal profits nothing by observing a per- 
formance even ten or fifty times. Learning by observing 
a performance is rare even among the most intelligent. 
beasts. They must learn through the try-and-try-again 
process with little abridgment. While they may appear 
to be as observant as human beings, we may be certain 
that their observations are markedly less effective. At 
the most they seem to learn merely that such and such 
is the place to work, without learning perceptibly how to 
work. In the anecdotes of animal learning that most of 
us hear from time to time, what is alleged to be the learn- 
ing of an act by observation is really learning merely a 
place to work. 
Children and adults learn much by observing perform- 
ances by others and thus abridge the trial-and-error proc- 
ess considerably but rarely fully. If the act observed is 
very simple and within our motor, emotional or mental 
equipment at the time, we may be able to do it. If I clap: 
my hands—l, 2, 3 stop, 1, 2, 3 stop, ete., you observe the 
pattern of reactions that you can already make and you 
can at once duplicate them, since it is easy. But if I pat 
the top of my head rapidly with my left hand while rub- 
bing my abdomen slowly with a circular motion, you may 
observe precisely what to do yet be unable to do it. Now, 
reverse the hands. Patting the head with the right hand, 
while rubbing the abdomen with the left, while no harder 
to observe, it is much harder to do. Observing the skilled
-P-A-G-E-338
  322 » ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
pianists is of some value to the novice but by no means a 
substitute for trial-and-error learning. Furthermore, a 
person may observe how well another controls his anger 
at interference, his fear of thunder, his grief at mis- 
fortune and while often helpful in some measure, such 
observations are not enough to enable one to do the same. 
Similarly, observing skilled acts in tennis, boxing or 
drawing hundreds of times while often helpful is not 
alone sufficient. Learning by observation of a perform- 
ance is rather exclusively human. It is a valuable supple- 
mentation of, but by no means a complete substitute for, 
the trial-and-error procedure. ‘ 
Summary.—In sum, however more complex human 
learning may be than that of animals, the fundamental 
features are strengthen and addition, weakening and elim- 
ination of connections during the process of trial, error, 
and success. In addition to native advantages in rate of 
neural modification and retention, the human learner is 
more proficient because he can and does observe more 
and better the results of his trials and errors; because he 
can and does utilize more and in better ways, ideas de- 
veloped during observation; because he can and does 
recall these ideas in the absence of the things observed; 
because he can and does observe and profit by the per- 
formance of others.

Before undertaking a discussion of the means of learn-

rather than of the progress of learning as it might appear 
under ideal management and tuition. We shall take up 
first various features of the curve of learning, which gives 
a graphic picture of the amount, rate and limit of im- 
provement brought about by practice.

life are very complex, including many particular S-R 
connections. During the progress of learning, changes 
in the combination of connections are constantly going 
on. The final proficiency is not merely the performance 
at the beginning done more rapidly; it is a different per- 
formance. Curves of learning, consequently, portray the 
progress of improvement in a changing complex of con- 
nections. They do not picture the influence of exercise 
and effect upon a single neuron or even upon a constant 
group of S-R connections. 
Shape of Learning Curves.—The actual curves of 
learning, which are available in large numbers, are of 
‘ ®

various shapes. The forms are determined in part by the 
nature of the function itself and in part by the ability, 
methods of work, and previous training of the individual 
learner and the circumstances under which he works. 
There is no single or typical curve of improvement, but 
many different varieties of which a few representative 
samples are given in Figures 35 to 38, inclusive.

is learning better in the 
early stages; usually it 
means only that what is 
learned has greater effect upon the score. When one 
begins to typewrite, for example, searching out each 
individual letter makes the number of words written per 
minute very small. But to memorize the positions of a 
dozen of the most commonly used letters, which is not 
a very difficult task, increases the output greatly. When 
one has reached a speed of thirty words per minute most 
of the easy tricks have been mastered, and to secure an 
equal increase in the score demands the learning of a

  HUMAN AND ANIMAL LEARNING 325 
great many more difficult acts. If, on the other hand, we 
consider the number of new Latin words one can learn 
in a given unit of time, we shall probably find that it 
increases as practice goes on. This is due, mainly, to the 
fact that after one has mastered a number of roots, pre- 
fixes, rules, etc., it is an easy matter to pick up a dozen 
new words; the “new” words being, as a matter of fact, 
not wholly new but composed of one or more parts al- 
ready more or less familiar. This is generally the case in 
acquiring information; the more history, psychology, or 
mathematics one already knows, the easier it is to learn 
a new lesson. Such differences in functions result in 
different kinds of learning curves. 
The Physiological Limit—TIn the case of such skills 
as typing, writing, etc., an absolute limit of improvement 
is theoretically possible but practically almost never 
achieved. The physiological limit is that degree of abil- 
ity which a particular person cannot surpass because of 
absolute limits in the speed or complexity of motor or 
mental response. In running a hundred yards, jumping, 
tapping with a pencil, or other functions which depend 
upon sheer speed and force of muscular contraction with 
relatively little opportunity for developing new technique, 
the limit may be reached. But in complex performances 
such as typing, drawing, playing the piano, carpentry, or 
surgery it is very seldom reached. In acquiring informa- 
tion in any field—law, medicine, history—there is no 
physiological limit; there is always a possibility of learn- 
ing more, although there is a limit to the speed with 
which the items may be acquired. But in most functions 
which have been steadily practiced for years, such as 
writing, reading, shaving, opening envelopes, tying neck- 
ties, sorting cards, memorizing or studying, we are per- 
forming with a speed and efficiency far below our maxi-

Educational Psychology, Vol. II, p. 124, after Wells.) 
When any habit becomes fixed, it is invariably annoy- 
ing to disturb it. The prime condition of improvement is 
that the performance at the time be broken up and re- 
organized in better form, 7.e., on a higher level. Most. of 
us eased off in our learning of reading, writing, and many 
other school functions as soon as we safely could—perhaps 
in the fifth or sixth grade—and entrenched ourselves in 
a low level performance, from which we have never 
emerged. Few people know how rapidly they read or 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  HUMAN AND ANIMAL LEARNING 327 
write, how efficiently they memorize or solve arithmetic 
problems; few know when their improvement came to an 
end, or whether they have made any improvement in the 
last year or ten years. If you should now suddenly under- 
take to increase your speed of reading it would be found 
disturbing and perhaps unpleasant for a time, the in- 
evitable result of breaking up an old organization of 
habits to supplant them by new. But this is the only 
way in which more effective habits—perfectly comfort- 
able once habituated—are attained. 
Even in learning under experimental conditions, in 
which the incentives to improve are great, especially when 
each day’s work is recorded, the progress measured, re- 
wards offered and competition provided as incentives, the 
tendency to ease up is quite usual. Sometimes this shows 
itself in a level or “plateau” in the curve, although some 
levels, even declines, are otherwise occasioned. Figure 41 
illustrates plateaus out of which the curve of learning 
emerges to reach higher levels. Often under ordinary 
conditions of life or school, where actual improvement is 
less emphasized, cherished and rewarded, the plateau be- 
comes a permanent level. 
Plateaus in the Learning Curve.—Plateaus may, how- 
ever, occur despite an interest in improvement and an 
effort to secure it. Sometimes they are due to uninten- 
tionally but unhappily hitting upon a bad habit or 
method which interferes with further progress until it is 
eliminated. In writing, a pupil may develop an unfavor- 
able sitting position or too firm a grip of the pencil; in 
reading, a habit of pausing too frequently in a line, or of 
giving too much attention to the minute details of words; 
habits which may inhibit progress until they are acci- 
dentally or by means of the teacher’s instructions cor- 
rected. Plateaus may be caused by eye trouble, fatigue
-P-A-G-E-344
  328 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
and other physiological conditions, despite intentions to 
improve. Sometimes levels in the curve, persisting for 
‘days or even months and often discouraging to the learner, 
are encountered when actual progress is being made. In 
reading, the introduction of visual analysis of words may 
temporarily disturb the pupil’s facility. When his per- 
formance is measured by the 
no speed and accuracy of read-

from one stage to another is seldom abrupt; a good deal 
of overlapping is the rule, and while the one is shading 
into the other, errors and periods of confusion are fre- 
quent. The danger is that these will so annoy the learner 
that he will drop back to the lower but more familiar 
level.

universal. (See Figures 35-38.) These fluctuations are 
due to temporary habits, good or bad, differing bodily 
conditions, interests, distractions, incentives, or other 
temporary influences. Individuals will have not only 
good and bad days, but good and bad hours, or minutes, 
during the same day, often for reasons that are difficult 
to discover. 
Tue INFLUENCE oF DisusE. 
Disuse is, of course, a passive state in which the mech- 
anisms, trained during practice, are left inactive. The 
effects of practice gradually die out at a rate which de- 
pends upon the native retentiveness of the particular 
neurones for the particular individual concerned. No 
satisfactory information has as yet been secured concern- 
ing the precise rate at which particular connections 
strengthened by exercise weaken through disuse, or to 
what limits the effects of disuse may go. The whole 
matter of the change in a particular bond occasioned by 
disuse must be treated hypothetically by deduction from 
the rather crude experiments upon complexes of connec- 
tions, constituting functions such as memorizing words, 
learning telegraphy, and the like. 
In the previous chapter, we described a case of a child 
who learned to react to the spoken word “leaf” by think- 
ing of the object when the word and object were presented 
together repeatedly. To begin with, the connection be- 
tween the word “leaf” and the conscious reaction or idea 
of leaf was very weak. In Figure 39 this is represented as 
above zero but below the “limen” of recall; that is, the 
connection is not strong enough actually to produce the 
response. One simultaneous reaction to the word and the 
   
-P-A-G-E-346
    330 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
object strengthens the connections somewhat, but not 
sufficiently to provide the response. Further repetitions 
gradually increase the strength of the connections until, 
perhaps, after thousands of repetitions, it reaches a limit 
—the physiological limit—which represents the strongest 
and most permanent connection possible. There are, 
then, various degrees of strength in a connection, from 
zero up to the threshold (or limen) of reaction and from 
that point on to a theoretical limit. One may study an 
item to a point where he can barely recall it, or over- 
learn it to various degrees. The more thoroughly it is 
overlearned, the more promptly, surely, and easily it can 
be recalled. If the reactions are now given no exercise, 
disuse gradually results in a weakening of the strength of 
the connections, which would result in a lessening of the 
promptness, certainty, and ease of recall and, finally, in 
inability to recall. But even when the connection be- 
comes so weak as to lie below the limen, there are still 
differences in degrees of strength, or in other words, differ- 
ences in degrees of weakness between the limen and the 
zero point. 
Overlearning and Disuse——From the experimental 
studies, which are unfortunately very few, it appears that 
the rate at which connections lose strength through disuse 
depends mainly on how strong they were at the beginning 
of the period—that is, on how much they were over- 
learned. Reactions greatly overlearned, such as our 
names, the A B C’s, and many familiar words, or motor 
acts as holding a pencil, or humming “Home, Sweet 
Home,” will probably function after thirty, forty, or 
more years of disuse, although they will have lost more 
or less of the original promptness and ease of action. 
Names of old friends, the appearance of the scene of a 
summer’s vacation, a poem or song greatly overlearned,
-P-A-G-E-347

the act of catching a baseball, and other acts representing 
connections less thoroughly established will remain above 
the threshold of reaction for many years, and thus, by 
various degrees, we may come down to responses that 
were originally exercised sufficiently to place them barely 
above the threshold of reaction.

Fig. 39.—Prosasie Inrivencn or Disuse IN THE Case or Functions 
OveRLEARNED IN Vartous Decrees. Curve A shows the loss or for- 
getting which occurs when the function is barely learned. The 
initial loss is rapid and great, followed by a much slower rate of 
deterioration. B, C and D show probable losses in functions which 
are overlearned slightly, considerably and greatly, respectively. In 
all cases, after the rapid initial loss, the strength of the connec- 
tions steadily but slowly decreases. 
Curves of Forgetting.—It is upon functions barely 
learned that most of the experimental studies of the 
effects of disuse are based. A pioneer investigator in the 
‘field (Ebbinghaus) examined the permanence of his own 
learning of non-sense syllables after they had been barely 
learned—that is, learned until he had made just one 
correct recitation. Practice was given up, and after a 
period of disuse he relearned the same series. The loss in 
the strength of connections—or, as it is more accurately 
expressed in this case, “the amount of forgetting’—is 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
  332 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
measured by the relative amount or percentage of time 
taken to relearn the material to the point of one recall. 
The loss of ability, as thus measured, is very rapid at first 
and then tapers off gradually. In another study (by 
Strong) were obtained about the same results when dif- 
ferent materials and a different method of measuring 
forgetting was used. Another investigator (Radosavl- 
jevich) found that when non-sense syllables were 
learned more thoroughly, namely, until they could be re- 
called twice in succession, the effects of disuse were not 
so great. The first investigator found that after twenty- 
four hours of disuse, two-thirds of the original time was 
required to relearn, whereas the last investigator found 
that when material was overlearned slightly (two correct 
recitations instead of one) only one-third of the original 
learning time was required to relearn after twenty-four 
hours. 
Figure 39 illustrates roughly the probable curves of 
disuse which may follow various stages of overlearning. 
These relations, however, are merely estimates based upon 
the few facts now available. They are intended to pre- 
sent roughly the general facts that the rate of loss through 
disuse depends upon the degree of learning and that loss 
goes on both above and below the threshold of response. 
Loss of Motor Ability from Disuse——Information is 
seldom overlearned to the extent that skill is. Writing, 
reading, speaking, typewriting, and swimming are com- 
plexes of large numbers of connections, some of which 
must be tremendously overlearned before even moderate 
proficiency in the function as a whole is possible. Many 
of the constituent connections, moreover, are really not 
idle during disuse, but are being exercised in other skills 
and thus kept strong. With complete disuse, the con- 
nections involved in motor functions do die out and, when 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
HUMAN AND ANIMAL LEARNING 333 
originally overlearned to the same degree as the bonds 
involved in acquiring information, the rate of deteriora- 
tion is probably about the same, although it is not im- 
possible that the latter are somewhat less stable. 
Degree of Retention Conditioned by Methods of 
Learning.—The effects of practice, then, die out gradually 
at a rate which depends on the amount of overlearning, 
and on the native retentiveness of the particular neurones 
in the particular person concerned. There is no way in 
which one’s native retentiveness may be increased so far 
as is now known. Whatever the degree of native reten- 
tiveness anyone may possess, the permanence of reten- 
tion is determined by the way he learns, not wholly by 
the time spent in practice, but in a large measure by the 
way in which the time is spent. Learning, as was illus- 
trated earlier in this chapter, is more than mere repeti- 
tion. Economical learning and as a consequence optimum 
retention—since retention is a passive matter depending 
partly on the process of learning—depends on utilizing 
effective incentives, on eliminating the wrong and select- 
ing the right reactions with dispatch, on overlearning to 
the right degree, neither too much or too little, for the 
purpose in hand, and on a number of economical devices 
to which succeeding chapters will be devoted. 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. Collect some instances of animal learning in which ideas: or 
understanding seem to have been present. See if you can 
explain the learning in other ways. If no other explanation is 
apparent should you, as a scientific thinker, conclude that ideas 
or understanding was present? Review the relevant. sections of 
Chapter 1 on this point. ¥ 
2. Thirty years ago most of our notions of how animals learn were 
based on what is called the “anecdote method.” What, prob- 
ably, was this method and why is it not now trusted?

1d? . Make a list of functions acquired by man but never learned by 
animals. Which of these may be explained as probably due to 
the limitations of the animals’ (a) sense organs, (b) muscular 
mechanisms and (c) intelligence. Enumerate some very skillful 
acts that animals learn during wild life or as the result of tuition 
as among circus animals. Explain them as due to specially well 
adapted sense organs or muscular mechanisms. 
Summarize the main similarities and differences between animal 
and human learning. 
An experiment upon improvement in reading. For practice, 
attempt to speed up in all of your daily reading for 30 days. 
Try to bring about an increase in speed by pushing yourself 
beyond your ordinary rate. Give yourself a test, at about the 
same time each day, by getting some one to time you while you 
read for 10 minutes as rapidly as you can comprehend. For 
test material use a book of moderate and uniform difficulty. 
Record the number of lines read on each 10-minute test. Plot 
a “curve of learning.” 
Compare your progress with that of others. At the end of 30 
days, see if you think you have reached your limit. How can 
you be sure whether you are on a plateau or at your physio- 
logical limit? Test your judgment by continuing the experi- 
ment. Was the general curve uniform or irregular? Can you 
account for the small variations from day to day? 
Just what is meant by the physiological limit? In what func- 
tions have you reached your physiological limit? See if you 
can increase your speed of tapping or of saying the ABC’s. 
Name functions in which a slight improvement can be attained 
only at a great cost of time and effort. Name some in which 
the experiment is worth the cost; some in which it is not. 
How may we determine the optimum development of school 
functions—reading, spelling, writing, typewriting, speed and 
accuracy of multiplication? Cite opinions or experimental evi- 
dence concerning the degree of efficiency demanded by various 
vocations. 
Can you give any illustrations from your own experience in 
which improvement has been blocked by the formation of 
inappropriate habits, loss of interest, staleness, or fatigue? 
What is meant by “overlearning”’? What is overlearned when 
one can typewrite 60 words a minute?

12. Cite a dozen functions which the high school graduate has over- 
learned. In what cases has there been too much, in what too 
little, overlearning? 
13. Suggest an effective way of relearning poetry or names in order 
to give special practice to those bonds which generally need 
relearning. 
14, What does a’pupil in school know about his curve of learning 
in various functions? What should he know? How might such 
curves be secured? 
15. Criticise this statement: “We learn to swim in winter, and 
learn to skate in summer.” Account for any appearance of 
improvement as a result of a period of no exercise. 
16. Why is it that certain experiences of childhood are apparently 
very well remembered? 
17. In what functions does it appear that loss is very great from 
disuse? In what ones does it appear to be less great? 
18. James states that “Nothing we ever do is in strict scientific 
literalness wiped out.” Just what is meant by this? Certainly, 
experiences are “forgotten,” that is, cannot be recalled con- 
sciously. What has become of them and how may they func- 
tion? What evidence can you cite to show that some trace of 
past experience may function years after it is forgotten in the 
sense that it cannot be consciously recalled? 
| 19. Is there a single typical curve of forgetting for all functions? 
20. If one plays tennis only 2 months per year, but plays baseball 
8 months and handball 7 months, would you expect the skill in 
tennis to deteriorate during the 10 months as much as if baseball 
and handball were not played at all? Explain. 
21. List and define all the new terms found in this chapter.

: CHAPTER XII 
BOONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING. 
" Animals are ee to profit materially by the observa- 
ion of the performance which they are striving to learn, 
cy the use of models or by guidance mediated through 
‘Jeas otherwise expressed. They learn almost exclusively 
iv unrestricted trial and accidental success. The human 
barner, on the other hand, may profit considerably by 
isight achieved by observation and by instruction con- 
oerming methods of procedure. Both human and animal 
®,arners may be helped, however, by means of properly 
janaged motivation, rewards and punishment, by the 
“ptimum arrangement of practice periods, their length 
;ad distribution, and by other types of mechanical super- 
.ision. To these methods of abridging the process of 
‘arning, which is laborious enough at best, the present 
“hapter will be devoted. 
The principles of economy will be grouped with refer- 
nce to two types, or really two phases of learning: 
1. The acquisition of motor reactions or skills. 
2. The acquisition of facts and information, usually 
termed memorizing. 
This division is made not because the principles differ 
in the two instances—they are essentially the same—but 
merely for convenience in discussion. Were the prin- 
ciples of economy fundamentally different for the several 
phases of learning, practice in most functions would 
afford most puzzling problems. For example, in learning 
a 337 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  338 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
to read one must take care of the formation of proper 
motor reactions, the highly complex habits of eye control 
and the management of articulation, audible or silent, 
and of the acquisition of ideas, that is, of comprehension 
or thought getting. If the rules for guidance were essen- 
tially different for these phases—and in almost every 
_ instance of human learning both are present—marked 
economy could scarcely be achieved. Fortunately, the 
main principles are everywhere the same; although, un- 
fortunately, in many instances they are not altogether 
clear. 
Princrpies or Economy In THE Acquisition or Motor 
SKILLS. 
Evidence That Guidance Is Desirable-—We need only 
to point to the “hunt-and-hit” methods of typewriting, 
the “pulls” and “slices” in golf, the cramped grips in 
writing, the “dog-fashion” strokes in swimming, to con- 
vince most people of the inadequacies of unguided learn- 
ing. By teaching and guiding the learner to acquire the 
“touch method” of typing, the proper golf swing, the 
positions and functions of the fingers in writing, or the 
“crawl” stroke in swimming, much higher proficiency is 
achieved. The learner left to himself usually adopts the 
first method he stumbles upon, a method that is rarely 
good. The effective methods often are more difficult in 
the early stages, immediate returns are often meagre, 
and, in general, the unguided learner seeks immediate 
progress; he follows the line of least resistance. Not only, 
then, is it the business of the teacher to know what to 
learn but also how to learn. 
Know the Character of Effective Performance.—The 
first requirement of an instructor, or of a person manag- 
ing his own learning, is knowledge of the character of 
 
-P-A-G-E-355
   
   
                                     
   
                   ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 339 
the good performance. To determine this is often diffi- 
cult and may be done only by extensive research. There 
are a number of brilliant examples of such achievements. 
An interesting one was the analysis of good and poor 
bricklaying. By the device of photographing the move- 
ments of small electric lights attached to the bodies and 
hands of various workers, an investigator (Gilbreth) was 
able to detect wasteful operations both among expert 
bricklayers and those learning the trade. He was able 
finally, by reducing the number of movements and sub- 
stituting quick and easy ones for slow and hard ones, to 
increase the achievement of an average laborer from 
120 to 350 bricks per hour. By the use of the same device, 
or of “slow” motion pictures, similar improvements in 
technique have been and still may be accomplished in in- 
dustrial skills. In school functions such as writing, 
drawing and eye movements in reading, similar studies 
have been made. In tennis, baseball, pole vaulting, type- 
writing, playing musical instruments, indeed in many 
types of motor skill, such analysis made by skillful hands 
will make possible substantial improvements in teaching 
and performing. 
The Observation of Performances and Models.— 
Having ascertained the detailed operations that will yield 
the beset results, how are they to be taught? The first 
problem is that of taking advantage of human capacity 
to profit by observation of a performance or a model. 
Choice here is determined entirely by the clearness with 
which the performance or the model illustrates what is 
to be done. Despite the great number of functions in 
which learning is more or less guided by our observations 
of others in action, most of the motor activities in com- 
mon skills are exceedingly difficult to perceive. Inasmuch 
as he does not always know just what to look for or where
-P-A-G-E-356
    340 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
or how to look, the learner often profits little by observ- 
ing an expert typist, tennis player, golfer or singer. 
Especially the child finds difficulty in seeing how the 
teacher writes, dances or ties a knot. To referee—that is, 
to observe skillfully—a boxing contest or wrestling 
match; to umpire a baseball game, or judge a diving or 
dancing contest is a fine art requiring years of experi- 
ence. Were finer movements not difficult to perceive, the 
sleight-of-hand performer would have failed long ago. 
Learning by observation is difficult. It is brought about 
in no mysterious, instinctive or intuitive way; it is effec- 
tive only in so far as the learner does perceive what the 
desirable reactions are and may then be able to guide his 
own trial-and-error learning accordingly. 
The skillful instructor should be a good actor, able to 
single out a particular movement and perform it alone 
and able to slow up a movement to afford more deliberate 
observation. The use of diagrams, mechanical dummies 
and slow-motion pictures often make possible the display 
of a movement more clearly than the observation of the 
original. There is no intrinsic advantage, because of our 
original nature, in any type of model. It does not matter 
in the least whether the model is a living movement, « 
picture of a movement, a lifeless copy, or what. The 
one criterion is the faithfulness and clearness with whice 
it displays the ends sought. Other things being equal, 
that model is best which makes the desired reactions most 
intelligible and provides the most effective means of dis- 
tinguishing errors and successes. 
Putting the Learner Through the Reaction.—In ad- 
dition to the use of observation of movements and models, 
another form of tuition that has from time to time at- 
tained popularity consists in putting the learner mechani- 
cally through the reaction or at least in providing some
-P-A-G-E-357
  ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 341 
mechanical guide which enables him easily to put himself 
through. In writing, for example, this may be done by 
guiding the child’s hand through the letter movements or 
by providing letters grooved in wood or metal through 
which the child pushes his pencil, or by allowing him to 
follow with his finger the sandpaper outlines of letters, 
or to trace on tissue paper the forms of letters visible 
through it. There are two ways in_which putting the 
learner through the reaction or mechanically guiding his 
progress might, conceivably, be of value: 
1. By providing a clear idea of what is to be done. 
2. By giving the mechanisms involved artificial exer- 
cise in the way they should function. 
At first thought, this device would appear to provide a 
simple way of eliminating the errors from what would 
otherwise be trial-and-error learning. 
What seemed, theoretically, to be the best of these 
devices, the tracing of letters on tissue paper placed over 
letter forms that were clearly visible through the paper, 
has been tested experimentally (Gates and Taylor). Two 
squads of children with about equal intelligence and 
motor ability but without previous experience in writing 
were selected. One squad practiced daily the tracing as de- 
seribed, the other practiced actual writing, using a model 
placed above the writing page. After about a month of 
daily practice on ten different letters, both groups were 
tested for several days in real writing, using only the 
model as guide. Some were almost completely baffled. 
They were familiar with the shapes of the letters, knew 
at what points to start and in what direction to proceed, 
but for them writing a letter on a blank page was a very 
different performance from tracing a form which showed 
itself through a thin paper. Some of them simply could 
not produce a legible letter; their consternation and
-P-A-G-E-358
  342 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
chagrin was pathetic. Adults may get a taste of the 
confusion and annoyance which these children experi- 
enced by attempting mirror-drawing, that is, attempting 
to draw, or even to trace the outline of a star when the 
hand and paper are seen only as reflected from a mirror 
placed upright beyond the paper. A person may know 
what product he wishes to produce, but most of his efforts 
lead astray. 
Direct practice in writing, in this experiment, was 
more effective than tracing. It would surely be also more 
effective than being put through a reaction more mechani- 
cally. Knowledge of what to do, where to start, etc., 
were obtained as well or better by direct writing. The 
muscular and kinesthetic sensations from the movements 
obtained by being put through are too vague and con- 
tused to be useful. The most significant factor, however, 
is this: the exercise of being put through or of tracing is 
not the exercise of actually writing. We are led again 
to an important generalization, one previously noted; 
one learns precisely the reactions that are exercised. In 
being put through a writing movement, the subject 
learns, not to write, but to be put through writing-like 
movements; by tracing in a.groove he learns to trace in 
a groove, by tracing letters seen through tissue paper he 
learns to do precisely that. The novice who practices 
swimming while supported by an inflated tube, after all 
usually fails to learn to swim by this means alone, while 
learning a number of things, such as balancing on a 
support, which are irrelevant. There is some transfer 
from such artificially controlled practice—the children as 
a group had learned some items that facilitated learning 
to write—but practice of this character is usually less 
productive than the direct type. Except in so far as put- 
ting a learner through a reaction serves effectively to
-P-A-G-E-359
  ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 343 
show him what the desired reaction is, such practice is 
of relatively little value. 
The Use of Formal Exercises.—A Seana used 
device in learning consists in the specific practice of 
some element of the whole function. For example, in 
swimming the learner may grasp the edge of the tank 
and practice singly some part or the whole of the leg 
movement; in singing he may repeatedly do certain lim- 
ited exercises; in athletics “formal” setting-up exercises 
are extensively used; in writing, many methods have 
elaborate systems of particular exercises such as repeated 
making up and down marks, ovals and reverse ovals, 
swings, loops, and so on. The theoretical basis of such 
formal exercises is the notion that to master the whole 
one must master the parts, that if one learns to do singly 
all of the elemental acts in a complex function, putting 
the single acts together will be relatively easy. 
This theory is quite erroneous. Learning to do the 
parts singly is by no means learning to do the whole. The 
greatest difficulties are often encountered in putting to- 
gether the elements. Moreover, the elements are often 
already sufficiently developed without the preliminary 
practice; if not, they are usually more economically per- 
fected in practicing the whole. Those which do not 
develop sufficiently while practicing the whole may well 
be handled singly later, but not until it becomes neces- 
sary. We should not begin with elaborate formal exercise 
of the elements or make them a large part of the course 
of training but utilize them as strictly preventive meas- 
ures where difficulty is beginning to appear or as remedial 
measures where a particular defect or deficiency is 
apparent. 
The Discovery of Errors.—As the term “trial and 
error” suggests, the appearance of inappropriate reactions  
-P-A-G-E-360
ee 
344 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
at all stages is characteristic of motor learning. Devices 
which help the identification and elimination of errors, 
unless they introduce other inappropriate reactions 
equally bad, are much to be desired. In the subtle ele- 
ments of writing, speech, tennis and other skills, the 
instructor has the double duty of being constantly on the 
alert for errors, usual and unusual, and of instructing the 
learner in the ways of detecting and eliminating his own 
inappropriate acts. Prevention is, of course, better than 
cure. Prevention may be secured to a considerable extent 
by giving very diligent attention to the initial stages of 
learning. In studies of children’s first lessons in reading, 
it was found (by Meek) that inappropriate methods of 
attack, hit upon in the first endeavor to learn, may be 
so persistent as to make later progress difficult and the 
work distasteful. Such difficulties may mark the begin- 
ning of “disabilities” in reading. The cases of “disability” 
—children who are persistently very backward and ex- 
perience extreme difficulty in learning—may be brought 
back to efficiency only by ingenious or extreme measures 
later. The procedure for treating such cases comprises 
the following essential steps:   1. Diagnosis of the particular defects or deficiency — 
responsible for the trouble. This is often an in- 
tricate task, demanding considerable insight into 
the particular skill as well as understanding of 
human nature. 
2. Making clear to the learner the sources of the 
trouble. | 
3. By encouragement or other devices arousing a 
strong desire to overcome the difficulties and to 
achieve normal ability. 
4, Providing remedial exercises designed specifically 
to supplant the inappropriate reactions by effec- 
tive ones.
-P-A-G-E-361
ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 345 
It is very important to detect and make annoying the 
appearance of the old undesirable reactions and to dis- 
close and make satisfying the new substitutes. Above 
almost everything else, knowledge that progress in the 
right direction is being made is a stimulant to further 
successes. In this work, as indeed all along, the instruc- 
tor or coach should constantly be on the alert for the 
recurrence of old or the appearance of new errors. They 
should be detected before they become fixed, and the 
proper response suggested. When an error is once elim- 
inated, it should not be mentioned again. Emphasis 
should, then, in general be placed on the correct reaction; 
but the incorrect response should never be ignored. 
The learner himself should be trained to detect his 
errors and successes. It is quite clear in observations 
even of adults in laboratory studies, that most students 
are unnecessarily poor learners, unnecessarily blind to 
.their errors and successes. Partly these deficiencies are 
due to the scant attention usually given to methods of 
learning. With a little attention to technique, most of 
us can become more systematic and more alert to our 
own reactions, and thus increase appreciably our ability 
to learn in each line. In learning to read, sing, and the 
like, the recording of the voice, which is later critically 
studied, usually aids greatly the process of learning. In 
other types of learning, photographic and other records 
may be fruitfully used. 
The Directing of Attentipn.—In connection with these 
suggestions concerning the value of directing attention to 
and discovering errors, an erroneous theory of the value 
of concentration on the sensations which arise from the 
activities of the muscles, tendons, and joints merits a 
word. This theory assumes that if one is attending to 
the sensations from the organs of response when a good 
   
-P-A-G-E-362
346 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
reaction happens to be made, he may later reinstate the 
response by calling to mind the complex of sensations. 
As one writer puts it: “A movement idea is the revival, 
through central excitation, of the sensations, visual, tac- 
tile, kinesthetic originally produced by the performance 
of the movement itself. And when such an idea is 
attended to, when, in popular language, we think hard 
enough of how the movement would ‘feel’ and look if it 
were performed, then, so close is the connection between 
sensory and motor processes, the movement is instituted 
afresh.” : 
Ask a golfer what ideas he tries to activate before mak- 
ing a stroke. He will not say that he tries to recall the 
hundreds of sensations from the body that he previously 
felt during the process of making a good stroke. He 
could not possibly do so if he tried. His ideas may be 
thoughts of cautions such as: “Now, don’t get excited,” 
or “Take your time,” or “Keep your eye on the ball.” 
As for the expert, the less he thinks about how he feels 
or how: it felt to make a good stroke, the better. He 
simply makes the preparatory reactions—adjusts his 
feet, bends his knee, places the club, and goes through 
with the stroke with no thoughts of the movements 
whatsoever. 
The whole notion that a learner profits by attending to 
the sensations from the members employed in a complex 
act is erroneous. Attention should be directed to: 
1. The features. which assist in securing the correct 
preliminary orientation. 
- 2. Features which help in detecting errors or successes 
in the act. 
3. The general outcome of the act. 
If one is trying to throw a baseball over the plate, he 
must first observe and thereby locate the plate. When  
-P-A-G-E-363
  ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 347 
the movement is under way it is wise to look at the 
plate, although at times—in practice—it pays to give 
attention to some part of the process which is trouble- 
some. Thus, the pitcher may be stepping out too far; an 
error which he must detect and remedy. He should know 
both when his moves are incorrectly and when they are 
properly performed. As soon as he gets the act going 
right it is better to think about it no longer. The other 
feature which deserves attention is the outcome of the 
total act: the pitcher should try to observe accurately 
just where the ball went, and try to account both for 
successes and errors. 
The same principles hold for other forms of motor 
activities. In writing, the learner must first get the cor- 
rect position, and second, keep on the lookout for good 
and bad movements by watching the product, trying at 
the same time to detect the causes of errors and successes. 
As he masters the act, the conscious reactions gradually 
drop out because they are unnecessary. Nowhere does 
the attempt to get an idea of how a movement feels 
contribute anything useful to the production of the 
movement. 
Summary.—The positive suggestions for economy in 
motor learning are the following: 
1. Make a real study of the characteristics of the 
function that is to be learned. For this purpose 
may be utilized 
(a) verbal descriptions where they exist; 
(b) direct observation of good performers or, 
usually better, 
(ce) pictures—especially slow motion pictures 
—graphs, or other mechanical aids. 
2. Make a real study of your own reactions as you 
learn. Develop ability to compare your own de- 
tailed acts or products with those of others and
-P-A-G-E-364
  348 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
thereby detect and remove errors, select and. 
practice successes. 
3. Do not depend upon formal exercises of parts of a 
function except where the part offers unusual 
difficulty; on artificial exercise obtained by being 
put through a reaction except as a devise for 
assisting observation of the form of the reaction; 
on the muscular and kinesthetic sensations. 
When in doubt as to the value of some unusual 
device, recall the principle: one learns exactly 
the reactions he practices. 
Economicat MrrHops or AcquirING INFORMATION OR 
MeEmorizine. 
Informational Learning as Reacting.—In the acqui- 
sition of information, great difficulty has come from the 
notion, often accepted in practice if not in thought, that 
a fact is a fact, and it will function without regard to 
the way in which it is acquired. It is often assumed that 
if multiplication tables, vocabularies, or names and dates 
in history are thoroughly learned, it matters little how 
they are learned. This is completely to disregard the 
fact that what we learn in these cases is not subject 
matter but, as elsewhere, particular reactions. We have 
added to our equipment certain responses which can func- 
tion only in certain ways—ways determined by the man- 
ner of learning. 
The first principle, already mentioned under motor 
learning but especially needing emphasis here, is this: we 
learn the reactions that we make. An _ investigator 
(Myers) once asked a large number of students whether 
the four on their watches was a IV or a IIII. Of 200 
students whose watches carried a IIII, 179 declared it 
was IV. In spite of the fact that they had looked at their
-P-A-G-E-365
ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 349 
watch faces hundreds of times, very few had made the 
specific kind of reaction to the IIII which would enable 
them to recall it as such. Similarly 192 reported that six 
o’clock was indicated by VI, when as a matter of fact 
there’ was no numeral at all at that hour. In another 
investigation, the experimenter told classes of college 
students that he wanted to test their ability to spell a 
list of words. When the six words had been written and 
the papers collected, the students were asked to write 
again the six words in the order given. Of 236 students, 
only five per cent recalled all of the words in the proper 
order; twenty-five per cent could recall the words but not 
the correct order, and five per cent could remember only 
half of the words and then were uncertain of the order. 
The explanation is that, having heard a word, to write its 
spelling is one kind of reaction, while to memorize a list 
of words in their order demands a very different kind of 
reaction. 
In another case, the facts are illustrated more clearly. 
A student in the course of some statistical work found it 
necessary to use the squares of numbers from 13 to 30. 
Using a table which gave these numbers and their squares, 
the reaction—think of the number, find it on the page, 
look at the square, write it down—was made several hun- 
dreds of times for each number in the range; but after- 
wards upon test it was found that only five squares (those 
of 13, 15, 20, 25, and 30) could be instantly recalled. If 
a different reaction—roughly, think of the number, then 
think of its square—had been exercised specifically, all 
the squares could have been memorized in a short time. 
In the first case, the ability to find numbers and their 
squares had doubtless improved greatly by use; but the 
reactions required for recall had not been specifically ex- 
ercised and consequently were not acquired.
-P-A-G-E-366
  350 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Consider the learning of a vocabulary which is given 
in the book as follows: 
1. Der Mann—the man, 
2. Der Knabe—the boy, 
3. Der Hund—the dog, 
4, Das Haus—the house. 
Suppose that the child learns the vocabulary by reading 
the pairs, one after another, in the order given. What 
connections are formed? Bonds between the pairs and 
their position in the series are made, and are especially 
strong in the case of the beginning and end of the list. 
Thus, Der Mann is connected with its firstness, Der 
Knabe with secondness, ete. Bonds between the first 
pair and the second pair, the second and third, ete.— 
that is, serial connections, like those acquired in learning 
a series of non-sense syllables—are also formed. Strong 
connections between the end term of one pair and the 
beginning of the next (“man’—Der Knabe, and “boy”— 
Der Hund) and between the various end terms (“man 
—boy—dog”—ete.) are also established. Learned in a 
list a great number of such connections are made, and it 
is upon these that the reaction may largely depend. Now, 
suppose you ask the boy to give the equivalent of 
“house”; or supposé Der Hund is written alone on the 
board. He may fail to make the correct responses in 
both eases although he could say the whole list as he 
learned it. It is something like asking an adult to give 
immediately the letter which precedes “q” or “o”; unless 
he has previously practiced just such reactions, he must 
get the answer in some round-about way. 
One must learn precisely the reaction that will be 
needed for practical purposes. Usually, we study the 
German-English vocabulary so that later, on seeing the
-P-A-G-E-367
  ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 351 
German word in isolation or in various contexts we can 
react with the thought of its English equivalent. A good 
method of learning, then, would be to take small cards 
and to write on one side the German word, on the other 
the English. Shuffle several such cards in order to avoid 
forming the serial, position, and other irrelevant bonds. 
Look at the German word and try to recall the English 
equivalent. This demands the reaction that one will later 
be called upon to make. 
Reading vs. Recitatior.—In one investigation two 
general methods of reacting were tested in the course of 
memorizing materials. One method consisted of reading 
and rereading a list of 16 non-sense syllables (or a group 
of five short biographies totalling about 170 words) with- 
out looking up from the paper. Another method con- 
sisted in beginning, early or late, to recite—that is, to 
attempt to recall when not looking at the material— 
prompting one’s self speedily by glancing at the paper 
when unable to proceed. The latter kind of reaction is 
just the kind that will be demanded later. The question 
is, does exercising as soon as possible the reaction that 
will eventually be demanded result in more economical 
learning and retention than the method of reading and 
rereading? The “recitation” method turned out to be 
quite superior, as is shown by the accompanying table. - 
A study of the table will disclose several facts: (1) The 
greater the amount of time devoted-to-recitation, the 
greater the percentage of the-lesson-_recalled. Of course, 
some time must be spent at the start in reading the ma- 
terial. After a few readings the process becomes partly 
recitation; that is, one skims over the items that are 
familiar, seeing a bit here and there and filling in the gaps 
by recall. This is true of the ordinary reading of most 
adults. This explains (2) the fact_that.one.does. better,  
-P-A-G-E-368
  352 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
relatively, in learning sense material by reading and re- 
reading than in learning non-sense words which, to begin 
with, contain fewer meaningful associations which make 
recall during ordinary reading possible. (3) The recita- 
tion method results in the learning of a different group

of bonds, the kind that makes for more permanent reten- 
tion, as indicated by the fact that the greatest superiority 
is shown in the columns of the table which give the per- 
centages remembered after four hours. 
As pointed out previously, a fact may be learned in 
several different ways. The best way is to learn it in 
exactly the form that will be used later. This is pre- 
cisely what the student does when he learns by recitation. 
He gradually forms and practices the reactions just as 
they must be exercised in recall at a later period. An- 
other advantage of the recitation method is the fact that 
during learning one discovers just what parts are espe- 
cially difficult or easy, and distributes his energy accord-
-P-A-G-E-369
  ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 353 
ingly. He finds what kinds of associative aids work and 
what kinds do not. Finally, the learner is aware of his 
progress during active attempts at recitation. In the 
rereading method, some were uncertain as to whether 
they were mastering the lesson or not; the learning be- 
coming very irksome on that account. During recitation 
the learner is stimulated and encouraged by the aware- 
ness of making progress; and clear evidence of success is 
a great motive in learning. 
The first guiding principle, then, is to consider the 
situation which life will present and so arrange the cir- 
cumstances of learning that the learner will be practiced 
in making those reactions which will be demanded. Do ~ 
not expect the proper response to appear as the result of 
incidental training. 
The Avenue of Presentation.—Similar to the problem 
of the use of the model in motor learning, is the question 
of the relative values of different sensory avenues of 
presentation, in the case of informational learning. Are 
we by original nature so constituted that we acquire 
most readily through the visual, auditory, tactile or some 
other sensory avenue? So far as we know, the primary 
and higher neural connections of the brain aroused 
through one sense organ are just as modifiable and re- 
tentive as are the centers stimulated by others. Other 
things being equal, we learn quite as readily through one 
sense as another with the exception, of course, of indi- 
viduals whose receiving, connecting, or central mechan- 
isms are defective. Other conditions, consequently, de- 
termine which avenue of presentation is to be preferred. 
Very young children learn new words better, for example, 
when they are presented to the ear than when presented 
to the eye, for the reason that their early word experience 
is auditory and not visual. If they have attended school, 
   
-P-A-G-E-370
    354 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
by the average age of eight or thereabouts children mem- 
orize better material presented visually. This is mainly 
because during study by reading the child can regulate 
the speed of reacting to the words to suit his capacity; 
he can attempt recall when and where he pleases; he can 
stop and repeat the especially difficult items, and dis- 
regard those already mastered. The differences depend 
on experience and methods rather than on intrinsic dif- 
ferences in the neural connections involved. 
The relative values of moving pictures, graphs, dia- 
grams, mechanical instruments, verbal explanations, and 
clay models are similarly determined by past experience 
and mechanical advantages. The main questions are: 
which method makes most clear the thing to be learned 
and which does it most interestingly and most economi- 
eally of time, space, and money. Original nature is not 
so organized that we learn pictures better than words, or 
graphs better than models. 
The Form of the Reaction.—It was stated that in ac- 
quiring information, one should practice the reaction in 
the way it is to be used in life, since what is learned is not 
an entity which we call a fact, but a particular reaction. 
In this connection, the question has been raised as to 
whether we may not be so organized by original nature 
that reactions made by some mechanisms may not be 
more readily acquired and more permanently retained 
than others. To illustrate: one may practice the spell- 
ing of a word mainly by articulating it, by writing, type- 
writing, tracing in the air with an arm movement, by 
moving the eyes or—eliminating these external expres- 
sions—by imagining its visual appearance, or by “hear- 
ing in the mind’s ear” the sound of the letters. Which is 
the best way? So far as the evidence now available goes, 
the neural connections concerned in one type of reaction
-P-A-G-E-371
  ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 355 
appear to be as modifiable as those concerned in others. 
We may, to be sure, form habits of learning our spelling in 
one way or another, of learning facts from a lesson, or 
acquiring names, dates, and telephone numbers by visual- 
izing, saying them to ourselves, saying them aloud, or 
writing them on paper and find that we are less efficient 
if not permitted to learn in that way. The reason in all 
probability is that such is our habit, associated with it 
are our particular techniques of learning. Any new 
method is likely to prove troublesome for a time. 
Consequently, we may still hold to the dictum: Learn the 
act in the way it is to function in actual life. For most . 
of us, learning to spell by means of actual writing, there- 
fore, would be preferred although oral spelling might be 
acquired quite as easily. If we are learning a poem to 
recite, it would be better to recite it while learning; if 
learning it merely to recall in thought, then reciting 
inaudibly is quite as good. 
Formal Exercises and the Use of “Crutches.”—Since 
we learn those reactions that are exercised we should be 
skeptical, in informational as in motor learning, of pre- 
liminary and formal exercises and of “crutches” or extra 
material introduced to facilitate one or more steps in the 
process. Many of the commercial memory training 
courses consist mainly of both of these types of devices. 
‘Under formal exercises they include everything from 
deep breathing and dumbbell exercises to the learning of 
series of names, dates, letters, facts, on the assumption 
that the “power of memory” is thereby trained as a 
whole. The fact is that the ability to memorize any 
kind of material must be improved through systematic 
practice on that kind of material. If our purpose is to 
improve our ability to memorize facts in chemistry, the 
early morning breathing and dumbbell exercises will prob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
356 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
ably be nearly as useful as exercises in learning combina- 
tions of digits. Neither will assist much. 
The term “crutch” originated in school circles and 
refers to the temporary use of a device to assist the pupil 
more rapidly to master some difficult task or topic. Add- 
ing or subtracting, at first, by counting on the fingers, 
writing the number to be “carried” in long addition, at 
first, to avoid forgetting it, writing the sign + or — or X 
to guide the child in computing are samples of crutches 
used in arithmetic. These practices are quite similar to 
the use of inflated tubes in learning to swim, or tracing~ 
grooves in teaching writing. While they may often pro- 
vide temporary aid, they often produce greater difficulties 
than they relieve. The objections to them is that they 
represent the formation of habits that later must be 
broken. It is sometimes more difficult to break the habits 
of adding by counting, once it is learned, than to have 
learned really to add in the first place. Certain crutches 
may, however, on occasions be useful and they may be 
employed safely to smooth a difficulty, provided they are 
supplanted by the proper procedures before they become 
habituated. In general, such devices are to be considered 
a last resort and then to be used with caution. 
The principle of “crutches” is essentially the same as 
the principle inherent in various memory “aids” or 
mnemonic systems of which a simple form is the familiar 
rhyme “Thirty Days has September,” ete. Like other 
crutches, mnemonic structures may occasionally be useful, 
especially where the facts, like the number of days in the 
several months, are difficult to learn because they are 
readily confused but, like other crutches, these devices 
are of limited utility. The most complex ones are rarely 
useful. The most competent learners, those professionally 
engaged in acquiring information, such as historians or  
-P-A-G-E-373
  ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 357 
mathematicians, rarely use such devices. They find that, 
in the main, they merely add so much more to be learned 
in addition to the facts. 
The Discovery of Errors.—Tests of school pupils and 
adults in language usage, spelling, arithmetic, for verse or 
prose previously learned, or for facts in any field usually 
disclose an abundance of errors. In tests of ordinary 
arithmetical operations practiced during a year, school 
children make on the average nearly two errors in every 
ten problems attempted. College students tested at the 
completion of a lecture in psychology for facts presented 
“during the hour (by Jones) made, on the average, from 
30 to 40 per cent incorrect statements. The recall of 
facts contained in a chapter read once carefully will be 
as erroneous. Such inadequacies of memory after a single 
repetition are to be expected, of course, but a difficulty 
lies in the fact that learners too frequently fail to realize 
which items are erroneous and proceed to practice them 
in further study or recall. Thus, like errors in speech and 
spelling, incorrect information becomes firmly established 
and difficult to dislodge. What one does thereafter is to 
practice errors. 
Just as in motor learning, devices should be utilized to 
forestall such errors and to eliminate them when they 
have matured. In some subjects such as language usage 
and spelling, elaborate studies have been made of the 
types and causes of frequent errors so that the teacher 
may be able to anticipate those which are most likely to 
appear and at once instigate preventative or remedial 
measures. Similar studies in other fields are desirable. 
Inhibitions in Recall.—Everyone has had the experi- 
ence of misspelling a word, miscalling a name or writing 
a wrong fact during an examination, when the item itself 
was really well known. These errors we call “slips” or
-P-A-G-E-374
ee 
358 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
“lapses” but there is always a definite explanation for 
them whether we may readily discover it or not. They 
occur in the motor field, too, as when we “muff” an easy 
ball, drop a cup or make a mis-step on the stairs. They 
are due to a preceding or simultaneous activity of a sort 
that predisposes or adjusts the neural.mechanism to react 
in a different way; some stimulus or attitude, usually 
subordinate, has become prepotent. Thus if I am writ- 
ing the sentence “This is the way to write the word,” 
and begin the “w” in “way” just as I think of “word,” 
I may write “word” instead of “way.” The thought of 
“word,” at the moment of writing “way” usually remains 
subordinate, but at times it gets the better of the other 
impulses, especially if it is a word more frequently 
written. In writing this sentence, a frequent error con- 
sists in the substituting of “write” for “word.” This 
error is due to the perseveration of the effects of the recent 
writing of “write.” 
These misleading tendencies appear more clearly on 
those occasions when a person is blocked in attempting 
to recall a familiar item, a name, telephone number or 
a poem. In such cases, to quote William James, “The 
state of our consciousness is peculiar. There is a gap 
therein; but no mere gap. It is a gap that is intensely 
active. A sort of wrath of the name is in it, beckoning 
us in a given direction, making us at moments tingle with 
the sense of our closeness, and then letting us sink back 
without the longed-for term. If wrong names are pro- 
posed to us, this singularly definite gap acts immediately 
so as to negate them. They do not fit into its mould. 
. . . The rhythm of a lost word may be there without ‘a 
sound to clothe it; or the evanescent sense of something 
which is the initial vowel or consonant may mock us 
fitfully, without growing more distinct. Every one must 
   
-P-A-G-E-375
ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 359 
know the tantalizing effect of the blank rhythm of some 
forgotten verse, restlessly dancing in one’s mind, striving 
to be filled out with words.” What may one do in cases 
like this to facilitate recall? 
The cause of such failure of recall is often the same 
as the cause of wrong recall, indeed, in most cases we 
do recall things that are recognized as erroneous. The 
cause is the prepotency of some inappropriate response 
and the relative weakness of the right one. In any case 
the difficulty is due to an interference of an inappro- 
priate with the usual associative connection; some pre- 
ceding or simultaneous tendency of thought or a sudden 
stimulus such as fear, excitement, stage-fright, loss of 
confidence may introduce interfering elements. The best 
method of procedure in such eases is first to search for 
clues while trying to regain confidence. Instead of allow- 
ing one’s self to become confused, eliminate the fear be- 
fore it gets started by “substitute activity’”—by plunging 
into an active search for clues. If it is a forgotten name, 
look the person over, recall his business, his friends, where 
you met him, ete. If it is a fact not forthcoming during 
an examination, confidently review related matter, recall 
when and where you have previously used it. This pro- 
cedure utilizes the advantages of facilitating stimuli; 
perhaps ever so slight an additional clue will cause the 
item suddenly to appear. If these maneuvers fail, the 
best policy is to dismiss the matter abruptly and turn 
to other things, go on with the remainder of examination. 
The interfering factors are usually temporary mental 
activities or tendencies which subside more or less 
promptly. If the fact cannot be recalled during a vigor- 
ous second trial following a rest, allow another period 
of inactivity. If the fact is not really forgotten—which 
it often is, of course—sooner or later the interferences
-P-A-G-E-376
eee 
360 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
will have been swept away, leaving the appropriate asso- 
ciations unmolested. 
In motor performance the difficulty analogous to er- 
roneous recall sometimes occurs in the form of loss of 
control. In typewriting or tennis, one may “go to pieces” 
in some degree, constantly making errors of one or more 
types. The explanation of these errors is the same as 
that for erroneous or blocked recall: some interference 
with the neural operations. The remedy is also the 
same: try hard, and above all, try confidently to regain 
control; don’t allow yourself to become discouraged or 
angry. If mastery cannot be regained in this way, it is 
better to drop the task for a time since to continue would 
be to practice errors. 
Summary.—Most of the suggestions for effective in- 
formational learning or memorizing are contained in the 
following summary: 
(1) Learning is an active process. We learn those 
reactions that we practice. Hence the attack should be 
vigorous and the reaction should be actually the one 
later to be desired. We should practice actual recall of 
facts to be mastered. 
(2) Since facts are learned through one sensory avenue 
as well as another, utilize the form of presentation which 
is mechanically most convenient. 
(3) Since the central neurones concerned with one 
form of imagery or motor mechanism are natively no more 
modifiable than another, practice—in spelling, memoriz- 
ing poetry, ete—that form of reaction which will be later 
_ demanded. 
(4) Use formal exercises, crutches and other mnemonic 
devises sparingly and never unless some special reason 
for them exists. Avoid learning irrelevant materials; 
avoid forming habits that must later be broken unless 
the temporary return is obvious and great. 
(5) Diligently test recall for errors. Try to detect  
-P-A-G-E-377
  ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 361 
mistakes before they are “stamped in”; avoid practicing 
erroneous reactions. 
(6) When recall is blocked, try to adopt an active and 
confident attitude. Search for associated clues. These 
devises failing, drop the subject for a time before trying 
again.

In this section such questions as the optimum length 
of a study period, the optimum interval between periods, 
the distribution of reviews, and related problems will be 
considered. With as many different subjects as there 
are, and with as many variations of the length of assign- 
ments, study periods, and intervals as are possible, it 
is apparent that an enormous number of investigations 
must be conducted before all of the facts are known. 
While the number of studies is large, crucial evidence is 
lacking in many instances; and in some subjects no 
investigations have been made. Guidance, however, had 
better rest upon the implication of such experimental 
results as are available than upon mere opinion. The 
statements in the following sections are offered subject 
to revision in the light of results of future research 
rather than as final principles. 
The Length of Practice Periods.—How long should a 
learner continuously study geography, spelling, or arith- 
metic or continuously practice writing, typewriting, or 
sewing? The results of a large number of investigations 
are not altogether in harmony, but they favor periods of 
thirty minutes or less as compared to longer periods. 
In one investigation of learning in “substitution”—a 
rather difficult function in which the letters of words are 
translated into other symbols by the use of a code—a

group of subjects practiced for sixteen days, using periods 
of the same length, and then were divided into four 
groups, one practicing 15 minutes a day, another 30, 
another 45, and another 60. The improvement in speed 
in the second practice period was then compared with 
the increase in the first period when all were practicing 
in periods of equal length. This is shown in the accom- 
panying table:

The thirty-minute practice period yields greater returns 
per unit of time than longer or shorter lessons. The 
sixty-minute period is especially unproductive. 
Other investigations of memorizing, archery, typewrit- 
ing, and arithmetic have shown in the main, that continu- 
ous practice longer than thirty minutes is relatively un- 
productive, as are very short periods of ten minutes or 
less. The facts vary somewhat with the functions, but, 
roughly, periods from twelve to thirty minutes are most 
desirable for adults. 
For children, the optimum practice period is shorter, 
depending on the age of the child as well as the function. 
In practice of difficult motor acts, such as writing, or 
memorizing as in spelling, a five to ten minute period 
without cessation is long enough for children of six or 
seven. The usual procedure is to allow young children
-P-A-G-E-379
  SESE EE AN LOTS TREE Te Ee 
ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 363 
a great deal of freedom to rest or change, with rarely 
more than twenty minutes given consecutively to the 
same general topic, 7.e., reading or drawing. The length of 
lessons is gradually increased as the pupils become older. 
The Distribution of Practice—If a learner has at his 
disposal seven hours a week for practice in typewriting, 
playing the piano, singing, etc., how may the time be 
most fruitfully distributed? Should he work continu- 
ously on one day for seven hours, or in half-hour periods 
—which, as we just found, are optimum—with intervals 
of a half hour, an hour, six hours or twenty-four? Ex- 
periments have not yielded entirely conclusive results, 
and but few functions have been tested at all. There has 
been a rather consistent indication, however, that by 
breaking up the available time into periods of thirty 
minutes, or somewhat less, with intervals varying from 
thirty minutes to twenty-four hours between, the best 
returns are secured. Thus it would probably be prefer- 
able to make use of the seven weekly hours by practicing 
twice a day for thirty-minute periods; or, if but three and 
a half hours were available, half-hour daily periods would 
be advisable. That is, one should make the practice 
periods no longer than thirty minutes and distribute 
them at fairly uniform intervals, of not more than 
twenty-four hours. If only two hours per week are avail- 
able, it would be desirable to divide the time into daily 
lessons of seventeen minutes each. When this scheme of 
distribution reduces the length of the lesson to twelve 
minutes or less, it would probably be better to increase 
the intervals to forty-eight hours rather than make the 
practice period too brief. 
The problem is slightly different when the task is to 
learn a speech, a short vocabulary, a particular musical 
selection, or a multiplication table. Should one learn

such short lessons at one sitting, or at several sittings with 
intervals between? But little experimental work has 
been directed specifically to this problem. In one study

on this point indicates also that distributed practice is 
economical. 
The Distribution of Reviews.—When maierial has 
been learned sufficiently to be recalled, how should fur- 
ther practice be distributed when it is desired to have 
the facts permanently learned, as is often the case with 
certain facts in history, poems, rules of grammar, com- 
binations in arithmetic, and the spelling of words?

ment, the operation is gotten well under way during the first two 
weeks and thereafter reviewed for. periods of decreasing lengths of 
time at increasing intervals. (From Thorndike, op. cit., p. 371.) 
Should the overlearning be carried out at once or should 
it be distributed over periods of weeks or months? 
The evidence bearing on this problem is insufficient to 
justify a confident statement, but it indicates that one 
should overlearn somewhat at the beginning and leave 
the remainder of the overlearning to reviews at con- 
stantly increasing intervals. For example, the first re- 
view, a relatively long one, should be made within 48 
hours; the next review, somewhat shorter, a week later; 
the next, shorter still, three weeks later; the next, two 
months later, followed by other reviews at intervals of 
five months or more. 
Actual counts of the frequency and distribution of 
articular facts in textbooks of history, arithmetic,
-P-A-G-E-382
  366 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
algebra, etc., show that usually little attention has been 
given to effective organization for learning in these re- 
spects. (See Figures 40 and 41.) Some of these books 
concentrate practice almost entirely at one point; some 
have feviews with too long gaps between; many show a 
haphazard arrangement, differing greatly for different 
facts presented in the same book. Careful organization 
with respect to the amount and form of distribution of 
practice adds considerably to the task of constructing 
texts but subtracts greatly from the learning task of 
students. 
The Whole Versus-the Part—Method.—If a person 
were given a lesson of substantial size to memorize, he 
might master it part by part or read it'as a whole. The 
fact that repetition of an item at intervals is a more 
effective method of learning than concentrated repeti- 
tion gives the whole method some advantage, since learn- 
ing a long piece of poetry, for example, results in longer 
intervals between repetitions of a given line than when 
the material is learned in smaller units. Several other 
advantages probably more important are inherent in the 
whole method. The attack is usually more active for 
one thing; the short unit seems to result in a more super- 
ficial manner of study; certain types of reaction—such as 
getting the meaning of the whole, observing the develop- 
ment of the thought, and the recurrence of similar ideas— 
are more adequately secured. The sectional method 
often enlists more artificial connections, such as those 
with position in each stanza. These may later be the 
source of confusion, since the first lines of several stanzas 
are recalled on the basis of being in first position. The 
part method introduces certain misleading connections. 
For example, when the first stanza is finished, the learner 
goes back to the beginning of the same verse with the
-P-A-G-E-383
  ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 367 
result that the end, instead of béing connected with the’ 
beginning of the next stanza, is connected with the be- 
ginning of the first. Hence children often get “stuck” 
at the beginning of a stanza which they can recite readily 
once they can secure a start. The main advantage of 
the whole method, then, lies in the fact that the connec- 
tions are formed in the way they will later need to 
function. This, with the advantages secured by the 
length of the lesson and the better distribution of repeti- 
tions, makes the whole method, in general, a more eco- 
nomical procedure for study. 
Many investigations, in terms of the amount of time 
required to léarn, have borne out the advantage of the 
whole method. A sample result is shown in the accom- 
panying table.

On the whole, the advantage of learning by going 
through the material from beginning to end each time 
is greater for the long than for the short lessons in this 
study. 
The whole method shows its superiority in recall some 
time after the original learning more conspicuously than 
 
-P-A-G-E-384

in the saving of time-in the process of fixation. The 
following table is illustrative:

The whole method shows to advantage in memorizing 
poetry, prose, vocabularies, lists of words, and non-sense 
syllables—and probably in most materials which are to 
be memorized in serial order. In learning by reading 
(history, etc.), the relative merits of whole and piece- 
meal methods have not as yet been demonstrated, but it is 
probable that reading a lesson through as a whole is 
distinctly advantageous. 
Either in memorizing or reading, the whole procedure 
should not be adhered to slavishly. Difficult and impor- 
tant sections should be given more attention; easy or 
unimportant matter “skimmed.” 
Complicated dance steps, musical selections to be 
played or sung, and many industrial operations fall 
within the serial type of learning which may be practiced 
asa whole or in parts. In an inventory of methods actu- 
ally used by one hundred prominent musicians, fourteen 
reported that they employed the whole method exclu- 
sively, another fourteen combined the whole and the 
piecemeal procedure, while the remaining seventy-two! 
learned mainly bit by bit. These data throw little light on 
the merits of the methods inasmuch as highly competent 
performers in every field often employ uneconomical 
methods. Crucial investigations in the case of such func-
-P-A-G-E-385
ECONOMICAL METHODS OF LEARNING 369 
tions are lacking. Theoretically, the whole method would 
seem to possess the same merits here as in the case of 
memorizing poetry or prose. One investigator (Peck- 
stein) found, however, than in learning certain motor 
acts, such as tracing the course of a complex pencil maze 
while blindfolded, the whole method was uneconomical. 
When the task was extremely difficult, subjects were 
sometimes unable to learn at all by the whole method. 
These findings illustrate the risk involved in widespread 
applications of facts found in one field to situations en- 
countered in others. This study, made upon a rather 
unusual function not much like motor tasks of ordinary 
life, offers little evidence against the superiority of the 
whole method. Nevertheless we must await the results 
of further investigations to determine the relative merits 
of the whole and the part methods i in te field of motor 
learning. : aN \ 2, 0

  CHAPTER XIII 
PERCEPTION 
Perception is a type of conscious reactivity and per- 
cepts a type of conscious response that may be discussed 
from several points of view. In the study of brain 
activity, in an earlier chapter, we found evidence that 
provided a distinction between a percept and a bare sen- 
sation. The percept is the awareness of an object, condi- 
tion or complex event whereas the sensation is the aware- 
ness of a quality, such as red, sweet, or pain. In the chain 
of conscious reactions, the sensation precedes the percept, 
and is dependent on different central neurones, although 
the neurones of the two are intimately connected and 
the time interval between sensation and perception con- 
sciously imperceptible. In the discussion of native traits, 
we observed that, while the capacity to acquire percepts 
is nativé, our particular percepts must be built up during 
experience. Percepts, then, are reactions acquired dur- 
ing the acts of perceiving or during perceptive reaction. 
There are typical errors and difficulties and rules for 
economy in perceptual learning as in other forms; in- 
deed, the main principles of economy are the same. 
There are, however, a number of facts about perceptive 
learning and about well established perceptive reactions 
that merit special treatment in this chapter. We shall 
begin with a description of the gradual development of a 
percept.

Tue GrowTH or Prrcepts. 
Facts, in the first place, result from sensory perception. 
They are the outcome of visual, auditory, tactual, and 
other sensory experiences with things and events. Typi- 
cally the percept, which as we have previously observed 
is a complex conscious reaction, is built up by reacting 
consciously to many stimuli acting at once. For exam- 
ple, a child on its second birthday is presented for the 
first time with a puppy. At first the little dog is per- 
ceived in a variety of ways. It is a small dark thing 
which runs about—sometimes dangerously near—with 
four legs; a thing which barks, whines, scratches the door, 
and sounds “pat, pat, pat, pat” when it runs; a thing 
which likes to eat and frolic. Gradually these various 
conscious reactions become connected with many differ- 
ent stimuli, so that to any one stimulus a joint response, 
the percept, may occur. Thus, when the child sees only 
a head or a tail, hears a bark, a whimper, or “pat, pat, 
pat” on the floor, or feels a moist nose or a shaggy back 
against his hand, he promptly becomes aware of the 
puppy. Trial and Error in the Acquisition of Percepts and 
Ideas.—The child’s percept of the puppy is a complex 
conscious reaction which is constantly undergoing change 
by additions and subtractions of the elements which con- 
stitute the whole. In this development of the percept 
the trial-and-error form of learning is apparent. The 
child at first perceives the animal and proceeds to deal 
with it much as he would with other objects with which 
he is familiar. He observes legs somewhat like those of 
his toy chair, and seizing a leg by which to carry the 
puppy about, the child’s idea is modified by the painful 
consequences. If the child squeezes the puppy too 
 
-P-A-G-E-391
     PERCEPTION 375 
affectionately, as he might a stuffed animal, the yelp or 
possibly a snap results in the elimination of part of the 
old way of perceiving the pup, and the addition of new 
factors. The dog, in the course of time, is perceived and 
thought of as an object with sharp teeth, a certain weight, 
great strength and agility, a thing that mustn’t be stepped 
on or immersed head first in water, which barks at birds, 
snaps when disturbed in feeding, and never talks, but is 
generally a playful companion. The child’s idea of a dog 
is a changing, growing complex of particulars. 
Analysis and Combination in Perception.—In the de- 
velopment of percepts two processes are going on simul- 
taneously. The complex object is, on the one hand, 
analyzed; the minute and subtle features are perceived. 
Little details of the dog’s appearance and behavior are 
noticed. The shape of the pup’s ears, the number of 
toes, the significance of slightly different whines and 
barks, the characteristics of its fears and angers are 
observed more and more specifically. Perception, and 
consequently thought, becomes progressively more de- 
tailed and refined. At the same time, a process of syn- 
thesis or building up is apparent. Perception becomes 
not only more refined, but also more broad and inclusive. 
The minute facts become combined into percepts and 
ideas more rich and comprehensive. Analysis and syn- 
thesis go on simultaneously and continuously so long as 
the child continues to disentangle new features of dog- 
ness, so long as he continues to observe new details. If, 
as a young adult, he undertakes the study of anatomy, 
physiology, or biology, his percepts and ideas of a dog 
will become greatly enriched. From the childhood per- 
cept of a queerly shaped hairy thing the dog’s body will 
be perceived as an amazing complexity of intricate organs 
and functions. The percept, then, is a constantly grow-  
-P-A-G-E-392
    376 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
ing complex of integrated particulars. It occurs as a 
single response but a great many facts are implicit in the 
reaction. 
PERCEPTION OF THE QUALITIES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF 
THINGS AND EvENTs. 
We have illustrated briefly the development of a per- 
cept of an object—a puppy. We found that the appre- 
hension of the object becomes at once more inclusive 
and more detailed. The percept of a thing always in- 
cludes the awareness of its qualities and characteristics. 
As the percept grows, more and more of the features are 
singled out, and at the same time integrated with others 
to form a single apprehension. There are two matters 
that should be investigated a little further. One is the 
process of singling out, of analyzing a subtle quality of 
characteristic, to a point where it may be perceived 
alone; the other is the nature of the stimuli which act 
when we perceive a complex fact. 
The Development of a Percept of an Abstract 
Quality.—The boy’s dog is perceived as an integration or 
unified collection of many qualities and characteristics 
such as height, weight, color, flesh, hair, strength, socia- 
bility, ete. All of these characteristics are implicit in 
ordinary perception of the dog. The dime which you see 
on the table may be analyzed into brightness, hardness, 
roundness, solidity, value. To perceive the dime is really 
to apprehend at once a certain combination of these 
qualities. Not only do we perceive all of these charac- 
teristics together as a dime but we learn to perceive each 
of these qualities—which is usually called an abstract 
quality or abstraction—by itself. That which is per- 
ceived may later be recalled, i.e. may become an object 
_ of thought. A tremendously important human charac-
-P-A-G-E-393
PERCEPTION 377 
teristic is the capacity to think of many of these quali- 
ties quite independent of the setting in which they are 
perceived. We can come to think of the quality of 
roundness, area, or honesty, without thinking of the con- 
crete situation in which the qualities have been observed. 
The character has been torn out, disentangled, abstracted 
during the process of perception from the other details 
among which it was perceived. This process of percep- 
tive analysis is usually slow; a trial-and-error procedure 
just as the perception of an object is. It depends chiefly 
upon the perception of the quality, say squareness, in a 
large number of different situations—tables, blocks, cards, 
etc. When the abstract quality has been encountered in 
only one or a few situations, it is likely to remain im- 
bedded in the larger unit. A mother—to illustrate—had 
attempted to teach her child the meaning of square by 
presenting the top of a box which was displayed while 
the word “square” was repeated and explained. Wheri 
the father was told of the lesson, he held up a paper, ask- 
ing “What is this?” “A paper,” was the response. “Yes, 
but what kind of a paper?” “A white paper,” etc. No 
effects of the lesson could be secured by the use of cards 
and other objects, but when directly asked “What is a 
square?” the child ran to the box, exclaiming proudly, 
“That is a square.” The element of squareness had not 
been abstracted. It had not been perceived as such but 
only rather vaguely asa ee of the box situation. To 
dev ess, one must show th 
many different gross totals which contain it, such_a: 
square card, a square desk, square Block acaquare board, 
drawing, picture, etc. When many different situations 
are presented, the squareness element cannot be easily or 
immediately associated with them all, and it is unlikely 
that it will become associated with any one since it is so    
                                                                 SE SA a ne oe ee Ee eee ee a ee ae 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
378 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
slightly connected with each. Eventually squareness 
comes to be thought of as an independent fact not tied up. 
with any particular situation and it is, therefore, called 
an abstract quality. 
This human ability to develop percepts of the qualities, 
characteristics, relations and other abstract features of 
things and events is of great importance. Such an analy- 
tic capacity enables us to get at the heart of matters; to 
perceive and think of facts more subtle than gross things 
and happenings. It enables us to apprehend more subtle 
signs of circumstances, signs which indicate a further line 
of action to be taken. Man’s relatively successful man- 
agement of affairs may be attributed in large measure 
to his ability to apprehend such abstract facts as gravity, 
weight, danger, triangle, honesty, liberty. None of these 
qualities is a particular or concrete thing; each is a char- 
acteristic of many different things. The life of thought is 
filled with notions of these sorts. Test this statement by 
observing, in the last few lines of this paragraph, the 
relatively large number of words which stand for abstract 
qualities, relations and other characteristics compared to 
the number that represent concrete things. 
Summary.—The process of perception is both analytic 
and integrative. Our percepts of objects and events be- 
come more rich and inclusive as they become more de- 
tailed and refined. We acquire gradually percepts of 
broader and more inclusive things and at the same time 
percepts of the component characteristics—weight, size, 
distance, beauty, value—of things. Often the quality is 
perceived as intrinsic in the thing as when we see a big 
or distant or pretty object. Yet these qualities through 
extensive experience come to be appreciated as such; we 
achieve a notion of bigness or distance or beauty as an 
abstract fact.

oF PERCEPTION. 
The Ease of Practiced Perception.—The acts of per- 
ceiving concrete objects and events, dishonesty or beauty, 
in a person, size, weight, position or distance of an object 
become so thoroughly practiced in the course of life that 
they seem to involve no activity on our part.at all. We 
can scarcely realize that such percepts mean a complex 
reaction by us. They seem, almost, to be impressed upon 
us from without. We shall be able to understand the 
active nature and complexity of practiced perception if 
we give a little more attention, first, to the variety of 
stimuli or signs to which we react and, second, to many 
ways in which our perceptive responses may be incorrect 
and incomplete. 
In most everyday types of perception leading to most 
obvious types of facts, it is usual to find that the response 
is really complex and ‘aroused by a large number of very 
subtle stimuli or signs. Of most of these signs we re- 
mained ignorant until they were disclosed by elaborate 
investigations. In the case of some of the most matter- 
of-fact percepts, the stimuli still remain unknown. These 
facts are very well illustrated in the perception of the 
distance and position of objects, a form of perceptive 
ability acquired very early in life and therefore, presum- 
ably, one of the easiest and simplest types of perceptive 
reactions. 
Visual Perception of the Position of Objects——The 
child soon learns to perceive at least approximately the 
ee es nee He perceives now that his 
dog is at his feet, now that he is at a distance behind a 
chair, again that he is more distant down the street. 
The child, or the adult for that matter, rarely gives a

thought to the clues by means of which he comes to per~ 
ceive the position and distance of objects in space. 
Nothing, it would seem, could be more simple; one 
merely perceives that the tree is near and the mountain 
distant. Yet such perceptions are tremendously com- 
plex processes and the identification and disentangling of 
the elements involved has been a striking achievement in 
science. The analysis of the process is interesting and 
valuable not only in its own right but also because of its 
implications for other types of human perception. 
When the eye is exposed to the light waves reflected 
from the landscape, an image is formed on the retina 
much as it is formed on the plate of a photographic 
camera. It is a flat image, without depth, the third 
dimension of space. The individual, of course, really — 
sees with his brain, although the activity of the eye is an 
essential step in the process, and he sees things at dif- 
ferent distances, not as if painted on a flat canvas. He 
sees things at different distances as the result of a num- 
ber of very subtle stimuli, all acting together in a char- 
acteristic way. One factor is the size of the image which | 
the object casts.on the retina; the nearer the object the 
larger the image. Another stimulus is the clearness of 
outline and detail of an object; the nearer the object 
the more distinct and detailed. A third is the color of an 
object; the colors of nearer objects are not only more 
vivid but they are different in quality, the reds and 
yellows fade with distance leaving distant objects more 
» predominantly bluish or purplish. A fourth factor is the 
appearance of shadows; those of nearer objects are not 
only more distinct but of a different shape than the more 
distant. A fifth is the cutting off of parts of the distant 
objects by the near objects in the same line of vision. A 
sixth stimulus is produced by the muscular activities of 
 
-P-A-G-E-397
: ee 
PERCEPTION 381 
regulating the lens of the eyes to focus the object, the 
“movements of accommodation” as they are called. When 
the object is near, the muscles contract in such a way 
that the lens becomes more thick or bulging; when the 
object is distant, the muscles relax with the result that 
the lens becomes more thin and flat. Accommodation for 
objects at any distance more than 50 feet is the same. 
A seventh stimulus results from the movements of con- 
vergence of the two eyes on a single object. When the 
object is very near, the external eye muscles pull the eye- 
balls so that the corneas of both eyes are turned toward 
the nose; as the object becomes more distant the eyes are 
moved back until, at a distance of three or four hun- 
dred feet, the lines of regard from each eye to the object 
are parallel. An eighth stimulus results from the rela- 
tions of the two images of an object, one in each eye. 
If you close one eye, you still see the object, so, of 
course there is an image in each eye. Now, these images 
are not precisely the same, and the differences become 
a clue to the distance of an object. To illustrate, hold 
your finger upright about five inches in front of the 
nose, and look at it first with one and then the other 
eye closed. The differences are considerable, becoming 
less as the object becomes more distant. A ninth stimu- 
lus is produced by the really discrete, but apparently 
disregarded double images of things nearer and more 
distant than the object fixated. If you have three ob- 
jects—a near one A, a middle one B and a more distant 
one C, and focus your eyes (also your attention) on B, 
it will be seen as one object, but A and C are seen sepa- 
rately by each eye. More than that, the near object, A, 
is seen on the left of B by the right eye and on the right 
by the left eye, whereas C appears on the same side of 
B as the eye which sees it. You can try this out by
-P-A-G-E-398
  382 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
holding up a finger of one hand about five inches and a 
finger on the other hand about ten inches in front of the 
nose. First fixate the near finger, and without releasing 
this focus, you can see a blurred double image of the 
distant finger. Now alternately close a single eye. 
Repeat by fixating the distant finger. Other clues by 
which the distances of objects are perceived are obtained 
when the head is moved. If you look into a clump of 
trees, and swing the head from side to side while fixating 
a tree within the group, you will observe that the nearer 
trees seem to move in the opposite direction from, while 
the distant trees move the same direction as, the move- 
ment of the head. 
The perception of the distance and position of objects 
reveals two important facts: 
(1) The fact that any apparently simple percept is the 
result of a large number of different stimuli acting to- 
gether. 
(2) That we may perceive very well without knowing 
how it is done, with little or no awareness of the clues 
utilized, of the stimuli at work. : 
Both of these statements are true of many other types 
of perception and judgment and of other acquired reac- 
tions as well. One may be able to perceive well such 
traits as beauty, symmetry, weight, honesty, or to perform 
well on a violin, bicycle, or typewriter without knowing 
how one acquired the ability or how one performs at any 
time. 
The Perception of the Location and Distance of 
Sound.—The stimuli which enable us to perceive the 
distance and position of objects were mentioned because 
they are better known than those for most other types of 
perception. The position and distance of a sound is more 
difficult to perceive and we are less certain how it is
-P-A-G-E-399
  
  PERCEPTION 383 
perceived. Variations in the intensity and quality 
(timbre) of the sound are doubtless clues for distance; 
and the relative force with which the stimuli affect the 
two ears are signs of direction. If you test a blindfolded 
subject with a snapper sounded in various positions in 
a plane equally distant from the two ears, before, above 
and behind the head, startling errors will appear. When 
the sound is moved to one side of the plane it is more 
readily located. 
Perception of Position on or in the Body.—The per- 
ception of location of a stimulus on or in the body is a 
puzzling-matter. How do you know that the stimulus— 
prick, pressure, cold, ete—affects your toe rather than 
your hand; how do you perceive that the pain is in your 
knee rather than in your stomach, when as a matter of 
fact, these sensations are due to activity in the cortex of 
the brain? So completely have we taken these percepts 
of position for granted that the questions seem almost 
absurd. Nevertheless, no one is able to answer them and 
science-aseribes-them either to. as yet unanalyzed “local 
signs” (i.e., sensory qualities arising from the sense organs 
stimulated) or to the sensory qualities of reflexes set. up 
by the stimulus. Both explanations are hypotheses and 
not demonstrated facts. 
Perception of Human Characters.—In the perception 
of human traits such as initiative, honesty, humor, and 
the like, the signs to which we react are usually as numer- 
ous and obscure as the stimuli which determine our appre- 
hensions of distance, or position or beauty of a house. 
Some of the known facts concerning social perception 
will be presented later in this chapter. 
“TIntuition.”—The term intuition is sometimes applied 
to types of percepts no-more-mysterious than the percep- 
tion of distance. “I know by intuition that this man is 
 
-P-A-G-E-400
er ery es me hen ee ne a 
384 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
not altogether trustworthy.” “TI dislike that man, but 
just why I do not know.” “TI feel as though I were 
catching cold.” ‘Something tells me that it is going to 
rain.” These are representative statements of common 
situations in which we perceive, but do not know by what 
particulars the percept is occasioned. Sometimes it is an 
obscure feature, such as a curious look about the eyes or 
mouth, which suggests dishonesty; sometimes many 
stimuli acting together such as various unlocalized sensa- 
tions from the body result in the impression of impending 
illness, or the unanalyzed effects of dampness, chilliness, 
and other atmospheric conditions, may occasion the idea 
of rain. 
These unintelligible ideas are of the same order as the 
ordinary perception of distance or time. They are no 
more unnatural and doubtless no more complex than 
many other types of perception. The fact that the causes 
of the idea are obscure and unanalyzed gives such reac- 
tions no claim to a special term such as intuition. They 
should be classed with many other types of perception 
that are as yet not reduced to their elements. 
Summary.—The classes of perceived facts are innu- 
merable. We perceived the sizes, shapes, locations and 
distances of objects; expressions of-anger, grief or deter- 
mination in face or body; we perceive cloudiness, damp- 
ness, hardness, stiffness, aboveness, number, pattern,. 
weight, closeness, justice, cruelty, metal-ness, sturdiness, 
harmony and so on for an endless list of facts of which 
we become aware by means of stimuli affecting one or 
more sense organs. That the particular percepts are ac- 
quired as a result of experience more or less extensive, 
that percepts change as our experiences continue, that the 
activating stimuli are often exceedingly complex and not 
consciously appreciated as such by the subject, have now  
-P-A-G-E-401

been in some measure illustrated. Next, some attention 
will be given to the accuracy of usual and unusual adult 
| perception. 
; 
Inaccuratr Prrcepts AND ILLUSIONS. 
Although we know very little about the stimuli which 
activate many of our percepts, we usually trust our 
observations; indeed, we probably are, on the whole, too 
insensitive to our errors. Inaccuracies and inadequacies 
pervade the whole field of perception although they vary 
greatly in amount and most of them have no serious con- 
sequences under ordinary conditions. Exigencies, how- 
ever, may arise, as in legal cases or medical diagnosis, or 
in science, when accurate percepts alone are admissible 
and inaccurate observations may be serious or fatal. 
Errors in perception may be due to several types of 
causes: 
(1) To irregular or unusuai@Ritions in the external 
world; 
(2) To defects, inadequacies or peculiarities in the 
human sense organs; : 
(3) To inappropriate operation of the human percep- 
tive mechanisms due to native limitations, to inadequacy 
of training, to the .character of established habits of 
expectation, or to misleading interests or attitudes. 
When the errors of perception are large or striking they 
are usually called illusions. 
Errors due to Unusual Conditions in the Natural 
World.—A stick thrust partly into water, appears bent 
although it is really perfectly straight. This error is due 
to the peculiar way in which light waves reflected from 
the stick are refracted in their course to the eye. Seeing 
the stick as bent is a false perception, or an illusion. 
It is not due to a peculiarity in the eye nor to an inade-

quacy in the perceptual habits of the observer, but to a 
peculiarity in nature. Seeing one’s face in a mirror, is 
in a sense an illusion due to causes outside the observer, 
but it is one of those errors of perception which we 
correct in the making. 
To some primitive peo- 
ples, such an illusion is 
at first dumbfounding. 
In some sections, moun- 
tains look much more 
distant some days than 
others, due to the influ- 
ence of atmospheric con- 
ditions. Such errors, or

will appear to move upward, due to a persisting influ- 
ence which disturbs correct vision. If you give Figure 42 
a circular movement of a radius of about an inch a most 
curious illusory percept results. If a similar spiral is 
spun around at a fair rate for ten seconds or so, the 
after-effect is even more startling. Visual after-sensa- 
tions and contract-effects are examples of this type of 
illusion. Vertical lines seem longer than horizontal lines; 
a filled interval seems longer than an unfilled in space as 
in the figure below. 
{piritin 1 [eke fas. Sosanf   
Two points about a half inch apart are readily perceived 
as two on the palm or lips, but when applied to the back 
they feel like a single point. These are samples of the 
many instances in which our percepts are really in error 
due to limitations of our sensory apparatus. 
Errors and Illusions Due to Central Perceptive 
Processes.—The innumerable errors and illusions due to 
the central perceptual mechanisms may themselves be 
subdivided. Some are due to taking into account only 
a part of the data required for a full and correct percep- 
tion. The car window illusion is of this type. If your 
car is motionless while another within sight starts in the 
opposite direction, you may erroneously decide that you 
are going forward. The movement of the field of view 
in the opposite direction is only a part of the adequate 
stimuli for this percept. On the other hand, if your 
car starts with unusual smoothness, you may wrongly 
perceive the other car to be in movement in the opposite 
direction. In this instance, the trouble appears to be in 
the obtuseness of the sensory apparatus for detecting
-P-A-G-E-404
388 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
movement. In both illusions, however, expectation plays 
a considerable réle. If some incident leads you to expect 
the stationary car to move first, you are much more likely 
to be subject to the illusion. 
Influence of Expectation.—Expectation is a potent in- 
fluence in many illusions and errors of perception. It 
leads us to mistake a shriek of wind for a human cry, a 
white garment for a ghost, a small tree for a man in the 
darkness. An erroneous report was once circulated to 
the effect that two children had been carried down the 
Hudson River on a cake of ice. Many people, crowding 
the shores at various points, mistook what was really two 
bushes on the ice for children because of the anticipation 
of such an appearance. 
The influence of the attitude of expectation in facilitat- 
ing percepts congruous with itself but incongruous with 
the actual facts is brought out vividly in laboratory 
studies of “suggestion” (such as those performed by 
Warner Brown). College students were led to believe 
that the purpose of these experiments was to measure 
the sensitivity of their senses. They were given a pre- 
liminary test in which they reported when they first felt 
the tingle from an increasing electric current passing 
through the fingers. Then, they were told to try it again. 
The setting “suggested” that the current would again be 
applied and they consequently adopted an attitude of 
expectancy. On the second test, the current was really 
cut off by opening a concealed switch, but nearly all of 
the subjects soon reported that they felt the current 
again. Similarly, they were led erroneously to report 
warmth in an unheated box with a big electric light on 
top; tastes of several sorts in distilled water; odors in 
odorless liquids; pressure on the hand when none was 
applied; differences in weights or in the length of lines 
 
-P-A-G-E-405
  PERCEPTION 389 
according to expectation when no differences existed and 
so on. 
Such erroneous percepts are quite familiar to the 
physician. After having read some vivid descriptions of 
the symptoms of diseases, many people begin to perceive 
these symptoms which were quite unnoticed before. 
Doctors receive patients who report pains and symptoms 
which are really illusions; indeed, the physician must be 
the alert, lest he make the mistake that has been made, 
of administering treatment or conducting an operation for 
troubles that are entirely illusory. These erroneous per- 
cepts are quite possible, since, if we give our attention to 
them, curious sensations may be experienced at almost 
any point and, as in the suggestion experiments, they 
may be greatly magnified or appear in quite illusory form 
thereafter. 
Establishing a mental predispositions by suggestive 
words or attitudes is a potent source of influencing per- 
ception in many fields. A smiling countenance makes us 
overlook evil designs; a “jolly up” makes the request to 
lend money or buy an automobile less unreasonable; the 
defects of a flattering man may appear almost as virtues 
while the every act of another with a shifting gaze appears 
suspicious. In interrogation, as in the court of law, 
skillful acting or the form of the question may set up 
attitudes that greatly influence observation or recollec- 
tion. One investigator found that, after presenting a 
scene on the screen, the errors in report were greater 
when any kind of question was asked than when the 
witness gave a free report. All questions are suggestive, 
some more than others. The following samples are ar- 
ranged in accordance with the results of an experiment 
(by Muscio) from the least to the most productive of 
error.

Questions of the more extreme types are what the court 
calls “leading questions.” 
Expectations Based on Habits.—The influence of ex- 
pectation is not always so simple in its operation as most 
of the previous illustrations indicate. This may be 
shown by the “size-weight” illusion for which materials 
may be prepared as follows: Secure a lump of lead about 
the size of a walnut, and then a piece of light-weight 
wood or cork to weigh exactly the same. Each should 
be painted the same color or covered with paper to con- 
ceal the materials. If you ask a child to “heft” each 
and tell which is the heavier, he will usually name the big 
piece, having been led by its size to expect it to be so. 
But if you try the test on an adult, he will unhesitatingly 
declare that the lump of lead is much heavier. Like the 
child, he expected the bigger object to be heavier, but 
unlike the child he made a big muscular effort to lift it 
and a smaller one to lift the smaller object. Because 
of the unexpected lightness, the big object is judged to 
be really less heavy than it is while the small weight 
which turned out to be unexpectedly heavy, is judged to 
be heavier than it is. 
Visual Illusions Due to Inadequate Isolation of Items. 
—Other illusions may be found which are not due at all 
   
-P-A-G-E-407
PERCEPTION 391 
to expectation, but apparently to an inability to isolate 
an item from its surroundings. Several visual illusions 
of this type appear in Figures 43 to 48. The Zoellner 
illusion, of which there are many varieties, illustrates the 
source of the difficulty and 
suggests the practical im- 
portance of these apparent 
oddities. The men’s legs

others, such as men of science, judges and juries, physi-

under conditions of expectation established by suggestion, 
is bread and butter to some, to many conjurers, quack

Some QUANTITATIVE StupIES oF ERRORS IN PERCEPTION. 
It is of value in many practical lines to detect the types 
of perception which are unreliable. To bring the limita- 
tions of perception to a stage of precise measurement 
makes possible results even more valuable; results which

often lead to practical applications not realized at first. 
Indeed, the quantitative studies of perception illustrate 
excellently the usefulness to which apparently academic 
research done in the recesses of the laboratory may be 
put eventually. The most interesting sample is the 
study, begun as early as 1825, of the magnitude of the 
differences between two stimuli of a given kind such as 
weights, lights, sounds, tastes, ete., which may be per- 
ceived with a given degree of accuracy. Essentially this 
is a study of the relation of the amount of error in per- 
ception to the size of the difference perceived.

Weber’s Law.—An early discovery in this field of in- 
vestigation, made by Weber and since known as Weber’s 
Law, is that the difference between any two stimuli which 
may be barely perceived—the “least perceptible differ- 
ence,” it is called—bears a constant relation to the magni- 
tu f the smaller stimulus. For example, an average 
person can just perceive the difference between a weight

of 100 and 110 grams; the difference is related to the 
standard as one to ten. In other words, the difference is 
one tenth of the smaller or “standard” weight. This 
relation holds for other weights. If the standard is 200 
grams, the difference, to be perceived must be one tenth 
greater, 7.e., 220 grams; if the standard is 300 grams, 30 
grams must be added to the 300 before the difference is 
perceptible, and soon. To perceive a difference in bright-

ness of light, the difference must be one one-hundredth; 
in the length of a line, one fiftieth; in loudness of a sound 
one third of the standard. Weber’s Law is merely the 
precise quantitative statement of facts well known in 
everyday life. We know that the slight blow of a chair- 
man’s gavel may be heard in a quiet meeting, whereas 
only a heavy pounding would be perceptible in a noisy 
gathering; that the addition of one light to 200 will not be 
perceived whereas the addition of one to ten will if one

do hold for a wide middle range.

bly Cattell) found that individuals differ in the keen- 
ness of their perceptions of differences and that the 
same individual varies from time to time. If a number 
of individuals were each carefully tested by a number 
of trials, and the results for all combined, the outcome is 
a series of differences, each perceived by varying num- 
bers of times; the bigger the difference the larger the 
number of times it is perceived; or conversely, the smaller
-P-A-G-E-412
396 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
the difference the larger the number of errors in com- 
parison. A sample result is given in the table below: 
Tue Numser or Correct Perceprions or Dirrerences IN WEIGHT

The standard for comparison is 100 grams 
Weight Compared to Standard............+ 104 108 112 116 
Per Cent of Correct Percepts of the Difference 68 77 88 94 
Note that the smallest difference is perceived by but 68 
per cent and that the percentages increase as the differ- 
ences become larger. Note also that the difference be- 
tween 100 grams and 104 is a difference perceived by 68 
per cent of the observers. Suppose now, we test the same 
group using as a standard 104 grams. We will find that 
a weight of about 108.2 grams may be perceived as 
heavier than 104 in 68 per cent of the trials and that if we 
go on, finding the weight which will be perceived as 
heavier than the one below it in just 68 per cent of the 
tests, we shall get approximately this series: 100, 104, 
108.2, 112.5, 117, 121.7, 126.6. When examined, this se- 
ries of weights—the differences between adjoining pairs 
of which are equally often perceived—obeys Weber’s Law. 
The relations between successive numbers in the series 
are the same, namely, each is about one twenty-fifth 
heavier than the preceding one. 
Practical Inventions Growing Out of Weber’s Work. 
—It remained for Thorndike to discover the practical use 
to which such facts could be put. He was trying to find 
some way in which one might measure differences in the 
quality of such products as samples of handwriting or 
drawing. He perceived that if you picked out from a 
number of samples of writing, a very poor one, then 
another which just 68 per cent of a group of competent
-P-A-G-E-413
  PERCEPTION 397 
judges declared was better, and then another which just 
68 per cent of the same group perceived as better than 
the second; and a fourth which 68 per cent perceived as 
better than the third, and so’on, you would come out with 
a series in which the differences between any adjoining 
pair were psychologically the same as the difference be- 
tween any other adjoining pair. The series would form 
a scale of increasing amounts from the poorest to the 
best, by equal steps. The steps would be equal in the 
sense that the differences between them are, to human 
observers, equally perceptible. This is, of course, the 
kind of equality desired for many purposes. 
In constructing such a series of test, it is not neces- 
sary to use the steps perceived by 68 per cent of the 
judges. If a series separated by bigger steps were desired, 
it could be secured by taking the items perceived as differ- 
ent by 75 or 85 or 95 per cent. The larger the per cent 
who perceive a difference, the bigger the difference must 
be. (See again the table above.) How widely sepa- 
rated the steps in the series should be is determined by 
practical considerations. 
Since the time of this discovery, Thorndike and others 
have produced quality scales for many types of human 
products—for handwriting, free-hand lettering, drawing 
of several types, English composition, poetry, mechani- 
cal designs, and different types of hand sewing. Samples 
from the original handwriting scale appear in Figure 49. 
Scales of these types are extensively used in schools. 
By matching a pupil’s handwriting with a sample on 
the scale, the teacher can give the pupil’s product a defi- 
nite score. She can tell how many units he is better 
or poorer than another; can tell just how much he gains 
during a semester in comparison with others or with his 
own progress the semester before; she can tell him at

much to make the work of education a more refined and 
effective procedure. 
Studies of Perception of Facial Expressions.—A quite 
different field of quantitative study is concerned with the 
accuracy of perceiving human expressions. The impor- 
tance of accurate perception of the symptoms of human 
attitudes, intentions and emotions in the face is so great 
that the child is early stimulated to acquire such ability 
as he may. Father appears from his day’s labor at the 
office with an expression which mother at once perceives 
and takes into account, modifying her words and deeds 
accordingly. The child fails to notice the scowl, but 
when his joyously noisy behavior is met with a sudden 
reproach, he is forced to a more careful survey of the 
situation. After many trials and errors, the child learns 
to perceive a variety of rather subtle features. The 
learning is slow, however; the average child is five or 
more before he can, for example, identify the character- 
istics which distinguish the ugly from the pretty faces, 
and probably considerably older before inconspicuous evi- 
dences of anger, pleasure, annoyance, or sadness are per- 
ceptible. The degree to which social perception extends 
among human adults appears clearly enough in instances 
which show an unusual lack of it. The individual who 
does not realize that he is boring when he means to be 
interesting, amusing when he thinks he is impressive, 
offensive when he tries to be complimentary, or who does 
not observe that he is unwelcome in a group when such is 
the case, portrays one of the most striking failures of per- 
ceptive learning. 
A beginning has been made in the study of the develop- 
ment of this social perceptive ability from childhood to 
adulthood by the use of standard photographic reproduc-
-P-A-G-E-416

tions of facial expressions of various sorts. A set utilized 
for this purpose is reproduced in Figure 50. 
_. The ability to perceive correctly the emotion or atti- 
tude portrayed in the photographs increases, gradually 
with age. The table below shows the average number 
of expressions correctly perceived by groups of children 
of the age indicated. The child of seven and a half is

of the possible ten. Some of the nine and a half year chil- 
dren were superior to some of the college women, since the 
scores of the latter group vary from six to ten. The set 
of pictures thus provides a rough measure of this type of 
perceptive ability; an ability of obvious importance in 
human intercourse. 
Perception of Traits of Character.—While individuals 
differ greatly, the average accuracy of perceiving some 
of the familiar attitudes and emotions by observing the 
facial expression is fairly high. When the real face with 
its movement and color, and the general bodily acts and 
postures are observed, the accuracy may be even higher 
although this has not yet been demonstrated. It is very 
important, however, that we appreciate the limitations of 
the study of perceiving attitudes and emotions. Percep- 
tion of these traits is a very different matter from the 
judgment of traits of character such as trustworthiness, 
sociability, humor, ambitiousness and such complexes as 
selling, mechanical and other abilities. 
The judgment of attitudes and emotions is but one 
phase of perception of the broader social and individual 
traits. Estimates of these broad traits of character are 
usually very inaccurate. A very fair sample of the results 
obtained in judging human traits in everyday life after 
short acquaintance is provided in a study (by Holling- 
worth) of the achievements of representative commercial 
employment experts. Twelve expert employment or 
sales managers interviewed 57 candidates to determine 
their personal fitness for a particular type of work. Each 
manager saw all of the men for two hours in the morn- 
ing while they were being put through certain tests. 
Then he saw them stand up before an audience when each 
applicant announced his name and certain other facts. 
Later each manager interviewed each candidate closeted

in a room where he could be looked over and questioned 
as desired. Sample results are shown in the table below: 
The Roman numerals indicate the sales-managers; the letters on 
the left indicate the applicants; the number in the table is the posi- 
tion which the sales-manager gave the candidate. The number 1 
indicates a candidate was judged to be the best, while 57 means the 
poorest of the lot.

  Candidate A is judged to be anywhere from the sixth 
from the best to the next to the poorest; B from the 
seventeenth to the fifty-fifth; C from the best to the 
fifty-third. The unreliability of perception of such voca- 
tional aptitude is striking. 
With longer acquaintance, the estimates should be bet- 
ter, of course, but the results of studies of ratings made 
by army officers of various personal and social traits of 
their men with whom they had been in intimate contact 
for a year or more were also very untrustworthy. To 
secure a degree of reliability practically useful, the esti- 
mates of at least three officers, each working out his 
appraisals in a most systematic manner, were essential. 
Commercial Systems of Perceiving Character.—De- 
spite the manifest complexity of the task of perceiving 
human character traits, there are a number of commer- 
cialized systems consisting mainly of simple lessons by 
means of which, supposedly, one is soon able to learn 
how to perceive various fundamental traits. Honesty, 
intelligence or executive ability—to give an example—
-P-A-G-E-421
  PERCEPTION 403 
may be perceived in the physical features of the face 
and body. These methods are utterly different in prin- 
ciple from ordinary precepts of attitudes and emotions 
based on the muscular patterns of expression. Such 
commercial systems assume an innate and universal cor- 
respondence between such features as the size or shape of 
the nose, mouth, chin or forehead, bumps on the skull or 
the texture of skin and hair, color of eyes, etc., and funda- 
mental traits of character. Careful studies (by Cleeton 
and Knight) have disclosed the utter worthlessness of 
most of these criteria. Most of the systems are useless 
and misleading. This does not mean, necessarily, that 
the advocates of the schemes or persons who try to use 
them are poorer judges than the average but it does mean 
that whatever success they achieve is due to the use of 
perceptive clues other than those they preach. Like 
other people, they do not usually know how they reach 
their decisions any more than they know how they per- 
ceive distance or time. Most of us take into account 
elements of speech and manners, the general physique, 
facial expressions (rather than features), dress with all 
the intricacies of style, neatness—all of these and many 
others. The commercial systems are not the results of 
scientific analysis, such as those made of the methods of 
perceiving distance; they are often pure rationalizations. 
Perceiving One’s Own Traits.—Not only are we rather 
poor, on the whole, in perceiving the traits of others, we 
are also often unreliable observers of ourselves. In part, 
failures in social adjustment are due to inability to per- 
ceive one’s self properly. It was found in an investigation 
(Hollingworth) in which each one of a group of college 
girls judged each of her acquaintances as well as herself 
for, various traits, that those generally recognized by 
others as the most snobbish, vulgar, or conceited were 
 
-P-A-G-E-422
  404 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
very poor judges of themselves in those respects. They 
apparently did not perceive, as others did, in their own 
words, deeds and expressions the elements of the unde- 
sirable traits. Similarly, those who possessed the least 
refinement, intelligence, sociability, humor and neatness 
were rather blind to their deficiencies. They possessed, 
moreover, inferior ability to perceive these characteristics 
in other people. Having never achieved clear ideas of 
what constitutes sociability, neatness, refinement, ete., 
either in themselves or others, the process of learning 
came to an early halt. They were like the child learning 
to write or speak without a distinct model to utilize in 
discovering successful and erroneous reactions. 
Greater accuracy in perceiving one’s own traits is to 
be acquired as other abilities are acquired; the errors and 
deficiencies are like those in writing and tennis and 
should be, in a similar way, detected and eliminated. 
Like detection of many other defects, unless we are well 
trained in so doing, an experienced critic may be required 
to help us out. Unfortunately, most of us are consider- 
ably more sensitive about errors and defects in character 
and social behavior than we are about defects and defi- 
ciencies in tennis or handwriting, and since we are less 
likely to be told about our errors we are less likely to 
discover and correct them. 
Economica Mrruops or AcquirING PERcEPTs. 
Many of our percepts are acquired during long pe- 
riods of desultory trial-and-error experience as described 
in the instance of the boy and his puppy. Ability to per- 
ceive depth, weight, attitudes and emotions in facial 
expressions, more complex traits of character in the be- 
havior of others or in ourselves rarely is developed sys- 
tematically and rarely is the subject of direct education.
-P-A-G-E-423
  PERCEPTION 405 
Other forms of perception, such as reading words, music, 
shorthand, chemical or mathematical symbols, judging 
perspective in drawing, understanding a foreign tongue, 
perceiving qualities of wine, tea, cloth, diamonds or pota- 
toes are sometimes acquired systematically and under 
tuition as in other forms of learning. The development of — 
ability to perceive the honest, and the moral aspects of 
situations; to perceive the beauty in music or art; to 
perceive the significant characteristics and qualities in all 
types of things and happenings may be desultory or sys- 
tematically guided. The principles of economy, as de- 
scribed in preceding chapters, apply to perceptive as to 
other forms of learning.

  CHAPTER XIV 
REASONING, IMAGINATION AND OTHER TYPES 
OF THINKING 
The term thinking is used broadly to include reasoning, 
creative imagination, recollection, night dreaming, day 
dreaming and other forms of reverie. We shall attempt 
to discover similarities and differences among these types 
of thinking after we have given some attention to the 
materials with which we think, to the character of the 
mental processes revealed by introspection during 
thinking. 
Conscious Processes Founp During THINKING. 
We are dealing with recalled facts and experiences in 
considering thinking. Recall furnishes the raw material 
or “stuff” with which we think. The first task is to 
observe the variety of facts that may be recalled and then 
note the kinds of conscious processes that are found dur- 
ing recall. 
What Facts May Be Recalled.—We can recall all sorts 
of things and events, and the qualities, characteristics and 
relations of things and events ovtside of the body. We 
can also recollect the happenings to and activities of and 
in our body. By things we mean objects, such as ani- 
mals and houses previously seen, flowers and spices 
smelled, foods tasted, coins handled, whistles heard. By 
events we refer to activities, movements, changes and 
happenings in or among objects. By qualities of things 
we mean the weight, size, color, beauty and the like. 
409
-P-A-G-E-428
  410 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Characteristics other than qualities include the speed or 
direction of movement, the unusualness or meanness of 
a person’s acts, the loudness and angriness of the voices 
of a crowd. Under relations would be included the fact 
that one object is bigger than another, that one man 
is the tallest of a group or that one dog runs behind 
another. By happenings to and activities of the body 
we mean falls and changes of position in space or frustra- 
tions and successes in movement, and the like. Under 
activities in the body would be included our emotional 
and organic experiences, our beliefs and doubts, our pur- 
poses and intentions, our interests and attitudes. The 
possible range of recall is as wide as the world of external 
things and events which we encounter and the inner life 
of the organism. Any fact onee within our experience 
may be in some way recalled. All of our experiences are 
not recallable, of course; many are forgotten as the result 
of disuse. But hosts of facts are subject to recall and 
these are the materials with which we think. 
Conscious Processes Found during Thought— 
Images.—As you recall facts of various sorts, what kinds 
of conscious processes are revealed? What are the char- 
acteristics of the “contents of the mind” during recall? 
This is a problem for introspection. Galton, who first + 
undertook to study this- problem by securing the testi- 
mony of various persons concerning the contents of their 
thoughts, found that observers reported several kinds of 
impression. Most persons could recall visual objects and 
events which appeared in the “mind’s eye.” As they 
recalled the breakfast table, they could “see” more or less 
clearly plates, faces and other objects; they could ‘also 
“hear in the mind’s ear” the sounds of voices and the 
clink of glasses; they could “smell” the odor of coffee; 
“taste” the orange; “feel” the pressure of the fork against 
 
-P-A-G-E-429
  REASONING AND IMAGINATION 411 
the skin or the movement of lifting the arm. They re- 
ported that these experiences were very much like the 
original impressions received through the senses. Though 
usually less sharp and clear, less definite and stable, 
these recalled processes were unmistakably similar to the 
sensory impressions. While these recalled impressions 
possess, in general, the qualities of sensations they are 
obviously not genuine sensations, since they are not 
aroused by stimuli acting on the sense organs. These 
sensation-like processes which appear during recall have, 
therefore, been termed images. 
Types of Images.—Most -observers report that when 
they recall facts during thinking, recollection, day dream- 
ing or reasoning, images are present. The majority can 
detect imagery corresponding to every type of sensory 
experience. Averaging the testimony of many observers, 
it is found that visual imagery is most frequently found, . 
-auditory_next, and kinesthetic next. Images of skin im- 
“pressions, organic sensations, odors and tastes are not so 
frequent. While a few persons report nearly all kinds of 
imagery to be nearly as vivid and clear as the sensory 
experiences themselves, and a few others find all of their 
imagery to be very dim and vague, the majority find them 
to be midway between these extremes—much less vivid, 
stable and definite than the real sensations, but clear 
enough to permit observation and description. 
The Imagery in Recalling Symbols.—Most people, 
especially educated people, find in the course of ordinary 
thinking that they recall not only concrete objects and 
events but words and symbols. Some find that recalled 
words accompany all or nearly all of their thinking. 
Some persons report fleeting images of the visual appear- 
ance of the words, some experience the sounds of the 
words, others find the kinesthetic experiences of speaking 
 
-P-A-G-E-430
  412 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
the words. A certain druggist reports that when he 
thinks of “prescription” he does not see an image of a 
bottle, or a mixture of liquids, nor does he hear the 
sounds of pouring liquids nor smell a complex odor, nor 
feel himself stirring chemicals, neither does he see a piece 
of paper with a written word on it, nor does he mentally 
see or hear or say the word. What he does recall is a 
visual image of the symbol B. The student of mathe- 
matics recalls other signs in common use, + or —. In- 
deed, most persons find during thinking many recalled 
symbols. It is usually reported, moreover, that words 
and symbols are recalled as visual objects, or as sounds 
or as motor impressions of saying or looking at the word 
or symbol. Since they come in the form of visual, audi- 
tory, kinesthetic or other sensory experiences, they are 
still images according to the definition. 
Individual Differences in Use of Imagery.—While 
most persons find during recall all or nearly all of the 
types of imagery, sometimes chiefly one kind, at other 
times several simultaneously, depending on the fact re- 
called, there are nevertheless some surprising individual 
differences. In recalling the very same fact, different in- 
dividuals may find very different kinds of imagery. This 
fact was suggested in the discussion of recalling words 
and symbols; some see the word, others hear it, still 
others feel it spoken. Some persons, moreover, declare 
that they can and do recall visual objects, diagrams, and 
paintings without visual imagery; others recall or com- 
pose music without auditory imagery. Musicians, for 
example, sometimes recall a series of kinesthetic impres- 
sions of playing or singing the notes, or the visual forms 
of the printed notes instead of the sounds. Apparently 
no one kind of imagery is absolutely necessary to recall 
any fact. It is found, furthermore, that there is no strik-
-P-A-G-E-431
  REASONING AND IMAGINATION 413 
ing correlation between vividness of imagery in general 
and intelligence or ability to think or to do creative 
imaginative work in any particular line. Intelligent peo- 
ple do not, on the whole, have more vivid imagery than 
dull. Indeed, experienced mathematicians, scientists and 
other mental workers, as a rule, seem to have weaker con- 
crete imagery than children. 
One of the most surprising facts revealed by studies of 
imagery is the great difference between certain extreme 
individuals. Occasionally a person declares that in re- 
calling facts of many sorts, he can scarcely ever detect 
any but visual imagery; another finds auditory, another 
kinesthetic imagery almost exclusively. The discovery 
of these extreme cases during the early days of the study 
of imagery led to the belief that all people could be 
sharply classified into “eye-minded,” “ear-minded,” 
“motor-minded” and other groups. Later investigations 
revealed the fact that individuals limited exclusively, or 
even mainly, to one type of imagery are very rare. 
Nearly all persons experience at least visual, auditory 
-and motor imagery, and most individuals find other vari- 
eties as well, although they use them in saiaehiis degrees 
and for different purposes. 
The varieties of imagery used by different people to 
recall the same facts and the apparent tendency of im- 
agery to decrease in vividness in the case of professional 
thinkers make it not unreasonable to suppose that im- 
agery is not indispensable to the recall of facts. 
Image-Less Recall of Facts.—There are some in- 
vestigators who believe that certain facts are recalled 
without any imagery whatever. When these observers 
recall that one thing is bigger than another, for example, 
they declare that the fact of relative size comes to them 
without any images of the objects compared or any other 
 
-P-A-G-E-432
414 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
sensory image. Especially in recalling relations such as 
under-ness or near-ness; abstract qualities and character- 
istics such as hardness, squareness, faithfulness, five-ness 
and other complex notions such as energy, heredity, lib- 
erty, the fact is said to be unaccompanied by sensation- 
like images. Some persons declare that they often recall 
ordinary things and events as mere facts without imagery 
of any sort. Some assert that at the instant the fact 
comes to mind, there are often no images present, al- 
though images of words which express the fact or of 
objects and events associated with the fact may follow. 
The fact comes, as it were, in the form of a unique 
process that one cannot describe. One can only say 
that he recalls a fact or gets a meaning. The conscious 
process found is not like an image, or sensation, or emo- 
tion or feeling or impulse. It is something different from 
any of these. It is a conscious reaction, the very essence 
of recalling a fact, but indescribable. Such reactions are 
now termed variously, image-less thoughts, or non- 
sensory ideational processes, or image-less ideational 
processes. 
Conflicting Views Concerning the Essential Processes 
in Recall of Facts——The search for the kind of con- 
scious processes which are responsible for the apprehen- 
sion of facts has not resulted as yet in satisfactory evi- 
dence. The traditional view is that groups of images 
were sufficient to account for the fact recalled. This 
view, as we have just observed, is questioned by many 
investigators who declare that they can recall facts when 
_no images whatsoever are present. Some of those who 
oppose the view that images are the essential data of 
thought substitute another kind of mental process, a 
complex response which results in the awareness of facts. 
A third view, opposed to both of the above, seeks to
-P-A-G-E-433
I 
REASONING AND IMAGINATION 415 
explain the apprehension of facts, the appearance of 
meanings, not in terms of any kind of conscious process, 
but in terms of the sequences of processes. In this view, 
facts and meanings are not found in any mental states 
apparent in an instantaneous cross section of conscious- 
ness. They grow out of the continuity of conscious 
reactions. A picture of thinking as going on in a mind 
entirely limited to images and other ideational proc- 
esses would be quite misleading at least. During our 
thinking and imagining we are conscious in some de- 
gree of bodily sensations, sounds, and perhaps other 
sensory impressions; we often then experience most 
vividly feelings of pleasantness or unpleasantness, im- 
pulses and emotions of various sorts as well as images 
and the alleged imageless ideational processes. Even 
during the most abstract reasoning, the play of processes 
in the fringe of consciousness may be lively and varied. 
We know that consciousness is complex during thinking 
but just what réle each process plays in the awareness 
of facts isnot known. We cannot at present say whether 
the recall of facts, then, depends upon some special kind, 
or on the arrangement or on the sequence of conscious 
processes. We are forced to take for granted the recall 
of facts without explaining their structure. 
Typrs or THINKING. 
The different types of thinking—reasoning, day dream- 
ing, recollecting, imagining, ete-—cannot be distinguished 
on the basis of the kinds of imagery or other thought 
processes found, nor on the basis of the kinds of facts 
utilized. The varieties of thinking are to be distin- 
guished in accordance with the way in which the recalled 
facts are employed. To the several ways of dealing with 
recalled facts (or ideas or thoughts) we shall now turn.
-P-A-G-E-434
  416 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Basis of Classification.—It is possible to distinguish 
two ways in which thinking may vary. It may vary: 
(1) In the degree to which it is a faithful reproduc- 
tion of past experiences; 
(2) In the degree-to which it is controlled by some 
conscious aim or purpose. 
In each of these respects, thinking may vary between 
two extremes, the greatest and the least exactness of 
reproduction, and the greatest and the least control. 
In each respect, then, we have a scale of amounts. To 
define any particular instance of thinking, it is necessary 
to find its position on each of these scales. When this 
has been done, nothing more is needed to indicate satis- 
factorily the character of that particular form of think- 
ing. This is the same as saying that the various forms 
of thought, such as recollection, imagination and dreams, 
are not really different in kind but merely in degree. In 
order to show more exactly the two aspects of thinking, 
examples which occupy the two extremes of each scale 
will be described. 
Extremely Faithful Reproduction.—Extremely faith- 
ful reproduction of past conscious experiences is usually 
called recollection or reproductive recall. When you 
recall a fact, an incident or a series of events as nearly 
correctly as possible, you may approximate the maximum 
point on this scale. It is rare that recall is absolutely 
perfect reproduction of a past conscious experience. 
Errors and omissions nearly always creep in. But within 
the limits of human reproductive ability, we may think 
of a maximum level. Much of our thinking is a rela- 
tively faithful sort. In recalling names, dates, tele- 
phone numbers, prices, facts of all kinds, and in remi- 
niscing, the facts sought are those previously known.
-P-A-G-E-435
  REASONING AND IMAGINATION 417 
This extreme may be contrasted with imaginative recall 
which forms the other end of the scale. 
Imaginative Recall.—In reproductive recall, the facts 
are recalled as faithfully as possible in their details, in the 
temporal order and in the spatial arrangement or pattern. 
Deviations from the actual are unintentional. In imag- 
inative recall the temporal order of events, the spatial 
arrangement, in general, the whole organization of items 
is different. In recollection, one recalls as faithfully as 
possible what did happen during his last picnic; in imag- 
ination, one may think, for example, of what could hap- 
pen at the next. One may recall the series of tones in a 
melody previously heard or the pattern of a dress pre- 
viously seen, and one may imagine a new melody made 
up of familiar single notes, or a new dress composed of 
elements of color, fabric and arrangement in new 
combinations. 
Imagination has its limits. We cannot imagine things 
or events that are completely novel. We cannot imagine 
a melody not made of notes. The new melody is merely 
a recombinating of notes which are themselves recalled, 
that is, sound elements previously experienced. We can- 
not imagine a new hat not made of color or materials 
which, in elementary form at least, have been observed 
before. A person deaf from birth cannot’imagine sounds; 
a person blind from birth cannot imagine colors and 
shades. The most extreme form of imagination does 
depend on the recall of sensory impressions. It is the 
temporal order, arrangement and emphasis given to these 
items which is novel. But by new organization, very 
different total effects may be produced and the rearrange- 
ment may be made in various degrees. Purely repro- 
ductive and highly imaginative recall, then, are the two 
extremes of the same scale between which are many  
-P-A-G-E-436
    418 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
gradations. Any form of thinking may be placed at some 
point on this scale. 
Controlled and Uncontrolled Thinking.—Dreaming is 
the extreme form of uncontrolled thinking. At the oppo- 
site extreme of this scale is highly controlled thinking 
typical of reasoning or creative imagination. Let us first 
give some details concerning the dream. 
Uncontrolled Thinking.—Dreaming, in the first place, 
is thinking, and it may be predominantly reproductive or 
highly imaginative. Reproductive dreaming would con- 
sist in recalling faithfully during sleep the events as they 
were experienced in the past. This form of dream is 
probably less usual than the fantastic dream, but mixed 
dreams, including the recall of real experiences together 
with more or less novel or absurd material, are frequent. 
The most striking difference between night dreams and 
daytime-reveries-is the convincing reality of the-former; 
it is imagination or recollection mistaken for real experi- 
ence. During the broodings of the day, consciousness is 
never so narrow and uninfluenced by sensory perceptions 
as in the dream. One may imagine he is floating above 
the housetop or singing to an enthusiastic audience by 
day, but he is simultaneously aware of visual, auditory, 
tactile and other impressions that belie the reality of the 
imaginings. In deep moments of imagination, the tinkle 
of the door bell, the rustle of a paper, or the odor of smoke 
may bring one completely to the perceptual present. In 
dreams, the contact with the external world, is largely 
cut off, consciousness is narrowed to a few ideas and these 
are unhampered either by the perceptual present or by 
the subtler mental processes, the critical, discriminative 
activities and attitudes that in waking hours operate so 
potently in the background of consciousness. In the 
dream, consciousness lacks breadth and depth; ideas fol-
-P-A-G-E-437
  REASONING AND IMAGINATION 419 
low one another by superficial associations rarely guided 
by any stable aim or purpose, rarely checked up as regards 
their congruity one with another, or with ordinary stand- 
ards of reasonableness or probability. The ideas in them- 
selves, not new, are linked together in unusual or absurd 
ways or appear in bizarre combinations that seem real 
only because mental activity as a whole is at such a low 
ebb. Dreams represent, then, the extreme of uncontrolled 
and uncriticised association of ideas. 
The motives effective in dreaming are not unlike those 
activating ordinary recollection or imaginative reverie. 
We dream of eating delicious foods, of winning prizes or 
acclaim, of attaining riches or of satisfying almost any 
positive desire. We experience dreams of the suffering- 
hero type also with its typical satisfaction. But in 
dreams, more than in recollection or daytime imagination, 
we experience the unpleasant; we dream of great misfor- 
tune encountered, of horrifying, terrifying and disgusting 
things and events. Now the explanation of the frequency 
of unpleasant dreams, as compared to imaginations and 
recollections, is precisely the same as the explanation of 
the illusory reality of the dream. Dreams are less well 
controlled, less-subject.to criticism, less easy to start, 
modify or halt. When the unpleasant recollection of a 
day dream begins, we switch our attention to something 
else and substitute a more pleasant line of thought. At 
night we lack control; a freakish train of thought getting 
under way commands the whole field of consciousness. We 
cannot penetrate its unreality; we cannot modify its 
course; we cannot stop it until we become more wakeful. 
Controlled Thinking.t-At the opposite extreme of 
dreaming, in which control by conscious aim or purpose 
is nearly zero, is highly controlled or selective thinking 
typical of reasoning or. creative | Between 
 
-P-A-G-E-438
( 
    420 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
the extremes are many stages; the confused thinking in 
the state of drowsiness or intoxication is near the dream 
state; the state of distraction or “absent mindedness,” in 
which one falls occasionally, is better controlled; ordinary 
reverie is still more thoroughly controlled; while alert, 
critical, concentrated activity in solving a problem or in 
creating a musical composition is highly controlled and 
selective. 
Just as any type of thinking may be classified as pre- 
dominantly reproductive or predominantly imaginative, 
any type may also be classified as high or low on the scale 
of control and selectivity. In the rare dream composed 
of recollections of real experiences, the thinking is repro- 
ductive but uncontrolled and unselective. It cannot be 
modified or stopped by our conscious efforts; it is quite 
as realistic as the imaginative dream and quite as un- 
manageable. Aimless reproductive recall during reverie 
like imaginative day dreams is much higher on the scale 
of control.| Recall for a definite purpose as during an 
examination or in solving a practical problem is regulated 
and selective, but no more so than during effort to con- 
ceive (imagine) a new costume design, cartoon, breakfast 
food, automobile engine, musical composition, or literary 
form.’) It is to the characteristics, limitations and possible 
improvements of the highly controlled forms of selective 
thinking, whether in reasoning or invention, in practical 
or in artistic lines, that most of this chapter will be 
devoted. 
Reasoning and Creative Imagination.—Reasoning is 
the term applied to highly purposeful, controlled, selec- 
tive thinking, predominantly of the reproductive type; 
creative imagination is the term applied to highly pur- - 
poseful, controlled, selective thinking of the imaginative 
type. In actual life, the two are very similar so far as
-P-A-G-E-439
REASONING AND IMAGINATION 421 
the actual mental activities involved are concerned even 
when we consider extreme examples of each type. Highly 
controlled and purposeful thinking, moreover, is rarely 
exclusively reproductive or imaginative, but shifts from 
one to the other constantly or lies between the two. For 
these reasons, it will be inadvisable at the outset to 
emphasize the distinctions too much. It will be prefer- 
able to take up several examples of actual purposeful and 
controlled thinking, pointing out the similarities and dif- 
ferences that appear. We shall begin with some illustra- 
tions of reasoning of the problem-solving type. 
REASONING AND ProsBiem SoLvING. 
The Characteristics of Reasoning.—Reasoning is a 
form of learning as well as a phase of thinking. It is a 
term applied to types of learning that are at once very 
subtle and very complex. Reasoning may be contrasted 
with all types of activity which consist merely in the 
repetition or recall of reactions previously acquired or 
in mere random or aimless activity. Typically, reasoning 
is involved when the individual ‘is confronted by a novel 
situation or a problem-situation for which his native and 
acquired modes of reaction do not at.once provide a satis- 
factory solution. The final or consummatory action is 
delayed and during the delay one must learn what to do. 
The process of learning what to do by reasoning is not, 
however, to be sharply distinguished from ordinary forms 
of trial-and-error learning. The two are similar but the 
extremes offer important contrasts. 
How Animals Solve Mechanical Problems.—Some of 
the characteristics of reasoning may be observed by com- 
paring the behavior of animals with those of men in 
problem-situations which enibrace comparable features. 
When a cat is placed in a puzzle box that may be opened 
 
-P-A-G-E-440
422 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
by some simple manipulation of buttons or latches, its 
activity seems to be mainly motor. It tries to squeeze 
between the bars, it claws or bites at buttons, wires, 
strings, and other objects. The activity is usually in- 
cessant; there is very little evidence that the animal 
thinks the problem over—at least, it does not appear to 
“stop and think.” It continues to try all of the forms of 
manipulation in its equipment, until finally the right 
move is hit upon, apparently by accident. When the cat 
is again placed in the box, it gives evidences of little 
understanding of the solution. It apparently does not 
know just how the previous escape was brought about. 
The task of learning the way out a second time is nearly 
as difficult as before. The solution is gradually acquired 
by a process of trials, elimination of annoying errors and 
the selection of the successful and hence satisfying 
reactions. 
How Some Men Solve Mechanical Problems.—The 
duplication of such an experiment with human subjects 
may be approximated by using a latch or some sort of 
mechanical puzzle which will be as new to the man as the 
puzzle box latch was to the cat. The general features of 
the learning by man are often very similar to those em- 
ployed by the animal. The former resorts at once to 
manipulation, turning the parts this way and that, twist- 
ing, pulling, pushing; sometimes repeating the same futile 
effort time after time—foolishly, one who knew the trick 
might say—sometimes shifting rapidly without apparent 
aim, sometimes retracing the old steps. In the course of 
these varied attempts the solution may be hit upon, 
often so unexpectedly that it is not understood at all. 
The second trial may then be much like the first; but at 
length the useless moves art eliminated while those con- 
stituting the solution are retained and perfected. This
-P-A-G-E-441
REASONING AND IMAGINATION 423 
example of learning we should be inclined to call a rather 
stupid human performance in which little, if any, rea- 
soning is involved. It is, nevertheless, a type of human 
learning that is not unusual when the problem is both 
novel and difficult. 
Reasoning in Solving Mechanical Problems.—Some 
learners, however, proceed in a different fashion. They 
manipulate less while observing and thinking more. 
Holding the puzzle before them, they carefully study its 
construction, estimate the results of various moves, and 
keep on the lookout for clues or suggestions. They may 
also attempt to recall the solutions of other puzzles or to 
apply general or particular facts learned from preceding 
experiences with door locks and other mechanical devices. 
The learner does more than merely manipulate the ob- 
ject; he recalls various facts which careful perception of 
the puzzle suggests and manipulates or explores among 
these ideas. There is an active search to link the present 
problem with past experiences which utilize the same 
principle. This tendency to utilize recalled facts in addi- 
tion to those that may be directly perceived in the 
problem-situation is one of the important characteristics 
of reasoning. ; 
In reasoning, we have not sidetracked the familiar trial- 
and-error procedure. We have merely widened the field 
of manipulation. Not énly may we explore among facts 
presented to the senses, but we may also explore among 
facts recalled. New facts may be observed not only in 
the situations present to the sense but in those present to 
mind. The recall of pertinent facts, general and particu- 
lar, is an effective way of bringing our past experiences to 
bear upon our present difficulties, The learner succeeds 
in recalling pertinent facts; in other words, his thinking 
is controlled and selective. He does not recall unrelated 
v  
-P-A-G-E-442
  424 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
and bizarre facts as in the dream; his purpose and aim 
facilitate some facts rather than others, although selec- 
tivity is rarely if ever perfect. 
The good reasoner not only recalls, but he carefully 
observes the present situation and his own reactions. The 
facts observed may be later recalled so that he can re- 
hearse the whole problem mentally, thus saving muscular 
work and often leading to a solution. Careful observa- 
tion, too, often enables him to recall the state of affairs 
which attends an accidental discovery of the solution, 
thus avoiding the common waste of effort shown by 
animals that hit upon the solution without having per- 
ceived it. The careful observer may recall the cireum- 
stances and his own reaction and thus “see” how it hap- 
pened or at least observe clues whose usefulness appears 
during the next trial, In ‘this, as in other typical in- 
stances of reasoning, thinking is highly active, controlled 
and selective. i 
Reasoning in Solving Verbal Problems.—These char- 
acteristics may be illustrated by the solution of verbal 
problems of the type similar to many that we solve in 
everyday life. It has been found experimentally that 
the problem below is of the degree of difficulty that taxes 
the ability of, but can be solved by, an average child of 
nine years. Be sure to solve the problem before reading 
the discussion which follows it. 
In cold, damp climates, root crops, like potatoes and turnips grow 
best; 
In temperate climates, there are abundant pastures, and oats and 
barley flourish; 
In sub-tropical climates, wheat, olives, and vines flourish; ‘ 
In tropical climates, date-palms and rice flourish; 
The ancient Greeks lived largely on bread, with oil for butter; 
they had wine to drink and raisins for fruit, 
Which climate do you think they had?
-P-A-G-E-443
  REASONING AND IMAGINATION 425 
To solve this problem, the child must first fix upon the 
main question, which requires some analysis. Out of the 
last two statements the “What climate did they have” 
statement must be combined with the notion of Greeks, 
so that the question becomes clearly “What climate did 
the Greeks have?” The solution will not be obtained 
unless this question is perceived and remembered. Next, 
information not contained in the problem-situation must 
be available and it must be suggested by getting the right 
facts together. The child must know that bread comes 
from wheat and not from root crops, potatoes, turnips, 
date-palms, etc. He must know also that oil comes from 
olives rather than oats, potatoes, rice, etc., and that 
raisins are to be associated with vines, rather than with 
date-palms, turnips, etc. These facts—assuming that 
they are known—must be brought out during a process 
of study in which many irrelevant matters are observed 
and discarded. Several erroneous hypotheses may be sug- 
gested as various facts are viewed together before the 
correct solution is obtained by narrowing the field down 
to the facts contained in lines 3, 5 and 6, and seeing the 
relations contained therein. In reasoning the solution of 
a verbal problem, then, we find the analysis of the gross 
situation into its elements, the supplementation of these 
minute facts by others recalled from past experience, and 
the perception of previously unobserved facts in new 
combinations of details. This last point merits some 
elaboration. i 
The Discovery of New Facts during Reasoning.— 
The result of observing many details and recalling many 
past experiences is the possibility of reacting to many 
selected situations operating at once. Solutions are dis- 
overed and new ideas or hypotheses conceived by getting 
ogether in a single moment of consciousness many aspects
-P-A-G-E-444
  426 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
of the present situation and of past situations more or 
less relevant. Sudden insights into the problem, sud- 
denly “getting a point,” seeing into or “seeing through,” 
suddenly conceiving a solution—these are other ways in 
which the culmination of reasoning is described. Per- 
haps the best general term with which to express the 
outcome of reasoning is hypothesis, inasmuch as the 
“idea” conceived is not always a real solution. It is a 
possible solution sometimes proving to be correct, some- 
times incorrect. In the latter case, the search is continued 
until other insights or hypotheses are achieved. The 
solution is an hypothesis which proves satisfactory. In 
difficult problems, the correct hypothesis may be preceded 
by many incorrect ones which are eliminated in the 
process of further study. 
An hypothesis is really a conscious response made to 
several features of the problem-situation and recalled 
ideas acting at once. While “seeing” many things at 
once, some facts contained in them or suggested by them 
come to mind. Such hypotheses and discoveries during 
the process of thought are much like the perception of a 
similarity or difference among several things observed at 
once. Indeed, such insights are a kind of perception, 
except that they may occur when the facts are not present 
to the sense but are only thought of or when perceived 
and recalled facts are combined. Many discoveries are 
made during reasoning because so many facts apparently 
remote and unrelated may be brought together in though 
that could not be brought together as things or events in| 
the actual world. Human ability to represent facts pre- 
viously experienced thus broadens greatly the opportunit 
to learn. This ability is, of course, the fundamental pre- 
requisite to reasoning. 
Recall is essential to reasoning, but reasoning at it
-P-A-G-E-445
  REASONING AND IMAGINATION 427 
best is more than mere recall; it is the “seeing” of new 
facts in those recalled or in the facts recalled combined 
with those perceived. It is the apprehension of facts not 
previously noted. Whether this result is called a percept, 
hypothesis, inference, insight or discovery matters little. 
The suddenness with which it appears, though a long 
period of exploration may have preceded it, is frequently 
characteristic. It seems virtually to “pop out.” Facts 
which amount to great discoveries are often finally “seen” 
with equal suddenness. To illustrate: “Hauy drops a 
bit of crystallized calcium spar, and looking at one of the 
broken prisms, cries out, ‘All is found!’ and immediately 
verifies his quick intuition in regard to the nature of 
crystallization.” + 
The world is full of facts awaiting someone sagacious 
enough to see them. The person who perceives them first 
makes a discovery and is quite properly accredited with 
genius. Others see them readily enough when they know 
hat to look for and how to look. This point is well 
illustrated by a story from the life of Darwin, in which 
e describes his observations of some natural phenomenon 
fter Agassiz’s discovery of evidence of a glacial period 
n prehistoric days. “We spent many hours in Cwm 
dwal, examining all the rocks with supreme care, as 
edgwick (another eminent scientist) was anxious to find 
ossils in them; but. neither of us saw a trace of the 
onderful glacial phenomena all about us; we did not 
otice the plainly scarred rocks, the perched boulders. 
. . Yet the phenomena are so conspicuous that... a 
ouse burnt down by fire did not tell its story more 
lainly than did this valley.” ?

Typres oF REASONING. 
The mental operations which comprise reasoning are 
essentially the same in the many varieties of problems 
that are encountered. Any situation which is at once 
novel and complex, whether in practical affairs, school 
subjects, religion, esthetics, music, or any other field, 
provides the occasion for reasoning. In addition to the 
problem-situation, there must be a motive. And the 
variety of motives is wide. We may reason just for the 
satisfaction in mastering a problem, although frequently 
the incentive is the desire to secure some end—food, com- 
fort, a fact needed in business—or to avoid some annoy- 
ance, such as confinement, deprivation, or thwarting. No 
convenient categories seem to include: all varieties of 
motives nor of problem-situations, but the following 
groups suggest types that are distinctive with respect to 
the general methods of procedure. 
1, Finding the Key to a Complex Situation.—Most of 
the practical problems fall under this head. Typically, 
the individual is confronted by a complex situation, which 
offers a large number of possible reactions. The question 
is to find the one satisfactory response, that is, the solu- 
tion, as when we encounter situations and ask such ques- 
tions as “What is this?” or “What is this for?” “How is 
it used?” “What does this mean?” “Where can my 
umbrella be?” “How did this get here?” or “How did you 
do that trick?” In all of these cases the number o: 
interpretations is legion. We must take them up on 
after another, try them out, reject useless clues, follo 
up promising lines, supplement them by recalling pas 
experiences and trust to getting together eventually th 
combination of details which will suggest the answer t 
our question. The solution of mechanical puzzles, th
-P-A-G-E-447

: pee AND IMAGINATION 429 
arch“for the cause of the balking of an automobile or 
the main point in a poem are of the same type. The 
essential characteristic of this type of reasoning is the 
presence of a large number of facts or details among which 
we find a satisfactory response. 
In the foregoing illustrations the solution was typically 
some concrete line of action or the perception of some 
particular fact which was the key to the situation. The 
so-called inductive reasoning so abundantly utilized in 
science is essentially the same, except that the key is 
usually a general rather than a particular fact. Science 
aims to discover laws, or general explanations. Thus 
Darwin, after observing a large number of variations 
mong animals of the same species, and similarities among 
different species which amounted to an essential con- 
tinuity, finally conceived a single explanation for all of 
these facts, namely, the theory of evolution. This theory 
‘was really a key to the complex situations, in much the 
same sense that after puzzling for a time with an arith- 
metic problem a child sees that the thing to do is first to 
add certain figures, and then subtract another figure from 
the sum. As a psychological process it makes little differ- 
ence whether the solution is a great law or a particular 
fact. : 
2. Application and Verification.—Reasoning may take 
its start from a general principle and seek for particular 
leases which illustrate it. One may attempt to apply a 
general law, either for the purpose of observing whether 
it holds good or not or for the purpose of understanding 
it better by practice in using it. If the interest is in test- 
ing the validity of a general statement, the process is 
called verification. If one does not question the general- 
ization but wishes to find new particulars which it covers, 
the term application is frequently used. In either case     
       
   
    
     
        
     
-P-A-G-E-448
   
  7 b 
430 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
the general fact becomes one element in the situation 
which must be grasped and held in mind while various 
concrete situations, perceived or thought of, are viewed 
with it. Getting the general and particular facts together, 
it is necessary to perceive their essential similarities or 
differences; to see whether they fit or are unrelated. Of 
course, there must be a great deal of exploration, trial- 
and-error activity, in recalling particular cases and trying 
them out. This form of thinking, of which there are 
several varieties, is called deductive reasoning in contrast 
to the inductive method, but both are essentially the same 
psychologically. Both imply a novel and complex situa- 
tion, a search for clues, the recall of facts and experiences, 
and the thinking of several things at once. | 
In many instances, both the inductive and deductive 
procedures are employed. In trying to figure out the use 
of a new piece of apparatus, a person may be led from 
the study of particular parts to an hypothesis concerning 
the whole and then attempt to verify the hypothesis by! 
applying it to the concrete situations which the theory 
suggests. In scientific investigations a general law, such) 
as the Law of Effect, which is arrived at after long study 
of particular events, is later tested by trying it out in 
new situations in which it should hold and it is finally] 
applied broadly to meet practical needs. On a smaller 
scale, laboratory experiments may include the same steps: 
discovery of the “key” or general law, then its verification 
and application. 
Criticism and Discrimination—In criticism and dis- 
crimination, which in some form is perhaps the most 
customary type of human reasoning, both the inductive 
and deductive features are apparent. In buying a hat, 
the purchaser usually becomes critical. She begins by 
analysis of the features of the hat, its predominant color,     
 
-P-A-G-E-449
PE ee Re ee ES Se eae ae 
REASONING AND IMAGINATION 431 
the color combination, the trimming, the quality of the 
materials, the size, shape and style. Not only may these 
features be viewed singly, but they must be viewed to- 
gether tc ascertain the general effects. Not only will 
there be search to perceive the character of the details 
and the general effect, but there will be considerations of 
these in the light of certain general ideas; there will be an 
application of principles. For example, she must be in 
style; therefore, she recalls the prevailing fashion and 
proceeds to observe the hat in the light of it. Is this hat 
a particular case of the accepted style? This question is 
really identical with that of the man of science when he 
inquired: “Is this a particular event covered by the Law 
of Effect?” The same is true of the buyer’s appraisal of 
the hat from the point of view of its appropriate price, or 
its fitness for her purpose, such as afternoon wear; or its 
harmony with the rest of her costume or her figure or 
complexion. Criticism of and discrimination among hats 
is, psychologically, no different from the work of the 
literary or musical critic, or from the evaluations in the 
moral, mechanical, legal, «esthetic or any other field of 
conscious activity. Criticism then is like other types of 
reasoning that have been or might be mentioned in the 
fact that it involves a problem-situation, the analysis of 
the whole into its details, the recall of related facts, gen- 
eral or particular, and the reaction to many things at 
once. Let us now take up creative imagination to ascer- 
tain in what respects, if any, it differs from reasoning.   
CrEATIVE IMAGINATION. 
The reasoning involved in criticism affords about the 
sharpest contrast, in certain respects, with creative imag- 
ination that may be found. Compare the music critic 
and composer. The music critic must be able to reason;
-P-A-G-E-450
ee ee ee Ce ne i Sena 
432 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
to analyze a composition, to classify and evaluate its 
elements in accordance with recognized norms of good 
usage, to see the similarities to, and differences from, other 
compositions, good and poor. Superficially, this type of 
thinking seems to be very different from that involved in 
creating a composition. The composer must imagine new 
things, not merely react to what is before him. To be 
sure, he utilizes recalled facts and must work, in his 
imagination, with musical notes. His work, however, is 
that of imagining new combinations of these notes; he 
must create. Perhaps many melodies come to him only 
to be discarded. They are discarded, however, in the 
light of some standard; because they fail to suit his 
purpose which may be to secure a new combination of a 
prescribed type. Really, the new combinations which 
occur to him are psychologically much like the “trials” of 
the person trying to solve a difficult mechanical puzzle 
or the insights of the mathematician working on a diffi- 
cult problem, or the hypotheses of a scientist searching 
for a general explanation of the movements of clouds or 
stars. The trial movements or insights or hypotheses are 
really new combinations of simpler movements, opera- 
tions or ideas, respectively, just as the tentative melody 
is a new combination of strains or notes. In all of these 
cases, moreover, the trial product must be evaluated in 
the light of other facts, rules, laws or standards of some 
sort. The test of the manipulative response is simply 
whether it unlocks the puzzle; the test of the mathema- 
tician’s insight is whether it produces the right answer; 
the test of the scientist’s hypothesis is less precise and 
final, but it must explain all of the facts, must explain 
them in the simplest way and must be consistent with 
explanations in related fields. The test of the musical 
composition is still less rigid and conclusive, but it must  
-P-A-G-E-451
    REASONING AND IMAGINATION 433 
observe certain accepted standards of harmony, rhythm 
and originality. In this respect it is much like the choice 
of a hat; the one chosen must obey certain general re- 
quirements, but many different hats might do so quite 
satisfactorily. Thus the distinctions between types of 
reasoning and creative imagination are not so clear as 
they may appear at first sight. They are practical rather 
than psychological. The field of purposive, controlled, 
selective thinking is as broad as the world of facts that 
may be perceived or imagined but the characteristics of 
purposive thinking are very much alike whatever the pur- 
pose, the kind of facts utilized, the character of the 
products or the nature of the tests of validity applied. 
THE ImpRoveMENT oF MernHops oF REASONING AND 
IMAGINING. 
With the characteristics of reasoning and creative 
imagination now before us, we may undertake a discus- 
sion of the equipment essential to good selective thinking, 
the methods by which and the extent to which it may be 
improved. 
The Need of Facts.—Successful reasoning and imagin- 
ation depends upon an abundance of ideas,. particular 
and general facts and principles. In reasoning, we pick 
and choose among facts, view this and that together. 
Few people are able to reason about the Theory of Rela- 
tivity, Evolution, or Electro-therapy because of a lack of 
the essential stock of facts. And some who could reason 
well concerning the explanation, application, or verifica- 
tion of these theories, might reason very poorly about a 
balking automobile, investment securities or pains in the 
chest, because of lack of information concerning me- 
chanics, finance or the diagnosis of disease. Unless the 
person has had previous experience with a situation in 
 
-P-A-G-E-452
    434 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
some degree similar, unless he has dealt with material of 
the same sort before, he may be quite incapable of finding 
a solution except by accident. An eminent thinker once 
compared the situation during reasoning to two cham- 
bers, a main chamber in which manipulation and study 
were going on, or in which the leading ideas were being 
rehearsed and an antechamber crowded with ideas seek- 
ing an entrance to the main room. Unless the antecham- 
ber were well filled little could be done. The most hope- 
ful sign of probable success was an anteroom teeming 
with candidates for a “trial.” If we are to become com- 
petent thinkers in any line, the first, and by all odds the 
most important thing is to accumulate experience and 
master the facts in the field. Without the facts and ex- 
perience, the most gifted mind would be helpless. The 
most productive thinkers are not those who disregard the 
knowledge, methods, trials and errors of others, but those 
who are most familiar with them. Originality or creative 
imagination is not opposed to the amassing of facts or 
the laws of ordinary learning, but dependent upon them. 
Originality in Art.—In thinking in the fields of literary, 
musical and other artistic productions, familiarity with 
the products and techniques of the masters seems to be 
quite as useful as acquaintance with the facts is essential 
to originality in other fields. In the esthetic fields the 
fear that. familiarity with other products may cramp or 
inhibit originality seems to be more frequently and ten- 
aciously held than in business, mechanics or science, but 
for no good reason. In the better types of instruction in 
composition, drawing, design and the like more attention 
is given than formerly to study of good products, to 
theory and technique. Originality is fed by such equip- 
ment; starved by poverty of examples and precedents. 
Keeping the Problem in Mind.—Given an abundance
-P-A-G-E-453
  REASONING AND IMAGINATION 435 
of information with which to work, the first step in solv- 
ing a problem is to understand thoroughly and remember 
the question or problem set up. 
The problem held clearly in mind acts as a selective 
agency during the activities of reasoning. It tends to 
favor the perception of the facts appropriate to the solu- 
tion of the problem. The successful thinker finds that 
out of the variety of possible meanings which each detail 
may yield, the right ones appear. Others find that the 
right suggestion will not come. Tell a subtle joke to any 
group of people; some will see the point at once, but to 
others it comes slowly or not at all. When the right idea 
does not come, one is not left altogether helpless. One 
should not passively wait for something to come. Success 
may be achieved by instigating certain maneuvers. 
A Systematic Analysis of Details.—The first maneuver 
is to proceed with the main question in mind and to 
examine actively the problem in piecemeal. Focus atten- 
tion on one detail. Significant matters overlooked when 
the problem is thought of as a whole may be detected 
during an active study of one phase after another. In 
teaching, the habit of analytic scrutiny may be encour- 
aged by questions directed to parts of the problem. 
Systematic procedure in which details are taken up in 
orderly fashion, their relation to the problem ascertained 
and futile leads noted, should be cultivated by means of 
practice under guidance. 
One trait, antagonistic to successful reasoning, is in- ° 
flexibility. In attempting to solve a mechanical puzzle, a 
subject observed (by Ruger) spent ten hours on one line 
of attack. After having stated his assumption, which was 
an erroneous one, the subject was requested to strike out 
along other lines. Aften an hour and a quarter, he was 
asked again to tell what he was doing. He was still work-   
 
-P-A-G-E-454
  436 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
ing on the same futile clue! This kind of stubbornness, 
or inflexibility is a fatal obstruction in the pathway of 
reason, and is reminiscent of the logic-tight compartments 
mentioned in Chapter IX. Originality, fertility and effi- 
ciency in thinking depend, in some degree, upon habits 
of openmindedness, of keeping alive to a wide variety of 
stimuli and of remaining sensitive to all of the suggestions 
that a situation may contain rather than in thinking only 
along the line most readily suggested. 
Some subjects show a tendency to skip about among 
the details of a problem in a superficial fashion, which is 
quite as serious a fault as too great a tenacity in sticking 
to a few clues. A promising line is undertaken and fol- 
lowed up for a while, only to be suddenly dropped as 
another suggestion occurs. This kind of learner is too 
readily distracted; he is continually getting very “warm” 
but by hastiness is robbed of a victory almost within his 
grasp. A similar defect in thinking is the superficial 
impulsive acceptance of any conclusion which comes to 
mind, obvious among most children and many adults. 
There seems to be a native disposition to accept as reliable 
any idea that comes easily. While guessing is to be 
encouraged and while it is in general advisable to enter- 
tain suggestions that thinking produces, it is quite as 
desirable to establish habits of maintaining a state of 
doubt, of being critical and of testing suggestions before 
they are accepted. 
“Scatter-brain” and impulsive thinking and inflexibil- 
ity may to some extent be remedied by cultivating the 
habit of systematic procedure coupled with efforts to 
formulate articulate hypotheses concerning the solution. 
Teachers may assist by asking the pupil, “What is your 
problem?” “What facts are you now considering?” 
“What do you think is a possible solution?” The learner
-P-A-G-E-455
  REASONING AND IMAGINATION 437 
should work, not aimlessly waiting for things to happen, 
but with a definite question or assumption in mind. Each 
assumption should be tested until its worth is determined 
beyond a reasonable doubt, then dropped and another 
taken up, until one by one the possibilities are exhausted. 
Such a procedure tends, for one thing, to narrow the field 
of operations. If the solution does not show itself spon- 
taneously, it may be finally cornered and thus captured. 
Changes in the assumptions widen the possibilities for 
suggestions since the same details may be perceived differ- 
ently as words may have different meanings when the 
point of view is changed. Solutions coming as the answer 
to the question or in the course of the testing of a 
hypothesis are better understood than those which “just 
come.” If the solution is anticipated and linked with an 
assumption it is .better observed and comprehended. 
Usually an assumption grows out of past experience which 
is formulated as a general rule or principle. The present 
solution is then perceived as a case which fits into a 
familiar type. 
Generalization.—The subject, then, should study ae 
tails in connection with the main problem, attempt to 
guess the solution as he goes along, give each guess a fair 
tryout and advance systematically. When the problem 
is solved it is advisable frequently to review some of the 
steps in an effort to generalize or get the principle of the 
problem. The value of generalization was shown very 
clearly in the studies of mechanical puzzles, as indicated 
in the following quotation from Ruger: “A certain puzzle 
was so arranged that it could be presented in various 
forms. The manipulation for these various forms could 
all be comprised under a single formula. This general 
formula could be deduced from any one of these special 
forms. A number of subjects were tried with the puzzle. 
   
-P-A-G-E-456
    438 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
As soon as skill was acquired in dealing with one form 
of the puzzle it was changed to another form. The sub- 
jects who developed the general formula during the solu- 
tion of the first form were able to use in the second form 
the specialized habits built up in the first form. Those 
who formed merely the special habits without developing 
the principle attempted to carry over the habits without 
modification and were greatly embarrassed by the 
change.” The good thinker not only solves his problems 
but explains the solution in terms of some general for- 
mula or principle. 
The suggestions thus far made concerning methods of 
improving reasoning are drawn from experimental studies 
of children and adults in solving various types of prob- 
lems. There are two other sources of suggestions con- 
cerning methods of thinking: the facts of logic and the 
reported experiences of great thinkers. Let us see what 
may be learned from these sources. 
The Study of Logic.—Logic is the study of the out- 
lines of representative forms of reasoning. Logic is not 
much concerned with the processes of reasoning, that is, 
the difficulties of keeping the problem in mind, the futile 
moves, etc. It is concerned with the validity of the 
results reached—whether the solution is justified or not. 
Logic is related to reasoning in much the same way that 
grammar is related to composition. The study of grammar 
will do little to develop skill or style in writing, but it 
will assist in the task of detecting correct and incorrect 
usages and enable the learner to repeat the former and 
avoid the latter. Similarly, logic may assist in indicating 
forms of thought that are valid and invalid. 
In logic, samples of reasoning are analyzed into their 
elements, which are usually displayed in a simple graph, 
diagram or short series of sentences. These summaries
-P-A-G-E-457
    REASONING AND IMAGINATION 439 
make more apparent various fallacies that. were obscure 
when expressed in cumbersome or expansive verbal form. 
The various correct and incorrect forms of reasoning may 
also be classified in several types. Once an effective 
classification is made, reference and interpretation may 
be facilitated. 
Properly utilized, knowledge of logic—especially of the 
common fallacies in thought—may be of some value in 
developing more valid and rigorous habits. But like rules 
in grammar, principles of logic may be learned quite 
independently of the activities they are supposed to assist. 
They may be memorized but insufficiently applied. To 
be effective, they must be introduced during concrete ex- 
periences. They must be illustrated by and fused with 
the activities of reasoning. 
The Study of Methods Used by Great Thinkers.— 
Men and women of eminence in fields of reasoning, crea- 
tive imagination and invention sometimes undertake to 
describe the general methods used or the detailed steps 
found in some phase of their work. Such accounts differ 
widely both in validity and suggestiveness. In the main, 
great thinkers, composers, artists, inventors really do not 
know how their results are achieved in anything ap- 
proaching detail. As in reading or singing, playing the 
violin, perceiving distance or traits of character, it is one 
thing to be a good performer and quite another to know 
how the ability was acquired or how the performance now 
goes on. One rarely knows. The usual accounts, there- 
fore, are more likely to be rationalization than genuine 
observations, comparable with the familiar magazine 
accounts of “How I Lived to Be a Hundred Years Old.” 
They are likely to be full of erroneous ideas and lacking 
at the really vital points. Indeed, the happenings at the 
vital moments of reasoning or imaginative thinking are
-P-A-G-E-458
  440 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
so complex and subtle that they scarcely permit 
analysis. 
The Need of Practice under Guidance.—Learning to 
think, reason, or imagine creatively is, after all, similar 
to the task of learning to whistle, read or pitch in base- 
ball. General directions of value may be given, the gross 
features of good and bad procedure may be portrayed or 
explained, something can be learned by observing the 
work of others directly or as reported, but there remains 
a vast number of subtle techniques, devices, “tricks of 
the trade,” that are very difficult to identify. The pro- 
ficient performer does not appreciate them himself. They 
differ greatly, moreover, from person to person. These 
unanalyzable techniques, unfortunately for the learner, 
are likely to be of extreme importance. The only way to 
secure them is through abundant practice, especially 
practice carefully observed by an expert teacher or care- 
fully studied by the learner himself, or both. Just as we 
learn to sing only by singing, we learn to think by think- 
ing, and we learn to create by creating. And just as we 
may “practice errors” in singing, we are likely to estab- 
lish bad habits of solving problems, sifting data or pro-— 
ducing literary compositions. In learning to think as in 
other types of learning, abundant practice carefully 
checked up is the most productive source of improvement.

What facts presented in Chapters I and X bear upon the study 
of reasoning? 
Does the average farmer, chauffeur, stenographer, salesman, 
cobbler, housewife, physician, or banker reason very much? 
After several years of experience in any of these vocations, is it 
more or less necessary to reason in order to get along efficiently 
than at the beginning? After several years is one more or less 
able to reason in that field? ’ 
How often do you reason when it is not necessary or “for the 
fun of it”? Just what is “the fun” of it? Has it an instinctive 
basis? 
Criticise or defend these statements: “Necessity is not the 
mother of invention. Knowledge of previous inventions is the 
mother; original ability is the father.” (From E. L. Thorn- 
dike. The Psychology of Arithmetic, p. 278.) 
State your opinion on these assertions: (a) We require in gen- 
eral too much learning by rote in our schools and colleges; (b) 
If we clutter the child’s mind with memorized facts we interfere 
with his thinking; (c) It is not that too much is memorized, but 
rather too little; (d) It is not that too much is memorized, but 
that unessential material is learned; (e) Not too much mem- 
orization, but memorization in ineffective ways. 
Of the various suggestions offered for the improvement of 
reasoning, which do you consider most important? Which least 
important? Why? 
Which is more likely to stimulate a high-school boy to think — 
the study of formal logic-or a serial detective story? Will 
either improve ability to reason in general? What material 
would be better than either? 
If you were trying to encourage students to attempt to think, 
to invent, create, solve problems—would you choose tasks very 
easy or very hard or moderately hard. Why? Compare with 
your choice of opponents in wrestling, tennis, etc. Is there any 
basis of comparison here? If so, what?

  CHAPTER XV 
MENTAL ORGANIZATION AND THE TRANSFER 
OF TRAINING 
Under the terms attention, perception, memory, rea- 
soning, imagination, a number of facts concerning human 
behavior and the processes of learning have been pre- 
sented in preceding chapters. There remains, however, 
the need of surveying more critically the nature of these 
functions, their relations to each other and the influence 
of training upon them. 
THEORIES CONCERNING MrentTAt Processzs. 
The Theory of Mental Faculties—There are many 
theories concerning the nature of such processes as percep- 
tion and memory, and the character of their interrela- 
tions. We shall be able to consider only the two main 
types of theories, giving no details concerning the several 
particular hypotheses of each type. One theory, old in 
the history of philosophy and science and now highly 
popular in other circles, js the theory of mental faculties. 
According to this theory attention, memory, perception, 
reason, imagination, and sometimes others such as the 
will, judgment, and discrimination art powers or faculties 
of the mind. Usually the faculties are held to be mainly 
if not wholly independent of each other. The mind is the 
sum of the actions of the several faculties. The faculty 
is a general power or capacity, moreover, which operates 
indiscriminately in all lines and on all kinds of material.

Individuals are assumed to have good, medium, or bad. 
memories, judgments or wills; it is implied that these 
traits are about equally good or bad in all situations. 
Memory, to be concrete, is the power of acquiring facts. 
If you have a good memory everything is easily learned; 
if your memory is bad, all facts are acquired with diffi- 
culty. Those who held this view usually made the 
assumption that the various faculties could be improved 
by training. And when this opinion was held, it was 
necessary to make the further assumption that the faculty 
or power is trained as a whole. If memory was improved 
by training of one sort or on some one material, it would 
be improved for work on other kinds of data and in other 
situations. 
If a psychologist were devoted to this view his proce- 
dure in diagnosis of a student’s difficulties, for example, 
would consist of a survey of the several faculties. The 
trouble might be in attention, perception, memory, will, 
reasoning, imagination, or some other power, or in sev- 
eral of these. Having found the deficient faculty 
prescriptions for special training of that faculty would be 
given. Various subjects or systems of training have 
always been suggested for improving each faculty. For 
example, educational authorities less than 25 years ago 
offered special school subjects as a means of improving 
certain faculties. These quotations indicate the prevalent 
point of view. Study of German “trains the reason, the 
powers of observation, comparison and synthesis.” “The 
pursuit of mathematics gives command of attention” and 
results in “the strengthening and training of the reason- 
ing powers.” “Will-power and attention are educated by 
physical training. When developed by any special act, 
they are developed for all acts.” There have always been 
individuals, moreover, who believed that courses of train- 
 
-P-A-G-E-465
  MENTAL ORGANIZATION 447 
ing utilizing materials of a special sort different from the 
regular academic subjects would be even more effective 
as a means of developing the faculties. Such systems for 
training memory, concentration, will-power, and the like 
are now widely advertised. 
The Theory of Mental Functions.—Opposed to the 
faculty theory. is the view that the organism deals pri- 
marily as a whole with each of the innumerable situations, 
problems, and classes of data that it encounters. In this 
view, attention, memory, perception, reasoning, etc., are 
conceived merely as aspects of the whole process of deal- 
ing with a particular situation. Attention, perception, 
etc., do not refer to powers or faculties but rather they 
are to be thought of as abstractions, that is, not as real 
entities which can exist alone but merely as integral 
phases of a larger process, namely, the adjustment of the 
whole organism. According to this view, learning is re- 
acting in a complex way to some situation or data. What 
one learns is to react to or deal with particular data. 
Training, then, will not necessarily result in general im- 
provement of attention, memory, or any other power, but 
in improved adjustment to some situation or in increased 
ability to deal in some given way with one type of data. 
If there is a transfer of improvement from.one type of 
work, or from one situation, to others, it must be due to 
the presence of some common or identical elements among 
the several types of work or situations. This view may 
be called the Theory of Mental Functions. 
How shall we decide between these two general views? 
One way would be to take up representative samples of 
human activities and analyze them into their elements; 
o take perception, for example, and see whether it is 
ally distinct and independent of other “faculties” such 
attention or memory. Another way would be to test 
 
-P-A-G-E-466
  448 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
the theory by conducting experimental studies of the 
amount and nature of the transfer of training. For- 
tunately a very large amount of experimental work of 
this sort has been done. Let us first indicate the trend of 
findings from these investigations and later return to a 
discussion of the theories. 
EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING. 
Transfer of Training in Memory.—William James in 
1890 was the first to attack the problem of memory train- 
ing experimentally. James and four of his students each 
ascertained the time required to memorize material from 
one author, such as a section of Victor Hugo’s Satyr, and 
then after spending about 20 minutes per day for a month 
or more learning material from another author, they 
again memorized passages from the Satyr. Three of the 
four students showed improvement while the other stu- 
dent and James himself found no transfer. These experi- 
ments were really too crude to be conclusive but they are 
of historical significance since they stimulated further 
experimental studies by methods more refined. 
A later experiment gave more clearcut results. Students 
were first tested in learning one kind of material and 
then, after an average of about 20 minutes’ practice per 
day for an average of 20 days on another kind of material 
were given a test on the same kind of material as orig- 
inally learned. The improvements in memorizing the 
material specially practiced and in the material memo- 
rized but once before and again after the practice period 
are given in the table on the following page. 
The table disclosed a marked improvement in ability 
to memorize the kind of material practiced. The total 
time of practice was not great—from six to seven hours— 
and no special instructions, guidance or economical proce-

dures were suggested, yet by mere practice alone the time 
required to learn a given amount is reduced at least 
50 per cent; in one case by 82 per cent. The im- 
provement transferred to memorizing another type of 
material was relatively small. Methods of memorizing 
Victor Hugo’s writings are not identical with methods of" 
memorizing Browning; learning to memorize French 
vocabularies helps somewhat to memarize French verse: 
but helps very little to memorize English verse; learning 
better’ to memorize Paradise Lost helps not at all to 
memorize chemical formulae. In these results it does not 
appear that memory is a faculty that operates indis- 
criminately on all kinds of materials or a power that may 
be trained in general by exercise on any kind of material. 
In one respect the experiment just mentioned is un- 
satisfactory/ So rapidly do people often increase in 
ability to léarn by specific practice that in a second test 
they are usually better than in the first. Part of the 
improvement attributed to transfer in this study—as the- 
investigator himself pointed out—is really due to specific 
practice during the two tests, the one before and one after 
practice on the different material. It is probable there--
-P-A-G-E-468
450 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
fore that the transfer is less than here indicated and in 
some instances it may be actually a loss rather than a 
small or zero gain. 
A better experimental technique consists in using what 
is called a “control” individual or group of individuals by 
means of whom the gains due to practice during the pre- 
liminary and final “transfer” test may be measured and 
subtracted. This procedure is illustrated in the following 
study: A group of women students were divided into four 
sub-groups. Group 1, a “control” group receiving no 
special training; Group 2 learned from 30 to 60 lines of 
poetry daily (30 minutes a day for 12 days); Group 3 
memorized tables, such as population data, export and 
import tables, and foreign coinage systems 30 minutes a 
day for 12 days; Group 4 spent 30 minutes a day for 12 
days attempting to learn the substance of scientific, his- 
torical or narrative prose selections read to them. Just 
before and just after the practice series, the abilities of 
all four groups were measured in the following kinds of 
learning: 
1. Learning series of names and dates given orally. 
2. Learning series of non-sense syllables given orally. 
8. Memorizing pieces of poetry, read by the experi- 
menter and repeated by the subjects. 
4, Memorizing prose, as in (3) verbatim. 
5. Getting the substance of a prose selection presented 
orally. i 
‘6. Memorizing a series of 9 letters read but once. 
By comparing the improvement of each of the practice 
groups in each function with that of the control group, 
the transfer of training was measured. The results, 
briefly, were as follows: Each group gained rapidly in 
the kind of learning specifically practiced. The influence  
-P-A-G-E-469
  MENTAL ORGANIZATION 451 
of training in one type of learning on other types was 
‘sometimes favorable, sometimes unfavorable. Practice in 
memorizing poetry produced some improvement in learn- 
ing tables, non-sense, and prose literally, but a loss in 
ability to learn prose substance or recall letters. Those 
who practiced learning tables were more able to learn 
tables, prose substance and non-sense, but less able to 
learn poetry, prose verbatim and recall letters. Practice 
in getting the substance of prose had a bad effect upon 
all other forms of memorizing save the “immediate” 
memory for series of 9 letters.. Transfer may be positive 
or it may be negative. Practice in one kind of learning 
may facilitate or it may inhibit other kinds of learning 
within the same general field. 
Other investigations of the effects of the training of 
memory for one kind of material have shown a transfer 
of improvement to memorizing other kinds of material 
that is seldom great, usually between 5 and 15 per cent. 
Often it is less than 5 per cent and occasionally zero or 
negative. 
The Transfer of Training in Perception.—One of the 
earliest experiments on transfer in the field of perception 
was performed in 1903 (by Thorndike and Woodworth). 
They found that subjects who had practiced estimating 
the areas of rectangles of certain sizes (10 to 100 square 
centimeters) until large improvement had been attained, 
showed only about a third as great improvement when 
slightly larger rectangles (150 to 300 square centimeters) 
were given or when the areas were kept constant but the 
shapes changed. These investigators also found that a 
period of training which brought about considerable im- 
provement in judging the lengths of lines from one-half 
to one and one-half inches in length yielded no increase 
in ability to estimate lines from six to twelve inches long.
-P-A-G-E-470
  452 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
It was found that individuals who by practice had 
markedly increased their ability to pick out words con- 
taining the letters e and s showed less than one-third as 
much improvement in marking words containing 7 and ¢, 
sand p,canda,aandn, orlando. Training in perceiv- 
ing English verbs gave a reduction in time of 21 per cent, 
but when the same subjects were tested in perceiving 
other parts of speech they showed a reduction in time of 
but 3 per cent and an increase in omissions of more than 
100 per cent. Another investigator (Kline) gave nine 
individuals practice in canceling c’s and t’s from 30 to 45 
minutes a day for 14 days. Before and after the practice, 
the subjects were tested in cancelling nouns, verbs, 
prepositions, pronouns, and adverbs. Eight other indi- 
viduals, who served as a control group, were given the 
same initial and final tests, but received no practice in 
cancelling c’s and t’s. On the final tests the practice 
group showed less ability in cancelling nouns, verbs, etc., 
than the control group. Apparently, practice in cancel- 
ling letters may cause not an improvement but a decrease 
in ability to cancel words of certain types. 
The Transfer of Training in Reasoning.—An experi- 
ment (by Briggs) was designed to test the hypothesis that 
reasoning, trained in one field, would be improved for 
work in other fields. The study was designed specifically 
to test the view, very widely accepted at one time, that 
rigid training in reasoning in formal grammar would in- 
crease in other fields the abilities— 
1. To test reasons. 
2. (a) To take from a mass of data all that are neces- 
sary and to use them in reaching a con- 
clusion. 
(b) To demand all necessary data before drawing 
a conclusion. 
 
-P-A-G-E-471
  - MENTAL ORGANIZATION 453 
To reason syllogistically. 
To detect “catches.” 
To see likenesses and differences. 
To test critically definitions of all sorts. PoP ow 
Fifty-four tests were devised to measure, in some form, 
each of these and certain similar abilities. They were 
given to children in each grade from 2 to 7 in an ele- 
mentary school. Each class was then divided into two 
divisions. Division I, three times a week for three months 
was taught formal grammar, while Division II worked 
on composition and language. At the end of the three 
months’ period, both divisions were given a series of tests 
similar to the first series. After these tests Division II 
was taught grammar for three months while Division I 
studied composition and language. At the end of this 
period the first series of tests was again given to all. 
Two comparisons of a group studying grammar with a 
non-grammar group were thus secured. Moreover, the 
gain in the general ability in each group during the three 
months of grammar study may be compared with the gain 
made by the same group during the three months during 
which no grammar was studied. 
This investigation showed improvement in the abilities 
to deal with the subject matter of grammar but very little 
transfer of abilities to other situations. On the whole, the 
influence of the training on reasoning, seeing likenesses 
and differences, testing definiteness, seeing “catches,” etc., 
in other fields was scarcely perceptible. 
Conclusions.—The many studies of transfer, of which 
we have given but a sampling, indicate in general the 
following facts: 
1. The effect of training in one type of memory or 
perception or reasoning is usually a marked in- 
crease in the specific function trained.
-P-A-G-E-472
ee ee ee ee 
| 454 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
2. Arelatively small improvement in memorizing, etc., 
when the form of learning or the material learned 
is different, even if only slightly different. 
8. Complete absence of transfer and negative transfer 
—that is, a loss of efficiency in one function due 
to improvement in another—occasionally. 
Taken together, the results of experimental studies on 
the transfer of training are rather antagonistic to the 
faculty theory. The facts of transfer cannot be explained 
as general all-round improvement of mental powers such 
as memory, perception or reasoning for the reason that 
the improvement is not uniform. 
Tue Factors WHIcH TRANSFER FROM ONE SITUATION 
To OTHERS. 
The effects of training in one situation do manifestly 
often transfer to others. The effects which transfer some- 
times increase and at other times decrease efficiency in 
the new situation. The nature of transfer cannot be 
accounted for in terms of improved faculties but it must 
be explained in some way. The proper explanation may 
appear in a study of the character of factors which do 
transfer, and in surveying these factors the inadequacy of 
the faculty doctrine will appear more clearly. 
The Transfer of Methods of Reacting.—During prac- 
tice in memorizing, for example, a subject may learn a 
variety of methods of attack upon the particular subject 
matter, as lists of 12 non-sense syllables. He may learn 
to use a rhythm such as —'U |—’U which is often a 
useful device. When he changes to the study of lists of 
words, the general problem, 12 items in a list to learn, 
may call into use the rhythmic division of the items. In 
this case, the use of the same rhythm probably would be  
-P-A-G-E-473
  MENTAL ORGANIZATION 455 
useful but it might be a disadvantage in learning prose 
or poetry. which has a different rhythm. Again, the sub- 
ject may hit upon the device of learning by the whole 
rather than the part method, and this may be carried 
over. He may find that searching for peculiar syllables 
to serve as landmarks is profitable and this device may be 
used on other materials, in some cases advantageously, in 
others not. From experience he may find that, in spite 
of his initial doubts, his memory is not so bad, and this 
feeling of confidence may recur whenever. any task of 
memorizing is presented. He may actually acquire 
greater fondness for trying his skill in memorizing and 
this satisfaction may be experienced in learning new ma- 
terials. On the other hand, he may acquire habits of 
using ineffective associations, of disliking such work, of 
doubting his capacity to improve and, when transferred, 
these habits would interfere with achievement on new 
data. What is carried over, then, is not an improved 
faculty of memory, but a group of new devices, ideas, 
attitudes—in a word, a new technique, which may be 
good or bad in whole or in parts. Habits acquired in one 
type of memorizing, however, are by no means invariably 
carried over. The change from non-sense syllables in a 
list to digits in a row, or to isolated names and dates, or to 
prose and poetry may offer so few common elements that 
the subject starts almost anew to acquire a technique 
fitting the new material. 
Unconscious Transfer of Methods and Movements.— 
Some of, the reactions carried over from one function to 
another are not consciously identified or appreciated. In 
memorizing, students are often unaware of just what 
devices they are using, much less of the circumstances 
under which they were originally acquired. If one prac- 
tices hand ball for several years before taking up tennis,
-P-A-G-E-474
456 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
it will probably be found that the ability to follow the 
course of the ball, to estimate bounding, and to make 
many adjustments of the body, carry over advan- 
tageously, while other transferred habits, such as hitting 
with a snap instead of with a swing may be disadvan- 
tageous. Some of the conditions of the new situation 
elicit reactions previously made to identical conditions in 
old situations. In a genuine sense they make the subject 
react as he does without awareness, necessarily, on his 
part of how or why. Similarly, improvement in ability 
to memorize, observe, or reason consists in a large meas- 
ure in the development of a number of little tricks of 
method usually poorly analyzed and poorly understood 
by the learner, but activated by the common elements of 
the different situations. 
The Transfer of Facts or Information.—In the same 
category with specific movements, methods of attack, 
emotional and other attitudes, may be included acquired 
reactions constituting information or subject matter. 
During the study of arithmetic, history, or spelling, one 
may memorize, perceive, and reason; but in addition to 
the training in these processes one acquires information. 
Facts learned in one situation may transfer like other 
reactions, in the sense that they may be utilized in other 
situations. That knowledge or subject matter is subject 
to transfer in the same way as movements, devices of 
learning and general attitudes, must be made clear, since 
it is frequently assumed that a fact, once learned, is of 
universal application—that it floats freely in the mind, 
ready for use in any situation. 
Suppose, for example, that a child unfamiliar with 
division learns the following tables as they are printed: 
Z 
 
-P-A-G-E-475
       
  
Hot dl So 
RwDe    Will the facts of simple division now be available for 
widespread use? No, they certainly will not. Further 
practice must be given in mixed orders, to insure the 
learning of the items independently rather than as lists; 
for example: 
B 2+-2=1 
6+—3=2 
10+—5=2 
10+2=5 
  When the pupil has mastered these items, he may be 
unable to solve such problems as the following: 
Cc 10-— 5s 
12= 2s 
6= 3s 
While the same 10 — 5 = etc., is involved, the situation 
in general is so different that transfer seldom occurs. The 
child does not recognize these forms as problems in 
division. Specific practice having been given in the 
forms above, will the pupil now be able to compute such 
problems as these? 
D 10 Cents = Nickels. 
25 Cents = Nickels. 
Assuming that they have not previously learned specifi- 
cally to compute with money, many children will not 
make this transfer. Or consider the following: 
E 5 cents pays one car fare 
15 cents pays car fares 
45 cents pays car fares
-P-A-G-E-476
  458 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
F For 5 cents you can buy 1 small loaf of bread 
For 25 cents you can buy small loaves of bread 
G How many -5¢ balls can you buy with 30¢? 
How many 5¢ balls can you buy with 10¢? 
With the tables perfectly learned, pupils fail to solve 
such problems as E, F, and G. The difficulty is that 
while the arithmetical computations are the same in the 
several problems, the common elements in the situation 
are so obscured by other details that they do not become 
potent except perhaps in the case of a few of the very 
bright pupils. Facts, in arithmetic or other subjects, 
cannot be acquired in any one situation in such form as 
to be generally applicable or transferable. A thoroughly 
“abstracted” notion of subtraction, or, in other words, 
generally applicable facility, is the outcome of acts of 
identifying and practicing subtraction in a wide variety 
of typical situations. To have a general notion of 
“division” means to be able to realize that this, and this, 
and this is a case where one should divide. To have a 
general appreciation of justice or a triangle is to become 
aware, on facing each relevant situation, that it contains 
the abstract element in question. In all of these situa- 
tions we respond to a common, but subtle element. 
The Transfer of General Attitudes and Ideals.—Along 
with movements, methods of attack, emotional attitudes 
and information which may transfer, are more general 
adjustments which may be called attitudes or ideals. 
Tendencies to maintain calm or to become nervous, to 
work rapidly or slowly, to work accurately or carelessly, 
to be self-conscious or absorbed in the task, to be honest 
or cheat—these, acquired in one situation, may be revived 
in others. The “problem,” “practical,” “scientific,” or 
“artistic” attitude may indeed be built up to a very wide
-P-A-G-E-477
  MENTAL ORGANIZATION - 499 
applicability. But in so far as these tendencies are gen- 
eral, they result. from widespread experience, from the 
acquisition of habits in each of many fields, and seldom 
are they, strictly speaking, universal, as the relative in- 
capacity of most people to deal “practically” or “scien- 
tifically” with many problems outside their own field 
attests. Even such traits as thoroughness or honesty are 
not to be found universally or not at all in a person’s be- 
havior. On the contrary, they are associated with and 
aroused by a particular number of situations in the case 
of each individual. 
The facts of transfer contain certain implications con- 
cerning methods of developing mental abilities and cer- 
tain implications concerning the nature of the mental 
functions. We shall take these up in turn. 
Some PracticaL APPLICATIONS OF THE Facts oF 
TRANSFER. 
The main applications of the facts of transfer are 
related to: 
1. The need of specific training in each type of ability. 
2. The use of general methods for securing economy in 
learning. 
_ 8. The selection of subject matter. 
4. Theneed of broad training. 
| The Need of Specific Training.—The first fact, that 
each type of ability includes techniques and devices that 
are specific, is illustrated by reading. It has been shown 
that reading is not a single ability acquired once and for 
all by some one type of training but embraces many types 
of abilities each in certain respects different from others. 
To give a few examples: we may read unselectively, giv- 
   
-P-A-G-E-478
460 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
ing all words or ideas equal weight, or to single out the 
main ideas, to perceive the outline, the topic sentence or 
the key word, to answer a particular question, such as 
“Why,” “When” or “How.” We may read with passing 
interest only, for temporary or more permanent reten- 
tion. We may read every word, or “skim” rapidly, or 
change pace; we may reread to pick up the thread of a 
story, to detect parts overlooked, to verify an outline or 
to observe misspellings. There are other types of read- 
ing and it is now recognized that learning one is not learn- 
ing others. Competent teachers, having selected the 
type of reading reactions that are deemed worthy of 
acquisition, set up specific practice for each type. To be 
sure, there is usually transfer but in the main it is not 
great enough to depend on wholly. Each type of reading 
embraces little devices that are peculiar to it; no one type 
is exactly another. 
What is true of reading is true of observation, memo- 
rizing, reasoning, indeed, of mental activity of any type in 
any field. No ability comes wholly fortuitously. How- 
ever great general ability, however rich general experi- 
ence, in each function there are many elements that can 
be acquired only by specific adaptation. -—Even to each 
new pair of shoes, new automobile, or acquaintance 
specific adjustments are required, however great past ex- 
perience may have been with other shoes, automobiles, 
or acquaintances. 
The General Methods of Learning.—The more subtle 
devices and attitudes, just considered, are not easily 
transferred by deliberate intent. Contrasted with these 
obscure techniques of learning, many of the general meth- 
ods mentioned in the preceding chapters may be more 
generally applicable. Indeed, aside from well directed 
and controlled specific practice the most promising pos-
-P-A-G-E-479
  MENTAL ORGANIZATION 461 
sibility of improving mental efficiency is to be found in 
the use of general methods. To distribute reviews prop- 
erly, to use the whole method, to work intensively for 
the purpose of improving, to avoid “crutches,” etc., are 
devices that may be widely utilized. Other methods 
equally important such as keeping alert for errors, being 
analytic, or being systematic in reasoning are not so 
readily transferred. It usually requires a good deal of 
practice to acquire such habits of work in one field and 
on turning to another, a period of adaptation will almost 
always be needed. It will, in short, be a mistake to 
assume that memorizing a group of rules concerning eco- 
nomical methods of learning will be enough to increase 
one’s efficiency in all fields of learning. Indeed, it will be 
a mistake to assume that mastery of the good methods in 
any one type of learning will insure their operation in 
others. The methods must be put to work; they must 
be actively habituated to be of service. 
The Choice of Subject Matter.—For two reasons we 
may expect a greater transfer to the activities of daily 
life from subject matter which is itself directly useful in 
situations commonly encountered outside of school or 
college. First, in order to deal with the situations in life, 
as we saw in the preceding chapter, we need to know the 
facts involved. We cannot solve problems without in- 
formation any more than we can play a violin or operate 
a typewriter without the specific skills, no matter how 
intelligent or reasonable we may be.. Second, the trans- 
fer of methods of attack, interest, poise, devices of learn- 
ing or reasoning, habits or ideals of accuracy, thorough- 
ness, or initiative to the situations in life will be great to 
the degree that the subject matter of the classroom is 
identical with that used in the situations which life itself 
offers. We should, then, other things being equal, prefer 
 
-P-A-G-E-480
  462 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
genuine life issues and widely usable facts to unreal and 
fantastic problems or trivial, unusual or academic facts. 
There remains the possibility that certain subjects 
whose content as such is not widely used in life neverthe- 
less deserve consideration because the kind of activities 
demanded offer exceptionally effective opportunities for 
training and disciplining mind and character. Thus it 
might be urged that football offers exceptional opportuni- 
ties for the development of courage and sportsmanship, 
that geometry by the rigidity of its proofs leads to better 
habits of thought, that Latin because of its difficulty 
schools concentration and persistence. In each case of 
this type we must be sure that the subject does train 
even specifically the habits alleged; we must also ascer- 
tain possible outcomes, such as distaste for scholastic 
work, which may also be developed. 
The implication of such investigations as have been 
made is that no one subject, because of the intrinsic 
character of its organization, has outstanding merit in 
disciplinary or formal training. The sort of training de- 
rived depends greatly on the way it is taught or learned. 
Almost any subject may have some general value and 
give any or every sort of mental training in some degree. 
Mathematics may become a mere exercise in rote mem- 
ory, distasteful and largely futile, or it may become an 
absorbing study activating the finest features of reason- 
ing and imagination. What training will be secured can- 
not be foretold wholly from the name or content of the 
subject. Much depends on what reactions are exercised ; 
but, given equally good specific training, the amount of 
transfer will be great in proportion as the subject matter 
itself is utilized in life. 
The Need of Broad Training.—The mind and char- 
acter may best be trained in useful fields in life itsel:
-P-A-G-E-481
  \ GQHENTAL ORGANIZATION 463 
rather than in some narrow subject, occupation or project. 
When men declare that they developed will power by hoe- 
ing potatoes when they hated it, developed originality 
by solving puzzles in childhood, developed reasoning by 
studying mathematics, developed cooperativeness and 
courage on the football field, we may feel assured that 
they are in error, or at least, unusual. Any such experi- 
ence may have contributed its bit, great or small, but 
in so far as such traits are general characteristics of a 
an, and are acquired rather than inherited, they are due 
o training in many phases of life. General development 
is broad development.

Attention, Etc., Refer to Groups of Facts.—The im- 
lications of the facts of transfer are clearly in, opposition 
o the theory that the mind as a whole or that attention, 
emory and other operations are general powers or facul- 
ies. These words, we have said, are used merely as 
erms under which to explain a group of more or less 
losely related facts concerning human behavior. The 
acts described under these terms are aspects of the total 
ctivity of the organism. You-may remember that in the 
rst chapter it was stated that each science aims to 
iscover and to classify its facts. These terms, attention, 
te., ane names applied to classes of facts. Let us illus- 
rate concretely. 
All the Operations Engaged in Ordinary Reactions.— 
uppose you pick up a newspaper and read a joke. What 
s involved? Attention, to begin with. Under atten- 
ion are grouped such facts as the adjustment of the 
ense organs and the body generally, and the resulting 
igorous conscious reaction. Perception comes in too, 
f course—we perceive the words and the facts which the 
 
-P-A-G-E-482
    464 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
words represent. Is memory involved? Certainly. You 
may say that you remember the meaning of the words 
and that you remember facts related to these meanings. 
Is reasoning introduced? It may be, especially if the 
point of the joke is a little obscure. You must recall 
pertinent facts and react to them together with the facts 
presented in the joke to see the point. In the relatively 
simple act of reading a joke, then, all the processes may 
be found. These processes are not independent powers 
but aspects—indeed, somewhat overlapping aspects—of 
an ordinary mental operation. Test other tasks,—pitch- 
ing in baseball or memorizing a poem—and you will find 
a attention, perception, memory, are present and that 
soning or imagination are or may be engaged.) 
The Choice of Terms.—Since the several mental proc- 
esses are but terms used for convenience in referring to 
groups of related facts concerning mental operations, dif- 
ferent writers may use different words and more or less 
different types of classification. Many books on psychol- 
ogy use considerably such terms as discrimination, 
apperception, cognition, will, volition. To use these 
words in this book would mean not the addition of treat- 
ments of new processes or mental operations—certainly 
not the addition of new mental powers—but merely 
rearrangement of the facts presented. We resort to the 
classification of facts concerning human action unde! 
terms that seem to us suitable chiefly because it is utter] 
impossible to describe all the facts by a phrase or even 
chapter. The use of classification terms assists presenta- 
tion and recall. In so doing we run the risk of giving th 
impression that the terms refer not to groups of fact 
but to separate entities, forces or faculties. 
The Term Mind.—The term mind, like éne of the le 
inclusive terms, is equally subject to errofieous concep-      
      
    
    
   
-P-A-G-E-483
    tbe

tion. The mind, as psychology uses the term, is not a 
power or force, which may, for example, be contrasted 
with the’ body, which may influence and be influenced 
by the body, or which may be trained as a muscle is 
trained. Mind, like memory or will, is a pure abstraction; 
a word under which all of the facts concerning the inter- 
grated and conscious activities of the organism are 
grouped. When we think of mind, moreover, we think 
of conscious processes, of sensations, percepts, images, 
emotions. And this is quite proper since such conscious 
processes form an integral part of the whole activity 
of the human organism. The term, mind, refers to these 
activities; not to something above, or apart from them. 
Nature of Conscious Processes.—Strictly speaking, 
the conscious processes are themselves not independent 
entities. In ordinary life, we never really experience sen- 
sations all alone, apart from percepts of facts, images or 
recalled facts, feelings or emotions. Each sensation is 
fused with other processes to constitute a percept; each 
sensation is likely to be accompanied by a feeling, and to 
be a part of an emotion. The percept embraces sensa- 
tions with images and other recalled processes, not all 
of which are as yet well described or defined, and is usu- 
ally accompanied by feelings and impulses and sometimes 
by emotions. Feelings never exist by themselves. And 
so with the other processes,—they cannot be conceived 
as existing or functioning wholly alone. They are all but 
phases of the general conscious activity of the organism. 
They may be described more or less adequately in isola- 
tion but they do not function independently. At any 
one moment most of the processes are found in conscious- 
ness. When we have told all that is known about them, 
about their appearance in introspection, about their rela- 
tions to each other, about their modes of action and their 
 
-P-A-G-E-484
466 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
functions, in life generally, we have done all that we can 
to describe the mind scientifically. 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. Criticise the following problems in arithmetic for use in schools 
in the light of facts presented in this chapter: 
Alice has 3/10 of a dollar, Mary 11/16, Kate 2/19 and Nan 
9/14. How much have they together? 
Suppose a pie to be exactly round and 1014 miles in diameter. 
If it were cut into 6 equal pieces, how long would the curved 
edge of each piece be? 
A nail 5 inches long is driven through a board so that it 
projects 2.419 inches on one side and 1.726 on the other. How 
thick is the board? 
2. “Skim” the contents of the three preceding chapters and pick 
out the sections which have a definite relation to transfer. 
3. If one should speak English until 10 years old, then speak only 
German for 10 years, would the ability to speak English decrease 
more or less during the second ten years than if one had not 
spoken at all, i.e., been dumb during the second ten years? 
4, A woman aged 30 and her daughter aged 6 came to the United 
States from France. Why, after two years of practice, does the 
daughter speak more perfect English (meaning here merely 
accuracy of articulation) than the mother? If both had secured 
the same training during the two years, which would probably 
have developed the larger English vocabulary (knowledge of 
meaning of words)? Explain. 
5. William James, in his chapter on Habit, wrote: “As a final 
practical maxim, relative to these habits of will, we may, then, 
offer something like this: Keep the faculty of effort alive in 
you by a little gratuitous exercise every day. That is, be sys- 
tematically ascetic and heroic in little unnecessary points, do 
every day or two something for no other reason than that you 
would rather not do it, and so, when the hour of dire need 
draws nigh, it may find you not unnerved and untrained to 
stand the test.” Examine this statement critically and deter- 
mine what the conditions would have to be for it to agree with 
the doctrine given in the text. 
6. Would the Law of Effect have any bearing on James’s state- 
ment? Would the implication of that statement be that sub-
-P-A-G-E-485
Y¥os? 
MENTAL ORGANIZATION ‘462 ! 
jects should be introduced into the curriculum just because they 
are difficult or distasteful? 
7. Compare the implication of James’s statement with the follow- 
ing by Thorndike: ‘To study the distasteful that is known to 
be useful is of much greater disciplinary value than to study 
the merely distasteful. The habit of value is to suffer that good 
may come, not to suffer wastefully. It is in sacrificing for a 
greater good, not in mere sacrificing, that the mind gains, To 
suffer simply so as to stand suffering would be as foolish as to 
learn falsehoods so as to be able to unlearn them,” 
8. How do you suppose Thorndike would justify this statement: 
“The greatest disciplinary value of Latin would appear. in the 
case, not of those who disliked it and found it hard, but of 
those to whom it was a charming game”? 
9. Collect some statements from books on education, general read- 
ing, or advertisements which are based on erroneous notions of 
transfer. 
10. Suppose it were found in a certain secondary school that the 
students who had studied geometry were better in reasoning 
in general than those who had not. Would you consider this 
satisfactory evidence that training in geometry was responsible 
for the greater ability in general? 
11. Do you think some teachers secure a greater amount of transfer 
among their pupils than others do? How? 
12. Show in detail how the training received in (a) athletic games, 
(b) grammar, and (c) psychology may be made to function in 
everyday life. 
13. What reactions acquired in playing the piano would transfer 
to typewriting? To singing? What negative transfer might 
take place? 
14. On the basis of the general value of studies, what changes would 
you recommend in the curriculum of the high school from which 
you graduated? 
15. Will reading good literature contribute to your ability to write? 
To get the greatest transfer just how should you read? 
16. How would you train a child to meet emergencies (as in cases 
of fire, accidents, drowning, etc.)? To ‘what degree will mere 
knowledge of what to do function in face of an emergency? 
17. What subjects are especially useful to develop general open- 
mindedness or freedom from prejudice and superstition?

THE INFLUENCE OF INTERNAL AND 
EXTERNAL CONDITIONS UPON EFFICIENCY.    
   
    
        
        
    
   
        
    
     Nearly everyone has a number of convictions concern- 
ing the influences of various conditions such as fatigue, 
interest, the weather, time of day, noise, coffee and 
tobacco upon behavior. Long the subject of speculation 
and opinion, many of these conditions have been sub- 
jected within recent years to experimental study. 
Any factor, noise or alcohol, may be examined in its 
relations to several phases of behavior such as bodily 
comfort, particular internal sensations, moods, desires, 
lambitiousness, nervousness, speed and efficiency in learn- 
ing or performing as well as in its relations to general 
ealth, vigor or happiness. In the discussions which fol- 
low, we shall be limited mainly to the influence of sev- 
eral factors upon efficiency in performance or learning 
during the time the factor is active. We shall be con- 
cerned, then, primarily with the immediate effects of the 
onditions imposed on efficiency of some type. 
- Tae Inriupnce or Motivation. 
Motivation during Short Periods.—The potency of 
ertain motives in influencing achievement is first in im- 
ortance and magnitude. It is illustrated in pronounced 
orm by an experiment upon college students (Knight 
nd Remmers). Ten college Freshmen, after being sub- 
jected for five days to severe humiliation, hard work, loss 
469 
 
-P-A-G-E-488
  470 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
of sleep, hazing and general torment, were given, late at 
night, a series of tests in computation, the results of 
which the Freshmen were convinced, would have consid- 
erable weight in deciding their fitness for admission to a 
college fraternity. The motivating factor was their de- 
sire to qualify for membership. A series of five-minute 
tests were given with but short intervals between. The 
results of these tests were compared with those obtained 
from fifty college Juniors whose work was not motivated 
in any special way. As regards intelligence, age and 
arithmetic ability, it may be assumed that the Juniors| 
were at least as good as the Freshman; as regards physi- 
cal fitness they certainly possessed a striking advantage. 
The Juniors, however, during the seven five-minute pe-| 
riods averaged 9.6 problems correctly solved per period, 
whereas the tired Freshman during their first seven tests 
averaged 18.3 problems per period, or twice as many. 
Since in every other respect the Juniors had the advan- 
tage, the‘differences in achievement must be credited ks 
the factor of motivation. 
Motivation over Longer Periods.—That the influ 
ence of motivation is not necessarily limited to a tem- 
porary spurt, and that it results in stable improvemen 
when so utilized as to affect practice has been disclose 
by several studies. In one of these (Kitson) the dail: 
output of forty hand compositors in a Chicago printin 
establishment was followed for a year during which moti. 
vation was provided by giving a cash bonus for increase 
productivity and by the recording and display of evidence 
of improvement. These men were mainly experience 
workers with periods of service in the trade from 2 to 2’ 
years, and an average of 10.3 years. Many had bee 
working on a dead level of efficiency for years. Unde 
the influence of the incentives, the men, young and old,

began to improve. After five months their output was 
67 per cent greater. Since these men were more experi- 
enced and therefore presumably more fixed in their 
habits, they improved less on the whole than the less 
experienced men. There were some striking exceptions, 
however. One man for example who had been in the 
trade for 27 years increased his output 142 per cent.

the writing of as many legible “a’s” as possible during a 30 second 
period. During the first ten practice periods, the group thus mo- 
tivated made greater improvement than the group which did not 
learn the results of its work—the unmotivated group. From the 
tenth day, the motivation was reversed. The first group, now not 
permitted to see their progress, begin at once to lose, whereas the 
other group, on studying their scores, progress rapidly. (Modified 
from W. F. Book, Pedagogical Seminary, Dec., 1922.) 
Varieties of Motives.—The varieties of motives are 
umerous. The most potent motives have their roots 
n the dominant human urges described in Chapter IX.

sample of the experimental findings in which knowl-

    472 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
edge of results serves as a motive is shown in Figure 51. 
In this instance the learners aware of their progress from 
day to day are stimulated to greater achievements, and 
when the incentive is removed efficiency deteriorates at 
once. Rivalry produced by the sight and sound of others 
working and especially by the awareness of the achieve- 
ments and gains made by others as well as by one’s self is 
an effective form of urge to improve. Several investi- 
gators have found that children work better and faster 
and improve more rapidly when working together under 
the spur of competition than when working alone. The 
circumstances surrounding a “test” in the classroom or 
the psychological laboratory usually spur the subject 
to greater effort than under ordinary circumstances, The 
presence of the experimenter looking on and the presence 
of other subjects taking the test at the same time seem 
to produce greater effort than is secured when the subject 
works alone. 
In these studies the potency of motivation resulting 
from influences affecting the subject during a period of 
work is very pronounced. Obviously one may work at 
various levels below the maximum. The level presum- 
ably depends upon the effort which in turn varies with 
the type of motivation. These facts complicate the task 
of ascertaining the effects of other factors such as coffee 
or noise upon performance. Provisions must be made to 
isolate the physiological effects of coffee upon efficiency 
from the effects of other conditions surrounding the test 
which act merely as spurs to effort. Before leaving the 
topic of motivation it will be desirable to see under what 
conditions maximum effort may be secured; whether it is 
a stable or unstable condition and whether certain types 
of motivation may be so powerful as to disturb and reduce 
achievement rather than increase it.

THE INFLUENCE OF CONDITIONS 473 
The Influence of Complimentary and Disparaging 
Remarks.—Complimentary and disparaging remarks 
addressed to a performer or learner by another, as for 
example, by an experimenter, may act as an incentive to 
greater effort. Like any other form of motivation they 
may cause a subject to try to do his best, or when applied 
to a person already trying hard they may stimulate him 
to extraordinary effort which may conceivably hav , either 
a beneficial or disturbing effect on efficiency. To ascer- 
tain the specific effects of the remarks it is necessary 
somehow to render constant the influence of other mo- 
tives, that is, to insure equal effort in the series of tests 
required as well as to take care of the influence of im- 
provement due to practice. This was done in a.study 
with college women as subjects (G. S. Gates and Riss- 
land). The women were at first tested individually in 
speed of naming a series of colors and in speed of tapping 
with a pencil-like stylus under conditions that usually 
secure great effort. Following each test of each woman 
in the case of one-third of the number, such disparaging 
remarks were made as these: “Oh dear, this is really a 
very poor score. I am afraid that you are at the bottom 
of the group, ete.” Following each test of another third, 
complimentary remarks were offered such as “That is 
really splendid! Your score is way up at the top of the 
group.” To another third—the control group—no re- 
marks were made. Every woman, following the ssieiahes 
was asked to take the tests again, those who were dis- 
paraged presumably to improve a poor showing, those 
complimented to further increase their score, those of the 
control group for no stated purpose. By comparing the 
differences between the results of the first and second 
tests of the two motivated groups with those of the con- 
trol, the specific effects of the remarks are disclosed. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-492
  474 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
general, it appeared that either type of remark produced 
improvement as compared to no remark at all but the 
gains were small. In exceptional cases, and these mainly 
among poor rather than among good performers, the in- 
fluence of disparagement was unfavorable. In the main, 
however, the motivation produced by the presence of the

experimenter and the general setting of the experiment 
was but little changed by such remarks as were made. 
The Influence of Observers.—The mere presence of an 
investigator and the general experimental setting is ap- 
parently a decidedly potent incentive. Whether the addi- 
tion of other observers, or of a considerable audience, 
would provide a more effective motive or result in a 
decrease in achievement, was the subject of another study. 
College women were the subjects; several tests of mental 
and motor functions were used. Each subject was first 
tested by the experimenter alone, then in the case of 
twenty-five women the test was repeated in the presence 
of the experimenter alone; each of another twenty-five 
took the second test before a group of four to six observ-  
-P-A-G-E-493
THE INFLUENCE OF CONDITIONS 475 
ers, and each of a third twenty-five took her second test 
before an audience of from twenty-seven to thirty-seven 
observers. The members of the audience observed atten- 
tively but made no remarks. The presence of the 
audience resulted in no constant increase or decrease in 
comparison with the achievements of those taking the 
second test in the presence of the experimenter alone, as 
shown in the table on page 474. The differences vary 
from test to test and on the whole they appear to be due 
to chance factors rather than a consistent effect of the 
‘number of observers. 
| Motivation in Experimental Settings——In all of the 
studies of motivation, individual differences are found. 
Some persons appear to require little special motivation 
to put forth their best efforts; others require considerable. 
Some are relatively little influenced by conditions that 
act powerfully on others. Some are very stable in per- 
formance under extreme effort ; others may by trying too 
hard become confused and show a decrement in achieve- 
ment or break down entirely. Some are disturbed by 
factors which merely stimulate others to the optimum 
degree. The studies of motivation -indicate that in in- 
vestigations of the influence of other factors, alcohol or 
fatigue, the experimental situation should include a strong 
but not excessively stirring form of motivation, in order 
to keep the workers at maximum effort without running 
the risk of overstimulation. These conditions are very 
well fulfilled by the presence of a competent experi- 
menter, the general laboratory situation, and a certain 
amount of encouragement of the subject to do his best. 
Adding to these factors another experimenter or assist- 
ant, or fellow workers in the tests, seems to matter but 
slightly in most instances. This, at least, seems to be 
true of college students. Probably their stability is due 
we
-P-A-G-E-494
  476 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
to the fact that they are well disciplined in test situations, 
in doing mental and motor tasks in the presence of an 
instructor, with and before groups, and to experience in 
controlling themselves in the face of praise and reproof 
and the usual distractions of a classroom or laboratory. 
It is entirely probable that children or individuals picked 
at random from the community would be more profoundly 
affected both favorably and unfavorably by variations in 
the motivating conditions. Because of their stability of 
performance under moderate motivation, college students 
are especially good subjects for investigations of the 
effects of other factors, to which we shall now turn. 
Tue INFLUENCE or ExTeRNAL ConpiTIONS. 
The Influence of “Bad Air.”—It is popularly believed 
that in poorly ventilated rooms, carbon-dioxide and other 
toxins from expired air result in drowsiness, lassitude, 
headaches, and loss of efficiency. Pure air contains about 
21 per cent of oxygen, 78 per cent of nitrogen, and 0.03 
per cent of carbon-dioxide. In a very crowded and ill- 
ventilated school room the carbon-dioxide may be in- 
creased to 0.3 per cent and the oxygen decreased to 19 
per cent, but these changes are insufficient to produce the 
effects ordinarily observed. When the air is cool, of fav- 
orable humidity, and in movement, the oxygen content 
must be reduced to 2.4 per cent before ill effects are 
produced. When the air is hot and of unfavorable humid- 
ity, the ill effects are not relieved by breathing pure air 
through a tube from the outside. High temperature or 
humidity or both, then, rather than low oxygen content 
and expired matter, seem to be the causes of discomfort. 
Temperature and Humidity.—The influence of stale 
air, high and low temperature and humidity in various 
combinations has been studied by Thorndike and several

psychologists working under the auspices of the New York 
State Commission on Ventilation. 
It was found that adult subjects when urged to do their 
best could perform quite well and improved in efficiency 
quite as much when working in hot, humid, stale, and 
stagnant air (temperature 86° Fahrenheit, humidity 80 
per cent, with no fresh air and no movement in the air) 
as when they were working under “optimum” conditions 
—namely, a temperature of 68° Fahrenheit, 50 per cent 
relative humidity and 45 cubic feet of outside air per 
minute for each person. It was furthermore found that 
when the subjects were given very uninteresting work 
and were given no special incentives to do well, they still 
did as much and as well when working eight hours a day 
in the hot, humid, and stale air as when working under 
optimum conditions. Finally, when individuals were 
given their choice of doing mental work, reading stories, 
resting, talking or sleeping, they did quite as much work 
when the temperature was 75° as when it was milder, 
68° Fahrenheit. d 
The influence of extremely low humidity, with tem- 
perature kept constant at 75° Fahrenheit, was found to 
have no perceptible effects upon efficiency or improva- 
bility. A squad practicing arithmetic, typewriting, and 
other functions during the regular working day, and under 
ordinary motivation, with the humidity reduced to 20 
per cent, improved as rapidly as a squad working under 
the “ideal” degree of humidity, 50 per cent (Stecher). 
_ The atmospheric conditions which are encountered in 
ordinary life, then, however uncomfortable some of them 
may be, have no appreciable effect upon efficiency in per- 
formance, or on improvement in mental and light motor 
work when moderate motivation is present. Whether 
long continued exposure to very hot, very moist, or dry

air would occasion a good deal of wear and tear on the 
body or injure health, is another problem not as yet 
solved. The results of the psychological investigations 
‘indicate merely that if severe atmospheric conditions, as 
in mid-summer, must be faced one may as well be cheer- 
ful. At least, it is unlikely to be too hot to make mental 
work unprofitable. It is possible to learn as well when 
it is hot as when it is cool, when it is moist or dry, or when 
the humidity is moderate. 
The experimental studies have a bearing on the peren- 
nial topic of the effects of weather and climate upon 
human feelings and efficiency. That human beings do 
become adapted rapidly to the most forbidding climatic 
conditions of the globe is not surprising in the light of 
experimental studies in which adjustments are effectively 
made to abrupt and extreme changes in humidity, tem- 
perature, and staleness. While climate and weather in- 
cludes in addition to these factors others such as density 
of the atmosphere, light and possibly electrical conditions, 
the probability is that adaptation to these is equally 
facile. : 
Illumination and Color.—The most essential feature of 
favorable illumination is an evenness of distribution of 
light, especially the absence of glare or contrast in the 
field of view. Artificial or window light should therefore 
come from above, behind, or at the sides. Contrasts in 
walls and hangings, glistening paper, or polished instru- 
ments contribute to eye fatigue. A second desirable fea- 
ture is illumination of moderate intensity. Lights are 
more often too bright than too dim. Particularly un- 
favorable intensities and brightnesses are often produced 
by the use of high power electric lights. A soft even light 
from indirect or semi-direct systems is most satisfactory. 
There are many opinions concerning the effects of  
-P-A-G-E-497
  THE INFLUENCE OF CONDITIONS 479 
colors of lights or surroundings on efficiency, disposition 
and health, but the findings of experimental investiga- 
tions have been mainly negative. The most significant 
difference between light from an uncolored globe and 
light from a colored globe is that the colored light is less 
intense, since the colored glass absorbs some of the rays. 
It has been found (by Pressey) that the more intense 
light is more stimulating, but the difference is small. 
What little is gained by means of the stimulating effect 
of intense light is probably more than compensated for 
by its fatiguing effect upon the eyes. Colored glasses are 
restful only because they reduce light intensity. It makes 
little difference what particular color is used. 
Auditory Distractions.—Just as the organism becomes 
dapted to wide difference in light or temperature, so it 
comes adapted to persistent sounds of the street, con- 
ersation, rattling of typewriters, or the roar of ma- 
hinery. When adults are well adapted to a working 
ondition, new distractions are apparently at. first dis- 
urbing, although they have little effect on the output. 
xperiments conducted in the laboratory (by Morgan) 
ndicate that when a subject is well adapted to a working 
ondition, the introduction of a new disturbance causes 
ut a slight and temporary decrease in efficiency, although 
t may be decidedly annoying. The subject soon arouses 
imself to overcome or adjust to the noise. His output is 
hen kept up to the norm, often actually surpassing it, 
ut in so doing more than ordinary energy is consumed. 
e may pound the typewriter keys harder, grit his 
eeth,. articulate, and contract various muscles. These 
superfluous activities drop out gradually as adjustment is 
erfected, just as irrelevant reactions tend to be elim- 
ated in all forms of trial-and-error learning. The gen- — 
ral. rule seems to be that when a new disturbance is —

encountered, the worker sets about to acquire by trial 
and error an adaptive reaction to it and often succeeds 
in so doing without appreciable deterioration of his out- 
put during the process. 
The Influence of the Time of Day.—Under the condi- 
tions of an ordinary day, what is the relative efficiency in 
mental and motor performances at different hours? In 
one investigation, the pupils of several grades were re- 
peatedly tested in representative tasks at different periods 
until the accumulated results gave a fairly accurate meas- 
ure of achievements resulting from maximum effort at 
different hours of the day. The results are given in the 
table below.

and completion, efficiency is lowest in the first and high- 
est in the last morning period. A slight drop follows the 
lunch ‘period with a subsequent rise between two and 
three o’clock. Other investigations have shown a very 
similar distribution of efficiency for gross bodily func- 
tions, such as shoveling and lifting. Efficiency in motor 
skills, such as cancellation and tracing, is somewhat 
greater in the afternoon than in the forenoon. 
Similar average results were obtained from a group of 
college students tested at all hours, except noon, from 
eight A.M. to five P.M. An interesting feature of this 
investigation was the disagreement between the distribu- 
tion of actual ability and the distribution of self-judged 
ability. Most students were quite mistaken about the 
hours of their maximum efficiency, doubtless because they 
were misled by feelings of fatigue which were often most 
acute at the periods of highest efficiency. 
_ One thing is quite certain: the ordinary work of the 
eo day is not so severe as to reduce efficiency per- 
eptibly. In fact, achievement is higher at nearly every 
our than it is at the beginning of the day. In the main, 
he differences are small. Aside from the suggestion that 
uch functions as writing, drawing, or other light work 
equiring speed and accuracy of movement might well be 
one in the early afternoon period, it would appear to 
ake little difference at what hours mental work is 
ursued.    
    
      
   
      
    Tue InruuENcEe or Continuous Work. 
Continuous Muscular Work.—The effect of continuous 
ork in a function upon efficiency in it, as measured by 
he amount and quality of the product (words written, 
acts learned, ete.), varies considerably with the function. 
In the case of hard muscular work the decline in. effi-

ciency is rather steady and pronounced. Figure 52 shows 
the relative distances through which the middle finger 
pulls a load of about six and a half pounds making a pul 
every two seconds. The muscle soon is incapable o: 
lifting the load although it is not entirely exhausted a:

shown by the fact that it can still lift smaller weights 
A rest of about two hours would be required before the 
muscle could repeat the original performance. If suffi 
cient rest is given between the contractions, the musel 
will lift the load a much greater number of times. If « 
muscle in some other part of the body, the other arm, fo: 
example, is working at the same time, the finger loses it:

   THE INFLUENCE OF CONDITIONS 483 
trength more rapidly possibly because of the fatigue 
roducts circulating in the blood. Loss of sleep or food, 
land doses of alcohol and certain other drugs, decrease the 
efficiency of the muscle, whereas sugar, adrenalin, and 
certain other chemicals increase efficiency. 
Muscular work of this sort uses up definite materials 
uch as glycogen and develops by-products such as carbon 
dioxide, which together reduce the capacity to function. 
Unpleasant sensations, pain, or so-called “feelings of 
fatigue” are also produced, along with definite impul- 
ions to cease the work. 
Continuous Work of the Neurones.—The effect of 
ontinuous work by isolated neurones may be observed 
xperimentally. One method employed is to dissect from 
freshly killed frog a large muscle with a long motor 
erve attached. Such a “nerve muscle preparation” can 
e kept alive for a long time. If the stump of the nerve 
s stimulated by an electric shock, the nervous impulse 
hus occasioned discharges into the muscle and causes a 
ontraction. If contractions are provoked rapidly, the 
uscle soon fails to respond. Whether the loss of 
apacity is due to fatigue of the nerve or to fatigue of 
he muscle may be determined by an experiment. If a 
it of the drug curari is placed on the nerve near the 
uscle, the nerve impulse is blocked at that point so that 
t fails to activate the muscle. It has been found, how- 
ver, that the impulse passes along the nerve as far as 
he point at which the drug is applied, 7.e., that the neu- 
ones are conducting as under ordinary circumstances. 
nvestigators have found that even when the nerve is 
timulated several times per second for ten hours or more, 
emoval of the effects of curari results in the renewal of 
he muscular contractions upon stimulation of the nerve 
hus demonstrating an extraordinary resistance to

“fatigue” on the part of nerves as compared to the 
muscles. 
Continuous Mental Work.—Mental work usually in- 
volves the activity of muscles as well as neurones of the 
central nervous system. In reading, the muscles of the 
eyes, at least, are engaged; in writing compositions and! 
in arithmetic, the muscles of the eyes, hands, and arms

are active. Even in “mental” arithmetic, spelling, o 
ordinary thinking, muscles of the eyes, the vocal organs 
and probably other parts of the body are involved to som 
extent. And in all types of mental work, the maintenane 
of the body’s position depends upon muscular adjust 
ments. Thus, what we call “mental fatigue” is in par 
the result of muscular work and identical with muscula: 
fatigue. 
When one has been working continuously at spelling:
-P-A-G-E-503
THE INFLUENCE OF CONDITIONS 485 
arithmetic, reading, composition, or some other mental 
task, he may become aware of a group of sensations which 
technically have been called “feelings of fatigue,” usually 
unpleasant in character. Feelings of fatigue are, in a 
large measure, sensations from muscles, tendons, and 
joints, and include feeling of numbness, aches, and pains 
from the eyes, head, back, and other parts of the body. 
With these are fused other sensations derived from vis- 
ceral, arterial, and other organic conditions. The whole 
constitutes the familiar feeling of fatigue which is usually 
accompanied by impulses to stop working. If the work 
is continued it becomes tedious or distasteful. 
The progressive course of feelings of fatigue and an- 
noyance produced by continued work is pictured roughly 
in Figure 53, which is based upon the judgments of a 
group of adults obtained during four hours of continuous 
work in grading English composition. Highly interesting 
at the beginning, the work became progressively less 
pleasant, until at the end of the fourth hour it was clearly 
distasteful. 
Feelings of fatigue and loss of interest are commonly 
ecepted by workers as indicative, at least approximately, 
f a decreased state of efficiency. But that these symp- 
oms are extremely misleading has been found repeatedly 
hen the quantity and quality of the output has been 
easured during periods of continuous work. In Figure 
3, the distastefulness of the work in the case of grading 
ompositions, for four hours continuously, is plotted to- 
ether with the output. The loss of ability is not nearly 
s great as the loss of satisfaction in the work. 
Many investigations of continuous mental work have 
ielded similar results. Two or three hours of continuous 
ork at maximum effort produces a temporary decrease 
n the product of not over 10 per cent, and in most fune-  
-P-A-G-E-504
486 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
tions less than that. By a temporary decrease is meant 
one which is curable by a rest of an hour or less. Of 
course, the curve of work is marked by all sorts of 
fluctuations, some of them peculiar to particular indi- 
viduals, and efficiency may drop more decidedly if the 
worker eases up. But on the whole, continuous work in 
mental functions shows a small loss in output as com- 
pared to that found in continuous muscular work. If we 
make mental work as difficult as we can, taking for om 
task the mental multiplication of such numbers as 837% 
and 3458, for example, we find that, as demonstrated by 
one experimenter (Arai), it is possible to keep it up fot 
12 hours at a stretch. The result of long continued diffi- 
cult mental work is thus in sharp contrast to the effect o! 
hard physical work. While feelings of physical fatigue 
may be fair indices of physical capacity, they yield by n« 
means reliable evidence of mental efficiency. 
So far as mere loss of efficiency is concerned, there i 
little to urge against long continued work of the sam 
sort. But what of other effects? Too lengthy applicatior 
to a task may make the work uninteresting or positively 
repugnant. When the work becomes distasteful or ex 
asperating, it probably indicates an unfavorable organi 
stirring-up somewhat similar to that observed under emo 
tional irritation or excitement. This general state i 
indicative of a considerable organic wear and tear whicl 
may become injurious if long continued. But it is th 
repugnance, exasperation, excitement, or worry produce¢ 
by mental work rather than the work itself which is harm 
ful. If one can school himself to maintain interest an 
enjoyment in the task, the ill-effects of long and har 
mental work may be tremendously reduced. There are 
of course, limits to the amount of mental work one ma; 
safely do because of the muscular fatigue and the depriva
-P-A-G-E-505
THE INFLUENCE OF CONDITIONS 487 
ions of recreations, exercise, rest, and sleep which too 
ersistent work may bring. Just how long a person may 
afely do mental work depends partly upon his general 
trength and stability, partly upon his susceptibility to 
excitement and worry, and partly upon his interest. 
The “feelings of fatigue” are in part, if not mainly, the 
results of muscular activity and strain. Much may be 
one to lessen unnecessary and often damaging fatigue, 
articularly of eye and hand. For example, the task of 
opying problems to be computed in arithmetic or alge- 
ra, facts to be learned, etc., is not only harder work, 
minute for minute, than computing or memorizing, but 
much more monotonous. It is, moreover, as unnecessary 
as it is fatiguing. Less worry about the disastrous effects 
of “mental fatigue’ and more attention to muscular 
fatigue of eyes, hands and the body is one suggestion 
which the experimental studies of mental work have to 
offer. 
General Conclusions.—Other types of experimental 
evidence on the remarkable capacity of the organism to 
adapt itself to unusual conditions have been obtained. 
For example, students during periods of from 30 to 48 
hours without sleep, although subject to pronounced 
‘feelings of fatigue” and other uncomfortable symptoms, 
were nevertheless able to perform mentally as efficiently 
and learn as effectively as under ordinary conditions 
(study by Robinson). During a fast of 31 days, a man 
(studied by Langfeld) showed no appreciable loss of 
mental efficiency and ability to learn, although the de- 
crease of bodily weight and strength was great. 
In the study mentioned above (Knight and Remmers) 
ome of the subjects during five days were given Hinkle’s 
ills, not permitted to shave or bathe, were forced to 
carry with them everywhere weighty articles, were 
   
-P-A-G-E-506
488 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
“paddled” with barrel-staves, forced to eat raw live’ 
(“ostensibly dog-meat’’), were subjected to realistic bu 
fake “brandings” and otherwise hazed, were allowed onl 
one or two hours of sleep in twenty-four, and during th 
twenty-two waking hours were required to do menial 
work about the house, or go “frequently” on hikes of 12 
to 15 miles, in addition to carrying on their regular uni- 
versity work. Despite all of these hardships, under strong 
motivation, they appeared to do simple mental work as 
well as usual. Such facts bear witness to the remarkable 
stability of the mechanisms involved in well habituated 
mental activities. It is surprising that these functions, 
which may be so readily allowed to operate below maxi- 
mum in the absence of incentives, remain unimpaired in 
efficiency, during and after such extreme deprivations and 
exertions. The facts attest, also, to the remarkably effec- 
tive and facile adaptability of the human organism to 
unfavorable conditions imposed upon it. 
Some of these adaptive reactions—to heat, cold, low 
humidity, continuous work, loss of food—appear to be 
’ directly instinctive; that is, they are carried out as in the 
case of the infant, by adjustments inborn rather than 
learned. The adaptations to new noises, or visual dis- 
tractions, while involving instinctive acts, are neverthe- 
less, in a genuine sense, acquired. The process of over- 
coming an auditory distraction affords, as we have said, 
a beautiful example of the trial-and-error learning in 
which elimination and selection continues until the ad- 
justment becomes easy, smooth, and nearly unnoticed 
That these adaptations are, however, really active ad- 
justments is indicated by the fact that when the stimulus 
to which an individual is adapted so completely that it i: 
unnoticed, is removed, he becomes aware of the change 
and must make another adjustment to the rearrangec

conditions. Thus, when one is adapted to a certain rattle 
or roar in his working environment, removal of the sound 
may be temporarily disturbing, although readjustment is 
shortly achieved. 
Tue INFLUENCE or Drues. 
Caffeine.—Caffeine is the active drug in tea, coffee, and 
many soda-fountain drinks. An average cup of hot black 
tea contains 1.5 grains; an after-dinner coffee about the 
same; an average glass of cold green tea about 2.0 grains; 
and a large cup of coffee about 2.5 grains. 
_ Employing a squad of 16 subjects whose food, sleep, 
rest, and work were controlled during an experiment 
which extended over 40 days, the influence of doses of 
caffeine ranging from two to six grains upon various men- 
tal and motor functions was measured (Hollingworth). 
Effort to work was insured by prizes, display of rewards, 
and other incentives. The effects of suggestion and an- 
ticipation were eliminated by administering the drug in 
disguise. At uniform intervals the subjects were given a 
mixture which sometimes contained and at other times 
did not contain the caffeine. 
The effect of a dose of caffeine appears usually within 
an hour and lasts for several hours, depending on the 
sizeof the dose. This substance usually produces a de- 
crease in muscular steadiness and tremors which appear 
more quickly and last longer with larger doses. In type- 
writing, greater accuracy results from using the drug, 
while speed is also increased except by large doses which 
reduce the rate of writing. In more purely mental work 
—naming the opposites of words, naming colors, adding, 
etc.—efficiency was increased by doses of all sizes for 
periods varying from three to seven hours. In the task 
of crossing out certain numbers from rows of mixed num- 
 
-P-A-G-E-508
  490 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
bers doses of four grains or more produced improvement 
in ability which sometimes persisted for nearly 24 hours. 
The stimulating effect of the drug was indicated by the 
fact that a dose of six grains disturbed the sleep of most 
subjects, and on some much smaller doses had a similar 
effect. The stimulating influences of caffeine, contrary 
to general opinion, is not followed by a subsequent period 
of depression, at least not within 72 hours. 
It should be understood that tea, coffee, and other 
caffeinic beverages contain other substances which may 
enhance or neutralize the effects of caffeine or produce 
still other effects, good or bad. What influence the long 
continued use of this drug may have on the body is not 
known, but during a period of 40 days, in so far as integ- 
rity and proficiency in mental work are concerned, caf- 
feine has distinctly an accelerating effect without any 
observable harmful results. 
Tobacco Smoking.—To determine the effects of to- 
bacco smoking upon efficiency or improvement during 
mental work is exceedingly difficult. Statistics gathered 
concerning groups of smokers and non-smokers are inter- 
esting but worthless since the groups may differ in many 
other habits as well as in the use of tobacco. If habitual 
smokers are used as subjects, the mere deprivation of the 
exercise of the habit may disturb their attitude toward 
work. If subjects unaccustomed to smoking are used, the 
effects of tobacco will not be typical of the effects on the 
average smoker. If we are interested in the effect of 
tobacco alone, it is essential that the subject should not 
know when he is really smoking tobacco and when he is 
not, since the mere idea of smoking, the pleasure (or 
displeasure in the case of the unhabituated) or the stim- 
ulation provided by the sight, taste and smell, may pro- 
duce the result rather than the drug itself.
-P-A-G-E-509
THE INFLUENCE OF CONDITIONS 491 
By means of an ingenious pipe, heated by an electric 
coil, it has apparently been possible to deceive the smoker 
(Hull). When blindfolded, the subjects were unable to 
tell whether they were really smoking tobacco or the 
slightly moistened warm air through the control pipe. 
Eighteen students, nine habitual and nine non-smokers, 
were tested in a number of functions on each of eighteen 
days. Each day the subject took the series of twelve

tests, and then began to smoke, on some days a pipe 
filled with real tobacco, on others the fake pipe. After 
beginning to smoke, the subject went through the series 
of tests three more times, with brief intervals between. 
The results of this study show that the influence of 
tobacco smoking is a rather variable matter. With some 
the immediate effects are detrimental but after an hour 
or so of continuous smoking they pass off, leaving the 
performance uninfluenced, or, rarely, slightly improved. 
With others the immediate effect may be beneficial while 
continued smoking brings on unfavorable effects. On 
the whole, the tobacco seemed to slow down and disturb 
the mental abilities tested slightly. The effects were 
little more pronounced in the case of the non-habitual 
smokers. No individual was always unfavorably influ-

enced in all of the tests, however; there was only a 
tendency for tobacco to exert a detrimental influence 
more frequently than a favorable influence. The average 
of results for all individuals during the nine smoking days 
for each function is shown in the accompanying table. 
The average result for all subjects in all tests was a 
loss of about 5 per cent. Tobacco smoke rather uniformly 
accelerated the heart beat and reduced steadiness of motor 
control; these were the most consistent and pronounced 
effects. 
Concerning the effects of tobacco on general health, 
ambitiousness, creative inspiration and the like, there are 
opinions in abundance, but no reliable data. 
Alcohol.—The influence of alcohol, administered in its 
pure form, diluted with water or beverages, upon effi- 
ciency in various mental and motor functions has been 
investigated on several occasions with results which agree 
in the main. An English psychologist, Rivers, was the 
first to disguise the alcohol property so that the subject 
was unable to tell by look, taste, or smell, whether the 
mixture contained alcohol or another harmless substance. 
This investigator employed tests mainly of muscular effi- 
ciency, strength, and endurance, upon which little effect 
was produced except by large doses of alcohol. Effects 
found in earlier investigations were attributed to sensory 
stimulation (tastes, odors, sting) or to expectation of 
improvement rather than to the drug itself. 
During extensive and carefully controlled investiga- 
tions in the Nutrition Laboratory of the Carnegie Insti- 
tute, it was found (Dodge and Benedict) that alcohol had 
not a stimulating but a depressing effect upon mental and 
motor efficiency. To this statement there was one excep- 
tion—the pulse was accelerated, which was symptomatic, 
perhaps, of internal resistance to the drug. In the case

of several functions, the losses of efficiency which resulted 
from doses of 30 and 45 cubic centimeters of aleohol— 
the results for doses of both sizes combined—were as 
follows: 
Knee-jerk: decrease in extent of muscle contraction....46 per cent

  Speed of eye movements: decreased...

  In all tests, the effect of alcohol is to reduce functional 
capacity, and this is strikingly true of the simple protec- 
tive reflex activities which become more sluggish in rate 
and less effective in extent. No tests of mental efficiency 
were employed by these workers.

The influence of alcohol on both motor and mental 
functions has been recently investigated (Hollingworth). 
The alcohol dosage was administered in the form of beer 
which was 2.75 per cent alcohol by weight. Six trials of 
each test were given during the forenoon. At noon the 
beer was given with a small amount of food. On certain
-P-A-G-E-512
ee ae 
494 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
days beer was given which was identical in all respects 
with the genuine except that the alcohol had been re- 
moved, thus providing a control. During the afternoon, 
six trials of each test were given again. In the accom- 
panying table, the gains and losses of efficiency due 
specifically to alcohol are given in terms of percentages. 
The loss of efficiency due to alcohol is universal and 
pronounced among the functions tested, with the excep- 
tion of the rise in pulse rate. Codrdination of motor con- 
trol and speed of tapping are appreciably reduced, steadi- 
ness is moré markedly disturbed. For all of these motor 
functions, the effect of the large dose is greater than that 
of the small. On mental efficiency, the drug has a similar 
disastrous effect, similarly proportionate to the size of 
the dose. 
The singular rise in pulse rate, which was also observed 
by Dodge and Benedict, and also by Hull during the use 
of tobacco, is probably a symptom of the arousal of 
internal mechanisms to combat the damaging effects of 
the drug. In support of this hypothesis was the finding | 
by Hollingworth, that those subjects whose mental and 
motor control were least influenced by the drug showed 
the greatest increase in pulse rate. 
Other Drugs.—Strychnine in fairly large doses (45 
to %s5 grains) seems to lead to a temporary increase in 
ability to run a complex machine (dotting machine) and 
in capacity to memorize, often followed by a decrease to 
Jess than normal capacity unless the ‘dose is repeated. 
Very small doses, %o to %o grain (according to Poffen- 
berger), produce negligible results on speed of tapping, 
aiming, and a wide variety of mental functions. Opium 
and morphine appear to cause an initial stimulation which 
appears slowly and rises to a maximum, and then effi- 
ciency descends below, sometimes considerably below,

normal. Cocaine causes a large immediate stimulation 
followed by a period of pronounced depression. Because 
of its immediately stimulating effects it has become a 
great favorite among drug addicts. 
CoNncLUSIONS. 
The experiments here given disclose only the imme- 
diate effects of external conditions, work and drugs. It 
would be unsafe-to conclude that influences showing 
great immediate effects upon mental efficiency and skill 
would have a corresponding serious effect upon general 
health or upon particular bodily functions and organs 
when used continuously. It would be likewise unsafe to 
conclude that influences whose immediate effects are 
slight or zero would produce, when continuously used, no 
general or specific ill results. To determine the outcome 
of the habitual use of drugs or of habitual exposure to 
unusual environmental conditions constitutes another 
and more difficult problem. Of no mean importance, 
however, is the finding that not unusual doses of alcohol, 
caffeine, strychnine, and other drugs disturb mental and 
motor efficiency at once and more profoundly than dep- 
rivations of food or sleep, or exposure to natural ex- 
tremes of atmospheric conditions, or to visual and audi- 
tory distractions, or continuous mental work. These 
substances richly deserve their name—“powerful drugs.” 
In the course of normal life, efficiency in mental work 
fluctuates not mainly because of the intrinsic effects of 
tea, wine, tobacco, fatigue, noise, or bodily conditions, 
but because of variations in motivation. The depressing 
effects of tobacco or moderate doses of alcohol are small 
ompared to decreases in efficiency produced by relaxa- 
tion of effort; the stimulating effects of brilliant light or 
ffee are slight compared to the increase in achievement    
   
            
         
   
      
  
-P-A-G-E-514
  496 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
resulting from effective incentives. By dint of strong 
urges to succeed, the effects of excessive fatigue, loss of 
sleep, deprivations of food and bodily discomfort upon 
mental efficiency may be almost, if not wholly, swept 
aside. It does not follow that such practices should be 
followed without good cause. Excessive effort in such 
emergencies doubtless activates the sympathetic system 
and internal glands described in Chapter VII. In the 
long run, keeping productivity at the maximum under 
unfavorable conditions may lead to disastrous results. 
That few conditions, with exception of certain drugs, can 
keep us from rising to maximum achievements, at least 
temporarily when we will, is a notable possibility that 
need not be misused. Equally notable is the fact that, 
apparently, in normal daily life our productivity is ap- 
preciable less than it might be; it may be greatly in- 
creased by proper incentives. What is more important, 
it may be brought to higher levels and there habituated 
by well motivated and wisely directed practice, eventu- 
ally to work as smoothly and with as little effort as at 
levels which are mediocre. 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. Arguing from analogy with facts presented in the chapter, wha 
are the probable effects upon mental efficiency of: (a) headache, 
(b) “feeling out of sorts,” (c) despondency, (d) indigestion, 
(e) toothache. Would the effects of these conditions vary wit! 
the effort one makes to work or would they have the same effec 
whether one tries to achieve or not? 
2. Does it follow from what was said about the réle of motivatio 
that one should attempt to work himself up to a pitch of intens' 
or exciting effort during everyday work? If you think so, does 
it appear that there are inconsistencies between views presente 
in the present chapter and those presented in Chapter VII? 
3. If too much zeal, effort or distraction results in activating th 
 
-P-A-G-E-515
  THE INFLUENCE OF CONDITIONS = 497 
autonomic system, would continuous work under such condi- 
tions be advisable? 
. Are there any dangers to be encountered in the continual use of 
incentives aside from possible physiological effects? 
. What, in general, are the best forms of motivation, or, to put it 
another way, what is the best state of mind for efficient daily 
work? 
. From the studies of variations in efficiency during the day, 
what hours are probably the best for important tests in type- 
writing, playing the piano, pole vaulting, history, sending tele- 
graph messages? 
. Explain the assumption that in the case of the habitual smoker, 
deprivation of smoking might have, irrespective of the physio- 
logical effect of the drug, a deleterious influence on efficiency. 
. Judging from statements made in the text, is it likely that we 
are very good judges of when we are highly efficient and when 
we are not? Mainly, what are the criteria by means of which 
we judge our efficiency? 
. Collect the opinions of ten people of your acquaintance con- 
cerning the effect of caffeine on efficiency. What reasons do 
they give for their views? Contrast such evidence with the 
conclusions drawn from scientific experimentation. 
. What are the real reasons why good ventilation is important? 
The false reasons? 
. Give illustration from your own experience of (a) a situation 
where feelings of fatigue preceded loss of efficiency; (b) a situa- 
tion where loss of efficiency preceded feelings of fatigue; (c) a 
situation where the decrease of worry and excitement increased 
mental ability; (d) a situation where the elimination of unneces- 
sary muscular fatigue made an increased amount of mental work 
possible. 
. At what time of the day do you think you can perform mental 
work most efficiently? Plan in detail an experiment to test this 
opinion. What precautions would it be necessary to observe? 
. Do the experiments on temperature and humidity have any 
bearing on the problem of the difference found between races 
living near the equator and races living nearer to the poles? 
. Diagram roughly what happens in a nervous system when an 
individual learns to disregard a distracting stimulus. (See 
Chapter X.)

  CHAPTER XVII 
THE NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
A field of research in psychology which has developed 
with unusual rapidity, yielding facts that have been prac- 
tically applied in a most extensive and useful way, is 
concerned with individual differences. The discoveries of 
the nature and significance of variations among indi- 
viduals, the invention and improvements of instruments 
of measurement, the development of statistical devices 
needed to handle the results, and the use of the results 
in assisting human adjustments in many phases of life 
have been mainly the results of research conducted during 
the last twenty-five years. At the present time, the 
accumulated facts and experiences are sufficient to estab- 
lish unquestionably the permanent value of the applica- 
tions of differential psychology. To some of the facts and 
practices in this phase of psychology, the next three chap- 
ters will be mainly devoted. In the present one will be 
considered some of the general characteristics of indi- 
vidual differences and their causes. 
Individuals of the same age differ greatly in every| 
trait that has been measured or estimated. In height, 
weight, and strength; in susceptibility to disease, nervous} 
stability and mental balance; in intellect, character, ‘and! 
skill; and in aptitudes for special subjects, arithmetic, 
spelling, music or athletics individual variations ar 
found. These facts have been implicitly assumed in th 
discussions of the preceding sections; in the present chap- 
ter they will be treated with more precision.

NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 501 
The differences between members of the human species 
are quantitative. People are qualitatively the same in 
the sense that they have in some degree the same in- 
stincts, emotions, and capacities to learn, to perceive, re- 
member, imagine, reason, and to be satisfied and annoyed. 
The physicists who have analyzed the “qualities” of tones 
of the human voice, of the violin, and of other instru- 
ments, find that the most subtle variations are due to the 
quantities of many constituent tonal elements which have 
been identified and measured. So with human traits, 
final analysis will probably show all variations to be due 
to quantitative combinations of specific abilities, which 
sooner or later may be discerned and measured. A human 
trait, such as initiative, vivacity or trustworthiness is, in 
the case of each individual, a composite of many kinds of 
abilities each present in a definite amount.

THe AMOUNT AND CHARACTER OF INDIVIDUAL

An idea of the range of ability found among indi- 
viduals of the same age and the same general home and 
school environment is indicated in the accompanying 
table which shows the average of the two best and the 
two poorest scores, in each function, found among 50 
   
-P-A-G-E-520
  502 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
children of approximately the same age in a New York 
school. 
The most rapid readers cover nearly twice as much 
material per minute as the slowest; the best in word 
knowledge attain scores over twice as high as the poorest; 
the best in spelling correctly spell three times as many 
words as the poorest, and similar differences exist be- 
tween the extremes in other abilities. The variations 
among the pupils in the same school grade in the average 
school are nearly as great. 
These are merely statements of the differences between 
the best and poorest. The nature of individual differ- 
ences in general are disclosed only by taking into account 
all the members of a group. For convenience in presenta- 
tion we shall take at first a small group of children of the 
same age and observe the character of thé differences in 
a single trait. In the accompanying table dre the scores 
in a reading test obtained by 24 children, age 11 years.

In the distribution of abilities in this small group are 
found rough illustrations of the main facts concerning 
individual differences of individuals who are of approx- 
imately the same age and circumstances, namely: 
1. The variations among individuals are wide. | 
2. The variations are continuous from one extreme to 
the other. 
3. The individuals are clustered around a central or 
average ability rather than at the extremes. 
Better pictures of the general features of individual 
variations are secured by taking larger groups of indi- 
viduals of the same age. In Figures 56, 57, and 58 are 
given surfaces of frequency for different traits. The

What would be the shape of the frequency surface if an

ber of pennies have computed what the distribution 
would be. It is given in Figure 61 and is known by 
various names, such as the theoretical probability curve

(or surface), or the normal curve of distribution, or the 
curve of chance. Since the surfaces of distribution for 
human traits parallel closely the distributions of chance 
events in smaller numbers, it seems safe to assume that 
an infinite number of measurements of people of a given 
age selected at random would produce a curve identical 
with the theoretical probability curve, which portrays the 
outcome of an infinite number of tossings of pennies or 
other chance events. 
By a chance occurrence is meant not a happening with- 
out a cause but an event determined by a large number of 
independent causes. To account for each penny’s posi- 
tion, head or tail, would require knowledge of a very 
large number of events happening in the box, in the air 
and on the table during the process of shaking and toss- 
ing. The position of each penny, nevertheless, is deter- 
mined by definite causes, not by miracles. 
THE Causss or INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES. 
The implication of the preceding paragraph is that the 
differences among individuals in any given trait are due 
to the large number of causal factors which operate inde- 
pendently. To account for the position in the group of 
a particular individual it would be necessary to ascertain 
a great many different determining factors and to dis- 
cover in what way and to what degree each had exercised 
its effect. 
Individual differences spring from causes that may be 
considered under two broad headings: 
1. The contributions of heredity or native endowment. 
2. The contributions of environment, that is, of the 
physical and social surroundings, of education 
and experience.

510 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Individual Differences Due to Heredity.—The in- 
| herited determiners of a human trait are numerous. If 
one’s height, for example, could be measured in hun- 
dredths of an inch, we would find the total determined in 
part by the thickness of the scalp, the thickness of the top 
layer of the skull, the vertical length of the head, the 
length of many vertebra in the neck and back, the thick- 
ness of cartilages between them, and so on through a 
series of anatomical traits until the soles of the feet are 
reached. Each of these traits may be inherited more or 
less completely independently of the others. The char- 
acter of growth, too, may depend upon the inherited 
capacity of various glands which affect digestion, assim- 
ilation and distribution of materials, upon inherited dis- 
positions to resist disease, fatigue and undernourishment. 
The number of inherited traits which may to some extent 
determine an individual’s height at any time is probably 
legion. To disentangle and weigh them is a task which 
has been barely begun. Doubtless many factors have 
not as yet been discovered and of those which have been 
identified the specific effects are but roughly known. 
All that is inherited, strictly speaking, is inherent in 
the germ cells from which the individual develops. But 
each character in the germ cell, the development of which 
may exercise effects on many traits is determined in part 
by various influences. In part, it is determined by the in- 
dividual’s sex, in part by race and by particular ancestors 
from the parents back through unnumbered generations. 
In the case of height, men are on the average taller than 
women, some races are taller than others, and among 
‘members of the same sex and race, some families are 
taller than others. Each and every one of our ancestors 
contributes in some degree to the amount of any traits we 
possess. The eminent Sir Francis Galton found that of
-P-A-G-E-529

one’s native endowment, on the average one-half is con- 
tributed by one’s parents, one-fourth by the four grand- 
parents, one-eighth by the eight great-grandparents, one- 
sixteenth by the sixteen great-great-grandparents, and so 
on back. What one’s status in a particular trait will be, 
in so far as it is due to heredity, then, will depend upon a 
large number of independent causes. All of the factors 
which brought about all of the marriages in one’s whole 
ancestral history must be included among the causes of 
one’s status in traits which are to some degree inherited. 
Inherited Traits Usually “Normally” Distributed.— 
Some traits are mainly due to heredity. The length of 
the nose, the circumference of the head, height and, as 
we shall see later, retentiveness, general intellectual 
capacity and perhaps other traits such as mental balance, 
susceptibility to emotional disturbances or tuberculosis. 
Where traits of these sorts have been measured in large 
representative groups of similar age and surroundings, the 
distributions usually approximate the normal curve. This. 
must mean that the number of independent factors 
which enter into the heredity of peoples of the same age, 
sex and race is very large; so large and independent as to 
ield a distribution that approximates the arrangement 
pf results mechanically produced by innumerable causes 
as in shaking dice. This being the case, it is customary 
o assume that where an inherited trait is at present un- 
measurable, it varies in amounts among individuals in 
approximately the form of the bell-shaped curve unless 
»vidence to the contrary is adduced. In other words, 
where a native trait, such as emotional susceptibility, or 
the native capacities involved in mechanical work, has 
not been measured and is not known to have been modi- 
ied in some constant way in a group of the same age, sex 
und race, the most probable prediction—the best guess— 
   
-P-A-G-E-530
  512 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
is that the trait is distributed in approximately the form 
of the normal curve among these people. 
The Influence of Environment on Individual Differ- 
ences.—Under environment are included all factors in 
living experience which may affect in any way any human 
traits. Accidents, deprivations and disease ; foods, poisons 
and stimulants; habits, good or bad; home conditions, 
school conditions, companions, teachers, books, religion, 
social institutions, customs, incentives, punishments and 
other phases of experience are to be included. Some traits 
such as the color of the eyes, height and retentiveness 
are not greatly influenced by any save very unusual en- 
vironmental factors; others like the color of the skin, 
knowledge of historical facts or interest in music are 
more greatly influenced by surroundings, training and 
other events or circumstances of life. The traditional 
question as to which is more potent in determining what 
one is and does, heredity or environment, cannot be 
answered intelligibly in general; it must be answered 
specifically for each of the innumerable human traits. 
The effect of environment varies from very little to very 
great. At present,ur interest is in the nature of the 
effects of living, whether great or small, upon the char- 
acter of individual difference in a group of people. 
In almost any trait, the number of scars on the body, 
ability to read or speed of running a hundred yards and| 
other traits upon which environment may have som 
influence, changes may be produced by a great many un- 
related causes. The number of unrelated events and| 
circumstances which may add to the number of scars on| 
one’s skin are simply legion. Suppose it were possible t 
collect a thousand boys of the same age and the sam 
native capacity for learning. They would surely diffe 
in reading ability and these differences would be cause
-P-A-G-E-531
x 
NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 513 
largely by environmental factors. The number of en- 
vironmental influences would be enormous; poverty and 
wealth, health and strength, encouragement by parents, 
influence of chums, distance and quality of school, skill 
and interest of teachers, presence of books at home and 
school, and so on to an almost endless list of factors which 
would vary in degrees among the thousand children. In 
pevianis, fa ae a ees ona influence of an enormous number of more or lessinde- 
pendent f factors, just as in the case of coins shaken in a 
box, or of ancestral factors concerned in heredity. This _ 
being the case, in so far as the traits of individuals result 
fvom environmental factors of these numerous kinds, the 
traits will tend to be distributed in a group of individuals 
according to the normal probability curve. Thus the 
number of scars on the bodies of a thousand individuals of 
the same age, or the reading ability of those of the same 
age and native aptitude would be expected to approxi- 
imate the normal curve. 
B Both heredity and environment, then, in the main, 
tend toward the f i diff 
tributed according to normal probability, as outlined by 
the bell-shaped curve of chance. Where traits are deter- 
Imined in some degree by both, which is the usual case, 
the result is merely an enlargement of the number of 
causes and consequently no lessening of tendency toward 
he “normal” distribution. This does not mean that 
any: limited group of the same age, sex and race will be 
0 distributed. For example, if we took not a representa- 
ive sampling of all ten year old American boys but only 
he 10 per cent most apt in reading, the distribution for 
eading ability might not be “normal.” If the biggest 
erican soldiers were sent to battle first and were killed, 
he distribution of heights among American soldiers re-

maining would not be normal. Furthermore, if only 
those boys of age ten who were natively most gifted were 
taught reading and the others given no training, the dis- 
tribution of the whole group would probably not be 
normal. Thus by limiting the character of individuals in 
a group or by differentiating in some constant way the 
influence of environment, the form of the distribution of 
abilities may be changed from the “chance” distribution. 
In the groups we are likely to find available under ordi- 
nary conditions, one or more factors of selection or one 
or more constant environmental condition may have been 
at work. It is, therefore, advisable to ascertain by eXperi- 
ment what the form of distribution is in typical groupz. 
such as the third grade in school, college seniors, nurses, 
physicians.

than curves with two peaks and a deep valley between, 
or curves with most individuals clustered at one or the 
ther extreme. If a million pupils of the same grade, 
nstead of but 254 as in this grade, were measured, the 
approximation to the normal curve would be closer, in 
ull likelihood. In Figure 63 the frequency surfaces for

Some Properties of the Normal Curve.—The theo 
retical surface of frequency has a number of mathematica 
properties that may be utilized in dealing with groups i 
which an ability is distributed in approximately the forn 
of that surface. Most of these properties are too tech 
nical for description here, but one sample may be given

the whole area remains (since in the theoretical curv

the several sections of the normal curve. Since achiev 
ments of groups of children in a given grade or student 
in a given class in college tend to approximate the norm:

ment of final class marks.

Applying Properties of thé Normal Curve to the Grad-

Of the students taking Philosophy 55 per cent received 
‘A’s” and but 2 per cent “F’s”; of those taking Chem- 
try, 1 per cent received “A’s” and 28 per cent “Fs,” 
hile the proportions for other courses are distributed 
etween these extremes. Recent work in testing more 
xtensively the abilities of students in college depart- 
ents makes it quite certain that such assignments of 
ades are not fairly representative of the variations in 
he abilities of students electing the several courses. The 
eal achievements within each group approximate more 
losely the distributions found in the normal probability 
urve and consequently the grades should approximate 
hose percentages more closely. 
Soon after the irregularities in grading were revealed, 
he university adopted a scheme of assigning marks which 
mbraced the five divisions and percentages as given in 
 
-P-A-G-E-536
    518 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Figure 64. The approximations to this ideal classification 
during one semester were as follows: Excellent, 3.9 per 
cent; superior, 19.7 per cent; medium, 51.0 per cent; 
inferior, 16.8 per cent, and failure, 8.5 per cent. 
The plan of grading in accordance with the normal 
curve of distribution should not be applied too rigidly 
especially to small classes. The smaller the class, in gen- 
eral, the greater the deviations of ability are likely to be. 
Some courses, moreover, may attract superior students. 
In general, however, grades should correspond fairly 
closely to the normal distribution in the long run unless 
good reasons for exceptions are known.

With the variations among individuals in a group as 
great as they are, many difficulties have been encountered| 
in dealing mathematically with data, such as scores in 
intelligence tests, involving a whole group or several! 
groups. These difficulties have been greatly allayed by 
the development of statistical methods,—methods of re- 
ducing quantitative statements for all the members of 
group to some single mathematical formula. Into thos 
devices we shall not enter except to illustrate the mean- 
ing of a coefficient of correlation,—a statistical expression] 
we shall need to know in order to understand several fact 
to be presented in the next two chapters. 
The Coefficient of Correlation—In many psychologi- 
cal investigations it is desirable to ascertain the associa. 
tion or correlation of two traits within a group of indi 
viduals. We may desire, for example, to discover ho 
speed of learning and retentiveness are associated: D 
the persons who learn rapidly retain better, worse, o! 
about the same as those who learn slowly? Or, we ma:
-P-A-G-E-537
  
     
   
                       
   
         NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 519 
desire to ascertain the degree to which height is associated 
with intelligence; how abilities in mathematics corre- 
spond to abilities of the same students in history, and so 
on. What we want, in these cases, is a simple expression 
of the general association of these two abilities within a 
whole group. The coefficient of correlation, whose symbol 
is r, is a statistical device for securing a statement of such 
an association. 
We shall give here no detailed account of the methods 
by which the coefficient of correlation is computed but 
merely a simple illustration of its significance. In the 
series of columns below, suppose that the first numbers 
of each pair represent the ranks of ten different pupils, 
A, B, GC, ete., in the rate of learning. The most rapid 
learner is given rank 1, the next rank 2, and so on to the 
lowest indicated by 10. In the second column of the 
pair, the rank of the same pupil (A or B or C, ete.) in 
retentiveness is given. The coefficient of correlation is a

single statement of the central tendency of relations be- 
tween abilities indicated in the two columns. 
In sample I there is a perfect positive correlation be- 
tween abilities in the two traits, X and Y, which means 
that each pupil has in one trait the same relative ability 
that he has in the other. Perfect correlation which is 
indicated by r. = + 1.00 is extremely rare among human 
traits. In the second sample, the coefficient is + 0.91, 
a very high positive correlation which allows, however, 
for some shifting of positions. Pupil A, best in trait X, 
is third in Y; Pupil B, second in X, is first in Y, and so 
on. The third sample, r. = + 0.51, is a substantial but 
not very high positive correlation; its meaning will be 
best understood by examining the data of the columns. 
In IV, the correlation is zero, the result that is approxi- 
mated when the arrangement is left entirely to chance, 
as would be the case, for example, if the positions under' 
X and Y were determined by drawing the numbers from| 
a hat. From zero to minus 1.00 is a range of negative 
correlations, in which the ranks in one trait are the re- 
verse, in various degrees, of those in the other. Sampl 
V, in which r. = — 0.63, illustrates a fairly high nega 
tive correlation.

CHAPTER XVIII 
INTELLIGENCE 
In the preceding chapter it was stated that all so-called 
human “qualities” are really complexes or composites of 
particular abilities existing in definite amounts ranging 
from zero up. This applies to the human trait, intelli- 
gence, which will serve as an excellent example of both 
the theoretical value and the practical usefulness of the 
measurement of complex traits. 
The fact that individuals differ in ability to learn, to 
adjust to novel situations and to manage things, people 
and ideas has been repeatedly observed throughout the 
course of recorded history. In the early stages of experi- 
mental psychology, efforts were made to measure more 
precisely some of the aspects of intelligence. In 1880, 
Ebbinghaus first succeeded in devising tests of ability to 
memorize various materials with sufficient accuracy to 
portray individual variations. Following this notable 
accomplishment, many types of single tests, such as the 
completion of sentences in which certain words were 
omitted, the completion of pictures, the speed of recog- 
nizing figures, words or sentences, the cancellation of 
letters from specified materials, arithmetical operations, 
association tests, etc., were suggested as possible touch- 
stones of general intelligence. The search for a single 
test, guided by the belief that intelligence was a single 
unitary power that might disclose itself in clean-cut 
fashion in a single task or situation, inevitably led to but 
partial success. 
523 
 
-P-A-G-E-542
  524 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
It remained for Alfred Binet, a distinguished French 
psychologist, to conceive the idea that intelligence was 
not a single quality or power, but a complex of abilities. 
The effect of this belief was a radical change in the 
method of approach to the problem. Conceiving intelli- 
gence to be not homogeneous but possessing many aspects, 
Binet began a search for many types of performances or 
problems in which intelligent behavior should be dis- 
played. Believing also that intelligence was largely 
native, although recognizing the fact that previous ex- 
perience influences the results of most psychological tests, 
Binet began by searching for bits of information available 
to children in all walks of life, and for problems, puzzles, 
questions, mental tasks of various types that were not 
likely to be encountered under ordinary home or school 
conditions. The information sought, then, was of the 
sort that every child has ample opportunity to acquire, 
and the problems of a type that no child was likely to 
have previously learned to solve. 
Tue Brner-Stuon Trsts. 
Tye ae ta , 
After fifteen years of work, in part of which he was 
assisted by Theodore Simon, Binet published in 1908 the 
series of tests known as the Binet-Simon Scale of Intelli- 
gence. It consists of 59 individual tests which. are 
arranged in an order of difficulty. The easiest may be 
passed by an average three-year-old child, the most diffi- 
cult requires the ability of an average twelve year old. 
Stimulated by this successful achievement, a large 
number of extensions and revisions of the scale have been 
made in many countries. In America the work has been 
specially active, and among the several revisions, that by 
Terman, known as the Stanford Revision and Extension 
of the Binet-Simon Scale, is most thorough. This scale  
-P-A-G-E-543
  INTELLIGENCE 525 
consists of 90 tests arranged, like the original, in order of 
difficulty from some that should be passed by a three- 
year-old child to others that demand “superior adult” 
ability. 
What the scale actually measures may be explained 
more readily after an examination of some of the tests. 
In the group for age 3 are the following tasks: 
Points to the nose, eyes, mouth, hair. To pass the test, the 
child must succeed in 3 of the 4 tasks. 
Names familiar objects—key, penny, closed knife, watch, pencil. 
Subject. must succeed in 3 of the 5 tests. 
Enumerates at least 3 objects seen in 1 of 3 pictures displayed 
separately. 
Gives sex, i.e., boy or girl. 
Gives last name. 
Repeats sentence containing 6 or 7 syllables; eg., “The dog runs 
after the cat.” 
Repeats 3 digits, one success in 3 trials. 
In the group for age 10 are the following: 
Defines satisfactorily at least 30 words of a list of 50, ranged in 
order from easy to difficult. Words at about the 10-year level of 
difficulty are: bewail, priceless, disproportionate, tolerate, artless, 
| depredation, lotus, frustrate. The hardest words in the list, which 
are mainly too difficult for the average adult, are: piscatorial, 
sudorific, parterre, shagreen, and complot. 
Detects the “absurdity” in 4 out of 5 statements such as the fol- 
lowing: “A man said: ‘I know a road from my house to the city 
which is down hill all the way to the city and down hill all the way 
back home.’ ” 
Copies from memory a geometrical figure previously studied for 
10 seconds. 
Gives satisfactory answers to 2 out of 3 questions such as the fol- 
lowing: “What ought you to say when someone asks your opinion 
about a person you don’t know very well?” 
Must be able to say spontaneously at least 60 words—any words 
of which the subject can think—in a period of 3 minutes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-544
526 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Among the 90 tests in the Stanford Revision of the 
Scale are many which measure the ability to manipulate 
mentally familiar facts, such as repeating digits forwards 
and backwards, counting backwards, visualizing changes 
of the hands of a clock; to reason out the solution of 
problems which utilize the facts of arithmetic, of physical 
relations, and of practical situations. In some tests, the 
knowledge of abstract facts and relations is demanded: 
e.g., in defining such words as pity, revenge, charity, envy; 
in giving the similarities in three things, such as wool, 
cotton, leather; the differences between a President and 
a King or between poverty and misery; in grasping the 
thought contained in a short paragraph, or in giving the 
meaning of pictures or fables. In general, the Binet test 
seems to include a variety of tasks on which the mental 
abilities described in our previous chapters on learning, 
the acquisition of ideas, especially abstract ideas and 
reasoning or problem solving, depend. Indeed, these 
were precisely the aims of Binet and his followers. They 
attempted to secure tests of various abilities to learn, 
especially to learn complicated and abstract facts, and 
also to profit by experience in a general way. They tried 
to secure tests that would indicate native ability to adapt 
one’s self to new situations, to see the problem, hold it in 
mind, and reason out the solution. In these tasks, it is 
assumed that mental alertness, keenness, quickness and 
breadth of grasp, as well as suppleness, accuracy, and 
control would be involved. 
PERFORMANCE TESTS. 
The Stanford-Binet is largely a verbal test; mainly the 
responses are made orally to questions or problems pre- 
sented orally by the examiner. It cannot, therefore, be 
used successfully with deaf or foreign children or with
-P-A-G-E-545
  
INTELLIGENCE 527 
children having speech defects. For such cases, and for 
others who are clumsy in handling language, graded series 
of performance tests have been constructed along lines 
similar to those adopted by Binet. Of these, the most

Group Trsts. 
Like the Binet Scale, the Pintner-Paterson series is an 
instrument of precision, carefully standardized, which 
must be given to subjects individually by trained exam- 
iners. To meet the demands for more extensive testing, 
various forms of group tests which may be administéred 
by competent people without extensive training have 
been devised. | 
Group tests may be divided roughly into two types, 
the verbal and the non-verbal, although many include 
both types of material. Of the verbal tests, the most 
familiar is the “Army Alpha,” devised by a group of 
American psychologists and applied to more than a mil- 
lion and’a half men in the American Army during the 
Great War. 
The Army Alpha test, given to recruits who could read| 
and write, consists of 212 separate questions, exercises, or 
problems of eight general types, of which four are here 
illustrated. 
The first group of tests comprised twelve tasks ranging 
from easy to hard, of the following type: 
The examiner says: “Attention, 
Look at the square and triangle at 3. 
nes When I say ‘Gq.’ make a cross in the} 
space which is in the triangle but not! 
in the square, and also make a figure 1 in the space which 
is in the triangle and in the square—‘Go!’” (Allow not 
over ten seconds.) 
Test 2 consists of 20 arithmetic problems.  
-P-A-G-E-547
INTELLIGENCE 529 
Test 3 consists of 16 “common sense” problems. The 
subject is to make the best answer. The easiest and most 
difficult are: (1) Cats are useful animals because—they 
catch mice; they are gentle; they are afraid of dogs. 
(16) Why is it colder nearer the poles than at the equa- 
tor? Because—the poles are always farther from the 
sun; the sunshine falls obliquely at the poles; there is 
more ice at the poles. 
Test 4 consists of 40 pairs of words, the two words of 
each pair being either synonyms or antonyms. The ex- 
aminee is to underline same or opposite where appro- 
priate. The first and last pairs are: 
BVOC VG.i5 «Pec 61S sinio\> «ose NMR SCatoy ciel sgot same—opposite 
Encomium—eulogy ...............00% same—opposite 
There are many other verbal group tests, some espe- 
cially designed for elementary schools, some for high 
schools, some for colleges, and others for use among 
clerical and other occupational groups. Non-verbal 
group examinations have been devised to test very young 
children, illiterates, and others who cannot read or write 
words. In some of these examinations directions are con- 
veyed orally; in others by means of pantomime. A variety 
of tasks are provided, such as to draw a line to indicate 
the shortest path through a maze, to fill in the missing 
part of a picture, to strike out an irrelevant part, or to 
complete a series of marks begun according to a fixed 
plan. In each type of test, problems ranging from easy 
to hard are provided. 
The various types of tests and scales are not exactly 
equivalent. They do not all measure identical abilities, 
although there is much in common among them. It will 
be advisable, therefore, to confine the discussion mainly 
to one test, the Stanford-Binet,
-P-A-G-E-548
  530 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Mentau AGE AND THE INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT. 
The Mental Age.—To make the subject’s score on an 
intelligence test meaningful, a standard of comparison 
must be provided. The method adopted by Binet, and 
by many others later, was to use the average perform- 
ances of individuals of different“ages as a standard of 
comparison. Binét~ascertained just what the average 
scote~aehieved by a group of three-year-old children, 
four-year-old, etc., was. Of course, in such a procedure 
care must be exercised to get a sufficient number of rep- 
resentative children for each age: not merely a few bright 
ones or dull ones, but all kinds, picked at random, giving 
a distribution of ability approximating the normal surface 
of frequency. When this is done, it becomes possible to 
state a child’s achievement in terms of the age at which 
the child of average ability would secure the same score. 
This score is called the “Mental Age” or the “M.A.” for 
short. Thus, a particular child whose achievement in 
the test is equivalent to the Mental Age of ten years 
has the general mental ability of the average ten-year 
old; it matters not what the actual chronological age of 
the particular child may be. 
The Mental Age, then, gives us a statement of the 
general mental ability of a subject at the time of the test 
in comparison with average children of different ages. 
If a ten-year-old child earns an M.A. of 10, he has 
average mental ability. If he earns an M.A. of eleven 
years he is obviously superior to the average; if he earns 
an M.A. of eight years, he is markedly inferior. The 
Mental Age is really a statement of a child’s mental 
maturity at the time, and this implies, of course, that 
general mental ability grows or matures. There is, in- 
deed, fairly substantial evidence that general mental
-P-A-G-E-549
  INTELLIGENCE 531 
ability as measured by the Binet test grows gradually 
and about as uniformly as height to a maximum of ma- 
turity which is reached about the same time, i.e., in the 
late teens. Terman has placed the average age of ma- 
\turity at 16, although others have put the date at various 
points between 13.2 and 20. These are approximate 
statements of the average; particular individuals mature

Figure 67.) 
The Intelligence Quotient.—For practical purposes, we 
want to know more than merely the amount of general 
mental ability at the moment; we wish to know, if pos- 
sible, how rapidly the child’s mental ability will develop. 
We desire to be able to predict growth in mental ability;

  Quotient is obtained by dividing by the chronological 
age the mental age received on a test like the Stanford- | 
Binet. For example: Pupil A has an M.A. of 10 years 
and a chronological age of 10 years. Divide M.A.10 by {
-P-A-G-E-551
INTELLIGENCE 533 
C.A.10, the Intelligence Quotient is 1.00; Pupil B, whose 
chronological age is also 10, has an M.A. of 12; 12 divided 
by 10 gives an I.Q. of 1.20. Pupil C, also 10 years of 
age, earns an M.A. of 8, which divided by 10, gives an 
1.Q. of .80. Usually the decimal is disregarded; we say 
that A has an I.Q. of one hundred, B of one hundred 
twenty and C of eighty. The Intelligence Quotient. is 
obviously a ratio—the ratio of the Mental Age to the 
Chronological Age. 
The value of the Intelligence Quotient for purposes of 
prediction depends upon the fact that it is found to be— 
at least approximately—constant from year to year. This 
fact is ascertained by repeatedly testing, at intervals of 
a year or more, the same individuals with the same tests. 
Thus far, the Stanford, and to some extent other revi- 
sions of the Binet Scale, are the only ones that have been 
tried out in this way. A number of investigations have 
shown that the I.Q. on a retest at an interval of a year 
or more varies somewhat in particular cases, but on the 
average the change is 5 points or less. (See Figures 66 
and 67.) : 
The Intelligence Quotient indicates, then—at least 
approximately—the rate of mental growth. An LQ. of 
100 means that the child probably has grown, is now 
growing, and will continue to grow in mental ability at 
the average rate. An I.Q. of 120 means a growth 20 
per cent more rapid; an I.Q. of 75 means growth 25 per 
cent less rapid than the average. Since the I.Q. remains 
approximately constant from year to year, it expresses 
the relative brightness or dullness of an individual. Thus, 
irrespective of age, an I.Q. of 100 means average mental 
alertness, suppleness, breadth of grasp, and capacity to 
learn, whereas a higher I.Q. indicates superiority in these 
respects and a lower I.Q. inferiority. 
   
-P-A-G-E-552
534 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Is GENERAL INTELLIGENCE NATIVE oR ACQUIRED? 
The Binet tests were devised to measure native mental 
aptitudes. What is the evidence that intellectual ca- 
pacities are inherited and that they grow like height to 
a maturity which was essentially predetermined by con- 
ditions in the germ cells? 
The approximate constancy of the Intelligence Quo- 
tient is one line of evidence. If intelligence were essen- 
tially modifiable, the variations in experience would, of 
course, cause corresponding variations in I.Q. But they 
do not. We find, on the one hand, children who have 
enjoyed exceptionally good care at home and school, re- 
maining at approximately the same low I1.Q. For exam- 
ple: “X is the son of unusually intelligent and well- 
educated parents. The home is everything one would 
expect of people of scholarly pursuits and cultivated 
tastes. . . . When brought for examination X was eight 
years old. He had twice attempted school work, but 
could accomplish nothing and was withdrawn. The Binet 
tests gave an I.Q. of approximately 75, that is the retarda- 
tion amounted to about two years. The child was ex- 
amined again three years later. At that time, after at- 
tending school two years, he had recently completed the 
first grade. This time the I.Q. was 73.” 
That school or other formal educational training does 
not greatly increase the I.Q. is shown by such cases as 
' the following: 
“Walter and Frank have been under observation for 
several years. Until the ages of five and seven years, 
they lived in an exceptionally poor home. . . . Both of 
the parents died within a year, and the boys were adopted 
by a woman of decidedly more than average ability, who 
treated them as her own sons. At the time of adoption,
-P-A-G-E-553
  INTELLIGENCE 535 
one tested at 73 and the other at 82. Four years later 
the I.Q.’s were 70 and 77.” 
The writer secured the results of Binet tests from a 
group of 70 school children (Grades 3 to 6 inclusive) 
whose achievements in all of the representative school 
subjects were also carefully measured. During a period 
embracing nearly two school years, unusually intensive 
work in reading, spelling and arithmetic had been done 
with many pupils who were backward in these subjects. 
The improvements in scholastic attainments varied 
greatly among the subjects who were, near the end of 
the period, retested with the Binet Scale. Most of the 
pupils showed some change in I.Q., the greatest gain 
being 18 points, from which the changes varied to a loss 
of 12 points, with an average change of about 6 points. 
The important question was whether great gains in I.Q. 
were made by those whose advance in educational 
achievements had been greatest and whether losses in 
I.Q. occurred mainly among those who had made the 
least amount of scholastic progress. There was no asso- 
ciation between the two tendencies; the correlation was 
zero. An increase in I.Q. was found as frequently among 
those whose achievements had been small or average, as 
among those whose progress had been great. Those 
whose educational progress had been great gained in I.Q. 
no more frequently than those whose gains were small or 
average. d 
From these instances, it appears that while the tests 
are still imperfect, they disclose quite clearly the fact 
that there are innate mental capacities, the growth of 
which is not greatly accelerated or retarded by intensive 
school training. The general tendency of the I.Q. to 
remain constant implies that, in the main, individuals 
are born and tend to remain at a level which is relatively 
 
-P-A-G-E-554
  536 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
low, average, or high. This is the rule, although there 
are exceptions. 
(High, low, and average mental ability tends to run 
in-families in much the same way as height, eye color, 
and other physical features.) The inheritance of intelli- 
gence is most vividly illustrated in the lineage of extreme 
cases, of which the ‘“Kallikak” family is a notorious ex- 
ample. Martin Kallikak, a youthful soldier in the 
American revolution, met a feeble-minded girl who bore 
him a son of low mentality. In 1912 there were four 
hundred and eighty known direct descendants of this 
union. Of these, one hundred and forty-three were of 
such low mentality as to be classified as feeble-minded, 
and most of the others were of relatively low mental 
ability. In addition, thirty-three of the latter were 
sexually immoral, thirty-six of illegitimate birth, and 
twenty-four confirmed alcoholics. | 
Contrast the dark picture of the Kallikaks with the 
accomplishments of the Edwards family. Of Jonathan 
Edwards, born in 1703, there were, in 1900, 1394 identi- 
fied descendants of whom thirteen were college presi- 
dents, sixty-five college professors, sixty physicians, one 
hundred clergymen, seventy-five army or navy officers, 
sixty prominent authors, one hundred lawyers, thirty 
judges, eighty prominent public officials, and a great 
many successful bankers, business men, landowners, etc. 
None was known to be of feeble mentality, and none was 
known to have committed a crime, while many achieved 
great eminence in their profession. 
Tue SIGNIFICANCE OF GENERAL INTELLIGENCE. 
The implication of the preceding section is that gen- 
eral intelligence, provisionally defined as a composite 
measure of abilities to learn, to grasp broad and subtle
-P-A-G-E-555

acts with alertness and accuracy, to exercise mental con- 
rol, and display flexibility and sagacity in seeking the 
olution of problem-situations, is native—that is, it devel- 
ps fairly steadily like height, reaches a maturity at some 
ime in the teens, and sets for each individual a limit 
f achievement. These implications must be further 
ested. 
We shall first indicate the form of distribution of the 
ntelligence Quotients, and then proceed to study the 
ignificance of the several levels. Generalizing from the 
easurements of groups of representative children, the 
istribution of intelligence would probably be about as 
iven in the following table: 
Q. 120-129 . 
  INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOLASTIC ACHIEVEMENT. 
Inferior Intelligence.—Intelligence Quotients of 20 or 
less are found infrequently. Persons with 1.Q.’s in this 
ange are “idiots,” essentially incapable of learning. In- 
ividuals with I.Q.’s from 20 or 25 to 50 or so are ordi- 
arily called “imbeciles” and all within this range are 
pable of but meagre learning and adaptability. In the 
ange from 50 to 70 1.Q. are found various degrees of 
feeble-mindedness,” which grade quite imperceptibly 
to the less, but nevertheless seriously, dull individuals 
bove. Throughout this enormous range, from approxi- 
ately 0 to 70 I.Q., there is absolutely no doubt about 
 
-P-A-G-E-556
  538 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
the innate limitations upon the acquisition of comple: 
mental functions, and the rate of acquisition where learn. 
ing is possible at all. It is almost invariably futile t 
attempt to teach children of I.Q.’s less than 50 to read, 
spell or do arithmetic. Genuine comprehension in read- 
ing or arithmetic can seldom be achieved even by thos¢ 
whose I.Q.’s fall between 50 and 60, and the little they d 
learn must be the result of arduous and vielen d 
application. 
In the average case, an I.Q. of 75 is considered about 
the minimum essential for appreciable achievement in 
school work, but many with that degree of intelligence 
fail almost entirely and, at best, progress is slow and soo’ 
halted. The average case can scarcely succeed beyon 
the fifth grade. In the schools most of the pupils recog- 
nized by teachers as “very dull” and “very slow” will be 
found to have I.Q.’s between 70 and 85. Most of these 
children are retarded in their school progress. Children 
* with I.Q.’s between 70 and 85 drop out early in consid- 
erable numbers, but many struggle along to finish the 
eighth grade, 1, 2, 3, 4 or more years retarded. It is 
found that most of those who persist are promoted more 
rapidly than their achievements warrant, mainly because 
they are bigger and older. 
Average Intelligence—Children of average intelli, 
gence—those whose I.Q.’s cluster closely about 100—set 
the pace in the grades. Examining the records of two 
hundred pupils, whose I.Q.’s range from 95 to 105, Ter- 
man found that aside from retardations clearly due to 
loss of schooling through illness or other causes, nearly 
all had made regular progress. The range 95 to 105 1.Q 
includes about thirty-three per cent of the general popu- 
lation and probably about forty per cent of the popula- 
tion of the elementary schools.

Superior Intelligence ——Of fifty-four children between 
20 and 140 I.Q.’s studied by Terman, 12.5 per cent 
ere advanced in the grades two years: 54 per cent 
ere advanced one year; 28 per cent were making aver- 
ge progress; and 5.5 per cent were actually retarded 
me year. Of a group of forty-seven children with a 
edian I.Q. of 145, Terman found none retarded; 8.5 
er cent at the grade corresponding to their age; 29.8 
er cent advanced one year; 29.8 per cent advanced two 
ears; 19.2 per cent three years; and 12.8 per cent four 
ears. This is substantial evidence that the children of 
etter than average I.Q. do exceed the average rate of 
learning such subjects as are taught in school, and that, 
m the whole, the higher the I.Q., the more rapid the 
rogress. : 
Intelligence and Success in High School.—With re- 
ard to the limits of progress of high schools, much de- 
ends upon the standards of the school. I.Q.’s of 100

ions is not known. Among first-year students in Palo 
lto High School, the relation between achievement and

high school. Approximately two-thirds of the group ar 
100 or above, half are 105 or above, and a quarter are 11 
or above in I.Q. At the end of the first year, of thirtee 
who dropped out of school, ten were below the media 
I.Q. (105) and of these, seven had failed in more tha 
half of their subjects. 
Intelligence and Success in College.—The minimu: 
I.Q. required for successful work in college is not defi 
nitely known, since none of the Binet revisions contain 
tests sufficiently difficult to measure high adult intel: 
ligence. 
In college, however, as in the lower schools, the cor. 
relation between intelligence and quality of work is posi 
tive and fairly high. For example, in Columbia Colleg 
the higher the rating on the Thorndike Intelligence test 
the better the achievement in the classroom, on th 
average. In the accompanying table are given, in th 
first column, ranges of scores by tens on the Thorndik 
test (these are not I.Q.’s but raw test scores) and in th 
second column the percentages of students who receive’

semester. To represent each range—i.e., 60 to 70, ete. 
fifty students were selected at random.

“In addition to this regular school work the child has 
overed the following special work in language and 
athematics, either with a tutor or with his mother: 
eometry, algebra, as far as equations; Latin, partial 
nowledge of the four declensions (he has been taught 
y the direct, informal method, and reads easy Latin) ;

Janet near the Twins. He said it was Saturn, but his 
other thought it was Mars. E.... went home,

In sum, there is impressive evidence that general intel 
ligence as measured by the Stanford-Binet tests indi 
cates with a faithfulness that makes it extremely usefu 
practically the rate at which children learn most schoo 
functions. It sets a limit to the kind, difficulty, or com 
plexity of mental functions that can be acquired, and i 
sets a limit to the rate and permanence with which acqui 
sition, within these limits, may go on. Algebra anc 
geometry as now taught, for example, are beyond th 
mental capacities of many, and among those who finc 
these functions within the limits of their capacity, indi 
vidual differences in the rate, comprehensiveness, anc 
permanence of learning will be found, due to difference: 
in endowment. 
INTELLIGENCE AND ParticuLAR ScHOoL SUBJECTS. 
While the results of the Binet tests indicate very wel 
the probable achievements in school work as a whol 
they are not equally symptomatic of capacities in th 
particular subjects. The degree to which the tests indi

by the coefficients of correlation between test scores an 
actual attainments. Taking as groups children ij

These correlations show that the Binet tests do not 
easure native capacity in all scholastic lines equally 
ell. The tests correspond quite closely to the chil- 
ren’s ability in the linguistic and abstract subjects— 
composition, reading, spelling, arithmetic. Children with 
igh I.Q.’s are generally superior to those of lower I.Q.’s 
n these subjects, but they are not markedly superior in 
riting, handwork, and drawing, that is, in mechanical 
nd motor abilities.          
      
          
    
         
  INTELLIGENCE AND VOCATIONAL SUCCESS. 
Intelligence, as measured by the Binet tests, shows 
ubstantial correlations with general scholastic success, 
specially in such subjects which demand linguistic abil- 
ty and the acquisition and manipulation of abstract 
deas. Whether the same relations hold between intelli- 
ence and success in vocations under the more complex 
ituations of life, is a matter worthy of investigation. 
Unfortunately, the number of adults that have been 
easured by the Stanford test is limited. The test was 
ot designed for adults. The Army Alpha, which was 
evised for this purpose, should yield results that are 
uggestive at least. The average scores on the Army 
Ipha test obtained by various occupational groups are 
shown in the following table.

  When comparisons of radically different vocations ar 
made, there is at once perceptible a tendency for voca 
tions which require facility in dealing with words anc 
symbols to stand higher than those which require apti 
tude for manipulating things and mechanisms. Ths 
clerical workers in general excel those engaged in me: 
chanical occupations. The tests appear to have a verba 
and linguistic bias; to favor those skilled in handlin 
words and symbolic concepts as contrasted with thos 
proficient in motor and mechanical abilities. This tend. 
ency appears both in the results of measurements o 
vocational groups as it did in the correlations of schoo 
subjects with the test results. 
Further examination of the data, however, will disclos 
the fact that the intelligence test measures abilities whic 
possess a wider significance. Making comparison withi 
a similar type of occupation, the more skilled worker, 
appear to stand higher on the intelligence scale than th 
less expert. The mechanical engineer and draughtsme 
are above 110, the general electrician and constructio: 
foreman score about 85, the workers on more specifi

tasks, such as automobile repairman, plumber, tool 
maker, bridge carpenter, auto chauffeur, etc., are below 
70, while the unskilled laborers are at the bottom of the 
list. Among the several types of clerical workers, a simi- 
lar correlation between intelligence and occupational 
levels exists. The chaplains surpass the Y.M.C.A. secre- 
taries, the accountants surpass the bookkeepers, the med- 
ical officers are superior to the army nurses. Thus within 
similar occupational lines, general intelligence is asso- 
ciated with levels of proficiency. 
It is significant that the members of the professional 
classes nearly always rank high in intelligence tests. In 
this connection, the average Army Alpha ratings of the 
students in various departments of a representative state 
university will afford interesting comparison with those 
of the occupational groups, just given.

  The medians of the students in most of these profes- 
sional courses are well above all of the army occupational 
groups except the professional classes. A relatively high 
degree of general intelligence of this type is probably 
essential to success in the ministry, law, editorial work, 
medicine, banking, engineering, and other vocations for 
which college training is required.

546 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
A survey of the army occupational groups shows in 
general that those which stand high have probably had, 
on the whole, a greater amount of “schooling” than those 
standing low. The additional fact that college students 
do so well suggests the possibility that success in the 
Alpha test is largely determined by the amount of scho- 
lastic training. While this test probably is influenced 
more than the Binet Scales by education, it. measures 
native capacity in the main, as the following sample data 
imply. t

The scholarship rating was obtained by giving three credits for 
each “hour” of A work, 2 for B, 1 for C, and 0 for D or F. These 
credits were added, and the sum divided by the number of hours of 
work attempted. (From Proctor.) 
The previous education of these groups differed very 
much less than the test scores. High test scores, rather 
than the advantages of previous schooling, seemed to 
foretell most accurately the achievements in the college 
courses. For example, one of the best records was made 
by a man who had the least previous education (5th 
grade) but a high Alpha score. Of four students who 
had previously done only the work of grade eight, two 
whose Alpha scores were very low failed in all of their  
-P-A-G-E-565
  INTELLIGENCE 547 
college subjects; a third whose Alpha score was in the 
second group earned a scholarship rating of 1.00; and 
the fourth, in the highest Alpha group, received a scholar- 
ship rating of 2.18, which was higher than that earned 
by any other student, without regard to previous educa- 
tion, whose Alpha score was below 155, 2.e., below the 
highest Alpha group. 
INTELLIGENCE AND SoctaL ADAPTABILITY AND LEADERSHIP. 
Between intelligence scores and general school success, 
there is a substantial correlation; between intelligence 
and vocational success a marked, but as yet not thor- 
oughly appraised, association. What is the correlation 
of abstract intelligence with social adaptability and lead- 
ership, with ability to get along with and manage people? 
The use of the tests in the Army provided material that 
suggests a fair correlation between fitness for managing 
and leading men and intelligence ratings. The students 
of the Officers’ Training Schools who succeeded in earn- 
ing commissions were on the average of higher intelli- 
gence, according to the tests, than those who failed. 
Among non-commissioned recruits in the cantonments, 
the correlations of fitness for advancement as judged by 
officers and intelligence score was fairly high (.40 to .60). 
Finally, the average intelligence of seasoned troops cor- 
responded fairly closely with military rank. In one 
group, which included approximately 30,000 men, the 
privates obtained an average Alpha score of approxi- 
mately 73, corporals 95, sergeants 107, and commissioned 
officers 139. The overlapping of the intelligence scores 
of one rank upon others was great, however. 
The relation between intelligence and social sagacity, 
adaptability and leadership has been indicated by studies 
of children. Among 150 first-grade pupils, intelligence

correlated with various traits judged by teachers as shown 
in the accompanying table:

  These results show much the same general relations 
as those obtained on adults in the army. All lead to the 
conclusion that the intelligence tests correlate in some 
degree, but by no means perfectly, with the capacities 
required in understanding, getting on with, and managing 
other human beings. 
INTELLIGENCE AND Morau ADJUSTMENTS. 
Fine gradations of moral adjustments are difficult to 
obtain. We may seek for some evidence in the studies 
of the relation of intelligence to delinquency and crime. 
‘Of this association, it is impossible to make a precise 
statement, so diverse are the findings of different investi- 
gators. For example, one authority asserts that “prob- 
ably 80 per cent of the children of the Juvenile Courts in 
Manhattan and Bronx are feeble-minded,” another, that 
of the cases in the Newark Detention Home, N. J., 66 
per cent are “distinctly feeble-minded”; another that 
“one-third of our delinquent children are feeble-minded” ; 
another that about 8 per cent are. For these discrepan- 
cies there are several explanations of which two are im- 
portant: 
(1) The diagnosis of “feeble-mindedness” has not in 
all of the studies been based on tests of intelligence alone;  
-P-A-G-E-567
  INTELLIGENCE 549 
and even when it has been, the line of demarcation be- 
tween “normal” and “feeble-minded” is drawn at dif- 
ferent levels; 
(2) The studies are usually based on different institu- 
tions which are devoted to quite diverse types of delin- 
quency or crime. 
Of the many individual studies, one made by Burt will 
be considered because it is probably fairly typical and 
because of the care with which both intelligence and other 
abilities were measured. The group comprises 107 juve- 
nile delinquents, ages six to fifteen, whose misdemeanors 
include theft, begging, truancy, assault, sexual offences, 
damage to property, and general incorrigibility. The 
average chronological age of the entire group was 13.2 
years, the average mental age 11.3, thus giving an average 
retardation of two years in mental age or an average I.Q. _ 
of 85.6. Analyzing the distribution further, it is found 
that 7 per cent might be classified as “feeble-minded” ; 
20 per cent as very dull; 50 per cent as less dull but below 
average; 25 per cent as about average; and only 2 per 
cent as slightly above average. Supernormal intelligence 
among children is not incompatible with delinquency; 
but delinquents of high intelligence are rare. While the 
proportion of feeble-mindedness in the delinquent group 
is not great, it is at least five times as great as the pro- 
- portion of feeble-mindedness in the total population. 
_ The more significant fact, however, is that the delinquent 
group, as a whole, is a dull group; only 2 per cent are 
above the average. 
Typically, then, the delinquent child is a dull child but 
not all dull children are delinquent. Social and moral 
deficiency is explained by dullness plus something else, or, 
probably, plus several other things. To some extent, the 
other traits are probably emotional and temperamental
-P-A-G-E-568
  550 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
deficiencies or nervous instability. The compelling drives 
of the dominant urges, the incapacity for sustained effort, 
fickleness of interest, or the disrupting effects of unstable 
but impulsive emotions when combined with dullness of 
mind provide an organism readily susceptible to mis- 
demeanor and crime. Many delinquent children are, how- 
ever, not obviously instable or excessively impulsive or 
deficient in restraint. Environmental factors—unfavor- 
able home, school or street influences—are sometimes the 
inciting causes. 
ConcLUSIONS. 
The results of tests, such as the Binet or the Army 
Alpha, together with studies of the inheritance of mental 
traits lead to the assumption of general intelligence. By 
intelligence is meant a group or composite of native ca- 
pacities for learning along the lines that require mental 
operations with verbal, symbolic and abstract materials. 
In these fields, the more intelligent person learns more 
rapidly, displays greater mental keenness, accuracy and 
control in meeting new problem-situations, and is capable 
of ascending to higher levels of achievement than the less 
intelligent person. 
The intelligence tests do not measure all types of ca- 
pacities to learn, but those which are tested are of great 
importance. Upon such capacities mainly depends 
achievement in school and colleges and success in many 
vocations. Social adaptability, proficiency in managing 
people, and effectiveness of moral adjustments are also 
associated to an appreciable degree with this type of in- 
telligence. The correlation of intelligence with ability to 
acquire various mechanical and motor skills—writing, 
drawing, painting, athletics, and various mechanical 
trades—is positive but low.

. Following are definitions of intelligence offered by other writers. 
Which of these are most serviceable and valid? 
a “The general capacity of an individual consciously to adjust 
his thinking to new requirements.’”—Stern. 
b “An individual is intelligent in proportion as he is able to 
carry on abstract thinking.”—L. M. Terman. 
c “To judge well, understand well, reason well, these are the 
essentials of intelligence.”—Alfred Binet. 
d “Intelligence seems to be a biological mechanism by which 
the effects of a complexity of stimuli are brought together 
and given a somewhat unified effect in behavior.” 
—Joseph Peterson. 
. Basing your opinion on the facts presented in the chapter, does 
it appear that the definitions above are too broad or too narrow 
to define what the present tests actually measure? 
. Aside from tests, what features or kinds of behavior disclose in 
some measure the degree of intelligence that a person may have? 
For example, are table manners or English usages indicative of 
intelligence? , 
. In which of the following types of work is a high degree of 
intelligence probably useful or necessary: driving an automobile, 
fishing with nets, splitting wood, taking shorthand dictation, 
barbering, preaching, teaching, running a riveting machine, 
writing poetry, selling toy balloons, selling bonds. In which of 
these activities are traits other than intelligence important? 
What traits? 
. Is it possible that for some tasks too much intelligence as well 
as too little intelligence would be a handicap? Give examples 
and tell why a college graduate of superior mind would do the 
job badly? 
. What services could an expert in intelligence testing render to the 
work in: (a) a juvenile court; (b) a hospital for neurotic chil- 
‘dren; (c) a public school; (d) a criminal court; (e) a home 
for orphans; (f) an automobile factory; (g) a large department 
store; (h) an immigration bureau; (i) the army or navy. 
. Explain in some plausible way the fact that intelligent people, 
on the whole, are less conceited than are dull.

  ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
To what extent are the factors which are involved in reasoning 
also involved in taking intelligence tests? Do you think the 
reasoning tests given in Chapter 14 would make good tests of 
general intelligence? 
A boy of 10 with an 1.Q. of 140 would have what mental age? 
A boy of 14 with an 1.Q. of 100? In what respects would these 
two boys resemble each other or an adult with an M.A. of 14? 
In what respects would the three be very unlike? 
If you were selecting children to form a homogeneous grade, 
what measure would you use, the M.A. or the 1.Q.? Why? 
What arguments or evidence can you offer to support the con- 
tention that intelligence tests measure the results of school 
training mainly? How might the facts be determined experi- 
mentally? 
Carefully distinguish between intellectual capacity and achieve- 
ment. 
Do you suppose the methods of teaching which are best for 
1.Q.’s of 180 and over are best for those of 100? For those of 
70? 
Comment on this statement, “It may be of greater value to 
society to discover a single gifted child and aid in his proper 
development than to train a thousand dullards to the limit of 
their educability.” 
How would you explain the fact that children of superior intelli- 
gence when graded with those of the same age occasionally 
become mischievous, lazy or bored with school work? Does the 
occasional report of an eminent man getting along badly in 
school, if true, necessarily prove that such men were stupid 
when young or that they were unable to do school work? 
If children were to be grouped according to Mental Age, what 
difficulties of administration would be encountered? What, if 
any, difficulties in social adjustments? 
Have you observed any cases of irregular educational develop- 
ment, of spurts or arrests, or of changes in apparent brightness? 
Might these irregularities be only apparent? Might they 
appear in scholastic achievement without being occasioned by 
similar variations in mental development? 
Is it your experience that the more intelligent people are more 
or less socially adaptable? How would you explain the excep- 
tional cases?

  CHAPTER XIX 
THE MEASUREMENT, ORGANIZATION AND SIG- 
NIFICANCE OF VARIOUS HUMAN TRAITS 
In the preceding chapter, we considered the means of 
measuring and the significance of individual differences in 
a complex native trait, general intelligence. Intelligence, 
it was found, exerts an influence on achievement in scho- 
lastic subjects, vocational success, social and moral adap- 
tation. The correlations were never perfect and some- 
times only moderate or low. While imperfections in the 
tests and inequalities in opportunity to learn are in some 
measure responsible for the appearance of imperfect cor- 
respondence between intelligence and attainment, it is 
probable that, to account fully for achievement in par- 
ticular tasks or adaptation socially and morally, traits 
other than general mental ability must be taken into 
account. The human personality is broader than intel- 
ligence; perfect adjustment to the demands of life de- 
pends on aptitudes of other types, and.to many of these 
the science of human measurement has recently been 
devoting active attention. In this chapter, we shall con- 
sider briefly some of the facts concerning the identifica- 
tion, measurement and organization of various human 
traits.

el as to his vocational fitness, an adult contemplating a 
hange in vocation, or troubled with unusual fears or 
uilty of misdemeanor, the examiner is interested, among . 
ther things, in the individual’s attainments. Precisely 
hat abilities has the person acquired; what can he do; 
hat does he know? The need of objective tests is here 
uite as imperative as in appraising other human traits.

mates of aptitude for selling clothes, or of trustworthi- 
ess and sociability were disclosed and from experi- 
mental studies it appears that subjective evaluations of 
lability, scholastic, social or vocational, are similarly inex- 
act. For example, in one experiment a final examination 
in geometry was graded by 114 teachers of that subject 
lon a percentage basis, with results as shown graphically 
in Figure 68. The scores range from 28 to 92. Similar 
results have been obtained in other subjects. That these 
variations are not due mainly to differences in the stand- 
ards of different schools is indicated by studies of teach- 
ers in the same schools and colleges. The variations 
Ihave been nearly as great. Even when the same teacher 
lafter an interval regraded a set of papers, the marks 
differed appreciably from those on the first scoring. Such 
 
-P-A-G-E-574
556 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
inadequacies in appraising ability by judging product: 
are duplicated by errors in judgments of performance 
directly observed. The need of standardization of con 
ditions and objective evaluation is clearly great. 
Standardized Tests and Scales.—The requirements fo’ 
objective measurement embrace two devices, a stand 
ardized test and a scale. Any series of questions, exer: 
cises, problems, or performances constitutes a test. Whe 
the procedure for conducting the test, the instructions 
time, and methods of scoring results are prescribed, w 
have a standardized test. For many standardized test 
now in use, scales have been constructed by means o 
which the results of the test may be evaluated. A scal 
is a series of test scores ranging from lowest to highes 
by steps of known, usually equal, magnitude or a repre 
sentation of a series of products which range from vei 
poor to excellent by steps of known or equal magnitude 
The scale may be in terms of difficulty, range, speed o' 
quality, or some combination of these. A few illustra 
tions will make this clear. 
Difficulty Scales.—A difficulty scale is developed by 
trying out on a number of persons a series of problems or 
tasks and ascertaining the number who succeed in each. 
The fewer the persons who succeed, the harder the prob- 
lem must be. With the difficulty of the tasks thus deter- 
mined, they are arranged in order from the easiest to 
hardest. The examinee then begins at the easy end of 
the scale and progresses as far as he can in the time al- 
lowed, which is usually liberal. This will be recognized 
as the principle of the Binet Intelligence Scale. Among 
scales of this type are several for scholastic attainments. 
There are scales for reading comprehension which seek to 
determine how difficult a passage the subject can under- 
stand; others for attainment in arithmetic, algebra, and

reometry, which seek to disclose how difficult a problem 
ye can solve, and others of the same character in word 
nowledge, history, grammar, spelling, etc. Some of 
he Trade Tests, constructed by psychologists for deter- 
nining vocational competence of soldiers before assign- 
nent to duty in the American army during the late war, 
vere difficulty tests. Similar tests and scales are now 
ised in many industries. 
Range Scales.—The range of information and ability 
lisclosed by a test may be scaled in the same manner as 
he difficulty, the number of correct answers given or 
asks done out of the total number, more or less equal in 
lifficulty, forms the basis of the scale. In the range test, 
he time allowance is liberal or unlimited. The range of 
nformation or ability is often of considerable concern to 
in employer in appraising fitness for some position. This 
‘orm of test was prominent in the Army Trade Test 
eries and is used widely in industries. 
Speed Scales.—The speed scale is designed to measure 
che amount of work of a uniform quality and difficulty 
hat a subject can do in a prescribed time. The number 
f words per minute written by hand, typed, set up on 
line-o-type, transmitted or received in telegraphy, 
ecorded or transcribed in shorthand; the number of 
ricks laid, square feet painted, papered, spaded, etc., 
re all samples of speed tests. The scale is a standard 
eries with which to compare results of the test. 
Quality Scales.—The quality scale (a sample and the 
ethod of derivation of which was described on pages 
97-399) consists of a series of sample products of writ-

The value of the scale is that it provides a standard of

aminer’s estimates may be improved and expressed ir 
terms of a uniform currency. This type of scale was als 
utilized in the U.S. Army Trade Tests.

ults of experience. There is considerable evidence, how- 
ver, that these are not the sole causes of such variations 
in an individual’s proficiency profile, but that the varia-

special aptitude or inaptitude for learning—along specific 
lines. 
The evidence in favor of this belief in specialized 
capacity is much the same as that which suggests the in- 
heritance of general mental ability. Special aptitudes for 
composition, typing, mathematics, debating, handwork 
and the like appear when environment and training have 
been uniformly good or bad; special inaptitude is often 
found which persists despite unusual effort, instruction 
and encouragement. Finally, special abilities and inabili- 
ties often run in families as the studies of the inheritance 
of individuals eminent in music, painting, mathematics 
and science or possessing special deficiencies in these and 
other functions have shown. 
Tests for Special Aptitudes or Capacities.—Since each 
individual, then, possesses to some extent special apti- 
tudes and inaptitudes for developing ability, specialists 
in the field af measurement have endeavored to construct 
objective tests for special capacities of many sorts. These 
tests for special aptitudes may be classified by location 
on a scale which extends from tests at the one extreme 
which may be called analytic tests, to the other extreme, 
at which are the symptomatic performance tests. 
Analytic Tests of Aptitude.—An excellent example of 
the analytic tests are the Seashore Tests for Musical 
Aptitude. Like other tests of this type, the Seashore 
series is an aggregate of particular tests for the many 
particular abilities which have been found, in experi- 
mental and analytic studies, to be involved in musical 
ability. In brief outline the tests are: 
I. Tests of Musical Sensitivity

2. Sense of intensity

IV. Tests of musical intellect. 
1. Musical free association 
2. Musical power of reflection 
V. Tests of musical feeling 
1. Musical taste 
2. Emotional. reaction to music 
8. Emotional self-expression in music. 
Since all of these abilities are involved in music, it 
follows that aptitude for music is not to be conceived as a 
unit trait or a single and simple capacity. On the con- 
trary it is an aggregate of many. Excellence in one, 
coupled with deficiencies in others, would not suffice for 
achievement. Some single deficiencies such as the 
capacity to discriminate pitch within certain limits—a 
capacity that is usually native and unimprovable—would, 
on the other hand, make progress impossible however 
optimum the capacities in other respects. The apt indi- 
vidual is the one who approaches an optimum degree of
-P-A-G-E-581
  MEASUREMENT OF HUMAN TRAITS 563 
native endowment in all. A final appraisement of musical 
aptitude would, consequently, be based on a consideration 
of many constituent capacities, each weighted in accord- 
ance with its importance. 
It is probable that all aptitudes such as those for driv- 
ing automobiles, writing verse, pole vaulting, selling 
clothes or doing other complex tasks, are also based on 
composites of many particular capacities, each necessarily 
present in a certain degree. Above the minimum degree 
essential, further increments may add to the possibilities 
of achievement until an optimum amount is reached. 
Possession of that capacity in greater amounts may be 
of no value; indeed it might be a disadvantage. Thus it 
as been found that too much as well as too little intelli- 
ence, as compared to a certain optimum range, makes 
fficiency in certain industrial jobs less likely. <A 
hilosopher might fail as a barber as completely as the 
mbecile; one may be too swift as well as too slow to 
andle certain machines with efficiency, too talkative as 
ell as too taciturn to be a good salesman. 
Symptomatic Performance Tests.—At the other ex- 
reme from tests which are designed to measure in relative 
solation the many capacities which analysis of the func- 
ion discloses, are the tests for convenience called sympto- 
atic performance tests. Such tests are usually few 
ather than many, and may be of any type whatsoever, 
he only requirement being that achievement in them is 
ymptomatic of aptitude for the ability in question. 
ften the test includes in one performance a number of 
bilities that are correlated with the aptitude. An ex- 
mple of such a test is the Stenquist Test for Mechanical 
ptitude which was used widely on soldiers during the 
ar and has been, before and since, used in schools and 
ndustries.     
       
    
    
   
    
   
    
    
-P-A-G-E-582
564 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
The Stenquist Test includes two parts. The Assembly 
Test consists of a series of mechanical objects taken apart 
—a bicycle bell, a paper-clip, a lock, a mousetrap, ete.— 
which the examinee is to assemble as correctly and rap- 
idly as possible. Both speed and accuracy are scored. 
The other part consists of a series of pictures of mechani- 
cal devices, blocks and tackles, gear assemblies, etc., the 
functions and relations of which are to be indicated by 
letters and other marks. 
Such tests are not based on exhaustive analyses of the 
capacities involved in mechanical work, nor is it likely 
that all mechanical capacities are tested. The justifica- 
tion of the test for purposes of indicating mechanical 
aptitude is based solely on the degree to which the results 
are symptoms of aptitude or inaptitude. They are symp- 
tomatic of capacity in much the same way that change in 
blood pressure, pulse and temperature are symptomatic 
of prospects of good or poor health or of the presence or 
absence of a particular physical disease. 
Tests for aptitudes in stenography, salesmanship, ac- 
counting, drawing, writing, reading, engineering, and 
various particular industrial tasks lie at various points 
between the extremes. Most of them embrace features 
of both, that is, particular tests of operations identified as 
entering into the work and others that are not clearly 
tests of a specific ability, but of functions that have 
proved to be symptomatic of ability. The tests for apti- 
tude in aviation during the war included both. 
The range of special aptitudes is broader than indus- 
trial, vocational, scholastic and aesthetic activities; it 
includes the social, moral, religious and other phases of 
life. Undoubtedly some are born with better equipment 
than others for understanding, liking, getting along with 
or managing other people, for perceiving, resisting an 
 
-P-A-G-E-583
  MEASUREMENT OF HUMAN TRAITS 565 
ombating moral temptations, for appreciating, accepting 
nd living by religious standards. In these fields objec- 
ive means of appraising native strengths and weaknesses 
in particular forms are not as yet numerous or refined. 
ome approaches to the measurement of aptitudes and 
bilities that are perhaps involved in adjustments in these 
phases of life will be mentioned presently. 
Main Conclusions from Studies with Tests of Special 
Aptitudes.—Out of the numerous studies of special 
talents and attainments has developed the concept of 
specialized aptitude. Like general intelligence, a special 
aptitude is conceived to be native, to indicate the possi- 
bility or capacity for development along a particular line. 
As in general intelligence, individuals differ in special © 
capacities approximately as portrayed by the probability 
surface. A special aptitude is not, however, a single, 
isolated functional unit but merely an aggregate of more 
minute capacities. In each and every vocational, social 
lor scholastic task, a number of minute capacities are in- 
volved. For one task, such as reading, a certain aggregate 
is utilized; for another, such as playing the piano, another 
group, and so on. Between any two combinations there 
may be an overlapping, great or small. In the develop- 
ment of measuring instruments, attention has been given 
both to the narrow capacities and abilities and to the 
broader aggregates, or special aptitudes and abilities.   THe MeasurEMENT OF EmorionaL , TEMPERAMENTAL 
AND OTHER TRAITS OF THE PERSONALITY. 
Achievement in a particular task, then, depends largely 
upon native capacity for that particular function. But 
given equal capacities, equal general mental ability, equal 
opportunity, instruction and encouragement, differences
-P-A-G-E-584
  566 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
in achievement still appear. How are these remaining 
discrepancies to be explained? 
In part, they may be explained by differences in tem- 
perament, which is in considerable measure the resultant 
of activities of the endocrine glands; by differences in 
general emotionality and general nervous stability; by 
differences in the strengths of the fundamental urges; by 
differences in habituated forms of mental adjustments 
such as day-dreaming or active compensation. The dif- 
ferences in achievement in whatever line depend in some 
measure on traits of personality that are not included as 
specific items in the aggregate of special capacities which 
together are spoken of as aptitude for acquisition of 
* music, selling ability, oratorical ability, and so on. The 
importance of temperamental and other dynamic traits 
has been already emphasized; only a few words concern- 
ing efforts to measure them need be added. 
Measurement of Strengths of the Dominant Urges. — 
Each of the dominant urges discussed in Chapter VIII 
offers a clue to the study of traits of the personality which 
may influence achievement in any line as well as adjust- 
ment generally. Some individuals are more pugnacious 
than others; some more obstinate, masterful, or self- 
assertive; some are more acquisitive, curious, kindly, 
gregarious, or more prone to laughter, to crying, or to 
fear; some have stronger sex and parental propensities; 
some are more zealous to secure social approval; some are 
more responsive to rivalry. All told, these fundamental 
dispositions constitute an important stock of dynamic 
factors. That the task of measuring these traits of per- 
sonality is not as yet far advanced is substantial evidence 
not of indifference but of the complexity and difficulty of 
the tasks involved. 
For several traits, such as aggressiveness or self-asser- 
 
-P-A-G-E-585
  MEASUREMENT OF HUMAN TRAITS _ 567 
tion, perseverance, optimism, stubbornness, and flexibility 
in adjustment and ambition, tests have been devised and 
are now being subjected to trial. Among the most in- 
genious and most promising is the Will-Temperament 
Test devised by Downey, which includes twelve specific 
tests, based mainly on handwriting, for such traits as the 
following: 
1. Speed of movement (whether a person naturally 
moves quickly or slowly). 
2. Freedom from load (the tendency to warm up 
rapidly and work at high speed without external 
pressure). 
8. Flexibility (ease and effectiveness in readjustment 
or adaptability). 
4, Speed of decision. 
5. Motor impulsion (impetuosity and energy of re- 
action). 
6. Reaction to contradiction (the degree of confidence 
with which one maintains his opinion against 
contradiction). 
7. Resistance to opposition (the tendency to overcome 
obstruction). 
8. Finality of judgment (whether one wavers or 
perseveres in his opinions). 
9. Motor inhibition (a test of “motor control, imper- 
turbability, and patience’). ‘ 
10. Interest in detail. 
11. Coérdination of impulses (“capacity to handle a 
12. complex situation successfully without forgetting 
any of the factors involved’). 
Volitional perseveration (‘willingness to keep 
plugging away”). 
Downey’s method is to use the scores for each test 
independently, displaying them for purposes of compari-

and suggestibility which increase X’s social assets, but are of du- 
bious value in his business life. The low score on interest in de- 
tail is not a serious defect, since X is in a position to turn over to 
subordinates the execution of many of his projects. It goes, how- 
ever, with a tendency to generalize on insufficient grounds. The low 
score on volitional perseveration is probably a real weakness.”

than a profile ranging from 8 to 10. High scores on such 
traits as speed of movement and decision, freedom from 
load, flexibility, and motor impulsion are said to charac- 
terize an individual as mobile or rapid-fire in organiza- 
tion, whereas high scores in motor inhibition, interest in 
detail, codrdination of impulses and volitional persevera- 
tion are characteristic of the controlled, deliberate, 
painstaking person. Many combinations are possible 
among the twelve tests but they are not so numerous as 
to exaggerate the multiplicity of temperaments found in 
human nature. 
How faithfully the Will-Temperament Tests represent 
the traits they purport to measure has not as yet been 
determined with finality, but the tests have opened a 
fruitful field for research. 
Measurement of General Emotionality, Nervous and 
| Mental Stability——General emotionality and: instability 
of nervous and mental types may be subdivided into sev- 
eral varieties by expert diagnosis although even among 
specialists classification is by no means uniform. Diag- 
nosis is based upon symptoms, present and past, reported 
by the subject or upon observation of behavior or both. 
Each specialist places varying emphasis on certain symp- 
toms; some of which given great weight by one are con- 
sidered as of little significance or disregarded by others. 
During the war, an inventory of the symptoms utilized 
by many leading specialists was made and organized into 
a questionnaire by Woodworth. Used during the war in 
the study of psychoneurotic and emotional soldiers and 
since upon laymen, it has provided material for the ap- 
praisement of the significance of symptoms which were 
previously of unknown value. In the original form, the 
Woodworth Psychoneurotic Questionnaire included 116 
items. The following are samples:

   and from sad to happy without reason?.......... Yes No 
108. Have you ever been afraid of going insane?...... Yes No 
114. Can you stand the sight of blood?..............- Yes No 
The average number of symptoms or positive responses 
out of the possible 116 was, for white recruits in general, 
10; for college students, 10; for the psychoneurotic 
soldiers encountered during recruiting, from 30 to 40. 
For a preliminary appraisement of general instability the 
test has proved useful and further work may make more 
differential diagnosis possible. 
Association Tests of Temperamental and Character 
Traits.—Among the devices for appraising various emo- 
tional, temperamental and other character traits, asso- 
ciation tests were early suggested. They fall into two 
types, the free and controlled association tests. In using 
the free association method, the examiner presents the 
subject with a stimulus word selected to initiate a flow 
of associated ideas in some phase of experience. The 
subject is expected to permit his thoughts to rove freely 
and to report what occurs to him. Ideas thus aroused by 
such words as money, business, marriage, enemies, fears, 
family, may furnish the experienced examiner with clues 
as to the subject’s difficulties or “complexes” and his type 
of thinking, whether pessimistic or optimistic, extra-
-P-A-G-E-589
  MEASUREMENT OF HUMAN TRAITS 571 
vertive (i.e., impersonal and objective) or introvertive, 
or whether systematic or scattering. Recently, tests in 
which the associated responses are more thoroughly con- 
trolled and comparable with standards have found 
greater favor. Two lists of 100 words each have been 
given, a word at a time, to a large number of adults 
(Kent and Rosanoff) and to children (Woodrow and 
Lowell) respectively, and the results recorded. For each 
word is thus available a table of frequencies of responses. 
Peculiar and symptomatic associations are more readily 
distinguished from the normal. Numerous other varie- 
ties of controlled association tests are at present under- 
going study. Thus far, the association method has been 
of demonstrable value only when utilized by experts for 
certain limited purposes, mainly to make a preliminary 
survey of the mental or temperamental predispositions 
of patients, abnormal or suspected of being abnormal. 
Summary.—These are samples of various devices and 
evidences of active efforts being made to disentangle and 
objectively measure the innumerable aspects of the 
dynamic personality. Although certain forms of attack, 
such as by use of association tests in some form, are by 
no means recent, the validity of most tests of these com- 
plex traits of personality has not been determined with 
precision. At least, progress is being made. As the 
validity of the objective tests are demonstrated, the réle 
of the emotional, temperamental and volitional aspects 
of the personality in modifying achievement and influ- 
encing adjustments to life generally will be more perfectly 
determined. 
Prrsonauity “Typss.” 
It is usual in the study of traits of personality to be- 
come interested in “types,” and to attempt to classify all
-P-A-G-E-590
572 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
individuals into one or more such types. The traditional 
types, the sanguine, or animated and cheerful; the melan- 
cholic or depressed; the choleric or quick, high strung, 
easily provoked; and the phlegmatic or slow and calm, are 
often preserved under new names and frequently other 
varieties added, but a disposition has remained to reduce 
all to a relatively small number of types. By this proce- 
dure, two errors are likely to be encountered. The first 
is the erroneous notion that individuals fall into several 
rather discrete groups, each group characterized by one 
or another trait, that individuals tend to be at one or an- 
other extreme. This is quite untrue; in sanguineness or 
any other such characteristic, individuals vary continu- 
ously from one extreme to the other, with the largest 
number clustered midway. In all these traits, in other 
words, individuals are distributed more nearly in accord- 
ance with the normal curve than in accordance with a 
curve thinly populated in the middle as compared to the 
extremes. Most individuals are neither conspicuously 
irascible or calm, buoyant or depressed, self-assertive or 
submissive, introvertive or extravertive, but nearer the 
average than these extremes. The extremes, then, are 
not “types” in the sense of being the most typical of the 
whole group. On the contrary they are numerically least 
typical. The most representative individual is the 
average. 
The second erroneous suggestion arising from classifica- 
tion into a small number of types is that the personality 
consists of but relatively few characteristics. This is 
quite incorrect; the list of human traits is long, and the 
permutations and combinations of varying amounts found 
in particular individuals are almost innumerable. What 
traits constitute a person—so far as his general adjust- 
ments and activities in the everyday give-and-take rela-
-P-A-G-E-591
  MEASUREMENT OF HUMAN TRAITS 573 
tions are concerned—has been disclosed in some measure; 
but heretofore many traits have been considered in isola- 
tion from others. Other things being equal, a high degree 
of intelligence is more productive when found in a healthy 
body. A powerful voice alone will not make a successful 
statesman, nor will a fine physique. The race is not 
always won by the merely swift. For many forms of 
adjustment and achievement a certain combination of 
traits is required. 
The varieties of combinations of traits which are found 
in individuals are too numerous to make feasible even 
a rough grouping. We shall consider merely two out- 
standing and easily identifiable groupings in order to 
disclose certain pertinent facts. 
Sex DIFFERENCES. 
If an attempt were made to divide the human race 
into types of personalities, no grouping could be more 
obvious and, if popular opinion were reliable, no groups 
more conspicuously different than male and female. In 
fiction and in pseudo-scientific literature, sex differences 
are described in number and degree so great as to make 
man and woman appear to be members of nearly distinet 
species. This is doubtless due in part to a tendency to 
compare extreme cases of the two groups. It may be said 
at the outset that while sex differences do exist, they are 
less great on the whole than has generally been supposed. 
Before considering male and female personalities as a 
whole, it will be necessary to consider the differences in 
specific traits. In gross physical traits—height, contour, 
weight, strength, and appearance—sex differences are 
most spectacular, a fact which doubtless has had an 
influence on the judgments of mental and temperamental 
 
-P-A-G-E-592
  574 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
traits. But even in physical traits, the overlapping of 
boys and girls of the same age, or of men and women, 
is considerable. 
In general intelligence sex differences are less con- 
spicuous than physical differences at all stages of growth, 
as is shown in the following table based on the Binet 
Mental Ages of 1000 children measured by Terman and 
3500 measured by Burt.

  Both investigations agree that the girls surpass the 
boys on the average by about three-tenths of a year in 
mental age, but the superiority is irregularly distributed. 
It has been customary to see in these figures a more rapid 
mental maturation of girls to harmonize with their more 
precocious physical development, but even if this inter- 
pretation is correct—it is not altogether certain that it is 
—the significant matter is the closeness of the approxima- 
tion of the two sexes to equality. As adults they are 
equal. 
In more specific mental abilities—perception, memory, 
reason, etc.—the difference between the sexes, where they 
exist at all, are so slight and unobtrusive as to be swamped

spelling, composition, writing, drawing, and handwork, 
Burt has measured over 5000 school children in 19 dif- 
‘erent schools, yielding for each age approximately 750 
epresentatives of each sex. The facts are given in the 
wccompanying table which displays the relative attain- 
ments of each. On the whole, the differences are essen- 
ially negligible. Girls excel slightly in reading, spelling, 
writing, and composition; boys in arithmetic and hand- 
vork; in drawing the sexes are equal. How insignificant 
re the differences in general is disclosed by the data for 
rithmetic. In addition girls are slightly superior, in 
ubtraction boys excel, in multiplication attainments are 
qual, and in division boys excel slightly. All through the 
ist, the sexes play a veritable leap-frog with each other

and even in handwork the differences are so small as t« 
be statistically unreliable. On the whole, with equa. 
incentives there is little justification for the assumptior 
of sex differences in capacities for achievement in schoo 
functions. 
Concerning sex differences in emotional, tempera: 
mental, moral, and other traits innumerable opinion: 
have been given; but for none is there unquestionable 
evidence. Indeed, as more precise measurement becomes 
possible the verdict of “no significant difference” is most 
frequently cast, although it may be that in the traits as 
yet unmeasured important differences will be disclosed 
The most probable differences are certain attitudes anc 
emotional propensities clustering around the differences 
in the reproductive functions on the one hand, and the 
differences in physical powers on the other. It is believec 
by some, but not proved, that the maternal urges differ 
in strength and in operation from the paternal, resultin 
for the woman in a keener interest, broader sympathies 
and perhaps clearer insight in dealing with human ex 
pressions and acts. Men may be more self-assertive an 
pugnacious, in keeping with their superior physica! 
strength. 
Differences in general achievement and _personalit: 
between the sexes, then, in so far as environmental influ 
ences affect them equally, are doubtless exaggerated b 
the tendency to compare the extremes rather than thi 
typical cases. The general differences which do obtain ar 
to be explained not so much by differences in all singl 
traits as by the influence of a few which color the whol 
Thus, if the parental urges are stronger in women, it ma: 
affect widely their activities in and relations to life. Th 
superior physical strength of men—and if genuine, th 
greater force of the pugnacious urges—would account i
-P-A-G-E-595
  MEASUREMENT OF HUMAN TRAITS 577 
bart for their greater achievements, even if the mental 
ind motor aptitudes of the sexes were equal. 
Ractau DIFFERENCES. 
Another opportunity to study combinations of traits is 
rovided by the existence of different races. Indeed, it is 
nd always has been customary to believe that each race 
has its peculiarly individual personality; that the French- 
nan, Englishman, German or Swede is innately organized 
n a characteristic way; in a pattern that cannot be wholly 
earranged by environment or training. 
Among civilized races differences in physical traits are 
emonstrated; differences in temperamental traits are 
robable, but not demonstrated; and differences in men- 
ality are neither demonstrated nor probable. Extensive 
neasures by various forms of the Binet test in France, 
ermany, Sweden, England, and America, and less ex- 
ensive investigation in other countries, show inconspicu- 
us variations in general outcome. The probability is 
hat the general mental ability of these races is approxi- 
nately equal. In America, little has been learned of 
acial differences, except that on such tests as the Army 
Ipha, Negroes and Indians perform relatively poorly; 
ut any sweeping statement of the intellectual status of 
hese races would be premature. Among other races in 
.merica, in so far as traits have been measured, the over- 
upping is very great, both in physical and mental char- 
cteristics. Concerning emotional and temperamental 
raits, there is little to offer except conjecture. It is quite 
kely, however, that the tendency to seize upon some one 
r few peculiarities of a race, magnify them, and judge 
he whole personality in the light of them, results in an 
xaggeration of the differences between races as a whole.

578 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
Tuer CorRELATION OF TRAITS. 
Our final problem is concerned with the character 
the organization of different traits among individuals 
the same sex and race. In the typical individual, wh 
does superiority or inferiority in one trait imply concer 
ing other traits? Does superiority in one respect indica 
nothing at all concerning other characteristics, or does 
imply inferiority or superiority in other traits? Sue 
questions are answered by measuring a group of indi 
viduals and computing the coefficients of correlatio 
which express the average or typical association of an 
one trait with another. If the correlation is zero, th 
one implies nothing concerning the other; if it is positiv 
it indicates that the two tend, in degree indicated by th 
magnitude of the coefficient, to go together—a_higt 
average, or low status in one implying a high, average o 
low status in the other; if the correlation is negative 
superiority in one implies inferiority in the other or vic 
versa. 
Studies of the correlations of human traits early dis 
closed the fallacy of the prevalent belief in compensatio 
—the assumption that the possession of certain desirabl 
traits implied the presence of compensating undesirabl 
characteristics. To illustrate: it was frequently asserte 
that the quick learners retain poorly, that the rapid work 
ers were inaccurate, that great knowledge went with sloy 
wit, that men of great artistic abilities—as in musi 
painting or literary composition—were usually stupid 1 
practical matters, that scholarly minds were encased i 
clumsy bodies, that superior intellects were usuall 
coupled with inferior mental stability. To the extent tha 
various desirable traits have been measured, the fact 
generally favor the theory of positive correlation rathe  
-P-A-G-E-597
  MEASUREMENT OF HUMAN TRAITS 579 
than that of negative correlation or compensation. If the 
reader will glance at the various tables of correlations in 
this book, he will find positive correlations almost ex- 
clusively. A few others will be briefly mentioned, taking 
as samples the correlations of various desirable traits with 
general mental ability. 
Superiority in mental capacities is correlated positively 
but not closely with desirable physical traits. If we take

a large group of individuals of the same age and divide 
them into two groups on the basis of mental ability, the 
brighter group will have fewer defects of the sense organs, 
nervous system, reacting mechanisms, and internal organs. 
There will be many exceptions to the general rule among 
individuals inasmuch as the correlations are usually low. 
A similar relation between mental ability and physiologi- . 
cal efficiency will be found. The indications are that the 
group superior in mentality will surpass the other in re-  
-P-A-G-E-598
580 ELEMENTARY PSYCHOLOGY 
sistance to disease, to drugs such as alcohol, to malnutri- 
tion, to exposure, ete. 
The correlations of general mental ability with the 
broader volitional, emotional, esthetic, social, and tem- 
peramental traits are less well known chiefly because 
these traits have not as yet yielded to precise measure- 
ments. The list of correlations in the table on the pre- 
ceding page, however, suggests a decided tendency toward 
positive correlation. : 
General mental ability, then, is positively associated 
more or less with other desirable traits. If the problem 
had been taken up from another point of view, such as 
the correlations of other traits with morality or artistic 
ability, the same general result would have been found, 
namely, all desirable traits tend to be associated with each 
other. The correlations are not equal, however, and they 
are often low. Even a correlation as high as + 0.90 
permits several individuals fairly high in one trait to be 
fairly low in the other, and vice versa. Specialization 
there is; we all have our particular strengths and weak- 
nesses. But on the average, weakness in one trait implies 
weakness in others; mediocrity in one implies mediocrity 
in others, and strength in one, strength in others.

advantages, if any? (For a report of the use of such tests in 
courses in psychology see an article by A. I. Gates in the Journal 
of Educational Psychology, May, 1921.) 
What are some of the uses to which the Stenquist tests of 
mechanical aptitude could be put in industry and in school? 
Do you recall evidence presented in the book which would indi- 
cate the desirability of supplementing or supplanting the judg- 
ment of the employment manager by objective tests of ability? 
As used in the army what were such tests termed? 
What do people usually mean when they speak of a “womanly 
woman,” “a manly man,” “a true Irishman,” “a typical French- 
man?” Do you know any such individuals? Are they typical 
or exceptional? ; 
Why do we have less accurate measures for such traits as dili- 
gence, ambition, etc., than we have for intelligence? Are these 
traits more complex, intrinsically more difficult to measure, less 
important in life, or are there other causes? Draw up a list of 
possible explanations. 
Have women accomplished as much as men in the fields of art, 
literature, or science? How do you account for any discrep- 
ancies found? . What biological and environmental as well as 
psychological factors might be important? 
Which will usually tell you most about an individual’s mental 
equipment, a knowledge of his race or a knowledge of the traits 
of his parents? 
Draw a curve of distribution which will show how we distort 
the facts when we assume that individuals are divided into 
types. 
What traits, other than those mentioned in the text, do you 
think may contribute to success in school work or life? What 
ones to desirable moral adjustments? To musical ability? To 
dramatic ability? To executive ability? 
Among your acquaintances, do desirable traits seem to go to- 
gether? Try this out by rating them in several traits such as 
intelligence, personal appearance, health, popularity, and trust- 
worthiness and compare the results with the distributions shown 
at the end of Chapter XVII. Is the correlation positive or nega- 
tive? f

PREFACE 
Tue addresses and papers collected in this volume 
were written for special occasions and delivered to 
various audiences during a period of more than 
twenty years. They all however bear upon one 
general theme, science teaching, and indicate a con- 
sistent trend of thought. In a measure, they con- 
stitute the history of a movement in education. 
The title of the book requires a word of explana- 
tion. The addresses were, for the most part, de- 
livered to teachers of physics and chemistry. Why 
then should not the title be The Teaching of Phys- 
ical Science? Although the illustrations were of 
necessity chosen mostly from physical science, the 
addresses were a constant appeal to all science 
teachers to teach science rather than special sciences. 
The addresses are arranged in chronological 
rather than logical order. Although the same theme 
is often repeated, the treatment is progressive as 
befits the history of the growth of certain ideas 
among teachers.

THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
I 
THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF 
NATURAL SCIENCE ? 
In this paper I have undertaken only to state the 
case; the limits of space will not permit the presen- 
tation of arguments to defend it. It will be under- 
stood that I have not attempted to state the value 
of science as it is now taught in the schools, but rather 
as it might be taught. In mentioning values I have 
omitted several considerations, such, for example, as 
the giving of useful information, and dwelt rather 
upon what seems to me to be the chief value of the 
study of science, viz., the training in certain habits 
which may be characterized as scientific. 
Through the study of science the habit of investi- 
gation is acquired. As soon as one begins to explore 
by the methods of natural science — and a pupil in 
the primary school is not too young to begin — he 
feels a strong impulse to investigate further. He 
finds that his field of knowledge has been extremely 
small, and that he has been entertaining fantastic 
ideas concerning that which lies outside of his little 
1Paper read before the Harvard Teachers’ Association, March 9, 
1895.

circle. Very many of his ideas break down when he 
begins to investigate, and correct ideas must be 
established in their place. Children are generally 
eager to investigate, but a notion has long prevailed 
that if they become wise through their own explora- 
tions they are not so likely to be good. As a result 
of this it has happened that nature’s feasts have been 
spread in vain, while we have with one accord made 
it our excuse that we think it safer to take our knowl- 
edge only at second hand. Some one has said, “In 
this world a large part of the business of the wise is 
to counteract the efforts of the good.” It is the un- 
doubted mission of science to enable the good to 
become the wise. Dr. Josiah Strong in the New Era 
says: 
“Generation after generation has repeated the mistakes of its 
predecessors at a dreadful cost of suffering and loss, which was 
as needless as it would be for ships, in clear weather, to split on 
rocks known to sailors for centuries.” 
Professor Brinton says: 
“The good which we endeavor to attain is scientific truth, 
the one test of which is that it will bear untrammeled and 
unlimited investigation. Scientific truth is absolutely open 
to the world; it is as free as air, as visible as light, there is no 
such thing about it as an inner secret, a mysterious gnosis, 
shared by the favored few, the select illuminati, concealed 
from the vulgar horde or masked to them under ambiguous 
terms. Wherever you find mystery, concealment, occultism, 
you may be sure that the spirit of science does not dwell, 
and what is more, that it would be an unwelcomed intruder. 
Such pretensions belong to pseudo-science, to science falsely so 
called, shutting itself out of the light, because it is afraid of the 
light.”
-P-A-G-E-19
  EDUCATIONAL VALUE 3 
The scientific mind investigates for the sole purpose 
of finding out the truth, and to the truth all precon- 
ceived ideas are subordinated. “It does not assume to 
know what ought to be, but finds out whatis. On this 
line all the victories of modern science have been won.” 
Through the study of science the habit of observ- 
ing relations is acquired. Persons may have the 
habit of observing to the minutest details things in 
which they are interested, without practicing scien- 
tific observation. Scientific observation is always 
organized observation. It relates one thing to an- 
other, lighting up one fact by another, searching for 
the relation of cause and effect. The unscientific 
mind is insensible to the lessons which its observa- 
tions and experiences would teach. I have dis- 
covered a large number of persons, old and young, 
who have not learned the lesson that when they 
look into a mirror obliquely they see objects not 
from their own immediate vicinity, but those situ- 
ated upon the opposite side of a perpendicular to 
the surface of the mirror. I have also discovered 
that it is possible for persons to have much learning 
and still be oblivious to such an obvious fact. . Pro- 
fessor Wesley Mills says: 
“T have known children who did not go to school till seven 
years of age, who prior to that period had learned to be good 
observers of what was going on around them, to lose all love for 
natural objects after being at school a couple of years; and I 
do also know to my sorrow that many of the young men that 
enter our colleges neither know how nor care to observe. They 
prefer not to look nature directly in the face, but try to see her 
through the medium of books, lectures, etc., and for this our 
school system is largely responsible.”
-P-A-G-E-20
  4 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
A college graduate and a candidate for the degree 
of Ph.D. was asked what evidence he had that air 
makes a fire burn, and he made a pitiable spectacle 
trying to recall what the authorities said upon the 
subject. A boy of twelve when asked the same 
question said: 
“We close the stove draughts to shut out the air when we wish 
to check the fire, and with a bellows we blow in more air when 
we wish to quicken the fire.” 
The Popular Science Monthly in an editorial says : 
“Tf there is a fact that experience has overwhelmingly illus- 
trated and established, it is that mere book-teaching of science 
is void and of none effect, nay that it is worse; that it has an 
actively injurious effect on the mind, which it deadens with mean- 
ingless jargon and befogs with ill-comprehended notions. How 
hollow, and often how fantastically absurd, are the ideas chil- 
dren acquire of things of which they are told but which they 
have never seen or handled. Let us turn children out of the 
public schools ignorant, if need be, of many things that are 
taught to them now, but let this idea at least be rooted in their 
minds, that this world is made up of real things; and this 
further idea, that words are worse than useless unless they can 
be applied in the most definite manner to well-understood 
objects of sense or of thought. What a blessing it would be if 
we could inspire the rising generation with a real horror of vague 
and meaningless language. It would mean nothing less than an 
intellectual revolution in the world.” 
Scientific observation means seeing with one’s eyes 
and having, as a result, a train of thoughts start in 
one’s own brain. Professor Tyndall said that 
“Faraday never could work from the experiments of others, 
however clearly described. He knew well that from every ex- 
periment issues a radiation, luminous in different degrees to 
different minds.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
EDUCATIONAL VALUE 5 
The following is presented as an example of sci- 
entific observation. We built a fire in the furnace 
which smoked much. After it had burned a few 
minutes we opened the door and found it covered 
with drops of a dark brown liquid as thick as molasses 
and having a characteristic odor and taste. A 
piece of burning paper or wood was dropped upon a 
white plate. Drops of the liquid appeared upon the 
plate afterward which resembled closely those found 
upon the furnace door. A paper tube was burned 
at one end and the smoke passed through the full 
length of the tube. The walls of the tube were 
found afterward to be saturated with a liquid like 
that already mentioned. A similar liquid was found 
to drip from the joints of a long stovepipe in a build- 
ing where wood was burned. A similar liquid ap- 
peared to saturate the rind of some ham which 
had been smoked. A scientific imagination is re- 
quired to assist in correlating these observations, 
and a scientific conservatism must be used in draw- 
ing conclusions from them. 
The study of science is valuable for the purpose 
of developing a constructive imagination. The 
scientific imagination is similar to that which en- 
ables a sculptor to see a statue in a block of marble, 
or which enables a painter to imagine to himself 
the picture he is to make upon the canvas, or that 
which enables the architect to form an idea of the 
building he is to construct. The scientific mind 
uses imagination, not only for discovery, but for ap- 
preciating facts. Teachers who suppose that a 
school laboratory is useful only for teaching the 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  
  6 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
inductive method sometimes say that life is too short 
for pupils to spend much time discovering truths 
which have been already discovered. The fact is 
that very little discovery can be expected to take 
place in a school laboratory, but nevertheless the 
laboratory furnishes the only means by which the 
pupil can reach an understanding of the truths of 
his science. Through the microscope one sees only 
minute portions of an object at one time. The con- 
structive imagination needed to form a conception 
of the whole is slowly developed by working with the 
microscope. By laboratory experiments we illus- 
trate in a small way the great phenomena of nature 
— phenomena which are too large to be presented 
as a whole to our observation. A constructive 
imagination is needed to make the transition from 
the laboratory experiment to the natural phenomena. 
For the purpose of developing a constructive imagi- 
nation illustrative experiments have a high value, 
and should be mingled with all quantitative work. 
Scientific observation and a scientific imagination 
were developed to a high degree in Laplace to en- 
able him to conceive the nebular hypothesis; and 
scientific observation, together with scientific imagi- 
nation, is requisite to all who would appreciate how 
the nebular hypothesis explains the way in which 
worlds are made. Scientific observation and a 
scientific imagination enabled Darwin to do his 
work, and without scientific observation and sci- 
entific imagination we shall never be able to ap- 
preciate evolution. 
A person who has acquired the habit of making
-P-A-G-E-23
EDUCATIONAL VALUE 7 
use of scientific investigation, scientific observation, 
and scientific imagination will surely become well 
informed. Most of us are ignorant when we might 
be wise if we would give attention to the phenomena 
which are daily presented on every hand. 
Science teaches conservatism in making and ac- 
cepting conclusions. It begets a desire to examine 
the evidence for everything. It propagates a whole- 
some skepticism in a world which has a passion for 
being hoaxed. If the scientific mind were culti- 
vated more widely, newspapers would not find falsi- 
fying so profitable, advertisements would not be so 
palpably untrue, and history would not need to deal 
with exaggerations in order to be readable. It is 
probable that all the available history that would 
be useful in the education of such a mind might be 
gathered into a very brief course. Science is largely 
a matter of common honesty. The first thing a 
person has to do when he wants to begin to be an 
honest man is to take an inventory of his stock of 
knowledge, or what he has considered knowledge, 
and throw much of it overboard, following the ad- 
vice of that eminent sage who said: “It is better 
not to know so much than to know so many things 
that are not so.” It cannot be doubted that the 
dishonesty of those people who disregard evidence 
does more harm than the dishonesty which we call 
lying and cheating. Certainly the first kind of dis- 
honesty is far more prevalent than the second. 
What one gains by being dishonest with himself 
in respect to the stock of knowledge which he pos- 
sesses, it would be difficult to say; yet there are no

  8 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
possessions to which one is apt to cling so tenaciously 
as to that mass of knowledge which he has adopted 
either without evidence or contrary to evidence. 
The scientific mind enthrones reason above authority. 
The world has suffered too much from authority. 
Ignorant and unreasonable authority has forced 
into submission an ignorant and unscientific world, 
and thus resisted the progress of truth. Even a 
child has an inalienable right to an explanation 
whenever any course he is required to pursue seems 
unreasonable to him. It is tyranny to require un- 
questioning obedience if an explanation is possible. 
Painstaking habits are developed by the exercises 
of a well-conducted scientific laboratory. Teachers 
of science should require carefulness in performing 
experiments, carefulness in taking observations, 
and carefulness in drawing inferences. Careless, 
slipshod experimenting will always go hand-in-hand 
with careless observing and with hasty inferring. 
Most of the knowledge which really is worth while 
has to be dug out by dogged persistence. Perhaps 
our education cannot be too extensive, but it cer- 
tainly is too little intensive. We are sure of noth- 
ing. We do not take time to connect and correlate. 
We do not digest and organize our knowledge. We 
are smatterers. We have a newspaper education. 
We deal in snap judgments. We hold opinions upon 
profound questions without any study whatever. 
Real science study cannot be looked upon as a 
diversion or a device for getting the attention of a 
weary class. If it is worthy the name of science, it 
must be quite as disciplinary as the study of classics
-P-A-G-E-25

or mathematics. It may be pleasurable, but the 
pleasure should be that which comes from a sense of 
increasing power. The student of science will not 
be satisfied with vagueness. He will require that 
his knowledge shall be very definite, and he will, as 
a result of training in science, acquire the power 
of giving expression to his knowledge in very defi- 
nite language. Such masters in science as Huxley, 
Spencer, and Tyndall are masters also in the art of 
saying what they mean. It is chiefly in this respect 
that science furnishes a training in the use of 
language. 
“Common sense” is not a natural heritage; it 
must be acquired. To this end the study of science 
may be made a most potent agency. 
The study of science should develop the capacity 
for earning a living, and at the same time give one 
reasonable ideas about what constitutes good living. 
It should act as a moral ballast. Its devotees are 
not subject to petty vices. It cannot be said of 
them that “they are more afraid of doing things 
conventionally wrong than of doing things morally 
wrong.” 
Science furnishes a basis for true religion. Pro- 
fessor Huxley says: 
“True science and true religion are twin sisters, and the 
separation of either from the other is sure to prove the death 
of both. Science prospers exactly in proportion as it is reli- 
gious; and religion flourishes in exact proportion to the scientific 
depth and firmness of its basis. The great deeds of philosophers 
have been less the fruits of their intellect than of the direction 
of that intellect by an eminently religious tone of mind. Truth 
has yielded herself rather to their patience, their love, their

singleheartedness, and their self-denial, than to their logical 
acumen.” 
Herbert Spencer says : 
“So far from science being irreligious, as many think, it is 
the neglect of science that is irreligious — it is the refusal to 
study the surrounding creation that is irreligious. Take a 
humble simile. Suppose a writer were daily saluted with praise 
couched in superlative language. Suppose the wisdom, the 
grandeur, the beauty of his works were the constant topics of 
the eulogies addressed to him. Suppose those who unceasingly 
uttered these eulogies on his works were contented with looking 
at the outside of them; and had never opened them, much 
less tried to understand them. What value should we put upon 
their praises? What should we think of their sincerity? Yet, 
comparing small things to great, such is the conduct of mankind 
in general, in reference to the universe and its Cause. Devotion 
to science is a tacit worship, a tacit recognition of worth in the 
thing studied; and, by implication, in their Cause. It is not 
mere lip homage, but a homage expressed in actions; not a 
mere professed respect, but a respect proved by the sacrifice of 
time, thought, and labor. Doubtless to the superstitions that 
pass under the name of religion, science is antagonistic, but not 
to the essential religion which these superstitions merely hide. 
Doubtless, too, in much of the science that is current there is 
a pervading spirit of irreligion; but not in that true science 
which has passed beyond the superficial into the profound.” 
The study of science is humanitarian. Professor 
Brinton says: 
“The aims of science are distinctly beneficent. Its spirit 
is that of charity and human kindness. Its mission is noble, 
inspiring, consolatory ; lifting the mind above the gross contacts 
of life, preserving aims which are at once practical, humanitarian, 
and spiritually elevating.” 
Coleridge said that

  EDUCATIONAL VALUE li 
“Sir Humphry Davy would have established himself in the 
first rank of England’s living poets, if the genius of our country 
had not decreed that he should rather be the first in the first 
rank of its philosophers and scientific benefactors.” 
Goethe found nothing inconsistent in the spirit of 
science and the spirit of poetry. Some people give 
their idea of a scientist in the expression “a cold- 
blooded scientist.” If they think that the study of 
science makes one incapable of love, they should read 
the lives of Agassiz and Faraday; and if they think 
that the scientist is incapable of enthusiasm, they 
should visit him in his laboratory or follow him 
through the fields. 
Mr. Spencer says : 
“The current opinion that science and poetry are opposed 
is a delusion. On the contrary, science opens up realms of 
poetry where to the unscientific all is a blank. Is it not indeed 
an absurd, and almost a sacrilegious, belief that the more a man 
studies nature the less he reveres it? Think you that a drop of 
water, which to the vulgar eye is but a drop of water, loses any- 
thing in the eye of the physicist who knows that its elements 
are held together by a force which, if suddenly liberated, would 
produce a flash of lightning? Think you that what is carelessly 
looked upon by the uninitiated as a mere snow-flake does not 
suggest higher associations to one who has seen through a micro- 
scope the wondrously varied and elegant forms of snow-crystals ? 
Think you that the rounded rock marked with parallel scratches 
calls up as much poetry in an ignorant mind as in the mind of a 
geologist, who knows that over this rock a glacier slid a million 
years ago? The truth is that those who have not entered upon 
scientific pursuits know not a tithe of the poetry by which they 
are surrounded. Whoever has not in youth collected plants 
and insects knows not half the halo of interest which lanes and 
hedgerows can assume. Whoever has not sought for fossils 
has little idea of the poetical associations that surround the places

the architecture of the heavens, but are deeply interested in 
some contemptible controversy about the intrigues of Mary 
Queen of Scots !— are learnedly critical over a Greek ode, and

THE ENRICHMENT OF THE HIGH-SCHOOL 
COURSE IN PHYSICS! 
A LEADER in education has said: 
“The education and training afforded by our schools is too 
greatly influenced by the requirements of college entrance. 
Thus the majority are unprovided with the most efficient and 
most useful training for the lives they are to lead. The schools 
teach facts without practical and useful ends in view and with- 
out instruction as to how these facts are to be applied.” 
He says further with reference to the particular 
school under his charge, which sends eighty per cent 
of its pupils to college: 
“There is no alternative. Our efforts must be directed to 
making as good a preparatory school as the colleges will permit ; 
the ideal secondary school must await a more enlightened age of 
higher education.” 
Accepting this as the best statement of the situ- 
ation that can be made, it is probably wise to work 
harmoniously with the present order of things while 
using every effort toward a better order. 
Such an association as this can do much toward 
bringing on that more enlightened age when the 
relation between the college and secondary school

14 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
-shall be similar to that which now exists between 
secondary and elementary schools. This will mean 
that the secondary school will give the pupil what 
he needs and the college will accept a pupil who has 
been educated according to his own needs rather 
than the supposed needs of the college. The needs 
of high-school pupils are much better understood by 
high-school teachers than by college professors, and 
they should determine what should fit them for 
college. Elementary school teachers are acknow]l- 
edged experts upon the educational requirements of 
their own pupils. They would brook no inter- 
ference from high-school teachers were it offered. 
How does it happen that high-school teachers have 
no professional status? To an outsider it would 
appear that high-school physics teachers are badly 
priest-ridden, since they have a syllabus made out 
for them prescribing their work in the minutest 
detail, and they are themselves the only persons 
who know how great a misfit this requirement is 
when applied to the high-school pupil. No other 
department is so throttled. 
Let it be conceded that the high-school teacher’s 
task for the present is both to fit for college and at 
the same time to make his physics teaching as good 
as he can in spite of college requirements. 
The best plan for accomplishing this result seems 
to be that which has already been adopted in a few 
schools, namely, to give first a course in physics 
planned wholly with reference to the needs of the 
pupils, and follow this by a brief course intended to 
present the specific things which will be likely to
-P-A-G-E-31
  HIGH-SCHOOL COURSE IN PHYSICS 15 
appear on the college entrance examination papers. . 
The first course is taken by every pupil who can get 
it on his program. The second is taken only by 
those who are intending to offer physics for college 
entrance. ' 
I cannot agree with those who would restrict 
physics to the select few who are mathematically 
inclined and have perhaps a technical course in 
view. Physics appears to me to be a subject which 
all pupils need. The community is now demanding 
it for their children. Teachers of other subjects 
adapt their instruction to the needs of the majority 
of their pupils. Physics teachers must do likewise. 
The college entrance course in physics is too meager 
in general information and in the applications of 
physics to daily experience. If the high-school 
teacher of English were given a syllabus which di- 
rected the teaching of grammar alone without lit- 
erature, his case would be quite parallel to that of 
the physics teacher. 
The course needs enrichment by the addition of 
large measures of information. Some teachers with 
excessive allegiance to the inductive method not only 
refuse to give information, but also to use simple 
and direct means of illustration. Why should the 
department which has the most interesting and 
most valuable information — information which 
bears directly upon the common life and happiness of 
every one — be so chary of giving it to the pupils? 
Other departments give information freely, and they 
take a strong hold upon the pupils; but some teachers 
of physics appear to conduct the course as though
-P-A-G-E-32
  16 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
they would say to a pupil, “You may have only 
such knowledge as you can find out for yourself 
first hand.” Getting knowledge first hand is not an 
elementary process. Postgraduate students when 
sifted down to the few candidates for the doctor’s 
degree handle it with indifferent success. No in- 
dividual, however expert, has by the arduous labors 
of a lifetime been able to get first hand any con- 
siderable amount of knowledge. If we teach high- 
school pupils that they can acquire knowledge first 
hand without appeal to authority, we are deceiving 
them and we are in danger of making prigs of them. 
What goes on in a high-school laboratory is neither 
induction nor verification. It is simply an attempt 
to get a realizing sense of things by coming in con- 
tact with them. Without the laboratory the pupils 
would get only inklings; with the laboratory they 
get some appreciation of what you are trying to 
teach them. Without the laboratory they become 
dazed and soon tire of the subject; with the labora- 
tory properly conducted they get that taste of physics 
which makes them want further information with an 
eagerness which is irresistible. A good deal of in- 
forthation in the field of physics is due them, and 
the course should be greatly enriched in this direc- 
tion. High-school pupils are not able to receive 
information in the brief, formal statements of the 
@jext-books. They need prolixity. The statements 
of principles need to be very much amplified. 
Tyndall’s book of six hundred pages on Heat is more 
comprehensible to them than the forty or fifty pages 
of the high-school text-books on the same subject.
-P-A-G-E-33
HIGH-SCHOOL COURSE IN PHYSICS 17 
The reading of articles from books of reference and 
the current magazines is quite as necessary in 
physics as in English or history. 
It has been the fashion to decry the lecture as a 
means of teaching physics. This is probably due 
to the prevailing idea that one must not give infor- 
mation, but must leave everything for the pupil to 
find out for himself. The skillful teacher, however, 
conducts his course so that no restraint needs to be 
put upon either of these processes. The more in- 
formation he gives the more he stimulates the self- 
activity of the pupil, and with a broader understand- 
ing of his subject the pupil works more intelligently 
at his appointed tasks. Davy, Faraday, Tyndall, 
and hosts of others have made good use of lectures. 
Lectures illustrated by many experiments skill- 
fully performed and skillfully explained; illustrated 
by lantern slides, charts, and blackboard sketches ; 
illustrated by constant appeal to daily experiences ; 
illustrated by graphic word pictures and the use of 
analogies, — such lectures in the hands of a teacher 
of science furnish not only information, but several 
other essential features of instruction not covered 
by the forty quantitative experiments. 
College professors in physics habitually complain 
that students. da not- generalize. They may have 
been trained to experiment accurately, but they do 
not relate facts. The biographers of Sir Humphry 
Davy characterize his investigations as brilliant. 
He reached conclusions in incredibly short time. 
They speak of his wonderful power of generalization 
and call it “genius,” “insight,” “instinct.” They 
c  
-P-A-G-E-34
  18 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
speak of his constant use of analogies, of his fertile 
imagination. These traits have characterized all suc- 
cessful scientists to a greater degree than some of 
us like to admit. It cannot be the business of cer- 
tain departments to encourage these things and of 
others to kill them. The processes of education 
must be better correlated than that. 
Even if all high-school pupils were being trained 
for original research, it may be claimed for the 
lecture that it has equal value with laboratory work. 
Our chief difficulties at the present time, however, 
arise from the very erroneous idea that they are 
being so trained. In pursuance of this idea a por- 
tion of the college course in physics is crowded into 
the high school, and together they are intended to 
lead directly toward graduate courses in research. 
Since, however, few will follow that course to the 
end, few are disposed to begin it in the high school. 
There is no good reason on any ground why methods 
of research should be linked to high-school instruc- 
tion. It would be a sad fate if, after fighting hard 
to get some science into the high school; and having 
secured the introduction of physics very generally 
throughout the country; and having forced the 
majority of pupils out of physics, contrary to their 
needs and desires, so that you might fit the minority 
for college; and having introduced into this col- 
lege preparatory course, at the suggestion of the 
college professors, a kind of work so ill adapted to 
the high-school pupil that it does not even fit him 
for college, you should at last be discredited as edu- 
cators and some other subject be put in the place for-  
-P-A-G-E-35
  
HIGH-SCHOOL COURSE IN PHYSICS 19 
feited by physics. Yet this, we hear on every hand, 
is upon us unless some radical change occurs soon. 
The kind of physics, which enabled us to win the 
fight for introduction into the high-school course 
twenty years ago was that which was well repre- 
sented by the first edition of Gage’s Elements. For 
fifteen years that sort of physics made exceedingly 
good progress in the high schools. It undoubtedly 
had much to do with bringing on public interest in 
scientific matters. But in spite of the fact that 
public interest in physics is still on the increase, we 
have, inside the schools, turned the tide against 
physics and are slowly driving the pupils from the 
subject. I cannot believe that the public, whose 
interest in the schools is also on the increase, will 
long permit this state of affairs to exist. 
I believe that high-school physics should be the 
study of phenomena, and physical principles should 
be taught solely for the purpose of explaining the 
phenomena. Learning principles should not be 
the end of any study. Formulas, definitions, and 
laws are misplaced and misused. They do not be- 
long at the beginning, but at the end of the subject. 
They are the crystallized forms of statement useful 
to engineers and others who have digested the prin- 
ciples and need them in that shape for ready refer- 
ence. They are also useful for those who are going 
up for examinations, for which purpose they are 
best crammed the night before. It would be a waste 
of energy to carry them throughout the course. 
The text-book should be more than a dictionary of 
physical principles and a glossary of physical terms.  
-P-A-G-E-36
  20 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
It should be a book of information written in a 
readable style. It will serve its purpose better if 
it leaves all descriptions of experiments and prob- 
lems to the laboratory manual. The criticism, 
therefore, that a text-book is not sufficiently quan- 
titative or does not pursue the induction method 
should be irrelevant. These things belong to the 
laboratory manual. 
The forty quantitative experiments can be very 
much abridged and lose nothing either in educa- 
tional value or in effective preparation for college. 
Quantitative problems upon data given might very 
well take the place of many of them. These could 
be worked out at home just as the problems in 
algebra are. If physics is to hold its own among the 
other high-school studies, more home work must be 
devised for it and it must absorb more of the daily 
attention of the pupil. When physics is made easy 
and interesting, there is often a large compensation 
in voluntary outside effort. Unless we are sure 
that we are sufficiently wise doctors in education to 
safely prescribe a dietary distasteful to the pupils, 
it would seem to be better to give them bread than a 
stone, because their appetites demand it. They re- 
ceive more, they work over it more diligently, and 
they digest it better. We might let them have 
more of electricity and not compel them to take so 
much of mechanics. They might spend less time on 
electrical measurements and none at all on measure- 
ments from a battery cell. They might omit the 
calibration of a thermometer and “double weigh- 
ing” with the balance. 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  HIGH-SCHOOL COURSE IN PHYSICS 21 
A quantitative experiment or problem should be 
the goal toward which several qualitative experi- 
ments, or perhaps personal experiences, point. To 
illustrate: The kitchen stove cools off more quickly 
than the hot-water tank. A teaspoon taken out 
of a cup of tea cools quickly, but a teaspoonful of 
tea does not cool quickly. The sand on the sea- 
shore both heats more quickly and cools more 
quickly than the water in the sea. A few teaspoons 
taken out of hot water and put into cold water will 
convey very much less heat than an equal weight 
of the hot water added to the cold water. Bodies of 
water modify climate by giving out large stores 
of heat in cold weather and absorbing large stores 
of heat in hot weather. Thus it happens that is- 
lands in the sea and lakes on the mainland have 
equable climates. High-school pupils are familiar 
with these facts, but they have not related them. 
When they have been led to do this it adds much to 
their appreciation of the whole matter to determine 
the specific heat of some substance by a quantita- 
tive experiment; and, if the quantitative experiment 
is allowed, say, one-quarter of the time spent in the 
study of specific heat, it may be the cream of the 
whole matter, but if it is the only thing taught 
under specific heat, it is pretty nearly valueless. 
High-school pupils come to the study of physics 
with a large number of experiences which bear upon 
the subject, but their experiences have been largely 
of the unconscious type. If therefore “science is 
merely organized common sense,” the teacher must 
call up these experiences and organize them. In this 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  
  22 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
matter the teacher who deals with country pupils 
is thought to have the advantage, since country 
pupils are reputed to have had more experiences 
in the line of physics; but let us consider what the 
city has to offer. 
A well-equipped city school building contains 
many applications of physical principles : 
The furnace and boiler. 
Direct and indirect heating systems. 
Ventilation. 
Automatic control of temperature. 
Steam used for power. 
Hydraulic and electric elevators. 
The plumbing of the building. 
Filters. 
The lighting of the building. 
Electric motors. 
Electric bells, telephones, and clocks. 
The piano, illustrating the various principles of 
sound. 
A great variety of machines which are superior to 
the laboratory apparatus for purposes of instruction. 
Some pupils have observed these things and 
thought much about them, others have noticed them 
but thought little about them, and still others have 
neither noticed nor thought of them. Excursions 
about the building will enable the teacher to supply 
to all some of the necessary experiences upon which 
to found his instruction, which will take the form of 
correlating and interpreting these experiences in the 
light of physical principles. 
The home, and the city outside of the school

building, are full of the applications of physics. ; 
The citizen must square his life according to physical 
principles whether he wishes to or not. It is our 
privilege and duty to conduct this study so as to 
enable him in some measure to make his life more 
peaceful and more successful.

CHEMISTRY TEACHING + 
Tue excellent paper on College Entrance Ex- 
aminations ? which was read at your meeting one 
month ago contains one suggestion which I heartily 
adopt as the central theme of this paper. It is 
more descriptive and less mathematical physics and 
(I may add) chemistry. 
The history of physics teaching in secondary 
schools for the past 25 years naturally divides itself 
into two periods. During the first 13 years of this 
period physics was taught without help or hindrance 
from the colleges, and it progressed against fearful 
odds until 24 per cent of all secondary school pupils 
were studying the subject; during the last 12 years 
the colleges have dominated the physics teaching in 
the secondary schools through their syllabi, inter- 
preted and enforced by their examinations, and it 
has declined until the number of pupils in physics 
has been reduced to 10 per cent. Twelve years ago 
24 per cent of the students selected physics voluntar- 
ily; now a considerable portion of the 10 per cent 
study it only by compulsion.

  MODERN TREND OF PHYSICS 25 
The kind of physics which was taught during the 
first period is well represented in the earlier editions 
of Gage’s and Avery’s text-books. It was descrip- 
tive of matter of universal interest and abundantly 
illustrated by experiments exceedingly well adapted 
to make the subject real. I have been collecting 
testimony for the past 18 years from persons all 
over the country who studied physics then, and I 
find that the general feeling is that it was both in- 
teresting and profitable. Such testimony has been 
steadily changing. into adverse criticism of the 
physics teaching of the last 12 years. 
In recent years physics teaching in the colleges 
also has been growing more unsatisfactory to gen- 
eral students. It is becoming more and more de- 
ficient in both the humanitarian and the practical 
elements. It does little for general culture and less 
for common sense. It is good preparation for neither 
investigators nor engineers, and least of all for the 
ordinary citizen. In recent times college men have 
set out to know only one thing, and have omitted to 
conquer a sufficient field of related knowledge to 
understand any one thing well enough to teach it. 
We have witnessed the attempt to force the worst 
features of college instruction upon the secondary 
schools, and we have in many cases seen young men 
come directly from such a régime of college physics 
to teach in our secondary schools. They confine 
themselves to that disjointed skeleton of dry bones, 
the forty quantitative experiments.: They use them 
as simply isolated, detached mathematical problems. 
They make no logical connections. They know 
   
-P-A-G-E-42
26 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
little of an articulate whole. They know nothing 
of practical applications of physical principles, and 
they know nothing of the correlations of physics 
and chemistry with botany, zodlogy, physiology, 
geology, geography, and the like. Of course they 
cannot clothe their skeleton of forty experiments 
with symmetry and beauty, for they have never 
been taught any such thing in physics. They deal 
in academic discussions about per cents of error. 
They present nothing as organized common sense, 
which was Huxley’s idea of science. It is not be- 
cause these college entrance requirements are dif- 
ficult, but because they are a misfit, that they are 
uninteresting; and the pupils have the good sense to 
dislike them. Until the makers of the physics 
syllabus exhibit a greater knowledge of the science 
of teaching, we may conclude that the desires of 
the great majority of high-school pupils furnish us 
the safest guide to what is pedagogically correct. 
As one of your members said here last month: 
“These college entrance requirements have been shaped by 
specialists whose interest has been in the subject rather than in 
the student.” 
They do not understand high-school pupils. How 
can they understand what will fit them for college ? 
The chief trouble with high-school pupils when they 
pass into college is not that they are deficient in 
mathematics or in the art of making accurate 
measurements, but that they do not generalize, 
and the work prescribed is not calculated to help 
them learn how to do so. The claim has been put
-P-A-G-E-43
  MODERN TREND OF PHYSICS Q7 
forth by certain teachers that theirs is a “good stiff 
course in physics,” that it is equivalent to Greek 
forsooth, and every other course has been charac- 
terized by opprobrious titles. Their favorite expres- 
sion of contempt is “‘sugar-coating the pill” and the 
favorite expression of satisfaction with their own 
work is that they are giving “a self-respecting course 
in physics.” Now I cannot discover why their course 
should be called “good” or “stiff” or'even “physics.” 
(One professor of mathematics says he is willing to 
accept it as algebra and geometry.) I presume no 
teacher ever has or ever will get what may properly 
be called “good work” from a student except by the 
force of a “compelling interest.”’ Let us consider 
what there is in these experiments which a reason- 
able high-school pupil could object to. 
A considerable number of them are clumsy, tedious 
ways of getting results which the pupils know they 
can get by more direct means. A great ado is made 
about getting the specific gravity of wood. All 
wood is heavier than water, but they set out to prove 
that a certain block is half as heavy as water. It 
floats on water for the same reason that an empty 
bottle floats. If we let the water enter and drive 
out the air, both sink. It makes a difference whether 
the wood comes from inland or seashore; from the 
north side of a hill or the south side; whether it is 
green or dry or kiln-dried; whether it is summer or 
winter. In winter our closet doors shrink so that 
we can poke our fingers through. In summer they 
swell so that we cannot shut them. The teachers try 
to coat the block of wood with paraffin so that air 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
    28 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
shall not get out nor water get in. No one has yet 
learned how to keep wood from shrinking and 
swelling. The pupils, who are often wiser than 
doctors of philosophy, know that their teachers are 
making a pretense of getting the specific gravity 
of this block of wood merely for the sake of an 
academic discussion. Now note how the instructors 
proceed. They simply want the weight and the vol- 
ume of that block. The weight is procured directly, 
but the volume, which might be procured directly by 
measuring a regular-shaped block, is thought to be 
more accurately found by measuring the amount 
of water which it will displace. And instead of 
sticking a pin into it and thrusting it down into a 
vessel full of water and measuring the overflow, 
they tie a lead sinker to it so as to introduce more 
mathematics into the problem. They spend weeks 
finding the specific gravity of various things by 
various methods; finding the breaking strength of 
a wire; comparing wires in breaking tests; finding 
how much a wire will stretch ; bending laths by vary- 
ing loads; bending laths of varying dimensions; 
twisting laths — all to no purpose. Such procedure 
has no connection with anything else either in the 
course or out of it. Nearly the whole of the first 
half-year is spent on this work which is related to 
nothing. Meanwhile the students are eager to get 
into electricity, but when at last they reach that sub- 
ject they are cruelly disappointed because everything 
that has a practical bearing is carefully eliminated 
and academic discussions are substituted about 
things never met outside the school laboratory. The
-P-A-G-E-45

experiments in electricity are such as no electrical 
engineer would have any patience with. 
Teachers who watch every opportunity to nip in 
the bud any symptom of interest or enthusiasm se- 
lect the coefficient of expansion of iron as a subject 
worthy of a whole week’s study. The sole aim of 
the work is to have the pupils determine whether a 
rod of iron will expand by one twelve-millionth part 
of its length for one degree rise in temperature. 
They first consider at some length the sources of 
error, and discuss the efficiency of the apparatus. 
The whole rod must be brought to a uniform tem- 
perature. It must therefore be surrounded by a 
hot-water or steam jacket. The thermometer must 
be placed in such a position as to get the true tem- 
perature of the rod itself. There must be some 
sort of multiplying apparatus to measure such slight 
increments of length, and this will introduce some 
mathematics which will exercise a wholesome re- 
straint upon enthusiasm. The experiment is per- 
formed and the results are discussed again with 
reference to sources of error. The class average is 
taken and compared with standard figures, etc., 
etc. Now if that is the end of the whole matter (as 
it very often is) it seems to me not worth while. It 
is not “stiff.” It is stupid. The pupils are not 
complaining of hard work, they are objecting to 
stupid work. They are capable, and willing to do 
much harder work if it appeals to them as worth 
while. 
Suppose now we treat the expansion of iron by 
first performing some of the many simple, in-
-P-A-G-E-46
30 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
genious, and beautiful experiments which illustrate 
it. Let some of these be lecture experiments and 
some individual laboratory experiments. Let the 
question arise what will happen to a steam pipe 
1000 feet long when the engineer puts on steam 
and raises its temperature from, say, 60° to 212°. 
It will lengthen about one foot. The class will be 
interested in calculating that from data given in 
the text-book, and certain pupils will want to verify 
the data by a quantitative experiment on the 
coefficient of expansion. A few optional experi- 
ments are always needed to give to the brightest 
pupils in order to keep the class abreast. The 
whole class want to go on an excursion about the 
building to see what provision is made for this ex- 
pansion of the steam pipes and hot-water pipes. 
They want to know what provision is made for the 
expansion of the iron work of the Brooklyn Bridge 
between winter and summer. And they would be 
glad to calculate how much that expansion might 
be; how much a wagon tire 5 feet in diameter is 
stretched by heating it 500° for purposes of setting 
it. Illustrations of this sort can be multiplied until 
a week is thought by the class to be all too short for 
the subject. 
I do not believe that high-school pupils are lack- 
ing in either willingness to work or ability to work. 
They are patient sufferers with what they know to 
be poor teaching. 
Secondary schools are not dependent upon the 
colleges. They depend directly upon the public, 
and the colleges are equally dependent upon the 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  MODERN TREND OF PHYSICS 31 
public. Certainly no subjects are nearer to the 
public mind than physics and chemistry, and pub- 
lic sentiment will in time settle these questions for 
both colleges and secondary schools. It will un- 
doubtedly determine that the secondary schools 
shall teach such physics as all girls and boys in the 
schools may pursue with profit to themselves. 
(Some teachers are now congratulating themselves 
that they have crowded out of physics the great 
majority and have left only the mathematical elect, 
and some teachers of physics avow it to be their 
purpose to kill enthusiasm wherever they find it.) 
Public sentiment will further determine that the 
colleges shall receive any pupil who has been taught 
according to his own needs, and that the colleges 
shall learn how to continue his instruction accord- 
ing to his own needs. I presume that in both the 
secondary school and the undergraduate college, 
physics will in time be humanized. It will be 
taught with reference to its practical applications, 
not solely for commercial reasons, but also because 
of its universal human interests. 
As indicating the modern trend of thought on 
this subject, I will present numerous quotations 
from various writers and speakers. 
Professor Hall of Harvard is doing us the great 
service of reproducing in the Educational Review 
considerable portions of the report of Professor Karl 
Fischer of Munich on his studies of the prevailing 
condition of instruction in physics and chemistry 
in the secondary schools of various countries. The 
articles contain much of what appears to be a con-
-P-A-G-E-48
  32 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
sensus of opinion from many countries. They 
abound in such phrases as these : 
“Mathematical developments [in physics] are to be avoided 
... more stress is to be laid on the spirit of the method than on 
technical details . . . the calculations kept as simple as possible, 
should be based on actual relations. ... Numerical problems, in 
and for themselves of little profit, should not be given in greater 
number than is necessary to insure the insight of the pupils into 
the relations exemplified in the problems. ... The striving after 
too great precision is a mistake . . . demonstration instruction 
should be made as practical as possible . . . theories without in- 
terest, calculations which have nothing to do with realities, are to 
be dropped. ... The object is not to make of the pupils accom- 
plished physicists but to make them acquainted with the great 
laws of nature and to lead them to give account to themselves 
of the operations which they see going on about them. ... Offi- 
cial programs prescribe too exactly the matter to be taught.” 
Professor H. E. Clifford, of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, said a few months ago 
before the Eastern Association of Physics Teachers : 
“Tn any course of physics the fundamental instruction should 
be by classroom work which should be made more vital by the 
laboratory. The classroom comes first in usefulness and 
efficiency in instilling the fundamental ideas, and the laboratory 
second. A well-illustrated course of lectures is more valuable 
than a well-equipped laboratory. The laboratory work should 
be qualitative, not quantitative. It should aim at accuracy in 
observation, not accuracy in measurement. The explanation of 
everyday phenomena is the true function of high-school physics.” 
Professor W. S. Franklin, of Lehigh University, 
one of the examiners in physics for the College En- 
trance Board, ‘said recently at a meeting of the 
New Jersey State Teachers’ Association :
-P-A-G-E-49
  MODERN TREND OF PHYSICS 33 
“Tt is not important that high-school physics should be 
quantitative or mathematical, it should be phenomenology.” 
President Stanley Hall, as quoted by Professor 
Charles Baskerville to the New York Chemistry 
Teachers’ Club: 
“The finest expression on the face of a child seems to me to 
be that of open-eyed and often open-mouthed curiosity and 
wonder. The objects of nature charm and entrance the soul, 
which for the moment becomes almost one with her... . 
This divinest thing in childhood, which only bad school methods 
can kill, which prompts the primeval experiments of infants in 
learning to use their senses, limbs, and minds upon nature, is 
the root of the spirit of research, which explores, pries, inquires, 
so persistently, and often so destructively in older children, 
and comes to full maturity in the investigator behind the tele- 
scope or microscope, in the laboratory, seminary, library, or on 
exploring expeditions.” 
To which Professor Baskerville adds : 
“Each one of us has done his little research in college or 
university, and knows that it was but an extension of his ex- 
perience as a boy. ... Having once breathed that fragrance 
of the new, having once been allowed to pluck a seed from the 
unknown storeroom of the Almighty, having once nursed it 
into a flower, however beautiful or unattractive, I fail to see 
how one, by the very fever of the thing, could look on that one 
creation and not be swept along by the desire to make a garden 
of such joys, for each birth is a happiness, not solely for selfish 
pleasure, but that the world might also look in and rejoice.” 
Professor Louis Sherman Davis, Indiana Uni- 
versity, says: 
“Interest in a science is proportioned to the immediate bear- 
ing which its subject-matter has upon the life of the student. 
Hence the matter and processes with which chemistry deals 
should touch the student’s life as closely as possible.”

-P-A-G-E-50
34 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
In accordance with this view he arranged his 
text-book so as to teach chemical principles in 
their relationship to industrial purposes, such as 
preparation of iron and steel, explosives, artificial 
ice, illuminating gas, baking powder, petroleum, 
butter, soap, sugar, glass, paints, etc. 
Professor C. R. Mann, University of Chicago, in 
School Science and Mathematics, October, November, 
and December, 1905: 
“Tf an instructor has once clearly grasped the fact that the 
so-called principles and laws of science derive their final accu- 
racy from our powers of abstraction, can he confine the stu- 
dent’s attention so assiduously as is often done to a per cent 
and half a per cent of error? Far be it from us to decry the 
importance — nay, the vital necessity — of such considerations 
of accuracy in advanced research work. But do we not some- 
times forget that the high-school pupil is not a research spe- 
cialist, and that he is as a rule not enamored of great accuracy ? 
Do we not then develop rather his manual dexterity than his 
reason and his imagination? . . . do we not often fail to make 
use of the vast fund of physical experiences which every one 
necessarily possesses simply because he has lived on this planet ? 
Yet we often reject in whole or in part this fund of real experi- 
ence and expect to develop a system that shall be comprehensive 
and exact on the basis of comparatively few rather clumsy stock 
experiments with half a hundred percentages of error thrown in 
for good measure. 
“But the real vitality of physics is not in these external 
signs and symbols, but rather in the human part —the scientific 
imagination; and any student who leaves his physics class for 
the last time without ever having felt an inspiration to ponder 
over and try to form images of the operations of the world 
forces amongst which he lives, has been filled with husks and 
empty forms and dwarfed in soul and mental growth... . 
When we ‘fix’ [physical laws] into a system of dogma, de- 
velop them into a logically perfect series, and then dole them
-P-A-G-E-51
  MODERN TREND OF PHYSICS 35 
out to growing, living, thirsty souls . . . we are but exhibiting 
to them a veritable ‘physical mummy’ and should not be sur- 
prised if the children turn from it chilled with indifference rather 
than warmed with enthusiasm. 
“He [the student] usually has a large amount of qualitative 
personal experience with the subject-matter of science, and can 
generally obtain a large store of personally observed facts in 
the routine of his daily life. . . . It is an interesting fact that 
children trained to observe carefully and to reason from these 
observations clearly and in freedom, remember both the facts 
and the conclusions better than if they are taught the conclu- 
sions as a matter of authority. Though it may seem para- 
doxical, it is yet true, that if we make it our aim to teach the 
facts and principles of science, we fail; but if we have as our 
sole purpose the development in the children of this scientific 
attitude, they not only acquire that most valuable possession, 
but also learn the principles better. Moreover, by the adoption 
of this aim, the sciences become truly correlated.... A 
vast advance over the methods at present in vogue in science 
teaching could be made if each teacher would try to present 
his subject more from the historical and concrete side and less 
in the purely logical and abstract one — if he would try to con- 
nect the history of his special subject with the grander general 
history of thought — and of human activity. 
“We need to get closer to Nature and to absorb the warmth 
of the greater human life about us. We do not need new and 
more ingenious apparatus in our laboratories; nor yet novel and 
elegant methods of demonstrating this or that principle; but 
greater outlook and wider sympathies — in a word, less impedi- 
menta and more human life.” 
Professor Mann has written a high-school text- 
book of physics “to meet,” as he says, “the new 
demand that has been made on the subject by the 
general public. . . . The aim has been to show the 
student that a knowledge of physics enables him to 
answer many of the questions over which he has
-P-A-G-E-52
  36 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
puzzled long in vain.” He aims, as he says, to 
“appeal to students on the humanistic side.” The 
numerical examples are free from mathematical in- 
tricacies, and are based largely on the practical 
problems of everyday life. ‘The latest discoveries 
and theories in science are presented, both because 
young people are known to be interested in them 
and because they serve as nothing else can to develop 
the scientific imagination. ... The mastery of 
principles and methods in scientific study depends 
on the awakening of interest and self-activity more 
than any one thing.” 
Before the New England Association of Chemistry 
Teachers Professor F. L. Bardwell, of the Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology, said: 
“Tnstruction [in chemistry] should be along qualitative lines. 
It may be wise to introduce some quantitative work, but he 
who loses sight of the qualitative side of quantitative experimen- 
tation loses sight of rare beauties in Natural Science and causes 
in his pupils the sort of distorted mental vision which cannot see 
beyond the cross hairs of a telescope or discern any phenomena 
which are not connected with the swing of the pointer of a bal- 
ance . . . don’t forget the one essential thing in laboratory 
work — observation, which must be qualitative before it is 
quantitative . . . let laboratory experimentation be employed 
to drill the pupils in careful manipulation, not necessarily highly 
refined and accurate measurements — and then above all in 
observation and inference. Pupils should be encouraged to 
discover principles — to generalize; and it is well to arrange 
certain experiments which are not complicated and which have 
not been preceded by special instruction so that the beginner 
may have opportunity to generalize without prejudice.” 
Professor F. W. Clarke, in Science, October 23, 
1903, says:
-P-A-G-E-53
  
MODERN TREND OF PHYSICS 37 
“The man who could not see the forest because of the trees 
was a good type of that scholarship which never rises above petty 
details. It may compile encyclopedias, but it cannot generalize.” 
Some one has said : 
“Avoid formulas. Most high-school pupils work with formu- 
las in a very mechanical way and fail to get the rationale of the 
matter. It is only to mature minds that formulas represent 
the gist of the whole matter.” 
Professor H. H. Goddard, State Normal School, 
Oshkosh, Wis., School Science and Mathematics, 
October, 1905: 
“A great company of the great men of science is open to 
our acquaintance among the leaders and investigators of the 
past. ... Their names cannot fail to excite the wonder and 
admiration of all who have followed the achievements of science 
and can be moved by the attainments of the human mind. . . . 
These men live in the triumphs of their investigations into the 
mysteries of science and in the heritage they have left us from 
the secrets of truth. . . . Every student of science should learn 
something of the great difficulties which have been overcome 
in the progress of this line of study. . . . The story should be 
known of how Scheele subjected himself to deprivation and 
even poverty in order that he might give his time and talent to 
scientific discovery. . . . The story of Roger Bacon should be 
told, —of his splendid talent, of his untiring efforts to illumi- 
nate the darkness and ignorance of his time by the searchlight 
of truth, and of the persecutions which he endured as a result. 
The lessons of self-sacrifice and of loyalty to truth which 
are shown by these and many others are of great educational 
value. The opportunity for such lessons can scarcely be ex- 
celled in any other line of study outside of the field of science. 
And such lessons are especially needed in these days of com- 
mercialism and self-aggrandizement, when it is so common to 
associate successful careers only with the accumulation of 
wealth. 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  38 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
“What we as teachers can do is to acquaint our students 
with the fundamental principles of the subject, let them see a 
few of the interesting applications of these, and then not neg- 
lect to inspire them with the splendid story of the growth and 
development of the science, how it has moved forward little by 
little, now retarded by error, but again pushing forward with 
tremendous bounds under the guidance of truth, until with the 
dawn of the present century its achievements are the wonder 
of the world.” 
Professor Sedgwick, on Physiology, in Science, 
September 18, 1903 (his words may very well be 
applied to physics and chemistry) : 
“Not only in childhood but throughout life we do not care 
greatly about the parts of a machine unless we know or can 
guess their use. The instruction in physiology should aim at 
the outlines of the more important functions. ... The pupil 
should understand that the heart is a force pump, but it is not 
necessary that he should understand the exact structure or 
mechanism of the auriculo-ventricular valves. We must teach 
less about anatomy and histology and more about the germ 
theory of disease, about polluted water and polluted milk. We 
must simplify every statement and eliminate the unimportant. 
We must not seek to make of physiology a training in the pre- 
cision of measurements or in scientific method. We must keep 
steadily in view the practical object . . . the rational conduct 
of physical life. We now teach history and economics and civics 
with some reference to the future life of the public school pupil 
as a citizen.” 
He speaks of “arousing a compelling interest in 
the subject.” He also has something to say about 
“arid osteology.” 
For the relief of high-school pupils and teachers 
I propose: 
(1) That the teaching of physics and chemistry in 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
MODERN TREND OF PHYSICS 39 
secondary schools should be less mathematical and 
more descriptive. 
(2) That, in order to secure greater freedom in 
the teaching of high-school physics, the official list 
should be increased by the addition of qualitative 
experiments, and that teachers should be free to 
choose from the whole list any thirty-five to present 
for college entrance.

THE INTENSIVE METHOD IN CHEMISTRY! 
In nearly every presidential campaign we are 
called upon to hold opinions on some difficult prob- 
lems. We feel obliged to vote when we have only 
inklings of the truth. It may take two or three 
campaigns on a particular subject to enable us to 
acquire knowledge that we may clearly define. 
Questions which puzzled the most astute minds a 
few years ago are clearly understood by the average 
mind of to-day. 
This is the way we have gained our knowledge 
of the principles of chemistry. First came inklings 
of ideas. They may have been ruminated upon, 
but they were forgotten as much as we ever forget 
anything. After a time we again met these ideas 
and were startled perhaps to find that we compre- 
hended them much more clearly than before, as 
though the mind had been doing some unconscious 
work upon them meanwhile. This experience may 
recur many times with regard to the same idea until 
finally, after several years perhaps, we see the 
truth with clearness. 
This seems to be a law under which the mind must 
work, —a law which we must reckon with in teach- 
1 Read before the New York Chemistry Teachers’ Club, May 12, 1906. 
40
-P-A-G-E-57
  INTENSIVE METHOD IN CHEMISTRY 41 
ing. We speak contemptuously of our modern 
newspaper civilization with its smattering of ideas, 
but is there proof that men of any other age ever 
did or ever can acquire knowledge by any far dif- 
ferent method ? 
Now it sometimes happens that men, who have 
spent several years passing through this sort of 
experience in the study of chemistry and who have 
arrived at pretty clear ideas themselves, under- 
take to teach these ideas full-fledged to beginners. 
Thoroughness and accuracy are their aim. To go 
slow and cut a clean swath is their method. They 
are champions of the intensive as against the extensive 
method. They demand of beginners definiteness, 
sureness, and completeness of knowledge, and they 
attempt to make a few quantitative experiments 
furnish what time and extended experience alone 
can supply. 
Teach chemistry to beginners — old or young — 
for one year, by whatever method one may choose. 
When they are examined upon the subject the 
next year, their ideas appear to be exceedingly hazy. 
This is of necessity so. It is a law of the mind, and 
teachers should not be ignorant of it. College pro- 
fessors undertake to examine these products of 
the high-school chemistry class and are amazed 
at the results, and their judgments of the pupils 
and their teachers are very unjust. To mitigate 
as far as possible the severity of these unjust judg- 
ments, pupils are put through the senseless but 
very effective process of cramming the answers to 
questions used upon recent examination papers.
-P-A-G-E-58
42 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
It happens that a large number of students take 
their first year of chemistry work in college and the 
assistants, whose duty it is to read the papers, can 
testify that college students at the end of their 
first year’s work in chemistry have a phenomenal 
faculty for giving vague and strange answers to 
examination questions. 
If one teaches a topic three times over, (1) as 
completely as he can in a lecture, (2) as thoroughly 
as he may in the laboratory, and (3) by the study 
and recitation of a text-book, even though he may 
succeed in making the pupil understand each step, 
he will find a few weeks later that the pupil has no 
realizing sense of the matter. He is like a person 
who answers questions correctly when half asleep. 
Pupils in the kindergarten and elementary school 
like repetition. It is the only means by which im- 
pressions are made upon their brains. High-school 
and college students have not passed beyond the 
operation of the same law. The justification for 
carrying along simultaneously the three methods 
of instruction — lecture, laboratory work, and study 
of the text-book — lies in the necessity for reitera- 
tion. This also furnishes ample justification for 
giving college students a course in general chemistry 
even though they may have had an excellent course 
in chemistry in the high school. 
A year’s course of laboratory work consisting of 
thirty-five experiments, mostly quantitative, with 
little lecture work and little text-book work, fur- 
nishes too little repetition and too little perspective. 
When each experiment by itself is intended to 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
INTENSIVE METHOD IN CHEMISTRY 43 
establish one principle, it fails by its meagerness. 
Better have thirty-five groups of experiments, each 
group containing experiments which are closely 
allied, mostly qualitative, and all calculated to give 
different points of view of the same subject. Some 
experiments should be quantitative but generally 
each quantitative experiment should be preceded 
by several of a qualitative nature upon the same 
subject. Some quantitative experiments should be 
assigned to the lecture and some qualitative experi- 
ments should be made laboratory work. Induction 
and verification may play a minor part in the course, 
but all experiments, whether used for lecture or for 
laboratory purposes, should have the main purpose 
of making the subject real. I do not object to inten- 
sive work nor to quantitative experiments. We 
may admit that they are the cream of the whole 
matter and yet insist that, like the nutritive part 
of food, they must be mixed with a large bolus if 
digestion is to proceed. Certainly “the notion 
that an experiment is a vehicle for training in accu- 
racy primarily is a very harmful superstition.” 
We teachers of chemistry need to take courses 
in applied science, we also need courses in biology, 
physiography, and other allied sciences in order 
that we may give a practical turn to our teaching 
of chemistry. The time must come when we shall 
give the higher degrees in education at the university 
for such broad work as that quite as much as for 
the more narrow specialization. 
There are at least three reasons why we should teach 
principles always with reference to their applications :  
-P-A-G-E-60
  dd THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
1. Our pupils get no correct appreciation of the 
principles themselves until they see their applica- 
tions. A subject becomes a science only when its 
principles are related to something. 
2. The subject must be taught with reference 
to its practical application not only for commercial 
purposes but also for the sake of human interest and 
culture. That is a very preposterous claim that 
our friends who call themselves humanitarians make 
—that their subjects alone contribute to human 
interest and human culture. It would be easy for 
us to establish chemistry in the hearts of the people 
as the humanity par excellence, and it is our duty to 
do that. 
3. We must make our subject practical for com- 
mercial reasons. It is our duty to do all in our 
power to help our pupils to earn a living and become 
useful members of society. 
Chemistry is the best of all subjects to lend itself 
to the logical and scientific development of prin- 
ciples. The topics may be so arranged that each 
one shall present further illustration of foregoing 
principles while adding new ones. In this way 
the last half of the year may be almost wholly reiter- 
ation of principles with increasing power to predict 
their applications in new conditions. This is where 
our training in induction comes in. 
As for the main results to be sought I should say 
that, if a pupil understands his text-book in chemis- 
try as well as the average pupil understands his 
history, we ought to be satisfied. I do not agree 
with those who speak slightingly of text-book work
-P-A-G-E-61
  
INTENSIVE METHOD IN CHEMISTRY 45 
in general or of the existing text-books. There are 
a dozen or two text-books for high-school use which 
are very good indeed, and it would be a distinct 
gain if we should abandon the practice of making 
syllabuses and admit to college students who have 
been certificated as having completed any one of 
these text-books with appropriate laboratory work 
to make it real.
-P-A-G-E-62
  Vv 
SCIENCE FOR CULTURE! 
Ir there is anything the matter with science teach- 
ing one may be very hopeful that the difficulty will 
be cured when he considers the number of associa- 
tions and clubs of science teachers formed to dis- 
cuss plans for improving present conditions. 
My subject needs a little definition. 
Probably every one who is teaching science is 
attempting to cultivate something. One aims at 
accuracy, skill, honesty of thought, discipline; 
another aims to cultivate imagination, power of 
generalizing, information, etc. 
I have no disagreement with either party, except 
that they ought not to exist as parties. They 
should combine. The different departments of 
education should work toward one end. Certainly 
it cannot be the duty of one department to tear 
down what another constructs. 
It is my purpose to speak of culture as we generally 
use the term when we speak of culture courses, 
liberal education, etc. 
No one needs imagination more than the investi- 
1 Paper read at the annual meeting of the Central Association of 
Science and Mathematics Teachers, University of Chicago, November 
30, 1906.

-P-A-G-E-63
  SCIENCE FOR CULTURE 47 
gator, and no one has a better opportunity to culti- 
vate it than the teacher of physics. The scientist 
and the humanist have not conflicting duties — 
indeed there is no occasion to make a distinction 
between them. Humanism which is not scientific 
and science which is not humanistic are worthless. 
Professor Cooke says : 
“Science culture differs in its methods from the old classical 
culture, but it has the same spirit and the same object.” + 
Professor Burr, speaking of the fundamental idea 
of the humanists, says : 
“Tt was their open purpose in which they gloried to treat of 
things as they actually existed, to get as near to the life of the 
community as the best knowledge would bring them; in other 
words, to touch human life intimately and at the greatest pos- 
sible number of points.” ? 
Let it be conceded that it is very desirable to 
cultivate accuracy, self-dependence, mental honesty, 
etc. There is no short cut — no royal road to these 
results. Such fruits do not come out of forty labor- 
atory exercises. They are a slow growth of many 
years. Quantitative work simplified, made direct, 
and put in its proper sequence with qualitative work 
may profitably occupy, say, one quarter of the effort 
of a high-school pupil in physics. But science is 
something more than measurement. To be sure 
when men began to measure they took great strides

to a standstill when information and imagination

are wanting. The chief difficulty with science 
teaching to-day, both in the high school and in the 
college, is that we do not give sufficient information. 
Culture courses, or information courses, are often 
spoken of scornfully as a “smattering of all 
the ’ologies.”’ 
We have the mistaken idea that we can cut a 
clean swath in education; can teach a subject 
thoroughly; can treat a few principles and teach 
the whole truth about them first hand. But this 
is to attempt the impossible. Neither the immature 
nor the mature human mind works that way. 
Dr. Simon Newcomb says: 
«The plausible system of learning one thing thoroughly be- 
fore proceeding to another, and taking things up in their logical 
order only, should be abandoned. Let us train the pupil as 
rapidly as possible in the higher forms of thought and not be 
afraid of his having a little smattering of advanced subjects be- 
fore they are reached in regular course. Let us remember that 
thoroughness of understanding is a slow growth, in which un- 
conscious cerebration plays an important part, and leave it to 
be slowly acquired. A teacher aiming at thoroughness might 
have kept Cayley or Sylvester working half his life on prob- 
lems of advanced arithmetic without reaching his standard of 
thoroughness.”’! 
The teachers of De Morgan, the mathematician, 
found him dull in mathematics. 
Let me recall the scene from that charming little 
book, “Philip’s Experiments,” where Philip and his 
father are surveying in the field when the School- 
master is introduced.

“Philip’s schoolmaster pointed out that after he had a sys- 
tematic training in geometry and trigonometry, he would have 
little difficulty with the problems which arise in surveying. He 
also said that the plane table should have a telescope instead of 
rude sights, and he described various accurate instruments, and 
intimated that I was cultivating habits of inaccuracy in Philip. 
Training in science which was not highly accurate he believed 
was worse than no training at all. I listened, but I remembered 
that this teacher had kept Philip at work making highly accu- 
rate measurements with a delicate balance. The boy had not 
appreciated the construction of the balance, for he had never 
made weighings with a rough instrument, and his mind had been 
kept so fixed upon the third place of decimals, that he did not 
appreciate what specific gravity really means. I could see that 
the schoolmaster in his endeavor to refine had forgotten the 
difficulties of an immature mind. Philip was on one contour 
line and he on another, and it would take more than a mega- 
phone to put them into communication.” ! 
“Tn obtaining quantitative work, exactness must be de- 
manded, but exactness is a quality that comes relatively late 
in youthful minds as in that of the race. We are attempting 
to force nature; we are anticipating maturity of mind when 
we crowd into a curriculum subjects in advance of the time 
when the mind of the average boy or girl is able satisfactorily 
to pursue these subjects. . . . Probably the fault is not with 
the subject physics, but with the method. Too much quantita- 
tive work is demanded of both boys and girls; too little atten- 
tion is given to the great names who have developed the subject 
and made inventions household words.” ? 
We are too much afraid of teaching some things 
which have to be modified or even unlearned later. 
“Unlearning” is quite as educational as learning 
and does no harm to a reasonable being, indeed 
it may be a cure for bigotry. It is more important

to cultivate openmindedness than it is to be 
correct. 
Professor Hopkins, in giving a simple, provisional 
definition of an acid, says: 
“At that stage of instruction this simple working definition 
is sufficient. More would be an enormity. What though the 
definition be untrue? The instruction, it is to be remembered, 
demands simplicity and progression—not truth.... It 
shows the subject presented not as a carefully completed, rounded 
and exact definition . . . but as a part-truth at first which 
grows with his capacity for understanding.” 1 
We are too sensitive about being up to date with 
our facts and theories. Since it has become impos- 
sible for any man to keep up with the literature of 
more than one subject, men have become timid 
about teaching more than one subject. But it is 
not difficult to show that the man who keeps himself 
moderately well informed upon the progress in 
several sciences is better prepared to teach than 
the one who knows only one subject. The weakest 
thing about research to-day is that our men are not 
widely informed. 
One who has traveled much and become familiar 
with types of country may find his way through 
an unknown territory and readily suspect it when 
he is approaching a spot sought for. The ant 
studying his grains of sand does not get this view 
of a country, It is the “‘bird’s-eye” view. Sailors 
by extended experience become accurate observers of 
weather phenomena. Miners and farmers and horse 
dealers and experts of all kinds acquire their accuracy 
of knowledge chiefly by the extensive method.

Professor Trowbridge says : 
“The natural progress of our study of any subject is from 
the qualitative, or the comparatively rough evidence of our 
senses, to the quantitative.” 1 
He says we need the countryman’s habit of 
“hefting” a thing before weighing it. 
Teachers in languages are everywhere insisting 
upon the advantages of reading at sight and reading 
widely. Why should teachers of science be slow to 
learn the science of teaching ? 
We talk about trying to rid ourselves of precon- 
ceived notions, but preconceived notions are quite 
essential to progress, and the ability to preconceive 
notions is absolutely essential to research. It is 
no argument against a gift that it is capable of per- 
version. We want to be put in control of our facul- 
ties, not deprived of them by education. 
We have reversed the natural order and tried to 
train high-school pupils in induction. Using the 
forms of induction in the high school may be a 
species of dishonesty. After all, the pupils learn 
not from the experiment but from the teacher or 
the text-book. We teach them to test carbon dioxide 
gas with limewater, but we have to inform them 
that nothing else will turn limewater milky, and 
so it is only a roundabout way of telling them the 
whole story. We have great satisfaction in calling 
this the heuristic method, and we make the children 
prigs by leading them to think that they are acquir- 
ing knowledge first hand.

-P-A-G-E-68
  52 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
The self-activity that high-school pupils need is 
that which they may get in the laboratory by doing 
experiments merely for the purpose of coming in 
contact with things — making their knowledge real 
— acquiring “a certain balance of judgment which 
comes from actual contact with things.” 
“The mind must rest upon physical laws for a comparative 
long period in order to understand their true significance.” ! 
Pupils learn by imitation chiefly. Professor Trow- 
bridge recommends performing in lectures by ex- 
periments which the students afterwards perform 
themselves in the laboratory. 
In many schools throughout this country one 
may find eminently successful teachers of physiog- 
raphy who proudly acknowledge that they learned 
by imitation of Professor William M. Davis both their 
subject and their method of teaching. I should 
characterize Professor Davis’ method as an exceed- 
ingly skillful way of giving the information which 
his students could not acquire first hand in a thousand 
years, and his method is equally successful in pre- 
paring students for research or for teaching. 
The teaching of science should accomplish the 
greatest possible good to the greatest possible num- 
ber. The time was when education proceeded 
without much reference to the public. It was in- 
tended for the select few. A rapid change is in 
progress. Within recent years the public high 
schools have become the most important educa- 
tional institutions in the country. They surpass 
1 John Trowbridge, New Physics, Preface.
-P-A-G-E-69
  
SCIENCE FOR CULTURE 53 
the colleges in buildings, laboratory equipment, and 
teaching force — not only in quantity but in quality. 
In the rapid growth of colleges, the available funds 
have not increased in proportion to the increase in 
number of students. The result is that the classes 
have been assigned inferior instructors. 
The growth of research, by diverting funds and 
diverting men, has caused college teaching to de- 
teriorate. 
The general testimony of students is that they 
work much harder in the high school than in the 
college. Who knows how it might affect the intel- 
lectual and moral character of college students 
to have courses of instruction which were capable 
of absorbing their chief interest? So that they 
would not feel ashamed to say they were more inter- 
ested in their studies than in their diversions. 
Theoretically the pursuit of research ought to 
enrich one’s teaching, but in actual practice atten- 
tion to the art of teaching wanes as attention to 
research increases. The first requisite of a teacher 
is to be actuated by a desire — a fervent desire — 
to instruct others. If one can work at research 
and not have that ardor dampened, it is well. But 
to hold a teacher’s position and to scorn the work 
of teaching is simply dishonest, and even though 
one’s researches may be more valuable to the world 
than his instruction, those who have paid tuition 
for instruction have a just claim against him. Prob- 
ably most of the money received from tuition fees 
and from endowment by undergraduate colleges 
was given for purposes of instruction, but after
-P-A-G-E-70
  
  54 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
diverting much of this to the support of research, 
and after giving the students very indifferent instruc- 
tion, we tell them that their tuition fees do not cover 
the cost of their education. 
These college students have a starvation course 
in measurements called physics. Their tutors, hav- 
ing just passed through the same course with exces- 
sive specialization, are suspicious of that expansive 
thing called culture. They affect to despise, not 
only the public, but all departments of learning other 
than their own. They surpass the theologians in 
narrowing down their lines of orthodoxy. Some 
teachers of science are like polarizers. The truth 
which gleams in all directions is narrowed down to 
one plane when it is transmitted by them. Their 
standards would unclass Davy, Faraday, Tyndall, 
Pasteur, Humboldt, Maxwell, Huxley, Agassiz, 
Cooke, Shaler, and the like, for these men all 
preached the doctrine that science is good for cul- 
ture and should be given to all. Those who inter- 
pret science as cold blooded and exclusive have not 
only nine-tenths of mankind against them, but a 
majority of the men of science and particularly the 
leaders of all time. 
Davy was a poet and his high literary abilities 
made him a great teacher and likewise aided pro- 
foundly his researches. All of the men mentioned 
above were Natural Philosophers with all the di- 
versity of interests which that title indicates. All 
were humanists and many of them devoutly reli- 
gious. 
The influence of the college in all departments,
-P-A-G-E-71
  
SCIENCE FOR CULTURE 55 
classical as well as scientific, is toward driving cul- 
ture, in the sense in which I am using it, out of the 
schools: first, by narrowing the education which 
it gives to those who go out to teach in the schools ; 
and, second, by prescribing a syllabus for the schools 
narrowly interpreted by examiners and bigotedly 
enforced by readers of examination papers. The 
schools cannot even give a cultural course in music. 
The brevity of life makes it necessary to have every- 
thing count toward entrance into college, and the 
college accepts only musical mathematics. There 
is not a department which is not handicapped in 
this same way. It is impossible to teach anything 
as a culture when it is necessary to prepare for 
examination — particularly an examination set by 
another person. No one can justly estimate the 
progress and the proficiency of a class except one 
who has been with them throughout their study. 
If a supervisor’s examination is thought to be 
necessary, let the teacher prepare’ the questions 
and submit both questions and answers to the 
supervisor. A “reader” in four minutes passing 
upon a year’s work of a student wholly unknown 
to him is an absurdity. 
I cannot look upon a syllabus as a blessing even 
though it may be prepared by a majority of the 
teachers. Why should uniformity be thought neces- 
sary or desirable? The ‘“‘New Movement among 
Physics Teachers” is very helpful so long as it 
keeps in a state of solution, but we may regret its 
crystallization. One may hope that if we must 
have a syllabus, it may be extensive enough to in-
-P-A-G-E-72
    56 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
clude all that may be desired by any considerable 
number of teachers, and that each teacher shall 
be allowed great freedom of choice within the sylla- 
bus. 
The high schools are coming nearer in touch with 
the public mind every day. They are powerfully 
influencing public sentiment and are in turn being 
profoundly influenced by public sentiment. We 
have lately had evidence that science was in the 
ascendancy in the minds of the people by their vast 
gifts for equipping schools and colleges for teaching 
science; but unless our teaching is adapted to the 
needs of the majority, we shall soon see the funds 
drifting in other directions, or what is more likely, 
we shall see ourselves drifted away from our moorings 
by the resistless tide. 
In the ultimate analysis the same public supports 
the colleges and the schools. The college looks to 
the public for its funds, whether they be legacies 
or legislative grants or tuition receipts; it looks to 
the public for exemption from taxation; it looks to 
the public for the patronage of its sons and daughters. 
The public in turn demands of the colleges better 
service in the matter of giving instruction. 
People have recently learned that they must 
square their lives according to physical principles, 
and they and their children have turned to educa- 
tional institutions for information with an eager- 
ness that is irresistible. 
Their children have increased the attendance 
upon the colleges fivefold in recent years, and they 
themselves have entered university extension courses
-P-A-G-E-73
SCIENCE FOR CULTURE 57 
in countless thousands. In some cases, the extension 
courses furnish quite as good instruction as any 
given at the university. Faraday was started on 
his course as a scientist by Davy’s public lectures, 
and Cooke! says that he got his first taste of real 
knowledge from the lectures at the Lowell Institute, 
although he was a pupil in the Boston Latin School 
at the time — and that taste awakened an appetite 
which was never satisfied. Cooke says he eagerly 
sought the popular science of the day, which was 
vastly inferior to what we have to-day. We may 
now rank a few of the daily newspapers among 
our better teachers of Science. Huxley said, 
“Science is not solely for the men of science but for 
the people.” 
General courses in college should be culture 
courses. They should be what their name indicates 
—general surveys. A majority of the students 
in such courses will not and ought not to pursue the 
subject longer than one year, when we come to bal- 
ance up the claims of all the subjects in a liberal 
course. Why then do the instructors persist in 
giving them that which is absolutely meaningless, 
unless it be joined to a protracted study of one sub- 
ject for several years, and why do they give them 
that which properly belongs not so much at the 
beginning as at the end of the course in that par- 
ticular subject? Such general-survey courses are 
quite as important to those who will go on to special- 
ize in the subject as to the students who will pursue 
it no farther. Large knowledge acquired by gen-

  58 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
eral surveys in many fields is necessary before one 
can select and organize. During his career in high 
school and undergraduate college a student should 
be encouraged to take general cultural courses in 
each and all the sciences whether his aim is to special- 
ize or not. 
“The time has already come when to know any one of the 
sciences thoroughly it is necessary to know the rest; in fact, 
all the so-called natural sciences are different branches of one 
great science.” ! 
It is not possible to get an elementary knowledge 
of any one science except by this process of browsing 
among many. 
2 “We have a duty to our children which we cannot avoid, if 
we would, and for which we shall be held responsible by our 
posterity. These children are entering life surrounded not only 
by all the wonders and glories of nature, but, also, by giant con- 
ditions, which, whether stationed on their path as a blessing or a 
curse, will inevitably strike if their behests are not obeyed. So 
far as science has been able to define these giant forms, it is our 
duty, as it is our privilege, to point them out to those we are 
bound to protect and guide; and in many cases it is in our power 
to change the curse into a blessing, and to transform the destruc- 
tive demon into a guardian angel. After that command of lan- 
guage which the necessities of civilized life imperatively require, © 
there is no acquisition which we can give our children that will 
exert so important an influence on their material welfare as a 
knowledge of the laws of nature, under which they must live 
and to which they must conform; and throughout whose uni- 
versal dominion the only question is whether men shall grovel 
as ignorant slaves or shall rule as intelligent servants. 
“It is perfectly possible for a child before fifteen years of age

to acquire a real and living knowledge of the fundamental facts 
of nature on which physical science is based. This is not a 
question of natural endowment or special aptitude. 
“To arouse a love of study in any subject is to take the first 
step toward making your man a scholar (I want to emphasize 
scholar), while to fail to gain his interest in any study is to lose 
the whole end of education.” 
1 “We greatly wrong a pupil if we leave him unfitted to enter 
into the great inheritance of scientific truth obtained by past 
and present research. In striving to work out this problem let 
us, first, inculcate a habit of scientific thinking, second, give as 
wide a knowledge as possible, and third, awaken an interest 
which shall be lasting.” 
Mr. Roy Fryer says: 
2“That course is best which contributes most to general 
information and culture by acquainting the pupil with a wide 
range of chemical facts, while at the same time it trains his 
powers of observation and of reasoning from those observations.” 
We make a great mistake when we shape our 
courses so as to eliminate all except those who are 
mathematically inclined and ready for specialization. 
3 “No educated man can expect to realize his best possibilities 
of usefulness without a practical knowledge of the methods of 
experimental science. . . . It is not to be expected or desired 
that many of our students should become professional men of 
science . . . (yet) any system of education is radically defective 
which does not comprise a sufficient training in the methods of 
experimental science to make the mass of our educated men 
familiar with this tool of modern civilization.

of chemistry are so intimately associated with the experiences

of everyday life, and find such important applications in the 
useful arts, that no man at the present day can be regarded as 
educated who is ignorant of them. ... Physical Science has 
become a great power in the world. Indeed, after religion, it 
is the greatest power of our modern civilization. Consider how 
much it has accomplished during the last century toward in- 
creasing the comforts and enlarging the intellectual vision of 
mankind. ... It is frequently said, in defense of the exclusive 
study of the records of ancient learning, that they are the prod- 
uct of thinking, loving, and hating men like ourselves, and it is 
claimed that the study of science can never rise to the same 
nobility because it deals only with lifeless matter. But this is 
a mere play on words, a repetition of the error of the old school- 
men. Physical Science is noble because it does deal with 
thought, and with the very noblest of all thought. ... The 
ancient logic never relieved a moment of pain, or lifted an ounce 
of the burden of human misery. The modern logic has made a 
very large share of material comfort the common heritage of 
all civilized men.” 
Teachers in their zeal for maintaining their stand- 
ards often lose their missionary spirit and act as 
though they would exclude the large majority of 
students from the department of knowledge over 
which they preside. Their love for a particular 
science has overshadowed their love for their fel- 
low men. Such are not true representatives of the 
men of science. 
“No teaching is of any real value that does not come directly 
from the intelligence and heart of the teacher and thus appeal 
to the intelligence and heart of the pupil. ... There is no 
nobler service than the life of a true teacher; but the mere task- 
master has no right to the teacher’s name, and can never attain 
the teacher’s reward. 
“Value scientific studies not simply because they cultivate the 
perception and reasoning faculties, but also because they fill

the mind with lofty ideals, elevated conceptions, and noble 
thoughts. Indeed, I claim that there is no better school in which 
to train the esthetic faculties of the mind, the tastes, and the 
imagination than the study of natural science.” 
The history of science tells of a “multitude who 
have worked in faith for the love of knowledge” and 
“made themselves and their fellows more noble 
men.”

HOW THE PUBLIC WILL SOLVE OUR 
PROBLEMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING? 
In this prognostication I have thought it necessary 
to reénforce my views with the testimony of a score 
of witnesses. I beg leave therefore to act as the 
editor rather than the sole author of this paper. 
Its composite authorship will be found duly set forth 
in the various footnotes. 
In this country we need not fear a revolution in 
matters of education both because democracies are 
proverbially conservative and because educational 
administration is now well organized. Changes are 
therefore sure to be a matter of development and 
growth, and he who would work most effectively 
may prepare for what is before him by studying the 
history of the past and the trend of the present. 
A very casual survey of history reveals the fact 
that education in this country has always been an 
exponent of the times. 
When one considers the changes that have come 
over all educational institutions in the past genera- 
tion, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that 
the public determines what shall be the nature of 
1 Paper read before the Wisconsin State Teachers’ Association,

-P-A-G-E-79
  PROBLEMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING 63 
education. And this seems’ to be equally true 
whether we consider the so-called private or public 
institutions, and whether we consider elementary, 
high-school, or university education. All must be 
largely conventional and partake of the character 
of the times. This fact has been often recognized 
and commented upon both by.those who regret it 
and by those who take satisfaction in it. 
It should be noted that the college community 
is a part of the public and not apart from it. 
I. The public will take greater control of educational 
institutions and the number of pupils will greatly in- 
crease. 
Fifty years ago there were only forty high schools 
in the United States. Now there are about twelve 
thousand. Ten years ago there were about half a 
million high-school pupils and now there are about 
twice that number. The rate of increase in the 
number of pupils naturally is much greater than 
that of buildings or of teachers. A similar state of 
affairs exists in the colleges, universities, and techni- 
cal schools. All this has occurred in spite of the 
attempts of some of the colleges to “put up the 
bar” and deny education to all but a relatively 
few. The methods of selecting those upon whom 
the fruits of education may fall are likely to be re- 
vised by the public, who feel that the money spent 
upon education should make better citizens rather 
than a proletariat. 
It has been shown that the academic methods 
do not select the most efficient candidates.
-P-A-G-E-80
  64 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
It has also been shown that of those who enter 
the high school two-thirds drop out chiefly because 
the instruction is not adapted to their needs.! 
“The real difficulty lies in the lack of adaptation of the in- 
struction in the high schools to the need and opportunities of 
the pupils.... The instruction should be made as far 
as possible to serve the needs of the great mass of the pupils. 
The high school (as now administered) is essentially 
a ‘select’ school . . . the real and imperative needs of the many 
are sacrificed to the doubtful satisfaction of the needs of the 
few . . . what the whole system requires is the skillful provision 
for the real good of the greatest number.” 2 
Dr. Edward J. Goodwin, President of Packer 
Institute and recently Assistant Commissioner of 
Education of the State of New York, as quoted in 
the New York Times for October 25, 1908, says: 
“We are gradually coming to recognize the injustice of organ- 
izing our high schools in the interests of the few alone. Our high 
schools contribute in New York for example less than 2 per cent 
of the men who yearly enter the so-called ‘ unlearned’ pro- 
fessions.” 
It is inevitable that all educational institutions 
will become much more crowded in the near future, 
for the public is moving toward a greater control 
of the schools and colleges; and a still further 
increase of attendance upon our schools and colleges 
will forthwith compel us to make some modifications 
in our methods of instruction, so as to deal with 
larger numbers of pupils. For instance, it will

make it difficult to talk seriously of “laboratory 
divisions limited to twelve.” 
“The real voice of the voters who have lately so multiplied 
high schools has not yet been clearly heard, and their unfor- 
mulated purpose has not yet been accomplished. . . . The evils 
of college dominance are now so great and manifest that they 
must be transient.” ! 
“The people know what they mean by education after all 
really quite as accurately as we do, whose peculiar business it is 
to define the term.” 2 
The conditions of our modern life are driving 
every one to the study of science. Evening classes, 
extension classes, correspondence classes, are mul- 
tiplying. Books and periodicals give increasing 
space to scientific subjects The development 
of machinery has made the study of physics not 
only a matter of interest but a necessity to all 
persons. The automobile, the motor boat, and the 
like are not only rivals of the schools in the 
teaching of physics but they are at the same time 
the most potent cause for the reform in that 
teaching. ‘ 
From Sir Humphry Davy, whose inaugural ad- 
dress at the Royal Institution sets forth the serv- 
ices of science to humanity and science as an agent 
in the improvement of society, through the long 
line of masters down to the present, there comes a 
complete and overwhelming condemnation of Caven- 
dish’s exclusiveness in science.

  66 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
“The subject matter of physics is far more closely connected 
than that of any other science with daily life . . . the things 
we need to know most are the physical things . . . there is no 
other science except chemistry, which touches common life at 
so many points.” ! 
Il. The public will no doubt require that science instruc- 
tion shall be practical, or as Professor Bailey puts it — 
applicable. 
Unless it is applicable it can neither be scientific 
nor humanistic. 
The high schools of the future will without doubt 
be more closely allied to schools of applied science 
than to those of pure science. There will be more 
of the study of processes than of principles; more 
of physiology than of anatomy; more of agriculture, 
nature study, natural philosophy as Faraday under- 
stood it, than of physics and chemistry as the terms 
are now sometimes understood. 
Faraday thought that physical science was a 
most appropriate study for children and mentioned 
light as a particularly good subject for that purpose. 
Professor William Conger Morgan of the Uni- 
versity of California has an article in School Science 
for November, 1908, on the “Relation of the Techni- 
cal World to School Chemistry,” in which he shows 
admirably how the high-school course in chemistry 
might: be enriched, and he completely justifies the 
substitution of “practical” illustrations for the 
usual academic treatment when he says:

  PROBLEMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING 67 
“The best reason for introducing experiments from the indus- 
trial world is to illustrate the general principles of chemistry.” 
This is not materializing or commercializing; 
it is the most effective way of teaching science 
for its own sake. 
But let us put special emphasis upon the next 
division of our subject. 
III. Science teaching will be more humanized. 
“Nothing is of real worth unless it can be directly connected 
with some result of conspicuous benefit to mankind. 
“This attitude has profoundly influenced educational theory. 
This is a change of attitude of the world at large. 
“Society wants the things of practical moment taught, and 
it is the task of education to do it. 
“Science has the confidence of the people, before whose court 
it must justify itself. Science teaching has every natural ad- 
vantage in its favor, including the keen interest of the pupil, 
and no excuse will be accepted for its failure. 
“Science teaching has its mission in general education. It 
may be taught so that it throws light on almost every phase of 
human interest. 
“The lives of the great scientists are just as significant for 
education as the things which they stand for. The more students 
learn about personality the larger men they become.” ! 
“Tt is gradually becoming clear that for purpose of teaching, 
science must be treated as a part of human experience. It must 
be so closely linked with the interests and problems of the daily 
life as to become part of it. It must be shown to have arisen 
for the purpose of meeting human needs and to have played a 
very important part in the development of our present social 
life.” 2

ber, 1908.

68 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
“The call to life, and to life in this world, is the first and 
fundamental call of the scientific age, it is a call to sacrifice 
and to service, and the call to service has been the deepening 
undertone of the call to humanism.” ! 
IV. The status of the high-school teacher will be greatly 
improved and we may hope that great teachers will 
arise as of yore. 
If we are to meet the needs of the public, we must 
again have great teachers. 
“The great teacher is the man of great personality, in whom 
nobility means more than attainments, and therefore the man 
whose personal touch upon the student is sure to be quickening 
and ennobling. He must know surely and clearly the subject 
he is teaching, but he must know even more profoundly and 
sympathetically the object he is teaching, namely, the other 
human beings, his pupils, for whom he is guide and leader. 
“The greatest students of this world have been formed one 
by one by great masters. 
“Give me a good teacher, of noble nature, and I am compara- 
tively indifferent to his or her scholarly attainments. The at- 
tainments will follow. Of what use for educating our boys and 
girls would it be to have the most gifted if that teacher is him- 
self a small-natured, mean-natured, close-natured, little-natured, 
soul ?”” 2 
“The educational process is not the mechanical impact of 
text-book or even of ideas upon the intellect, but the impact 
between living beings; and in the interaction of these vastly 
more is given and received than is ever formulated. What 
the teacher is expresses itself; and always the teacher’s person- 
ality is the greatest educational influence.” *

  PROBLEMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING 69 
The high-school age is the most important for 
education, and the public will there place its greatest 
teachers. They cannot be specialists, for as intelli- 
gence increases in one direction ignorance becomes 
more dense in other directions. The specialist 
seldom measures up to the average intelligence of 
his own pupils. 
The greatest teachers of the future, like the great 
teachers of the past, will teach not one but many 
sciences and these with reference to their appli- 
cations. 
“A generation ago. . . the work was usually in the hands of 
one of those admirable all-round pedagogues who were capable 
of teaching with equal facility every subject in the curriculum ; 
and it may be said in homage to their talent that the best of them 
taught every subject as well perhaps as some of the specialists 
of to-day teach the one subject to which all their time is given.” ! 
“And we all praise famous men — 
Ancients of the College; 
For they taught us common sense — 
Tried to teach us common sense 
Truth and God’s Own Common Sense 
Which is more than knowledge.” 2 
“A well-rounded mind rather than the mind of one idea is 
the general purpose of teaching.” ® 
Teaching is a “high and sacred calling” and we 
might expect it to react upon the personality of the 
teacher. 
An Englishman writing of his visits to American 
schools says :

  70 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
“T have found teachers the most attractive class in the nation, 
because more than any other class, not excepting the clergy, they 
are free from sordid aims.” 1 
We may expect that such teachers will maintain 
sympathetic relations with their pupils. 
At present teachers appear to be divided into two 
camps with reference to their mode of treating the 
pupils. One party feels that there can be no edu- 
cation without coercion, the other feels that it is 
possible to win students to voluntary efforts which 
shall count for more. The first party accuses the 
second of using “kindergarten methods” and of 
entertaining and interesting pupils until they lose 
the capacity for work. Work, they claim, is their 
watchword, and play, they claim, is the watchword 
of the second party. But the second party has 
never agreed to this claim. On the other hand, it 
says to the first. party, you boast of work but you 
really administer sedatives. Your quantitative 
laboratory exercises. and your mathematical treat- 
ment of physics is not hard, it is stupid. Its only 
justification is that it is the easiest thing for an 
overworked teacher to administer, particularly if 
he be a teacher who lacks the power to hold the 
attention of a class and therefore dreads qualitative 
experiments. Furthermore the second party claims 
that it secures a compelling interest in the subject 
which insures voluntary effort not only in school, 
but out of school, and through life. These two 
parties have never been able to get together by argu- 
ment, and I take it that it is a hopeless case of lack 
1 Educational Review, October, 1908, p. 295.
-P-A-G-E-87
  PROBLEMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING 71 
of affinity. Unless I am greatly mistaken, these 
two parties in education would also be found to be 
two opposite sects in religion and for similar reasons. 
The first requisite of a great teacher is that he retain a 
vivid recollection of himself as a child, that he may 
be able to appreciate fully the pupil’s point of view. 
V. As the high-school teacher increases in dignity the 
domination of the college will cease and the evils of uni- 
formity will disappear. 
“High school physics has problems all its own to which its 
representatives should address themselves with courage, resolu- 
tion, and above all with independence, or else the present deca- 
dent tendencies due to college control will continue. 
“College entrance requirements as now enforced are almost an 
unmitigated curse to the high schools, exploiting them against 
their normal interests and the purpose of the people who support 
them. 
“The high school should be master not servant. 
“Perhaps no institution in modern times needs inspection, 
visitation, and scrutiny so much as the private endowed 
American colleges themselves.” 1 
We can never have a truly educational treatment 
of any subject so long as it is studied solely with 
college entrance examinations in view. 
In England and on the continent entrance exami- 
nations have been abolished on the ground that they 
are no test for power. 
“The function of secondary schools is distinct in itself and 
will one day establish its independent right when it has rid 
itself of the vicious term and still more vicious idea of college 
preparation.” ?

  12 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
The high-school teachers of this country have 
their subject matter and method of treatment 
minutely prescribed for them by those who under- 
stand neither the subject nor the pupils as well as 
they do. 
Some persons, unconscious that physics is a liv- 
ing subject, that every man, woman, and child has 
his own physical world to study, varying with per- 
sons and with localities, demand that these high- 
school pupils shall be fitted to the Procrustean bed. 
They assert that physics is a quantitative subject ; 
that it presents the greatest difficulty to all except 
those few who have special gifts. They say that 
this is predetermined in the nature of the subject. 
All this, however, has been explicitly denied by some 
of the greatest natural philosophers and the greatest 
educational philosophers. 
In the hands of the great teachers few subjects 
are difficult; in the hands of some teachers all sub- 
jects are not only difficult, but utterly incompre- 
hensible. 
“Any of the Sciences can be made impressive if 
taught by a full mind which alone can elementarize,” ! 
and the ability to simplify is one of the marks of true 
greatness. 
“We must distinguish between the teaching function and the 
research function. It is our business as teachers to open the 
minds of the young to the facts of science... . Nature study 
is not a new subject; it is a new mode of teaching and is just as 
applicable to the college as to the common school.” ?

PROBLEMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING 73 
“The craze for uniformity more than any other one thing 
has led to the great success of our schools in the development of 
mediocrity.” ! 
“Even more harmful than overcrowding is the over-system- 
atizing which characterizes our present-day methods. The tend- 
ency nearly everywhere is to reduce teaching to a routine and 
thus to deprive both teacher and pupil of the chance to do and 
think for themselves. A committee is appointed to draw up a 
syllabus and to outline the Physics teaching for a whole state 
or for the entire country. Every school equips itself to follow 
this program, and every Physics teacher goes through the pre- 
scribed course in the prescribed manner with section after sec- 
tion, day after day and year after year, until Physics to him, 
instead of being the world-wide glorious science that it really 
is, is comprised within the scanty pages of the syllabus. Some 
spirits there are that refuse to be thus confined, but the tend- 
ency to uniformity levels down as well as up and the hilltops 
from which one may look out and view the true beauties of 
science are cut down in order that we may have a plain, easily 
traversed and easily cultivated.” ? 
“The interests and needs of the pupils should be the deter- 
mining factor in the arrangement of courses and the choice of 
methods. 
“Tt follows that a high degree of uniformity in teaching physics 
is neither practicable nor desirable. 
“Physics should be taught not as a preparation for college but 
as a preparation for life.” *

  4 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
VI. As attendance upon the high-school classes in science 
increases, individual laboratory work will of necessity 
be somewhat curtailed and more importance will be 
attached to the lecture. 
To begin with, the so-called inductive work will 
be eliminated from the laboratory. 
High-school pupils are sometimes taught to “test” 
and to “verify,” in short to learn things “first 
hand” when they have neither capacity for nor 
ground upon which to draw conclusions. 
“T am an enemy of the inductive method in the school course. 
It is utterly absurd to expect an immature boy of fifteen or six- 
teen to perform that intellectual feat of generalization that is 
considered the most mature effort of the human mind... . 
It is supposing a mental endowment that only comes late in life 
to most of us and often never at all... . Bad as this method 
is in the hands of an experienced teacher it is confusion worse 
confounded when a novice attempts it.” 1 
The laboratory at best is a very artificial means of 
supplying experiences upon which to build physical 
concepts. While it is useful and needful it cannot 
take the place of an appeal to life’s experiences 
and the phenomena of nature. The charge that 
pupils may read about nature in books and not 
recognize her out of doors is quite as applicable to 
laboratory work. In physics it is too unreal; too 
much devoted to statics—too many things are 
presented which are never found outside of a labor- 
atory and which are not parallel to or explanatory 
of anything found in ordinary human experience.

Teachers, December, 1905, p. 25.

PROBLEMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING 15 
Professor Mann, Chicago, says that “for the gen- 
eral student college laboratory work is neither essen- 
tial nor desirable.” + 
“Too much time is given to so-called laboratory work with 
elaborate and expensive apparatus. Too little attention is paid 
to simple and effective illustrations of physical phenomena and 
simple applications of fundamental principles to be found in 
every school room and its immediate environments.” ? 
Professor W. S. Franklin, Lehigh, says : 
“My experience is most emphatically, that a student may 
measure a thing and know nothing at all about it, and I believe 
that the present high-school courses in elementary physics in 
which quantitative laboratory work is so strongly emphasized, 
are altogether bad.” Me. 
“T believe that the physical sciences should be taught in the 
secondary schools with reference to their practical applications. 
I cannot endure a so-called knowledge of elementary science 
which does not relate to some actual physical condition or thing, 
and I believe that the only physical things that are sufficiently 
prominent in a young man’s mind to be brought into the field 
of his science study are the things which have been impressed 
upon him in everyday life. Say what you will, you must do 
one of two things to be able to teach physics in any school; 
either you must create an actual world of the unusual phenom- 
ena of nature by purchasing an elaborate and expensive equip- 
ment of scientific apparatus or you must make use of the boy’s 
everyday world of actual conditions and things.” * 
The public has expended lavishly for laboratory 
equipment in physics, doubtless in the expectation

that their children, will be better instructed thereby 
to cope with the new conditions of modern life. 
There is no department of education which the 
people have more at heart and there are abundant 
signs that they will not long permit their purposes 
to be thwarted. 
Education is not wholly a process of training. It 
is in considerable measure a matter of acquiring 
the mass of information which it is conventional 
to have at any particular age. 
The lecture is the only means by which we may 
bring in all the good things that we feel moved to 
introduce. The great teachers of the future will 
be able to instruct large classes by “talks, which is 
the method of the real teacher.” This is to-day the 
method of the German teachers, who are notoriously 
the best teachers in the world. 
Large portions of science should be merely touched 
upon; made understandable for a brief moment 
and then forgotten, not even retained for recitation, 
much less for examination. 
“Curiosity and interest are generally the first outcrop of 
intellectual ability. Youth is normally greedy for knowledge 
and that, not in one but in many directions. 
“Never is the power to appreciate so far ahead of the power 
to express and never does understanding so outstrip ability to 
explain. Over accuracy is atrophy. Mental acquisition sinks 
too deep to be reproduced by examination. With pedagogic 
tact we can teach about everything we know that is really 
worth knowing, but if we amplify and moralize instead of 
giving great wholes — if we wait before each methodic step till 
the pupil has reproduced all the last we starve and retard the 
soul.
-P-A-G-E-93
  PROBLEMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING Vi. 
“The nature of youth demands that science should be taught 
in a large all-comprehensive way. We must have an introduc- 
tion to science that touches rather lightly on nearly all the great 
hypotheses over the whole field. 
“The boy in his teens needs great wholes, facts in profusion, 
but few formule. He has a native gravity toward those frontier 
questions where even the great masters know as little as he. 
“The college should stand for extensive more than for inten- 
sive study. 
“Tt should stand with doors hospitably open to those who 
have time to pause for it on the road to a profession, or to spend a 
period of culture and acquire an avocation before entering a 
career. It should let teaching have its perfect work. 
“The teacher should forage widely and incessantly, and bring 
everything within reach in his field to his class. The lecture 
method should be made the most of, being conversational and 
designed to provoke reactions. He should teach every topic 
broadly and comprehensively, and instead of disparaging mere 
information, it should ooze from his every pore. 
“Every great expert should feel it his duty to put the best 
that is in him in a form most interesting and profitable to a 
cultured lay audience.” 1 
The lecture room is the place for presenting the 
history of science and the biography of scientists ; 
the story of inventions and how they have trans- 
formed society; the rise and development of modern 
scientific theories; the linking of the history of 
science with general history showing how the evolu- 
tion of science was both helped and handicapped ; 
the contributions of science to our comfort, our 
health, and our general happiness. 
Mr. B. M. Jaquish of Erasmus Hall High School, 
Brooklyn, New York, in an unpublished paper 
has very effectually shown that countless references

  18 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
in all our literature require for their interpretation 
a general knowledge of science and this is rapidly 
becoming a sine qua non for current literature. 
The lecture should show the application of science 
in the occupations of the particular community 
in which the school happens to be located. 
Hence no syllabus can be made to fit the whole 
country. If the school is in a large city and is 
located in one of our most modernly equipped build- 
ings the lecture in physics will often be devoted to 
an explanation of that equipment which will be 
found to illustrate every chapter in physics far 
better than any laboratory can. 
VII. We may undertake to frame a platform for future 
science teaching as follows: 
1. Science for high schools consists of a well-organ- 
ized mass of useful information. 
2. In order that the amount of information may be 
considerable it is given for the most part 
“second hand.” 
8. The three means for giving this information, 
stating the more important first, are: (a) 
Illustrated lectures. (b) Study of text-book 
with recitations, and reading many references 
in books and magazines with written and 
oral reports. (c) Laboratory work, a small 
portion of which consists of exact measure- 
ments. 
4. This mass of useful information being acquired 
at the hand of a competent teacher involves 
discipline and training.
-P-A-G-E-95
  
PROBLEMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING — 79 
5. While the science teacher has a peculiar part 
to perform in the process of education which 
the teacher of no other subject can do so 
well, his task is not absolutely unique and 
the methods of instruction which are best 
in the treatment of other subjects are for 
the most part best for science. 
6. A quantitative treatment with whole numbers, 
so to speak, runs through much of the in- 
struction in lectures, recitations, and labor- 
atory work — giving concreteness and there- 
fore interest to the subject — but this is 
only incidental and of minor importance. 
7. Science is not presented as a catalogue of. prin- 
ciples, but rather as history, biography, and 
the evolution of changing ideas. The topics 
for study are phenomena rather than laws, 
and principles are presented only for the 
purpose of explaining some definite problems 
in life. 
8. Since all this applies equally to all general or first 
courses, whether given in high schools or 
colleges, it follows that college admission tests 
are the same as high-school graduation tests.!

  80 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
After full discussion the Science Conference 
unanimously passed the following preamble and 
resolution : 
Whereas: The present methods of teaching 
physics in secondary schools do not yield as satis- 
factory results as we desire to get; and, 
Whereas: We believe this to be due to the fact 
that far too great emphasis is now placed on accurate 
quantitative work; and, 
Whereas: This overemphasis of the importance 
of quantitative work is due to the fact that some 
colleges take the position that physics is by nature 
a quantitative science, that it is the only such sub- 
ject in the high-school curriculum, and that it must 
therefore be so taught, irrespective of the needs 
and abilities of the pupils; and, 
Whereas: We believe that physics for high schools 
should consist of a study of the processes and prin- 
ciples of phenomena of the daily life of the student ; 
therefore be it 
Resolved: That we, members of the Science Con- 
ference of the Wisconsin State Teachers’ Associa- 
tion, in convention assembled, do hereby agree 
to change the methods of teaching physics by 
abandoning as far as may be found desirable the 
exact quantitative work, and by substituting there- 
for a more living treatment of the subject based 
on the daily experiences of the pupils. 
The following resolutions were passed by the 
Central Association of Science and Mathematics 
Teachers at its meeting in Chicago, November 28, 
1908 :

Resolved: That we believe in the recognition and 
inclusion within our courses of the practical and 
applied aspects that make possible an appreciable 
significance and belief in the worthwhileness in 
practical life of the various subjects studied; and 
Resolved: That we believe that the formulation 
of secondary school courses should be made entirely 
from the point of view of the needs of the majority 
of secondary school pupils, and further that any 
course that is best for the majority of the secondary 
school pupils is best for college entrance.

THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 
GiveEN a class all the members of which are the 
same age, all having taken the same previous 
studies, all having the same standing, and all good 
in mathematics, they will still be found to be widely 
different in their capacity to understand physics. 
The difference among them lies not in their mental 
caliber, but in the experiences they may have had, 
or rather in the attention they may have paid to 
their experiences. There are high-school pupils 
who have had no conscious experience that would 
lead them to think that they could secure a me- 
chanical advantage by taking hold of the long arm 
of a lever. Such pupils often go through the usual 
quantitative experiments in the laboratory as though 
they were exercises in pure mathematics. The ex- 
periments seem to add nothing to the pupils’ physical 
sense. They are no more likely to feel that they 
could move a log better by taking hold of the end 
than by seizing it in the middle; they see no reason 
why a heavy object may be rolled up a gradual incline 
more easily than up a steep one, or, for that matter, 
why it would not be better to lift it without an in- 
clined plane. They have no instinct, when walking 
by the side of a railroad track, which would lead them 
82
-P-A-G-E-99
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 83 
to prefer tHe inside rather than the outside of a 
curve when a train is coming. They see no reason 
why a river should gouge the outer rather than the 
inner bank on its winding course. They see no 
reason why a propeller wheel should cause an airship 
to move. It is not to them self-evident that if 
rapidly moving air knocks a building over the 
air must have weight. If when looking obliquely 
upon the surface of a quiet lake they see a bright 
star reflected therein, they do not know by experi- 
ence where to look for the star itself. These are 
not rare cases. A majority of the students who 
come to the study of physics feel that a large por- 
tion of the common everyday material phenomena 
is “uncanny.” The first purpose of a beginning 
course in physics, whether in grammar school, high 
school, or college, should be to make nature and her 
ways seem natural. It matters little whether we 
call it nature-study, phenomenology, or physics 
(all of which terms are in reality synonymous as 
applied to elementary work); we must lay the 
foundation for an understanding of our subject by 
furnishing a basis of experience, comparing observa- 
tion with observation, lighting one fact with another. 
This does not necessarily mean laboratory work, 
although that may be made a most fruitful aid. 
It would seem self-evident that the first thing 
one must do is to find out the exact mental equip- 
ment of his students — to find out what the founda- 
tion is before he begins to build upon it. But 
the schools are full of persons just out of college, 
teaching not the pupils, but their own self-respect-
-P-A-G-E-100
  84 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
ing course in physics. These straightway reach 
the conclusion that few students are fit to take 
physics. 
The writer believes that there is nothing in the 
nature of physics nor in the nature of either grammar- 
school or high-school pupils which precludes their 
studying physics; on the other hand, it would seem 
evident that the subject is peculiarly well suited 
to fit them for life. This view seems to be generally 
accepted by the public and most children seem to 
have the desire for a knowledge of things physical 
so strongly implanted in them that they will study 
the subject after a fashion in spite of the delinquencies 
of the schools. No distaste for the physics of the 
schoolmaster has in the slightest degree affected 
their love for the physics of everyday life. 
The first requisite of a high-school teacher of 
physical science is that he should have that grasp 
of his subject and that understanding of pupils 
that would enable him to teach his subject with 
equal facility to any and all persons from twelve 
to eighteen years of age. 
Apparently not more than 5 or 6 per cent of all 
the high schools in the United States have a suffi- 
cient number of teachers so that one may give his 
whole attention to physical science, including physics 
and chemistry, and not more than 2 or 8 per cent 
have teachers who may specialize between physics 
and chemistry. This does not appear to be a mis- 
fortune. A rather careful and extended investiga- 
tion of the matter has brought me to the conclusion 
that the best teachers of any science are those who
-P-A-G-E-101
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 85 
are fairly well trained in all, rather than those who 
have had training in one science only. The high- 
school teacher of physical science needs at least a 
general college course of one year’s duration in each 
of the following: physics, chemistry, and biology. 
It is desirable that he have a second year’s course 
in each of the first two. But it is of the utmost 
importance that these courses be given him by a 
model teacher and that he be associated with those 
who are looking forward to teaching rather than to 
research. He should have also a course in the his- 
tory of physical science and in the teaching of the 
same. He should gain a knowledge of the modern 
trend of teaching in his field by a study of the 
papers read at educational meetings and discussions 
published in educational journals during the past 
fifteen years. He should read the prefaces of a 
dozen or more of the high-school text-books in 
physical science. These have been written for the 
most part by the most successful teachers of the 
time, selected by rather astute publishing houses 
who keep a close watch upon the field and generally 
know what is most likely to meet the demand. 
Each author in his preface has attempted to state 
what are his ideals. To read these prefaces and to 
scan through the texts is one of the best ways to dis- 
cover what are the aims and tendencies of the 
teaching of physical science for any period. And 
a clear understanding of the trend of the immedi- 
ate past will enable one to predict what will be the 
practice of the near future. 
The intending teacher should be. familiar with

the various syllabuses put forth in his subjects and 
the examination questions upon his subjects which 
have been given high-school graduates for the past 
few years. These will indicate the scope of the 
subject as it is in the mind of some of those who are 
in a position to direct the teaching of physics. 
Visits to schools, inspection of equipment, and talks 
with teachers are a necessary part of the education 
of the intending teacher. The reports of city and 
state superintendents often contain very instructive 
matter for intending teachers. 
During the college course most young men suffer 
a complete intellectual revolution. Senior conserva- 
tism takes the place of freshman enthusiasm, but it 
is still counterfeit. Their excesses are quite as great, 
but they are of a negative kind. Finding that much 
which they had affirmed is untenable, they now 
deny everything. Being unable longer to believe 
all things, they disbelieve all things. If they have 
chosen science as their major study, they affect to 
discount all other subjects of study. They some- 
times show contempt for poetry, art, music, litera- 
ture, philosophy, religion, women, and people in 
general outside of their department. Their elders, 
thinking that all this is merely a phase of adoles- 
cence, are more or less complacent about it, but 
I cannot feel that they are yet suitable material 
for high-school teachers. There is still a capacity 
for worship in them, and it is directed toward science 
and the great scientists. Like most worshipers, 
they conceive their gods to be like themselves, and 
it is a very great and wholesome eye-opener to them
-P-A-G-E-103
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 87 
to learn that Faraday, Maxwell, and a host of other 
masters of science have been devoted to religion, 
that Davy, Maxwell, and many others living and 
dead have been poets, artists, musicians, philos- 
ophers, husbands, fathers, and even men of the world. 
It is a distinct shock to the youthful specialist 
of to-day to learn that none of the great scientists 
have been specialists in early life. On the con- 
trary, their interests often seem to have been par- 
ticularly diffuse. Poetical imagination rather than 
mathematics seems to have been a conspicuous 
foundation in many of them.- Huxley was a great 
reader of novels, and Simon Newcomb wrote one. 
It is well that a young man before he goes into 
high-school teaching should get over his cant about 
scientific accuracy and truthfulness, and learn that 
the physicists are no better and no worse than other 
people, no more accurate and no more reliable in 
their judgments when outside of their particular 
field. A man trained to scientific conservatism in 
one subject may be a wildcat in some other. 
If one would really know what is the condition 
of things at the present time in which he is living 
and what is to be the condition of things in the 
near future, for which he should prepare to live, 
let him regard more than the ephemeris of to-day. 
He should study the trend of the recent past and 
thus divine both the true present and the near 
future. Let us see what authors of text-books and 
other persons who have commanded more or less 
attention have to say about vitalizing the teaching 
of physics by the use of practical applications and   
 
-P-A-G-E-104

interpretations of the phenomena of everyday life; 
about the use of the inductive method; about the 
infusion of mathematics into physics; about quanti- 
tative work; about lectures; about simplification 
of the subject and of the apparatus. 
In 1857, in the preface of his Natural Philosophy, 
Wells wrote: | 
“The principles of physical science are so intimately con- 
nected with the arts and occupations of everyday life, with our 
very existence and continuance as sentient beings, that public 
opinion at the present time imperatively demands that the course 
of instruction in this subject shall be as full, thorough, and com- 
plete as opportunity and time will permit. The author has en- 
deavored to render the work eminently practical, the illustrations 
and examples have been derived, in most cases, from familiar 
and common objects.” 
Of the fifty or more high-school texts which have 
been written during the past fifty years, there is 
scarcely one that has not reiterated this sentiment 
in its preface. When, however, we come to look 
into the body of the text we are invariably disap- 
pointed. Those who have written during the last 
fifteen years have noticeably been circumscribed 
in this matter. Wells under the head of ‘Strength 
of Materials” gives an interesting and illuminating 
account covering eight pages. Hollow bones of 
animals, hollow stalks of grains, and hollow columns 
in buildings are discussed among other interesting 
things. Within the last fifteen or twenty years, how- 
ever, the exigencies of college preparation have sub- 
stituted for all this a laboratory exercise in which each 
pupil attempts to find the number of grams required
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 89 
to break a piece of small wire. We certainly need 
common-sense instruction about strength of ma- 
terial. Many a man has stripped the screw thread 
from some fine piece of apparatus before he learned 
that brass was a softer metal than steel and could 
not be safely handled with a monkey wrench. To 
many persons all metals are hard and strong and 
able to stand any abuse, until they have learned to 
the contrary by some unnecessarily bitter experi- 
ence. Certainly whatever we may profess in the 
prefaces of our text-books, we are actually doing 
less in our schools to-day than we did fifty years 
ago to make sciences minister to the needs of our 
common life. The fact that it requires a pull of 
a certain number of grams to break a piece of No. 
24 brass wire is of no concern to any of us — not 
even to the bridge builder. It would seem that 
laboratory teachers, like kindergarten folks, have 
been at much pains to invent “busy work.” 
Previous to 1870 there was much in the way of 
“philosophical apparatus” in the schools, and in 
the hands of many a skillful demonstrator and true 
teacher it served admirably to make knowledge 
real. As early as 1837 the city of Boston furnished 
each of its grammar schools with a set of physical 
apparatus costing $275 for each set. A similar 
set was to be found in most of the academies of the 
country about that time, and there are a large 
number of persons now living who are both capable 
and willing to testify that they received more that 
was worth while from the instruction given with 
the aid of that apparatus than our high schools of

to-day are giving under the college entrance require- 
ments. 
Between 1870 and 1880, much was said about 
the value of individual laboratory work and the use 
of the inductive method. In 1872 Eliot and Storer 
in the preface to their Elementary Manual of Chem- 
istry wrote: 
“The authors’ object is to facilitate the teaching of chemistry 
by the experimental and inductive method, to develop and disci- 
pline the observing faculties.” 
Storer and Lindsley somewhat later said : 
“The student acquaints himself with facts and principles 
through attentive use of his own perceptive faculties.” 
From 1873 to 1878, Steele wrote in his prefaces 
to books on chemistry and physics : 
“Unusual importance is given to that practical part of chemi- 
cal knowledge which concerns our everyday life.” “A closer 
relation between school room, kitchen, farm, and shop.” “The 
author has used simple language and practical illustrations 
(and the student) is at once led out into real life. From the 
multitude of principles, only those have been selected which 
are essential to the information of every well-read person.” 
“Aim to lead young persons to become lovers and interpreters 
of nature.” ‘Simple experiments within the reach of every 
pupil at home.” “The text-book only introduces the student 
to a subject which he should seek every opportunity to pursue.” 
“As far as possible every question and principle should be sub- 
mitted to nature for a direct answer by means of an experiment.” 
And in no other books have I found the text ful- 
filling so completely the promise of the preface, as 
in his.
-P-A-G-E-107
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 91 
In 1881, Avery’s Chemistry said: ‘ As far as possi- 
ble the experiments are to be performed by the pupil 
rather than for him.” In 1882, Gage’s Physics had 
stamped upon the cover “Read nature in the lan- 
guage of experiment.” The preface quotes from 
Superintendent Seaver of Boston: 
“The mind gains a real and adequate knowledge of things 
only in the presence of the things themselves.” 
Gage remarks that chemistry has been taught 
by the laboratory method for twenty years, and 
urges the introduction of laboratory work in physics. 
In the English High School in Boston, he had with 
$300 furnished a laboratory which answered the 
requirements of a large school. He proposes fifteen 
as the size of a laboratory class and five experi- 
ments in an hour — twelve minutes to an experi- 
ment including the writing of the notes upon the 
same. Gage stood for greatly simplified apparatus. 
“Laboratory practice and didactic study should go hand in 
hand, and divide the time with one another about equally.” ‘So 
far as practicable, experiments precede the statements of defini- 
tions and laws, and the latter are not given until the pupil is 
prepared, by previous observation and discussion, to frame them 
for himself.” 
Trowbridge, head of the Department of Physics at 
Harvard, in his high-school text-book in 1884 said : 
“The writer believes that the necessary amount of geometry 
and trigonometry (for the study of physics) can be taught at 
about one sitting.” 
“Tt is necessary for the student of science to obtain a certain 
balance of judgment, and to cultivate a certain scientific in- 
stinct.”
-P-A-G-E-108
  92 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
“Physics should not be made a means of teaching mathe- 
matics. I have, therefore, substituted experimental problems 
for the mathematical problems which are usually given in 
treatises on natural philosophy, in the hope of cultivating the 
scientific instinct.” 
“The natural progress of our study of any subject is from the 
qualitative, or the comparatively rough evidence of our senses, 
to the quantitative.” 
“The author recommends that from one to two lectures be 
given during the week. . In these lectures the experiment should 
be performed which the students afterward perform themselves 
in the laboratory.” 
Hall and Bergen, 1891: 
Previous to 1886 candidates for entrance to the 
freshman class at Harvard had been examined on 
text-book work only. In this year a laboratory 
requirement was added. 
“An attempt was made to bring together such experiments as 
would have the most frequent and important application in 
ordinary life.” 
Hall and Bergen, revised and enlarged edition, 
1897: 
“The instruction should direct especial attention to the illus- 
trations and applications of physical laws to be found in every- 
day life.” 
“The pupils’ laboratory work should give practice in the ob- 
servation and explanation of physical phenomena.” 
Hall suggests simple apparatus. He proposes 
about $1000 to equip a laboratory with apparatus 
for twelve workers and for teachers’ demonstrations. 
Carhart and Chute, 1892: 
“The laboratory method has come in during the past decade.”
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 93 
They describe very clearly how the inductive method 
or the attempt at it results in failure. 
“‘A few years ago it seemed necessary to urge upon teachers 
the adoption of laboratory methods to illustrate the text-book ; 
in not a few instances it would now seem almost necessary to 
urge the use of a text-book to render intelligible the chaotic 
work of the laboratory.” 
“The pupil should be kept in his class-work well ahead of 
the subjects forming the basis of his laboratory experiments.” 
Avery, 1895: 
“The class-room work must be kept ahead of the laboratory 
work; 7.e., the pupil must come to the laboratory with some 
knowledge of the principles involved in the work that he is re- 
quired to perform.” 
He does not appear to think that high-school pu- 
pils can work by the inductive method. 
Cooley, 1897: 
“The student should study the text-book before entering the 
laboratory.” 
The order recommended is : 
“(1) Oral instruction — involving illustrative experiments. 
(2) The study of a text-book. (3) Laboratory work to practice 
experimental methods of reaching or testing truth.” 
Crew, 1899: 
“Physics, in too many of our schools, ranks as a most difficult 
subject. But dealing, as it does, with the familiar phenomena 
of daily life, and requiring, as it does, only a small fraction of the 
algebraic knowledge which the average student has already ac- 
quired, the author is inclined to believe that the difficulty lies 
chiefly in the presentation.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  94 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
“An elementary presentation of physics should begin by 
resuming what might be called the experience of the average 
lad of sixteen years. The number of physical facts which a boy 
of this age has accumulated is astounding. Seldom, indeed, 
does the instructor appeal to him in vain for a verification of an 
elementary fact. The demand therefore is not so much for new 
facts, or for sheer facts of any kind, as for an orderly arrange- 
ment and an ability to use these facts.” 
Hortvet, 1899: 
“Tt is found in practice that the purely inductive method fails 
at points where it is expected to do the greatest amount of 
good.” 
Torrey, Chemistry, 1899: 
“Chemistry has suffered from the irrepressible wave of labora- 
tory madness which has swept over the whole educational world.” 
“Nothing too severe can be said against the mechanical and 
demoralizing system of note-books with ‘operation,’ ‘ observa- 
tion,’ and ‘inference’ headings. They are wholesale breeders of 
dishonest and superficial work.” 
Thwing, 1900: 
“Laboratory work should follow the study of text.” 
Henderson and Woodhull, 1900: 
“Physics should be so taught as to be a desirable and even 
essential subject for every pupil in the secondary schools.” 
“The relations of physics on all sides to human life and human 
interests have been emphasized.” 
“The laboratory deals with inductions and verifications, and 
its chief purpose is to make knowledge real.” 
“Both laboratory and classroom work are essential to a cor- 
rect knowledge of elementary physics, and they should correlate.” 
“Portraits and brief sketches of men who, by their researches, 
have contributed much to our knowledge of physics have been 
introduced.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 95 
Slate, 1902: 
““My experience proves beyond reasonable doubt that elemen- 
tary instruction in physics suffers where contact with phenomena 
and with experimental methods is confined to a small group of 
quantitative experiments; the possibilities of the class (lecture ?) 
experiment have not been fully exploited.” 
“Tnstead of feeding them with crumbs from the specialists’ 
table, physics for the school must be treated in relation to the 
average boy and girl, approaching the threshold of active life.” 
Holden, The Sciences, 1902 : 
“Main object, to help the child to understand the material 
world about him. Why should not natural phenomena be com- 
prehended by the child?” 
“Ttis not possible to explain every detail of a locomotive, but 
it is perfectly practicable to explain its general principles.” 
“The plan is to waken the imagination; to convey useful 
knowledge; excite a living and lasting interest in the world that 
lies about us.” 
“Familiar phenomena are referred to their fundamental 
causes.” 
Andrews and Howland, 1903: 
“We have sought to make prominent the practical bearings of 
physics. To those students at least whose schooling ends with 
the high school, physics should be a connecting link between their 
study and their work. Except in special cases it bears more 
on the daily affairs of life than any other subject.” 
Bits of history are introduced to show the close re- 
lation between the science of physics and human life. 
“The student should constantly keep in mind that the data of 
physics are much easier to remember if they are interpreted in 
terms of past experiences, everyday events, and that such in- 
terpretations are far more valuable than the mere acquisition of 
data.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  96 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Mann and Twiss, 1905: 
“The aim has been to show the student that knowledge of 
physics enables him to answer many of the questions over which 
he has puzzled long in vain.” 
“Beginning arguments with inventions, or general observa- 
tions of phenomena, may not be the logical order, but it is more 
nearly the order in which Nature herself teaches, and the result 
of the argument does not lose in definiteness, clearness, or ac- 
curacy, provided the laboratory is continually held up as the 
final court of appeal where all doubtful questions are settled.” 
“Each chapter is a continuous argument toward some prin- 
ciple or principles, and the entire book is an argument toward 
the conclusions stated in the last chapter,” 
which are in part: 
“Tt must be clear to every one who has read this book carefully 
that nature is not a vast chaos of chance happenings, but a well 
ordered and governed whole. When we study thoughtfully the 
phenomena about us, we must realize that there are some simple 
and universal principles which are manifest in them all. The 
universe in which we live is a marvelously organized and gov- 
erned unit and we are compelled to recognize that it could not 
have organized itself solely by the interaction of blind matter and 
undirected motion.” 
“The attempt is made (1) to interest the student in observing 
carefully and accurately first the familiar things about him and 
then the things in the laboratory; (2) to interest him in detect- 
ing analogies and similarities among the things observed; (3) to 
train him in keeping his mind free from bias and in drawing 
conclusions tentatively; (4) to make him see the value of verify- 
ing the conclusions and accepting the result whether it confirms 
or denies his inference.” 
“We have tried deliberately to give the student the impression 
that science leads to no absolute results — that, at best, it is 
merely a question of close approximation; of doing the best we 
can, and accepting the result tentatively, until we can do better. 
This attitude places the teacher also in the position of a learner
-P-A-G-E-113
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 97 
and prohibits him from making use of didactic or dogmatic state- 
ments; for these are the bane of science as well as of other things. 
Science instruction that does not develop mental integrity, free- 
dom of the personal judgment, and tolerance, fails in a vital spot.” 
“References are given to books in which the biographies of the 
great men of science may be read, and the student is urged to 
read them and report. The arguments used by some of the great 
thinkers have been briefly sketched, and the methods devised by 
them for reaching conclusions have been given. The attempt has 
been made to present them as they live in the ideas which they 
have handed down to us; to picture their mental processes and 
attitudes, and to show how one thing leads to another as the sub- 
ject develops in the discoverer’s mind.” 
Coleman, 1906: 
“The subject matter has been selected with reference primarily 
to its value as a part of a general education, and includes an un- 
usual amount of information based upon the facts of our daily 
experience, introduced as illustrations and applications of physi- 
cal principles.” 
“Physics deals largely with familiar natural phenomena and 
is therefore of special interest and profit as a part of a general 
education.” ‘‘A very important part of the material is acquired 
through the experiences of our daily life.” 
Milliken and Gale, 1906: 
“The book attempts to give a simple and immediate presenta- 
tion, in language which the student already understands, of the 
hows and whys of the physical world in which he lives.” 
“Tn the description and illustration of physical appliances the 
course has been made unusually complete because that is what 
the student is most eager to learn but cannot obtain from books 
because their language is too technical for him.” 
The portraits of sixteen of the great makers of 
physics have been inserted “‘for the sake of adding 
human and historic interest.”

  98 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
William Allanach, Elementary Lessons in Mag- 
netism and Electricity, London, 1906: 
“The author believes that the tendency in some recent books 
of striving for apparently accurate results so as to appeal to the 
student, is much to be deprecated, resulting as it frequently does 
in ‘fancy’ experiments which give a spurious semblance of ac- 
curacy. A little careful and honest thinking is worth much of it.” 
Hoadley, 1908 : 
“Especial effort has been made to lay proper emphasis upon 
the application of physics in everyday life.” 
“Simple apparatus. Most of the experiments are for demon- 
stration to the class, performed by teacher or chosen pupils.” 
“With a superabundance of excellent material within the 
scope of elementary physics, there would seem to be no valid 
reason for spending the first days in the laboratory on manipu- 
lation and measurement with vernier and micrometer calipers, 
the diagonal scale, the spherometer, etc., as is sometimes done 
with no physics in sight.” 
“The more simply and directly a physical problem is pre- 
sented to the pupil the better, that his thoughts and attention 
may not be diverted from the real point at issue. This principle 
is especially applicable in the early part of the laboratory course, 
where it is most frequently and more seriously violated by the use 
of micrometric instruments, the Jolly balance, etc., in the work on 
density and specific gravity, even before the pupil has had practice 
in the simpler methods of measuring and weighing. It would 
seem as if the express purpose of such work were at the outset 
to throw as many obstacles in the way of progress in physics as 
the ingenuity of teachers and instrument makers could devise.” 
“Perhaps the most striking illustration of what should not be 
done in this respect is afforded by the familiar quantitative ex- 
periments on the breaking strength of wires and on elasticity of 
stretching, bending, and twisting. These experiments lead abso- 
lutely to nothing in most high-school courses. The laws with 
which they deal are, for the most part, not considered in ele- 
mentary text-books.”
-P-A-G-E-115
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 99 
“The qualitative experimental study of phenomena rightly de- 
serves a large place in an elementary physics course. Economy 
of time and equipment, convenience, and the advantage of the 
superior skill of the teacher, are considerations in favor of pre- 
senting much of this material in the form of class-room experi- 
ments; but in a great many instances the laboratory experiment, 
affording, as it does, immediate sense perception of the phenom- 
ena in their simplest aspects and at close range, is greatly su- 
perior to any experiment viewed at a distance, and a laboratory 
course which fails to take this into account is necessarily one- 
sided and incomplete.” 
“Experiments should be regarded as a limited inquiry into the 
facts at first hand, not as sources of adequate data for generali- 
zation by the pupil, nor as ‘verifications’ of the laws and prin- 
ciples stated in the text. The pupil’s experiment is not a proof of 
the law, but an aid to the right understanding of it.” 
“What the pupil really does is to perform an experiment which 
within a fair degree of accuracy, illustrates or exemplifies the 
law; and he does this in order that he may the better understand 
it, not because the law is in need of ‘verification.’” 
“To encourage the pupil to draw hasty and unwarranted con- 
clusions from insufficient data is a vicious practice.” 
Adams, 1908: 
“Physics deals with phenomena in which every child is in- 
terested; it treats of subjects with which all men and women 
have more or less to do in practical life.” 
Crew and Jones, 1909: 
“Appeal to the everyday experience not only of boys but also 
of girls — show them physics as a science of daily life — assist 
the pupil in explaining the material phenomena of the world 
about him.” 
It is interesting to turn back and see what views 
were expressed on the teaching of physics nearly a 
century ago.
-P-A-G-E-116
100 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Elements of Physics by Dr. Neil Arnott, London, 
was written the same year that Faraday inaugurated 
his celebrated lectures to children at the Royal In- 
stitution (1826-27). The introduction contains the 
following : 
““Mathematies are at present generally made the beginning of 
the study, and the reason assigned is that scarcely any object in 
physics can be described without referring to quantity or pro- 
portion, and therefore, without using mathematical terms. Now 
this is true; but it is equally true that the mathematical knowl- 
edge, acquired by every individual in the common experience of 
childhood and early youth, is sufficient to enable students to 
understand all the great laws of nature.” 
“‘Most persons find attention to pure or abstract mathematics 
as irksome as the study of mere vocabulary of a language. This 
explains why so small a proportion of students, if taught in the 
common way, become good mathematicians, and why, where pure 
mathematics are made the avenue to Natural Philosophy, this 
also is so much neglected. It is remarkable how much the really 
simple and attractive science of comparing quantities has been 
rendered terrible to the great mass of mankind.” 
“The mode of proceeding is just as if a man, to whom per- 
mission were given to enter and possess a magnificent garden, on 
condition of his procuring a key to open the gate and measures 
of all kinds to estimate the riches contained within, should waste 
his whole life on the road in polishing one key, or in procuring 
several of different materials and workmanship, and in preparing 
a multiplicity of unnecessary measures.” 
“That the importance of physics has not been marked by the 
place which it has held in common systems of education, is owing 
chiefly (1) to the misconception that a knowledge of technical 
mathematics was a necessary preliminary, and (2) to an opinion 
that the degree of acquaintance with physics which all per- 
sons acquire by common experience, is sufficient for common 
purposes.” 
To a man who understands the simple truths of physics very  
-P-A-G-E-117
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 101 
many phenomena, which to the uninformed appear prodigies, 
are only beautiful illustrations of his fundamental knowledge — 
and this he carries about with him, not as an oppressive weight, 
but as a charm supporting the weight of other knowledge, and 
enabling him to add to his valuable store every new fact of con- 
sequence which may offer itself.” 
“Tt has been a common prejudice that persons thus instructed 
in general laws had their attention too much divided, and could 
know nothing perfectly. The very reverse, however, is true; for 
general knowledge renders all particular knowledge more clear 
and precise.”” 
“No treatise on Natural Philosophy can save, to a person de- 
siring full information on the subject, the necessity of attendance 
on experimental lectures or demonstrations. Things that are 
seen, and felt, and heard, that is, which operate on the external 
senses, leave on the memory much stronger, and more correct 
impressions, than where the conceptions are produced merely by 
verbal description, however vivid. And no man has ever been 
remarkable for his knowledge of physics who has not had prac- 
tical familiarity with the objects.” 
Among the typical lessons to be found on page 134, 
I have reproduced, as worthy of imitation to-day, 
Arnott’s method of presenting Newton’s third law. 
Of the numerous books on Natural Philosophy, 
intended for school use, written before Arnott’s, 
several are of great interest, but the only one to be 
mentioned here is that by Ferguson written about 
seventy-five years before Arnott’s book — about 
1750. This book passed through many editions. 
In 1805, it was revised by David Brewster of Edin- 
burgh, who will be recalled as the biographer of 
Sir Isaac Newton. The next year it was revised 
and brought out in America by Robert Patterson, 
Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University 
of Pennsylvania. 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  102 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Brewster says: 
“The chief object of Mr. Ferguson’s labors was to give a 
familiar view of physical science and to render it accessible to 
those who are not accustomed to mathematical investigation.” 
“Mr. Ferguson may be regarded as the first elementary writer 
on natural philosophy, and to his labors we must attribute that 
general diffusion of scientific knowledge among the practical 
mechanics of this country, which has, in a great measure, 
banished those antiquated prejudices and erroneous maxims 
of construction that perpetually mislead the unlettered artist.” 
“No book upon the same subject has been so generally read, 
and so widely circulated, among all ranks of the community. 
We perceive it in the workshop of every mechanic. We find it 
transferred into the different encyclopedias which this country 
has produced, and we may easily trace it in those popular systems 
of philosophy (natural philosophy, 7.e., physics) which have 
lately appeared.” 
Mr. Ferguson, although wholly a self-educated 
man (having had only about three months of school- 
ing), was elected a member of the Royal Society 
of London. His lectures were frequently attended 
by the King, who pensioned him in his later years. 
“He possessed a clear judgment and was capable of thinking 
and writing on philosophical subjects with great accuracy and 
precision. He had a peculiar talent for simplifying what was 
complex, for rendering intelligible, what was abstract, and for 
bringing down to the lowest capacities what was naturally above 
them.” 
It is interesting to note that Ferguson devotes 
sixty-two pages to machines in those days when 
there were exceedingly few machines, and his treat- 
ment of the principles of machines is surpassingly 
clear; whereas in our age of machinery when every
-P-A-G-E-119
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 103 
boy and girl needs to know much about the prin- 
ciples of machines and their practical applications 
in daily life, this subject is certainly most meagerly 
treated in text-books and altogether the most poorly 
taught portion of the whole subject of physics. 
Ferguson devotes forty pages to pumps, and 
although he was writing before oxygen was dis- 
covered and before the steam engine was invented, 
he gives a most fascinating account of a “‘fire-engine,”’ 
as he calls it, which, however, we should call a steam 
pump, or more specifically the atmospheric steam 
engine. 
Among the typical lessons to be found on pages 
128-131 I have thought it would be not only in- 
teresting, but even suggestive of a good method of 
teaching a subject to-day, to reproduce Ferguson’s 
treatment of The Spring of the Air. 
Pestalozzi died in the year that Arnott wrote 
his Natural Philosophy, and about that same time 
the Lessons on Objects written by Elizabeth Mayo 
was beginning to attract the attention of educators 
in London. 
These Object Lessons ran through fourteen edi- 
tions in London during the next thirty years, and 
finally the book was revised and brought out in 
this country by Dr. Sheldon of Oswego, who had as 
his collaborator Professor Hermann Krusi, also 
teaching at Oswego, but who was born in the school 
of Pestalozzi, where his father taught for twenty 
years. 
Physics teaching in the high schools, before the 
colleges took a hand in the matter in 1886, was 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
    104 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
powerfully influenced by this movement to teach 
from the object rather than from the book and to 
take into consideration the nature and requirements 
of the pupil when making a choice of matter and 
method of instruction. 
“In 1837 the School Committee of Boston ordered a few 
articles of philosophical apparatus to be furnished for each of the 
grammar schools of that city.” 
The above appears in the preface of A School 
Compendium of Natural and Experimental Philos- 
ophy, written by Richard Green Parker, Principal of 
Johnson Grammar School. The book was written 
to go with the Boston set of apparatus. It contains 
engravings of the apparatus and a description of 
experiments to be performed with it. This Boston 
set consisted of nearly one hundred pieces and cost 
$275. The book went through twenty-two editions 
in the first twelve years and was still being revised 
as late as 1854 at least. 
Very respectable equipment for the teaching of 
physics was to be found in academies and high 
schools all over the country soon after this and there 
were numerous firms (even more numerous than 
now) in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, whose 
business it was to manufacture and sell apparatus 
for the schools. 
This apparatus was used for demonstration pur- 
poses by the teachers who were usually the prin- 
cipals of the schools, and for the most part good 
teachers. They applied a large amount of common 
sense to the teaching of physics and with a large
-P-A-G-E-121
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 105 
personal influence’ they impressed the pupils with 
the dignity and importance of the subject. There 
are many now living who are in position to speak 
of the effect of this instruction and compare it with 
that which now obtains. I am gathering such testi- 
mony and shall be glad to hear from any who may 
read this. : 
That the subject was very widely taught might 
be inferred from the great demand for text-books, 
which appeared almost as frequently fifty years ago 
as now and passed through in some cases an aston- 
ishing number of editions. The aim of the instruc- 
tion in physics fifty years ago was generally stated 
to be the interpretation of the natural phenomena 
of life. It must be confessed that the writers of 
text-books in those days about as often as in these 
days failed to carry out this idea in the body of 
their texts. But I am of the opinion that the teach- 
ers of those days, more often than the teachers of 
to-day, carried that purpose into effect, the chief 
reasons being (1) a large proportion of them had 
received training directly from nature’s school. 
A goodly number of them had college training, to 
be sure, but so far as it had touched them on the 
side of science it had led them to nature rather than 
away from it. (2) They were unhampered in 
their teaching by any prescription from a higher 
institution made in the supposed interests of some- 
thing or somebody else than the pupils themselves. 
In 1838, Olmsted’s Natural Philosophy for Schools 
and Academies stated the purpose to give an “‘ex- 
hibition of the principles of Natural Philosophy 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  106 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
with very copious applications of them to the arts 
and to the phenomena of nature.” 
In 1847, Dr. John W. Draper, Professor at New 
York University, wrote his Natural Philosophy for 
Schools. He preferred to begin with air and water 
rather than mechanics because the latter “is a more 
difficult and more forbidding subject.” He says: 
“The main object of a teacher should be to communicate a 
clear and general view of the great features of his science, and 
to do this in an agreeable and short manner. It is too often 
forgotten that the beginner knows nothing; and the first thing 
to be done is to awaken in him an interest in the study, and to 
present to him a view of the scientific relations of those natural 
objects with which he is most familiar. When his curiosity is 
aroused, he will readily go through things that are abstract and 
forbidding, which, had they been presented at first, would have 
discouraged or perhaps disgusted him.” 
“There are two different methods in which Natural Philosophy 
is now taught: (1) as an experimental science; (2) as a branch 
of mathematics. I believe that the proper course is to teach 
physical science experimentally first.” 
“Why is it that the most acute mathematicians and meta- 
physicians the world has ever produced for two thousand years 
made so little advance in knowledge, and why have the last two 
centuries produced such a wonderful revolution in human 
affairs? It is from the lesson first taught by Bacon, that so 
liable to fallacy are the operations of the intellect, experiment 
must always be the great engine of human discovery, and, there- 
fore, of human advancement.” 
Hooker, Natural Philosophy for Schools, 1863: 
“Daniel Webster, in his autobiography, speaks thus of his 
entering upon the study of law: 
«*T was put to study in the old way — that is, the hardest 
book first — and lost much time. I read Coke on Littleton 
through without understanding a quarter of it. Happening to
-P-A-G-E-123
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 107 
take up Espinasse’s “Law of Nisi Prius,” I found I could under- 
stand it; and arguing that the object of reading was to under- 
stand what was written, I laid down the venerable Coke et alios 
similes reverendos, and kept company for a time with Mr. 
Espinasse and others, the most plain, easy, and intelligible 
writers. Why disgust and discourage a boy by telling him that 
he must break into his profession through such a wall as this?’” 
“Here is most graphically depicted a defect which is now, as 
it was then, very prominent in all departments of education.” 
“In the books which are used in teaching natural science, it 
is especially prominent. Even in the elementary books, formal 
propositions and technical terms render the study uninviting, and 
to a great extent unintelligible.” 
“Tn the whole course of education, the natural sciences should 
be made prominent from the beginning to the end, not only be- 
cause they are of practical value, but also because they are as 
useful in their way for mental discipline as the study of mathe- 
matics and of language.” 
“They can be taught to some extent to the youngest pupils, if 
they be presented in the right manner. And the busy inquiries 
which they make after the reasons of the facts, and their appre- 
ciation of them if stated simply and without technical terms, show 
the appropriateness of such teaching. Children are really very 
good philosophers in their way. They have great activity not only 
of their perception but of their reasoning faculties also, to which 
due range should be given in education. Not a year should pass 
during the whole course when the pupil shall not be engaged 
in studying some one of the physical sciences to some extent.” 
“The teaching of the natural sciences in our colleges is gener- 
ally a failure, and it always will be so as long as the present plan 
is continued. In order to have it successful there must be the 
same gradation in teaching them that we have in teaching language 
and the mathematics.” 
Rolfe and Gillet, 1868 : 
“There is, as there ought to be, a rapidly increasing demand 
on the part of the public that the study of natural philosophy 
shall be introduced into our Grammar and District Schools.”
-P-A-G-E-124
108 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
“The authors believe that the subject is both such as every 
one ought to know about, and such as can be profitably treated 
in a sufficiently elementary form for the use of these schools.” 
“The authors believe that in teaching the sciences the aim 
should be, not so much to present facts and the bare statement 
of principles, as to train the mind to see how from the simple facts 
of observation we arrive at the principles of science.” 
“First establish the facts by experiment and then draw out 
the principle.” 
“Use simplest experiments and simplest apparatus.” 
“ach lesson is to be explained and illustrated with the class 
before being given out to be studied.” 
There were many other writers of books of Natural 
Philosophy for the schools, but enough has been 
quoted to show the trend. In this connection it 
will be to the point to quote something from John 
Tyndall’s lecture delivered in 1854 at the Royal 
Institution of Great Britain on “Physics as a Branch 
of Education for All.” 
“The needs and tendencies of human nature express them- 
selves through the early yearnings of the child. He desires to 
know the character and the causes of the phenomena presented 
to him; and I claim for the study of Physics the recognition 
that it answers to an impulse implanted by nature in the human 
constitution, and he who would oppose such study must be 
prepared to exhibit the credentials which authorize him to con- 
travene Nature’s manifest design.” 
“Most of the questions asked by children concern natural 
phenomena, facts of everyday life. Now the fact is beyond the 
boy’s control, and so certainly is the desire to know its cause. 
The sole question then is, Is this desire to be gratified or not? 
Who created the fact? Who implanted the desire? Certainly 
not man — and will any man undertake to place himself be- 
tween the mind and the fact, and proclaim a divorce between 
them?”  
-P-A-G-E-125
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 109 
“Every physician knows that something more than mere me- 
chanical motion is comprehended under the idea of healthful ex- 
ercise. What, for example, could be substituted for the jubilant 
shout of the playground? You may have more systematic 
motions. You may devise means for the more perfect traction 
of each particular muscle, but you cannot create the joy and 
gladness of the game, and where these are absent, the charm and 
the health of the exercise are gone. The case is similar with 
mental education.” 
“In the study of Physics, induction and deduction are per- 
petually married to each other.” 
The following is from Thorndike’s Principles of 
Teaching (page 157) : 
“The verification of conclusions is the keynote of correct in- 
ductive thinking in the world at large, and should be more prom- 
inent in the school. The common practice of children is to accept 
as true whatever the teacher does not oppose. This is not so- 
bad as it may seem, for ‘to be accepted by the expert’ is a sort 
of verification well known and not despised by science, and to 
the scholar the teacher stands ‘in loco experti’ . . . and recourse 
to other authorities than the teacher provides useful experience 
of the bulk of expert knowledge which is stored up in diction- 
aries, encyclopedias, maps, books, and the like.” 
MeMurry in his Special Methods in Science, after 
stating what have been the various aims in science 
teaching (such as: teaching observation; under- 
standing and mastering the physical conditions 
of life-utility; mental discipline; classification — 
system and law), proposes as a suitable aim, in- 
sight into nature, a sympathetic appreciation with a 
view to a growing adjustment to the physical and 
social environment. He adds: 
“The intrusive and masterful way in which natural science 
has been coming into our houses, factories, and industries of all 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  110 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
sorts, compels us to pay considerable attention to the applica- 
tions of science to life.” | 
The idea which has been most consistently and 
uniformly expressed in all the prefaces of text-books 
already quoted is vitalize the teaching of physics, 
teach its applications to life. From examination 
of the texts themselves it appears to be in the minds 
of all of the authors that the method should be, first, 
teach the principles, and second, mention appli- 
cations, as we teach rules of grammar and illustrate 
by giving sentences from literature. At any rate, 
so far as any attempt to actually teach the applica- 
tions of physical principles to life is made, this is 
the method used and this is precisely why the teach- 
ing of physics is languishing. The number of so- 
called principles has been doubled and even quad- 
rupled since the days of Ferguson and Arnott, and 
the colleges at present specify by syllabus a Jong 
list of those which the candidate must be able to 
demonstrate like propositions in geometry. The 
method of teaching physics — no matter how much 
laboratory work it may include — does not differ 
essentially from the method of teaching geometry. 
Only the case is worse for physics than for geometry. 
For in geometry, there is a mutual dependence of 
one proposition upon another, but in physics, in 
spite of the efforts of one or two authors to the con- 
trary, there never has been, and I presume there 
never can be, an organized whole to physics which 
will appeal to the mind of a high-school pupil. The 
fundamental idea which may be assumed to run 
through it all will always be found too subtle and
-P-A-G-E-127
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 111 
too profound for his comprehension. To him Boyle’s 
law is never related to anything else in physics; 
and if on college entrance examination he does not 
state the law of Charles for that of Boyle, it is a 
sheer piece of good luck; for that matter, if he 
does not make up an entirely new law by stating 
parts of each, it is only his good fortune. And why 
should he remember the vast number of strange 
and unrelated facts or principles — unrelated to 
each other and unrelated to any experience in his 
life? Even the laboratory illustrations given him, 
ostensibly for the purpose of throwing light on the 
principles, are like an attempt to define one unknown 
word by another equally unfamiliar. 
Black and Davis hold that one has always to keep 
in mind the capacities and limitations, the interests 
and inclinations, of young people. They say that 
in preparing their book they tried to select only 
those topics which are of vital interest to the young. 
Everybody, they assert, needs to know something 
about the working of the machinery which is found 
in modern homes. 
Their plan is to begin each topic with some con- 
crete illustration, familiar to young people, proceed 
to a deduction of the general principle, and then 
show how to make use of this principle by discussing 
other practical applications of it. 
The study of physics, they believe, does not begin 
and end in the classroom, but is intimately con- 
nected with industrial and domestic life. 
In order to stimulate in students thought and 
imagination about what they see, and to get them 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  112 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
into the habit of asking intelligent questions of 
mechanics, artisans, and engineers whom they meet, 
the authors have added at the end of the chapters 
questions which require some knowledge gained in 
this way from outside life. 
Now to illustrate each principle by referring it 
to some one of life’s experiences would be a great 
step in advance, but to turn the method of procedure 
around and develop only such principles as grow 
out of and interpret life’s experiences would be not 
only ideal but, in the nature of the case, the only 
method which can be successful. 
One cannot help thinking that if the high-school 
teachers of the country had been as free to work out 
their method of instruction as the elementary-school 
teachers have been during the last twenty years, 
they would have learned to apply to physics the 
modern, yet abundantly tried and eminently success- 
ful, method of teaching language to small children. 
This matter is so well stated by McMurry in his 
Special Methods in Science that I cannot do better 
than to quote him. It will be noticed that McMurry 
is here speaking of the teaching of science in the ele- 
mentary school — what some call nature-study ; but 
I am wholly in agreement with Professor Bailey 
that nature-study is not a new subject but a new 
mode of teaching, which is just as applicable to the 
high school and the college as to elementary 
schools. 
“A child does not want the alphabet (that is, the simple prin- 
ciples) of science any more than he wants the names of the letters 
of the alphabet when learning to read.”
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 113 
“What he needs is to observe more closely and to put things 
together for better interpretation.” 
“There is another great advantage in teaching science where 
we find it in these centers of life’s activity, and not in some 
isolated scientific form in laboratories or text-books.” 
“The child who draws his knowledge of science directly from 
life, under normal conditions, will not have much difficulty in 
finding it again in life and applying it to life. It is not difficult 
to so isolate the study of physics and chemistry from the usual 
conditions of life that the student in after years will have more 
difficulty in rediscovering his knowledge than he had in first ac- 
quiring it. But the child who learns from the start to trace facts 
to their native lair will recognize them again under similar sur- 
roundings. In the usual study of the natural sciences, each 
science centers its materials around its leading principle, but 
from the home as a center radiate problems into all the sciences. 
Ventilation is based on physics and physiology; cooking on 
chemistry and several other sciences. House sanitation draws 
from most of the sciences. Heating and lighting carry us into 
several fields of applied science. In later years he may devote 
himself to a study and ordering of one or more of the separate 
sciences, but their chief merit after all will be the service they 
are able to render to these original centers of human interest. 
If we should take each of the natural sciences as a controlling 
center of study, we should have a complicated and difficult, if 
not impossible, course of study. Elementary science more 
perhaps than any other study is home-abiding and begets 
respect and admiration for common things.” 
“As a rule teachers are over-hasty in urging children toward 
generalizations. They wish them to leap from one or two facts 
or examples to important conclusions of classifications.” 
“Teachers and adults are prone to give emphasis to general 
laws far beyond what children need.” 
“The applications of science to life have so transformed our 
surroundings that we live in a very different world from that of 
fifty years ago. To live properly in this new world is to under- 
stand it, to fit into it and to make the best use of it. Since the 
changes are due chiefly to scientific inventions and improvements, 
I
-P-A-G-E-130
114 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
progress in education calls for a direct and more partial acquaint- 
ance with sciences by common people.” 
“The problem of object and experiment teaching is the most 
highly recommended and the least successfully practiced phase 
of instruction. The freedom and confidence with which teachers, 
high and low, recommend observational and experimental science, 
and the modesty and scarcity of those who succeed in such teach- 
ing is an illustration of the wide breach between enthusiastic 
theory and successful practice.” 
Dr. James E. Russell in the December, 1909, issue 
of the Educational Review says: 
“Bookish work when properly understood is above criticism. 
In so far as the aim of learning is to acquire knowledge there is 
no good reason for spending an hour in manipulation when the 
fact may be as well taught without it in a minute.” 
I am very sure that a large portion of the hours 
now spent in the laboratory might with profit all 
around be contracted to an equal number of minutes 
spent with books, but better than that they might 
be much expanded and profitably expended in get- 
ting together, comparing, and explaining the experi- 
ences which pupils have or may have under proper 
guidance. 
Let there be, however, vastly more — ten times 
as much —reading on the subject as now. Let 
there still be a laboratory for personal contact with 
things and for large measurements — pounds and 
feet — such as ordinary people use. 
The quantitative treatment of the subject belongs 
quite as much to the lecture as to the laboratory. 
The process of vitalizing physics gets small assistance 
from the conventional laboratory work — indeed, 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 115 
the demonstration of physical principles is not much 
forwarded by the laboratory measurements. It is 
not only possible, but usual, that students lose the 
rationale of the whole subject under consideration 
by laboratory work which has lost none of its dis- 
tractions in the recent attempts to make it rigorous. 
I am sure that Draper was right when he said 
that the subjects with which to begin the teaching of 
physics are water and air. A considerable portion 
of that which usually precedes this subject should 
be omitted from a high-school course and much of 
the rest should be brought in incidentally and 
scattered among the other subjects. What remains 
might form a later chapter. 
Suppose with a class in a city school we begin the 
work by taking up the problem — the very large 
problem — of supplying suitable water to people 
who dwell in a crowded community. New York, 
for example, needs more water than falls in the 
whole Croton watershed of 300 square miles. 
We must go as far as the Catskills to get a supply 
that is sufficiently abundant and sufficiently pure. 
The newspapers have set forth the facts and have 
said much about the engineering feats of this under- 
taking. The physics teacher must enable the future 
citizens to gain some idea of them. For example, 
the aqueduct must be carried under the Hudson, 
and in order to find a firm bottom it must go down 
1100 feet below the water level of the river. Now 
the weight of that water is about 15 pounds per 
square inch for each 34 feet of depth, or about 45 
pounds per square inch for each 100 feet of depth 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  116 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
and therefore about 500 pounds per square inch at a 
depth of 1100 feet. The method of determining the 
ratio of pressure to depth should be quickly shown 
by a lecture experiment and it will naturally be often 
_ referred to afterward so as to be well understood and 
not easily forgotten. 
I once lived in a house where although the water 
pressure was great the pipes were so small that not 
more than one faucet could be used successfully at 
one time. If some one was drawing water in the 
laundry-tubs, it was useless to try to get water to 
flow from the faucet at the bath-tub. Show this 
fall in pressure along a water pipe as an increasing 
number of faucets are opened, by putting a pressure 
gauge on one of the faucets and noting its behavior 
as each succeeding faucet is opened. Quite inci- 
dentally, compare this with the fall in potential 
along an electric circuit as additional lamps are 
turned on, and later refer to this again when teach- 
ing electricity. This continual cross reference and 
r¢petition is of the utmost importance. We do not 
earn things once for all. 
Now this fall in pressure introduces our most 
difficult problem in the distribution of city water. 
Although our aqueduct will be a larger tube than the 
subway tunnel, and our city water mains are four or 
five feet in diameter, it will be very difficult to get 
the water to flow through them fast enough to meet 
the demand, and so pumps must be used to assist 
the flow. Our reservoir at High Bridge is about 
150 feet above our basement at Teachers College. We 
go down into the basement and read the pressure 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 117 
gauge and find it only 30 pounds per square inch 
when it would be 67 pounds if we were the only 
persons to draw water from the mains. So great is 
the draught of water from the mains that the fall of 
pressure (fall of potential) is 37 (67-30) pounds per 
square inch in coming a little more than two miles. 
This fall in pressure has greatly increased as the 
city has grown up around us. 
Within the building also the pressure on certain 
faucets has fallen from 8 pounds to 2 pounds per 
square inch because of the increase in the number 
of students and the consequent increase in the use 
of water. 
It is.quite similar with the electric conductors. 
The lamps of a certain lecture room once had 110 
volts of electric pressure, whereas now they fre- 
quently have not more than 105 volts. 
The time was when water would flow of its own 
accord at my lecture table on the fourth floor, but 
now it would seldom reach the second floor if it was 
not helped by a pump. The question of whether 
water presses equally in all directions will not be 
raised by the pupils at this point and had better 
not be injected too soon, but let attention be called 
to it incidentally a little later, not by the usual 
formal demonstration, but as a fact which has been 
demonstrated every time we have read the pressure 
gauge. 
The physics teacher should teach hygiene quite 
as much as the biology teacher does, and he should 
teach chemistry whenever he gets a chance, whether 
he is nominally the chemistry teacher or not. The
-P-A-G-E-134
  118 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
water filters demand his attention on all of these 
counts: What they mean to health; How they save 
the steam boilers; How they obviate plumbing 
difficulties; What alum is needed for; etc. 
The physics teacher should teach about all sorts 
of mechanisms; as, for example, water meters, 
pressure gauges, etc. Buoyancy and Archimedes’ 
principle will be suggested somewhere about this 
time, and should have many lecture-room demon- 
strations and many individual laboratory experi- 
ments to make the matter a real experience. Specific 
gravity is not worthy of all the attention that is now 
given to it. It had better not be brought into this 
chapter at all, and in any case it should not be 
treated in the minute way which is usual. This 
exceedingly simple matter is generally obscured 
by being mixed up with buoyancy and paraffined 
blocks and lead sinkers and whatnot, which have no 
natural connection with it. Many days are spent 
in working on experiments and on arithmetical prob- 
lems apparently devised as “busy work” to “hold 
down”? the students lest they play. 
I was conversing recently with an intelligent 
builder about how much a certain wagonload of 
Georgia pine weighed, and he settled the matter 
by sawing off a block one foot long from a timber 
which was four inches square at the end, and weigh- 
ing it. He found that the block weighed five pounds, 
and from this he quickly calculated the weight of 
his load. I remarked that he had _ incidentally 
found the specific gravity of the wood to be about 
three-quarters, and he said, “ Well I should never 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 119 
have suspected that. When I studied physics we 
made that a very complex matter which I never 
understood.” 
I suggested to him that the fact that a cubic foot 
of water weighs 62.5 pounds and that spruce timber 
is usually about half as heavy, while granite and 
most other kinds of rock are about 2.5 as heavy as 
water, would be very useful to remember. For 
instance, this enables. us to quickly calculate that a 
granite paving block 12 X 6 X 4 inches must weigh 
about 26 pounds, and that 200 of them would make 
a heavy load for a team of horses on a good road. 
Some reader has by this time queried whether 
our intention is to amuse and entertain the pupils 
and to relax their work. My purpose is to get 
more work and more intelligent work than we find 
now in our school laboratories. If the work is of 
absorbing and compelling interest, so much the 
better. I like to see high-school pupils work. They 
like to work. Three-quarters of all the pupils who 
enter the high schools of this country drop out dur- 
ing the course because they are tired of loafing and 
want to go to work. Give them something worth 
while to do and they will remain in school to work. 
In order that we may examine the action of pumps, 
traps, “‘back-air” pipes, pressure tanks, hydraulic 
elevators, injectors, gas meters, etc., etc., we need 
to get an appreciation that air has weight and 
exerts pressure much as water does, also that it 
expands indefinitely if pressure is removed from 
it. One hundred and fifty years ago people were 
just as curious about the atmosphere and its prop-  
-P-A-G-E-136
  120 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
erties as we are now about radio-activity. Public 
lectures upon the subject were crowded. It took a 
long time for people to appreciate the fact that they 
were living in the midst of an atmosphere which had 
weight, occupied space to the exclusion of other 
matter, and in general behaved very much like 
water. Teachers to-day forget that their pupils 
require a long time to arrive at a working knowledge 
of these facts. They need many closely related 
experiences to render the knowledge real. A single 
experiment, a brief statement, is not enough. To 
show by a lecture experiment that air has weight 
and to tell the pupils that a cubic foot of the air 
that surrounds them weighs about an ounce and a 
quarter is well worth while, but the real truth of 
the matter will not be appreciated until the subject 
has been attacked many times and on many sides. 
The pupils need some physics readers or perhaps 
leaflets. Let me attempt to write here a sample 
chapter in the hope that many others will be per- 
suaded to take up this sort of authorship until the 
material for teaching physics becomes as rich as 
that for teaching history and English now is. 
The Air 
Looking from the window of my lecture room I 
see powerful elm trees rocking in the wind. Cer- 
tainly to bend them so far would require the power 
of many horses. How could anything by pushing 
against them move them so greatly unless it had a 
considerable weight? By roughly estimating the 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 121 
number of cubic feet I calculate that the air in this 
lecture room weighs two tons; and with my anemom- 
eter I find that the wind is blowing forty miles 
an hour at present, and even while I am saying this 
a large limb has just been torn from the trunk of 
one of the trees. What might one expect if, say, the 
two tons of air which is in this lecture room should 
move at the rate of forty miles an hour and strike 
against anything? If I roll these two rubber balls, 
which look alike to you, upon the floor and each 
comes in contact with the leg of a chair, you will 
readily infer from what you see that one is a hollow 
ball while the other is solid, for one is deflected from 
its course without moving the chair while the other 
carries the chair with it some distance. So when 
you see a freight car moving down the track to 
couple with another, you infer whether it is loaded 
or empty by the way it moves and by the power of 
its blow when it comes in contact with the other 
ear. That is, our experience has taught us to feel 
that the damage which a moving body can do by 
collision depends very much upon its weight. This 
is why one might be willing to catch a light ball 
thrown at him when he would avoid a heavy one. 
But catching a ball suggests another consideration. 
One is willing to catch a ball thrown slowly when 
he would avoid one thrown swiftly, and we in- 
stinctively conclude something about the velocity 
of the wind by the work it will do. Hence I found 
its velocity by means of this little windmill with a 
cyclometer attached, called an anemometer. When 
we speak of the wind’s blowing hard we are apt to 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  122 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
think only of its velocity, and I suppose it would 
be natural to say that a forty-mile wind was blowing 
twice as hard as a twenty-mile wind. The fact is, 
however, that a forty-mile wind will push four 
times as hard against things as a twenty-mile wind 
does. Some definite figures will add to the interest 
of this study. When smoke ascends straight we 
say there is no wind. When the fdgs are just 
stretched out the wind is blowing ten or twelve 
miles an hour. It is not difficult " estimate a 
twenty-mile breeze by noting the movement of the 
smaller branches of trees, and a thirty-mile wind by 
noting the movement of the larger branches of the 
trees, and a forty-mile storm wind by the swaying 
of the whole trunks of trees. If one compares his 
estimates with the testimony of the anemometer for 
a time he will soon become quite adept. A ten- 
mile breeze will give half a pound per square foot 
of wind pressure for sailing. A twenty-mile breeze 
will furnish 2 pounds per square foot. A thirty- 
mile wind will give 4.5 pounds and a forty-mile gale 
will furnish: 8 pounds. When you estimate the 
number of square feet in your sail and think of the 
number of pieces of lead ballast you are carrying it 
readily appears a dangerous wind for small boats. 
When the College was first built we had six window- 
panes which were too large for their thickness to 
withstand the wind pressure and one after another 
they smashed in until finally we saved the last of 
them by putting a sash across the middle. Our 
leaded glass windows are all of them more or less 
concaved by the wind pressure. The wind lifts
-P-A-G-E-139
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 123 
buildings from their foundations, uproots trees, 
piles up great snow banks and great sand dunes, 
raises mighty waves with their tons of water because 
air has weight. 
I should like to have you go with me and see a 
flywheel in our engineroom. The rim of this wheel 
is moving at the rate of sixty miles per hour. Its 
surface is so smooth that you can let it rub against 
your hand without injury, in spite of its high velocity. 
Standing near it, as you now are, you feel a wind 
that makes you hold on to your hat. The air is 
very still in all the rest of the engine room. Now 
stand one side while I pour some water upon this 
wheel, and you note that the wall of the room is 
now getting spattered with that water. One reason 
why the surface of that wheel keeps so bright and 
clean is that the wheel itself throws off from its sur- 
face every bit of dirt which might come in contact 
with it. It is in like manner throwing off the air in 
constant streams. Does not this make one realize 
that air is a fluid like water, having weight — al- 
though invisible? There must also be friction be- 
tween it and the wheel. Ill pour upon this wheel 
a steady stream of water and let you notice it leav- 
ing the wheel on the line of a tangent. The so- 
called ‘“‘centrifugal force” causes things to fly away 
on a tangent rather than on a line leading directly 
from the center. If you try to use a sling you will 
need to know this fact. Or to state it still more in 
accordance with our natural experience, when the 
water gets in motion it tends to move in a straight 
line rather than around a curve. This flywheel 
   
-P-A-G-E-140
       
  124 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
    suggests our ventilating fans, which | 
at while they are standing still. One of these wheels 
reminds one of a water wheel. One might imagine 
such a wheel well inclosed and revolving rapidly 
backward, throwing water from a lower reservoir 
up the “waterfall”? back into the Bt pond See 
Figure 1. If the wheel were perfectly smooth at its 
rim some considerable amount of water would be 
thrown up the flume by reason of the friction. But 
it must be perfectly evident that the flanges across 
the rim of the wheel serve still better to keep the 
stream of water from slipping backward. The 
result is that the stream of water tends to keep 
more nearly the velocity of the wheel — just as a 
chain belt working over a cog wheel does less slipping 
back than a leather belt. 
  the first one of our ventilating fans which we come 
to on our trip about the building. A represents the 
intake of outdoor air, and B the ducts which dis- 
tribute the air to the rooms of the ipa Of 
course we shall return to this often when studying Figure 1 represents fairly the ihr of
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 125 
the heating, the filtering, and the humidifying of 
this air. The other ventilating fans about the 
building differ from each other in minor points, but 
chiefly they differ from this in that they take in the 
air at C instead of at A. The inlet ducts bring the 
air to the center of the wheels along the line of their 
axles. The wheels are of skeleton construction 
and the air is thrown out at B as before, simply be- 
cause it has weight and tends to fly off on a tangent. 
It requires eighty horse-power to run the ventilating 
fans which push the air through the Horace Mann 
School building. This means that air has weight 
and offers resistance to motion. It costs about $50 
a day just to push the air along, which fact seems 
appalling when looked at in that way, but that is 
only five cents a day for each pupil; and when we 
consider that 14,406 persons in New York State died 
of consumption in the year 1907 — that is, they 
died for want of fresh air — we must be willing to 
spend five cents a day for fresh air for each pupil 
in school. 
Figure 1 also explains the construction of a “ro-. 
tary”? pump, a form of pump very much in use now 
not only for moving water but air, as particularly 
in the case of vacuum cleaners, one of which we will 
examine next. The hose is attached at A for “suc- 
tion” or at B for blowing. 
It must be evident that the stream of air is driven 
on by the weight of the air behind rather than by 
any such unthinkable thing as a pull or “suction.” 
What the wheel, or pump, does is to push the air 
from before it and the weight of the atmosphere
-P-A-G-E-142
  126 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
moves the air in from behind to keep the space full. 
We are at the bottom of an ocean of: air, and we 
may best appreciate this condition by imagining 
ourselves at the bottom of an ocean of water, be- 
cause it appeals to our senses more directly. If we 
did live at the bottom of an ocean of water 34 feet 
deep, the water would press upon us with the same 
weight that our atmosphere now presses. By means 
of this pressure gauge I will show you that the pres- 
sure of our atmosphere is 15 pounds per square 
inch. Of course the air is pressing upon all sides of 
the wheel of the vacuum cleaner and when the 
wheel moves it drives a stream of air exactly as it 
would water if submerged in that. We shall return 
to the vacuum cleaner again to study several fea- 
tures about it. But let us now recall an experience 
you may have had while riding in an automobile or 
an open trolley car. Let us suppose a quiet day, 
when the smoke rises straight upward (not, by the 
way, because it is without weight but because the 
air is heavier than it and pushes it up). Let us 
imagine, I say, a quiet day when there is no wind, 
and we will start our automobile at the rate of ten 
miles per hour. We are now pushing our way 
through this quiet air and we feel a resistance of 
half a pound per square foot. The effect is the same 
as it would be if we stood still in a ten-mile breeze. 
A small flag which we carry stands out in the same 
manner as it would in such a breeze. Now let us 
increase our speed to twenty miles per hour and 
hold our flag with two hands across our line of 
motion. We are now pushing against the air with
-P-A-G-E-143
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 127 
a force of two pounds per square foot. At forty 
miles an hour we push eight pounds per square foot 
and at sixty miles per hour we push eighteen pounds 
per square foot, which splits our flag. If we could 
make it one hundred miles per hour we should feel 
the pressure of fifty pounds per square foot exactly 
as many persons have experienced it in a hurricane. 
This experience, upon reflection, makes one feel that 
air has weight and occupies space which it does not 
yield to other bodies without resistance. 
A windmill operates because air has weight and 
pushes against it. If the windmill is 25 feet in di- 
ameter a fifteen-mile per hour breeze develops one 
horse-power. The propeller wheel of an aéroplane 
drives the plane forward because in its motion it 
pushes against the air, which offers the necessary 
resistance, even as water offers the necessary re- 
sistance to the propeller of a steamboat. The 
aéroplane lifts itself and its machinery and its pas- 
sengers because its planes meet with the necessary 
resistance from the air as they cut it at an angle. 
The rising of a balloon must be looked upon as 
direct evidence that air has weight. The dirigible 
balloons which went up near the College a few 
months ago each contained about 7500 cubic feet 
of hydrogen. This pushed 7500 cubic feet of air 
out of its place. A cubic foot of air weighs 1.28 
ounces, and it is about fourteen times as heavy as 
hydrogen. Hence the 7500 cubic feet of air dis- 
placed weighs about 544 pounds more than the 
hydrogen and therefore pushes the hydrogen up 
with that much force. Hence the bag of the balloon,
-P-A-G-E-144
eo een eT ee 
128 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
the car, the engine, the man, and his baggage, all 
together equaled in weight not far from 500 pounds. 
Think how the fact that air is matter is illustrated 
by the inflated football, the pneumatic tires of 
automobiles, air mattresses and cushions, air cushions 
in door checks, air brakes, air guns, caissons, diving 
bells, machinery of all sorts moved by compressed 
air acting like steam. But lastly think of liquid air, 
which is merely ordinary air reduced by cold and 
by pressure to about sts part of its normal volume 
and which weighs a little more than water. 
The following is a portion of a lecture by James 
Ferguson, F.R.S., on the “Spring of the Air” de- 
livered some one hundred pnd fifty years ago. It 
is presented here as a good example of how the 
subject should be taught nian — namely, by pre- 
senting the same phenomenon in many different 
ways. 
To Show the Elasticity or Spring of the Air 
14. Tie up a very small quantity of air in a bladder, and put 
it under a receiver ; then exhaust the air out of the receiver ; and 
the small quantity which is confined in the bladder (having noth- 
ing to act against it) will so expand itself by the force of its 
spring, as to fill the bladder as full as it could be blown of com- 
mon air. But upon letting the air into the receiver again, it will 
overpower the air in the bladder, and press its sides almost close 
together. 
15. If the bladder so tied up be put into a wooden box, and 
have 20 or 30 pound-weight of lead upon it in the box, and the 
box be covered with a close receiver ; upon exhausting the air out 
of the receiver, that air which is confined in the bladder will so 
expand itself as to raise up all the lead by the force of its spring. 
16. Take the glass ball mentioned in the fifth experiment,
-P-A-G-E-145
  
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 129 
which was left full of water, all but a small bubble of air at top, 
and having set it with its neck downward into the empty phial 
aa, and covered it with a close receiver, exhaust the air out of the 
receiver, and the small bubble of air in the top of the ball will 
expand itself, so as to force all the water out of the ball into the 
phial. 
17. Screw the pipe A B into the pump-plate, place the tall re- 
ceiver G H upon the plate ¢ d, as in the twelfth experiment, and 
exhaust the air out of the receiver; then turn the cock e to keep 
out the air, unscrew the pipe from the pump, and screw it into 
the mouth of the copper vessel C G (Fig. 15), the vessel having 
first been about half filled with water. Then open the cock e 
(Fig. 11), and the spring of the air which is confined in the 
copper vessel will force the water up through the pipe A B in a 
jet into the exhausted receiver, as strongly as it did by its pres- 
sure on the surface of the water in a bason, in the twelfth ex- 
periment. 
18. If a fowl, a cat, rat, mouse, or bird, be put under a re- 
ceiver, and the air be exhausted, the animal will be at first op- 
pressed as with a great weight, then grow convulsed, and at last 
expire in all the agonies of a most bitter and cruel death. But 
as this experiment is too shocking to every spectator who has the 
least degree of humanity, we substitute a machine called the 
lungs-glass in place of the animal. 
19. If a butterfly be suspended in a receiver, by a fine thread 
tied to one of its horns, it will fly about in the receiver, as long 
as the receiver continues full of air; but if the air be exhausted, 
though the animal will not die, and will continue to flutter its 
wings, it cannot remove itself from the place where it hangs in 
the middle of the receiver, until the air be let in again, and then 
the animal will fly about as before. 
20. Pour some quicksilver into the small bottle A, and screw 
the brass collar r of the tube B G into the brass neck 6 of the 
bottle, and the lower end of the tube will be immersed into the 
quicksilver, so that the air above the quicksilver in the bottle 
will be confined there, because it cannot get out about the join- 
ings, nor can it be drawn out through the quicksilver into the 
tube. This tube is also open at top, and is to be covered with 
K
-P-A-G-E-146
  130 THE TEACHING OF ree 
the receiver G and large tube E F, a, the is fixed by brass 
collars to the receiver, and is closed at the top. This preparation 
being made, exhaust the air both out of the receiver and its tube; 
and the air will, by the same means, be exhausted out of the inner 
tube B C, through its open top at C; and as the receiver and 
tubes are exhausting, the air that is confined in the glass bottle 
A will so press by its spring upon the surface of the quicksilver, 
as to force it up in the inner tube as high as it was raised in the 
ninth experiment by the pressure of the atmosphere; which 
demonstrates that the spring of the air is equivalent to its weight. 
21. Screw the end C of the pipe CD into the hole of the 
pump-plate, and turn all the three cocks d, G, and H, so as to 
open the communications between all the three pipes E, F, D C, 
and the hollow trunk AD. Then, cover the plates g and h with 
wet leathers, which have holes in their middle where the pipes 
open into the plates ; and place the close receiver I upon the plate 
g; this done, shut the pipe F by turning the cock H, and exhaust 
the air out of the receiver I. Then, turn the cock d to shut out 
the air, unscrew the machine from the pump, and having screwed 
it to the wooden foot L put the receiver K upon the plate h; 
this receiver will continue loose on the plate as long as it keeps 
full of air; which it will do until the cock H be turned to open 
the communication between the pipes F and E, through the trunk 
AB; and then the air in the receiver K, having nothing to act 
against its spring, will run from K into I, until it be so divided 
between these receivers, as to be of equal density in both; and 
then they will be held down with equal forces to their plates by 
the pressure of the atmosphere; though each receiver will then 
be kept down but with one-half of the pressure upon it, that the 
receiver I had, when it was exhausted of air; because it has now | 
one-half of the common air in it which filled the receiver K when 
it was set upon the plate; and therefore a force equal to half the 
force of the spring of common air, will act within the receivers 
against the whole pressure of the common air upon their out- 
sides. This is called transferring the air out of one vessel into 
another. 
22. Put a cork in the square phial A and fix it in with wax 
or cement; put the phial upon the pump-plate with the wire cage
-P-A-G-E-147
     THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 131 
B over it, and cover the cage with a close receiver. Then, ex- 
haust the air out of the receiver, and the air that is corked up 
in the phial will break the phial by the force of its spring, be- 
cause there is no air left on the outside of the phial to act against 
the air within it. 
28. Put a shrivelled apple under a close receiver, and exhaust 
the air; then the spring of the air within the apple will plump 
it out so as to cause all the wrinkles to disappear; but upon 
letting the air into the receiver again, to press upon the 
apple, it will instantly return to its former decayed and 
shrivelled state. 
24. Take a fresh egg, and cut off a little of the shell and film 
from its smallest end, then put the egg under a receiver, and 
pump out the air; upon this, all the contents in the egg will be 
forced out into the receiver, by the expansion of a small bubble 
of air contained in the greater end, between the shell and film. 
25. Put some warm beer into a glass, and having set it on 
the pump, cover it with a close receiver, and then exhaust the 
air. While this is doing, and thereby the pressure more and 
more taken off from the beer in the glass, the air therein will 
expand itself, rising up in innumerable bubbles to the surface 
of the beer; and from thence it will be taken away with the 
other air in the receiver. When the receiver is nearly exhausted, 
the air in the beer, which could not disentangle itself quick 
enough to get off with the rest, will now expand itself so as to 
cause the beer to have all the appearance of boiling; and the 
greatest part of it will go over the glass. 
Put some warm water into a glass, and put a bit of dry wainscot 
or other wood into the water. Then, cover the glass with a 
close receiver, and exhaust the air; upon this, the air in the wood 
having liberty to expand itself, will come out plentifully, and 
make all the water to bubble about the wood, especially about 
the ends, because the pores lie lengthwise. A cubic inch of dry 
wainscot has so much air in it, that it will continue bubbling 
for near half an hour together. 
Compare this rich treatment of an interesting and 
important subject with the present practice of con-

| 
fining the instruction upon it to a single laboratory 
exercise to prove that PXV is a constant, leaving the 
pupil without any idea that Boyle’s law is a matter 
of daily experience. Verily W. S. Franklin is quite 
right when he says : 
“My experience is, most emphatically, that a student may 
measure a thing and know nothing at all about it and I believe 
that the present high-school courses in elementary physics in 
which quantitative laboratory work is so strongly emphasized 
are altogether bad. . . . I believe that physical sciences should 
be taught in the secondary schools with reference primarily to 
their practical applications. . . . I cannot endure a so-called 
knowledge of elementary science which does not relate to some 
actual physical condition or thing . . . either you must create 
an actual world of the unusual phenomena of nature by purchas- 
ing an elaborate and expensive equipment of scientific apparatus 
or, you must make use of the boy’s everyday world of actual 
conditions and things.” 
Physics, as it is taught to-day, furnishes abundant 
material for an answer to Dr. Butler’s question, 
“Ts the present-day student brought understand- 
ingly and with ample introductory explanation into 
a new subject, or is he hurled into it and left to 
flounder helplessly until, not comprehending, he 
turns from it in disgust?” (Educational Review, 
Vol. 38, p. 519.) 
Since Ferguson’s time the world has made mighty 
advances in utilizing the “Spring of the Air,” but 
in the matter of instructing the youth on that point 
we have gone backward. Why do we not show them 
the “pressure tank” connected with the hydraulic 
elevator which is perhaps in the school building? 
The last time we looked at ours, the pressure gauge
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 133 
stood at 90 pounds and the water gauge enabled us 
to estimate that the volume of the air had been re- 
duced to about one-sixth of its normal volume. 
While we watched it the pressure rose and fell and 
the volume changed inversely — exact measure- 
ments upon this law are out of place in high school. 
So are all gas measurements with corrections for 
pressure and temperature changes. To show the 
relationship in round numbers is quite sufficient. 
A high-school pupil ought indeed to be taught the 
folly of one’s saying that his bicycle tire burst be- 
cause it was set in the sun. He ought to know that 
it would require a rise in temperature of nearly 500 
degrees F. to double its volume if the pressure 
remained constant. He ought to know that a bal- 
loon did not “fall into the river because the chilly 
air of the river contracted its gas’”’; but to verify, 
with the usual ado, the accuracy of the laws of Boyle 
and Charles is out of place in the high school, not 
because the exercise is too difficult but because it 
crowds out things of much more importance. The 
high-school pupil should know that gas is measured 
for commercial purposes without reference to these 
corrections, and he ought to be able to estimate how 
insignificant the corrections would be in his gas 
bills, if they were made. 
A similar illustration of how principles of physics 
may be well taught by calling attention to a large 
number of familiar experiences is to be found in Dr. 
Neil Arnott’s book on Natural Philosophy written 
eighty years ago as follows:
-P-A-G-E-150
  184 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Action and Reaction 
If a man in one boat pull at the rope attached to another, the 
two boats will approach. If they be of equal size and load, they 
will both move at the same rate, in whichever of the boats the 
man may be; and if there be a difference in the sizes, and resist- 
ances, there will be a corresponding difference in the velocities, 
the smaller boat moving the fastest. 
A magnet and a piece of iron attract each other equally, what- 
ever disproportion there is between the masses. If either be 
balanced in a scale, and the other be then brought within a cer- 
tain distance beneath it, the very same counterpoise will be re- 
quired to prevent their approach, whichever be in the scale. If 
the two were hanging near each other as pendulums, they would 
approach and meet; but the little one would perform a greater 
part of the journey, in proportion to its littleness. 
A man in a boat pulling a rope attached to a large ship, 
seems only to move the boat; but he really moves the ship 
a little, for a thousand men in a thousand boats, pulling 
simultaneously in the same way, would make the ship meet 
them halfway. 
A pound of lead and the earth attract each other with equal 
force; but that force makes the lead approach sixteen feet in a 
second towards the earth, while the contrary motion of the earth 
is of course as much less than this as the earth is weightier than 
one pound, and is therefore unnoticed. Strictly, however, it is 
true, that even a feather falling lifts the earth towards it, and 
that a man jumping kicks the earth away. 
A spring, unbending between two equal bodies, throws them 
off with equal velocity; if between bodies of different magni- 
tudes, the velocity is greater in the smaller body, and in exact 
proportion to the smallness. 
On firing a cannon, the gun recoils with as much motion or 
momentum in it as the ball has; but the momentum in the gun 
being diffused through a greater mass, the velocity is small, and 
easily checked. 
The recoil of a light fowling-piece will hurt the shoulder, if 
the piece be not held close to it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-151

A ship in chase, by firing her bow guns, retards her motion; 
by firing from the stern she quickens it. 
A ship firing a broadside, heels or inclines to the other side. 
A vessel of water suspended by a cord hangs perpendicularly ; 
but if a hole be opened on one side, so as to allow the water to 
jet out there, the vessel will be pushed to the other side by the 
reaction of the jet, and will so remain while it flows. If the hole 
be oblique, the vessel will turn round constantly. 
A vessel of water placed upon a floating piece of plank, and 
allowed to throw out a jet, as in the last case, moves the plank 
in the opposite direction. 
A steam-boat may be driven by making the engine pump or 
squirt water from the stern, instead of, as usual, moving paddle 
wheels. There is a loss of power, however, in this mode of ap- 
plying it, as will be explained under the head of “‘ Hydraulics.” 
A man floating in a small boat, and blowing strongly with a 
bellows toward the stern, pushes himself onwards with the same 
force with which the air issues from the bellows pipe. 
A sky-rocket ascends, because, after it is lighted, the lower 
part is always producing a large quantity of aeriform fluid, which, 
in expanding, presses not only on the air below, but also on the 
rocket above, and thus lifts it. The ascent is aided also by the 
recoil of the rocket from the part of its substance, which is con- 
stantly being shot downwards. 
He was a foolish man who thought he had found the means 
of commanding always a fair wind for his pleasure-boat, by erect- 
ing an immense bellows in the stern. The bellows and sails acted 
against each other, and there was no motion; indeed, in a perfect 
calm, there would be a little backward motion, because the sail 
would not catch all the wind from the bellows. 
A man using an oar, or a steam-engine turning paddle wheels, 
advances exactly with the force that drives the water astern. 
A swimmer pressing the water downwards and backwards with 
his hands, is sent forwards and upwards with the same force by 
the re-action of the water. 
And a bird flying is upheld with exactly the force with which 
it strikes the air in the opposite direction. 
A man pushing against the ground with a stick, may be con-

  136 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
sidered as compressing a spring between the earth and the end of 
his stick, which spring is therefore pushing up as much as he 
pushes down; and if, at the time, he were balanced in the scale 
of a weighing beam, he would find that he weighed just as much 
less as if he were pressing with his stick. 
Thus an invalid, on a spring plank or chair, who causes his 
body to rise and fall through a great range, by a trifling down- 
ward pressure of his hand on a staff or on a table, and thus 
obtains the advantage of almost passive exercise, is really lifting 
himself while he presses downward. 
When a child cries, on knocking his head against a table or a 
pane of glass, it is common to tell him, and it is true, that he has 
given as hard blows as he has received ; although his philosophy, 
attending chiefly to results, probably blames the table for his 
head hurt, and his head for the glass broken. 
The difference of momentum acquired in a fall of one foot or 
of several, is well known; the corresponding intensities of re- 
action are unpleasantly experienced by a man who, in sitting 
down, is quietly received into a chair, or who unexpectedly 
reaches the floor where he supposed a chair to be. 
What motion the wind has given to a ship, it has itself lost, 
that is to say, the ship has re-acted on the moving air; as is seen 
when one vessel is becalmed under the lee of another. 
When a billiard ball strikes directly another ball of equal size, 
it stops, and the second ball proceeds with the whole velocity 
which the first had — the action which imparts the new motion 
here being equal to the re-action which destroys the old. Al- 
though the transference of motion, in such a case, seems to be 
instantaneous, the change is really progressive, and is as fol- 
lows: The approaching ball, at a certain point of time, has 
just given half of its motion to the other equal ball, and if both 
were of soft clay, they would then proceed together with half 
the original velocity ; but, as they are elastic, the touching parts 
at the moment supposed, are compressed like a spring between 
the balls, and by then expanding, and exerting force equally 
both ways, they double the velocity of the foremost ball, and 
destroy altogether the motion in the other. 
If a billiard ball be propelled against the nearest one of a row
-P-A-G-E-153
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 137 
of balls equal to itself, it comes to rest as in the last case de- 
scribed, while the farthest ball of the row darts off with its 
velocity, the intermediate balls having each received and trans- 
mitted the motion in a twinkling, without appearing themselves 
to move. 
This method of treatment may be illustrated further 
by the following “ projects,” one on Controlling Fires 
and the other on Eggs. 
Controlling Fires 
During all the life of man upon the earth, down 
to even the last century, fires have been little under- 
stood. They have inspired awe and terror and have 
been objects of superstitious veneration. 
It is to be noted that men know facts a long 
time before they acquire the habit of acting accord- 
ing to that knowledge. Do all people know that 
air makes the fire burn? How shall we interpret 
the following incident, which is typical of hun- 
dreds of others occurring daily ? 
“While preparing her husband’s dinner on a gas-range in the 
kitchen of their home, Mrs. —— placed the sleeve of her dress 
too near the gas flame and was soon a mass of flames. As 
her husband reached the kitchen door he saw his wife run out into 
the hall screaming wildly. She ran down the stairway, shedding 
flaming fragments of her dress as she went. The husband did 
not overtake her until she had reached the hallway of the first 
floor, and was trying to open the door to go into the street. He 
rolled her on the floor, and stripped the remnants of the burn- 
ing dress from her body. In the meantime the pieces of burn- 
ing cloth had ignited the stair carpet between the second and 
third floors, and the hall began to fill with smoke. The other 
tenants were aroused, and while one went to summon an am- 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
    
      138 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
  bulance another turned in an alarm of fire. At the hospital 
Mrs. —— is said to be in a serious condition.” 
A most common headline in the daily news is 
Burned in the Sight of Many. Two recent accounts 
tell of women stepping upon matches upon the side- 
walk, and while their clothes were in flame, not one 
of the onlookers knew what to do except to call a 
fire-engine or a policeman. 
Little children whose clothes have caught fire 
are seized in the arms of distracted mothers who 
run about with them doing nothing but fanning the 
flames. 
We continue to build costly structures of kindling 
wood on which as a matter of course we pay exces- 
sive rates of insurance, oblivious of the fact that a 
considerable number of these buildings become 
annually the funeral pyres of multitudes. Our an- 
nual loss by fire in the United States, including cost 
of fire departments and cost of insurance, exceeds 
two hundred million dollars, and is equal to that of 
all other countries combined. 
The art of controlling fires requires that one should 
know how to build them, to regulate them, and to 
extinguish them at will. A fireman in a large 
building may save or waste many times his wages 
according as he understands the control of fires. 
It is a case where beyond all doubt the most ex- 
pensive men are the cheapest. 
The management of gas and gasoline engines re- 
quires first of all a knowledge of combustion. If 
each person had a practical knowledge of combus- 
tion, such as any person beyond the primary-school  
-P-A-G-E-155
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 139 
age may acquire, nine-tenths of the destructive fires 
would not occur, and half the fuel, now wasted by 
the ignorant stoking of stoves and furnaces, would 
be saved. 
A course in chemistry may teach one to say “‘oxy- 
gen is a supporter of combustion” without adding 
anything to his stock of useful knowledge about 
combustion. He may increase his erudition by 
“O=16” and “Sp. gr.=1.1056” ete., without being 
any wiser to act in case of the house being on fire. 
Suppose we invert a bottle over a burning candle. 
The flame burns for a short time and then goes out. 
Lift the bottle, light the candle, and replace the 
bottle. The flame is immediately extinguished. 
Before the experiment the bottle contained air, 
which consists of nitrogen, etc., 80 per cent, and 
oxygen 20 per cent.; after the experiment it con- 
tained nitrogen, etc., 80 per cent, oxygen 15 per 
cent and carbon dioxide 5 per cent. The presence 
of the latter gas is shown by pouring a little lime- 
water into the bottle. Note that it turns the lime- 
water milk white. Air in which one-quarter of the 
oxygen has been replaced by carbon dioxide will ex- 
tinguish a flame. It will also extinguish life. Hence 
a lantern is lowered into old wells to determine 
whether it would be safe for a man to descend into 
them. The air which comes from one’s lungs is 
very nearly like that in the bottle after the above 
experiment. A bottleful of air from the lungs will 
extinguish a candle flame. 
From the beginning of history to the time of the 
Swedish chemist Stahl, in the latter part of the
-P-A-G-E-156
  140 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
seventeenth century, fire was considered an element. 
For about one hundred years previous to the re- 
searches of the French chemist Lavoisier, in 1878, 
it was believed that fuels were composed of ashes 
and a ghostly thing called phlogiston. Combustion 
according to this theory was the art of decomposing 
the fuels and setting free the phlogiston. We now 
know that fuels in burning unite with the oxygen 
of the air, forming new compounds. For example, 
when we burn in an ordinary furnace 15 tons of 
coal the furnace also consumes about 32 tons of 
oxygen from the air, and pours out into the air 
about 44 tons of carbon dioxide gas, leaving behind 
about 3 tons of ashes. These figures, although not 
exact, are intended to convey two ideas: (1) that 
combustion is a union of oxygen with fuels, and (2) 
that the process neither destroys nor creates matter, 
but merely changes combinations of matter. The 
oxygen is quite as much fuel as the coal is. It is 
very fortunate that the steamer has to carry only 
about one-third of the fuel it must burn, and for- 
tunate that by far the largest part of the products 
of combustion dispose of themselves. Merely to 
shovel the coal into the furnace and the ashes out is 
a sufficiently large task. 
In the case of the candle, and also in the case of 
the coal, water vapor is produced as a product of 
combustion along with the carbon dioxide. It may 
be noticed that when the bottle is first inverted over 
the candle a slight cloud of moisture forms upon 
the cool glass. 
Breathe into a wide-mouthed bottle and notice
-P-A-G-E-157
  
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 141 
first how the moisture gathers upon the sides of 
the glass. Afterwards add limewater to show the 
presence of the carbon dioxide produced. 
Our foods correspond to fuels and we take in also 
oxygen as a food or a fuel. By a process analogous 
to combustion we cause oxygen to unite with these 
foods, producing water vapor, carbon dioxide, and 
heat for our bodies. 
When a bottle of oxygen is placed over a burning 
candle, the candle of course burns brighter and longer 
but goes out before all the oxygen is exhausted. The 
contents of the bottle now acts as a fire extinguisher 
although it contains as much oxygen as ever. Part 
of the oxygen is now bound in chemical union 
with carbon from the candle, and the oxygen which 
is free does not constitute a sufficiently large portion 
of the whole to support combustion. The presence 
of carbon dioxide and water vapor may be shown as 
before. 
As might be expected, many things burn vigorously 
in pure oxygen which burn but slowly or not at all 
in the air, since the air is greatly diluted oxygen. 
A thin strip of iron may be burned with great vigor 
in oxygen. The reddish-brown powder which will 
be found covering the sides of the bottle after the 
close of this experiment is iron rust. It weighs con- 
siderably more than the iron which was burned and 
the increase of weight represents the oxygen which 
was burned. Combustion and rusting differ only 
in the rapidity of the action. Combustion is rapid 
rusting, and rusting is slow combustion. Both are 
called oxidation and the products are called oxides.  
-P-A-G-E-158
  142 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
The oxidation of our foods in our bodies is slow — 
more like rusting than combustion. 
We cover iron with various things to prevent the 
oxygen of the air from rusting it. It is covered with 
tin in the tinware of the kitchen, with zinc in the 
case of “galvanized” iron, with nickel, with porce- 
lain, with paint, with grease, with vaseline, etc. 
Drop a match into a flask and warm the flask 
gently ; the combustion of the match begins at its 
phosphorus end at a very low temperature. After 
the flame has gone out put the charred portion of 
the match into another flask and heat. It will be 
found to have a very much higher kindling tem- 
perature than before, but nevertheless it has a kin- 
dling temperature. Before matches were invented 
about one hundred years ago, people were greatly 
troubled to start a fire. It was so difficult to raise 
fuels to the kindling temperature that generally 
they preferred to keep a “‘seed of fire” over from 
one time to another, and would usually borrow fire 
from their neighbors rather than go to the trouble 
of starting a new one, which must be done by strik- 
ing sparks with a flint and file and igniting tinder. 
Explosive mixtures. Fill a 32-ounce narrow- 
mouthed bottle with a mixture of one part illumi- 
nating gas to five parts of air. Explode. Try other 
proportions and see how narrow is the limit for 
explosion. Note that in the case of an explosion 
the flame shoots through the whole mass instantly, 
each small portion of gas having next to it the 
oxygen necessary for combustion, and the burning 
of any part heats the neighboring parts to their
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 143 
kindling temperature. The kindling temperature of 
the mixture is about as hot as red-hot iron. Our 
experience teaches us that gas may leak into the 
air until the odor is very strong without its being 
possible to explode it with a flame. The fact is that 
if, in a mixture of gas and air, the gas constitutes 
much less than one-seventh or more than one-fifth 
of the mixture an explosion cannot take place. 
When the best proportions are reached the color of 
the flame during explosion is blue like that of a gas 
stove or a Bunsen burner. 
In a 32-ounce narrow-mouthed bottle put four 
drops of gasoline; cork and let it mix with the air 
in the bottle and finally explode it. It will be 
found that a drop or two more or less will prevent 
the explosion. If less, nothing will happen; if more, 
the contents of the bottle will quietly burn at the 
mouth. 
It is a marvel that a small two-horse-power marine 
engine may explode 1000 times a minute, when it is 
considered that for each explosion 4 drops of gasoline 
must be vaporized, the vapor must be thoroughly 
mixed with about one quart of air, the products of 
the previous explosion must be swept out of the 
cylinder, the fresh mixture must be taken in and 
compressed to about one-fifth of its original volume, 
and at the right instant an electric spark must be 
produced to raise a portion of the mixture to its 
kindling temperature. When one considers that 
all of this must be repeated one thousand times a 
minute, it is not strange that those who first pro- 
posed such a machine were considered erratic. 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
144 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Try four drops of kerosene in place of the gaso- 
line. It will not explode, simply because kerosene 
is not volatile at ordinary temperature and, in 
spite of all we hear to the contrary, kerosene lamps 
do not explode. Now place the bottle containing 
four drops of kerosene and air in a kettle of hot 
water heated to at least 150 degrees F., and at that 
temperature the kerosene will be found to be vola- 
tile like gasoline. After a few minutes it may be 
exploded. Gas stoves, Bunsen burners, and Wels- 
bach lamps are all devices for getting as near to the 
explosive mixture as possible without quite reaching 
it. When the mixture comes within the narrow 
limits of from 14 per cent to 20 per cent gas, the 
flame “strikes back.’ If the proportion of gas is 
much above 20 per cent the flame becomes yellow 
and is not so hot. A larger supply of air is needed 
to give more perfect combustion and therefore more 
heat and no formation of smoke or other partially 
burned products. 
The purpose of all draughts and dampers about 
stoves and furnaces is to regulate the supply of air 
and therefore the rate of combustion. 
Teachers College is now (1910) burning 6500 tons 
of coal a year. The engines and radiators call for 
a certain number of heat units per year. A little 
bad management of the fires might result in sending 
the products of combustion up the chimney half 
burned and require double the consumption of coal 
to produce the same result. The coal bill would then 
of course be increased about $15,000, and this is not 
the whole story, but enough for our present purpose.
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 145 
In fighting a fire at its start, the one thing to do 
is to make it smother itself as the candle did in the 
bottle in our first experiment. An ordinary living 
room does not contain oxygen enough to burn up 
five pounds of wood. If the doors and windows are 
closed perfectly tight, a fire burning in a pile of dry 
kindlings in such a room will smolder for a time and 
go out precisely as the candle did in the bottle of 
the first experiment. 
Some years ago I had the good fortune to hold in 
check for two hours a fire which had started upon a 
pile of kindlings in the basement of a school build- 
ing full of pupils. The fire had a good start before 
it was discovered and the pile of kindlings was large. 
When the windows and doors were closed it smol- 
dered down, almost checked by its own smoke, but 
enough air leaked into the room to keep a seed of 
fire, which started up into a lively blaze whenever 
the door was opened. There was no water except 
such as might be brought in pails. Having mar- 
shaled out the pupils, we gathered a good many 
pails of water in the room above and prepared to 
cut a hole through the floor with an ax, knowing 
that the moment the hole was cut our water must 
completely extinguish the fire, or it would envelop 
the whole building in flames very quickly. The 
hole was cut, the water was successfully applied and 
the fire was extinguished, when it was found that 
although a considerable portion of the kindlings 
had been blackened, none had been thoroughly 
charred. 
This experience should be compared with another 
L 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
   
   146 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
in which a fire was discovered in the early morning 
in the basement of an apartment house. The maid 
in the basement rushed outdoors, leaving the door 
open, and shouted “‘Fire!’? Those upstairs, when 
they attempted to descend, found smoke in the halls, 
and returned to open their windows and shout 
“Fire!” Before the fire department could arrive the 
building was in flames and eight persons were burned 
to death. 
In an iron kettle, put some gasoline and set fire 
to it. When the flame is burning high, lay over it 
the pot lid. The fire is instantly extinguished be- 
cause, no matter how combustible it is, it cannot 
burn without the requisite oxygen. Compare this 
with what happened not long ago. A woman was 
heating a pot of fat for frying crullers, when it took 
fire. She heroically seized the flaming pot by its 
bail and rushed to the sink and turned into the burn- 
ing fat a stream of water which of course went to 
the bottom, floated the fat, and distributed the 
fire all over the kitchen. 
A burning kerosene lamp was upset in the midst 
of books and paper piled upon a library table. No 
one was home but children. The oldest boy ordered 
his younger brothers and sisters to bring him all 
the rugs they could lay hold of. He stationed one 
child to keep the library door shut, while he, hold- 
ing his breath, rushed in and laid a rug over the fire 
and came out to get a breath of fresh air. This 
performance was repeated until the fire was entirely 
out. 
A little girl was playing on the lawn near where  
-P-A-G-E-163
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 147 
her brothers were celebrating the Fourth of July, 
when a firecracker, thrown into her lap, set fire to 
her dress. Her mother, who was looking on from 
the piazza, caught her in her arms and rushed with 
her into the house, where the fire was finally ex- 
tinguished, but not until the child had been fatally 
burned. 
A four-year-old girl played with a match until 
it took fire, and in her fright she dropped it into her 
lap. No one was in the room with her at the time, 
but soon after her mother came in and found the 
child holding her dress gathered into a tight wad in 
her lap. When she induced her to release it she 
found a hole nearly a foot square burned out of the 
front of the dress, but no other damage done — not 
even were the little hands burned at all. She 
had many times been taught what to do if her 
clothes caught fire. 
Most fire extinguishers are devices for producing 
carbon dioxide. With this they smother small 
fires by pouring into the atmosphere around them 
enough of the gas to reduce the proportion of 
oxygen below 15 per cent. 
Streams of water, when thrown in sufficient 
quantity, as by fire engines, extinguish large fires 
both by cooling the fuel below its kindling tem- 
perature and by diluting the air with steam until 
the proportion of oxygen falls below 15 per cent. 
One of the most effective ways of extinguishing a 
fire is to separate the burning fuel into small por- 
tions. Thus a considerable fire in a fireplace may 
be quickly extinguished by merely distributing apart
-P-A-G-E-164
    148 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
from each other the burning embers. Their mutual 
heat is required to keep them above the kindling 
temperature. A shovelful of burning coals when 
taken from the furnace soon cool below their kin- 
dling temperature. The heat of the rest of the coal 
is necessary to keep them burning. 
The fireman’s ax and pick enable him to extinguish 
fire by separating in small pieces the burning parts 
of wood in floor or wainscot of buildings. When 
thus treated, the wood soon falls below its kindling 
temperature. 
Eggs 
Problems to be solved by the pupils, mostly by 
experiments at home or in the laboratory. 
May we determine the age of an egg by its 
specific gravity? Procure an egg laid within 24 
hours. Write its date upon it and place a number 
upon it to designate it. Attach a thread to its 
large end by a little sealing wax. (If you cannot 
think why it should be attached to the large end 
rather than the small end, try it attached to the 
small end and continue with it so until you get an 
answer to the question.) Find the specific gravity 
of the egg and weigh it each day thereafter for a 
month or six weeks. The egg may be kept in the 
laboratory or any living room all this time. See if 
you note any connection between the weight of the 
egg and the state of the weather each day. Some 
of our records are as follows: 
Egg No. 6, Feb. 3, 1909. Wt. in air, 60.17 gms.

On Feb. 22d it floated on water. It was not 
dipped in water after Feb. 3d. The date when this 
egg was laid was not known. 
On clear days it lost more than on damp days. 
This egg was broken on Feb. 24th and appeared 
to be perfectly fresh. It was allowed to dry natu- 
rally for two days and then was rubbed up to a 
powder, which is still in good condition (Jan. 12, 
1910), 
Egg No. 1, laid Feb. 25, 1909. Wt. 58.62 gms. 
Wt. in water, 6.06 gms. Sp. Gr. 1.115. On April 
7th it weighed 52.46 gms. and floated on water. 
It lost an average of .15 gm. a day and required 41 
days for it to become light enough to float. It was 
a yellow egg and apparently rather thick shelled.  
-P-A-G-E-166
  150 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Grocers report that yellow eggs are preferred in the 
Boston market and white eggs are preferred in the 
New York market. 
Egg No. 2. Wt. 53.72. Sp. Gr. 1.096. Average 
loss in wt. per day .17 gm. Floated in 28 days. 
Egg No. 3. Wt. 44.89. Sp. Gr. 1.091. Average 
loss in wt. per day .1 gm. Floated in 34 days. 
Egg No. 4. Wt. 62.06. Sp. Gr. 1.098. Average 
loss in wt. per day .15 gm. Floated in 37 days. 
Eggs Nos. 1 to 4 were all laid within 24 hours of 
the beginning of the experiments with them. 
These eggs differ so much in specific gravity (from 
1.091 to 1.115) and the rate of evaporation from them 
is so different (from .11 to .17) that the age could 
not have been told at all closely by the specific 
gravity. This much, however, may be concluded 
from our experiments: all fresh eggs sink in water. 
Eggs which float in water are at least a month or 
six weeks old and have been kept in a dry room (ex- 
cept that infected eggs may spoil in a fortnight, 
generate hydrogen sulphide gas, and float). Eggs 
which are not infected (and few appear to be) do 
not spoil. They simply dry up. The air space ap- 
pears at the big end and grows larger and larger. 
The average egg must lose about 5 gms. before it 
will float, and this will require about five weeks in 
dry atmosphere. Eggs may be kept in moist at- 
mosphere without losing weight, or put to soak in 
water and again recover weight which they may 
have lost. 
Eggs are sometimes dipped in a diluted solution 
of water-glass to prevent evaporation and also to
-P-A-G-E-167
  
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 151 
prevent infection. Some persons preserve them 
by dipping them in boiling water for a second. 
A newly laid egg not only sinks in water but lies 
down flat on its side. After a week or two, if it is 
kept in dry air, the large end will rise a little when it 
is put in water, on account of the development of 
the air space in that end. In three or four weeks it 
will stand on its small end at the bottom of a tumbler 
of water. In four to six weeks it will float on water. 
An egg that is recently laid will sink in a solution 
of one teaspoonful of salt in a tumbler of water. 
Put hydrochloric acid upon a piece of eggshell. 
Pass the gas into limewater. Put some white of 
egg into alcohol. Find the temperature at which 
the white of an egg coagulates. Heat some white 
of egg in a test tube with a strip of lead paper at its 
mouth. Action on silver spoons. Why does a 
dropped egg cook quicker than an egg in the shell? 
How does it happen that an egg put into boiling 
water in a small cup to cook four minutes is soft 
boiled while if put into a large vessel of boiling 
water for the same time may be well done? Dis- 
solve out some of the fat from the yolk of an egg 
by means of ether. Produce some black charcoal 
from the white of an egg. Weigh the white of an 
egg in an evaporating dish. Let it dry two days 
and when it is thoroughly dry weigh again to find 
out what proportion of it was water.

WHAT SPECIALIZATION HAS DONE FOR 
PHYSICS TEACHING? 
In his presidential address before the British 
Association last summer Sir J. J. Thomson, speaking 
of overspecialization at Cambridge University, said : 
“Premature specialization injures the student by depriving 
him of adequate literary culture... . It retards the progress 
of science by tending to isolate one science from another. The 
boundaries between the sciences are arbitrary, and tend to 
disappear as science progresses. The principles of one science 
often find most striking and suggestive illustrations in the 
phenomena of another.” 
It is time to inquire whether early specialization 
among undergraduates in American colleges is 
unfitting them both for research and for teaching. 
The theory still prevails in college that it is good 
to know more than one thing, otherwise there would 
be no minors, but minors, according to our closely 
differentiated scheme, are little else than divisions 
of the major subject. The result appears to be 
that we are producing graduates whose outlook is 
too limited to enable them to carry on a piece 
of original research. They become research assist-

ants with little prospect of ever being very success- 
ful at independent work. 
L. H. Baekeland in Science, Vol. 25, p. 845, says : 
“T challenge you to name any truly great man who was 
merely a speciajist. . . . One-sided pursuits are apt to make 
us very narrow-minded. ... Overspecialized science is apt 
to degenerate into a mere hobby where all conception of true 
proportions and harmony are lost.” 
The evil of early specialization is particularly 
apparent when we consider the cause of education 
— especially that within the college walls. Not 
only has the régime signally failed to qualify young 
men for teaching, but there has grown up along 
with it a distaste for and even a disrespect for teach- 
ing. There are about 150,000 undergraduate stu- 
dents who annually contract with the colleges of 
the land for instruction, but no one seems to want 
to teach them. The colleges announce a full staff 
of instructors — the title still remains — but it is 
difficult to find a college instructor, educated within 
the last ten or fifteen years, who makes it his chief 
interest to teach or who likes to acknowledge that 
it is his chief business. When asked what he is 
doing he tries to think of some little piece of research, 
however insignificant, and he shows impatience and 
evident embarrassment if obliged to say that he is 
engaged chiefly in teaching. 
President Hadley of Yale, speaking at Johns 
Hopkins University, February 22, 1909, on “The 
Danger of Overspecialization,” said : 
“Tt is not enough to discover truth, we must make it known 
among the citizens of this self-governing commonwealth. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  154 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
college is ceasing to have the influence which it ought to have 
upon the world.” | 
From the New York Times, December 20, 1909: 
“President Lowell, of Harvard, has expressed himself as 
heartily in favor of bringing the college course nearer to the 
practical concerns of the community. ‘A university,’ he 
says, ‘to be of any great-value, must grow out of the community 
in which it lives and must be in absolute touch with the com- 
munity, doing all the good it can and doing what the community 
needs. Any institution which is not in absolutely close touch 
with the community about it is doomed to wither and die.’ ” 
New York State, which is typical, has about 
800 high schools and probably there are not a dozen 
teachers outside of New York City who are employed 
in these high schools to teach physics alone. Still, 
when a young man goes to college with the inten- 
tion of fitting himself to teach in one of those high 
schools he is compelled to choose a major subject, 
and if it be physics, for example, his adviser will 
steer him through a course so highly specialized in 
physics and so devoid of other things that he is 
quite unfit to teach anything, and especially a 
general beginners’ course. Among the courses in 
physics which he takes none will have reference to 
the experiences of life, but each will be a distinct 
attempt to prepare for the next technical course 
beyond. Even if his duty was to teach physics 
alone he would not know enough about chemistry 
and other allied sciences to teach physics properly. 
But what does the college course do for the 750 high 
schools of New York State in which one person has 
to teach all the sciences? Or what does it do for the
-P-A-G-E-171
  SPECIALIZATION AND PHYSICS TEACHING 155 
570 high schools which have only three teachers, 
or less, apiece, and in which some one has to teach 
more than all the sciences? No one, however, can 
visit many of these schools without reaching the 
conclusion that some of them have excellent physics 
teaching. In some cases the credit for this is due 
to the state normal schools, and in some schools the 
physics teaching appears to be good because they 
are not trying to fit for college. 
'» One cannot read the papers of to-day without 
feeling that the community is on the point of mak- 
ing great changes in its educational institutions. 
It appears to want undergraduate students to take 
general courses in several sciences. It wants these 
courses to be far more general than any courses 
now are. It will doubtless insist that these courses 
shall be given by men who can teach, and who are 
willing to devote their best efforts to it. A genera- 
tion or so ago the greatest men in all the colleges 
were great teachers. With the establishment of 
universities and the encouragement of research 
came the decadence of teaching. It is to be hoped 
that both research and teaching will be fostered in 
the future. If, however, things go on as at present, 
it seems probable that the revival of teaching will 
be brought about by separating the research func- 
tion from that of teaching. 
Our present scheme of science teaching was 
founded upon educational theories which are not 
now entertained. We thought that by drill we could 
develop certain faculties which would functionize 
in other fields when called upon to do so. What- 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  156 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
ever faculties the college teacher thought his pupils 
ought to have, these he made it the duty of the high- 
school teacher to produce. We thought high-school 
pupils might be trained in observation, in accuracy, 
etc. We thought they might be equipped with a 
catalogue of fundamental principles and laws, the 
use of which might appear when they got to college. 
We thought it possible to teach one single science 
thoroughly, and we said much about teaching pupils 
to be scientific by concentration upon one thing 
and we spoke slightingly of the general courses. 
It now seems probable that a man trained to con- 
servatism in one field is no less likely to be a wild- 
cat in some other field. It has been pointed out 
that in matters of education, and particularly in 
the matter of prescribing work for the high schools, 
the college physicists have been strangely unscientific, 
dealing with snap judgments when reliable data 
were not at hand; prescribing out of ignorance 
where a council of doctors would have been baffled. 
Who knows that the high-school pupil has reached 
the time of life when he can be trained in exact 
science without doing him violence? The com- 
munity wants its young people informed about the 
interpretations which may be put upon the phenom- 
ena and experiences of daily life. The attempt 
to make pupils scientific before their time may pre- 
vent their ever becoming scientific. Intolerance 
of those who have the gift of imagination may lead 
one to try to suppress a Davy or a Maxwell. 
Public dissatisfaction with the teaching of to-day 
is expressed by many. Let me quote a few.
-P-A-G-E-173
  SPECIALIZATION AND PHYSICS TEACHING 157 
L. B. Avery, of California : 
“Physics is the most fundamental in its conceptions and the 
most practical in its applications of all the sciences. The 
proposition to leave any portion of those who take a complete 
high school course with no knowledge of it is in itself a com- 
plete acknowledgment of the educational inadequacy of the 
present methods.” 
L. H. Bailey, of Cornell : 
“Distinguish between the teaching function and the research 
function. We are teachers. It is our business to open the 
minds of the young to the facts of science. . . . Nature study 
is a new mode of teaching, not a new subject. It is just as 
applicable to the college as to the common school. ... We 
should be interested more in the student than in the science.” 
T. M. Balliet, of New York University, in School 
Review, Vol. 16, p. 217, has an exceedingly good 
article, but too long to quote, on ‘The [evil] Influ- 
ence of Present Methods of Graduate Instruction on 
the Teaching in Secondary Schools.” 
W. S. Franklin, of Lehigh : 
“My experience is, most emphatically, that a student may 
measure a thing and know nothing at all about it and I believe 
that the present high school courses in elementary physics in 
which quantitative laboratory work is so strongly emphasized, 
are altogether bad. . . . I believe that physical sciences should 
be taught in the secondary schools with reference primarily to 
their practical applications. . . . I cannot endure a so-called 
knowledge of elementary science which does not relate to some 
actual physical condition or thing. ... Either you must 
create an actual world of the unusual phenomena of nature by 
purchasing an elaborate and expensive equipment of scientific 
apparatus, or you must make use of the boy’s everyday world of 
actual conditions and things.”
-P-A-G-E-174
    158 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
David Starr Jordan, of Leland Stanford Uni- 
versity : 
“For colleges to specify certain classes of subjects regardless 
of the real interest of the secondary schools and their pupils is 
a species of impertinence which only tradition justifies. ... In 
general, the high-school graduate who has a training worth 
while in the conduct of life is also well fitted to enter college for 
further training. The average American boy quits the high 
school in disgust because he cannot interpret its work in terms 
of life.” 
S. V. Kellerman : 
“Only by teaching honestly what the world needs, and can 
use, may the schools accomplish their lofty aims.” 
No one has stated the dissatisfaction with present 
practices more justly than Principal W. D. Lewis 
in the Outlook, December 11, 1909, in an article 
entitled “College Domination of High Schools,” 
from which I make an extract or two. 
“The high school is failing in its mission because its methods 
and scope of instruction are determined by college entrance 
examinations made by specialists whose point of view is not the 
welfare of the student, but the (supposed) requirements for 
advanced study of certain subjects. . . . Our present college- 
dictated high-school course is ill adapted to the real needs of 
the people in that it places the emphasis on the wrong subjects, 
and practically eliminates those that would be of the greatest 
practical value in the lives of the vast majority of pupils whose 
only opportunity for higher education is in the public high school. 
No less destructive of the welfare of the masses is the limita- 
tion in method of treatment of the subjects taught. . . . Col- 
lege teachers have written the courses, trained the teachers, set 
the examinations, and execrated the results.”

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE REQUIRE- 
MENTS IN PHYSICS OF THE COLLEGE 
ENTRANCE EXAMINATION BOARD! 
Puysics is poorly taught in the colleges — quite 
as poorly taught in the colleges as in the high 
schools. 
The duty of fitting the colleges for the high-school 
graduates is quite as urgent as that of fitting the 
high-school pupils for the colleges. 
The colleges should prepare teachers of physics 
for the high schools but those who are most recently 
come from college are the most conspicuously unfit 
for teaching high-school pupils. 
These conditions must be kept in mind when 
preparing a syllabus of work for high schools. 
By years of contact with high-school problems 
some college graduates who are capable of adapta- 
tion have been transmuted into good teachers of 
physics. Such were the six high-school men chosen 
by the College Entrance Examination Board to pre- 
pare the present syllabus. 
With the clear understanding of conditions as 
they exist at present, they did the wisest thing that

could be done under the circumstances. Education 
must be a conservative thing. Changes must not 
amount to a revolution. What these men did 
was a step in the right direction, and a sufficiently 
long step to be practicable, yet it is not the end of 
progress toward better things, it is merely a small 
beginning. 
It is worth while to remind ourselves that the so- 
called College Entrance Board is not in reality a 
college entrance board. It is merely an examina- 
tion bureau. It has gradually succeeded in getting 
its certificate accepted for entrance by most of the 
colleges just as the regents of the state of New York 
have done, but unlike the regents this board could 
not continue to exist if its requirements on examina- 
tions did not conform pretty closely to what the 
colleges demand. Its real name is, The College 
Entrance Examination Board — with the emphasis 
on examination. By calling it as we do, for short, 
the College Entrance Board, we sometimes mislead 
ourselves as to its importance. It cannot be expected 
to be so much a leader as a follower in educational 
progress. The committee was well aware of the 
restricted functions of the board and_ therefore 
committed it to no embarrassing position. 
On the other hand, this board as an exponent of 
the colleges makes it known that the colleges have 
now for the first time become ready to recognize 
the fact that the high schools are better able than 
the colleges to determine what should be expected 
of high-school pupils. It behooves the high schools 
to get ready for some constructive work and to take 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  COLLEGE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 161 
a step forward each year in the matter of these physics 
requirements. 
Let us first examine the report of this committee 
and see what changes they have made and then 
consider the next changes which should be con- 
templated. 
The greatest hindrance to good teaching is not 
the syllabus. That, like all codes of law, is capable 
of many interpretations. and may by exegesis be 
made to justify all practices; not the examiners, 
for under the régime of the College Entrance Exami- 
nation Board they have usually been broad-minded 
men, and at any rate their sole function is to frame 
questions — which again are ‘capable of many 
interpretations — but the real block upon high- 
school teaching is the readers and raters of examina- 
tion papers and laboratory notebooks. These men 
are a law unto themselves and their rules of conduct 
have never been published. It is certain that they 
have not the same outlook upon education as the 
board has or as its examiners have, and it is equally 
certain that they exert ten times as much power as 
either the board or the examiners in shaping the 
high-school work. 
The most unsatisfactory part of the physics re- 
quirement (or supposed requirement) has been the 
laboratory work. I say, supposed requirement, for 
probably no one in any position to require has ever 
wished for such extremities of mathematical frivolities 
as many of the recent offshoots from the colleges 
have vainly tried to implant in high-school labora- 
tories. As usual the disciples in trying to imitate 
M
-P-A-G-E-178
  162 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
their masters have greatly exaggerated their foibles. 
Unconscious that what is bad for college students 
is worse for high-school pupils, they have seized 
upon what was either evil or without significance 
in their own college laboratory work and wrung 
interminable changes upon it for high-school pupils. 
The real laboratory requirements, however, as 
executed by the readers have been a great handicap 
to good teaching. The reader’s interpretation of 
what an orthodox laboratory notebook should be 
has never been authorized and never published. 
From the record of success and failures of their 
candidates the high-school teachers have inferred 
that the readers insisted upon the notebooks con- 
taining much of that which I should regard as 
not physics at all. The high-school teachers have 
likewise found that small credit would be given 
to that which this committee declares is the very 
aim of laboratory work, namely, ‘‘to supplement 
the pupil’s fund of concrete knowledge and to fur- 
nish forceful illustrations of fundamental principles 
and their practical applications. To perform exer- 
cises such as yield results capable of ready interpre- 
tation and free from the disguise of unintelligible 
units. ... Unnecessary mathematical difficulties 
being avoided and care being exercised to prevent 
the student’s losing sight of the concrete facts, in the 
multiplication of symbols.” 
Most of the unjust rating of candidates for admis- 
sion to college has been the result of the absurd 
attempt of human minds not widely trained to esti- 
mate the value of the laboratory work of a total
-P-A-G-E-179
  COLLEGE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 163 
stranger by glancing over in four minutes the notes 
which required a year in the writing. No demand 
has been more insistent than that this abuse be 
stopped. A majority of that committee of high- 
school men went into the meeting fully determined 
that it must be stopped. 
The first and most important reform which they 
have brought about is that the College Entrance 
Examination Board will no longer undertake the 
marking or examination of laboratory notebooks. 
The high-school teacher is to certificate the labora- 
tory work wholly according to his best judgment. 
It is no longer indicated to him by the syllabus 
what shall be the nature of the laboratory work. 
It will doubtless need to be that which will best 
help the pupils to pass the topical examinations, 
but I estimate that fully one-half of the time now 
given to laboratory work in many of the best schools 
does nothing toward helping the students to pass 
the examination questions and does nothing toward 
giving them a clearer understanding of physical 
principles. Since half of the time given to the study 
of physics in these schools is devoted to the laboratory 
the way is now open for them to save one-quarter 
of their efforts for work that is worth while. If the 
committee had done nothing else than to abolish 
the rating of laboratory notebooks by readers, we 
could easily have been satisfied for one year. For 
now there is no reason why a capable teacher may 
not make all of his laboratory teaching fruitful. 
Before, much of it had to be barren by specific re- 
quirement.
-P-A-G-E-180
  164 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
In the number of topics which appear in the sylla- 
bus the committee left a larger prescription than 
the high-school teacher can do well — but it probably 
did all the pruning that it was safe to do this time. 
The most efficient teachers are the ones who will 
see the largest possibilities in each topic for instruc- 
tion and will therefore feel the greatest burden. 
Many complaints from such persons are coming 
in, and now that the high-school teachers have their 
hand in they will doubtless bring about a reduc- 
tion in the number of topics when the syllabus is 
next revised. The committee probably had in 
mind that the field was too broad to cover thor- 
oughly when they made their second recommenda- 
tion, which reads as follows: 
«* We urge upon those who prepare the examination questions 
that these be so planned that students who have received fair 
preparation on the work as here outlined may reasonably be 
expected to pass.” 
This sounds very different from the boast which 
has been made that after casting out one-third of 
each class during the four years of the high-school 
course we serve the cause still further by knocking 
out half of those who try for admission to college. 
This committee of high-school men speaks with some 
of the missionary spirit appropriate to those who in 
the service of the people are trying to extend the 
benefits of education. 
It is not expected, I presume, that I should discuss 
with this audience the specific additions or omis- 
sions in the list of topics. You care not, I presume, 
whether f = ma is included or excluded. Yet I
-P-A-G-E-181
  COLLEGE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 165 
must tell you that a considerable amount of such 
pestiferous knowledge has been removed from the 
syllabus. 
Now a few words as to the future. I am speak- 
ing to an audience composed of principals of second- 
ary schools and of the teachers of all the various 
high-school subjects. We all have, however, a 
common cause, and it is upon our common problems 
that I wish to speak. The same thing is the matter 
with physics teaching as with all other subjects. 
I saw a young college graduate teaching a high- 
school class in English. She had detained them six 
weeks on the first third of Ivanhoe, using the method 
of the higher criticism. She informed me that it 
was the only way to get them ready for college. 
Which is true. It is also true that it was the only 
way she knew for teaching Ivanhoe, and for both of 
these the colleges are to blame, but, worse than all, 
when after attending educational meetings and 
reading educational literature and having a few 
years’ more contact with the high-school pupils 
she learns a better way of teaching Ivanhoe, she 
will be prevented by college requirements from using 
it, unless the high-school men reform the require- 
ments. 
I saw another college graduate teaching botany 
in a Western high school—a school accredited 
by the state university. They had for many weeks 
been examining plant cells with a compound micro- 
scope and filling many pages of notebooks with 
drawings of them. I asked if so much of this work 
were desirable. She said, “No, but the university 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
166 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
inspector requires it.” There was lying upon her 
desk a copy of Bailey’s Botany, full of useful knowl- 
edge such as those high-school pupils need. I asked | 
her if it would not be better to give them that. 
She said, “The university would not approve it.” 
It perhaps should be said in justice to the universities 
that such approval or disapproval generally comes 
from a minor officer — but so long as the universities 
allow their minor officers to act as their spokesmen 
they cannot escape the charge of being either igno- 
rant of or indifferent to the cause of secondary edu- 
cation. These are not peculiar cases. There is 
no subject which can be well taught in the high 
schools to-day for the simple reason that the colleges 
prevent it. 
The case of high-school physics to-day is analogous 
to a situation which obtained for Latin thirty years 
ago. It was the practice of some teachers then to 
spend two or three weeks previous to the teaching 
of Virgil in training pupils in the rules of the gram- 
mar which applied to scanning poetry. These rules 
with their exceptions numbered several score. 
They were learned, “and stored in memory so that 
pupils might have them to use when they came to 
the business of reading Virgil.” It often happened 
that Virgil was taught by another teacher and fre- 
quently this teacher made no mention of scanning, 
but of course if he did, he discovered no ability in 
the class to use those rules of grammar. This is 
precisely the case of high-school physics to-day. 
The high-school teacher feels obliged to teach what 
might be very well called the rules of physical gram- 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
   COLLEGE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 167 
mar. Some teachers know that language teaching 
must come before grammar, but the real powers 
that prescribe the work for all teachers, good and 
bad alike, have not yet got beyond the a-b, ab method 
of teaching. After compelling the high-school teach- 
ers to teach by an impossible method and one long 
since discredited in other subjects, these college 
people are surprised to find that the high-school 
pupils do not understand physics. 
This topical syllabus is a list of principles. A few 
teachers are urging that some practical applications 
be added, as if to say, “Some few sentences from 
good literature should be appended to interpret 
the rules of grammar,” but for every one teacher 
who dares to suggest this a dozen will respond, ‘‘ We 
have not time to teach applications, the list of 
principles is so long, and in any case we cannot teach 
applications before we teach principles.” And the 
readers of examination papers on their part say, 
“We cannot rate questions on applications. of 
principles; they are too indefinite; we must mark 
on the principles and particularly on the mathe- 
matical work, for that is definite.” The examiners 
have on several occasions attempted to encourage 
teachers to enrich their work in physics by asking 
some general question about, say, the heating of 
buildings. Such questions cause great perplexity 
to the readers, and they decide by conference what 
specific answer will be given full credit and allow 
nothing for any other. As, for example, if the 
candidate explains specific heat in answer to the 
above question, it will be rated correct ; but a para- 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  168 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
graph or a page of other replies, however intelli- 
gent, will be rejected without credit. 
The makers of the syllabus and of the examina- 
tion questions are still further moved to eliminate 
applications because applications in physics must 
of necessity vary with locality, occupation, sex of 
pupils, etc., and the whole business of standardizing 
physics and bringing about a glorious uniformity 
runs counter to this. 
The truth is that the so-called fundamental 
doctrines of physics are fundamental neither to the 
science of physics nor to the teaching of that science. 
Our doctrines in physics are no more fundamental 
than they are in religion. We change them oftener. 
Neither are these principles any more help to the 
teaching of physics than Calvinism is in the teach- 
ing of religion. 
I hope the high-school men, pushed on by the 
public which is behind them, will gradually change 
that list of principles in physics to a list of physical 
phenomena or rather experiences which one may 
encounter in life and of which the ordinary man 
desires an explanation. And I predict that when 
high-school pupils have been taught to notice the 
experiences of a physical sort which their lives 
present to them and to classify them so that one 
fact throws light on another, they will come to the 
college instruction with a gratifying ability to grasp 
physical principles. But it must be their own 
life experiences, found outside of the conventional 
laboratory — and not such as may be prescribed 
for them by some central body, whose only anxiety
-P-A-G-E-185
  COLLEGE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 169 
is to rate and make uniform the contents of pupils’ 
minds. 
Our besetting sin in physics teaching is something 
which goes under the euphonious name of thor- 
oughness. We have a block-measuring mania in 
some parts of the country. Pupils are required to 
measure the four edges representing the length of 
a block of wood to the tenth of a millimeter, which 
is y$z part of an inch. These are to be averaged 
and the result taken as the true length. In like 
manner, the four edges representing the width 
and the four representing the thickness are to be 
treated, and then these results are to be multiplied 
together and the volume recorded in terms which 
represent less than tost-ooo of a cubic inch. The 
pupils know that the exercise lacks common sense, 
since the measuring sticks are crude, the edges of 
the blocks are battered, the faces are not perfect 
planes, and the human eye is incapable of reading 
such microscopic dimensions. If such training 
has any effect, it would seem rather to disqualify 
them for making useful measurements like the 
length of the schoolroom or estimating its height. 
Consider the years spent in drill. The elementary- 
school teacher devotes a very large portion of time 
to drill upon mathematics. The high-school teacher 
thinks the grammar-school training is defective and 
he takes up the drill upon mathematics. The 
college teacher believes the high-school training is 
defective and he attempts the same drill. In this 
series of onslaughts upon the students the college 
teacher effects the least results and the elementary-  
-P-A-G-E-186
  170 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
school teacher’s work is the most efficient. In- 
vestigations show that drill in mathematics beyond 
a certain few years of it have no effect upon the 
pupils’ abilities. 
The percentage of high-school pupils studying 
mathematics increased during the fifteen years, 1890- 
1905, from 66 per cent to 88 per cent, and during the 
same time the percentage of those studying physics 
decreased from 22 per cent to 15 per cent and as 
though that were not bad enough we have tried to 
convert physics into mathematics, and we have been 
told that this was in the interests of thoroughness. 
I predict that school pupils will some time have 
the privilege which we, who have got beyond the 
domination of our schoolmasters, enjoy of learn- 
ing many things with the intention of forgetting 
them immediately — more than half of the subject 
of physics should be so treated. If we adults had 
to learn thoroughly and retain for somebody’s 
examination one-tenth of that which we find it both 
delightful and profitable to learn each day we should 
be miserable. 
These children know wherein we wrong them and 
the best of them are longing for the time when 
they may rise above us. Is there any reason 
why we should not be willing that the children 
should learn by the same method which we find 
profitable? We learn by the smattering method — 
first a passing introduction — a mere fleeting impres- 
sion — then time for the ideas to incubate, and after 
a while another meeting with these ideas from per- 
haps a different standpoint followed by casual
-P-A-G-E-187
  
COLLEGE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 171 
meetings at intervals. The method of the daily 
newspaper reader is producing clear thinkers. 
Another privilege which every person young and 
old rightly prizes is that of learning something about 
many things which we cannot understand and ought 
not to be examined upon. The requirements in 
physics should be cut down so that there may be 
time to thus enrich the work in physics by lectures 
and outside reading. We have preached against 
mere memoriter work until our preaching has taken 
some effect in high-school teaching but we continue 
to give examinations which no amount of general 
intelligence would enable one to pass. No faculty 
nor body of graduate students could pass the entrance 
examinations — only those can pass them who have 
recently crammed their memories with the con- 
ventional material which appears nowhere else than 
in examinations. We have heard that high schools 
are deteriorating because their pupils do not pass 
entrance examinations to college, West Point Mili- 
tary Academy, and the like. I undertake to say 
that the more rational our instruction becomes the 
less will our pupils be able to pass the examinations 
as now given. Perhaps it is a commendation of 
the high schools that the secretary of the College 
Entrance Examination Board notes in his last 
report that a larger number of candidates than usual 
failed to pass the examinations. 
An eminent authority says, ‘“‘Really educated 
people are just those who have forgotten more than 
others.” It is essential to good thinking that one 
should not retain in memory much unorganized and
-P-A-G-E-188

useless material. Ideas sometimes require a long 
period of incubation. Inner intellectual life of 
extraordinary wealth is often hidden because of 
lack of means of adequate verbal expression or per- 
haps lack of the special gift of passing written 
examinations. 
It might be well for this association to appoint 
a commission to investigate the returns now on file 
with the secretary of the College Entrance Exami- 
nation Board. It is idle for individual pupils 
or teachers to attempt the matter of appeal but it 
is the duty of the secondary schools to have a com- 
mission for this purpose. I believe there are just 
as good persons kept out of college as are admitted 
by these examinations. The high-school teachers 
know before the examinations who are qualified to 
enter college and they know what ones have injus- 
tice done them by the examinations. It is the duty 
of some one to defend the pupils and to defend the 
good name of the schools.

LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE! 
WHEN one says he has reached a certain conclusion 
from his experience, particularly if that experience 
has been prolonged and varied, he usually expects 
us to consider him an authority. Nothing, however, 
is more common than for one person to dispute the 
conclusions drawn from another’s experience and to 
appeal to his own experience for counter-evidence. 
One who has listened to farmers, mechanics, and all 
sorts of practical men, each attempting to disprove 
the conclusions of another by appealing to his own 
experience, is forced to think that in some cases 
experience serves little else than to entrench a person 
more firmly in error. Note how dubious the phy- 
sician looks when his patient claims to know from 
experience that certain things are good or bad for 
him. I take it, however, that most of those whom 
I am addressing would rather rely upon the evidence 
of the practical than the theoretical man. We take 
a good deal of satisfaction in the fact that Galileo 
settles by observation and experiment many ques- 
tions which had been mooted for two thousand years, 
after the fashion of the dialectics of Plato and Aris-

totle. And I suppose that most of us have a notion 
that we are teaching the future citizen the art of 
learning something reliable from his experience. 
We cannot hope that the few facts learned in school 
will suffice for life, and so we aim to prepare the 
student to gather facts from his experience through- 
out life, and we like to think that the difference 
between the schooled and the unschooled person is 
that the former will be able to give more reliable 
testimony from his experiences. This I find has 
been the aim of all books on science teaching which 
have been written in the last century and a half, 
and this is the professed aim of every one of us to- 
day —but what is our practice? During the 
third of a century, in which I have been engaged in 
teaching and observing the teaching of chemistry, 
there has been a constant increase in the attention 
given to chemical theory in high-school instruction 
—a greater and greater refinement of chemical defi- 
nitions and doctrine and a proportional decrease in 
the tendency to lead pupils to derive their knowledge 
from the experiences of life. The introduction of 
individual laboratory work on the part of the pupils 
has even accentuated this tendency rather than coun- 
teracted it. Laboratory experiments are performed 
with apparatus which suggests nothing found any- 
where outside the laboratory and for purposes which 
obtain nowhere else. Meanwhile, the refinements 
of chemical doctrine which are supposed to be 
fundamental remind one of the Church Catechism 
—and one of these codes has about as much re- 
lation to life’s problems as the other. A great
-P-A-G-E-191
  LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE 175 
American teacher, Professor J. P. Cooke, once said 
to a group of teachers, gathered at the Harvard 
Summer School : 
“Tt is not only useless but injurious in the education of 
young minds to present any department of physical science as 
a body of definitions, principles, laws, or theories. Such facts 
only should be taught as can be verified either by experience 
of the pupils or by the simplest experiments.” 
The commissioner of education in this state (Massa- 
chusetts) has said : 1 
“All education seems to inherit a fundamental tendency 
toward the abstract, the relatively unreal, the bookish. The 
teaching of science has done something to correct this, but even 
here there seems to be a persistent disposition to wander out of 
the sunlight.” 
There is a rather strenuous attempt in some quar- 
ters to teach what is called applications in chemistry. 
I note how this association and the New: York 
Chemistry Teachers’ Club and other such organi- 
zations of chemistry teachers devote most of their 
meetings to excursions to chemical factories and the 
like, presumably in search of applications of chemical 
principles with which to enrich their teachings. I 
think, however, that many teachers have gone only 
so far as to use these applications to give concrete- 
ness to their teaching of principles — somewhat as 
a dictionary defines words and quotes phrases to 
show their application. Some teachers think that 
school and college are the places to teach funda- 
mental principles only, leaving the applications to 
1 Educational Review, Vol. 39, p. 13. 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  176 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
be found by the pupil, if he nibs in after-life. 
And some scorn practical applications as savoring of 
vocation or trade. But those who test students in 
after-life know that the graduates from such instruc- 
tion carry with them little understanding of either 
applications or principles. Some few teachers take 
the stand that the applications must be taught 
from the first for the sake of making the principles 
understandable, but with all of these classes the end 
in view is “grounding the student in chemical 
doctrine.” Now I contend that a knowledge of 
chemical theory is of secondary importance to the 
vast majority of high-school pupils, but that a 
scientific study of their daily experiences is of the 
greatest importance to all students. I might fur- 
ther claim that if one is seeking a knowledge of 
chemical theory he will reach that end most surely 
by inverting the usual order of procedure. I hear 
some one saying, ““You cannot teach application 
until you have first taught principles,” and I reply, 
“You cannot teach principles until after you have 
taught applications — very many applications.” 
The high-school course might well be little else than 
application with a very incidental reference to 
principles. It should be a sort of organization of 
experiences, letting one throw light upon another 
according to Huxley’s idea that science is merely 
organized common sense. Twenty years ago I 
wrote a book on this plan, but I had at that time 
an exaggerated idea of the availability of the in- 
ductive method for the instruction of the young. 
I now believe in giving large doses of information. 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE 177 
We need not, I think, fear the “talking teacher.” 
All great teachers have been conspicuous for that 
gift, and it is noticeable that they all have bristled 
with information which they had a passion for 
imparting to others. Their pupils learned to think 
in orderly fashion apparently by imitating their 
teacher. It is a powerful incentive to scientific 
thinking to have a master, whom you fully trust, 
lead you through the interpretation of your own 
experiences. Our experiences and our observations 
upon nature are not naturally differentiated under 
such headings as chemistry, physics, physiology, 
botany, etc. If we label them anything we may 
use the term general science. It is science if it is 
organized common sense. By a strange inversion of 
ideas the college preparatory course in chemical 
doctrine has been called science. It seems*to me 
to bear a similar relation to science that gram- 
mar does to literature and modern students go 
far in literature before touching grammar and they 
never study grammar much. 
Let me illustrate my meaning by outlining some 
topics of instruction. 
In front of a certain building there is an iron fence, 
very rusty, showing that some chemical action has 
been going on. There is another near by which has 
been carefully attended to, scraped, and painted, 
in order that this chemical action should not go on. 
We are at great pains, most of us, to see that this 
action does not take place with our iron things. 
Many of our iron goods are covered with tin, zinc, 
or nickel to prevent this action. We cover them with 
N
-P-A-G-E-194
  178 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
vaseline. We oil them. We use agate iron, or 
enameled iron. Concrete covers iron in our modern 
buildings. It is so hard to protect iron from this 
destruction that we do not expect to find pure iron 
in nature. If we want a pure.specimen in a museum, 
we keep it free from the action of the air and free 
from contact with moisture. We have noticed that 
when iron is brought out of the blacksmith’s furnace 
it has undergone this action much more abundantly ; 
it is coated thickly with this rust. We have noticed 
in our experience that it will not do to let water 
stand in tin basins; we find a yellow spot where the 
water has begun to attack the iron through the tin. 
A hardware storekeeper will bring out his best 
cutlery, carefully protected from this chemical 
action, probably wrapped in something that will 
keep it dry and protect it from the action of the 
air. Nails which are left exposed to the weather 
go through this process, and they grow larger, a 
crust forms upon them, and they actually increase 
in weight. 
I do not suppose that anybody will imagine that 
I condemn the teaching of chemical theory in its 
proper place. I am not urging that you follow the 
pace of the pupil, or even his interests. However, 
your students should draw from you the explanation 
and theory rather than for you to be forcing it upon 
them in the wrong place. I am contending that you 
do now put the chemical theory in the wrong place 
and furnish too much of it. Your pupils will want to 
know the explanation of this action, and you should 
tell the story of the modern idea of oxidation in a
-P-A-G-E-195
  
LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE 179 
very brief and incidental way, and it should come 
up in many different connections if you would have 
it well understood. 
Tron is not the only metal that corrodes. We 
have no end of trouble to keep our silver and brass 
from tarnishing. We protect them by covering 
with some metal which is less likely to tarnish. Your 
students will ask, why do silver spoons tarnish so 
rapidly in hard-cooked eggs? Why does a dime 
that is kept in a pocket with a rubber eraser tarnish ? 
Metals do tarnish; what are they given to uniting 
with? Look through a mineral cabinet and see 
what sort of compounds of the metal there are. 
Heat seems to aid in this action, and heat carried 
to a much higher degree arrests the action. And so 
we can easily imagine the conditions of things out- 
side of our experience. What about the conditions 
in the atmosphere of the sun? We know some- 
thing about the chemistry of the sun, almost as 
much as about the chemistry of our own surround- 
ings. We have thus far noticed two influences which 
induce chemical change — heat and moisture. See 
how we make use of the first influence in the labora- 
tory; nearly all our work depends upon the use of 
the Bunsen burner. There are very few experiments 
that do not require heat of some sort to produce the 
change desired. We cannot observe cooking pro- 
cesses very much without noticing that time as 
well as temperature is an important consideration. 
Why are we so interested in the fireless cooker? 
Largely because it brings in the question of time. 
I remember how, when I first became a teacher,
-P-A-G-E-196
180 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
I tried to bring out from the experiences of the 
country boy a series of lessons. We were burning 
a piece of paper and dropped it on the stove. It 
changed to a black substance,/and a few drops of 
a thick liquid remained on the stove, smearing it. 
And I tried to make it clear by giving a multitude 
of other experiences. I will give you just an outline 
of this. I had been burning some waste paper in 
the furnace. When I opened the door of the fur- 
nace, drops of a thick liquid fell down from the 
inside of the door upon the paved cellar bottom. 
In that town I went to a country church which 
was heated by a stove, with a long pipe running the 
whole length of the building to a chimney. There 
were places where the stovepipe gapped, and 
oftentimes you could see drops of this liquid come 
out. Of course it was generally thought that it 
was water from outside that had come down the 
chimney. And then there was the smokehouse, 
where the same thing was going on over and over 
again, smearing the walls of the smokehouse. And 
then there were the chimney fires. Why should a 
» pile of brick get on fire once in a while? I found 
that the inside walls were smeared with a liquid, 
and other things that came from the destructive 
distillation of what was being burned in the stove. 
Then there was the gas factory; because those were 
the days when they were throwing away the waste 
products. And when the long and interesting story 
of the coal-tar products came out they created tre- 
mendous interest in my class in chemistry. And 
then there was the candle, and that most interesting 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE 181 
book, The Chemical History of a Candle, written 
by Faraday. He said in his introduction that in 
sitting down to watch that candle he saw every law 
of the physical universe illustrated. And then came 
the wonderful series of petroleum products. 
Now heat breaks down chemical compounds, and 
it stimulates chemical action most interestingly in 
the springtime. What goes on in nature in the 
spring months? Why, there are two things: the 
rise in temperature and the increase in moisture. 
Where we have the two things together we get 
the tropical heat of summer, and we are not able to 
get along without using ice, because nature gives 
us the conditions which stir up all sorts of chemical 
change. 
But there is something else that comes from our 
observation regarding this; it is the reverse that 
chemical action is all the time tending to raise the 
temperature. I engaged a man to bring me some 
manure, which I intended to use on the lawn. It 
was dumped down in a heap and left there for a few 
days. One day when I was out walking with my 
son, we passed the pile of manure. He stopped 
me and remarked that the pile was steaming as 
though there was a fire in it. Well, of course, I 
had to give him a lesson in chemistry, though he 
was only eight years old. But he was just as ready 
to hear that then as he will be in the third year of 
high school. Later in the season, we mowed the 
lawn, and raked the grass into a pile, and then we 
were negligent about removing it. My son, while 
playing on the lawn, put his foot into the pile of
-P-A-G-E-198
  182 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
hay. It was very hot; the chemical action that 
was going on produced heat. 
All along the street the plasterers are adding cold 
water to cold lime, making a mortar, and the whole 
gets steaming hot, and it is just sickening to see 
school children going by without seeing it. The 
trouble is they are tired of being snubbed for trying 
to learn from their experiences. What are all these 
regulations about disposing of painters’ rags, etc. ? 
They will produce heat and spontaneous combustion 
it is feared. To avoid such fires we are told that we 
must guard against heat and moisture. 
But this thing is going on in our own bodies. 
Animal heat is simply due to chemical changes like 
the heat in the grass pile, and we succeed in keeping 
a very interesting balance between the cold of 
winter and the intense heat of summer. We go into 
a cold room and creep into so-called “warm” 
blankets, although they are not any warmer than 
the room itself. We simply make the blankets 
warm by the heat of the body. Vegetable life 
goes through the same process. We have, therefore, 
a tremendously interesting chemical action going on 
in all sorts of plant organisms. So we are not 
surprised to find the sign, “Keep in a cool, dry 
place,” upon packages of various things. 
Then there is another thing that comes to a pupil 
from his experiences. That is that light is also an 
agent in the bringing about of chemical changes; as, 
for instance, in photography. I took up photography 
before there was any such thing as the dry plate, or 
the kodak films, or instantaneous exposure. I re-
-P-A-G-E-199
  LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE 183 
member how I would go out three hours after sunrise 
and make an exposure for a certain length of time, 
to get a picture, and then go out in the afternoon 
three hours before sunset, and it would be necessary 
to expose the film about three times as long as before 
in order to get the same result, when no one could 
discover by any observation of the eye that the 
day was less bright. This set a whole train of 
thoughts going; and it was not long after this that 
I heard of the wonderful flowers in Norway, and the 
short season for growing wheat in Siberia, which is 
explained by the fact that the very intense light is 
able to make up for the short season of high tem- 
perature. Then there were the sprouts growing 
upon potatoes in the cellar, and when you get them 
out in the sun they become green, because the chloro- 
phyll in the plant is developed by the sun. Then 
there was the strange action upon our skins in the 
summer time that makes the skin tan; and the fading 
of fabrics which we exposed to the light, and of the wall 
paper except where pictures have hung. I recollect 
one summer we hung some pictures on the bare walls 
of a camp. Next summer we wanted to change the 
decorations and so took down the pictures. The 
spots showed very clearly where the raw spruce 
boards had not been exposed to the light, while 
the rest had grown very yellow. I remember a 
‘blue serge suit. After a few weeks’ wear I had occa- 
sion to turn up the collar of the coat, and there was 
the original color under the collar, while the rest 
of the coat was entirely different. When my 
sister took down her hair, it showed the places
-P-A-G-E-200
  184 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
where it had faded because of the action of the 
light upon it. 
It is my belief that there is little in the whole 
field of science which you can teach to these young 
pupils except through the channels of their ex- 
periences.

  XI 
PRACTICAL CHEMISTRY! 
THERE are about 1000 teachers of chemistry in the 
secondary schools of this state (New York), but 
probably less than 50 of these are teachers of 
chemistry exclusively. 
For purposes of investigation we have divided the 
high schools of the state into three classes : 
Class 1.—Schools having teachers of physical 
science, biology, earth science, etc. (Departments 
which are represented by the various sections A, 
B, C, of this Association.) 
Class 2. — Schools having teachers of science. 
Class 3. — Schools having (just) teachers. 
Class 1 includes 7 per cent of the high schools of 
this state. 
Class 2 includes 10 per cent of the high schools of 
this state. 
Class 3 includes 83 per cent of the high schools of 
this state. 
This association was formed in 1895 by certain 
members of Class 1 and has been sustained during 
these 17 years by members of that class. More 
1Read before the New York State Science Teachers’ Association 
at Syracuse, December 27, 1912. 
185  
-P-A-G-E-202
  186 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
than one-third of the members of Class 1 are in 
New York City. Those persons formed 15 years 
ago local associations such as The New York Physics 
Teachers’ Club, The New York Chemistry Teachers’ 
Club, The New York Biology Teachers’ Club, etc. 
. There are several other centers in the state where 
the same thing has happened. These study local 
problems and local industries for the purpose of 
making the instruction in the schools more practical. 
A good many of the schools which belong to Class 1 
throughout the state have for one reason or another 
never been represented in this association. It there- 
fore happens that this association with the all-in- 
clusive name of “The New York State Science 
Teachers’ Association” represents only two or 
three per cent of the schools of the state. 
Our aim has been to find out how instruction in 
chemistry in the schools throughout the state might 
be made more practical — more vitally connected 
with life — more of an interpretation of the experi- 
ences of the pupils. We find that during the last 
17 years the tendency has been to make high-school 
chemistry a very complex system of doctrine with 
little attempt to give it local application. 
Class 1 above referred to, working under the im- 
mediate influence of the colleges, has been largely 
responsible for the present prescription in high- 
school chemistry for New York State. 
The members of Classes 2 and 3, although con- 
stituting more than nine-tenths of the schools of 
the state, have had practically no voice in the 
matter of this prescription. Perhaps a majority of
-P-A-G-E-203
  PRACTICAL CHEMISTRY 187 
the teachers of chemistry in the state are principals 
of schools. They do not, as a rule, attend the meet- 
ings of this association. Their own association has 
met annually in Syracuse at this season for 28 years. 
The most obvious distinction which one might 
make between Class 1 on the one hand and Classes 
2 and 3 on the other is that a large number of the 
members of Class 1 are fresh from college and teach 
what they have been taught in the way they were 
taught it. They specialized in chemistry in col- 
lege. They specialize in chemistry in high-school 
instruction. Their knowledge of other subjects is 
exiguous. Their experiences in life are too limited 
for them to meet high-school pupils upon their own 
ground. They are said to teach chemistry rather 
than pupils. In Classes 2 and 3 there appear to be 
a larger proportion of persons who understand their 
pupils and who know how to make chemistry mean 
something to them. Such have in many cases 
risen to principalships because of their wider knowl- 
edge of human nature. They are, in short, bigger 
men and women than specialists can be. They live 
in the smaller cities and towns and have fewer 
pupils to deal with. They have more direct con- 
tact with nature, with their pupils, and with their 
pupils’ homes. They are the persons who are 
making chemistry or any other subject which they 
may teach vital. 
Our statistics show that members of Class 1 dwell 
on the average in cities of 112,000 inhabitants and 
teach in high schools of 1200 pupils, having 37 teach- 
ers to the school, each confining his attention to 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  188 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
one subject. Members of Class 2 dwell on the aver- 
age in cities of 15,000 inhabitants and teach in high 
schools of 165 pupils with 7 teachers to the school, 
each giving instruction in a group of allied subjects. 
Members of Class 3 dwell on the average in towns 
of 6360 inhabitants and teach in schools of 70 
pupils with 4 teachers to the school, each teaching 
pupils in groups of half a dozen with that personal 
contact which is the chief factor in all good in- 
struction. 
I have visited many schools. In a typical case of 
the 3d class I found a town of 5000, a high school 
of 60 pupils and 3 teachers. The chemistry was 
taught by the principal. He is a leader in the life 
of that community. He has a house, a garden, and 
a family. There is plenty of chemistry in his life. 
It gets into the school and enriches the lives of the 
pupils. I turn from this to a case in the Ist class, 
of whom there are some — a city of 100,000 inhab- 
itants, a high school of 1000 pupils and 35 teachers. 
An instructor who conceived the idea while in 
college that chemistry was his forte. He says he 
majored in chemistry. Under the guidance of his 
college adviser he took everything possible in 
chemistry and as little as possible in other subjects. 
The longer he stayed in college the fewer things he 
knew. He is now instructor in chemistry to 35 pu- 
pils in a school of 1000. He has no garden to till. 
He lives in a hall bedroom and the students believe 
that contact with him is belittling. 
1. The statistics presented above raise the question 
whether after all general science, now being so widely
-P-A-G-E-205
  
PRACTICAL CHEMISTRY 189 
introduced throughout the country, is not ‘more 
practical than chemistry and physics. 
2. The discussions now going on all over the 
country raise the question whether boys and girls 
must be segregated in order that the teaching of 
chemistry may be practical. 
The United States Commissioner’s Report gives 
only 6 high schools in New York State for boys alone 
and only 8 for girls alone, while there are 866 for both 
sexes. In the whole United States there are only 35 
for boys alone and 27 for girls alone but 12,151 for 
coeducation. Nine-tenths of the high schools are 
too small to make segregation possible and in the 
large ones the complexity of the program with all 
its electives makes it rarely possible to separate boys 
and girls in classes. Girls are present in all our 
classes and they predominate. They constitute 
55 per cent of all our high-school pupils. Who thinks 
that the man who holds down a chair in some business 
office has more contact with problems of physical 
science than his wife with all her modern household 
appliances? Perhaps this talk about segregation is 
an academic discussion. 
8. The question of men teachers vs. women 
teachers for chemistry or physics. 
Women constitute 62 per cent of all high-school 
teachers. We desire to find out whether they are in 
the majority as chemistry teachers, and whether they 
are considered quite as satisfactory as men in such 
positions. The average salary for a high-school 
teacher in this state is now $1100. It was $665 
seventeen years ago when this association was born. 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  190 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
4. Should science be made practical in the same 
way that English has been of late years in the 
schools ? 
Some of us can remember when English was 
the weakest subject in the schools. Here are some 
statistics to show that it is now the strongest. I 
found that in one school library during a period of 
two months 993 readers appeared in pursuit of their 
work in English; 722 came for information in his- 
tory, but only 40 read because of their interest in 
science. There were in the library 3915 volumes, but 
only 71 of these pertained to physical science and 
two-thirds of these were the numerous text-books 
contributed by publishers. 
5. Here is a group of statistics which raise the 
question whether teachers are practical. 
In New York State 48 per cent of high-school 
pupils are in the first-year class. We manage to elimi- 
nate more than one-third of these so that 26 per cent 
appear in the second-year class. More thanone-third 
of these disappear, so that 16 per cent are found 
in the third-year class. More than one-third of 
these fail to reach their senior year and 10 per cent 
are found in the fourth-year class. A quarter of 
these are not allowed to graduate, and 8 per cent 
is the number of those who succeed. Half of these 
(four per cent) through “toil and trouble and tears” 
have prepared for college, and the colleges think 
they are doing the Lord’s service by rejecting half 
of these so that 2 per cent enter. There are plenty 
of people who raise the question whether these are 
superior or inferior to those who have dropped out
-P-A-G-E-207
  PRACTICAL CHEMISTRY 191 
by the way. These figures tabulated present the 
following appearance : 
Of high-school pupils in New York State there are 
48 per cent in Ist-year class, 26 per cent in 2d-year 
class, 16 per cent in 3d-year class, 10 per cent in 
4th-year class, 8 per cent graduate, 4 per cent pre- 
pared for college, 2 per cent admitted. These 
statistics do not differ materially from those shown 
by the United States Commissioner’s Report for the 
high schools of the whole country. 
If we were attempting to manage any other busi- 
ness with such a record as the above, the question

GENERAL SCIENCE 
In 1912 the National Education Association 
appointed a Committee on General Science. As 
chairman of this committee I sent out the following 
circular : 
All persons interested are invited to codperate 
with this committee in finding out what is good 
material to present and what are good methods to 
use. 
It has been suggested that we gather lists of ques- 
tions which young persons ask of parents and teach- 
ers in search for information in the field of science 
such as: What is the sun? How does it keep hot ? 
Why does it sometimes turn red? What gives 
the clouds so many different colors? What makes 
the street car run? How can animals breathe when 
under water? Why do leaves of plants turn red 
in autumn, etc. ? 
A lawyer testifies that in his profession he has found 
of great value the general science course which he took 
a generation ago consisting of the Geological Story 
Briefly Told and the stories of half a dozen other 
sciences briefly told. Many intelligent men have 
testified that what they need particularly is general 
information in the field of science. It has been 
192
-P-A-G-E-209
  GENERAL SCIENCE 193 
suggested that teachers, parents, and grown-up 
persons in general send to the Committee lists of 
facts in science which they by years of experience 
have found worth while to know. 
It has been suggested that lists be prepared of 
the incredible things persons say and do which show 
the need for instruction in general science and show 
what instruction is most needed. 
Suggestions for organizing common sense, develop- 
ing gumption, etc., are in order. Lists of problems 
are suggested in the field of natural science which 
require diagnosis at the hands of the ordinary 
person. In this age of machinery, life is becoming 
increasingly embarrassing to those who regard all 
mechanisms as uncanny. That education which 
its devotees are pleased to call the humanities, but 
which seems to leave its disciples incapable of serv- 
ing humanity, is becoming daily more inadequate. 
Lists of aims for this work are desired as also lists 
of sources of information. Lists of fundamental 
principles have been suggested. It has been sug- 
gested that no syllabus be prepared of work expected 
of all schools alike, but rather let it be urged that 
each teacher should adapt his work to local condi- 
tions. It has been suggested that any good work 
must be considered good preparation for the follow- 
ing years of high school and college. Facts which 
will be needed in the future years of any course at 
school are best taught when they are needed and 
when they are to be organized for some purpose. 
It is suggested that sample lessons be published 
in detail to guide inexperienced teachers in the best

method of presenting topics in general science. 
Several courses in general science have been already 
published indicating the progress in this matter 
up to the present time. 
All who are interested in this matter are invited 
to make further suggestions, to criticize those al- 
ready made, and especially to make some construc- 
tive contributions which will in each case be cred- 
ited to their authors in the published reports of the 
Committee. 
The returns which came in indicated that the 
schools should give information from the whole 
field of science — not neglecting astronomy. The 
public needs unmistakably require a new organiza- 
tion of science instruction according to projects. 
The problems of life are not differentiated after 
the manner of specialized science. Pupils in both 
elementary and high schools are in a much more 
primitive state of mind in regard to all science than 
our school programs would indicate. Many are 
apparently blind and deaf to nature’s most evident 
teachings. They are in the depths of superstition 
about common things even while surcharged with 
academic formulas regarding things scientific. Our 
secondary schools persist in articulating with that 
which is above them rather than with the elementary 
school. Few persons appear to know that they 
have the answers to most of their questions readily 
accessible in dictionaries, encyclopedias, and read- 
able books. Apparently we have deprecated the 
teaching of science from books too long and too
-P-A-G-E-211

successfully. The greatest need, and likewise the 
greatest demand, among even highly educated per- 
sons, is for information rather than training in science. 
All workers and students require training in their 
specialty, but in other fields they want knowledge 
in simple form and by the most direct method. 
Natural science has moved from a position of 
great worth as a school subject to one of minor 
importance. Science teachers everywhere are begin- 
ning to regard it a high duty to bring it back to its 
rightful place and value. Attention has been too 
sharply focused on teaching “subjects” as against 
teaching students those things that are important 
for them to know. The schools reached the low- 
est point in real science instruction when, under 
the stress of preparing for higher institutions, they 
narrowed their work to “the forty quantitative 
experiments.” It was desultory, scrappy, unor- 
ganized, unscientific. At best the teaching was 
confined to vocabularies of technical words, defini- 
tions of scientific terms, statements of “fundamental 
principles,” etc. The natural and effective order 
is not principles followed by applications, but the 
reverse. From a multitude of experiences, facts, 
and observations, arranged so as to illuminate one 
another, some few principles may be derived, if 
these principles can be shown to be fundamental 
and can be brought into immediate use. The trouble 
with most of the so-called “fundamental principles” 
is that they are never again met either in school 
or life, and the majority even of enlightened men 
get on very well without having ever heard of them, 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  196 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
or, having heard, they have forgotten them because 
they did not prove to be fundamental to anything. 
A principle which occurs, or is likely to occur, so 
often that one cannot forget it, is fundamental and 
few others need be considered. Principles are not 
to be taught merely for discipline and training, nor 
for use only in a remote future. 
The study of ‘“‘projects” in science will necessitate 
the breaking down of boundary fences that have 
been erected between highly specialized sciences. 
General science should be adapted to local condi- 
tions and may not be universalized. Many proj- 
ects elaborated by ingenious and skilled teachers 
should be published in a series of small books or 
pamphlets for the use of pupils. Teachers may 
select from these as time, place, and other circum- 
stances require. Enough of this material may easily 
be prepared to occupy many years of study on the 
part of pupils. What is worth while to know from 
the fields of astronomy, botany, chemistry, geology, 
meteorology, physics, physiology, zodlogy, etc., 
may be thus acquired.

SCIENCE TEACHING BY PROJECTS! 
THERE are those who say that nothing worthy 
to be called science may be taught before the last 
three years of the high-school course — the Senior 
High School. They say that real, serious science 
is to be found chiefly in the college, and that what 
is permissible in the senior high school is the learn- 
ing of “fundamental principles’ preparatory to 
college science. There are, however, others who 
say that children from 12 to 15 years of age come 
nearest of all persons to using the method of the 
great masters’ of science, and practice the most 
real research. 
“The native and unspoiled attitude of childhood, marked by 
ardent curiosity, fertile imagination, and love of experimental 
inquiry, is near, very near, to the attitude of the scientific 
mind.” ? 
Bacon said: 
“‘We must become as little children in order to enter the 
kingdom of science.” 
“At present, the notion is current that childhood is almost 
entirely unreflective—a period of mere sensory, motor, and

memory development, while adolescence suddenly brings the 
manifestation of thought and reason. .... But thinking itself 
remains just what it has been all the time. . . . Only by mak- 
ing the most of the thought-factor, already active in the ex- 
perience of childhood, is there any promise or warrant for the 
emergence of superior reflective power of adolescence or at any 
later period.” ! 
Elsewhere Dewey says: 
‘* Tt isnot our function to teach children to think — they think 
quite as much as we do. It may be our privilege to guide their 
thinking.” 
We are told that the high-school-college-prepara- 
tory course in physics, for instance, with its 200 
odd topics, is serious science, that it is highly special- 
ized and that: it is preparatory to still more serious 
science hereafter. My opinion is that it is a dis- 
jointed skeleton of falsely called “fundamental 
principles”; that it is not science and does not 
prepare for science; that it is not specialized at 
all but is a hodgepodge of stuff never met by intelli- 
gent people in real life. 
Dr. Coulter in his address on what the university 
expects of the secondary schools said : 
“The average college preparation presents to the university 
the most narrow and unevenly trained material that can be 
imagined.” ? 
And those who deal with graduate students say the 
same thing about the college work. 
Since the defects in high-school teaching are due 
chiefly to the fact that high-school teachers are

college products and are close imitators of college 
methods we must first deal with the colleges. 
“An ever-present question in an institution of the higher 
learning is how to interest officers of instruction in the subject 
of education. They are certain to be interested, each in his own 
particular branch of study, but too few of them are interested 
in education itself. The consequence is that the teaching of 
many very famous men is distinctly poor; sometimes it is even 
worse. This results in part from the breakdown of the general 
educational process into a variety of highly specialized activities, 
and in part from the carelessness of college teachers as to every- 
thing which affects a student’s manners, speech, conduct, and 
sense of proportion, provided only he gets hold of certain facts 
which the teacher desires to communicate. 
“One mistake into which college teachers are most likely to 
fall is that of confusing the logical with the psychological order 
in the presentation of facts. The really good teacher knows that 
the logical order is the result of mature reflection and close an- 
alysis of a large body of related phenomena, and he knows too 
that this comes late in the history of intellectual development. 
He knows also that the psychological order — the true order for 
the teacher to follow — is the one which is fixed by the intrinsic 
interest and practical significance of the phenomena in question. 
The good teacher will not try to force the logical order of facts 
or phenomena upon the immature student. He will present 
these facts or phenomena to him in their psychological order 
and so give him the material with which to understand, when- 
his knowledge is sufficiently complete, the logical order and all 
that it means... . 
“Tt should be possible for an advanced student specializing 
in some other field to gain a general knowledge of physical 
problems and processes without becoming a physicist; or a 
general knowledge of chemical problems and processes without 
becoming a chemist; or a general knowledge of zodlogical 
problems and processes without becoming a zodlogist; or a 
general knowledge of mathematical problems and processes 
without becoming a mathematician. The reply that knowledge  
-P-A-G-E-216
  200 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
has become so highly specialized that no one can be found to 
give such courses of instruction is the saddest confession of in- 
competence and educational failure that can possibly be made. 
It ought not to be made except under cover of darkness.” ! 
The process of learning in school should not differ 
from that out of school. 
“Adults have some occupation about which their thinking 
is organized. Information is not amassed and left in a heap. 
Inferences are made not from purely speculative motives but 
because they bear upon some of life’s problems.’ 2 
Dr. McMurry states the case convincingly as fol- 
lows: 
“Should the student be a collector of facts at large, endeavor- 
ing to develop an interest in whatever is true, simply because 
it is true? Should he be unmindful of particular problems? 
or should his study be under the’ guidance of a specific purpose?” 
“Much has been said in times past about art for art’s sake, 
science for the sake of science, and knowledge for the sake of 
knowledge, but these are vague expressions that will excite little 
interest so long as the worth of a man is determined by what 
comes out of him, by the service he renders, rather than by what 
enters in.” ? 
“There is nothing less profitable than scholarship for the mere 
sake of scholarship, nor anything more wearisome in the attain- 
ment. But the moment you have a definite aim, attention is 
quickened, the mother of memory, and all that you acquire 
groups and arranges itself in an order that is lucid, because every- 
where and always it is in intelligent relation to a central object 
of constant and growing interest.” 4 
“Tf students regularly occupy a portion of their study time in 
thinking out live questions that they hope to have answered by

versity.

their further study, and interesting uses that they intend to make 
of their knowledge, they are equipping themselves with active 
power both for study and for the broader work of life.” ! 
“Indeed the reason why self-trained men so often surpass men 
who are trained by others in the effectiveness and success of 
their reading, is that they know what they read and study, and 
have definite aims and wishes in all their dealings with books.” ? 
Some are accusing General Science of lacking 
organization of subject matter. But when rightly 
understood it will be found that the whole movement 
is an attempt to introduce first of all a very specific 
organization where none now exists, and secondly 
a very different kind of organization from that 
hitherto attempted. This lack of organization which 
makes the school below a sort of dumping ground 
for the school above is one of our grievances. If the 
teacher above wants to use the slide rule, the teacher 
below must teach it. If he wants to use the metric 
system, the teacher below must teach that. If the 
college professor wants to measure gas as no one 
else on earth does it, the high-school teacher must 
teach that process even though it crowds out a 
thousand more important matters judged from the 
standpoint of the pupils’ needs. These pupils are 
going to buy and sell gas all their lives. But any- 
thing done in school to teach them to do that in- 
telligently is decried by some as savoring of the 
practical. 
Very little of this knowledge which the high- 
school pupils spend so much time to acquire, is

possessed by any intelligent group of persons. But 
for the high-school pupils it ranks as “‘fundamental 
principles” preparatory to “serious science.” 
“The greatest problem that the schools are facing is the lack 
of intimate relationship between the work of the schools and the 
work of the world. School work needs to be real instead of 
artificial. When pupils are learning something real that has an 
object behind and a result to come, they are energetic, when they 
listen to or watch or read something that is to them artificial, 
they are apathetic. In all of these characteristics the children in 
our schools closely resemble us adults.” 
“The most serious defect of the present course of study, is 
that it makes thousands of children waste tens of thousands of 
precious hours in the laborious acquisition of facts for which 
they will never have any practical use. The material which the 
children in the schools are daily learning is of a sort that is 
seldom or never met with in the business of even the most suc- 
cessful men engaged in commercial and professional pursuits.” 1 
Eleven prominent men of Springfield, Ill.—a

better with the so-called fundamental principles of 
high-school science ? 
The movement for general science is first of all 
a protest against the present régime of unorganized 
subject matter. We propose general science as an 
antidote for that which now is too general to be 
called science, either serious or flippant. The move- 
ment for general science is, in the second place, an 
attempt, for purposes of instruction, to introduce 
a “psychological organization,” as Dr. Dewey puts 
it;! or a “genetic organization,” as President Hall 
states the case: 
“The chief among many reasons why all branches of science 
are so disappointing to their promoters in high school and college 
is, that in the exact logical, technical way they are taught, they 
violate the basal law of psychic growth, ignore the deep springs of 
natural interest and attempt to force a precocity against which 
the instincts of the young, so much wiser and truer and older 
than their consciousness, happily revolt.” 2 
Organization of subject matter must be made 
around the knowledge of the pupil, not around that 
of the teacher or syllabus maker. We have to build 
on the instincts and experiences of the individual, 
otherwise we ‘are hanging our building on a hypo- 
thetical foundation in mid-air. 
The real way to learn fundamental principles is 
to attack those problems of which life is full for 
each individual, not through the preparatory fallacy 
called the scientific method, but by a “forked road 
situation.” The school should prepare pupils to 
1See, How We Think, Chapter V.

-P-A-G-E-220
    204 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
walk alone by attacking real problems as Archi- 
medes, Galileo, Davy, Faraday, Pasteur, Tyndall, 
and all the rest did. Most of us know, if we would 
think back over our experiences, that we never 
really learn these so-called fundamental principles 
until they come to us as an interpretation of some 
of our life’s problems. Our teaching bears so little 
fruit because we are attempting what in the nature 
of the case can never succeed. We know that we 
are not learning things that way now, never have 
learned things that way, never can. We prescribe 
that sort of “serious science” for the defenseless, 
and when their unerring instincts revolt, we accuse 
them of being unwilling to be serious, unwilling to 
work, even while they are pleading to be rid of us 
that they may get to work. It is not merely the 
geniuses like Newton, Maxwell, Kelvin, and all the 
rest who thank the Lord when they get out from 
under their teachers, but this is likewise true of 
many of the pupils of to-day, some of whom instinc- 
tively know what science is, and are pursuing it 
in spite of us and outside of our tuition. 
Imagine one of us in the following situation: we 
build a dam across a stream of water, and the pond 
that thus results surrounds some trees which we 
value. In our ignorance we may think the trees 
will fare better now than before, having an abundance 
of water and food brought to them by the river. 
But soon they die, and we go to the botanist, for 
light on this subject, and he undertakes to prescribe 
to us, as he does to his pupils, something like this: 
“You must take a series of preparatory courses in
-P-A-G-E-221
SCIENCE TEACHING BY PROJECTS 205 
botany before I can help you with your problem. 
Here is a First Course in Botany for children which 
I prescribe.” It has 158 pages, the first thirty-six 
of which classify leaves as net veined, parallel 
veined, feather veined, palmate veined, entire, 
serrate, crenate, dentate, repand, hastate, sagittate, 
lanceolate, cordate, ovate, reniform, orbicular, ro- 
tundate, acicular, deltoid, spatulate, peltate, run- 
cinate, pedate, lyrate, pinnate, digitate, cirrus, 
adnate, ochreate, sessile, ete., for thirty-six pages. 
You are advised to have the leaves present to make 
the study concrete. This is classified knowledge, and 
hence science, serious science, preparatory serious 
science. As a supplementary exercise one might 
classify all the nails in the school yard fence. 
Or imagine ourselves going to a physicist for 
information regarding a self-starting system for 
our automobile, and his prescribing Newton’s laws 
of motion, Boyle’s law, Charles’ law, Lenz’s law, 
Archimedes’ principle, index of refraction, laws of 
falling bodies, law of reflection, law of cooling, 
Ohm’s law, polarization in a cell, specific heat, 
modulus of elasticity, hysteresis, etc., up to 260 
items of unclassified knowledge which the physicist 
is so lacking in a sense of humor as to call serious 
science. 
This is the preparatory fallacy and it runs through- 
out all our subjects. Our method of teaching 
to-day by the study of “fundamental principles” 
is closely analogous to what was in vogue about a 
century ago in the field of grammar, when children 
were required to commit to memory rules of gram-
-P-A-G-E-222
  206 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
mar, to learn syntactical laws of language and acquire 
skill in logical analysis in order that they might 
be prepared to read, write, and speak. The analogy 
goes still further. We have recently heard some- 
thing of an attempt to make physics a little more 
concrete by the interjection here and there of a few 
applications of principles for the sake of elucidating 
these “fundamentals.” It was about 1823 that the 
teaching of rules of grammar was made a trifle more 
concrete by the introduction of sentences to which 
the rules might be applied. For a discussion of 
this sort of teaching grammar see Dr. Briggs’ mono- 
graph in Teachers College Record, Vol. XIV, from 
which it appears that science teachers to-day are in 
perfect accord with English teachers of a century 
ago in attempting to present an adult, scholarly 
interest to children by a logical and metaphysical 
treatment of their subjects. 
“Tradition has perpetuated details which have lost much 
or all of their justification. When old reasons have faded there 
is a tendency to invent new ones to justify practice.” 
This attempt to store facts for future organiza- 
tion is what the Massachusetts Board of Education 
in Bulletin 4, 1912, calls ‘Education in Forgetting.” 
“The structure and habits of the human mind and brain are 
such that following the psychological laws of segmentation, 
unused knowledge tends to be forgotten. Much, a vast deal, 
of the subject-matter turned over and otherwise dealt with by 
the subject-study method is of such a nature that in out-of- 
school hours and in after-school years it remains unused. Ex- 
aminations once passed and the school year ended, subjects are 
forgotten. ... But project study has merits peculiarly its 
own. No more diligent or effective application of the inductive
-P-A-G-E-223
  SCIENCE TEACHING BY PROJECTS 207 
method in education has ever been witnessed than that pro- 
posed, and in good measure already practiced, by the project 
study of agriculture.” 
“The knowledge which is the boy’s quest in project study is 
knowledge of which he sees the need. Being needed year by 
year, it will, year by year, be recalled. Used again and again, 
added to, modified and exactly applied, it will tend to be dis- 
tinctly remembered.” 
“The project method. of education, more, it is believed, than 
all others, takes into account the aptitudes, requirements, and 
accomplishments of individual pupils as these are revealed from 
hour to hour.” 
The Smith-Lever bill which has just passed Con- 
gress appropriates five million dollars annually to 
foster the project method of study in agriculture 
throughout the country. 
The project method in General Science is more 
specialized than any portion of the college prepara- 
tory science, and like a dog pursuing a hare, it has 
a specific aim, albeit it jumps those useless boundary ~ 
fences between the various fields of science. This 
is our justification for the use of the word general. 
The idea of completeness — complete statements 
of facts and principles, is one of the greatest barriers 
to successful teaching. The attempt to teach all 
that is known about each topic results in very little 
being understood about any topic. What is wanted 
is to set the face in the right direction; teach the 
first steps; arrange many facts and many observa- 
tions to point in a similar direction; acquire the 
habit of having one experience suggest another. 
The method is precisely that of the masters of 
research who are, after all, Masters of General Science. 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
208 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
There is no difference between educating for research 
and educating for life. But the high schools and 
colleges have a strong propensity to neglect this, 
their chief duty. It requires continual belaboring 
to get the high schools to do much else than to cram 
facts for college use. The colleges do little else for 
education than to prepare professors’ assistants ; 
professors’ assistants in research, professors’ assist- 
ants in college teaching, professors’ assistants in 
high-school preparation for college. 
One hundred and fifty years ago the academies 
were founded as a protest against the idea which 
dominated the grammar schools of the time that 
education consisted in storing the facts which the 
higher institutions would use. These academies 
were called the people’s colleges. The pupils were 
to be taught wholly according to their own needs. 
But forthwith the process of inbreeding began. 
The teachers appointed for these academies were 
youths recently graduated from college; in effect, 
professors’ assistants who stored data for college 
use, a process as futile to the education of the few 
who went to college as to the many who did not. 
Again the same protest was renewed fifty years ago 
in the founding of public high schools. These were 
to be free from the preparatory fallacy to which 
the academies had fallen victims. 
It remains to be seen whether the high schools, 
which are the people’s colleges of to-day, can be saved 
from repeating this history. During the last twenty 
years we have had committees of ten, of fifteen, of 
seven, and of various other numbers laboring to

saddle the preparatory job upon the under school. 
Perhaps the thing most to be feared is that the col- 
leges may accept General Science and place it in 
the preparatory group. Before this happens we 
must introduce into the school and college the psy- 
chological organization of instruction and suppress 
the preparatory fallacy.

PROJECTS IN SCIENCE 
A CERTAIN man became the possessor of a motor 
boat which filled his summer with projects for 
interesting study. By inquiry, by reading, and by 
experiment, he found that a very small amount of 
gasoline vaporized and mixed with each cylinder 
full of air constituted an explosive mixture which, 
when fired, furnished the power. He found that 
the proportions were fixed within very narrow limits ; 
say, four drops to each quart of air. Varying the 
proportions to either three or five drops would 
result in a weaker explosion; hence the necessity 
of a very careful adjustment in the carburetor. 
To explode this mixture an electric spark must be 
produced inside the cylinder at the proper instant. 
This spark was produced by a battery of dry cells. 
Rubbing together two wires leading from opposite 
terminals of this battery would produce a faint 
spark, but this spark would not explode a mixture 
of gasoline and air; it was not hot enough. Indeed, 
the coal upon the end of his cigar would not explode 
the gasoline and air. A coil of wire surrounding 
a soft iron core must be introduced into the circuit 
to produce a spark having sufficient aise to ignite 
the mixture.

As one searching through an encyclopedia for 
certain information often gets sidetracked upon 
some other search, so this man spent many days 
or even whole weeks passing through one project 
to another. The mysterious action of the coil; 
the tracing of the current through its complete 
circuit; the timing of the spark by means of a 
commutator; the oiling devices; the circulation of 
water for cooling the engine; the clutch for engag- 
ing the engine with the propeller, to go forward or 
backward or stop. All these and many other proj- 
ects seemed to him to be real physics; nay, more 
and better than real physics. 
A second man, possessing an automobile, pursued 
a dozen or two projects of study more absorbing 
than anything else which he had on his mind during 
the whole winter. With books of instruction fur- 
nished by dealers he studied carburetors, throttles, 
chokers, “vacuum feeds,” high-tension magnetos, 
spark plugs, cooling devices, self-starting devices, 
differentials, clutches, gears, countershafts, breaks, 
horns, springs, “‘shock absorbers,” tires, “non-skid” 
devices, mufflers, silencers, steering devices, lighting 
systems, lubrication, storage batteries, cycles, horse- 
power, generators, motors, relative merits of engines 
with four, six, eight, and twelve cylinders, non- 
freezing solutions, thermosyphons, pumps, care of 
varnish, speedometers, ammeters, the retarding of 
the spark on going up a hill, the causes of ‘“knock- 
ing” in an automobile engine, ete. 
A third man bought a small farm and began to 
read farmers’ bulletins which he procured from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  212 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Government Bureau at Prashinigibal For three 
months he was the butt of ridicule as a “literary 
farmer,” but nothing ever took such “a possession 
of his mental faculties as that project of making the 
ten acres produce all the grass it was capable of. 
In the course of a few years, according to an account 
which he published, the neighboring farmers were 
eager to learn how he had succeeded in producing 
seven blades of grass where one had previously 
grown. ‘These studies appeared to him to be real 
botany, nay, more than botany, real science. 
A fourth man spent a few days at Mammoth 
Cave and came back with projects which seemed to 
him to be the most interesting studies in the fields 
of geography, geology, zodlogy, botany, physics, 
and chemistry. He was so enthusiastic over the 
results of these studies that they entered into every 
speech he made for the next year or so. 
A fifth man spent a summer by the seaside and 
heard faintly on a few occasions the sounds of a 
bell buoy anchored four miles away.) He reflected 
upon the problem of what conditions must obtain 
in order that that sound might carry so far. He 
questioned many men and read upon the subject 
until he got his mind possessed with an explana- 
tion which forms the substance of an interesting 
article. 
These five men, all intelligent men — at least 
they are professors — have testified that these 
projects furnished them exceedingly fruitful themes 
for study. They will not admit that those studies 
lacked organization nor that they were desultory and
-P-A-G-E-229

scrappy. None of them was prepared for these 
studies by specializing in those fields any more than 
Pasteur was prepared by his formal education for 
the six or eight great projects which made him one 
of the greatest scientists and the greatest French- 
man that has lived. 
Young people have plenty of projects which we 
may help them to study if we choose. It is not often 
possible to hinder their studying them if we will. 
They furnish the natural means for starting them 
on a scientific career. Why do we require young 
people in school to use a different method of study 
from that used by all of us outside of school? Why 
should we be averse to using methods of study 
in science which are considered eminently proper in 
other departments? Why should instruction be 
for specialization rather than for ‘ magnanimity 
and enlightenment”? Why this mania for codify- 
ing subject matter which has cankered education 
during the last two decades ? 
If the two or three hundred “fundamental prin- 
ciples” in physics, for example, are fundamental, 
why do intelligent people having once learned them 
forget them without regret? Why do engineers 
have little use and much contempt for them? Why 
do those engaged in research in fields of physics 
ignore them? Is it tacitly for purposes of mental 
discipline that they are taught? Are students in 
schools and colleges made into scientists by learn- 
ing the so-called fundamental facts, or by practicing 
the methods of a scientist in finding the solution of 
real problems ?

The following project is taken adilas, notebook 
of a young man who spent a summer on a farm. 
Drowning Trees — A Project 
We dammed a small stream to make a skating 
pond and a place for cutting ice in winter. The 
pond which was thus formed surrounded certain 
trees in the valley which had often suffered for water 
during dry spells. Some of us thought this would 
be a benefit to the trees, inasmuch as they would 
hereafter always have an abundance of water. 
Furthermore, the stream would now deposit about 
the roots of the trees an abundance of the food which 
they would need. In spite of our good intentions, 
however, the trees soon died. Upon inquiry we 
learned that the trees had been drowned. They 
needed air at the roots quite as much as water. We 
were then reminded that a neighbor when he re- 
graded the land in front of his house had built a 
circular retaining wall around a tree to keep the 
earth from being banked against the tree itself 
and excluding the air. Another man said that it 
would do quite as well to pile loose stones against 
the tree and throw earth over them, and let the 
grass grow quite up to the tree. Air would readily 
find its way to the roots through loose soil, as indeed 
it does to all trees. He said that earthworms, 
ground moles, and various burrowing animals loosen 
up the soil and let the air in. The earth is venti- 
lated annually in preparation for the summer crops. 
When water in the ground freezes it expands; we say 
it heaves the ground up. Then when in the spring- 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
PROJECTS IN SCIENCE 215 
time the ice melts and the water drains out, much 
room is left for air to come in. Thus land which 
may be very hard in autumn becomes soft and 
spongy in spring. 
Spring is the time to mend fences. One can dig 
post holes easily then. Spring is the time to cart 
off from the fields the stones which the winter frosts 
have brought to the surface. 
Soils which are too clayey to let the water drain 
out of them may for lack of air sustain only a very 
stunted growth of vegetation. The mixing of gravel 
with such land, thus letting in air, will sometimes 
make it produce abundantly. All soils are im- 
proved by having a network of drains a few feet 
below the surface, so that all the water which will 
drain off may do so. The ideal arrangement for 
plants is a loose, porous soil with air filling all the 
spaces between the particles and only so much 
water present as will cling to the surface of the 
particles. This is called capillary moisture, to 
indicate that the spaces must be very small so that 
water will creep through the soil as kerosene does 
through the lamp wick. 
The care of potted plants requires continual 
thought about maintaining the balance between 
air and water at the roots. If the soil is very rich 
and has little gravel in it and if water is always 
poured on from above, the soil gets packed down so 
hard that air may not enter. The hole in the bottom 
of the pot permits of under-draining, but the water 
soon makes channels down through the mass, and 
it does not spread to all the rootlets. In the hardly
-P-A-G-E-232
  216 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
packed earth they may be suffering for both air and 
water in spite of the fact that the pot is porous and 
that it receives frequent watering. By this con- 
sideration soil may be too rich as well as too poor. 
It must have air and moisture quite as much as 
fertilizing material. If the soil is rightly propor- 
tioned it will suffice to pour water into the saucer. 
The proper amount of both air and water will creep 
through the soil. 
Persons who set out young plants, thinking that 
the tender roots require very soft soil, sometimes 
make the mistake of not packing the dirt around 
them firmly enough. The result is that while they 
get plenty of air they have too little moisture. 
Moisture creeps by capillarity through very small 
spaces, not large ones. If the soil is properly pro- 
portioned the best way is to press it as firmly as 
one can around young plants when they are first 
being set out. 
The surface of the ground should be frequently 
scratched over to make the spaces between -the 
particles at the surface too large for the water to 
creep by capillarity quite to the surface and pass 
off by evaporation. This is one great reason for 
hoeing, harrowing, and cultivating fields. Another 
is to kill weeds. 
Some people have asked whether earthworms 
rain down since they are seen in such great numbers 
crawling on the surface of the ground after a rain 
storm. The fact is that they crawl out of the 
ground to get air, having been drowned out. They 
cannot live without air as long as the trees and
-P-A-G-E-233
  PROJECTS IN SCIENCE 217 
some other plants can. There are certain plants, 
however, which are able to live in earth that is per- 
petually flooded with water, as we see about all 
ponds and streams. 
In winter, when there is lack of air and water at 
the roots, lack of heat to stimulate chemical activities, 
lack of green matter in leaves to respond to the 
actinic ray of the sun, plants put winter blankets 
upon their buds and on their root tips and remain 
dormant.

THE NATURAL METHOD! 
WE sometimes hear it said that one cannot 
teach applications of physical principles until the 
principles themselves are understood. I wish to 
contend that only the converse of this proposition 
is true. That is, we cannot teach the principles 
of physics except through an experience with their 
applications. Of course these principles were first 
learned by mankind through their manifold appli- 
cations in nature, and I venture to say that with 
each one of us it has been true that the principles 
which we did grasp in our pupil days were those for 
which we had been prepared by previous experi- 
ence, and there were many principles taught us 
which we did not comprehend until later in life 
when we had met the experience necessary for their 
comprehension. 
In a very real sense one studies physics from his 
birth to his grave irrespective of his formal educa- 
tion. The function of the school should be to help 
the pupil to interpret his experiences. When we 
find physics very difficult the probability is that 
we are trying to build without the necessary ground- 
1 Abstract of an address delivered before the Eastern Association of 
Physics Teachers, Boston, 1915. 
218
-P-A-G-E-235
  THE NATURAL METHOD 219 
work of experience. The extra-academic study of 
physics which each one of us pursues through our 
experiences during the whole of life is of vastly 
greater importance than the formal study of that 
subject in schools. One may be a master of physics 
without the formal study, but he can have no com- 
prehension of the subject at all without the projects 
which grow out of life’s experiences. The char- 
acteristic of education which has been most often 
noted is the tendency to teach “fundamental prin- 
ciples” without rooting them in experience. 
The person who hangs upon the strap in a street 
car and has acquired the habit of reflecting upon 
his experience finds it natural to say when the car 
starts and he has to tug upon the strap to get him- 
self started, “A body at rest tends to remain at rest.” 
When the car stops and he pulls on the strap in the 
effort to bring his one hundred and fifty pounds to 
rest it is not difficult for him to say, “A body in 
motion tends to continue in motion,” and when the 
car turns a corner he learns by his tussle with the 
strap that “A moving body tends to continue mov- 
ing in a straight line.” 
Projects in physics begin with learning to walk, 
learning to walk on stilts, learning to skate, to swim, 
to swing, to teeter, to “snap the whip,” to play “duck 
on a rock,” to ride horseback, to ride a bicycle, to 
sail a boat, to fly kites, to curve a baseball, to play 
billiards, to make water wheels, to shoot, to fish, 
etc, These projects are invariably studied by the 
method of “trial and error.” These are not pas- 
times, although they are play. They are very
-P-A-G-E-236
220 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
effective studies in physics. They furnish the means 
for “organizing common sense” according to Hux- 
ley’s definition of science. 
Let me suggest a new type of college entrance 
examination for physics. Have the candidate move 
a heavy log. If he attacks it in the middle and 
gives up, reject him. If he moves it by lifting at 
the end, admit him. Have the candidate step on 
and off a moving platform. If he does it grace- 
fully, receive him. If he falls headlong, refuse him. 
Have the candidate discharge a sling. If he hits 
the mark, admit him to college. If he hits the 
umpire, condition him. Have the candidate tend 
a hot-air furnace. If he adjusts all the drafts and 
dampers wisely, admit him. If he shuts the “cold- 
air box” to keep out the cold, as many of his profes- 
sors do, reject him. 
This is the age of machinery, when a majority of 
intelligent folk would rather know about an auto- 
mobile than to know much about the college type 
of physics. 
Our so-called thoroughness is rather wooden. 
One hundred men know about the differential 
of an automobile; ninety of them know what 
it is for; nine of them know about its anatomy, 
and one, knowing what it is desired to accomplish, 
can design it. The first group are the owners; the 
second, the chauffeurs; and the last man is the 
chief engineer at the factory. Each has the knowl- 
edge that he needs. It is not necessary to call the 
first group “smatterers.” Some of them are likely 
to be doctors of philosophy, and hence are supposed
-P-A-G-E-237
  
THE NATURAL METHOD 221 
not to be victims of “soft pedagogy” or “kinder- 
garten methods.” If occasion demands additional 
knowledge, the natural advance is in the order stated 
above; namely: First, What is it for? Second, the 
details of its structure. Third, the invention of the 
device. Teachers of physics sometimes try to re- 
verse this order, and when the inevitable failure 
results, their subterfuge is to charge the world with 
lack of thoroughness.

The above table shows the high-school situation 
in a nutshell. Such phenomenal growth has of ne- 
cessity produced conditions which are embarrassing. 
Less than one hundred years ago, there was but 
one high school in the whole United States — The 
English High School in Boston. It was seventeen 
years before the second one was established — that 
was in Philadelphia. Five years later the third one 
was started in Providence, and the fourth one came 
in Hartford in 1847 — 26 years after the first one. 
There were only 40 high schools in the United 
States in 1860, when some of us were beginning our 
education. When I began teaching in the high 
1 Abstract of an address delivered before the New York Chemistry 
Teachers’ Club in 1917. 
222
-P-A-G-E-239
THE HIGH-SCHOOL SITUATION 223 
schools, there were 800, and the 1914 report of the 
United States Commissioner of Education gives 
the number as 13,714. There are, at this present 
date, probably 15,000. Buildings, equipment, and 
teaching force have not kept pace with that rapid 
increase in the number of schools. I say unhesitat- 
ingly that we are not as well off for rooms in which 
to teach, nor for equipment with which to teach, nor 
for teachers as we were 36 years ago. And this is but 
the necessary consequence of our astonishing growth. 
When I began to teach, those 800 high schools 
were all little affairs, averaging perhaps 25 pupils 
each. There were not so many high-school pupils 
in the whole country then as there are now in some 
single high schools. We have several high schools 
in New York City now that have more pupils than 
all the United States had when I began to teach. 
The pupils now number about 1,500,000 against, say, 
four or five thousand in the whole country then. 
Think what the situation was like 36 years ago. 
I recall it very distinctly. One was apt to have 
about 6 pupils in the chemistry class. We had 
laboratories then as we have now, and with 6 pupils 
—all American born — homogeneous — there was 
no reason why one should not do good teaching, at 
least the best he was capable of. If what some one 
has said be true, that the instruction which each 
pupil receives is inversely proportional to the num- 
ber of pupils in a class, there can be no good teach- 
ing in the great high schools of to-day. When we 
reflect upon the large number of pupils that a teacher 
has to handle in each recitation, the large number of
-P-A-G-E-240
  224 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
recitations each day, the care of apparatus in such 
large quantities, the necessity of ordering apparatus 
and supplies a whole year ahead of time and then 
rarely getting what one orders, the high-school situ- 
ation seems not only embarrassing but impossible. 
I recall that I secured during the years I taught in 
the high schools the privilege of buying directly 
from an appropriation whatever I needed, and I 
also had the privilege of planning the work — there 
was no syllabus, and no specific college requirement. 
It was a free hand for teaching individual pupils 
according to their needs. 
When schools were small, a teacher was not all 
the while being supervised and super-supervised as 
at present. A teacher who knew his job was not 
then handicapped by the supervision of those who 
knew it not. This is a familiar feature of the great 
systems of to-day. . 
In those days when schools were small, politics 
did not enter. It was not worth while. 
In those days we did not have a mongrel lot of 
pupils of all races not yet amalgamated. Only 
those got into the high schools who were fairly alike, 
intelligent persons, coming from intelligent families. 
I do not think the tax-payer is slow in appreciating 
the value of the schools of to-day. One-third of his 
taxes goes to the schools and the high schools get 
about one-fifth of the school tax. We are spending 
on the education of each high-school pupil about five 
times as much yearly as we did thirty-six years ago 
but I believe we are giving him poorer instruction. 
Another condition which may not be called em-
-P-A-G-E-241
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL SITUATION 225 
barrassing, but which I am sure we do not provide 
for adequately, is that the girls predominate very 
largely over the boys, and we generally plan for the 
boys and do not think of the girls. The percentage 
of girls in our high schools is increasing. Ten years 
ago 48 per cent of the pupils were boys and 52 per 
cent girls. To-day 44 per cent are boys and 56 per 
cent are girls. And when it comes to graduates, 40 
per cent of the graduating classes are boys and 60 
per cent are girls. The girls continue longer in the 
high schools and go to college in about equal num- 
bers with the boys. When I was a college student, 
a college girl was a rare, not to say a unique, 
thing, anywhere in the country. Almost all the 
colleges and universities now receive women as well 
as men. I can at this moment think of but four 
institutions that exclude women from candidacy 
for the undergraduate degrees. There are a large 
number of institutions, chiefly state universities, 
that have more women than men. The college 
women seem to be likely, in the near future, to gain 
more prizes, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, than 
the men. And if in the future, as in the recent past, 
men in the community continue to drift into office 
work and women continue to drift into the control of 
practical affairs, it will soon be true that women will 
surpass men in their knowledge of physical science. 
Another item in the high-school situation which is 
worthy of comment is the fact that out of 13,715 
high schools, 10,547 are schools with only 3 teachers 
each. Very few high schools — three or four hun- 
dred — have specialized teachers of any particular 
Q
-P-A-G-E-242
  226 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
science. In the face of this fact we have recently 
undertaken to equip teachers for the schools with 
that dense ignorance which characterizes specialists. 
This is doubtless a passing phase in secondary 
education. 
Thirty-six years ago, the value of the books in the 
high-school library was many times the value of the 
apparatus for science teaching. Now the figures 
are: sixteen million dollars for scientific apparatus 
against six million volumes in the library. The 
“scientific apparatus” has not much to do with the 
interpretation of life and should give place to “‘com- 
mercial stuff,” but the most disgraceful thing about 
the present situation is that the libraries do not 
contain anything useful. A lot of the high schools 
have in their libraries no books of science that any 
one reads. Meanwhile the community outside of 
the schools is reading much that should gain ad- 
mission to the school libraries as a real aid to science 
instruction. 
Not only have the schools within the last third 
of a century become overcrowded with pupils, but 
they are greatly overcrowded with subjects, the 
number having increased from half a dozen to more 
than two dozen in typical high schools. 
The greatest cause for embarrassment, however, is 
our changing ideas concerning the purpose for teach- 
ing any subject. Three or four decades ago, if 
we wanted to indicate that a man had great knowl- 
edge, we always attributed to him great powers of 
memory. President or professor so and so was a 
wonderfully bright man because he could remember
-P-A-G-E-243
THE HIGH-SCHOOL SITUATION 227 
the old students and call them by name whenever 
they came back to visit alma mater. Afterward it 
dawned upon us that a table waiter surpassed pro- 
fessors and presidents in the matter of memory. I 
remember one of the first shocks I got on that theory 
of education. Many years ago while attending a 
teachers’ convention at Saratoga several hundred of 
us passed into the hotel dining room and a big, 
burly negro took our hats without checking them. 
When we came out he astonished us by handing 
each his own hat. And I said, ‘‘ What is the use of 
a college education?”

THE AIMS AND METHODS OF SCIENCE 
TEACHING 
Tue aims and methods of science are best por- 
trayed in the lives and labors of those masters of 
science who have lived since the time of Galileo, 
notably Pasteur and. Faraday. These aims and 
methods are now so generally approved and applied 
by the teachers of all subjects that the “scientific” 
method no longer distinguishes the science work 
from other work in the schools. Science teaching, 
if it follows the examples of Pasteur, Faraday, etc., 
may not justly be differentiated from other subjects 
as materialistic or lacking in cultural or humani- 
tarian elements. 
The purpose of science teaching in all grades of 
schools is not chiefly to impart knowledge of subject 
matter but to train persons in the method of the 
masters, which is invariably the project method. 
This is the method used by intelligent men in achiev- 
ing their ends, in school or out. 
A project is characterized in the words of Pro- 
fessor Mann as follows : 
“(1) A desire to understand the meaning and use of some fact, 
phenomenon, or experience. This leads to questions and prob- 
lems. (2) A conviction that it is worth while and possible to 
228
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE AIMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING 229 
secure an understanding of the thing in question. This causes 
one to work with an impelling interest. (8) The gathering from 
experience, books, and experiments of the needed information, 
and the application of this information to answer the question 
in hand.” 
A project, or problem, differs from and is superior 
to a topic in that (1) a project originates in some 
question, and not in such a logical sequence of ideas 
as may be found in codified subject matter. In 
teaching from the so-called “logical” texts one 
wrongly attempts to induce pupils to accept topics 
as their own projects. Logical organization of 
such material as functions in life will be the final 
result of a protracted study of projects. (2) The 
project involves the active and motivated partici- 
pation of the pupil in carrying it out. It does not, 
therefore, like the topic lend itself to didactic, formal 
treatment in which the teacher does all the think- 
ing and the pupil passively absorbs. (3) Projects 
furnish a basis for the selection of facts according 
to value or significance, topics furnish no such basis 
for selection. (4) The project seldom ends in a 
complete, final, or absolutely finished conclusion. 
It is, therefore, far less likely than is the topic to 
leave the pupil with the idea that he has heard the 
last word on the subject. It leaves him open- 
minded. The project, or problem method of teach- 
ing when well done leaves the pupil with a well- 
organized mass of useful information plus a method 
of work which will lead him to continue to acquire 
more. This entire discussion arises from the fact that 
the logical, topical method has failed to do just this. 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  230 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Children and adults alike are endowed by nature 
with the elements of the scientific spirit. The pur- 
pose of science teaching is accomplished most suc- 
cessfully when the science classes merely furnish 
and shape an environment in which the scientific 
spirit may grow. Under the direction of a teacher 
who comprehends the workings of the mind, the 
project method duplicates the methods of active 
life and thus prepares the pupil for independent 
thinking. 
The present need of the schools is for a large col- 
lection of sample projects, or problems, which may 
be used in showing teachers in a given community 
how to devise and utilize projects adapted to dif- 
ferent grades of pupils in their own environment. 
The curriculum is the sum of such projects. It 
must always remain in a state of flux.
-P-A-G-E-247
XVIII 
THE IMITATION OF THE MASTERS! 
In using the project method, one does not begin 
with a topic or a caption like a proposition in geom- 
etry. The project is in its nature less formal, less 
conscious of what conclusion is to be reached. It 
cannot, if genuine, proceed according to a plan of 
organization imposed by another. It works toward 
conclusions which may be far distant. It is merely 
the method of research adapted to the age and ca- 
pacity of the individual. It works toward defi- 
nitions and fundamental principles rather than from 
them. In short, it reverses the prevailing order of 
school procedure and follows the natural method of 
scientific workers. 
Any one who has observed the innumerable at- 
tempts during the past quarter of a century to codify 
logically the subject matter of science for school 
programs, any one who has listened to the academic 
and endless discussions regarding the syllabus which 
engage the attention of teachers’ conventions, must 
sometimes feel that high-school and college courses 
in science are designed to kill research, which is, after 
all, merely the method of intelligent life. 
Our “‘text-books” in physics and chemistry are

men at University of Pennsylvania, April 11, 1918. 
231  
-P-A-G-E-248
232 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
chiefly encyclopedias, or, in some cases, dictionaries. 
They are not, properly speaking, text-books. They 
should be treated as books of reference. They are 
not courses of study. Those who call project study 
a hodgepodge and oppose to it what they call a 
logical arrangement, or a plan of organization of 
subject matter, are thinking of these so-called text- 
books as study plans. One might as well hope to 
get history from an encyclopedia as science from an 
encyclopedic text-book. Real science instruction 
follows a different kind of organization from that of 
the encyclopedia or the dictionary. We get liter- 
ature from Shakespeare, not from the dictionary. 
But Shakespeare is a hodgepodge from the stand- 
point of the lexicographer, Shakespeare is not ar- 
ranged alphabetically. And the orderly projects of 
Pasteur are a hodgepodge from the standpoint of 
some of our elementary science texts. 
Dictionaries, encyclopedias, and such text-books 
as we now have are very satisfactory books of 
reference. But students in schools and colleges 
should have books which present science as living 
projects. They should read as many books in sci- 
ence as they read in literature. No scientist has 
ever developed without this reading habit. He who 
will study the lives of the masters of science will 
find that they were all great readers. They were 
also rebellious against the formalism of the schools. 
And they pursued projects in science apart from 
teachers and schools. These projects have an or- 
ganization unknown to the schools but known and 
approved by all of the masters of science.

THE IMITATION OF THE MASTERS 233 
I suggest books, not as a side issue, but books 
to be used as the teachers of English use books, a 
dozen or more a year for each pupil, not the same 
books year after year. We have hundreds to choose 
from. 
Among the books, which students should read and 
report upon, are scores of biographies of the scien- 
tists, histories of the development of science and 
invention, original monographs of the work of 
scientists, such books as John Tyndall and Silvanus 
Thompson wrote on scientific subjects, etc., ete. 
The great masters of science, Galileo, Faraday, 
Pasteur, Darwin, etc., illustrated in all their lives 
and work the project method. The intelligent man 
illlustrates it in all his work outside of the field of 
education. High-school pupils use the project 
method in all their self-directed work outside of 
school. But when the schoolmaster undertakes to 
direct the pursuit for knowledge, he formalizes, he 
systematizes, he schematizes, and invariably inverts 
the natural order of learning. The result is that 
our young people are getting their real science through 
various outside agencies. 
About the time of our Revolutionary War there 
lived in the parish of Selborne, England, an excellent 
exponent of the project method. His name was 
Gilbert White. He roamed the fields and woods to 
see what he should see and made notes of his ob- 
servations upon a great variety of subjects. His 
book, published under the title Natural History of 
Selborne, is still a classic. 
Very perfect illustrations of the project method
-P-A-G-E-250
    234 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
are to be found in the works of Galileo, Davy, Fara- 
day, etc., but Louis Pasteur was the greatest master 
of the project method and nowhere is the method 
better presented than in The Life of Pasteur by his 
son-in-law, René Vallery-Radot, Doubleday, Page 
& Co. 
It is easier, and perhaps more important, to tell 
what the project method is not, than what it is. It 
is not “merely an entertainment for the young 
who are not yet ready for serious science.” There 
seems to be an impression that the project method 
is somehow connected with the general science 
movement and that the whole matter has to do with 
young children. It is quite as important that high- 
school and college students should learn the scientific 
method as that junior high-school pupils should do so. 
It is not ‘‘a device for getting hold of deficient 
students and keeping them from making trouble or 
from leaving school.” This argument has been 
used for the introduction into the schools of in- 
dustrial education and a multitude of subjects. 
It was very much used to help the introduction of 
science into the schools a generation ago. But such 
considerations are too trifling for us. 
Nor are we concerned with the question whether 
incompetent teachers can handle it. Every sug- 
gestion for improvement in the schools meets the 
knock-down argument that incompetent teachers 
may not be able to handle it. 
The project method is not ‘“‘some new thing.” 
We are not engaged in promoting new philosophies 
for fickle Athenians. It is not something to be “
-P-A-G-E-251
  
THE IMITATION OF THE MASTERS 235 
stereotyped and printed in a “text-book” and sold 
to the schools of a nation to be memorized by a 
million unhappy pupils. It is not “soft pedagogy,” 
nor “a hodgepodge,” nor “an unorganized mass,” 
nor is it “desultory and scrappy,” nor “a royal 
road to learning.” It is none of those things which 
its pettifogging, hypercritical foes say of it, and it is 
not much of what its superzealous friends say of it. 
If it is true, as I believe it is, that the project 
must always arise in some “cross-road situation,” 
some doubt as to the next step, some question, vital 
and impelling because of its personal interest, then 
air is not a project. No intelligent person inquires 
about the air, and no free person would submit to 
the protracted instruction which we expect the young 
people to endure upon that topic. If we spend the 
first month teaching them what they already know 
about air and the second month teaching them what 
they can never care to know about it, we should 
expect that the intelligent among them would vote 
that “science is the most useless study in school.” 
Nor may we help the matter by calling this sort 
of thing general science, or project study, as some 
misguided persons do. If, however, a pupil says, as 
one did tq me, “I can understand the use of a pro- 
peller to a ship in water, but how a propeller may be 
useful to an airship is a mystery to me,” we have 
a challenge to enter the topic of the air by way of a 
project. And if we satisfy the inquirer so that he 
will come again, the chances are that we are good 
teachers. But if we persistently put aside such 
questions as irrelevant to our scheme, we shall not
-P-A-G-E-252
  236 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
long have inquirers, and it is fairly certain that 
we shall not be rated as good teachers. 
Heat is not a project. But when the first subway 
opened in New York and men, expecting a cool 
ride to their offices on a hot summer day, found 
it hotter than the street, a project in heat arose 
which inspired diligent study on the part of many. 
Combustion is not a project. But when, about a 
century ago, the coal mines of England were likely to 
be abandoned on account of the frequent explosions 
of fire damp, Humphry Davy had a project in com- 
bustion, kindling temperature, and whatnot, which 
resulted in the miner’s safety lamp. 
It is not necessary that project study by high- 
school and college students should always involve 
experimental work. To read a description of proj- 
ect study by a master scientist is often more profit- 
able. 
Projects do not often confine themselves to one 
topic. It is their nature to overflow these artificial 
boundaries. In this connection one cannot fail to 
think of the farm projects that are engaging the 
minds of some of us. 
According to Pasteur, a project has more to do 
with the general and everyday happenings of nature 
than it has with academic specialization. 
Pasteur, the greatest scientist France has known, 
and, by their own election, the greatest Frenchman, 
had great difficulty in gaining admission to the 
Academy of Science because, as he said, the mem- 
bers were such narrow specialists that they could 
not appreciate a piece of research.
-P-A-G-E-253
    
THE IMITATION OF THE MASTERS 237 
They thought, because he examined crystals 
with polarized light, he must be a physicist... But 
they sought him in vain among the ranks of the 
physicists. Because he studied crystals, they 
thought he might be a mineralogist. But he was 
not to be found in their ranks. Because he analyzed 
those crystals, he should be a chemist. But he was 
working upon fermentation at the time and that was 
not the business of pure chemistry. And so the 
founder of the doctrine of isomerism was rejected. 
This was in 1857, when Pasteur was thirty-five years 
old. 
In 1861 Biot, on account of researches pursued 
by Pasteur, nominated him for membership in the 
Botanical section of the Institute, saying, “I can 
hear the commonplace objection: he is a chemist, 
a physicist, not a professional botanist. But that 
very versatility should be in his favor.” He was 
rejected. 
In 1862, when Pasteur was forty years of age, 
this chemist, physicist, mineralogist, botanist, zodlo- 
gist, physiologist, and, more than all, this scientist 
was elected to membership in the Academy of 
Science only by the sheer weight of influence of 
two great men, his great friends, Biot and Dumas. 
Pasteur, the man who put medicine upon a 
scientific basis, was barely elected (by one vote) to 
the Academy of Medicine. This was in 1873, when 
he was fifty-one years of age. He was at the time 
world famous and the holder of an honorary M.D. 
degree from a foreign university. At every incur- 
sion on the domain of medicine he was looked upon  
-P-A-G-E-254
238 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
by specialists as a chemist who was poaching on the 
preserves of others. The physicians and surgeons 
called Pasteur a physiological chemist and said that 
physiology can have no connection with medicine 
and they considered it a waste of time to listen to a 
chemist.” Pasteur maintained “that science was 
indeed one and all-embracing and that all sciences 
gain by mutual support.”” At sixty years of age 
“he vehemently opposed the false idea that each 
science should restrict itself within its own limita- 
tions.” 
His life had been given to the study and the teach- 
ing of such varied projects as isomerism, fermenta- 
tion, spontaneous generation, the diseases of wine 
and beer, silkworm diseases, fowl cholera, swine 
fever, splenic fever, and hydrophobia. His stu- 
dents acquired not a taste but a passion for study. 
His greatest ambition in life was to serve humanity. 
“Nothing,” said he, “is more agreeable to a man 
who has made science his career than to increase the 
number of discoveries, but his cup of joy is full 
when the result of his observations is put to im- 
mediate practical use.” 
“His great intuition, his imagination, which 
equaled that of any poet, often carried him to a 
summit whence an immense horizon lay before 
him.” 
We are now reaching the stage when many are 
attempting to define the project method. Educators 
are prone to separate into camps and schools over 
definitions, and many good ideas fail of realization 
in the schools because of partisan discussions.
-P-A-G-E-255

Christ illustrated Christianity by His life and it 
may be doubted whether He has ever been misun- 
derstood. But Paul wrote more than half of the 
New Testament to define Christianity and the 
church fathers have written countless volumes to ? 
expound it with the result that hundreds of warring | 
sects have been formed and Christianity has been 
almost lost in a fog of dogma and debate. 
The only way to appreciate the project method 
in the pursuit of science is to study its exemplifica- 
tion in the lives of its masters. It must be acquired 
through imitation of the masters. The greatest 
teacher of science in America was Louis Agassiz. 
One summer of association with him on the little 
island of Penikese, with the intimate relationship 
of disciple to a master, produced that galaxy of 
scientific men: Apgar, Brooks, Crosby, Guyot, 
Holder, Jordan, Minot, Morse, Packard, Putnam, 
Shaler, Wilder, etc. 
Most great scientists have been disciples and 
imitators of other great scientists. 
No one can teach the scientific method unless he 
is himself a scientist and the scientist must teach 
more by example than by precept.

  PRACTICAL PHYSICS 
By N. HENRY BLACK 
Science Master in the Roxbury Latin School, Boston   
AND 
Proressor HARVEY N. DAVIS 
Of Harvard University 
Cloth, 12mo, Illustrated, ix and 487 pages, $1.25 
The remarkable record that this text has made in the short period 
it has been on the market is sufficient testimony as to its adaptability 
to high school needs. And it is not difficult to sum up the features 
of the book that give it preéminence in its field. 
It is written by experts in the field who are, moreover, thoroughly 
acquainted with the needs and limitations of the high school course. 
It is practical in fact as well asin name. It connects the funda- 
mental principles of physics with the everyday affairs of life, by 
introducing each subject through some familiar experience, by using 
the appliances of modern industrial and commercial life as illustra- 
tions of the principles studied, and by suggesting research questions 
at ends of chapters that send pupils afield for information. 
The rate of progress is adjusted to the ability of the average class 
to proceed. The pace is slow in the early part of the book, more 
rapid later. Topics under any one subject are arranged in what 
experience has shown to be the most teachable order. 
The manner of presentation shows exceptional skill in the actual 
work of teaching. The method is inductive and pedagogically 
sound — first, the familiar facts, then the underlying principles, then 
the application to less familiar facts. New subjects are introduced 
by illustrations from daily life — ot by definitions. Principles are 
introduced by illustrative experiments or by appeal to familiar ex- 
perience — wot stated first and illustrated afterwards.

Elementary Biology — Animal and Human . . . . . |n12 
This book, a product of many years of successful teaching experi- 
ence in secondary schools, emphasizes throughout the relation of the 
science of biology to human welfare. Both matter and method are 
chosen with reference to this end. Structure and classification are not 
neglected, but they are made subordinate to function, because the lat- 
ter is more significant for boys and girls of high school age. The 
activities of plants and animals and their use by man are shown to be 
closely related to human welfare, for example, the use of plants for 
food and clothing; the relation of mosquitoes to malaria and yellow 
fever and of flies to typhoid fever; the work of bees and silkworms; 
the importance of birds as destroyers of insects; the work of bacteria 
as the friends or as the foes of man, etc. 
The significant character of the book is further emphasized by sim- 
plicity of style, abundant half-tone illustrations, chapter summaries, and 
interesting laboratory exercises. Text and laboratory manual are com- 
bined in one. In the appendix are found valuable suggestions for 
teachers and pupils concerning laboratory equipment, special topics, 
notebooks, and reference books.

Chemistry: An Elementary Textbook 
By Witiram Concer Morean ann James A. LYMAN 
List Price, $1.25 
The facts of everyday life are here utilized and made an 
essential part of chemical science. With the practical appli- 
cation of principles is combined scientific accuracy and com- 
pleteness. The treatment has been made interesting without 
any sacrifice of thoroughness. The questions following each 
chapter serve at once to provoke thought and to relate the 
science of chemistry to the experiences of common life. 
Elementary Household Chemistry 
By Joun Frercuson SNELL 
List Price, $1.25 
A textbook in which chemical principles are developed and 
illustrated with special reference to the fields of the girl stu- 
dent’s natural activities. The chemistry of foods and cookery, 
of dyes and soaps, of paints and cleansers, of bacteria and 
fermentation is carefully and scientifically developed. 
Chemistry and Its Relations to Daily Life 
By Louis KaHLeENBERG AND Epwin B. Hart 
List Price, $1.25 
Designed particularly for students of agriculture and home

crease the efficiency of the farm and the home. Useful 
facts rather than mere theory have been emphasized, 
although the theory has not been neglected.

Professor of the History of Education, Teachers College, Columbia University; 
Author of “A Text-Book in the History of Education,” “ Brief 
Course in the History of Education,” etc. 
The need of such work is evidenced: By the great mass of varied educa- 
tional literature showing an equal range in educational practice and theory; 
by the growing importance of the school as a social institution, and the fuller 
recognition of education as a social process; and by the great increase in the 
number of teachers and the instability of tenure which at the same time marks 
the profession. 
The men who need it are: All teachers, professional men, editors, min- 
isters, legislators, all public men who deal with large questions of public 
welfare intimately connected with education — every one who appreciates the 
value of a reference work which will give him the outlines of any educational 
problem, the suggested solutions, the statistical information, and in general 
the essential facts necessary to its comprehension. 
Among the departmental editors associated with Dr. Monroe are Dr. 
EMER E. Brown, U. S. Commissioner of Education, Prof. E. F. BUCHNER,

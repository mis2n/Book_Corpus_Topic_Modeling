PREFACE 
After many years of experience as an international lecturer 
and teacher of the various branches of the science and art 
of garment-making, and by request of thousands of American 
women, the author has been led to write this book, “American 
Dressmaking Step by Step.” Its purpose is to answer the 
questions and work out the problems which have been and are 
now asked of her daily by the home and professional dressmaker 
and the novice. The author has endeavored to present this instruc- 
tion and information as briefly as possible in a clear, concise, 
comprehensible series of lessons, and in the manner easiest under- 
stood, quickest acquired, and most successfully applied. 
The woman who knows practically nothing about sewing or 
dressmaking must be taught from the beginning. In this book she 
will find a complete, consecutive, and systematic arrangement of 
lessons keyed with references, so that she may learn where to begin, 
what to do first, how to proceed with the development of the gar- 
ment, and how to correctly apply the finishing touches. 
When making a garment, even an experienced sewer is some- 
times at a loss to know -how to handle some particular peint or 
problem. Therefore, each step of each lesson is keyed so that 
without waste of time or attention she may refer directly to the 
specific instruction desired, just as she would refer to a dictionary 
or encyclopedia for other information. 
To avoid repetition, the text has been consecutively arranged 
and each subject handled as a separate lesson. When the same 
problem appears later in the book, the detailed instruction is not 
repeated, but attention is called to the lesson in which that particular 
subject has been fully considered. Therefore, it is necessary at all 
times to follow carefully the references given and the “step by 
step” outline according to the arrangement found in this volume. 
The author believes that this book, “American Dressmaking 
Step by Step,” presents the course in contents, form, and method 
most needed by the majority of women, and she earnestly hopes 
that it will greatly assist them to make their own garments, bring- 
ing out the maximum of beauty of style, line, and effect, with the 
minimum of time, labor, and money.

CHAPTER I 
SEWING AND DRESSMAKING ACCESSORIES 
Lesson 1 
HE articles usually required for use in sewing and dressmaking 
are: 
1. Needles 9. ‘Tape Measure 
2. Thread 10. Yardstick 
8. Thimble 11. Tailors’ Chalk 
4. Pins 12. Skirt-marker 
5. Emery 13. Dress-form 
6. Cutting-shears 14. Sewing-machine 
7. Scissors 15. Pressing Supplies 
8. Buttonhole-scissors 16. Patterns. 
Needles 
In sewing, the size of the needle depends upon the eye adjustment 
of the sewer, the texture of the material and the size of the thread. A 
needle should be chosen which can be threaded and used without un- 
necessary eye strain. It should be just large enough to carry the thread 
through the material without bending the needle. 
Sewing Needles are of three kinds: 
1. Sharps, which are long needles used in general dressmaking. 
2. Ground Downs, a medium length needle used for fine sewing. 
3. Betweens, a short needle used in tailoring. 
Millinery Needles are long pointed needles used for basting in dress- 
making. 
Needles with Large Eyes and Pointed Ends are: 
1. Crewel Needles 
2. Darning Needles 
8. Embroidery Needles 
Needles with Large Eyes and Blunt Ends are: 
1, Bodkins 
2. Tape Needles 
3. Tapestry Needles 
Threads 
Threads are of three kinds: 
1. Silk used to sew silk, wool, or silk and wool materials. 
2. Cotton used to sew cotton materials. 
8. Linen used for strong sewing on cotton and linen materials.

The following schedule will assist in choosing needles and threads 
which can be used well together:

10— 20 30- 40 2 
20— 24 40— 60 3

120-160 200-220 000 11 
160-200 220-250 12 
The Thimble 
The thimble should be of silver, aluminum, or celluloid. In size it 
should fit the middle or longest finger of the right hand. In length it 
should allow perfect freedom of the first joint of the finger upon which 
it is used. 
Pins 
Any pins used in dressmaking should either be made of steel or be 
small pins of good quality. They should have very sharp points so as 
not to mark the material or cut the threads. 
Emery 
An emery with which to polish rough needles will be found useful. 
An emery bag can be made, shaping the bag like a pincushion. 
Shears and Scissors 
A pair of large cutting-shears 8 to 10 inches long and a pair of scissors 
from 8 to 5 inches long are needed. ‘The shears should be very sharp so 
that they will not haggle the material. When cutting, keep the flat, 
wide part of the shears on the table. If buttonhole-scissors are desired 
they should be about 5 inches long. 
Tape Measure and Y ardstick 
A tape measure and a yardstick are needed constantly in dressmaking. 
Choose a tape measure 14 inch wide and if possible one numbering from 
both ends of the measure. The yardstick should be at least one inch wide.

  8 Sewing and Dressmaking Accessories Lesson 1   
Tailors’ Chalk 
Ths » cig 3 ple roIns = 1 ; = Lailors’ chalk is used to mark margins, construction points, hem 
turnings, etc. It is very inexpensive and a box containing several colors 
is a useful addition to the dressmaking supplies. 
Skirt-marker 
A skirt-marker is used to mark the desired length on a skirt. Any 
good hem-marker will do, or you may notch pasteboard the exact number 
of inches the skirt is to hang from the floor. 
  Dress-form 
If you do your own dressmaking, or have it done in your home, you 
will find a dress-form invaluable, not only as a means to secure correct, 
and perfect lines and insure a well-fitting garment, but to save yourself 
the time and tediousness of trying on your gowns. 
In order to get the greatest benefit from your dress-form it should be 
adjusted until it exactly represents your own lines, proportions and size 
in every respect. This is easily done in the following manner: 
1. Pad or adjust the dress-form to your own measurements. 
2. Make a tight-fitting lining, fitting it over your body, to make 
a duplicate of your figure. 
8. Then dress the form in the same corset, corset-cover, and _petti- 
coat over which the garment is to be worn.    
Sewing-machine 
A good sewing-machine is most important in garment-making. Study 
your machine until you understand how to use and care for it correctly 
and make any adjustments necessary. Information of this character is 
usually given by the firms handling machines, as different machines 
operate in accordance with their type. One should become familiar 
with each of the machine attachments, as hours of laborious work can be 
saved by the use of the ruffler, hemmers, binders, etc. 
  The Pressing Supplies 
Detailed information concerning the pressing-boards, pressing-cloths 
and other pressing articles will be found in Lesson 4. 
The Pattern 
There has been nothing added to the modern conveniences which has 
meant more to the average home woman than paper patterns. These 
patterns can be purchased for any garment for a few cents. They supply 
line, style, size, and the various other helps which make it possible for 
women to make their own clothes in a stylish, up-to-date manner. For 
full information as to the paper pattern and its use see Chapter IV.

THE WEAVE, FOLD, AND PREPARATION OF MATERIALS 
Lesson 2—Tur Weave (Illustration II-1) 
1. The Selvedge is 
the outside edge or 
woven border of ma- 
terials. 
2. The Warp of 
materialsisthelength- 
wise threads, or the 
threads running in the 
same direction in 
which the selvedge is 
woven. 
8. The Woof of 
materials runs across 
and over and under 
the warp threads, and 
in an opposite direc- 
tion to the selvedge. 
4. The Grain of 
materials runs with 
and in the same direc- 
tion as the warp 
threads. 
The Fold 
1. The Length- 
wise Fold is a fold 
made lengthwise of 
the material on a warp 
thread. (Illustration 
II-2.) 
2. The Crosswise 
Fold is a fold made 
straight across the 
warp threads from 
selvedge to selvedge.

tration II-4.) Any 
lengthwise angle is a 
bias line altho not 
necessarily a true 
bias. In dressmak- 
ing this angle is 
called a “garment 
bias.” Because ma- 
terial cut on a bias 
line will stretch, it is 
desirable for bind- 
ings, pipings, trim- 
mings, etc. aN 
  Illustration II-4 
Lesson 3—Correct AND Economica Foipine or Mareriats 
1. All materials with a nap should be folded and cut with the nap 
running downward, except velvet, plush, and corduroy. The nap of 
these run upward. Panne velvet, however, should be cut with. the nap 
running downwara. 
2. Materials with a floral design should be cut with the stems running 
downward and the flowers upward. 
3. Plaids, checks, stripes, and all materials with a design should be 
folded and cut to match in the best possible manner. The predominating 
stripe or design should be folded so that it falls on the center-front and 
the center-back lines. If necessary, cut out one portion at atime. Then 
lay the top end of your 
cut -piece to the top of 
the uncut material with 
the right sides together, 
matching the design or 
nap. Then cut the cor- 
responding portion. 
4. Diagonal  mate- 
rials should be folded 
and cut so that when the 
garment is finished and 
worn the diagonal twill 
runs downward from the 
left shoulder to the right 
hand or upward from the Masta ones 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
    
American Lesson 3 | 
Dressmaking Step by Step   
  
right hand to the left 
shoulder. (lustration II- 
5.) Diagonal materials 
should not be folded or cut 
so that two bias edges will 
meet, as the lines come to- 
gether on entirely different 
angles. (Illustration II-6.) 
5. When the edge of 
the pattern is to lie on a 
fold it is generally best to 
fold the material just the 
width of the widest por- 
tion of the pattern. (Il- 
lustration II-7.) This 
usually leaves one sel- 
vedge and a part of 
one edge of the goods 
uncut. 
6. When folding 
with the grain line of 
the pattern as the 
guide, follow the old 
rule of saving the cen- 
ter, and put the two 
selvedges together, 
cutting as near the 
edge of the material 
as possible. (Illustra- 
tion II-8.)

7. When the material is too narrow for the pattern and the portion of the 
garment must be cut double, there are two ways of handling the problem. 
First—On a line where piecing will come in an inconspicuous place, 
fold the material exactly in the center, with the selvedges together. Pin 
the pattern so it will cover as much of the material as possible, and then 
piece on the remaining amount. (Illustration II-9.) 
Second—If there is sufficient material to fold crosswise with selvedges 
together, one can usually avoid piecing. (Illustration II-10.) This, 
however, can not be done with material having a nap, figure or design 
running only in one direction.

PREPARATION OF MATERIALS 
Lesson 4—SpPonGinG AND SHRINKING 
Any material which is to be pressed, using water and a hot iron, must 
be sponged and shrunk before itis made up. Practically all woolen, linen, 
and cotton materials should be carefully shrunk before they are used. 
A few open-meshed materials can not be sponged at home on account 
of the shrinkage. Voiles and many dainty fabrics can be machine 
sponged and shrunk. To acertain degree sponging and shrinking prevent 
spotting from rain, yet it is wise to try shrinking a small piece of any 
material before shrinking or sponging the entire quantity. Fine mulls, 
flowered organdies, swisses, silks, satins, velvets, etc., should not be 
shrunk, and water should not at any time be applied in pressing them. 
All materials with selvedge must either have the selvedge cut off or 
clipped at frequent intervals, otherwise the material, when it is sponged 
or pressed, is liable to draw and get very much out of shape. 
Articles Required 
The articles usually found necessary for sponging, shrinking, and 
pressing are: 
1. A Table or 
Troning-board over 
which has been 
stretched a padded 
ironing-sheet. 
2. A padded 
Sleeve-board. (Illus- 
tration IJ-11.) 
3. Two Sleeve- 
cushions, one for 
pressing the top of 
thesleeve, made with 
a cap as illustrated 
so that it can be 
slipped over the nar- 
row end of the 
sleeve-board (Illus- 
tration II-12, A), and 
one for pressing the 
bottom of the 
sleeve (Illustration 
  TI-12, B). 
4. A Tailors’ 
Cushion to use in Illustration I-12

pressing tailored garments and curved seams.  (lllustration II-13.) 
5. An Troning-sheet about a yard wide and 14% yard long. 
6. Pressing-cloths. One is 
needed for seams. It should be 
about 114 yard long and 5 inches 
wide. Another one for small 
pressing, about 12 by 12 inches, 
will be found useful. 
7. A Sponge to dampen the 
cloths in pressing. 
8. Two Flat-irons. Have 
one as large as can be handled,

size. The larger one will be used 
for tailoring and all heavy work, and the lighter one for ordinary work. 
  To Shrink Woolens 
1. Lay the material right side down, opening out the folds so that 
one thickness is pressed at a time. 
2. Wring out the ironing-sheet from cold water and lay it over the 
woolen material. 
3. Press with a hot iron, being careful that sufficient heat is applied 
to bring out all of the moisture from the material, otherwise the goods 
will not make up with its correct amount of body. The sheet should be 
wrung out three times and the shrinking process repeated three times. 
To Shrink Cotton or Linen Materials 
1. If the material is colored the color should be set before shrinking. 
Blue can be set by using one-half cupful of vinegar and one table- 
spoonful of alum to a pail of water. 
Reds, Pinks, and Blacks can be set by using two cupfuls of salt to a 
pail of water. 
Browns and Lavenders can be set with one tablespoonful of sugar of 
lead to a pail of water. 
Greens can be set with two cupfuls of salt, or one tablespoonful of 
alum to a pail of water. 
The materials must remain for several hours in the solution. 
Cotton or linen materials which have no color should be left in a tub 
of cold water from twenty minutes to one hour. 
2. Fold evenly and hang over a line to drip. 
3. As soon as the material has dripped sufficiently to allow it to be 
handled, lay it right side down on the ironing-board, and press on the

wrong side. This process should be repeated three times, otherwise the 
goods will shrink when laundered. 
To Shrink Canvas 
1. Dip the canvas in hot water to dissolve any glue which the 
material might contain. 
2. Then proceed exactly as given for shrinking cotton and linen 
materials. 
Lesson 5—Correct Mrtuops or Pressine 
1. Lay the material right side down on the ironing-board. 
2. Place the dry ironing-sheet over the material. 
3. With a wet sponge dampen the portion to be sponged or pressed. 
4. Place the iron over the dampened portion, being careful not to 
move the iron back and forth. Do not place the iron more than its dis- 
tance ahead until the material is pressed dry. Neither should the iron 
stand too long in one place as the material might become marked. 
To Press Silks and Satins 
Use an iron that is not hot enough to “siss” and press with a sheet of 
white paper between the material and the iron. No water or moisture 
is used. 
To Press Velvets and Corduroys 
Tailors press velvet and corduroy seams with their thumb, but 
women find it easier to place their thumb in the bowl of a kitchen spoon 
and press with it. 
Velvet or corduroy seams may also be steamed and pressed by placing 
a hot iron upside down in an iron-stand. Then lay a wet cloth on the 
flat-iron and draw the seam over it. 
The nap of velvet may be steamed in the same manner. 
  RULES FOR PRESSING SEAMS 
Waists 
Center-front—Press over tailors’ cushion, pressing from the waist-line 
to the neck. 
Center-back—Press over ironing-board from the waist-line to the neck. 
Side-front and Side-back Lines—Press over the tailors’ cushion, press- 
ing away from the bust and shoulder-blade line. 
Underarm Seam—Press over tailors’ cushion, pressing from the waist- 
line toward the arm-scye.

Cuffs—Press over the tailors’ cushion or the small sleeve cushion, 
pressing from the outside edge of the cuff toward the wrist. 
Skirts 
All Lines except the side lines are pressed on the ironing-board, 
pressing from the top of the skirt to the bottom. 
The Side Lines of a fitted skirt from just below the hip-line to the 
waist-line are pressed over the tailors’ cushion to give the rounding effect 
over the hips. 
Plackets are pressed over the ironing-board unless the opening is on 
the side line. In this instance it is pressed over the tailors’ cushion. All 
plackets are pressed from the bottom of the placket toward the top. 
Hems, facings, etc., are pressed on the ironing-board and pressed 
across the line of the hem, and not along it. 
To Remove Shine or Press-marks 
1. Lay the material on the ironing-board with the side upward from 
which the shine is to be removed. 
2. Lay a damp cloth over the shiny part. 
8. Place a hot iron over the damp cloth, letting the iron remain until 
the shiny spot has been well steamed. 
4. Remove the iron and cloth very quickly and brush the steam 
into the material.

CHAPTER III 
BODY MEASUREMENTS 
Lesson 6—GENERAL Instructions ror Taking MEASUREMENTS 
There are certain places on every normal woman’s body where 
each measurement starts, and where each measurement ends. The 
distance between these-two points constitutes the correct line over which 
to measure. To intelligently make the simplest garment with any degree 
‘of assurance as to a successful outcome, one must understand where 
these lines are, what constitutes them, and the exact measurement of them. 
1. The end of the tape measure where the numbering begins is held 
in the left hand. In measuring around the body the first two fingers of 
the left hand are held under the tape measure. This allows for breath 
and muscle expansion. 
2. In taking lengthwise measurements the tape measure should fall 
naturally over the line to be measured. It should not be stretched down 
nor should it be held too loosely. 
3. The model should stand correctly with both feet on the floor. 
She should not inflate her lungs, expand her chest, nor stretch her height. 
Standing on one foot or in a wearied, drooping position, or resting the 
weight on one hip changes the lines of the body, and any measurement 
taken in such a position can not be depended upon for an accurate idea 
of the correct proportions. A measurement taken in a sitting position 
differs considerably from a measurement taken in a standing position. 
4. Stand, never sit, when taking any measurement. 
5. The following measurements will give an idea of those lines 
necessary to take for garment making

The Bust Measurement 
1. Have the model stand as naturally as possible with her arms 
dropped at her sides. 
2. Stand directly back of the model. Bring the tape measure 
straight from one tip of the bust to the other. 
3. Have the model raise her arms to the level of her shoulders. Pass 
the tape measure around the body, neither too tight nor too loose. Bring 
it up under the arms 
and straight across the 
back, covering the ends 
of the shoulder-blades. 
Waist-line Measurement 
Pass the tape mea- 
sure as snugly around 
the waist-line as the belt 
is desired. 
The Shoulder Measure- 
ment 
Hold the tape mea- 
sure close to the neck 
and measure the top line 
of the shoulder from the 
neck to the end of the 
shoulder bone where the 
arm begins. 
The Chest Measurement 
Carry the tape mea- 
sure from arm socket

Mark this side-front measurement. 
2. Mark the measurements from shoulder to tip of bust and from tip 
of bust to waist-line. 
Side-back Measurement 
1. Measure from the center of the shoulder-line downward to about 
38 inches from the center-back at the waist-line. Mark this center-back 
measurement. 
2. Note the division made by the shoulder-blade line and mark the 
exact measurements from shoulder to shoulder-blade line and from shoulder- 
blade line to waist-line. 
Underarm Measurement 
1. Have the model hold herarmoutstraight ona line with her shoulder. 
2. Measure from the pit of the arm, but do not place the tape measure 
deep into the pit of the arm. Bring the tape measure downward on a 
straight line to the waist-line. 
Arm-scye Measurement 
1. Pass the tape measure snugly around the arm, close to the shoulder 
and body. 
2. Have the model move her arm forward and backward, letting the 
tape measure slip with the movement, so that the measurement will be 
large enough to permit perfect freedom in using the arm. 
3. Mark the complete arm-scye measurement. 
4. Press the tape measure upward into the pit of the arm. The 
measurement to the front of the pit of the arm belongs to the front arm- 
scye measurement. The measurement to the back of the pit of the arm 
belongs to the back arm-scye measurement. 
Arm Measurements (Illustration III-3) 
Elbow Measurement : 
When taking any measurement around the arm, the arm should be 
bent so that the thumb rests on the left breast. Measure the right arm 
over the elbow. Hold the first two fingers over the elbow bone and under 
the tape measure. 
To Measure 4 Inches Above the Elbow 
Your first two fingers should rest on the arm of the model 4 inches 
above the elbow. Carry the tape measure around the arm at this point. 
This measurement should be moderately loose. 
To Measure 4 Inches Below the Elbow 
Measure exactly the same as above, except the tape measure is carried 
4 inches below the elbow instead of 4 inches above the elbow. 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
    Body Measurements Lesson 7   
To Measure 4 Inches Below the Shoulder 
Pass the tape measure around the thickest portion of the arm, which 
is usually found about 4 inchés below the shoulder. This should also be 
a loose measurement. ai Wrist Measurement 
Hold the forefinger and middle finger against ‘the bone of the wrist. 
Measure around the line between the wrist and the hand. 
Hand Measurement 
The model should hold her thumb under her hand. Measure loosely 
é around the thumb and 
the hand. 
It is necessary to have 
the hand measure for all 
sleeves which have no 
opening or placket at the 
wrist. One must be able 
to get the hand through 
without stretching the 
bottom 
of the 
sleeve. 
Lengthwise Arm 
Measurements 
1. The arm should be 
bent so that the thumb 
rests on the left breast. 
2. Measure from the 
top of the shoulder to

division at the elbow. 
The upper measure- 
ment is the shoulder to 
elbow measurement and 
the lower one is the elbow

Neck Measurements (Illustration III-3) 
Lower Collar-line Measurement 
1. Pass the tape measure around the neck, covering the bone at the 
back of the neck and the bone at the hollow of the throat. Draw the 
tape measure as tight as is comfortable. 
2. Note the division of the neck measure from the center-front of the 
neck to the shoulder-line and from the shoulder-line to the center-back. 
Upper Collar-line Measurement 
1. Pass the tape measure close under the chin, ear, and the head at 
the back of the neck and measure as tight or as loose as desired. 
2. Note the division of this measurement from the center-front of the 
neck to the ear-line and from the ear-line to the center-hack. 
Center-front Collar Measurement 
Adjust a tape close under the chin, ear, and the head at the back of 
the neck. Measure from the top of the tape under the chin to the bone 
at the hollow of the throat at the neck-line. 
Center-back Collar Measurement 
Measure from the top of the tape to the bone at the back of the neck. 
Side Line Measurement 
Measure from the top of the tape and back of the ear downward to 
the neck at the shoulder-line. 
Skirt Measurements (Illustrations III-1 and 2) 
Hip Measurement 
Pass the tape measure around the body covering the hollow of the 
hips. Do not take this measure up over the hip joints or down over the 
thighs. The hip-line can easily be determined by standing and turning 
the toes inward. Without bending at the waist, bend at the thigh and 
the hollow becomes very apparent. 
Waist-line Measurement (See page 14) 
Thigh Measurement 
When the thighs are large in proportion to the hips, the thigh measure- 
ment should be taken and any necessary alterations should be made, 
following the same rules as for hip alterations. 
Pass the tape measure loosely around the largest part of the thighs.

Center-back Measurement 
Measure from the center-back at the waist-line to the floor. 
The Side Measure 
Measure from the waist-line, directly under the arm, downward over 
the hip to the floor. If there is a marked difference in the right and left 
hips, measure both the right and the left sides. 
Height of Hip Measure 
Measure from the waist-line downward to the hollow of the hips. 
This length from waist-line to hips

CHAPTER IV 
PATTERNS 
Lesson 9—SELECTION OF ParTERNS 
All patterns of garments covering the bust should be purchased by 
bust measure. If the bust measure of the pattern comes in alternate 
even. sizes, 36, 38, 40, etc., and one is a between size, as 35, 37, 39, 
it is usually better to choose the larger size pattern, unless the 
bust is very large in proportion to all of the other measurements which 
are covered by the pattern. (See waist pattern alterations, Lessons 
19, 20, and 23.) 
When purchasing coat or jacket patterns buy them according to bust 
size, not several sizes larger. Should one take size 36 in a tight-fitted 
garment, the loose-fitting garment should be size 36 also, as the pattern- 
makers have allowed for the extra fulness and extra size required for 
loose or full garments. 
Skirt patterns should be purchased by hip measure. 
In choosing a pattern one should consider: 
1. Its suitability for the purpose of the garment. 
2. Texture of the material. A pattern suitable for serge may not look 
well made up in chiffon cloth and vice versa. 
8. The design of the material. A pattern with many gores should 
not be chosen for plaids or materials with a design. Neither should a | 
circular skirt pattern be chosen for decided diagonal materials (Lesson 3). 
4. The width of the material. A garment which will cut without 
piecing from 52-inch material may come out badly when made from 36- 
inch material. The pattern states the widths of material on which that 
pattern can best be used. 
5. The effect of the lines of the pattern in relation to the lines of the 
body of the wearer. The following suggestions will prove helpful: 
The Straight Line 
Straight lengthwise lines increase the appearance of height. 
Straight crosswise lines increase the appearance of width. 
Angles 
The effect of an angle depends upon the degree of the angle. Its 
general effects are more moderate than a straight line or a curve. 
This is why the two- and three-piece skirts are usually so satisfactory. 
The Curved Line 
A curve tends to increase the width effect and shorten the height effect. 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
    
Lesson 9 American Dressmaking Step. by Step 22   
  
To Modify the Effects of a Line 
Unbroken lines give the appearance of height and width. By breaking 
a continuous lengthwise line with a yoke, ruffles, or draping, the general 
appearance of the wearer is shortened. By breaking the lines going 
around the body with seams, a semi-yoke, or plaits, the appearance of the 
width of the body is decreased. On this account the skirt with many 
gores is particularly becoming to the stout figure. 
The High Waist-line 
Most figures look better with at least a slightly raised waist-line. 
However, a woman who is stout and short-waisted should not choose a 
high waist-line and should always select a pattern whose lines emphasize 
her height. 
The Outside Belt 
The wider the belt the larger the appearance of the waist, and the 
narrower the belt the smaller the appearance of the waist. If a wide 
belt is desired by a woman with a large waist, it is usually best to break 
the line going around the waist by straps or buttons, or in some manner 
in vogue from time to time. If the broken line is not desired, the shape 
of the belt should be more pointed toward the center-front and back. 
The Girdle 
If a girdle is worn, the shape of the girdle as well as the width, as above 
explained, will determine its effect. A rounding girdle will increase the 
appearance of size, while a pointed girdle decreases the appearance of size. 
The Yoke 
A pointed yoke will not cut off the height to any great extent, and is 
very becoming to the large woman. It should, however, be avoided by 
the small woman, as it tends to decrease the general appearance of 
size. The round yoke will shorten the appearance of the wearer. 
Drapery 
The line and position of the drapery determine its effect. The long, 
sweeping, close-fitting folds and drapery tend to give the appearance of 
height and reduce the appearance of width, while the hip drapery or 
puffs decrease the appearance of height and increase the appearance of 
width. 
Plaits 
A few plaits always break the line of a garment and tend to increase 
the appearance of height and decrease the appearance of width. Many 
plaits in succession, however, increase the appearance of width as well 
as height.
-P-A-G-E-33
  
23 Patterns Lesson 10 
  
  
The Tunic 
The tunic is becoming to the average woman, if she chooses such lines 
as her figure demands. A study of the effects of lines will clearly indicate 
the style of tunic which should be worn. 
Ruffles 
Ruffles going around the garment decrease the appearance of the 
height and increase the appearance of width. 
Panels 
The panel and gored skirt is the friend of the large woman. However, 
a broad panel is not so becoming to very large figures, who should choose 
a reasonably narrow one to give the best effect. 
Trimming-bands 
Trimming-bands around the skirt decrease the appearance of height 
and increase the appearance of width if they are carried entirely around 
the garment. If the bands are broken at intervals, the appearance of 
width is modified. 
Lesson 10—Strupy or THe PatrerRN 
1. Identify every portion and write the name and number of the 
pattern on each part of same, as it saves any possible confusion. 
2. If the pattern is wrinkled, iron each piece. Any part not required 
put back into its envelop or lay it aside. 
8. Study each mark and perforation until thoroughly familiar with 
its purpose. 
4. The following suggestions will give an idea of the main points for 
which to look: 
(A). Seam Margins are found by a line of perforations, or by notches, 
or the width of the seam is stated on the pattern. 
If a seam is desired and no margin has been left, always cut far enough 
outside of the edge of the pattern to make provision for seam joinings. 
For instance, if a portion of the pattern is shown to be cut on a fold of 
the material and the material is not wide enough, a seam must be allowed. 
(Illustration II-10, Lesson 3.) 
If a seam margin has been left on the centers of a pattern and no seam 
is desired, fold back the seam margin before laying on to the material. 
(B). Hems and Facings. If directed to either hem or face the gar- 
ment decide which is preferred. If facing is desired, no other provision 
other than the correct length and 3¢ of an inch for the seam joining of 
the facing is necessary. 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
    
  
  Lessons 11, 12,13 American Dressmaking Step by Step px 
  
If a hem is desired and the pattern does not allow for same, make the 
hem allowance on the material, not on the pattern. 
When the pattern states the garment is to be faced, do not attempt 
to hem it, as the pattern probably has been drafted on lines which will not 
turn well for a hem. 
(C). Cutting and Trimming Lines. Study the cutting and trim- 
ming perforations and then cut exactly on the line which the instruc- 
tions have given. 
Lesson 11—Patrrern MrAsuREMENTS 
The commercial paper pattern is constructed according to model 
measurements. Unless the persons using the patterns are perfect models, 
they should change the patterns to their own proportions, lines, measure- 
ments, and individual requirements. In order to do this, not only must 
the body measurements be ascertained as in Chapter III, but the meas- 
urements of the model patterns as well. 
In studying body measurements (Chapter III) one learns that the 
distance between certain points of the body constitutes a given line. 
There are corresponding points on the pattern constituting the same 
lines measured on the body. 
Lesson 12—To Preparer Tue Parrern TO BE MrasurED 
(A). Identify every portion of the pattern as taught in Lesson 10, 
and mark all margins and seam outlets. Measure only between the marked 
margins and marked seam outlets. 
(B). Place the pattern flat on the table matching all notches. (Illus- 
trations IV-1, 2, and 3.) 
(C). Mark and measure the lines of the pattern, proceeding in the 
following manner: 
Lesson 13—Waist MEASUREMENTS 
To Mark the Bust-line (Illustration TV-1) 
1. Begin at the tip of the bust on the side line. The tip of the bust 
is located at the top of the front dart, or, if there are no darts, it is found 
at the most curved portion of the side-front line (A). Mark straight 
across the center-front portion of the pattern to the center-front line. 
2. Carry this line from the tip of the bust to the shoulder-blade line. 
‘The shoulder-blade line passes through the rounding curve of the side- 
back line. 
3. Carry the shoulder-blade line straight across the center-back 
portion to the center-back line. 
This makes the dividing line of the entire pattern.

The Bust Measure 
Bust lines are not measured. The pattern-makers’ word must be 
accepted that the 
pattern has been 
drafted for the size 
bust that has been 
marked forit. There 
are, however, but 
few garments which 
have exactly the 
same bust measure 
as the wearer, as an 
allowance for ease 
and fulness is 
usually made on 
the pattern for the 
garment. 
To Mark the Waist- 
_ line 
The pattern is 
either notched or 
has perforations at 
the waist-line, or it 
may mark the waist-line at no point except under the arm. If the gar- 
ment comes into a belt at the waist-line, often only 3 of an inch margin 
is allowed below the waist-line.   
  Illustration IV-1 
Waist-line Measure 
The pattern-makers usually state the waist measure of their patterns. 
If not stated, deduct ten inches from the bust measure stated on the 
pattern and this is approximately the waist measure. All pattern-makers 
will give either exact or approximate measures of bust, waist, and hips. 
To Mark the Shoulder-line 
Mark the back shoulder seam from neck outlet to arm-scye outlet. 
Shoulder Measurement 
Measure the marked shoulder seam from outlet to outlet. 
To Mark the Chest-line 
Keep the center-fronts straight. Mark a straight line across the 
pattern midway between the front shoulder seam and the curve leading 
to the underarm.

Lesson 13 American Dressmaking Step by Step 26 
Chest Measurement 
Measure the chest-line from center-fronts to arm-scye outlets. 
To Mark the Across Back Line 
Carry a straight line across the pattern, midway between the back 
shoulder seam and the curve leading to the underarm. 
Across Back Measurement 
Measure from the center-back to the margin of the arm-scyes. 
Center-front Measurements 
1. Measure from the margin of the neck-line down the center-front 
of the pattern to the waist-line. 
2. Note the division at the bust-line. The upper measurement con- 
stitutes the Neck to Bust-line Measurement (B). The lower measure- 
ment is the Bust-line to Waist-line Measurement (C). 
Center-back Measurements 
1. Measure from the neck margin down the center-back of the pat- 
tern to the waist-line. 
2. Note the division at the shoulder-blade line. The upper measure- 
ment constitutes the Neck to Shoulder-blade Line Measurement (D). The 
lower measurement is the Shoulder-blade Line to Waist-line Measure- 
ment (FE). 
Side-front Measurements . 
1. Measure from the center of the shoulder seam, bringing the tape 
measure downward over the side line to the tip of the bust and to the 
waist-line. 
2. Note the division at the tip of the bust. The upper measurement 
constitutes the Shoulder to Tip of Bust Measurement (F). The lower 
measurement is the Tip of Bust to Waist-line Measurement (G). 
Side-back Measurement 
1. Measure from the center of the shoulder-line, bringing the tape 
measure downward over the side-line to the waist-line. 
2. Note the division at the shoulder-blade line. The upper measure- 
ment constitutes the Shoulder to Shoulder-blade Line (H), and the lower 
measurement is the Shoulder-blade Line to Waist-line (side measure- 
ment) (I). 
The Underarm Measurement 
Measure the underarm seam from the arm-scye margin to the 
waist-line (J).

outlets. 
For the flat or roll collar, the neck line only is measured. 
  Lesson 16—Sxirt M&ASUREMENTS 
A skirt pattern is not measured but its proportions are found in the 
following manner: 
1. The Hip Measure is stated on the pattern. 
2. The Waist Measure is stated on the pattern. 
3. The Front Measure is stated on the pattern. 
4. The Side Measure is found by adding one inch to the given front 
measure unless otherwise stated on the pattern. This rule applies to 
practically all patterns between 40 and 57 inches hip measure. In 
patterns under this size a shorter length is usually made. 
5. The Back Measure is found by adding one inch to the given front 
measure unless otherwise stated on the pattern. 
6. Waist to Hip Length is stated on the pattern.

Lesson 18—SpkciFicaTIONS FOR Frrrine 
To Figure the Specifications for Fitting Patterns 
1. Obtain the body measurements (Chapter IIT). 
2. Obtain the pattern measurements (Lessons 11 to 17). 
3. The difference between the measurements of the body and the 
size of the pattern constitutes the specifications of the amount to be fitted. 
In figuring the lengths of loose waists an extra allowance has usually 
been made by the pattern-makers for blouse. Below is given the form 
usually used in obtaining the Specifications for Fitting.

The entire method is simply a process of adding or subtracting the 
difference between the measurements which have been obtained. 
Sleeves and collars are figured in exactly the same manner. 
Skirt alterations are figured from the desired length instead of the 
floor length. For instance: should one measure 44 inches to the floor 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
    
Lessons 19, 20 American Dressmaking Step by Step 32   
  
for the front measure and wish the skirt to hang 7 inches from the floor, 
a skirt $7 inches in length is figured. If the pattern is drafted 41 inches 
finished length, a 3-inch alteration is required.

Lesson 19—PatTERN ALTERATIONS 
The pattern should always be fitted to the figure before the garment 
is cut out. This means economy of time, labor, and materials. One 
is then also assured a perfect fitting garment before the material has been 
cut into. 
1. Study carefully the list of specifications of measurements to be 
obtained. Learn just what constitutes each of the specific lines on the 
body, where to find, and how to measure over each of them. This is 
fully covered in Chapter IIT. 
2. Measure these same lines on the pattern (Lesson 12) or refer 
to the table of Pattern Measurements (Lesson 17). 
8. Obtain the specifications for any alterations to be made (Lesson 
18). 
4. The following lesson teaches how and where to make necessary 
alterations on the pattern. 
Lesson 20—To Atrer Patterns For Firrep GARMENTS 
(Such as linings, waists, tailored coats, Princess slips, brassieres, etc.) 
When the Pattern Is Too Large or Too Small (Illustration IV-4) 
The alteration for bust size is made only on the side-front, and side- 
back lines of the pattern. 
1. Learn the exact amount of alteration required to enlarge or 
reduce the bust measure of the pattern to fit the figure. 
2. Divide the number of inches of the alteration by the number 
of edges to be altered. This will give the correct proportion of extension 
or reduction to make on each edge of the seams. For instance: should 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  33 Patterns Lesson 20   
  
one wish to enlarge or reduce the bust measure two inches on the pattern, 
extend or fold back the edges of each side-front and side-back line 
14 of an inch, as there 
are eight edges upon 
which to make altera- 
tions. (Illustration 
IV-4.) 
The extension or 
fold of the pattern 
is made a uniform 
amount the entire 
length of the side- 
lines. 
This bust size is 
always adjusted be- 
fore any other portion 
of the pattern is 
measured. 
If the Waist-line Is 
Too Largeor Too Small 
Start at the waist- 
line and extend or 
fold back the pattern on the underarm seams one-fourth of the amount 
necessary to enlarge or reduce the waist-line, graduating the alteration to 
the bust-line. (Illustration IV-4.) 
  Illustration IV-4 
If the Pattern Is Too Wide or Too Narrow on the Shoulder and Is Just 
Right Across the Chest 
The shoulder seam will be lengthened or shortened at the arm-scye. 
(Illustration IV-4.) 
If the Pattern Is Too Wide or Too Narrow on Both Shoulder and Chest 
The alteration is made by extending or folding the pattern from the 
shoulder to the tip of the bust-line. Do not alter the front shoulder-line 
only, as the back shoulder-line must be altered a corresponding amount, 
altho the chest-line and the across back lines are altered independently 
of each other. 
If the Pattern Is Too Wide or Too Narrow on the Across Back Line and 
the Shoulders 
Alter on the side-back lines from shoulder to shoulder-blade line by 
extending or folding back the pattern. 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-44
    
  Lesson 20 American Dressmaking Step by Step 34   
If the Pattern Is Too Long or Too Short from Neck to Bust-line 
Fold back or extend the pattern the correct amount at the chest-line 
(Illustration IV-5), graduating the alteration to the side-front line. 
If the Pattern Is Too Long or Too Short from Shoulder 
to Tip of Bust 
Fold back or extend the pattern the necessary amount on the chest- 
line, graduating the 
alteration to the cen- 
ter-front and to the 
arm-scye. 
If the Front Arm- 
scye Is Too Large 
or Too Small 
Fold back or ex- 
tend the pattern on 
the chest-line, grad- 
uating the alteration 
to the side-front line. 
If the Pattern Is Too 
Long or Too Short 
from Neck to Shoul-

Extend or shorten 
the pattern on the Illustration 1V-5

(Illustration IV-5), graduating the alteration to the side-back line. 
  If the Pattern Is Too Long or Too Short from Shoulder to 
Shoulder-blade Line 
Shorten or extend the pattern on the Across Back Line, graduating 
the alteration to the back arm-scye and to the center-back line. 
If the Pattern Is Too Large or Too Small in the Back Arm-scye 
Enlarge or reduce on the Across Back Line by folding back or 
extending the pattern the necessary amount, and graduate the alter- 
ation to the side-back line.

If the Pattern Is Too Long or Too Short-waisted from Bust-line to W aist-line, 
or from Tip of Bust to Waist-line, or from Shoulder-blade Line to 
Waist-line, or Under the Arm, or for Any Lengthwise 
Alteration Below the Bust and Shoulder-blade Line 
The pattern is lengthened or shortened 114 inch above the natural 
waist-line, being careful that every alteration is graduated to the 
next alteration point, keeping each mea- 
surement perfect. Only the exact amount 
necessary is taken from or added to each 
line. For instance, if the center-back 
line measures the correct amount, no 
reduction or addition is made to the length 
of that line. If the wnderarm seam line 
needs 14 inch more length and center-front 
line needs 114 inch more length, add those 
quantities to their respective lines without 
altering the center-back line. (Illustration 
IV-5.) 
Lesson 21—To Aurer ror Rounp SHout- 
DERS OR PROTRUDING SHOULDER-BLADES 
This alteration is made on the shoulder- 
blade line at the side-back line of the pat- 
tern. Graduate the alteration to the center- 
back line and to the underarm seam. [E 
(Illustration IV-6.) Illustration IV-6 
  Lesson 22—For Very Srraicut SHounpers or Recepine 
SHOULDER-BLADES 
Alter on the same lines as for round shoulders, reducing instead of 
increasing the length. 
Lesson 23—Loosr Waist ALTERATIONS 
Loose Waists are altered the same as fitted waists. When it has no 
side seams upon which to alter, slash the pattern from the center of the 
shoulder to the waist-line and spread or fold the pattern according to 
instructions given in Lesson 20. However, it must be kept in mind that 
these alterations are for the correct proportions only and should not be 
brought down to the actual measurements of the body. For instance, 
a 36 bust size may measure 46 inches around the bust because of 10 extra 
inches allowed for fulness and ease. If the woman for whom the garment 
is made measures a 36-inch bust, the pattern requires no alteration.

Lesson 24 American Dressmaking Step by Step 36 
  
Lesson 24—ALTERATION OF SLEEVE PATTERN 
Sleeves should not be cut out until the body portion of the garment 
has been fitted, and the seams finished. The reason is very obvious. 
Suppose the shoulder seam of a garment is taken up a certain amount; 
unless a corresponding amount is taken out of the sleeve, the sleeve will 
be too full at the top. Again, suppose the garment was lengthened on 
the chest-line and the sleeve is plain. If no corresponding alteration is 
made on the front of it, this sleeve will not be large enough to reach 
from the shoulder seam to the correct place under the arm, and a 
good fit could not be expected. Therefore, every alteration made in 
arm-scye, shoulder, or underarm seams of the garment or pattern must 
have a corresponding alteration in the same place, the same manner, 
and the same amount on the pattern of the sleeve. 
Sleeves must be fitted the exact length desired, and so that they fit 
at the arm-scye, elbow, four inches above the elbow, four inches below 
the elbow, and at the wrist. Should the sleeves be closed at the wrist, 
the bottom of the sleeves is fitted according to the hand measurement. 
If the sleeves are open at the wrist with a placket, cuff, or fulness, to 
allow the hand to pass through, then the wrist measurement is used. 
ALTERATION FOR ARM-SCYE OF SLEEVE PATTERN 
In altering the arm-scye of the garment there are four different lines 
on which to alter, viz.: 
1. Shoulder alteration, made on the 
shoulder seam. 
2. Underarm alteration, made on the 
underarm seams. 
8. Front arm-scye alteration, made on 
the chest-line, 
4. Back arm-scye alteration, made on the 
across back line. 
The corresponding places are to be altered 
on the sleeves a corresponding amount and in 
exactly the same manner. By altering ac- 
cording to this method it is found that no 
matter how many alterations are made in the 
arm-scye of the garment, or on the pattern of 
the garment, one is able to match the top of 
the sleeves at the correct place and bring the 
underarm seam to the right line, and keep the 
amount of fulness in the sleeve which it is 
Tllustration TV-7 intended to have.

If the Shoulder Seam Has Been Altered (Illustrations IV-7 and 8) 
Slash the sleeve pattern at the top of the sleeve and alter the same 
amount added or taken from 
the shoulder seam, graduating 
the alteration to four inches 
above the elbow. When 
a slash has been made in the 
pattern the alteration should 
continue until the pattern lies 
flat or else allowance made 
for the curve of the pattern. 
If the Front Arm-scye of the 
Garment Has Been Altered

Lesson 25—To Aurer tun OnE-Pince SLEEVE 
(Illustrations IV-18 and 19) 
The one-piece sleeve is altered the same as the two-piece sleeve 
(Lesson 24), except that, since it has no back seam, the alterations ordi- 
narily falling on this seam are made by slashing the pattern toward the 
center of the sleeve, starting about 4 inches from the underarm of the 
pattern. 
Lesson 26—To Aurmr Kimono AND RaGLaNn SLEEVES 
The Kimono and Raglan Sleeves have no arm-scye altho sometimes 
they have a shoulder seam. Therefore, none of the alterations given in 
Lesson 24, other than the shoulder alteration, are required for the top 
portion of the sleeve. , 
The width and length alterations are made the same as on all other 
sleeves. 
Lesson 27—SprEctaL SLEEVE ALTERATIONS 
To Alter for Fleshy Muscle of the Arm 
Many women find that sleeves fit perfectly in the arm-scye, but are 
altogether too small through the muscle of the arm. 
First of all, consider where the fleshy part of the arm seems to be, 
whether it comes to the front of the arm or the back, or whether the 
flesh seems to be evenly distributed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
      
41 Patterns Lesson 28   
  
1. If the flesh of the arm seems 
evenly distributed (Illustration IV- 
20), start the alteration with 
nothing at the top of the seams of 
the sleeves, carrying the alteration 
downward, graduating to one- 
fourth of the amount necessary as 
the alteration reaches the line 4 
inches below the shoulder. Make 
this adjustment on both the front 
and back seams. 
2. If the flesh of the arm seems 
to be mostly at the front of the arm, 
then make the entire alteration 
only on the front portion of the 
sleeve, leaving the back portion as 
itis. 
3. If the flesh of the arm seems 
to be mostly on the back part of the 
arm, alter only on the back seam of 
the sleeves, altering an equal amount on both the upper portion and the 
under portion of the sleeve seams. 
  Tllustration IV-20 
To Alter for a Fleshy Forearm 
Alter practically the same as for a fleshy muscle. 
1. Alter the sleeve on both the upper and lower portions of the 
front and back seams if the flesh is evenly distributed. 
2. Alter only on the front seams if the flesh seems to be to the 
front. 
8. Alter on the back seams if the flesh seems to be to the back 
of the forearm. 
To alter for thin muscles, or a thin forearm, reduce the amount in the 
same places as enlarged for the fleshy muscle or fleshy forearm. 
Lesson 28—-To Aurer Curr Patrerns 
Cuff alterations are made to correspond to the alterations which 
are made at the bottom of the sleeves. If the seams at the bottom 
of the sleeves have been taken in or let out, the cuff pattern should 
be taken in or let out the same amount and on the same lines, unless it 
interferes with a point of the cuff. In the latter instance the alteration 
is made at each side of the points of the cuff.

Lesson 29—ALTERATION OF 
Cotiar ParrerNs 
Collar alterations are studied 
in two classes. ‘The High, Close- 
fitting Collar, and the Roll, Flare, 
or Flat Collar. To have the collar 
fit one’s neck is more or less of an 
individual problem, for unless it is 
fitted according to the individual 
requirements there is usually 
some trouble in wearing it. 
To Alter a High Collar Pattern 
1. If a collar is too large or 
too small, divide the amount of 
the alteration in half. Set in a 
piece to enlarge, or lay in a fold to 
reduce at the center-front and on 
each end of the collar. This keeps 
the collar in perfect shape. (Tllus- 
trations IV-21 and 22.) 
2. If the collar is too large or 
too small from center-front to side 
line and just right from the side 
line to the center-back, make all 
alterations on the center-front of 
the collar, making none on the 
ends of the collar. (Illustrations 
IV-23 and 24.) 
8. If the collar is just right 
from the center-front to side line, 
and too large or too small from side 
line to center-back, make the alter- 
ation only at the ends of the col- 
lar, and none in the center-front. 
(Illustrations IV-25 and 26.) 
4. If the collar is the right 
size at the lower line, but is too 
large or too small at the upper line, 
alter on the side-front and side- 
back lines of the collar, graduat- 
ing thealteration from theamount 
necessary to alter at the top down,       Illustration TV-26
-P-A-G-E-53
  43 Patterns Lesson 29 
to nothing at the bottom. — (Illus- 
trations IV-27 and 28.) 
5. Ifacollar fits at the upper 
line, but is too large or too small at 
the lower line, reverse the process, 
making the alterations on the side- 
front and side-back lines, but al- 
tering from the bottom of the col- 
lar, graduating to nothing at the 
top. (Illustrations [V-29 and 30.) 
6. If acollar is too high or too 
low, make the alteration to height- 
en or lower on a straight line 
through the center of the collar, 
never on the edges. (Illustrations 
IV-31 and 32.) 
7. Ifa collar is too high or too 
low in the back, and just the right 
height in front, graduate the al- 
teration from center-back to noth- 
ing at the front. (HMlustrations 
IV-33 and 34.) 
8. Ifthe collar is right at the 
back and too high or too low in 
front, place the amount of the al- 
teration in the center-front of the 
collar and graduate to nothing at 
the ends. (Illustrations TV-35 
and 36.)   
  
To Alter the Flat or Roll Collar 
(Illustrations [V-37 and 38) 
The Flat or Roll Collar is a 
very easy portion of the garment 
to alter, as no alterations are made 
on the center-front or center-back. 
The only alterations necessary 
are the same as in the neck and 
shoulder of the garment, making 
the alterations in the correspond- 
ing place and amount. 
1. Tf analteration is made in 
the neck of the garment, the same Illustration IV-33     
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  Lesson 30 American Dressmaking Step by Step j 44   
  
  
alteration should also be made in 
the corresponding place at the 
neck of the collar pattern. 
2. Tf an alteration is made in 
both the neck and the shoulder of 
the garment, corresponding alter- 
ations should be made in the neck 
and shoulder of the collar pattern. 
8. If analteration is made in 
the shoulder only of the garment, 
a corresponding alteration is 
made on the outside edge of the 
collar, not changing the neck-line 
of the collar pattern. 
Care must be taken not to al- 
ter through the point of a collar. 
If the alteration falls there, make 
it either to the front or the back of 
the point.

Lesson 30—ALTERATION OF Skirt Patterns (Illustration [V-39) 
The Straight Skirt 
The Straight Skirt has straight lines from the top to the bottom, and 
has neither waist-line nor hip-line. 
The width of the skirt depends on the number of breadths used. 
The straight skirt is adjusted at the waist-line by tucks, gathers,
-P-A-G-E-55
    
45 Patterns Lesson 30 
  
  
shirring, plaits, cord- 
ings, or any method 
in vogue. 
In cutting a 
straight skirt without 
a pattern it requires 
a greater length than 
simply the desired 
length of the finished 
skirt. In order to 
have the skirt hang 
evenly, the following 
allowances must be 
made: 
1. Allow 3 of an 
inch margin for the 
top of the skirt. 
2. Allow double Illustration IV-38 
  the amount of a heading or ruffle if a heading or ruffle is desired. 
8. Allow the number of inches which the skirt is to be raised above 
the natural waist-line. 
4.- Allow the length of the skirt to the finished back measure, or to 
the longest point of the finished skirt. 
42-inch back, do not 
cut the skirt to the 
41-inch length and 
have it too short in 
the back, but rather 
cut it to the 42-inch 
length, and turn the 
skirt up at the bot- 
tom to the desired 
length. 
5. Allow 1% of 
an inch for each 
time the garment is 
adjusted around the 
body. For instance, 
if there are three 
rows of shirrings 
around the body, 
allow 14% an inch 
for each row of Illustration IV-39 Tf one desire a 41-inch front, and 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-56
    
Lesson 30 American Dressmaking Step by Step 46   
  
shirring, making the garment 114 inch longer than the required measure- 
ment. In this way one eliminates the drawing up at the hips and back, 
making the skirt shorter than it was intended to be. 
6. If a hem is desired, allow its width. 
7. Allow 3 of an inch for the lower margin. 
To Alter the Straight Skirt 
Any alteration in length of the straight skirt is made at the bottom 
unless of bordered material, or flouncing, when the alterations must 
necessarily be at the top instead of at the bottom. 
  Illustration TV-40 
Altering the Piece Skirt 
The Piece Skirt has only the side line on which to alter. Do not alter 
on the center-front or center-back lines to enlarge or reduce the pattern. 
1. Mark the regulation waist-line. The pattern-makers will state 
or show this plainly on their patterns. If they do not, measure the width 
of the belt pattern which accompanies the skirt pattern and this will 
give the height of the waist-line. 
2. Measure the number of inches below the natural waist-line to which 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  
  
47 Patterns Lesson 30   
  
the pattern-makers state they have drafted the hip measure. Mark 
this hip-line entirely around the pattern, as it will be the line to and 
from which to make the alterations on both a Piece and a Gored Skirt. 
If the Hip Measure of the Pattern Is Too Small (Illustration TV-40) 
Extend the pattern one-quarter of the amount of the required 
alteration, carrying the extension a uniform amount from the hip-line to 
the bottom of the skirt and graduate alteration to correct waist-line. 
  Illustration TV-41 
If the Hip Measure Is Too Large (Illustration TV-41) 
Fold the pattern a uniform width of one-quarter of the necessary 
alteration, folding back from the hip-line to the bottom of the skirt and 
graduate the alteration to the waist-line. 
If the Waist Measure Is Just Right and the Hips Are To Be Enlarged or 
Reduced (Illustrations IV-40 and 41) 
Make no alteration at the waist-line, but begin at the hips and fold 
back or extend the pattern, graduating the line to nothing as it 
approaches the waist-line.

To Enlarge the Waist Measure 
(Illustrations [V-42 and 43) 
1. Enlarge the pattern 
at the waist-line at the side 
line of the skirt, extending 
one-fourth of the amount 
necessary for the entire en- 
largement of the waist-line. 
Enlarge on both the front 
(illustration IV-42) and 
back lines (Illustration 
IV-43). 
2. Graduate the altera- 
tion from the top line of the 
skirt through the extension 
at the waist-line to the hip- 
line. It is obvious that 
one can alter only when 
the side line is an angle.

entire reduction. It is 
essential that an equal 
amount be. taken from 
both the front (Illus-

  49 Patterns Lesson 30   
  
To Alter a Gored Skirt Pattern (Illustrations IV-46 and 47) 
A gored skirt pattern is very 
easy to alter and its greater num- 
ber of seams makes it a desirable 
skirt for women whose figure 
requirements demand a number 
of alterations. 
Do not alter the center-front 
or the center-back line of a gored 
skirt pattern. Do not alter on 
any straight line, but make the 
alterations only on the angles. 
The rule for gored skirt alter- 
ations is as follows: 
Divide the number of inches 
of the required alteration by the 
number of angles upon which to 
alter. Every seam has two edges, 
therefore there are twice the 
number of places as there are 
alteration seams, 
All reductions and_ enlarge- 
ments of the gored skirt 
pattern are made exactly 
as taught in detail in the 
Piece Skirt alterations. 
  To Fit a Circular Skirt 
Pattern When Both Hips 
and Waist-line Are an 
Equal Amount Too Small

1. Lay the pattern on 
a long. straight strip of 
paper.

lines. Since the pat- 
tern is usually one-

four alteration places.

  To Fit the Circular Skirt Pattern When the Waist Measure Is Correct and 
the Hip Measure Is Too Large (Illustration TV-48) 
The pattern must be altered to the exact hip measure without regard 
to the change which it makes on the waist-line. 
1. Fold back the pattern one-fourth of the amount of the necessary 
alteration, making the : : 
fold a uniform amount 
from top to bottom 
of the center-front and 
center-back lines of the 
pattern. This reduces 
the waist size the same 
amount which it reduces 
the hips. 
2. Enlarge the waist 
to its required size by 
slashing from the top of 
the pattern to the hip- 
line on the side-front and 
side-back lines and ex- 
tending the pattern on 
the waist-line at each 
slash one-fourth of the Illustration IV-49

Lesson 30 American Dressmaking Step by Step “52 
amount of the entire waist alteration. Graduate the alteration to nothing 
at the hip-line. : 
The above alteration will show how necessary it is to purchase a cir- 
cular skirt pattern by hip measure, for when the hip size is not correct it 
means a general alteration of the entire pattern. 
To Fit a Cireular Skirt Pattern When the Hips Are Too Small and the 
Waist-line the Right Size (Illustration IV-49) 
The first requirement of every skirt pattern is that the hips be the 
right size. If the hips of a circular skirt pattern are too small, first enlarge 
the pattern to the correct hip measure, regardless of the change which 
this will make on the waist-line. 
1. Lay the pattern on a long, straight strip of paper and make an 
extension of one-fourth of the amount to be altered, carrying the extension 
a uniform width from top to bottom on both the front and back lines. 
This naturally enlarges the waist-line the same amount the hips are 
enlarged. 
2. Reduce the waist measure to the correct size by slashing from the 
top of the pattern to the hip-line on the side-front and side-back lines 
and lapping the pattern at the waist-line at each slash one-fourth of 
the amount of the entire alteration. Graduate the alteration to nothing 
at the hip-line. 
TO ALTER SKIRT LENGTHS 
To Lengthen from Waist-line to Hip 
1. If the pattern is too short from the natural waist-line to the hips, 
lengthen the pattern by slashing it half-way between the regulation 
waist-line and the hip-line, slashing the pattern straight across the entire 
width. Do not make the slash in a curve, or try to follow the top line 
of the skirt, otherwise it will be very difficult to keep the correct lines. 
2. Spread the pattern the exact amount which must be added to 
get. the correct length from waist-line to hips. 
3. In making the alteration and inserting the extra piece, add to 
the outside line of the alteration, as there will be one edge a little wider 
than the other when the alteration is made, and the perfect lengthwise 
line must be maintained. 
To Shorten the Pattern from the Waist-line to the Hips 
1. Slash the pattern as advised for lengthening it. 
2. Lap the pattern the exact amount it is to be shortened.

2. Spread or lap 
the pattern one-half of 
the amount necessary 
at each of the slashes, 
graduating the length 
to any required 
amount. 
3. Even up the 
outside edges of the 
pattern, as the spread- 
ing or lapping always 
changes the edges of an 
angle and the correct 
lines must be retained. To Lengthen the Skirt from the Hips 
to the Bottom 
In lengthening the skirt, where 
one needs only one inch additional, 
lengthen it at the very bottom of 
the skirt. If there is over one inch to 
add, it should not be added at the 
bottom of the skirt, as it is apt to 
change the line. 
To Lengthen or Shorten Skirt Patterns 
(Illustrations [V-50 and 51)

across the entire skirt four inches

  If several inches are to be 
taken from the length of the pat- 
tern it is best to alter in a third 
place also, taking off one-third of 
the amount necessary half-way 
from the hips to the bottom of 
the skirt and one-third in each 
of the other alteration places. 
In this way the entire lower 
sweep of the skirt is preserved.

Lesson 31—ALTERATION FoR THE LarGr ABDOMEN (Illustration IV-52) 
Sometimes it is found when the measurement is taken, that the skirt 
length is from one to two or three inches shorter in front than at the back 
because of a large abdomen. 
An alteration should then be made to allow width as well as length, 
so the side seams will not draw forward. 
To Alter a Skirt for a Large Abdomen 
1. Ascertain the 
exact difference be- 
tween the front and 
back measurements of 
the model. The back 
measure is ordinarily 
1 inch longer than 
the front measure. 
2. For alteration 
purposes use a 
straight strip of paper 
about 4 inches longer 
than the front length 
of the skirt and about 
6 inches wide. 
3. Pin the bot- 
tom edge of the cen- 
ter-front of the skirt 
onto the © straight 
lower edge of the 
alteration strip at (A). 
Mark downward on 
the pattern from the 
natural waist-line the 
point of the fullest 
part of the abdomen 
(B). Pin this mark 
back from the straight 
edge of the alteration 
strip one-half of the 
distance of the entire 
amount of the altera- 
tion. Should one be   enlarging 2 inches Illustration IV-52

Lessons 32, 33 =» American Dressmaking Step by Step 56     
  
for the abdomen, pin the pattern back 1 inch from the edge of the 
alteration strip. 
4. Carry the alteration line upward above the top of the pattern (C) 
the same amount which is added to the front of- the garment for the 
abdominal alteration. 
5. Graduate the line from the center-front and top of the pattern to 
nothing at the center-back line (D). 
6. Change the perforations or marks indicating the natural waist- 
line so the pattern will preserve the original width above the natural 
waist-line. 
7. After the abdominal alterations have been made, the waist and 
hips are then adjusted according to Lesson 30. 
When one has a very large abdomen it is usually advisable in making 
a panel skirt to leave the panel wide enough so that it can be adjusted 
over the abdomen, and all seams kept in their correct line. 
Lesson 32—Axrertnc Misses’, Girus’, Juniors’, AND CHILDREN’S 
PATTERNS 
Misses’, girls’, juniors’, and children’s patterns are altered on exactly 
the same principle as ladies’ patterns. Naturally, it is not necessary 
to secure so many measurements and the work is somewhat simplified. 
Instead of altering with the bust-line as the dividing line, the breast- 
line is used. 
Instead of altering the lengths from the floor for girls’ and children’s 
garments, they are altered to and from the knee. 
A careful study and adherence of the directions for making alterations 
on ladies’ garments will answer every need. 
Lesson 83—A.rtERING Boys’ ParrerNs 
Boys’ blouse and coat patterns are altered on the same principle as 
ladies’ garments, using the breast-line instead of the bust-line for the 
dividing line of the pattern. 
ALTERING BOYS’ PANTS PATTERNS 
It is usually far better to make up a pair of pants for a boy out 
of an old piece of muslin or some cheap material before making up the 
garment. Boys’ measurements differ radically, as they may be very 
full across the seat and flat across the abdomen, or they may be very 
full in the abdomen and flat across the seat. 
And then, a boy may be very long from waist to crotch and short 
from crotch to knee, or vice versa. 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-67
    
57 Patterns Lesson 33 
  
The age of a boy does not necessarily determine the size of the pattern 
which he requires. Therefore, to first make the alterations on an old 
piece of material will insure a much better fitting garment.

Large or Too Small

one-fourth of the entire amount of 
the alteration on each of the side 
seams, graduating the line down about 
four or five inches. 
If the Pattern Is Too Wide or Too 
Narrow Across the Seat 
This alteration is also made on 
the side lines, either extending the 
line on each seam one-fourth of the 
amount needed to enlarge, or folding 
the pattern back one-fourth of the 
amount needed to reduce.

CHAPTER V 
CUTTING 
Lesson 34—LayING THE PATTERN ON THE MATERIAL 
FOR CUTTING 
1. Patterns of garments without a shoulder seam, especially night- 
gowns, on account of the length, sometimes come in two pieces, and the 
pattern must be joined at the shoulder before laying it on the material. 
Sew or pin the pattern together, matching the shoulder marks or per- 
forations. 
2. Fold the material correctly and economically as directed in 
Lesson 3. 
8. Place the pattern on the material, pinning either the fold or the 
grain line of the pattern (whichever appears on that portion of it) to the 
material. The fold line is pinned to the fold of the material, or the grain 
line laid on a straight warp thread of the material. 
4. Then smooth the pattern in all directions and pin the edges. 
If the grain line has been laid on the perfect straight of the material, the 
grain line perforations of the pattern will measure an equal distance 
from the selvedge. 
5. Put in the tailors’ tacks. Mark the large perforations with 
one color of thread, the small ones with another, and the slots with 
a third color. 
To Make Tailors’ Tacks 
(Illustration V-1) 
A. Thread a_ needle’ with a 
double thread, but do not knot it. 
B. Take a straight — stitch 
through a perforation and both 
thicknesses of the material. 
C. Draw the thread through, 
leaving an end at least 1 inch 
long. 
D. Place the needle again 
through the same perforation in the 
same manner as in Step B. 
E. Draw the thread through, 
leaving a l-inch loop. Cut the 
thread 1 inch from the loop. 
F. Proceed to the next perfora- _ 
tion in the same manner. Illustration V-1 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
    
59 Cutting Lesson 35) 
  
G. In sheer materials repeat this process, making two loops, as one 
loop does not always stay in. 
6. Run a colored thread with basting-stitches down any fold 
marking a center line. 
Lesson 35—GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FoR CUTTING 
Attention to the following details will assist in learning to cut correctly. 
1. Use a pair of large, sharp cutting shears. Keep the broad part 
of the shears flat on the table. Cut only with the center of the shears 
until at the end of the line or curve of the pattern. It is dull scissors, 
used at their points, which cause much of the haggled appearance in cutting. 
2. Keep the material flat on the table. 
3. Cut close to the edge of the pattern. 
4. Cut each notch just enough so it can be distinguished, or mark 
the place of the notch with tailors’ tacks. 
5. Remove pins. 
6. Before removing the pattern, pull the two thicknesses of material 
apart very gently, and clip the tailors’ tacks. 
7. Remove the pattern. 
The garment is then ready to be constructed.

CHAPTER VI 
FASTENINGS AND STITCHES 
Lesson 36—FAstTENINGS 
In all work a fastening stitch is required. A knot at the end of the 
thread is used for a fastening in basting. 
In hemming, fasten the thread with two or three back stitches taken 
under the fold of the hem. Do not catch the stitches through to the right 
side of the garment. 
In work where there is no fold under which to hide the fastening, the 
same stitch used in continuing the work is taken over two or three times. 
For instance: if the running stitch is to be used, take two or three straight 
stitches over each other to fasten the thread. If the slant stitch is to be 
used, take two or three slant stitches over each other and continue with 
stitches of the same slant. 
Avoid taking one kind of a stitch for the fastening, when the fastening 
is visible, and using another kind of a stitch, or a different slant of the 
same stitch, for the work which follows. 
Lesson 387—Tur Knot 
The knot at the end of the thread is used principally in basting. 
To Make the Knot 
1. Hold the threaded needle between the thumb and forefinger of 
the right hand. 
2. Wold the end of the thread between the thumb and forefinger of 
the left hand. 
3. Wind the thread once around the forefinger of the left-hand. 
This forms a loop. 
4. Roll the thread tightly between the thumb and forefinger, and 
with the end of the middle finger draw the loop downward into a small 
knot. 
Lesson 388—Tue Srraieut Srirce 
The Straight Stitch is the foundation of many other stitches, 
among them being the even 
and uneven basting stitches, 
the running stitch, ete. 
To Make the Straight Stitch 
(Illustration VI-1) 
  The needle passes over 
and under the material on Illustration VI-1

61 Fastenings and Stitches Lessons 39, 40     
  
either the line of the work or in a straight position against the 
line of the work. 
Lesson 39—Even Bastine 
Even Basting stitches should be very carefully taken and ‘should 
be used only for marking purposes or for the most particular work. 
To Make Even Bastings 
(Illustration VI-2) 
1. Knot the thread. 
2. Begin at the 
upper or right hand end 
of the work. 
3. Place the needle Illustration VI-2 
through the material, 
taking a straight stitch the exact length each succeeding stitch is 
to be. 
4. Place the needle again on the side upon which you are working, 
at the same distance from where the thread came through as the 
length of the stitch is on the opposite side. Then take a stitch on the 
under side the same length as the previous stitch. 
  Lesson 40—Unrven Bastine 
The Uneven Basting is used for any temporary holding together of 
edges of materials. 
To Make Uneven Basting 
(Illustration VI-3) 
1. Knot’the thread. 
2. Begin at the top of 
the work or at the right 
hand end, and take a short 
straight stitch through the thicknesses of the material. 
8. Draw the thread two or three or more times the distance 
of the length of the stitch on the under side, and place the needle 
again taking a short straight stitch through the material. 
The short stitch should not be taken more than one-half-inch 
in length. : 
This gives a long straight stitch on the side upon which you are 
working, and a short straight stitch on the under or opposite side. 
Continue the work in the same manner.

Lesson 41—ComBination Bastina 
The Combination Basting is used for temporary holdings which 
require a firmer, closer 
stitch than the uneven 
basting gives. 
To Make the Combina- 
tion Basting 
(Illustration VI-4) 
1. Knotthethread. 
2. Begin at the 
top or the right hand Illustration VI-4 
end of the work. 
3. Take alternately long and short straight stitches. 
  Lesson 42—Diaconat Bastine (Padding Stitch) 
The Diagonal Basting is used to hold portions of material together in 
all dressmaking and tailoring. 
It is a long diagonal stitch on the side upon which one is working 
(Illustration VI-5), and a short straight stitch on the opposite side 
(Illustration VI-6). It is also called the Padding Stitch when used 
in tailoring (Illustration VI-7). 
To Make the Diagonal Basting (Illustrations VI-5 and 7) 
       1. Knot the thread. 
2. Begin at the top 
of the work. Take a 
short straight stitch 
across the line of the 
work. (Illustration 
VI-5.) 
8. Continue by 
taking short — straight 
stitches directly below 
this first stitch. (Illus- 
tration VI-6:) 
When used in tailor- 
‘ing for the padding 
stitch the stitches should 
meet as shown in Illus- 
tration VI-7. Illustration VI-6

Lesson 43—Tur Runnine Srircu 
The Running Stitch and the straight 
stitch are exactly the same. The straight 
stitch, however, is made coarse or fine, 
long or short as the occasion demands. 
The running stitch, correctly classified is 
a very fine stitch and is appropriate only 
for the most particular work. Its general 
rule is to go over and under each alter- 
nate warp and woof thread, depending, of 
course, upon the direction in which one 
is working, whether with or against the 
grain. 
On very fine or closely woven ma- 
terials, when working on a straight line, 
draw one of the threads and then the 
needle easily weaves over and under the 
remaining threads. 
  Illustration VI-7 
To Make the Running Stitch (Illustration VI-8) 
1. Fasten the thread with very small back stitches. (Use a needle 
as fine as can be used with the 
material and a thread as fine as 
the needle will carry.) 
2. Pass the needle over and 
under as few threads at a time as 
possible and take up several of 
these small stitches on the needle. 
Then draw the needle through the 
material and continue in the same 
manner. 
  Illustration VI-8 
Lesson 44—Tur Back Srrrcw (Working Upward) 
The Back Stitch is useful for fastenings and for firm hand work. 
To Make the Back Stitch (Working Upward) (Illustration VI-9) 
1. Begin at the lower end of the work. 
2. Fasten the thread on the under side and bring it through to the 
right side. 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
    
Lessons 45,46 American Dressmaking Step by Step 64   
  
8. Take a short straight stitch, keeping 
the needle pointing downward and _bring- 
“ing it out at the place where the thread 
was brought through from the under side. 
4. Continue with straight 
stitches taken just above each 
other, bringing the needle out 
each time at the exact spot 
where it was placed for the 
previous stitch. 
Lesson 45—Tue Back Srircu 
(Working Downward) 
To Make the Back Stitch 
(Working Downward) (Illustration VI-10) 
1. Begin at the top of the work and bring the needle 
through from the under side. 
2. Place the needle the stitch length above where Illustration 
the thread is brought through. Take a straight stitch wD 
downward bringing the needle out the stitch length below where the 
thread is brought through. 
3. Place the needle upward to the lower end of the first stitch. 
Bring the needle out an equal length below the thread. Continue with 
the same stitch. 
  Illustration VI-9 
  Lesson 46—Tur Hair Back Stircu (Working Upward) 
Also called The Outline Stitch (Illustration VI-11) 
To Make the Half Back Stitch (Working Upward) 
1. Begin at the lower end of the work. 
2. Fasten the thread on the under side of the material 
and bring the thread through to the right side. 
8. Take a short straight stitch with the needle pointing 
downward. 
4. Take the next stitch directly above the first one, 
letting the needle come out half the length of the stitch 
above the previous stitch which was taken. 
This stitch makes rows of long straight stitches on the 
right side of the work and even straight stitches on the 
under or opposite side. Illustration VI-11 shows both 
  Tllustrati ;, .

Lesson 47—Tue Harr Back Srircu (Working Downward) 
Also called The Seed Stitch (Illustration VI-13) 
The Half Back Stitch (working downward) is not only useful for 
firm hand work as in making seams, fastenings, etc., but is quite orna- 
mental for a filling stitch in embroidery, and is also 
used in making tucks on silk or 
satin where there will be no strain. 
To Make the Half Back Stitch 
(Working Downward) 
(Illustrations VI-12 and 13) 
1. Begin at the top of the work 
and bring the needle through from 
the under side. 
2. Take a short straight stitch 
above where the thread came 
through, and take a long stitch i 
Tilustration VI-12 underneath. Tilstration Views 
3. Continue taking — short 
straight stitches just above where the thread comes out and long straight 
stitches under the work. The space between the stitches may be of 
any desired length.    Lesson 48—Tue Suant Strircu 
The Slant Stitch is slanting on the side on which 
one is working and the opposite side. It is used to 
hem bias and irregular lines and in work where the line 
does not fall straight with either the warp or the woof 
of the material. 
To Make the Slant Stitch (Illustration VI-14) 
1. Begin at the top of the work. 
2. Fasten the thread with two or three back 
stitches under the fold of the hem. 
3. Bring the thread through to the top of the hem, 
close to the edge. Illustration VI-14 
4. Let the thread fall downward on a slant. Place 
the needle into the material the distance below where the thread comes 
out, which you wish the slant stitch to be. Keep the needle in a slanting 
position and pass it under the hem. Let the needle come out through 
the top of the hem close to the edge. Continue with the same stitch.

Lesson 49—Tur Srraicut Hemmine Srircu 
The Hemming Stitches are straight on one side and slant on the 
other. They are useful in hemming and finishing work on straight lines. 
(See slant stitch, Lesson 48, 
for irregular lines.) If one 
wishes the straight stitch to 
appear on the hem side and 
the slant stitch on the oppo- 
site side use the Straight 
Hemming Stitch. 
To Make the Straight 
Hemming Stitch 
(Illustration VI-15) 
1. Begin at the top of 
the work. 
2. Fasten the thread un- 
der the fold of the hem with 
two or three back stitches. 
3. Bring the needle 
through to the top of the 
hem close to the edge. Illustration VIS 
4. Place the needle into 
the material opposite the place where you brought through the thread.

2. Fasten the thread with two or three back stitches under the 
fold of the hem. 
3. Draw the thread through to the top of the hem close to the edge. 
4. Place the needle into the material as shown in Illustration VI-16. 
The size of the stitch is determined by the distance between where the 
thread comes out and the needle is placed. 
5. Hold the needle in a straight, crosswise position and bring it out 
through the hem close to the edge. 
Lesson 51—Tun Invisisie Sup Srircu 
The Invisible Slip Stitch is for 
quick finishing work and can be 
used on any line. It is one of 
the most valuable stitches for 
every-day work. 
To Make the Invisible Slip Stitch 
(Illustration VI-17) 
1. Baste the hem but not 
too near the edge. 
2. Begin at the top of the 
work and fasten the thread under 
the fold of the hem. 
3. Bring the needle out 
through the crease of the fold at 
the under edge of the hem. 
4. Place the needle straight 
up and down through the ma- 
terial under the edge of the hem. 
The needle should pick up one or Illustration VI-17 
two threads only with this stitch. 
5. Let the needle slip the desired distance under the hem. Bring 
it out through the crease of the turning of the hem and proceed as above 
directed. 
On the right side of the garment this stitch shows only where the 
needle has picked up the one or two threads to hold the hem in place. 
On the hem side the stitch is entirely invisible. 
  Lesson 52—Tue Buinp Srircu 
The Blind Stitch is useful for invisible hemming and finishing work. 
Its name designates its character. When finished no stitch is visible 
  
   
-P-A-G-E-78
    
Lesson 53 American Dressmaking Step by Step 68   
  
on the hem side and no stitch is seen on the opposite side except where 
the needle has picked up one or two threads to hold the hem in place. 
To Make the Blind Stitch (Illustration VI-18) 
1. Baste the hem a little distance from the edge of the turning. 
2. Begin at the top of the work. 
Fasten thethread under the fold of the 
hem with two or three back stitches. 
3. Bring the needle out through 
the crease of the turning of the hem. 
Do not bring the needle through to 
the top of the hem or the work will 
not be invisible. 
4. Place the needle through the 
material under the edge of the hem 
and pick up one or two threads of the 
material under the hem. 
5. Take three or four fine run- 
ning stitches in the turned under 
portion of the edge of the hem. Do 
not catch these stitches through the 
hem itself or into the material of the 
garment. 
6. Bring the needle out through 
the crease of the turning of the hem 
and continue as above directed. Illustration VI-18 
  ' Lesson 58—Top Srircuine 
(Overcasting, Overhanding, and Whip Stitching) 
Top Stitching is hand stitches taken on the edge of the work. The 
stitches may be very fine and close together, or they may be long and 
some distance apart. Top Stitching is also known under the names of 
Overcasting, Overhanding, and Whip Stitching. 
To Do Top Stitching 
(Illustrations VI-19 and 20) 
1. Hold the work in the 
left hand with the edges of the 
work upward. 
2. Place the needle from 
the back of the work with the 
needle pointing straight to- 
ward you. Illustration VI-19 
   
-P-A-G-E-79

8. Draw the needle through. 
4. Bring the thread over the top of the work and again place the 
needle from the back and continue with the same over and over stitches. 
It is a matter of training, and 
personal choice, whether one works 
from left to right or from right to 
left. You can make your stitches 
either toward you or from you and 
still fully comply with the correct 
application of the principle of this 
work. Illustration VI-20 
  Lesson 54—Tue Catcu Stircu 
In some work, especially on heavy materials, a hemming stitch which 
can be taken on top of the hem is required. In such instances use the 
Catch Stitch, which, when neatly done, is a rather ornamental stitch, and 
is useful in needlework in many places other than in hemming. 
To Make the Catch Stitch (Illustration VI-21) 
If you will keep in mind that in catch stitching the point of the needle 
i; always to the left, and that you work from ‘eft to right, you can not 
possibly have the slightest difficulty in making this stitch. 
1. Begin at the left end and fasten the thread under the hem or 
seam. 
2. Bring the thread through to the top and near the edge. 
8. Carry the thread diagonally across into the material, then take 
a straight stitch, remem- 
bering to keep the needle 
pointing to the left. 
4. Nowcarry the thread 
diagonally across into the 
hem or seam and take a 
straight stitch through but 
do not change the position 
of the needle. In this step it 
is optional with you whether 
you take the stitch through 
the hem or seam only, or Illustration VI-21 
through the material as well. 
Examine the work. On-the opposite side will appear short straight 
stitches, while on the hem or seam side you will have the effect as shown 
in the accompanying illustration.

CHAPTER VII 
CONSTRUCTION WORK 
Lesson 55—Bastina GARMENTS TOGETHER 
Correct basting is essential in good garment making and considerable 
time is saved by careful basting. Baste all fitting, alteration, and 
irregular lines. Straight edges, and those of uniform length or width, 
upon which there is to be no fitting or alteration, can be sewed together 
without basting. 
Cotton thread may be used for basting on all materials except silk, 
satin, or velvet. The latter should be basted with silk thread, so that 
when the basting is removed it will not leave thread marks. 
Use a little larger needle than for ordinary hand sewing. 
Before basting, carefully match all notches, and pin the garment 
together. 
When basting a straight edge and a bias edge together baste whenever 
possible with the bias edge toward you. 
Baste a short distance from the sewing line in order that the basting 
stitches will not be sewed into the garment when the final work is done. 
To remove bastings, clip the basting thread every few inches and 
always draw from the knot end. 
Rules for Garment Basting 
Underarm seams—Baste from the waist-line upward. 
Shoulder seams—Baste from the neck toward the arm-scye. 
Side-front seams—Baste from the bust-line upward to the shoulder 
and downward to the waist-line. 
Side-back seams—Baste from the shoulder-blade line upward to the 
shoulder and downward to the waist-line. 
Darts—Baste from the point of the dart to the broad portion of the 
dart. ; 
Sleeves—Baste from the bottom of the sleeve upward. 
Skirts—Baste from the waist-line downward, except on tight-fitting 
skirts—then baste from the hip-line upward and the hip-line downward. 
Plackets—Baste from the bottom of the placket upward. 
Lesson 56—Tur Pian SEAM 
A Plain Seam is the basis of many other seams. It is never a finished 
seam unless the edges are self finished with selvedge, overcast (Lesson 
53), bound as an open seam (Lesson 65), or as a closed seam 
(Lesson 66). 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  
7 Construction Work Lessons 57, 58   
  
To Make the Plain Seam (Illustration VII-1) 
Baste the two 
edges of the material 
together and sew 
along the marked 
seam line, or if no 
width seam is desig- 
nated, stitch 3 of an Illustration VII-1 
inch from the outer 
edge of the material. If material is inclined to fray, allow 14-inch. 
  Lesson 57—TuHE TurNED-IN SEAM 
The turned-in seam is used when a finished closed seam is required, 
and the line of the garment such that the French seam is not practical, 
as on underarm and skirt seams. 
To Make the Turned-in Seam (Illustration VII-2) 
1. Make a plain 
seam on the under side 
of the garment. 
2. Turn both edges 
of the seam toward each 
other, turning each side 
exactly the same amount. : ee 
3. Baste the edges Illustration VII-2 
together. 
4. Stitch the edges together or finish by top stitching (Lesson 53). 
  Lesson 58—Tue Fett Sram 
(Illustration VII-3) 
The Fell Seam is especially suitable for 
seams on underwear made of medium weight 
material. ‘The Fell Seam is not used on very 
thin material, as the edges of the seam will 
show through the goods. 
To Make the Fell Seam 
1. Make a plain seam on the under, or 
wrong side of the material. 
2. Trim to a narrow edge on one side of 
the seam, leaving the other side 3 of an inch é 
wide. Illustration VII-3 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  
Lessons 59,60 American Dressmaking Step by Step 72   
  
3. Make a narrow underturning on the untrimmed or 3¢-inch 
edge, making the turning toward the narrow trimmed edge. 
4, Lay the work flat on the table, and crease or press the wide turned 
edge over the trimmed edge. 
5. Baste down very carefully. 
6. Finish with any of the hemming stitches. (Lesson 48, 49, or 50.) 
Lesson 59—Tuer Frencu Fett Seam 
(Illustration VIT-4) 
To Make the French Fell Seam 
1. Make a plain seam on the under side 
of the material, either 34 of an inch wide or 
trim to 34 of an inch width. 
2. Trim one edge of the seam to 44-inch. 
8. Make a 14-inch fold on the edge of the 
untrimmed or 3¢ of an inch width portion of 
the seam, folding toward the trimmed edge. 
4. Bring the edge of the fold of the wide 
portion of the seam to the seam line. 
5. Finish with any of the hemming 
stitches. (Lesson 48, 49, or 50.) 
The French Fell Seam when finished is a 
standing seam, and, like the French seam, 
shows no stitching on the right side of the 
garment. It is the daintiest of all the many seams, especially when 
the plain seam is made by hand with a running stitch. 
  Illustration VII-4 
Lesson 60—Tue Frencu Sram (Illustration VII-5) 
The French Seam is for thin 
materials and dainty garments. 
It should be used on lines that 
can be easily turned. Often, 
however, the French seam is 
used where the Turned-in Seam 
should have been used and a 1 
most undesirable effect is pro- Illustration VIL5 
duced. 
  To Make the French Seam 
1. Baste the garment right side out, basting on the exact seam line. 
2. Stitch the seam 14 of an inch outside of the Seam Line 
8. Trim all edges of the seam down to 1 of an inch.

4. Remove the bastings. 
5. Press the seam together. ; 
6. Turn the seam to the under side of the garment and encase the 
raw trimmed edges by basting them inside of a seam 14 of an inch wide. 
This casing must be wide enough to cover the edges of the first seam 
so that no raw edges or threads show on the right side of the garment. 
If a 1% of an inch finished French 
Seam is desired: 
1. Baste on the seam line. 
2. Stitch 1% of an inch outside of the 
seam line. 
3. Trim both edges of the seam to 415 
of an inch width. 
4. Press the seam together.

and encase in a 1% of an inch seam. 
Lesson 61—Tue Frat Frencu SEAM 
(Illustration VII-6) 
Some times the loose edge of the 
French Seam is not desired, especially on 
underwear and long seams. In this in- 
stance the French Seam is made as usual, 
then pressed and basted flat. It is either 
machine stitched or hemmed by hand. Tilustration VIL6 
  Lesson 62—Tur Frencu Foup Snam (Illustration VII-7) 
This seam is used in all cases where the seam lines are to be 
covered as much as possible, as in chiffon, lace, and other delicate fabrics. 
To Make the French Fold Seam 
1. Baste the gar- 
ment right side out, 
basting exactly on 
the seam line.

4. Remove the bastings, and press the seam to one side. 
5. Turn the seam to the underside of the garment. Make a fold 
covering the raw edges of the seam and stitch the fold exactly on the 
seam line. 
This gives a fold instead of a seam at the edge of the casing. 
‘Lesson 683—Tue Rott Sram (Illustration VII-8) 
The Roll Seam is used when the edges are to be joined and the 
material ravels or draws and an exceptionally narrow joining is required. 
To Make the Roll Seam 
1. Trim both edges of the material 
evenly. 
2. Hold the edges together. Roll 
together the top thread of both edges 
two or three times. 
8. Begin from the back of the 
work and whip the roll very closely to- 
gether, being careful that the stitches 
come entirely under the roll, not through the roll. Draw the thread tightly. 
This seam will leave a small roll or welt.

Lesson 64—Tue Wuip Sram (Illustration VII-9) 
The Whip Seam is used on firm material when a narrow and incon- 
spicuous seam is desired, as for sheets, pillow-slips, etc. When the 
material frays or pulls out the 
Roll Seam must be used. 
To Make the Whip Seam 
1. Baste the two edges 
evenly together. 
2. Place the needle point- 
ing straight toward you from 
the back and top of the work. 
Follow all of the instructions Tilustration VII-9

8. Draw the thread through to the side nearest you, being careful 
not to pull the thread too tightly or it will form a welt which will not 
press out flat. ;

2. Press the seam open. 
3. Trim the edges of the seam evenly. 
4, Use seam binding of a width that will fold 
easily over the edges. The usual width is 3¢ of 
an inch, but on heavy materials a wider binding 
should be used. Fold this binding either in the 
center or a little to one side of the center, which- 
ever method is preferred, and press the crease 
with a warm iron. 
5. Slip the edge of the seam between the 
folds of the binding, so that the tape entirely 
covers the edge of the seam. Stitch, making one 
row of stitches catch the edges of the binding on 
both sides of the seam. 
In some instances it is well to put the binding

On most materials a bias seam, or even a slightly 
bias seam, should be stayed. This does not mean 
the old-fashioned way of taking a wide piece of 
tape and stitching it in with the seam leav- 
ing a very ugly finish. A very 
narrow cotton or linen tape 
answers the same purpose. 
To Make the Stayed Seam 
1. Baste the bias seam. 
2. Baste the tape directly 
over the seam line. 
8. When the seam _ is 
stitched the tape is stitched 
with it. This keeps the seam 
from stretching.

5. Trim the edges of the seam evenly, and narrow enough so the 
edges of the tape can be folded over the edges of the seam. 
6. Stitch each edge of the seam separately. This means three rows 
of stitching to make the seam; one when the seam and the two rows of 
tape are stitched together and one on each side of the open seam. 
This method is used only on wide seams and heavy materials. The 
binding must be very light in weight otherwise the turnings can not be 
made neatly.

The Welt Seam is used only on materials heavy enough so that the 
edge of the seam does not show through the fold. It is entirely unsuited 
to thin goods. 
To Make the Welt Seam 
1. Make a plain seam, usually on the right side of the garment. 
2. Trim to a narrow edge one side of the seam, leaving the other side 
the desired width of the welt, allowing for the turning. 
3. Make a narrow underturning on the wide edge. 
4, Lay the work flat on the table and crease and press the wide 
turned edge of the seam over the trimmed or narrow edge. 
5. Baste carefully. 
6. Stitch near the edge of the fold. 
The welt of the seam can be made on either 
the right or the under side of the garment. If 
the welt is to appear on the right side, baste 
the garment with the seams on the right side. 
If the welt is to appear on the under side 
baste the plain seam foundation on the under 
side. The Welt Seam is always machine 
stitched, never hand sewed. It is a Fell Seam 
when it is hand sewed.

been placed together, will make the seam. 
When correctly made, there will be no raw 
edges appearing. 
Another Way to Make the Seam 
(Illustration VII-21) 
1. Leave the edges untrimmed, and lock 
the portion which is turned under on to the 
portion which is turned over. 
2. Stitch in the center of the turned edges 
of the fold. This leaves a small tuck on both 
sides. It is also called the Lock Seam.

To Make the Stayed Slot Seam 
1. Cut a stay of the same ma- 
terial as the garment and one inch 
wider than the slot seam is to be 
when finished. For instance, if the 
fold on 
each side Illustration VIL-26 
of the 
seam is to be one inch wide, the completed 
seam is two inches wide. A three-inch stay 
is then needed. It is usually better, whenever 
possible, to have one of the edges of the stay 
cut with a selvedge edge and bind the other 
edge. When this is not possible bind both 
edges. The stay must always be cut on the 
straight of the material. 
2. Baste a marking thread down the exact 
center of the stay. 
8. Fold under each side of the edges of the

HEMS 
Lesson 85—Ftar Untrorm Hem (Illustration VII-30) 
A uniform hem should be of uniform width and great care should 
be taken in turning it. If working on a straight edge, the following 
method is good: 
1. Make the narrow 
turning wide enough so that 
none of the raw edges will 
work out from under it. Do 
not make this first turning 
carelessly, as the line of 
stitching, which will show 
on the right side of the gar- 
ment, will follow this turning. 
2. Draw a thread on 
the line of the first turning. 
3. Then, from this nar- 
row turned edge, measure 
the exact depth which the finished hem is to be and draw another 
thread on this line for the second turning. Creasing under on this [ine 
completes the turning of the hem. 
4, Finish with hemming stitch 
(Lesson 49 or 50) or machine stitch. 
If working on an irregular line so 
a thread can not be drawn: 
1. After making the first turning, 
measure with a 
tape measure or 
gage from the 
first turning to Illustration VII-31 
the depth the 
finished hem is desired and then make the second 
turning. 
2. A gage (Illustration VII-31) is made by 
taking a straight piece of cardboard and cutting 
a notch at the exact width the finished hem 
is to be.

5. With both thumbs roll the top thread over two or three times, 
rolling toward you. Do not try to roll with one thumb, as you can not 
roll so quickly, so tightly, or so straight as you can when you use both 
thumbs. 
6. Whip the roll tight with whip stitches taken very close together, 
letting the stitch come under the roll and not through it. Roll only an 
inch or two at a time, and whip down the hem as you roll.

It is used on irregular lines and is joined on the straight lengthwise or 
straight crosswise thread according to the nap 
or the surface thread, having all seams run in . 
the same direction. (Illustration VII-41.) 
The Fitted Facing is a facing cut on the same 
grain as the material, and following exactly the 
line of the entire portion to be faced. It is used 
on all irregular lines, and on all curves except 
the arm-scye. (Illustrations VII-44 and 45.) 
The Exceptional Facing is a bias strip put on 
by using two threaded needles at the same time. 
The stitches on the outside and the inside edges 
are taken alternately. In this way the inside 
edge of the facing is kept smooth and the fuller 
line of the outside edge is so adjusted that the 
facing will lie flat. (Illustrations VII-46 and 47.) 
Lesson 94—To Appiy Factnes 
Facings are either set on or sewed on to the 
edge of the garment. All facings but the Ex- 
ceptional Facing can be handled in either of 
these ways. 
The Exceptional Facing, on account of the curve of the edge which 
it finishes, is always a Set-on Facing. 
  Illustration VII-41 
Lesson 95—Srwep-on Facine (Illustration VII-42) 
The Sewed-on Facing has one edge sewed to the edge of garment 
with a plain seam, and the other edge turned under and hemmed down. 
To Make the Sewed-on Facing 
1. Study the line to be faced. If the line is a perfect straight or 
bias edge, cut the fac- 
ing on the warp 
thread or the cross- 
wise of the material. 
If the line is an irre- 
gular one, cut the 
facing on the perfect 
bias. The facing 
must be the exact 
width desired, with Illustration VII-42

34 of an inch allowed on one side for a turning, and 3¢ of an inch 
allowed on the opposite side for a seam. 
2. Lay the right side of the facing to the right side of the garment 
with the edges together, and stitch a 3¢ of an inch seam. 
3. Turn the facing to the under side, and draw the seam back jg 
of an inch from the edge of the garment and baste. In all under facings 
the seam or edge of the facing is brought back a littlk—but not more than 
1 of an inch, from the edge of the fold. In the making of over facings 
on collars and revers, bring the edge of the facing to the edge of the 
garment. 
4. Turn under the unsewed edge of the facing 3 of an inch, and 
baste. 
5. Finish with any of the ways of hemming (Lesson 48, 49, or 50). 
Lesson 96—Srt-on Factne (Ilustration VII-43) 
To Make the Set-on Facing 
1. Qut the facing either straight, bias, or fitted, according to the 
line which is to be faced. The facing must be the exact width desired, 
with 3¢ of an inch allowed on each edge for turning. If the facing is 
to be very narrow, a smaller turning is allowed. 
2. Turn under the edges of the facing the amount allowed, and 
baste and press the turnings. This makes a finished strip. 
8. Turn under the edges of the garment and baste the turning. 
When facing an irregular line, it is sometimes necessary to clip the turn- 
ing so the edges will spread sufficiently to keep the material from 
drawing. 
4. Baste outside edge of facing 1 of an inch from edge of garment.

5. If the facing is wide, make one or two rows of diagonal bastings 
between the two edges of the facing to hold it flat. 
6. Baste the inside edge of the facing, and finish both edges with 
any of the ways of hemming, or machine stitch. 
Lesson 97—Tue Frrrep Facrea (Illustrations VII-44 and 45) 
The Fitted Facing is suitable for curves, points, and irregular lines. 
To Make the Fitted Facing 
1. If possible, select a piece of the same material as the garment. 
Whether or not the same material is used, match the grain of the goods, 
and lay the edge of the garment right side downward on the right side 
of the uncut material, which is to be used for the facing. 
2. Baste the edge of the garment flat onto the facing material. 
(Illustration VIT-44.) 
8. Machine 
stitch the edge of 
the garment to the 
material, so the 
work will be firm. 
4. Cut the fac- 
ing material the 
same shape as the 
edge of the garment 
to be faced. 
5. Clip the edge 
of each curve until 
the facing will lie 
smooth. 
6. Turn the fac- 
ing to the under Tlustration VIT-44 side, drawing the 
seam back and under about 3g of an inch from the edge of the garment. 
7. Baste 1 of an inch from the edge of the garment. 
8. An even distance from the bottom line, mark the exact width 
the facing is desired. 
9. Cut the facing 3% of an inch beyond this line. 
10. If the facing is wide, baste with two or three rows of diagonal 
basting stitches. 
11. Clip the edges and turn under the top edge of the facing. Baste 
with uneven basting stitches. (Illustration VII-45.)

TUCKS AND PLAITS 
Lesson 118—GENERAL InstRucTIONS For MaKkIna 
Tucks AnD Piarrs 
A tuck is a fold of material stitched through both thicknesses of the 
fold. 
A plait is a fold of material stitched through both thicknesses of the 
fold and through the material. 
Tucks may be divided into three classes: 
1. The plain tuck. 
2. The pin tuck. 
3. The Crosswise or Nun tuck. 
Plaits are usually divided into three divisions: 
1. Side plaits. 
2. Box plaits. 
3. Inverted plaits. 
In fancy plaiting which is done by machine, one may have a great 
variety of plaits, such as: 
1. Knife plaits. 
2. Accordion plaits. 
8. Sunburst plaits, etc. 
The manner of making tucks is usually divided into: 
1. Even tucks. 
2. Graduated tucks. 
8. Group tucks. 
When there are tucks or plaits and the pattern plainly marks their 
width, the problem is easy to handle. It is simply a 
matter of matching perforations, basting the tucks or 
plaits and stitching them exactly on the line which is 
marked, 
Where there are no perforations and one must allow 
for the tucks or plaits, care must be exercised that the 
length and width are correct, that they are the correct 
distance apart, and lie in the right direction. 
Lesson 114—To Maker «a Gace to Mark Tucks or 
Puarrs (Ilustration VI-65) 
1. Mark a piece of cardboard the exact width the 
finished tuck is to be.

Crease plait and stitch the desired width, 
stitching through both thicknesses of the fold 
and the material, or the plait may be basted and pressed flat without 
stitching. Plaits should usually be stayed by tacking occasionally to a 
tape on the under side.

RUFFLES 
Lesson 124—GeENERAL 
InstRUCTIONS FOR MAKING 
RUFFLES 
1. With a pin or colored 
thread divide the ruffle into 
such proportions as the fulness 
is desired. If an equal fulness 
is desired, divide first into 
halves, then into quarters, and if 
the ruffle is long it should be 
divided into eighths. 
2. Ruffles are usually gath- 
ered about 1 of an inch from the 
top edge. 
3. When gathering always 
use a double thread with a large knot, and do not draw the thread all of 
the way to the knot until the gathering is finished. 
4. Do not gather beyond the divisions marked on the ruffle, but cut 
the thread at the eye of the needle when the division point is reached. 
Then make a large knot at the end of the thread, and start the next 
division with another thread. 
5. All gathering should be done with very small running stitches, 
as the gathering does not have an even appearance when long, coarse, 
or uneven stitches are used. 
6. Two rows of gathers are sometimes used when the material is 
difficult to handle. 
7. When a ruffle must be pieced, join the ends of the ruffle in any 
one of the following methods: 
On materials that fray or ravel, roll both edges together in a roll, and 
whip very tightly. This will give a small welt or roll where it is Joined, 
and i is called the Roll Seam (Lesson 63). 
On materials with a selvedge baste the two edges together and whip. 
This will make a flat, smooth joining and is called the Whip Seam 
‘(Lesson 64). 
Other seams used to join ruffles are the Fell Seam (Lesson 58), the 
French Fell: Seam (Lesson 59), and the Double Stitched French Welt 
Seam (Lesson 77). 
8. To baste on the ruffle: Divide the garment into the same number 
of divisions as the ruffle. Pin the ruffle on the corresponding division 
marks of the garment. 
9. Wrap the ends of the gathering threads around a pin and even

Lessons 125,126 American Dressmaking Step by Step 106   
  
up the gathers, or work them into the place desired .by holding the gar- 
ment straight up and down and stroking the ruffle until the fulness falls 
correctly. Stroke between the gathers with the point of a needle, or, 
if delicate material, use a bone stiletto. 
10. Baste the ruffle to the garment, and finish in accordance with 
any desired n:ethod of application. The fifteen best methods are herein 
presented. 
Lesson 125—Tne Heapep Rurr te (Illustration VII-78) 
The Headed Ruffle is suitable for a full ruffle on thin material. 
To Make the Headed Ruffle 
1. The heading of a ruffle may be from 4 of an inch to any width 
desired. Turn under the entire top of the ruffle 34 of an inch more than 
the finished heading is to be. 
  Illustration VII-78 
2. With a double thread, leaving a large knot, make two rows of 
gathers very close together. The first row of gathers should be 3¢ of 
an inch above the raw edge of the turning, and the second row just 
above it. Proceed exactly as given in General Suggestions for Making 
Ruffles.

Lesson 129—RuFries AppLinp WitH THE WELT Sram 
(Illustration VII-82) 
On heavy materials it is often necessary to join the ruffle to the gar- 
ment with a Welt Seam, and many find this an easy way to dispose of 
the ruffle problem. 
To Apply Ruffles With the Welt Seam 
1. Gather the ruffle and distribute the fulness. 
2. Join the ruffle to the garment with a plain seam, making the 
seam come on the right side of the work.

When a ruffle has been applied with the French Seam, the seam may 
be stitched flat to the garment. On some materials it gives a much 
better appearance to the ruffle. 
This method, however, is not advisable for use on muslin, as it 
is too clumsy.

PREPARING, HANGING, AND FITTING WAISTS 
Lesson 140—PreEpPARATION OF A Loose Waist OR CORSET-COVER FOR 
Frrrine (Hlustration VITI-1) 
After the garment has been basted together it is prepared for 
fitting. 
The Stay Line 
1. To make the stay line use a double thread of the same color 
used to finish the garment. Never use basting thread for this work. 
  Illustration VIII-1 
2. Leave at least 4 inches on each end of the thread and make a 
knot at each division. 
8. Do not shirr the material or draw the threads tight until the 
garment is ready to hang. 
4, Never let.a stay line or draping line cross a center-back, center- 
front or a side line without a break at these points, as this makes it 
easier to adjust the garment properly. 
5. Begin at the center-back at the waist-line, and bring the shirrings 
across to within 11-inch of the underarm seam at the waist-line. Begin 
114-inch on the opposite side of the underarm seam and carry the line 
to the center-front.

Make a line of small even stitches 14-inch above the waist-line, 
making the same divisions as in the stay line. 
For underwear this row of shirring is made one-half an inch above the 
natural waist-line. 
Lesson 142—Tur Temporary Bewr 
The temporary belt is a straight piece of muslin at least 214 inches 
wide and 2 inches longer than the waist-line measures. On this strip 
of muslin the waist is hung to obtain the correct lines. 
Tesson 143—Hanetrna a Loose Waist or Corsrt-covER 
(Illustration VITI-2) 
at is necessary in the hanging of a loose waist or corset-cover that the 
stay threads and draping threads are in the right place; that they be put 
in correctly, and that there is at least 4 inches of end left on each division 
of the threads. 
To Hang a Loose Waist or Corset-cover 
1. Place the temporary belt around the waist and pin together ai 
the center-front if the 
garment opens in 
front, or at the cen- 
ter-back if the gar- 
ment opens in the 
back. 
2. Put on the 
garment and pin it 
together with- 
out drawing the stay 
threads or the drap- Tllustration VITI-2 
ing threads. 
8. Pin the stay line of the garment, pinning the center-back and 
center-front line of the waist to the center-back and center-front of the 
temporary belt. 
4, Pin underarm line of garment to temporary belt at waist-line. 
5. As no shirring or fulness comes nearer to the,underarm seam 
than 14-inch, pin the garment to the stay belt 114-inch from each side 
of the underarm seam. 
6. Let the garment fall naturally on the side-back lines. Place the 
hand at about the center of the shoulder seam and let it fall downward 
to the bottom of the waist, following the side-back line. - Pin the garment 
to the waist-line at this point. This distributes the gathers so that they 
   
-P-A-G-E-127
    
say Specific Work on Garments Lesson 143   
hang correctly from the shoulder-blade line and in the right proportions 
toward the underarm seam. 
7. Draw the stay threads. Always drape from the center toward 
the sides. Draw the stay threads back and forth so they move easily. 
Draw the threads tightly, fastening them around the pin placed 11-inch 
from the underarm seam. 
8. Stroke the gathers on this stay line until they fall evenly, and 
hold them in place with pins placed straight up and down on the stay line. 
  Illustration VITI-3 
9. Bring the hand from the center of the shoulder seam downward 
over the tip of the bust, following the side-front line. Pin the garment 
at this point to the temporary belt. 
10. When the work is finished on the stay line, begin at the center- 
back and take both ends of the threads of the draping line, and draw 
the threads back and forth, lifting them upward to bring the gathers 
‘straight up and down from the stay line. Draw the thread tightly and 
wrap around the pin which has been set 114-inch from the underarm seam. 
11. Stroke the gathers straight up and down from the stay line,

holding them in place with pins set so that they alternate between the 
pins on the stay line. 
12. If, when all of the draping is completed, the garment requires 
alteration, alter according to Lesson 145.

seams, front and back, from shoulder to waist-line. Then take up 
(Illustration VIII-3, C), or let out (Mlustration VII-4, F), on the underarm 
seam to complete the fitting. 
2. If the waist-line needs altering. If the garment fits everywhere 
except that it is too large around the waist-line, take it up on the underarm 
seams. (Illustration VIII-5, G.) In some cases it may be taken up on 
the darts or side seams. (Illustration VIII-5, H.) If the garment is 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  
119 Specific Work on Garments Lesson 144   
  
too small around the waist-line, first let out the darts, then let out the 
underarm seams. 
3. If a garment is too wide or too narrow across the shoulders and 
chest, alter on front side seams from shoulder to tip of bust. (Illustrations 
VIIL-6, I and 7, J.) 
4. If a garment is too wide or too narrow on the across back line and 
the shoulders, alter on the side-back seams from shoulder to shoulder- 
blade line. (Illustrations VIII-6, K and 7, L.) 
  Illustration VIII-5 
5. If a garment is too long or too short on the shoulder and fits across 
the chest and across the back, alter on the side seams from the shoulder to 
the chest-line (Illustrations VIII-6, I and 7, J), and from the shoulder to 
the across back line. (Illustrations VITI-6, K and 7, L.) 
6. If a garment is too long or too short from shoulder to tip of bust, or 
from neck to bust-line, or in the arm-scye, the alterations are made on the 
shoulder seams of the garment, taking up on the shoulder seam to 
shorten (Illustration VIII-3, M), or letting out the shoulder seam to give 
added length (Illustration VIII-5, N). This alters the garment for a

Lesson 144 American Dressmaking Step by Step 120   
  
flat or full chest, high or low bust, for thin or fleshy front arm-scye, or for 
square or sloping shoulders. 
7. If a garment is too long or too short from neck to shoulder-blade line, 
or from shoulder to shoulder-blade line, or in the back arm-scye, all altera- 
tions must be made on the shoulder seam, taking up the seam to shorten 
(Illustration VIII-8, O), or letting out the seam to lengthen (Illustration 
VIII-5, P). This is the alteration made for high or low shoulder-blades, 
  Illustration VIII-6 
thick or thin shoulders, fleshy or thin back arm-scyes, or stooping or 
straight shoulders. All alterations for round shoulders or protruding 
shoulder-blades or very straight figures with receding shoulder-blades 
should be made on the pattern. (See Lessons 21 and 22.) 
8. If a garment is too long waisted, it must be re-fitted at the waist- 
line and the seams re-adjusted below the waist-line. — (Illustration 
VIII-8, Q, R, and §.) 
9. If a garment is too short waisted, it must either be entirely re-fitted 
or be set into a belt or be covered by a girdle, or the skirt cut with a waist- 
line high enough to make up for the shortage in the length of the waist.

Lesson 149—Jornine Banps (Illustration VIII-15) 
A Joining Band is for the purpose of joining two or more garments. 
For instance, a corset-cover and skirt are jomed with a joining band, 
which is made as follows: 
1. Cut two strips of material the exact width and length the band 
is to be, allowing 3¢ ef an inch on all edges for turnings. 
2. Turn under all edges 3¢ of an inch. 
It makes no difference whether the band is first joined to the outside 
or the inside portion of the garment. Both sides are finished the same. 
Baste one of the turned strips 3 of an inch above the draping line of the 
waist or corset-cover. Use colored thread, and baste 1 of an inch from 
       
-P-A-G-E-135

the edge of the band. 
The colored thread 
will be the guide line 
to show just where to 
place the band on the 
opposite side. 
4. The other 
edge of the belt is 
basted 34 of an inch 
below the top edge of 
the skirt or lower gar- 
ment, and is basted 
with the colored 
thread 14 of an inch 
from the edge of the 
band. 
5. Turn the gar- 
ment to the opposite 
side, and baste the 
belt 14 of an inch 
outside of all of the Illustration VIII-15 
colored bastings. 
6. One row of stitching around the four edges of the belt finishes 
the joining of the garment on both sides. 
  Lesson 150—Tur Facep Bann 
Sometimes one desires to use embroidery, insertion, or beading to 
make the overportion of the joining band. 
To Make the Faced Band 
1. If the embroidery strip has a margin, turn under the margin. 
If using embroidery beading or lace, it will be used just as it is. 
2. Make the top portion of the band of the embroidery beading or 
the insertion. The linen or lawn margin is turned under to the finished 
portion of the embroidery or beading, and basted. 
3. Cut the lining or under portion of band the exact width of fin- 
ished insertion or beading plus 3 of an inch on all edges for turnings. 
4. Baste all under turnings on these edges 3 of an inch. 
5. Apply the same as the joining band. (Lesson 149.) 
Lesson 151—To Make Tue Banp Casina 
1. Make the band exactly the same as for the plain band (Lesson

Lessons 152,183 American Dressmaking Step by Step 126   
  
2. Finish the ends of the band with a narrow hem (Lesson 85), or 
facing (Lesson 95), and draw elastic tape through the band to hold the 
garment snugly to the waist. 
Lesson 152—Tne Puan Castine (Illustration VIII-16) 
Many persons prefer a casing for the bottom finish of a garment, 
especially light 
silk waists and 
garments they de- 
sire comfortable 
around the waist- 
line. 
If the waist is 
cut so that the 
bottom edge can be 
turned up for hem- 
ming, it may be 
turned andstitched 
on both the lower 
and the turned 
edge. 
The usual 
method, however, 
is not to turn up a hem, but to finish the garment at the waist-line with 
either a straight sewed-on or set-on overfacing. (Lesson 95 or 96.) 
After the turnings have been made, or the facing put on, insert an 
elastic tape about 1 inch wide and of a length which, by stretching slightly, 
reaches around the waist-line, and then sew on the hooks and eyes. 
  Illustration VIII-16 
Lesson 153—Tur Overcasine (Illustration VIII-17) 
For garments where every line must fall exactly right, the overcasing 
is found to be the best to use. 
To Make the Overcasing 
1. Prepare the garment for draping. (Lesson 140.) : 
2. The casing used is nothing moreor less than the temporary stay belt. 
Make the stay belt of the same material as the garment. (Lesson 142.) 
3. The waist is then draped on to the temporary stay belt (Lesson 
143), which is put around the body much looser than a band. 
4. The garment is then stitched to the lower edge of the temporary 
stay belt or casing. 
5. Bring the casing over the lower edge of the waist and upward 
on the right side of the garment.

to the edge of the peplum. 
Turn in the open top edges and slip the garment between, bringing 
the upper edges of the peplum 1% of an inch above the stay line of the 
garment and stitch. 
The lined peplum is made exactly as is a belt. (Lesson 182.) This 
makes the garment finished alike on both sides.

A Marern (Illustration VIII-18) 
To join a garment 
with beading or em- 
broidery or insertion 
which has a linen or 
lawn margin, it is usu- 
ally best to make the 
upper joinings with a 
French seam (Lesson 
60) and the lower join- 
ings with a flat French 
seam (Lesson 61). The 
loose edge which is 
always on a French 
seam is not desirable 
on the top edge of a 
petticoat or drawers, so 
the edge of the seam 
which is loose may be 
stitched flat to the 
garment, forming a 
flat French seam. 
Ifmachinestitching 
is not desired to finish 
the flat French seam, 
use the hemming 
stitch. (Lesson 49 or 
50.) 
Or if the roll seam 
(Lesson 63) is used in- 
stead of the French 
seam (Lesson 60) or 
flat French seam 
(Lesson 61), the work 
will be much daintier 
altho not so durable 
or so quickly done. 
The roll seam is 
preferable when the 
garment is made by

finished with a bias sewed-on facing (Lesson 95). 
Lesson 160—To Jorn Waists AND Skirts TOGETHER 
1. The skirt is fitted to a permanent stay belt. The top of the 
skirt is then brought to the correct line of the waist and they are 
machine stitched together. The waist portion is then trimmed up to 
3 of an inch of the stitching and the raw edges covered neatly with 
a narrow facing, or the entire belt is covered with lawn or lining to hide 
all darts, stitching, and raw edges. 
2. When a stay belt is not used and a belt is desired, a joining 
band is applied. (Lesson 149.)

The Kimona Sleeve 
Where there is no seam at the arm-scye or where the sleeve is cut in 
one piece with the garment. Many of the so-called drop-shoulder sleeves 
are in this class. 
Lesson 172—To Prepare Sterves To Br Sewen In (Illustration VILI-28) 
If the pattern gives notches between 
which to gather, begin at the front 
notch of the sleeve, using a double 
thread with a large knot, and make 
small running stitches 1% of an inch from 
the top edge of the sleeve to the back 
notch. On each end of the shirrings leave 
three or four inches of thread. This row of 
stitches constitutes the Stay Line. 
The Stay Line is not put in to shirr and 
gather the sleeve, but to draw closely over 
the shoulder, so in case no fulness is desired 
the fulness can be taken out. Shrinking 
out the fulness at the top of the sleeve 
is not usually done. 
Put in another row of shirring 14 of an 
inch below the first row of shirring. This 
— row of shirring is called the Draping Tllustration VITL.28 
Line. 
  Lesson 173—To Prepare Sterves To Br Ser In 
1. Turn under the arm-scye edge of the garment 3¢ of an inch and

Lesson 174—To Pur IN Sterves 
1. Read the pattern instructions and find out exactly where the 
sleeve goes. ‘The pattern may state to match the notches, join the under- 
arm seam of the sleeve to the underarm seam of the garment, or the 
specific number of inches that the underarm seam of the sleeve is to be 
placed from the underarm seam of the garment. 
2. Bring the arm-scye edge of the garment over the top of the sleeve. 
In other words, have the edge of the sleeve slip directly under the edge of 
the garment, fastening at the underarm seam of the garment.

8. Match the front notch of the sleeve with the front notch of the 
garment if the front lines are notched. 
4. Match the back lines in the same manner if these lines are 
notched. 
5. If every alteration on the sleeve pattern has been made to corre- 
spond with the alteration made on the arm-scye of the garment, the sleeve 
will fit with ease, and it will set

Draw the sleeve up under the arm- 
seye until any fulness not desired is 
taken out, or bring the sleeve down- 
ward from the’shoulder to give any 
fulness required.

If a sleeve is too large, it must be 
taken up on the seams. 
If the sleeve is too small, it must be 
let out on the seams. 
If the sleeve is so tight after all

Lesson 183 
Either procure a foundation girdle, which is shrunk, cut, boned, and 
shaped, or buy a pattern the size, width, and style desired and cut the 
foundation of percaline or canvas. 
1. Fit the girdle foundation. Pin together at the place where the 
girdleis to fasten. Leave the foundation plenty large around the waist, but 
fit it snugly at the top and bottom. Wherever the girdle is too large, fit it 
by taking up a dart on the side lines and under the arm until the exact 
size desired has been obtained. If through some miscalculation the girdle 
is too small around the body, slash the foundation on one of the center 
lines and piece with the same material of which the foundation is made. 
2. Bone the girdle with feather boning. The boning is stitched down 
the center and not on the edges. The edges may be catch stitched to the 
foundation if desired. If the girdle is for a large figure, bone on the side- 
front and side-back lines and centers. If the girdle is for a figure of 
medium size, bone over the hips and on the center lines. 
8. Bind the top and bottom edges of the foundation. 
4. Turn under the top and bottom edges of the material used to 
cover the foundation, cutting it of a width approximately as follows: To Make Girpies

For a plain girdle cut the outside material the same width as the foun- 
dation, plus 3¢ of an inch on all sides for turnings. 
For a slightly full girdle, cut the outside material one and one-half 
times the width of the foundation, allowing extra for the turnings. 
For a medium full girdle, cut the outside material twice the width of 
the foundation, allowing extra for the turnings. 
For a full girdle, cut the outside material from three to four times the 
width of the foundation, allowing extra for the turnings. 
5. Baste the bottom edge of the turning of the material 1 of an inch 
beyond the edge of the foundation, and catch stitch the material to the 
foundation. Bring the top edge of the material 14 of an inch above the 
top edge of the foundation, and catch stitch the material to the foundation. 
6. Put the girdle on the body and arrange all folds and drapes. 
7. Catch the drapes in place with French Tacks. (Lesson 223.) 
8. Finish the fronts of the girdle with a heading or face the ends and’ 
tie in a loop, or in any of the methods in vogue from season to season. 
9. Sew on the hooks and eyes. (Lesson 215.)   
SKIRTS 
Lesson 184—PREPARATION OF A SKIRT FoR HANGING 
After the skirt seams have been basted, the next step is to prepare the 
skirt for hanging. All skirts except the straight skirt are hung in prac- 
tically the same manner, which is as follows: 
Turn under the top of the skirt 34 of an inch and baste. If a wider 
margin was marked on the pattern, turn under on the width line indicated. 
To Make the Stay Line 
1. Thread the needle with a double thread and make a knot. Use the 
same color of thread which is to be used to finish the garment. Never 
use basting thread. 
2. Begin at the center-back and make the stay line 14 of an inch from 
the top of the fold of the garment, making a row of small even stitches 
from the center-back line to 11-inch back of the hip-line. Do not draw 
the thread so that it gathers. Leave at least 4 inches of thread and 
make a knot. 
8. Begin 114 inch to the front of the hip-line and continue the stay 
thread 1% of an inch from the top of the skirt to the center-front. Break 
the thread, leaving a 4-inch end, then knot the thread. 
4. Make the stay line in the other half of the skirt as above directed. 
To Make the Draping Line 
The draping line is made 1% of an inch below the stay line. Use the 
same kind of thread, making the stitches in the same manner with the 
same divisions as made in the stay line. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
    
Lesson 185 American Dressmaking Step by Step 140   
  
In Making a Straight Skirt, instead of breaking the stay line and drap- 
ing line 14-inch from the hip-line, break the stay and draping lines at 
one-fourth of the width of the skirt, leaving no space between the shir- 
rings on the hip-line, which, of course, on a straight skirt, is not indicated 
as on other skirts. 
In Making a Full Piece, Gored, or Circular Skirt, instead of breaking 
the stay line and draping line 14-inch from the hip-line, break the stay 
and draping lines at exactly the hip-lines, leaving no space between the 
threads at this point. 
Lesson 185—Tue Stray Betr (Illustration VIII-38) 
A Stay Belt is the inside belt on which a skirt is hung. This stay belt 
may be of stiff cotton webbing for woolen material, silk webbing for silk 
material, or mercerized webbing for cotton or linens. It should be the 
exact width directed by thepattern-makers. If they have drafted their skirt 
pattern for a 3-inch 
raised waist-line above 
the natural waist-line, 
and the skirt is hung 
on 1-inch belting, the 
result will not be good. 
Or should the pattern- 
makers draft a pattern for a natural waist-line and the skirt is hung on 3- 
inch belting, the effect will be unsatisfactory. If the pattern does not 
state specifically the exact width of belting desired, measure the pattern 
of the belt included with the skirt pattern, and figure accordingly. 
In procuring skirt belting, buy about 4 inches more than the waist-line 
measures. The extra 4 inches is needed for the taking in of the darts and 
finishing of the edges. h 
The webbing for wash garments should be thoroughly shrunk before 
it is used. 
Sometimes the skirt opens at the side-front, and the stay belt shows an 
opening at the center-front. Whenever this is shown on the pattern, it is 
usually advisable to have the opening of the belt exactly where the pat- 
tern-makers designate. 
1. Put in all darts. 
If the pattern-makers have marked where the darts are to be, make the 
tailors’ tacks through the perforations, crease on the marked line and 
stitch the width directed on the pattern. 
Begin the stitching in the center of the darts, not at the end of the 
darts, and stitch twice. 
Should the pattern-makers not give the exact place for the darts and 
straight belting does not fit, put them in, in accordance with the figure. 
  Illustration VITI-38 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  
141 Specific Work on Garments Lesson 186   
For medium sized and small figures, one dart may be at either the center- 
front or back, depending upon where the closing is, and one dart over each 
hip. For large figures make the darts on the side-front and side-back 
lines, midway between the hip and center-lines. 
2. When the darts are in and the ends of the stitching threads tied, 
put onthe belt. If the darts are placed‘next to the body it gives a smooth 
surface for the skirt to fall over. The way the belt is arranged at the 
waist-line will determine much of the style of the skirt at the waist-line. 
Tf a high waist-line is desired, bring the wide edge of the dart at the 
waist-line, and the narrow point of the dart above the waist-line. This 
brings the wide part of the belt upward, and the narrow part of the belt 
to the waist-line. 
If a natural or low effect is desired, place the wide part of the darts of 
the belt to the waist-line and the point of the darts downward. 
8. Fold back the ends of the belt so they meet at the closing. 
4. Sew on hooks and eyes. (Lesson 215.) Sew the edge of the hooks 
so they will come 1 of an inch inside the right edge of the belt. Sew the 
eyes so they will extend just beyond the opposite or left-hand edge of the belt. 
5. Bind the raw edges of the turning of the belt. 
The stay belt is then complete and ready for the garment to be hung onit. 
Lesson 186—To Hane a Sxirt (Illustration VIII-39) 
1. Put on the stay belt, being careful that the belt is placed so that 
the darts are pointing in the right direction. (See Lesson 185.) 
2. Puton the skirt and pin the top of the skirt at the center-front, the 
center-back, and at each hip-line, drawing up the top of the skirt 14 of an 
inch above the top of the stay belt. 
8. If the garment is a fitted skirt with hip-lines, pin the skirt 114 
inch on both sides of the hip-line. 
4. Pin up the placket, being very careful to pin the placket from the 
bottom toward the top, and to pin on the exact seam line, taking up the 
amount of the seam allowance. ; 
5. Begin at either the center-front or the center-back to hang the 
skirt. Take both ends of the stay thread, and both ends of the draping 
thread at the same time and work the threads back and forth, always 
draping from the center lines toward the hips. Draw the threads tightly 
and wind them around the pin which is placed 114-inch from the hip-line. 
6. Place pins straight up and down and quite close together to hold 
the skirt to the stay belt. 
7. See that the skirt rests correctly over the hip-line and that all 
lines fall in a perfect line and angle from the waist-line to the hips, and 
that the garment does not sag or draw at the natural waist-line. 
8. Make any necessary alterations. (Lesson 187.)

Lesson 187 American Dressmaking Step by Step 142   
Lesson 187—Sxirt ALTERATIONS 
All fitting should be done on the pattern (Lesson 30). After the gar- 
ment is cut it is too late to do scientific fitting. When instructions have 
not been carefully followed, it is sometimes necessary to make alterations 
on the garment. In this instance, the following rules are observed: 
To Alter a Skirt When the Waist-line Is Too Large 
Take up the seams at the 
waist-line the necessary 
amount. This line should 
hang free at the waist-line. 
It should never be so tight 
that the skirt draws and sinks 
in at the natural waist-line. 
To Alter a Skirt When the 
. Waist-line Is Too Small 
Let out the seams the 
necessary amount to make 
this adjustment. If there is 
not sufficient seam allowance 
to make the skirt large enough 
to fit around the waist, the 
entire skirt must be lifted 
and re-fitted at the hip-line. 
To Alter the Skirt When the 
Hips Are Too Large 
Take up the seams the 
necessary amount to make 
the alteration. | However, 
one should Jook carefully to 
see whether or not the style 
of the skirt does not demand 
the full hips. When a full 
hip is allowed for on the pat- 
tern and the fulness is taken 
out of the skirt, it changes the 
entire line and hang of the 
skirt. When the skirt seems 
too large at the hips, by 
bringing the fulness to the Illustration VIIL-39      
-P-A-G-E-153
  
143, Specific Work on Garments Lesson 187   
  
center-back at the waist-line the adjustment is often made more satis- 
factory than if the seam was taken up over the hips. 
To Alter the Skirt When the Hips Are Too Smali 
Let out the seams the necessary amount to make the alteration. If 
there is not sufficient seam allowance, the entire skirt must be lifted and 
re-adjusted at the waist-line. 
To Alter the Skirt When It Is Too Large Across the Thighs 
It is very seldom that an alteration is made to take out extra width 
across the thighs. In case it 7s necessary to do so, the width is taken out 
of the seams, graduating from the hip-line to the bottom of the skirt. 
To Alter the Skirt When It Is Too Tight Across the Thighs 
Let out the seam covering the thighs, or if this can not be done, the 
entire skirt must be lifted and re-adjusted at both waist-line and hips. 
To Alter a Skirt Which Sinks In at the Waist-line 
When a skirt sinks in at the waist-line it is usually found that either 
it has been cut too long from the natural waist-line to the hip-line, or 
else a different: width belting has been used than that which the pattern- 
makers have designated. To remedy this, the skirt is lifted up at the 
belt and the top edge of the garment turned under until the extra length 
has been entirely taken out. 
To Alter a Skirt When It Sinks In at the Hollow of the Back 
Lift the skirt until the wrinkles or sinking portion is entirely taken 
out at the waist-line. Be careful not to draw it up at the hips, but that 
the line is shortened only from the hip-line to the top of the skirt. Some 
women undertake to make this adjustment by tightening the skirt across 
the back, fitting it snugly into the hollow of the back. This is very bad 
taste, to say nothing of bad fitting. It is a shorter length that is needed, 
not necessarily a narrower width. 
To Alter a Skirt Which Is Too Long 
It is usually best to make this alteration at the bottom of the skirt 
by turning to the desired length. Sometimes, however, there are plaits, 
flounces, or drapery which would be made entirely too short if all the 
-extra length were taken off at the bottom. It is then necessary to lift 
the skirt at the top, re-fitting the entire skirt at hoth waist-line and hips 
and then take off the remaining amount of the length at the bottom of 
the skirt.

To Alter a Skirt Which Is Too Short 
The skirt may be lengthened by a band, a lined overfacing, a ruffle, 
or in any other manner of piecing. To piece on to the skirt to add the 
necessary length is the only possible method of making this alteration. 
The skirt should be fitted the correct length before it is cut out. 
PLACKETS 
Lesson 188—PLAcKETS AND CLOSINGS 
No part of a garment shows inexperienced or careless work to more 
disadvantage than the Placket. However, by studying the following 
lessons it will be seen that the making of a well-fitting and correctly 
finished placket is not so great a problem as is generally supposed. 
The opening of the skirt decides the kind of placket to be used. 
1. For Wide Seams—Lap Plackets. 
2. For Narrow Seams—Extension Plackets. 
83. For No Seam—Continuous Lap Placket or Bound Closing. 
4. For Fold Seams—Fold Lap Placket. 
These plackets are never used except as above directed. 
The length of the placket is usually marked on the pattern. When 
it is not marked, it should be of sufficient length so that the garment can 
be easily slipped over the head without tearing the placket opening. 
This length varies so greatly with the figure of the individual, and with 
the style of the garment, that any set rule of length might make the open- 
ing either too long or too short. The better way is to leave the seam 
open to about the hip-line, then remove the bastings down far enough 
to allow the garment to pass easily over the body. 
Nearly all plackets are arranged so the upper portion of the closing 
comes on the right-hand side, and the under closing on the left-hand side 
of the seam, which makes the placket fasten from right to left. 
Lesson 189—Tue Lar Piacker (For Wide Seams) 
(Illustrations VIII-40 and 41) 
To Make the Lap Placket 
1. Baste skirt together with a seam at least 1-inch wide, and leave 
open the top portion of seam the length desired for placket opening. 
2. Baste a line of colored basting threads on both sides of the seam 
to mark the seam line. (Illustration VIII-40.) 
3. Hooks and eyes, or fasteners, should be sewed on before the 
placket is finished, so, before going further with the making of the placket, 
consider whether hooks and eyes, or snap fasteners are to be sewed. 
directly to the garment, or first sewed to tape, and the tape applied to 
the placket. If the hooks and eyes are to be sewed to the garment, 
   
-P-A-G-E-155
  145 Specific Work on Garments Lesson 189   
  
follow all the rules given in the special 
instructions on “Sewing on of Hooks 
and Eyes.” (Lesson 215.) Sew the 
edge of the hooks 1% of an inch from the 
seam line. Sew eyes or fasteners out- 
side of seam line so edge of upper por- 
tion of the placket will close exactly on 
the seam line of the under portion. If 
the hooks and eyes or snap fasteners are 
to be sewed onto tape, stitch the edge of 
the tape 14 of an inch beyond the 
colored thread which marks the seam 
line, and again on the opposite edge of 
the tape. If the material is not strong 
enough to stand the strain of fastening 
and unfastening, or the cloth is so heavy 
the hooks and eyes sink between the 
threads of the weave of the material, 
then the placket must be stayed. For 
detailed instructions how to stay the Illustration VITI-40 
lap placket, see Lesson 191. 
  To Finish the Upper Portion of the Lap Placket 
(Illustration VIII-40) 
1. Turn under on the seam line, and 
baste near the edge. 
2. Turn under the inside edge, baste, and 
hem. 
83. Hem down this edge, following all the 
rules for hemming, given in the instructions 
on hemming. (Lessons 48, 49, and 50.) 
To Finish the Under Portion of the Lap Placket 
1. Use a piece of the garment material, 
unless it is too heavy or flimsy, in which case 
use lining. Cut a straight lengthwise strip of 
material for the facing. If possible, cut the 
facing with a selvedge edge to sew to the seam 
edge of the placket. The facing is 14 of an 
inch narrower when finished than the finished 
hem on the upper portion of the placket and 
should be 1 inch longer than the placket. 
2. Baste the right side of the facing to Tllustration VIII-41

Lessons 190,191 American Dressmaking Step by Step 146   
  
the right side of the loose edge of placket opening, and stitch 1% of an 
inch from the edge. 
3. Turn the facing to the under side, drawing it back 7 of an inch, 
so the seam does not come directly on the edge of the placket. Baste 
down carefully near the edge of the outside seam line. 
4, Make the last turning of the facing, so that its edge is at least 
1 of an inch inside of the marked seam line. This is done so that the 
stitches on facing will not show from under the top of the placket. Finish 
the turning with the Invisible Slip Stitch. (Illustration VITI-41.) 
To Finish the Bottom of the Placket 
Turn under the facing and hem to the seam with hemming stitches. 
Lesson 190—Tue Invistste Lap Piacker (For Wide Seams) 
Sometimes it is not desirable to hem the upper portion of the placket. 
In this instance, make an Invisible Lap Placket. 
To Make the Invisible Lap Placket 
1. Sewastraight,sewed-on facing (Lesson 95),onbothsidesofthe seam. 
2. Sew on the hooks and eyes or fasteners. 
3. Fold under all edges of the facing and hem to the seam. 
Lesson 191—To Stay tHe Lap Puackerts (Illustration VITI-42) 
Always stay that portion of the 
placket to which the hooks, eyes, or 
fasteners are sewed, as follows: 
1. Use a straight piece of lining 
or strip of tape just the width of 
the placket. 
2. Bring one edge of the lining 
or the tape exactly to the marked 
seam line, and baste flat. 
3. Baste the other edge of the 
lining to the outside edge of the 
placket, or, if tape is used, baste 
the edge of the tape to the line 
where the second turning of the 
placket is to be made. 
4. The hooks, eyes, snaps, or 
" other fasteners are then sewed on 
in the usual way and the placket 
finished in accordance with the 
detailed instructions given in this 
chapter.     Illustration VITI-42

2. Run a line of colored basting threads to mark the seam line on 
both sides of the placket opening. 
To Make the Top Portion of the Blacher 
1. Cut a straight facing the exact width the placket is to be, plus 
1 of an inch for the turning, and 14 of an inch for the seam. Cut the 
facing 1 inch longer than the placket opening. 
2. If the placket should be stayed, make the stay according to the 
specific instructions given in Lesson 191. 
3. If the facing has a selvedge edge, baste the selvedge of the facing 
to the edge of the upper portion of the 
placket, and make a seam 14-inch wide, 
or inch from the seam line. 
4. Crease under the facing on the 
line of basting, which marks the seam 
line. 
5. Sew on the hooks or fasteners. 
6. Hem under the loose edge of 
the facing. 
To Make the Under Portion of the 
Placket 
1. Make an extension facing three- 
fourths as wide as the facing of the 
upper portion of the placket. Cut this 
facing 1 inch longer than the placket 
opening. Complete instructions for 
making extension facings are given in 
Lessons 99 and 100. 
2. Slip the edge of the seam be- 
tween the folds of the extension. Do 
not allow the edges of the extension to come nearer to the marked seam 
line of the garment than 1% of an inch. 
3. Stitch the four edges of this extension.

2. Sew the strip of lining to the garment at the same time the facing 
is sewed in, having the lining come between the facing and the garment. 
If tape is used, bring one edge of the tape to the turning of the facing, 
and sew the other edge to the end of the seam between the garment and 
the facing. This will stay the upper portion of the placket. 
To Stay the Lower Portion of the Placket 
Cut the lining or strip of tape just the width of the extension and baste 
it between the folds of the extension. 
Lesson 194—Tue Invistste Extension Puackxer (For Narrow Seams) 
It sometimes happens that on an extension placket it is desirable not 
to fasten the upper portion of the placket to the garment. In this in- 
stance, use the Invisible Extension Placket. 
To Make the Invisible Extension Placket (Ilustration VIII-44) 
1. Leave open the portion of the seam for the placket. 
2. Baste a line of colored basting threads to mark the seam line of 
the placket. 
3. Make two extension facings. When finished one should 
be about 1 inch wide for the upper 
portion and the other about 34 of an 
inch wide for the lower portion, and 
both should be 1 inch longer than 
the placket opening. Study extension 
facings. (Lesson 100.) 
4. Baste the edge of the seam be- 
tween the folds of the extension. Do 
not baste the edges of the extension 
nearer than 1% of an inch to the marked 
seam line of the garment. 
5. Stitch all four edges of this ex- 
tension. 
To Finish the Top Portion of the Placket

To Finish the Lower End of the Placket 
Stitch both edges of the extensions together at the end of the placket. 
Lesson 195—Tur Continuous Lap Piacket (No Seam) 
A Continuous Lap Placket is used where there is no seam in a gar- 
ment, and a slash is made for the opening, and the upper portion of the 
placket is caught to the garment. 
To Make the Continuous Lap Placket (Iustration VIII-45) 
1. Make the slash the desired length of the opening and on the 
perfect straight of the material. 
2. Cut a facing twice the length of the slash, and twice the width 
of the finished facing, plus 3¢ of an inch on one side only for a margin. 
3. Baste and stitch the right side of the facing to the right side of 
the garment ‘in a 
straight continuous line 
from end to end of the 
slash. The seam should 
be just as narrow as 
possible. 
4. Fold under the 
unsewed edge of the 
facing 14 of an inch and 
baste. 
To Finish the Lower or 
Left-hand Portion of 
the Placket 
1. Crease the seam 
toward the facing. 
2. Baste down the 
edge of the fold so it 
covers the seam, bast- 
ing from the top of the 
left-hand or under por- 
tion of the placket to

bound closing.) 
8. Crease on the exact center of the entire facing, and baste the 
crease from end to end. 
‘4, Finish with fine hemming stitches. 
To Finish the Upper or Right-hand Portion of the Placket 
1. Trim off all the material folded under to within 14 of an inch of 
the edge of the fold. (Hllustration VITI-45.) 
2. Crease under on the seam line, and baste this upper portion flat 
against the garment, exactly like a facing. 
8. Finish the upper portion of the placket with very fine hemming 
stitches, or the Invisible Slip Stitches. 
Sew on the hooks and eyes or snaps for the fastening. 
To Finish the Ends—They may be machine stitched or overcast to- 
gether to hold the placket in position. 
Lesson 196—TuE Bounp Ctiostne (No Seam) 
A Bound Closing is used where there is no seam in the garment and 
where a slash is made for the placket and invisible work desired. 
To Make the Bound Closing (Illustrations VIII-46 and 47) 
1. Cut the slash on a perfect straight of the material the desired 
length of the placket. 
2. Cut a facing twice 
the length of the slash and 
twice the width of the fin- 
ished placket facing plus ° 
of an inch on one side to 
allow for a narrow seam 
and the turnings. Baste 
the right side of the fac- 
ing to the right side of 
the garment, keeping the 
edges even. 
8. Stitch the facing in a 
straight, continuous _ line 
from end to end of the slash. 
The seam should be just as 
narrow as it can be made, 
and sewed straight across 
the bottom of the slash, 
being careful that no curve Illustration VIII-46 
   
-P-A-G-E-161
151 Specific Work on Garments Lesson 197 
  
ismadein the seam. ‘The facing should be held a little full at the bottom 
of the closing. (Hllustration VIII-46.) 
4, Fold under the unsewed edge of the facing 14 of an inch and baste. 
5. Crease the edges of the seam toward the turned edges of the facing. 
6. Bring the side of the basted turning so that it covers the seam line. 
(Illustration VIII-47.) 
7. Finish with very fine hemming stitches. 
8. Adjust the placket from the right side so it closes perfectly and 
then stitch diagonally across the 
lower ends of the facing to hold the 
closing in position. 
9. Sew on the hooks and eyes 
or fasteners. 
Lesson 197—Tur Fotp Lap 
Puacker (Illustration VIII-48) 
A lap closing is a closing made 
under a fold or plait. 
To Make the Upper Portion of the 
Fold Lap Placket 
1. Bind the edge of the fold or 
plait. 
2. Turn under on the line of 
the fold or plait. 
8. Sew on the hooks or the 
snap fasteners. 
4. Hem flat with a blind 
stitch (Lesson 52), or should the 
seam be stitched a portion of 
the way, the fold may be stitched Illustration VIII-47 
on the seam line entirely to the 
top of the garment. This finishes the upper portion of the lap closing. 
  To Make the Lower Portion of the Fold Lap Placket 
1. Stitch a straight sewed-on facing on under portion of closing. 
2. Sew on the eyes or fasteners. 
8. Bind the lower edge of the facing but do not catch to the plait 
of the garment. 
4, Lap the folded portion of the closing over the faced portion and 
make an arrow head (Lesson 218), or bar tack (Lesson 220), exactly on 
the stitched line of the inside of the garment. This prevents the placket 
from ripping down on the seam line.

FINISHING WORK 
BUTTONHOLES 
Lesson 206—Position oF THE BUTTONHOLE 
The buttonhole may be made lengthwise or crosswise as best suits the 
line of the garment and the position of the button. The main points 
are that the buttonhole be well made and does not stretch open. Button- 
holes should be made usually on the right-hand side 
of a woman’s garment, so the closing is from right 
to left. The size is generally about 1 of an inch 
larger than the button to be used. 
Lesson 207—Tue Pra BurronHoLe 
(Illustrations TX-1 and 2) 
To Make the Plain Buttonhole 
1. Decide thelength and position of the button- 
hole and mark the place with a colored thread. 
2. Use a single thread, a little heavier than 
that used on the garment, and long enough to make 
the entire buttonhole without a break. 
_ 8. Begin at the back of the buttonhole, working 
from left to right or from 
right to left, and make the 
stay line with very small 
running stitches around the 
mark which shows the 
length and place of the 
buttonhole. The stay line 
is not to be so close to the 
buttonhole mark that later 
the buttonhole can not be 
cut without cutting the stay 
line, nor is it to be so far 
from the buttonhole mark 
that after the buttonhole is 
cut a deep stitch is neces- 
sary to catch the stay line 
with the buttonhole slash. 
Do not cut or break the 
thread, as the work is con- 
tinued with this same 
Illustration TX-1 thread. Illustration IX-2     
-P-A-G-E-170
    
Lessons 208, 209, 210 American Dressmaking Step by Step 160   
  
4. After the stay line is in, cut the buttonhole. 
5. With the same thread used for the stay line, overcast the button- 
hole, bringing the needle out under the stay line. Overcast quite closely, 
keeping the stitches neat and straight, not crowding each other. Again, 
do not break the thread. 
6. Begin at the back of the buttonhole and place the needle half 
its distance through the slit of the buttonhole below the stay line. 
7. At this stage please study the position of the hand. Use the 
thumb and first finger to hold the needle. Use the middle finger for the 
thimble finger. The thread is thrown over the needle with the fourth 
finger of the right hand. Because of its length, shape, and position, this 
fourth finger grasps the thread under and between the first and second 
joints, and without changing the position of the hand one can make 
buttonholes very rapidly. If working from left to right, throw the thread 
over the needle toward the left and draw the thread under the needle 
toward the right, or if working from right to left, throw the thread over 
the needle toward the right and draw the thread under the needle toward 
the left. : 
8. Draw the needle through, drawing the thread tightly so that it 
makes a tight purl edge. 
9. Continue the work in this same manner and finish the corners with 
either a cart-wheel end or barred end. 
10. If either a barred or cart-wheel end is used to fasten the thread 
when the buttonhole is finished, fasten with the Loop Stitch taken twice 
in the same place at the underside of the buttonhole. 
Lesson 208—Barrep ENps 
To make barred ends, bring the thread from underneath the buttonhole 
and take two short straight lengthwise stitches at the end of the button- 
hole. This forms the bar. Overcast this barred thread, bringing the 
stitch through both folds of the material on which the buttonhole is made. 
Lesson 209—Cart-WHEEL ENps 
Cart-wheel Ends are made by crowding the stitches into the end of 
the buttonhole, and spreading the outside edges. Be careful, however, 
that the stitches are not crowded so much that they lie over each other, 
as this makes a clumsy appearance. 
Lesson 210—Frencu Burronnote (Illustration IX-3) 
The French Buttonhole is very easy to make. Follow all of the in- 
structions which have just been given for the preparation of the plain 
buttonhole. In the working of the French Buttonhole: 
1. Begin at the lower left-hand end of the buttonhole. Place the 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
    
161 Finishing Work Lessons 211, 212   
needle through the slash with the point coming out 
just below the stay thread. 
2. Draw the needle all the way through. Do 
not draw the thread tightly, but leave a small 
loop which stands with a half twist. 
8. Place the needle back of the loop with the 
needle pointing toward you, and draw the thread : 
through, drawing upward and tightly. This Tllustration IX-8 
gives a beautiful purl edge. 
  Lesson 211—Tue Tattorep Burronnote (Illustration IX-4) 
To Make the Tailored Buttonhole 
1. Mark the exact place and length of the buttonhole with a colored 
thread. The Tailored Buttonhole should always be made crosswise of 
the garment. 
2. Put in the stay line. The stay line should follow the shape of 
the finished buttonhole, which will be barred at the back and an eyelet 
in front. 
8. Cut the buttonhole. Cut all of the way to the end of the marked 
thread and then clip the material inside of the eyelet so a good shape 
can be secured. If the material is very heavy it is sometimes necessary 
to trim out a little of the material so that the eyelet will be smooth. 
There are regulation scissors for cutting the Tailored Buttonhole. 
4. If a very firm edge is desired for the 
buttonhole, make a foundation for the edge, either 
by taking a few strands of thread and waxing 
them together, or use a very small round tailors’ 
braid and catch to the cut edge of the buttonhole 
with loop stitches. (Lesson 241.) 
5. The buttonhole is then worked the same 
as the Plain Buttonhole (Lesson 207). When 
working the front of the buttonhole a stiletto 
should be used to shape the eyelet. 
6. ‘The back of the buttonhole should be 
finished either with a bar tack (Lesson 220) or an 
arrow head (Lesson 218).

  Tilustration TX-5 8. Cut the facing or binding one inch 
longer than the slash is to be cut, and cut it 
two inches wide. If the facing or binding is 
not cut on the bias, it must be cut on exactly 
the same grain, matching the warp and woof 
threads of the facing with the warp and woof 
threads of the garment. 
4. Baste the center of the facing to the 
center of the buttonhole mark. Baste the 
right side of the facing to the right side of the 
garment, entirely covering the marking of the 
buttonhole. 
5. Turn the garment to the wrong side, 
where the mark- 
ing for the slash 
now shows and 
make another 
row of basting 
stitches on the 
same line so that 
they will show 
through to the

7. With a very sharp knife or scissors 
cut the buttonhole to within 1% of an inch or 
more of the size marked, cutting through 
both facing and garment, then cut diagonally 
to the corners of the stitching, being careful 
not. to cut the machine stitching.

FASTENINGS 
Lesson 214—Srwine on Burtons 
Examine the button and see whether there are holes through which 
to fasten it to the garment, or whether it is sewed on through a shank. 
Use a heavy thread and if possible use one strand, as a double thread 
twists when coming through 
the button, and often gets 
tangled. However, if the 
thread is not strong enough 
it may be doubled. 
To Sew on Buttons 
(Illustration IX-9) 
1. After the button- 
hole or loop has been made, 
bring the garment together 
exactly as it is to be closed 
and mark the place for the Illustration IX-9 
button. 
2. Place the button over the mark. Fasten the thread with two 
or three secure back stitches under the material. 
8. If there are holes in the button, sew through each of them, either 
across the button, or from side to side, keeping a pin under the threads 
to allow freedom for the button. If there is a shank on the button, sew 
through the shank, being careful not to draw the stitches too tightly. 
   
-P-A-G-E-174
  Lessons 215,216 American Dressmaking Step by Step 164   
  
4, When the button has been sewed securely to the garment, wind 
the remaining amount of thread around the threads which hold the 
button to the garment, winding between the button and the material. 
5. Fasten the thread with two or three back stitches on the underside 
of the material. 
Lesson 215—Hooxs anp Eyres 
In sewing on hooks and eyes, it is better to use a strong single thread 
than to have a fine double thread. 
Eyes are usually sewed on so their edge will extend about 1 of an inch 
beyond the edge of the garment. 
Hooks are usually sewed on so the edge of 
the bill comes about 1 of an inch inside of 
the edge of the garment. In this way, the 
garment will be neatly closed and will not 
gape. 
To Sew on Hooks and Eyes 
(Illustration TX-10) 
1. Sew the hooks through the rings and 
over the bill, using either the Over and Over 
Straight Stitch (Lesson 38), or the Button- 
hole Stitch (Lesson 253). 
2. Sew the eyes through the rings and over the sides, using either 
the Over and Over Straight Stitch or the Buttonhole Stitch. 
  Mllustration TX-10 
Lesson 216—Loops 
Loops, to take the place of eyes 
through which to fasten the hooks, are 
of two kinds: the Whip Loop and the 
Buttonhole Loop. 
To Make the Whip Loop 
(Illustration TX-11) 
1. Use a double thread, and fasten se- 
curely on the underside of the garment. 
2. Draw the thread through to the 
right side of the garment and take a 
stitch upward the length you desire } 4 
the loop to be, leaving the thread very Tlistration 1Xe11 
slack.

4. Draw the thread through again in the same manner. 
5. Whip the loop, allowing the eye of the needle to pass under the 
thread first, and whip close enough so that there is no space between the 
whip stitches. Do not, however, crowd these stitches so that they fall 
across each other. 
6. Fasten the thread on the underside of the material with a secure 
back stitch. 
Lesson 217—Tur Burronno.e Loop 
To Make the Buttonhole Loop 
1. Use a double thread, and fasten it securely on the underside of 
the material. 
2. Draw the thread through to the right side, and take a stitch 
upward the length you desire the loop, keeping the thread very slack. 
8. Bring the thread back under the material to the place where the 
thread was first brought through, and take another stitch in the same 
manner as the first one. 
4. Hold thread down with thumb of left hand, forming a loop. 
5. Let the eye of the needle fall under the thread first and push it 
through the loop with the thimble against the point of the needle. 
6. Draw the thread tightly, and when at the end of the loop, fasten 
on the underside of the material with firm back stitches.

brought through. (Fig. 2.) 
5. Carry the thread upward and take a short, straight stitch across 
and underneath the top of the Arrow Head. Place the needle so that 
the thread falls outside of the stitches first made, and so the point of the 
needle comes outside of the left-hand diagonal thread. (Fig. 3.) 
6. Carry the thread downward to the right-hand end of the Arrow 
Head, placing the needle to the left of the thread at that point and bring- 
ing it out to the right of the left-hand diagonal stitches. (Fig. 4.) 
The stitches at the top of the work are all taken outside of the previous 
stitches, while the stitches at the lower part of the work are taken inside 
of all preceding stitches. Fig. 5 shows the finished Arrow Head.

with each stitch. 
MARKING AND STAY TACKS 
Lesson 221—Tattors’ Tacks (Illustration [X-15) 
Tailors’ Tacks are used in all construction work. They should 
always be put into the garment before it is cut out, and not afterward. 
To Make Tailors’ Tacks 
1. Thread a double thread, but 
do not knot it. 
2. Take astraightstitch through 
a perforation, and through both 
thicknesses of the material. 
8. Draw the thread through, 
leaving an end at least one inch long. 
4. Place the needle again 
through the same perforation in the 
same manner as you did in Step 2. 
5. Draw the thread through, 
leaving a one-inch loop. Cut the 
thread one inch from the loop to- 
ward the needle. 
6. Proceed to the next perfora- 
tion in the same manner. In long 
rows of perforations, you may draw 
thethread from one perforation to the 
next without cutting each time, until 
the Tailors’ Tacks are all finished. 
7. After the garment has been cut out, and all pins removed, clip 
the threads between the folds of the material and then remove the pattern. 
8. In sheer materials repeat this process, making two loops, as one 
loop does not always stay in.

through to the upper portion which is to be 
joined, leaving about one-inch end of the 
thread to be tied on the under portion of the 
garment, also leaving enough extra thread to 
give the garment whatever ease may be re- 
quired between the folds of the material. 
8. A short stitch is taken through the 
upper portion of the garment and back 
through to the underside of the upper por- 
tion only of the material. 
4. The French Tack is then covered 
with loop or buttonhole stitches. (Lesson 
258.) Illustration IX-16 
5. Bring the thread through to the

INSERTIONS AND EDGINGS 
Lesson 227—Settine In Lace Insertion (Illustration IX-21) 
If the lace is to be set in on a straight edge, a very satisfactory way 
is as follows: 
1. Hem the edges of the material with a very narrow hem. It should 
be zz of an inch wide, or not over 75 of an inch at widest. Hem with 
small, fine hemming stitches. 
2. Hold the right side of the lace away from you and just enough 
higher than the hem so the meshes can easily be seen, and picked up with 
the needle. 
8. Whip — through 
every mesh of the inser- 
tion, being careful not to 
pull the thread too 
tightly. 
4. When one side is 
finished, join the inser- 
tion to the opposite edge 
in the same manner. 
5. When _ finished, 
press out smoothly, and 
it will look as if the lace 
had been woven into the 
material. Illustration IX-21

broidery insertion, do the whip stitch work with embroidery cotton to 
match the texture of the embroidered work. 
Lesson 228—Sertine In Insertion ror Less Important Work 
On work of less consequence, the very narrow hem can be put in by 
machine, and the lace whipped on by hand. Of course, any machine 
work on a very dainty garment greatly reduces its value. 
Lesson 229—Srrtina In INseRTION FoR 
Very Quick Work (Illustration TX-22) 
There are machine attachments with 
nearly all machines, which will both hem 
and set in lace in one operation, and to the 
busy woman it is a great help for unimpor- 
tant work. If you do not possess a machine 
attachment of this character, and there is 
a reasonably heavy edge on your insertion, 
proceed as follows: 
1. Turn the edges of the garment to 
the right side, with a very narrow turning. 
2. Set the edge of the lace over the 
turned edge of the material, baste carefully 
and stitch securely with the machine. 
This, of course, is not fine, high-class e 
work, but it is used to advantage on inex- Tllustration [X-22 
pensive garments.    
      Lesson 230—Wutppine ON Lace Epaine 
The Roll Hem is usually used in connection with a ruffle or with lace 
edging. 
To Put Lace Edging on a Roll Hem (Mlustration IX-23) 
1. Always make the Roll Hem toward you. For instructions to 
correctly make the 
Roll Hem, see Lesson 
91. 
2. Hold the lace 
edging away from

every mesh and under the roll hem, holding the lace full and the roll 
tight, and drawing the thread tight. 
Lesson 231—To Futt On Lace 
One does not gather lace edging unless it is real lace. Draw the 
manufacturer’s thread which is found in all manufactured lace edging. 
This will gather the lace to any fulness desired. Then whip each mesh 
of the lace to the roll hem, exactly as directed in Lesson 230.

Lesson 233—Srrtine In Lack Desians 
In setting in lace designs, great care must be taken to keep the goods 
perfectly flat while basting on the design, otherwise it is apt to draw up 
and away from the material when finished. 
To Ser In «a Desiten (Illustrations [X-26 and 27) 
1. Stamp or outline on the material the design to be made. 
2. Baste the material on heavy paper or thin oilcloth, basting outside 
of the stamped design. :

3. In using lace insertion, 
baste the outside edges perfectly 
even and flat, giving no atten- 
tion, at present, to the inside line. 
Baste with very close stitches. 
If the material is basted onto 
oilcloth, be careful not to catch 
the threads through the oilcloth. 
4. When the outside is care- 
fully basted, draw the thread on 
the inside edge of the insertion 
until the inside edge lies perfectly 
flat with the inside line of the 
design. 
5. Distribute the fulness as Illustration [X-26 
evenly as possible, and baste down all edges closely and carefully. (Illus- 
tration IX-26.) 
6. Clip the basting threads, which hold the goods to the paper 
or oilcloth, whichever has been used, and remove the bastings. 
7. Turn the 
work over to the 
underside and 
clip the material 
between the two 
rows of bastings. 
8. Trim the 
material down to 
a narrow turn- 
ing close to both 
edges of the 
bastings. 
9. Clip the 
remaining mate- 
rial wherever 
there is a decided 
curve or angle. 
10. Roll the 
edges into a very 
tight roll hem, 
rolling toward 
the underside of 
the material.

Lesson 234 American Dressmaking Step by Step 174   
  
every mesh of the insertion used for the design. (Illustration IX-27.) 
This gives a beautiful finish on the underside, and a perfect effect on 
the right side. 
Many people prefer, in Steps No. 3 and No. 4 of this lesson, to whip 
through each mesh of the insertion instead of basting, and in Step No. 10, 
to roll the hem over the whip stitch, again catching through the meshes 
as they roll the hem. This will hold the design in place more securely, 
but usually the material will outwear the design, anyway, and the effect 
on the wrong side is not quite so good. 
Lesson 234—Srrtine In Mepauuions (Illustrations [X-28, 29, and 30) 
Medallions having a lace mesh edge are put on exactly as designs 
aresetin. (Illustration IX-28.) If the medallion is made of embroidery 
with an open or irregular edge, put 
it on in the same manner. If the 
medallion is made of embroidery 
with a close edge, or has no meshes, 
proceed as follows: 
1. Baste the material on heavy 
paper or thin oilcloth. 
2. Baste the design on the exact 
place of the material where it is to 
appear, taking care not to baste too 
close to the edge of the medallion, 
as you must leave the edges around 
the medallion free to turn. Keep 
the work perfectly flat. 
3. Catch down the outside 
edges of the medallion, using 
either very fine running stitches 
or very close slant. stitches. 
(Illustration IX-29.) 
4. Remove the material 
from the paper or oilcloth. 
5. Trim the material on 
the wrong side down to a nar- 
row turning, under the medal- 
lion. 
6. Either roll the hem as 
for setting in lace designs, or 
turn the edges of the material 
perfectly flat toward the right

around the entire edge of the 
medallion. (Illustration TX-30.) 
Lesson 235—VEINING AND SEAMING 
(Illustration TX-31) 
Many people desire their gar- 
ments to be joined together with 
veining or seaming. This veining 
or seaming comes with a narrow 
margin of lawn or linen at both of 
its edges. These edges are joined 
to the garment with the ordinary 
French seam (Lesson 60), or witha 
plain seam double stitched (Les- Illustration IX-30 
son 72), or with a roll seam (Lesson 63). 
If the French Seam is used, make the seam just as narrow as possible 
and still hold the garment securely together. In addition to following 
closely all the rules for French seaming (Lesson 60), keep in mind that 
the final seam line must be at the exact woven edge of the veining. 
If the Plain Seam is. used, be careful that the first row of stitches comes 
exactly at the woven edge of the veining. 
Press the edges of the seam and the veining away from the veining. 
Stitch on each side of the seam and close to the veining, following all 
of the rules for the Double Stitched Plain Seam (Lesson 72). 
HEMSTITCHING 
Lesson 236—Puiarw Hemstircuine (Illustration TX-32) 
To Make Plain Hemstitching 
1. Decide the exact width of the uni- 
form hem to be hemstitched. 
2. Draw the first thread for the hem- 
stitching at the exact line where the top of 
the hem is to be. 
8. Draw all of the other threads above 
the thread which marked the top of hem. 
4. When the required number of 
threads have been drawn, turn a flat uni- 
form hem and baste it down carefully. 
Be careful that the top of the hem comes to 
the first thread drawn.

ward you. Begin at the left-hand 
end and work toward the right. De- 
cide the number of threads to be in 
each group of hemstitching. 
7. Bring the thread to the right 
and across the front of this group. 
Hold the thread in the form of a loop. 
8. Point the needle to the left 
and pass it back of the threads, and 
out to the left of the group of stitches, 
drawing it through the loop. 
9. Draw the thread tightly and 
take a small hemming stitch at the 
right of the group of stitches. Take the hemming stitch through the 
hem only. 
10. With the point of the needle, divide off exactly the same number 
of threads of the material to the right of where the thread now falls. 
Pass the needle back of these threads, and continue with the same stitch 
explained in Steps 8 and 9 of this lesson. 
  Illustration IX-32 
Lesson 237—Douste Hemsrircuine (Illustration [X-33) 
To Make the Double Hemstitching 
Hemstitch both the edges exactly the same, with the exception that 
since there is a hem on only one edge through which to fasten the thread, 
on the opposite edge the hemming stitch is taken through the material. 
This stitch holds the thread straight from top to bottom. 
Lesson 238—SrrPENTINE oR ZiazaG Hemstitcuine (Illustration [X-34) 
To Make the Serpentine Hemstitch 
1. Hemstitch the line of threads nearest the hem (Illustration IX-32). 
  Illustration IX-33 Illustration IX-34

w7 Finishing Work Lesson 239   
  
2. On the opposite edge hemstitch in exactly the same manner, 
except that the needle passes back of half of the threads of the division 
where the thread comes through, and half of the threads from the next 
division where the needle is placed each time. This gives the zigzag 
effect from which the hemstitching derives its name, Serpentine. 
Lesson 239—Macuine Hemstircuine 
(Illustrations IX-35 and 36) 
To Make Machine Hemstitching 
1. Place a soft, thick piece of blotting paper between the two pieces 
of material to be joined. If the blotting paper is thin, use two thick- 
nesses of it. 
2. Stitch together on the machine, using a sufficiently loose tension 
and regulating the size of the stitches according 
to the width of the hemstitching desired. (Illus- 
tration IX-35.) 
8. When the seam is stitched, pull the blot- 
ting paper 
away. 
4. Press 
the seam 
open, _press- 
ing back each 
edge of the 
underside. 
(Illustration 
Illustration IX-35 IX-36.) Illustration IX-36    5. Stitch each turned-back edge flat with machine stitching placed 
close to the hem, trim the edges and roll, whipping close to the line of 
hemstitching. Or, if the hemstitching is to be at the top of a hem, 
bring the fold of the top of the hem-line to the hemstitching and 
baste over the raw edge of the seam. Finish with the Straight 
Hemming Stitch (Lesson 49).

ORNAMENTAL WORK 
Lesson 240—Tue Cross-stircn (Illustration X-1) 
To Make the Cross-stitch 
The Cross-stitch is made 
by carrying one slant stitch 
across the angle of the other. 
The accompanying cut 
shows the proper manner of 
placing the needle and carry- 
ing the thread. 
The beauty of this style 
of needlework depends upon 
having all the upper stitches 
run in the same direction. 
The Cross-stitch is an 
easy and effective stitch for 
use on children’s garments. Illustration X-1 
  Lesson 241—Tue Buianxer Srircn (Illustration X-2) 
The Blanket Stitch is also the Buttonhole or Loop Stitch and is used 
for edge work. 
To Make the Blanket Stitch 
1. Begin at the left-hand side of the work, a little distance up from 
the edge. Hold the thread down with the left thumb, in the form of a 
loop. 
2. Draw the needle through under the edge of the material and 
through the loop. 
8. Again hold the 
thread down with the 
left thumb. 
4. Place the 
needle a little  dis- 
tance from the first 
stitch, and again 
bring it down through 
the loop. 
5. Continue with 
these stitches. 
Variations of this stitch are given in the following lesson.

Lesson 243—Tur Ovuriine Srrrcu (Illustration VI-11, P. 64) 
The Outline Stitch is the Half Back Stitch taken upward or away 
from you. It may be done in two ways—one in which a heavy effect is 
produced, and another which, if carefully executed, will have the effect of 
an unbroken line. 
Embroidery threads are twisted from left to right or from right to left. 
According to the twist of the thread either of the two effects mentioned 
is produced. If the stitch is taken with the twist of the thread, the 
unbroken line or etching outline is produced; if taken contrary to twist, 
the heavy or corded outline is the result. 
The reason why there are often unsatisfactory effects produced is 
that the needle is not kept in a perfect line with the design to be outlined, 
or the thread is not kept to the same side of the needle. 
Many beautiful effects can be achieved by this simple stitch. Whole 
designs may be outlined, or the stems may be outlined and the flowers 
made solid, whichever may be preferred. 
‘o Make the Outline Stitch 
1. Begin at the bottom of the work and fasten the thread with a few 
running stitches. 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
    
Lessons 244,245 American Dressmaking Step by Step 180     
  
2. Throw the thread over to the 
left or right of the needle, and place the 
needle with the point straight toward 
you. 
8. Take a short stitch toward you 
and draw the thread, being careful not 
to draw too tightly. 
4, Again, throw the thread to the 
left or right of the needle, whichever 
way you have started the work, and 
take another stitch toward you, and 
continue in the same manner. 
Lesson 244—TuHE Srep Sritcu 
(Illustration X-5) 
The Seed Stitch is made by taking 
small half or quarter back stitches misinion ke 
covering the leaf or petals of a design or 
monogram. ‘The rows must be evenly spaced and the stitches in each 
row fall midway between the stitches of the previous row. 
  Lesson 245—Tuer Cuatn-stitcu (Illustration X-6) 
The Chain-stitch is a closed link or closed loop stitch. This stitch is 
very useful for padding embroidery scallops, putting in hems, and for 
many purposes where an ordinary stitch would not be appropriate. 
When correctly made, it is quite ornamental. 
To Make the Chain-stitch 
1. Fasten the thread on the underside, and 
at the top of the work, and work downward. 
2. Draw the thread through to the right 
side. 
8. Hold the thread down with the thumb 
of the left hand. 
4. Place the needle again exactly where 
it was brought through, and take a short 
straight stitch downward, taking care not to 
draw the thread too tightly. 
5. Again place the needle inside of the 
loop, holding the thread down with the thumb 
of the left hand and bring it out just below the 
previous loop made, which forms another loop. Tllustration X-6 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  
  
181 Ornamental Work Lessons 246, 247 
  
6. Continue with these loop stitches. 
In the Chain-stitch the needle is always set 
straight up and down just inside the previous 
loop, and is brought out just outside of the previ- 
ous loop. On the reverse side, the appearance 
should be of uneven basting stitches. 
Lesson 246—Tur Fratuer Stircu 
(Illustration X-7) 
To make ornamental stitches of this character, 
it is best to study and practise carefully the 
Buttonhole or Loop Stitch. 
To Make the Feather Stitch 
1. Fasten the thread under the work at the 
top of the design. 
2. Then allow the thread to fall downward 
into the form of a loop, holding down the loop 
with the left thumb. 
8. To one side of where the thread came through, take a stitch 
straight up and down, holding the loop with the thumb. 
4. Just below where the thread came through, carry the thread 
across to the opposite side. Bring the thread up- 
ward, forming a loop, and hold down the loop with 
the left thumb. 
5. Take a straight stitch inside of the loop, and 
then carry the thread across to the opposite side, 
and continue in the same way. 
Should one desire the slanting effect, place the 
needle on a slant instead of on a straight line. 
In all of this kind of work the great trouble of the 
beginner is inability to keep a perfect line. 
It is then best to make a row of bastings on each 
side of where one wishes the work to appear. The 
stitches then are taken inside of these lines, and the 
work does not widen or spread out. 
  Illustration X-7 
  Lesson 247—Tue Briar Stircn 
(Illustration X-8) 
The Briar Stitch is made in the same manner as 
the Feather Stitch, except that a slant stitch is taken 
Illustration X-8 instead of the straight stitch on each side of the work.

(Illustrations X-9 and 10) 
The Double or Triple Briar 
Stitch is made exactly on the same 
principle as the Single Briar Stitch. 
The only difference is that in the 
Double Briar Stitch, two stitches 
are taken instead of one, the 
second stitch being taken outside 
of the other stitch. (Illustration

The Triple Briar Stitch has 
three stitches on each side, the 
third stitch taken outside of the 
second. (Illustration X-10.)    Illustration X-10 Illustration X-9 
Lesson 249—Fagotine (Illustration X-11) 
Fagoting is done in many ways. Its design may be very simple, as 
shown below, or it may be nearly as elaborate as drawn work. It is used 
to join ribbons, folds, bands, or braids. _ 
To Make the Plain Fagot Stitch 
1. Baste the work on thin oilcloth or stiff paper, basting the two 
edges as far apart as you wish the width of the fagoting, as the edges 
must be kept at an even distance. 
2. Bring the thread up through the edge of the fold. 
3. Draw the thread diagonally across to the opposite edge and 
hold down with the thumb of the left hand. 
4, Place the needle through the fold, bringing it out through the under 
edge of the fold, over the thread held down by left hand. Proceed to oppo- 
site side, making the 
thread fall as shown 
in the illustration. 
The Plain Fagot 
Stitch is another form 
of Buttonhole Stitch, 
except that the 
needle points in one 
direction for the first 
stitch, and in the 
opposite direction for the next stitch. Continue in the same manner.

of the stamped line. Use filling cotton of a size 
or as many strands as will give the work the 
desired effect. 
  
Lesson 252—Papp1na EmpromrEry Dersians 
AND Scaxops (Illustrations X-13 and 14) 
Padding is done with the Uneven Basting 
Stitch and the Chain-stitch. Take the short 
stitch underneath in order to give the. raised 
appearance on the right side. In padding, pad 
the centers of the scallops heavier than the edges 
or the points, and pad the center of the design 
heavier than the edges. Always 
pad in the opposite direction to 
the way the stitches will fall in 
the finished work. 
Lesson 253—BuTronHnoLine,

can in a few hours learn to do 
quite creditable embroidering.

and bottom lines of the design have been outlined and each scallop has 
been correctly padded, proceed as follows: 
1. Begin at the left-hand end of the work, or if working on a 
round piece, begin with the center of any scallop and work from left 
to right. 
2. Fasten the thread with a few running stitches along one of the 
scallops. 
3. Place the needle straight up and down over and back of 
the top line of the scallop. 
4. Hold the thread in 
the form of a loop with the 
thumb of the left hand. 
5. Bring the needle out 
through the loop and exactly 
under the bottom row of 
outline stitches. 
6. Repeat this work, 
slanting the stitches just Illustration X-14 
enough so they will come 
on a perfectly straight line on both the center and the top points of 
the scallop. 
      
Lesson 254—Soutm Emproiwery (Illustration X-13) 
To Make Solid Embroidery 
1. Stamp, draw, or transfer the design in the place desired. 
2. Follow the outline with very small running stitches. 
8. Pad the design with uneven basting stitches, working in the 
opposite direction from the way the design will be finished. (Lesson 
40.) Much of the beauty of raised solid embroidery depends upon 
proper padding and the careful outlining cf outside lines. 
4. When the padding is completed, one may carry the thread, either 
on the straight or on the slant, entirely across the leaf, petal, or line 
of the design. 
Lesson 255—Tur Overcast Eyexer (Illustration X-15)

shaping as you work. If they are oblong, slash through the center and 
shape as you work. If 
a heavy effect is desired 
pad the eyelet. 
8. The eyelet is then 
overcast. Draw the 
thread quite tightly, but 
do not let the stitches 
crowd on top of each 
other. Make all stitches 
lie flat, close and even. 
4. Fasten thethread 
on the underside with 
two or three loop stitches 
taken through the 
threads of the overcasting stitches, and not through the material. 
  Illustration X-15 
Lesson 256—TueE BurronnoLte EYELET 
When you have eyelets through which to run ribbon, and the slash 
seems too wide for overcasting to be effective, buttonhole the eyelet. 
Overcasting should not be employed if the eyelet is over 3¢-inch long 
The buttonholed eyelet is not only more durable, but will be much 
prettier for the longer eyelets, when they are used instead of beading. 
On large or long designs such as daisy designs, which are made in

overcast these eyelets, and the effect is much more satisfactory. 
Use the ordinary Loop Stitch as taught in Lesson 253.

DARNING AND PATCHING 
Lesson 260—DaARNING 
Darning is a process of weaving over worn portions. 
Review Lesson 2 on the Warp and Woof of materials. The warp 
threads are the lengthwise threads, and the woof threads are the crosswise 
threads. 
In darning, use a thread or cotton of color and texture matching the 
material as nearly as possible, and a needle much longer than is used 
in ordinary needlework. 
To Make the Darning Stitch 
1. Begin a little distance 
above the worn place and 
work downward. Follow the 
warp: threads, weaving over 
and under the woof threads. 
Carry your weave a little 
beyond the worn place. 
2. Turn and work up-

following the weave of the woof threads. Consider the lengthwise 
stitches as the warp and pass over and under these stitches and through 
any portion of the material that they may cover. When there is a hole 
in the garment, fill the hole full of darning stitches. Do not draw the 
threads too tightly. If the hole is large, baste the part to be darned over 
thin oilcloth or heavy paper before darning.

CHAPTER XII 
MATERNITY AND INFANTS’ GARMENTS 
Lesson 267—Matrernity GARMENTS 
The instructions which have been given for other garments are 
followed in making maternity garments. There is no material difference 
in the construction, but the selection of style, line, and color should be 
given special attention. The style and lines should be as up-to-date as 
possible and yet, under no circumstances, should there be tight lines or 
lines which expose the figure to any extent. The colors should always 
be subdued, yet a soft cheerful color in preference to black and somber 
grays is usually preferred. 
For the Skirt there should be either fulness at the top or plaits which 
can be easily adjusted. Most maternity skirts have an extension at the 
top in front which can be turned over inside of the belt and the front 
length let down from time to time as the figure demands. A soft elastic 
should be used for the inside belt and the regular routine for skirt making 
followed. (Lesson 304.) 
For the Waists and Coats practically any loose style may be chosen 
and made up in accordance with waist instructions (Lesson 303) and 
coat instructions (Lessons 297 and 298). 
In case a fitted lining for the waist is 
desired, make a French lining in ac- 
cordance with Lesson 305. Instead of 
stitching up the side seams, join a strip 
of material to each side of the seam 
from the shoulder to the bottom of the 
garment, cutting the strip considerably 
wider at the bottom line than at the 
top. Use a French seam 3¢ of an inch 
wide when finished. (Lesson 60.) 
Through the center of each of these 
seams work eyelets (Lesson 255) and 
then lace the garment together ex- 
actly the same as a corset, re-adjust- 
ing the size as often as necessary. 
(Illustration XII-1.) 
The Brassieres may also be laced in 
front as is the lining, altho many prefer 
to make the eyelets and extension for 
the lacing and closing under the arm; 
but this is not so convenient as the front-lacing for the expectant mother. 
  Illustration XTI-1

Lessons 268,269 American Dressmaking Step by Step 194   
  
The Underwear should be very loose, light, and comfortable. It should 
be of a style easily adjusted and should always hang from the shoulders. 
Lesson 268—Inrants’ WARDROBE 
There is usually some question as to just what garments and articles 
should be made, how many of each to make, the quality and amount of 
material to purchase, and the best methods of making the layette. 
Below is given a list of garments and articles which the average 
expectant mother will need. Of course, the woman with abundant 
means may add to the quantity and quality of each, expending hundreds 
or even thousands of dollars. On the other hand, the woman of very 
small means may be able to economize on both quality and quantity. 
A dainty, simple, serviceable, and in every way satisfactory layette can 
be purchased for a very small amount. This is especially true if the 
prospective mother is a thrifty buyer and handy with the needle. She 
can make the garments herself and finish them with dainty hand work. 
The following articles are usually found necessary, no matter what 
the circumstances of the mother may be: 
4 Dresses 4 Pinning Blankets 6 Bibs 
6 Dayslips 4 Dozen Diapers 1 Coat 
6 Nightslips 1 Diaper Cover 2 Caps or Bonnets 
3 Petticoats (flannel) 3 Flannel Bands 1 Veil 
3 Petticoats (white) 3 Shirts 2 Shawls 
2 Kimonos or Wrappers 6 Pairs Stockings 1 Carriage-robe 
2 Sacks 3 Pairs Bootees 1 Receiving Blanket 
Lesson 269—InFants’ Dresses (Illustration XII-2) 
There is probably no human experience known to the heart of a 
woman which causes quite the wonderful thrill as does the making of the 
dresses for the newcomer. 
Many women are very apt to overdo this matter, and to have the 
garments altogether too elaborate, putting much unnecessary work on 
them. While every stitch should be done by hand, the little garments 
should be just as simple as possible. The garments shown in the accom- 
panying illustrations are, all of them, desirable models. 
Any of the beautiful soft white cotton or linen materials may be used 
for the dresses. 
To Make Infants’ Dresses 
1. Buy the pattern for infants’ size, and choose a style which pleases 
you. No measurements or alterations are necessary. 
2. Fold the goods economically. (Lesson 3.) 
8. Lay on the pattern correctly. (Lesson 34.)
-P-A-G-E-205
  
195 Maternity and Infants’ Garments Lesson 269   
  
4. Mark all perforations with tailors’ 
tacks. (Lesson 34.) 
5. Mark all center lines. (Lesson 
34.) If you wish to finish any part of the 
garment with embroidery scallops, mark 
this edge with a row of colored bastings. 
6. Cut out. (Lesson 35.) Do not 
cut close to any line which is to be fin- 
ished with embroidery scallops. The 
edges are trimmed after the embroidery 
work is finished. 
7. Tf the dress has tucks make same. 
(Lesson 119.) 
8. Put in any insertion desired. 
(Lesson 227.) 
9. Make all seams. The seams will 
be either French seams (Lesson 60) or 
they will be joined with veining or seam- 
ing, using the roll seam (Lesson 63). 
10. If any portion of the garment is Illustration XII-2 
to be finished with embroidery scallops 
or embroidery design, it will now be stamped. Follow carefully instruc- 
tions on pattern for correct stamping. 
11. Embroider all scallops or designs which have been stamped. 
(Lessons 251 to 254, inclusive.) 
12. Join yoke with seaming or French seam. (Lesson 235 
or 60.) 
13. Join sleeves to garment with French seam (Lesson 60), veining 
or seaming (Lesson 235). 
14. If sleeve bands are used, make according to Lesson 99 
or 100. 
15. Make placket or closing. (Lesson 192 or 196.) 
16. If the neck is not finished with embroidery scallops, it will be 
finished with a narrow facing or bias binding. (Lesson 96 or 100.) 
17. Sew on all trimmings or edgings (Lesson 230 or 231), or you 
may feather stitch (Lesson 246) around the neck and sleeve bands. 
18. Put in the hem. You may finish with tiny hemming stitches 
(Lesson 50), or hemstitch (Lesson 236, 237, or 238), or feather stitch 
(Lesson 246). Of course if embroidery flouncing has been used for the 
garment, no hem is necessary. 
19. Sew on buttons (Lesson 214), and make buttonholes (Lesson 
207). Many women prefer to fasten the dresses with tiny gold baby- 
pins, instead of using buttons and buttonholes.

Lessons 270,271 American Dressmaking Step ty Step 196   
  
Lesson 270—Tuer Nicursties (Illustration XII-3) 
These Nightdresses will be chosen of a material depending entirely 
upon the month in which the stork is expected. For a Winter baby, 
they should be made of a first-class quality of flannel or flannelet; for 
a Summer baby, they should be made of nainsook. 
To Make the Nightslips 
Follow all of the rules for the 
making of the dress, eliminating all 
tucks and unnecessary trimmings. 
One addition, however, is made. 
Buttons are sewed on and button- 
holes made (Lessons 214 and 207) 
a few inches from the bottom of the 
flannel nightslip, so that the bottom 
edge can be folded up to keep the 
little feet from getting uncovered 
and exposed, or a draw-string may 
be run through the hem at the 
bottom. 
Lesson 271—Tue Perricoat 
(Illustration XTI-4) 
For petticoats one may use 
white nainsook or lawn or batiste, Ilustration XI1-3 
or any fine white material, and 
make them by hand in any desired style, proceeding as follows: 
1. Fold the goods economically. (Lesson 3.) 
2. Lay on the pattern correctly. (Lesson 34.) 
8. Mark all perforations with tailors’ tacks (Lesson 34), and run a 
colored thread close to any edge which is to be finished with buttonholed 
scallops. 
4. Mark all center lines. (Lesson 34.) 
5. Cut out. (Lesson 35.) Leave all edges uncut which are to be 
finished with buttonholing. 
6. Make all seams with French seams (Lesson 60), or join with 
seaming (Lesson 235). 
7. Join band or waist portion to skirt portion. (Lesson 148.) 
8. Make placket. (Lesson 192, 195, or 196.) 
9. If either the top or the bottom of the garment is to be scalloped, 
or if you wish embroidery designs, stamp the scallops or designs. 
10. Embroider all edges and designs which are stamped. (Lesson 253.) 
   
-P-A-G-E-207
  197 Maternity and Infants’ Garments _ Lesson 272     
  
11. If the top is not em- 
broidered, finish it with a narrow 
facing (Lesson 96), and then ap- 
ply the trimming (Lesson 230 or 
231). 
12. If the arm-scye is not scal- 
loped, finish with an exceptional 
facing (Lesson 98) and then whip 
on the trimming (Lesson 230 or 
231). 
13. Make buttonholes (Lesson 
207) and sew on buttons (Lesson 
214), or it may be fastened with 
tiny safety-pins. 
14. Hem. (Lesson 85.) Use 
fine hemming stitches (Lesson 49 
or 50), or hemstitch (Lesson 236, 
237, or 238). 
15. Put on the ruffles (Lesson 
124), or any trimming desired. Illustration XII-4 
  Lesson 272—FLANNEL Perricoats 
The Flannel Petticoats should be made of white flannel of as good a 
quality as the expenditure of this layette will afford, as a poor quality 
of flannel proves very unsatisfactory. But even the best of flannel 
with careless washing will grow harsh. 
To Make the Flannel Petticoat 
Fold the goods economically. (Lesson 3.) 
Lay on the pattern correctly. (Lesson 34.) 
Mark all perforations with tailors’ tacks. (Lesson 34.) 
4. Mark all center lines (Lesson 34) and run a colored thread 
around all edges to be buttonholed or scalloped. 
5. Cut out. (Lesson 35.) Do not cut close to any line which is 
to be finished with embroidery scallops, but leave the uncut material 
some distance from the line which is marked to show the edge of the 
garment. 
6. Make all seams. A plain seam (Lesson 56), feather stitched flat, 
is very satisfactory. (Lesson 246.) 
7. Stamp all edges to be buttonholed. 
8. Ifa band is used for the upper portion, make according to Lesson 
148 on bands. Instead of machine stitching the edges, they may be 
feather stitched (Lesson 246). oe ee 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
    
Lesson 273 American Dressmaking Step by Step 198   
  
9. Ifa waist portion has been made, join to the skirt portion (Lesson 
148), and finish the top with embroidered scallops (Lesson 253). 
10. Make placket or closing. (Lesson 192, 195, or 196.) Sew on 
tape to tie the closing instead of using buttons and buttonholes. 
11. Buttonhole the scallops to finish the arm-scye. (Lesson 253.) 
12. Finish the bottom with a feather stitched French hem (Lesson 
88), or buttonhole a scalloped edge. 
Lesson 273—Kimonos, WRAPPERS, AND SACKS 
(Illustrations XTI-5 and 6) 
These are usually made of flannelet, albatross, or a good quality of 
French flannel and lined with a soft silk. It is better to have a lining 
of white, so that in frequent laundering the lining will not become faded 
and old-looking. You will make the kimonos and wrappers as follows: 
Follow all of the rules for the making of the dress. 
The linings are put in by turning the edges of the garment and the 
edges of the lining together and slip stitching or finishing in any desired 
manner. 
The facings are made as is a sewed-on overfacing. (See Lesson 95 
for details for its making.) 
If the yoke is lined, apply as instructed in Lesson 163. 
The Sacks are usually cut in one piece. (If they are to be embroid- 
ered, do this work before cutting.) 
Finish with embroidery scallops (Lesson 253), or bind the edges 
with ribbon (Lesson 99 or 100), or feather stitch the edges (Lesson 246). 
If solid embroidery work is done on the sack, do all of this work before 
the lining is put in or the edges bound. 
Tf a lining is used, baste the lining and 
the outside together and scallop or bind 
them together.

Lesson 274—PINNING BLANKETS 
The Pinning Blankets are to keep the legs and lower part of the 
baby’s body warm and are dispensed with when climatic conditions 
permit. They should be made of some soft, warm material, either of 
good quality of wool or of cotton flannel. 
To Make the Pinning Blanket 
1. Fold the goods economically. (Lesson 3.) 
2. Lay on the pattern correctly. (Lesson 34.) 
8. Mark all perforations and construction marks with tailors’ tacks. 
(Lesson 34.) 
4. Mark all center lines. (Lesson 34.) 
5. Cut out. (Lesson 55.) Cut the body portion double. 
6. Make all seams. (Lesson 55.) Make plain seams on the skirt 
and press open. (Lesson 56.) 
7. Make the body portion exactly as a band is made. (Lesson 148.) 
If it is a fitted body portion, turn all edges toward each other and baste. 
It is then more desirable to feather stitch the edges together than to 
machine stitch. 
8. Slip the skirt portion between the folds of the body portion 
exactly the same as a joining band is applied. (Lesson 149.) 
9. With fine feather stitches finish-the joining. (Lesson 246.) 
10. At the left side of the body portion a slash is made through 
which to bring the ends which pass around the body. Bind this slash 
exactly as if it were a bound buttonhole. (Lesson 212.) 
11. Fold back the front edges and the bottom of the pinning blanket 
and hem (Lesson 88), or feather stitch (Lesson 246). 
Lesson 275—TueE Diapers 
The Diapers should be made of Diaper cloth, bird’s-eye cotton, or 
stockinet. The diapers should be cut 27 inches square and should be 
hemmed with a narrow hem by hand. A thread should be drawn in 
cutting so all edges are cut perfectly straight and the diaper fold even. 
The larger size diaper is more practical than the 18x36 size, as it can 
be used as long as diapers are required. 
Lesson 276—Tur Diaper Cover 
A rubber or stockinet diaper should be made for protection on occa- 
sions when you are traveling or taking the child away from home, but 
it should be removed at the earliest possible moment, as the waterproof 
  
   
-P-A-G-E-210
    
Lessons 277,278 American Dressmaking Step by Step 200   
  
diaper is not porous enough to properly let the air to the child’s body. 
The diaper covers are usually purchased ready-made. 
Lesson 277—Tur Fuannet Banp 
To Make the Flannel Band 
1. Cut a band of fine flannel, making a strip about six inches wide 
and the length of the width of the material. The flannel is always torn 
crosswise of the goods—not cut lengthwise, as are other bands. 
2. The Flannel Band is not hemmed. It may be pinked or left 
with the edges raw, as the band must have plenty of “give” and “stretch.” 
Lesson 278—TueE SHIRTS 
It is usually best to buy the shirts ready-made. They should have 
long sleeves and a high neck. . The shirts may be of all-wool, silk-and- 
wool, cotton-and-wool, linen material, or flannel, but they should be 
most carefully chosen and be only of the finest, softest texture. The 
greatest possible care must be taken in their laundering. 
If you make the little shirts yourself, make them of a good quality 
of flannel, as the nainsook or linen shirts would not be used until the 
child was at least six weeks old, even tho it came in the Summer time. 
To Make the Flannel Shirts 
1. Fold the goods economically. (Lesson 3.) 
2. Lay on the pattern correctly. (Lesson 34.) 
3. Mark all perforations with tailors’ tacks (Lesson 34), and mark 
with a row of basting threads all edges which you wish to embroider. 
4. Mark all center lines. (Lesson 34.) 
5. Cutout. (Lesson 35.) Do not cut away any of the edges which 
you wish to finish with a scalloped edging. First embroider the edges 
and then cut. 
6. Make all seams into a plain seam. (Lesson 56.) Press open 
and feather stitch flat. (Lesson 246.) 
7. If the shirt opens only part of the way down, make a placket. 
(Lesson 195.) 
8. Sew on tape for any fastenings instead of buttons and buttonholes. 
9. Stamp all edges to be buttonholed. 
10. Buttonhole around the top edge of the shirt and around the 
edges of the arm-scyes (Lesson 253), and if the shirt is open all the way 
down the garment, buttonhole the entire opening. 
11. Buttonhole the bottom edge of the shirt or turn a flat hem and 
finish with feather stitching. (Lesson 88.)

201 Maternity and Infants’ Garments Lessons 279, 280, 281   
  
Lesson 279—Tue Stockines 
It is a mistake not to put stockings on a new-born baby. The bootees 
or socks alone, leaving the little knees without this extra covering, are 
not desirable. The correctly dressed baby has the warmth equalized 
over the body. The stockings should reach high enough over the thighs 
so the knees and joints are covered. ~ ‘They should be of a very soft wool 
for Winter, and cotton-and-wool for Summer. Only white stockings 
should be put on the baby, and ribbed wool stockings seem to shrink 
less than the plain ones when washed. Whether ribbed or plain tho, 
great care must be taken in washing the stockings so they do not shrink 
or harden. 
Lesson 280—TuE Boornrs 
The Bootees are usually knit or crocheted, but may be made of the 
same material as the coat and embroidered, and eyelet worked and laced 
together with ribbons, or the edges may be bound with ribbon and tiny 
buttons sewed on and buttonholes worked, or many effective ideas worked 
out. Many mothers make little moccasins of soft white kid, embroid- 
ered in white or a delicate pink or blue, depending on the sex of the 
baby. Feather stitching (Lesson 246) makes a dainty finish, and the 
eyelets may be laced with matching ribbon. 
Lesson 281—Brss (Illustration XII-7) 
Choose any of the many styles of bibs which may please you. Cut 
them out of fine lawn or linen or pique. Finish all of the edges with 
embroidery scallops or lace, or turn a narrow hem and feather stitch. A 
quilted bib should be worn underneath.. For dress-up wear bibs of linen 
lawn or handkerchief linen are frequently selected, daintily embroidered 
_ and finished with a narrow frill of fine Valenciennes lace.

Lesson 282—Tue Coat (Illustration XII-8) * 
In planning the coat, the time of the baby’s arrival should be taken 
into consideration. ‘The Summer coat should be of a good quality pique 
for everyday wear, but a good cashmere or silk may be provided for extra 
occasions. In Winter the 
coat should be of a warm 
flannel material well inter- 
lined and of sufficient 
warmth to protect per- 
fectly. 
To Make the Infants’ Coat 
1. Buy the coat pattern 
for infants’ size. No mea- 
surements or alterations are 
necessary. 
2. Fold the goods eco- 
nomically. (Lesson 3.) 
8. Lay on the pattern 
correctly. (Lesson 34.) 
4. Mark all perfora- 
tions with tailors’ tacks. 
(Lesson 34.) 
5. Mark all center lines. 
(Lesson 34.) If you wish to 
finish any part of the gar- 
ment with embroidery scal- 
lops, mark this edge with a 
row of colored bastings. 
6. Cut out. (Lesson 
35.) Do not cut close to any 
line which is to be finished : 
with embroidery scallops. The edges are trimmed after the embroidery 
work is finished. 
7. If the coat is to be lined, cut out the lining according to the 
above instructions. 
8. Make all seams. (Lesson 56.) 
9. If any portion of the garment is to be finished with embroidery 
scallops or embroidery design, it will now be stamped. Follow carefully 
instructions on pattern for correct stamping. 
10. Embroider all designs (Lessons 251, 252, and 254) before the 
lining is put into the coat.

11. Baste the coat and cape lining into the coat and cape, keeping 
all edges and seams even. 
12. The edges of both coat and cape may be buttonholed. (Lesson 
253.) 
13. If the embroidery scallops are not desired, turn the edges of 
the coat to the edges of the lining and finish with invisible slip stitches 
(Lesson 51), or with feather stitches (Lesson 246). 
14. Or in the unlined coat one may hem the edges of both coat and 
cape, finishing with invisible slip stitches. 
15. Join sleeves to garment. (Lesson 174.) 
16. If sleeve bands are used, make according to Lesson 148. 
17. The cape may be sewed to the garment, but it is usually left 
separate. 
18. Put on the collar. (Lesson 165 or 166.) 
19. If you are buttoning the coat, sew on buttons (Lesson 214) and 
make buttonholes (Lesson 207). 
Lesson 283—Cars anp Bonnets (Illustrations XII-9 and 10) 
The Cap or Bonnet is usually cut out of the same material as the coat 
or of handkerchief linen with a silk lining. The cap or bonnet may be 
tucked, shirred, embroidered, or trim- 
med with lace, ribbon, or fur. 
The seams are joined with very narrow 
insertion, or French seams. It is better 
to have the strings of fine linen than of 
ribbon because the linen will launder. 
The ends of the 
strings may be 
hemstitched, 
tucked, or 
trimmed with 
lace. 
Rosettes 
may ‘be used 
for the sides of 
the bonnet. Illustration XIL-9 
Very pretty 
caps and bonnets may also be knit or cro- 
cheted. Fine wool or silk may be employed 
for such caps, with a lining of white China 
Tllustration XII-10 silk. If desired the ties may be attached 
to the cap with baby-pins so that they 
may be more easily removed for washing.

frequently. 
Lesson 285—Tur SHawh 
The Shawl may be knit, may be of French flannel, cashmere, albatross, 
or any of the soft materials which will afford warmth. It is made 
as follows: 
1. The shawl is usually cut double, and sometimes lined. 
2. If unlined the edges may be embroidered in scallops (Lesson 253) 
or bound with ribbon (Lesson 99 or 100). 
3. If alining is used: Baste the lining and the outside together, and 
finish exactly as if the shawl were unlined, by binding or buttonholing the 
edges together. 
If solid embroidery work is used, do all this work before the joining 
of the lining to the outside, and before the edges are buttonholed or 
bound together.

CHAPTER XIV 
TAILORING 
Lesson 297—GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR TAILORING 
To do good tailoring one must have a thorough knowledge of, and 
ability to do, the following: 
1. To alter coat, jacket, and skirt patterns until they fit perfectly. 
2. To press neatly and correctly. 
8. To do first-class machine work, keeping perfect lines. 
4. To make even, uneven, and diagonal basting cr padding stitches; 
the tailors’ tacks; invisible slip stitch, and catch stitch. 
5. To follow details correctly and carefully. 
With this foundation, generally speaking, any one can successfully 
venture into tailoring. 
Lesson 298—TatLoreD Coats AND JACKETS 
1. To prepare materials. Everything must be shrunk with the 
exception of the linings and thread. All of the garment material, unless 
it be silk or velvet, should be sponged and shrunk so that the pressing 
can be done without spotting the cloth and so that the garment will hold 
its shape when made. ‘The canvas, crinoline, bust forms, and all inter- 
linings must also be shrunk. Shrink the tape unless silk seam tape is 
used, and shrink any muslin, cotton flannel, or French flannel which 
may be used for shoulder guards. Complete instruction for the prepara- 
tion of materials will be found in Chapter II, Lesson 4. 
2. Obtain the model’s measurements. Be very exact, as a strictly 
tailored garment should conform to the lines of the body. If the measure- 
ments of either the model or the pattern are not correct good results 
can not be expected. For study of body measurements see Lesson 7. 
Obtain the measurements of the pattern. (Lessons 13, 14, and 15.) 
Figure the specifications for any necessary alterations. (Lesson 18.) 
Make any necessary alteration of pattern. (Lesson 20.) 
Fold the material correctly and economically for cutting. (Lesson 3.) 
7. Lay the pattern onto the material according to the grain and fold 
marks of the pattern and the warp of the material. (Lesson 34.) Pin 
or weight down the pattern in place. 
8. Construction marks. Mark all perforations with tailors’ tacks. 
For detailed study of tailors’ tacks see Lesson 34. Mark all center lines 
with basting stitches about 1 inch in length. With tailors’ chalk mark 
an extra margin of 1 of an inch to be left in cutting around the neck 
and arm-scyes. In pressing, these edges sometimes become stretched 
or drawn and this extra outlet is then of great value. eae ce 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  
218 Tailoring Lesson 298   
  
9. Cut out the outside of the garment using very sharp cutting 
shears. Clip every notch. For instruction in correct cutting see 
Lesson 35. Cut out only the body portion of the coat until after the 
first fitting. 
10. The Interlining. If the coat is to be interlined throughout lay 
the underside of the cut pieces of the garment over the interlining mate- 
rial and baste together with long diagonal basting stitches. (Lessons 
42 and 55.) Then cut out the interlining following the lines of the 
coat. (Illustration XTV-1.) 
French flannel, lamb’s wool, 
or cotton flannel is usually 
used for interlining and 
there are many new inter- 
linings on the market. from 
time to time. When inter- 
lining a material which has 
a nap, such as velvet or 
broadcloth, place the woolly 
part of the flannel toward 
the garment. When inter- 
lining a smooth faced mate- 
rial, such as serge or silk, 
turn the woolly part of the 
interlining toward the body 
and the smooth side toward 
the garment material. 
ll. Baste the coat to- 
gether. The side-front and 
side-back seams are usually 
basted for the fold lap 
seam. (Lesson 80.) Turn 
under the seam of the cen- 
ter-front and center-back 
portions exactly on the 
seam line. Baste. (Illus- 
tration XIV-2, A.) Baste 
the turned edge of the 
center-front and center- 
back ‘portions over the un- 
turned seam edge of the 
side-front and side-back 
portions.<.@1llas- 
tration XIV-2, B.) The Illustration XIV-1    
-P-A-G-E-224
    Lesson 298 American Dressmaking Step by Step a4 
  
edges of the turnings 
of the center portions 
must be brought ex- 
actly to the seam line 
of the side portions. 
Pin together at the 
notches and then 
baste according to in- 
structions found in 
Lesson 55. If an 
interlining is used, 
the side-front seams 
and the — side-back 
seams of the inter- 
lining are basted with 
a plain seam (Illus- 
tration XIV-3, C) 
and the side seams of 
the outside of the 
garment are basted to 
form a separate seam. 
Baste all other 
inside seams of the 
  Hiustration XIV-3 
  Illustration XIV-2 
garment into plain seams. If in- 
terlining is used, baste the under- 
arm and shoulder seams of the 
interlining and the garment to- 
gether. (Illustration XIV-3, D.) 
12. Tape the neck and arm- 
scye temporarily. _ Baste tape 
around the neck and arm-scye so 
that in trying on garment and 
handling the material these por- 
tions will not become stretched 
or out of shape. (Illustration 
XIV-4, E.) Ifinterlining is used 
it is unnecessary to tape the 
arm-scye, but baste the inter- 
lining firmly to the garment 3 
of an inch from the edge. 
13. Try on and make any
-P-A-G-E-225
  
215 Tailoring Lesson 298 
  
necessary alterations (Lesson 144), and 
then press the side seams before stitching. 
14. Stitch all seams except the shoulder 
seams. If interlining is used stitch the 
interlining seams into a plain seam and 
press open. If the fold lap seam is used 
on the side seams, stitch inch back 
from the edge of the fold (Illustration 
XIV-4, F), stitching through the inter- 
lining. 
15. Press seams. For special instruc- 
tion see Lesson 5. If the seams do not lie 
flat in pressing they should be clipped at 
frequent intervals. (Illustration XIV- 
6,G.) It is always necessary to clip the 
seams at the waist-line and on the side 
lines. 
16. Bind seams. (See Lessons 65 and 
66.) Bind the side seams together and the 
underarm seams open. (Illustration XIV- 7 
12, H.) When a lining is used it is seldom necessary to bind the seams.    Illustration XIV-4 
TO PUT IN THE BUST FOUNDATIONS OR CANVAS 
17. Cut out the canvas. If the canvas is to extend entirely across 
the chest and below the bust as well as in the fronts and revers, bust 
foundations will be needed. Beginners may use the ready-made bust 
foundations as they save an immense amount of time and labor and only 
tailors of long experience undertake the making of these foundations. 
If canvas is desired only for the fronts and revers, cut out the canvas 
using the pattern given for the front facing. If no facing pattern is 
included, cut the canvas the width desired using the pattern of the front 
of the coat. (illustration XIV-11, I.) 
18. Locate the tip of the bust of the garment and the tip of the bust 
of the canvas foundations and tack together. (Illustration XIV-4, J.) 
19. Pin in the bust foundations. Hold the canvas over the left hand. 
Draw the front of the garment tightly over the canvas, pinning smoothly. 
Never lay the bust foundations flat on the table while pinning. This 
kind of work must be done over the hand so that the work will not become 
flattened or out of shape. 
20. Baste in the bust foundations. After pinning together smoothly, 
begin at the tip of the bust on the right side of the garment and with 
long diagonal bastings baste the material to the canvas, taking care to 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  Lesson 298 American Dressmaking Step by Step 216     
  
  
  
baste always in a direction away from the tip of the bust. (Illustration 
XIV-4.) 3 
21. Mark the fold line of the revers. Use even basting stitches and 
let them show on both the canvas and the right side of the garment. 
(Illustration XIV-4, KX.) The fold line may be taped if desired. 
22. To pad the revers. (Illustration XIV-5, L.) Begin at the fold 
line 8% of an inch from the top of the rever and with small padding 
stitches taken through both canvas and material follow the line of the 
fold down to 3 of an inch of the edge of the rever. Do not work nearer 
the edge of the rever than 3¢ of an inch, because the edge of the canvas 
must be cut away. 
In padding use thread of the same color as the garment. Do all 
padding work from the canvas side. Use the padding stitch which is 
taught in Lesson 42. Let the short, straight stitches of this padding 
stitch show as little as possible on the right side 
of the garment. However, the padded portion 
comes under the rever, so the stitches will not 
show when the garment is worn. 
When the coat is to be worn with the lapels 
folded to the front so as to close at the neck, 
omit the padding of the revers. (Illustration 
XIV-12.) 
23. Trim away the edges of the canvas to 3% 
of an inch of the edge of the garment. (Illustra- 
tion XIV-5, M.) 
24. Turn the edge of the material of the gar- 
ment over the trimmed edge of the canvas and 
baste. (Illustration XIV-5, N.) 
25. Tape the front of the coat. (Illustration 
XIV-5, 0.) Use tape about 34 of an inch wide. 
Baste the tape so that it covers the raw edges of 
the material which has been turned over the 
canvas and so that the outside edge of the tape 
is 4 of an inch from the edge of the garment. 
Catch stitch the tape to the garment, catch 
stitching from edge to edge of the tape. For 
instructions how to make the catch stitch see 
Lesson 54. Remove the bastings. 
26. The shoulder guard. If the coat is not 
interlined throughout a shoulder guard is usually 
required. (Illustration XIV-5, P.) Use French 
flannel or cotton flannel for this purpose. Baste 
the flannel flat over the upper portion of the Tllustration XTV-5 
   
-P-A-G-E-227
    ait Tailoring Lesson 298   
  
coat, letting it extend over the underarm seam and from two to four 
inches below the arm-scye. ‘Then baste the flannel flat over the upper 
portion of the front of the coat, rounding over the busts and extending 
about an inch over the canvas. Cut out the shoulder guard, following 
the exact outlines of the top of the coat and rounding the back portion 
between the shoulder-blades. 
27. Join the bust foundations and the shoulder guard. Lap the edges 
of the shoulder guard over the edges of the canvas and catch stitch 
together. (Illustration XIV-5, Q.) 
28. Bind all raw edges of the canvas with the same kind of tape that 
is used for the other portions of the garment. (Illustration XIV-6, R.) 
29. Baste together the shoulder seams of the garment and the shoulder 
guards, and try on the coat. Make any necessary alterations for the 
shoulder and neck. It sometimes happens that the extra amount taken 
up by the bust foun- 
dations and the 
shoulder guards 
changes the propor- 
tions of the garment a 
trifle. Therefore the 
shoulder seam should 
not be closed until 
the garment has been 
carefully tried on 
after all interlinings 
and canvas have been 
put in. The shoul- 
der seams are then 
stitched. 
30. Pad out the 
hollows. — Should it 
happen that one has 
a sinking arm-scye or 
a hollow chest or one 
shoulder’ higher than 
the other, or any 
other defect, the gar- 
ment is not fitted into 
the hollows or de- 
fects, but the hollow 
places must be 
padded out. Use 
sheet wadding, laying 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
    
Lesson 298 American Dressmaking Step by Step ais   
  
it heavier over the hollow places and decreasing the amount of the 
padding near the edges of the hollows. (Hlustration XTV-6,S.) This 
padding should be done on the figure and the sheet wadding basted to 
the shoulder guards, not to the outside of the garment. 
THE COLLAR 
31. Make any necessary alterations in the collar pattern. (Lesson 29.) 
32. Cut out the collar (Lesson 35) and baste the collar of the material 
over the canvas and cut out the canvas. 
33. Mark the roll line of the collar using even basting stitches showing 
on both the right side of the material and the canvas. (Illustration 
XIV-7, T.) 
34. Pad the collar using the padding stitch and pad from the top of 
the collar down to the roll line. Do not pad nearer than *¢ of an inch 
from the edge of the collar. (Illustration XIV-7, U.) 
35. Cut away the 
canvas to 3% of an 
inch of the edge of the 
collar — (Illustration 
XIV-7, V) and baste 
the 3¢ of an inch mar- 
gin of the material 
over the cut edge of , 
the canvas. (IIlus- Illustration XIV-7 
tration XIV-7, W.) 
36. Tape the outer edge of collar exactly as the front of the coat is 
taped. (Illustration XIV-7, X.) 
87. Machine stitch from the roll line down to the bottom of the collar 
with rows of stitches about 3 of an inch apart, following either curves or 
diagonal lines. (Illustration XIV-7, Y.) 
38. Join the collar to the garment. Make a plain seam joining the 
neck of the collar to the neck of the garment, stretching the collar 
between the notches. (Illustration XIV-5, Z.) Cut away the canvas 
to within 1% of an inch of the seam line and clip the seam so that it will 
not draw. 
89. Join the ends of the under portion of the collar to the wpper ends of 
the revers of the coat and press the seam open. (Illustration XIV-5, Al.)

POCKETS 
41. If pockets are desired make them before the lining is put into 
the coat or before going further with the construction of the garment. 
See special instructions for pocket making. (Lesson 199 or 200.) 
APPLYING THE OVERFACING OF FRONTS, COLLARS, AND REVERS 
42. Make the facing seams. If the facing has a seam in the center- 
back of the collar, stitch the seam and press it open. If the facing of the 
collar and the facing of the re are joined with a plain seam, make the 
seam and press it open. (Illustration XTV-8, B1.) 
43. Turn all edges of the collar, revers, and fronts of the facing toward. 
the under or wrong side of the material, making the turning 34 of an 
inch wide. (Illustration XIV-8, C1.) 
Baste carefully. 
44, Baste on the overfacing. Baste 
the edges of the facing of the collar, 
revers, and fronts to the outside edges of 
the collar, revers, and fronts of the gar- 
ment. (Illustration XIV-6, D1.) 
  TURN UP THE BOTTOM OF THE COAT 
45. Try on the coat and have the 
length carefully marked. Runa thread 
on the exact line on which the coat is to 
be turned. (illustration XIV-6, E1.) 
46. Cut astay. (Illustration XIV- 
6, F1.) If the coat has a straight line at 
the lower edge use a straight strip of 
lining or canvas the width of the turn- 
ing, or tape may be used if it is the 
correct width. If the bottom of a 
coat has a circular or irregular line use 
a bias stay. 
47. Baste in the stay so that its 
lower edge comes directly to the marked line where the turning is to 
be. (Illustration XIV-6, G1.) 
48. Stitch the right side of the lower edge of the coat and the edge of 
the stay together. (Illustration XIV-6, H1.)

51. Machine stitch close to the edge entirely around the garment. (Illus- 
tration XIV-6, K1.) Press the coat after removing all unnecessary 
bastings. 
THE LINING 
52. To make the lining. Follow exactly the same steps for the 
cutting, fitting, stitching, clipping, and pressing of the lining of the 
coat which is followed for the outside portion, except that the center- 
front of the lining is cut only to about one or two inches beyond the 
facing and an extra inch allowed for turning in. The side seams of the 
lining are stitched into a plain seam. 
53. To putin the lining. Baste together the center-back of the coat 
and the lining. Baste the lining to the shoulder but leave the shoulder 
seam of the lining open. Baste the neck and the arm-scye of the lining 
and the garment smoothly together. Catch stitch the underarm seams 
of the lining to the underarm seams of the coat. 
Turn under the front edges of the lining and baste one inch over the 
front facings. Turn under the neck portion of the lining and baste so 
that it covers the entire seam of the collar, Turn under the back portion 
of the shoulder seam and bring it over the front shoulder seam of the 
lining and baste. ‘Turn under the bottom edge of the lining and baste 
Y{ of an inch from the bottom edge of the coat. Finish by catching 
the lining securely to the garment with invisible slip stitches. (Lesson 51.) 
THE SLEEVES 
54. Make any necessary alteration of the sleeve pattern. (Lesson 24.) 
55. Cut sleeves. (Lesson 35.) 
56. Baste together the seams of the sleeves. (Lesson 55.) 
57. Put in the sleeves (Lesson 174), fit, and make 
alterations. 
58. Stitch in the sleeves. Stitch the 
seams of the sleeve and then stitch the 
outside portion of the sleeve into the arm- 
scye of the garment, stitching through sleeve 
and garment, catching the lining of the gar- 
ment and any canvas that there may be. 
59. Put in the stay at the bottom of 
the. sleeve. (Illustrations XIV-9, L1 and

60. Put on the cuff, if cuff is desired. For instructions in making 
and applying cuffs to the garment see’ Lesson 180. 
61. Finish the bottom of the sleeve. ‘Turn under the lower edge of 
the lining. Slip stitch the 
bottom of the sleeve lining to 
the bottom of the sleeve. 
Catch stitch together the front 
seam of the sleeve and the 
front seam of the lining. 
62. Finish the arm-scye of 
the garment. Turn under the 
upper portion of the lining of 
the sleeve. Bring the lining 
over the seam of the arm-scye 
and finish with the Invisible 
Slip Stitch. (Lesson 51.) 
63. Press the entire gar- Illustration XTV-10 
ment. 
64. If loops are not used, make buttonholes (Lesson 211), and sew on 
the buttons (Lesson 214.) 
  Lesson 299—Linep AND UNLINED, SEMITAILORED, AND Urimiry Coats 
AND JACKETS 
1. Prepare materials for tailoring. (Lesson 4.) 
All of the garment material, unless it is silk or velvet, should be 
sponged and shrunk so that the pressing can be done without spotting 
the material, and so that the garment will hold its shape. The canvas, 
crinoline, and tape (unless silk tape is used) must also be shrunk. 
2. Obtain the model’s measurements. (Chapter III.) 
3. Learn the pattern’s measurements. (Lesson 11.) 
4. Figure the specifications for any necessary alterations. (Lesson 18.) 
5. Make any necessary alterations on the pattern. (Lesson 19.) 
6. Fold the material correctly and economically for cutting. (Lesson 3.) 
7. Lay on the pattern according to the grain and fold marks, follow- 
ing warp of material. (Lesson 34.) Pin or weight down pattern. 
8. Construction marks. Make tailors’ tacks through all perforations 
and mark all center lines. (Lesson 34.) With tailors’ chalk mark 4 
of an inch margin around the neck and arm-scyes. This extra margin 
is to be left in cutting because in pressing and fitting the edges sometimes 
become stretched or drawn. 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  Lesson 299 American Dressmaking Step by Step 222 
9. Cut out the garment using very sharp shears. Clip every notch. 
(Lesson 35.) 
10. Baste the coat together. When a utility or semitailored coat 
has side-front or side-back seams they are usually basted for the fold 
lap seam. Follow the detailed instruction for basting these seams as 
given in Lesson 298, step No. 11. 
In semitailored silk, velvet, or dressy coats and jackets the side-front 
and side-back seams are usually basted with a plain seam, so that no 
stitching appears on the right side of the finished garment. 
Baste all other seams (Lesson 55) inside of the garment into a plain 
seam. (Lesson 56.) 
11. Try on and make any necessary alterations. (Lesson 144.) 
12. Stitch all seams except the shoulder seams. If fold lap seams 
are used on the side-front and side-back lines, stitch 14 of an inch back 
from the edge of the fold. 
13. . Press the side seams together and press open the underarm seams. 
(Lesson 5.) Clip the seams at frequent intervals so they will be flat 
and smooth. 
14. Bind seams. Bind the side seams together (Lesson 66), and the 
underarm seams open (Lesson 65). Do not bind the seams if the garment 
is to be lined throughout. 
15. Canvas or crinoline interlining. It is not always necessary to 
interline the collar, revers, and fronts with canvas or crinoline. ‘This 
is determined by the material used and the style of the garment. If the 
interlining is used, cut out the canvas or crinoline for the fronts and 
revers, using the pattern for the front facing of the coat. If no pattern 
for the facing is included, use the pattern of the front of the coat. Cut 
the interlining the width desired and reaching from the shoulder to the 
bottom of the coat. (Illustration XIV-11, I.) 
16. If stitching is desired on the outside edge of the finished garment, 
baste the interlining to the fronts of the garment and to the revers, 
and continue as directed in steps 21 to 25, inclusive, of tailoring. 
(Lesson 298.) 
If no stitching is desired on the outside edge of the finished gar- 
ment, mark the roll line as directed in step 21, Lesson 298, and if the 
revers are to be padded continue in accordance with the instructions 
given in step 22, Lesson 298. Revers are not padded in garments where 
the lapels are sometimes to be worn brought forward and closed to the 
neck. Neither are the revers padded in silk, satin, or velvet coats or 
jackets. 
Then after the revers have been padded tape the edge of the fronts 
and revers, catch stitching the tape so that the outside edge of the tape 
is 4 of an inch from the edge of the garment. (Illustration XIV-5, O.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  
  
228 Tailoring : Lesson 299   
  
17. Baste up the 
shoulder seams and 
try on the garment. 
Make any necessary 
alterations for the 
shoulder and neck. 
18. Stitch the 
shoulder seams and if 
the coat is to be un- 
lined bind the seams. 
(Lessons 65 and 66.) 
PREPARE THE 
COLLAR 
19. Make any 
necessary alterations 
on the collar pattern. 
(Lesson 29.) 
20. Cut out the 
under portion of the 
collar. (Lesson 35.) 
21. If machine 
stitching on the outer 
edge of the collar is 
desired and inter- 
lining is used, cut, 
pad, and tape the 
collar and stitch up Illustration XIV-11 
to the roll line ac- 
cording to instructions given in steps 33 to 36, inclusive, of Lesson 298. 
If no stitching is desired on the outside edge of the finished collar, follow 
steps 32, 33, 34, and 37 of Lesson 298. 
Then catch stitch tape 14 of an inch from the outside edge of the 
collar... It is not always necessary to interline the collar, but whenever 
canvas or crinoline is used tape is also used. 
If interlining is not used prepare exactly as for a lined collar. (Les- 
son 166.) 
22. Join the collar to the garment. Make a plain seam, joining 
the neck of the collar to the neck of the garment, clipping and stretching 
the collar between the notches to fit the neck of the garment and the 
model. 
23. Join the ends of the under portion of the collar to the upper ends 
of the revers of the coat and press the seam open. 
    
   
-P-A-G-E-234
    
Lesson 299 American Dressmaking Step by Step 224   
  
24. If loops are used for fasteners instead of buttonholes, the loops 
are next made and sewed to the canvas and to the taped portion of the 
garment. 
OVERFACING OF THE FRONTS, COLLAR, AND REVERS 
25. Lf stitching is 
to be used to finish the 
outside edges of the 
coat prepare and put 
on the overfacing as 
directed in steps 42, 
43, and 44 of Lesson 
298. 
If no stitching is 
desired on the finished 
edges of the garment 
follow step 42. 
Then baste the 
right side of the fac- 
ing to the right side 
of the garment and 
stitch together with 
a 3 of an inch seam. 
(Illustration XTV-12, 
N1.) 
Trim the edges of 
the seam down to the 
width of \% of an 
inch. (Illustration 
XIV-12, O1.) 
Turn the facing to 
the underside of gar- 
ment and baste down 
carefully. (Illustra- 
tion XIV-13, P1.) 
Press the edges of 
the coat until they 
are perfectly flat. 
When no inter- 
lining is used, put on 
the overfacing   Illustration XIV-12
-P-A-G-E-235
    
225 Tailoring Lesson 299   
  
exactly the same as a sewed-on overfacing. (Lesson 95.) The edges 
may then be stitched or not as is preferred. 
26. Bind the raw edges. If the coat is unlined, bind the inside edges 
of the front facing and canvas together and bind the neck portion of the 
overfacing. Slip stitch with invisible slip stitches the overfacing of the 
collar over the seam at the neck of the garment. (Illustration XIV-13, Q1.)

SLEEVES 
30... For the cutting, fitting, and making of sleeves follow instructions 
given in steps 54 to 60, of Lesson 298. 
Tf the sleeve is to be lined continue with steps 61 and 62. 
If the sleeve is unlined hem the bottom of the sleeve, finishing with 
invisible slip stitches or finish with a bias sewed-on facing (Lesson 95), 
and finish the arm-scyes by binding (Lesson 177). 
31. Press the entire garment. 
32. If loops are not used, make buttonholes (Lesson 212) and sew on 
the buttons (Lesson 214). 
Lesson 300—Boys’ Norro.k JACKET 
1. To prepare materials for tailoring. Everything must be shrunk 
with the exception of the linings and thread. All of the garment material 
should be sponged and shrunk so that the pressing can be done without 
spotting the material, and so the garment will hold its shape. The 
canvas and all interlinings must also be shrunk. 
2. Obtain the boy’s measurements. (Lesson 8.) 
3. Learn the pattern’s measurements. (Lesson 12.) 
4. Figure the specifications for any necessary alteration. (Lesson 18.) 
5. Make any necessary alterations on the pattern. (Lesson 33.) 
6. Fold the material correctly and economically for cutting. (Lesson 3.) 
7. Lay on the pattern according to the grain and fold marks of 
pattern, following the warp of the material. (Lesson 34.) Pin or weight 
down the pattern with objects heavy enough to hold it in its proper place. 
8. Construction marks. Mark with tailors’ tacks all perforations 
and mark all center lines. (Lesson 34.) Mark around all of the outside 
edges of the pattern with tailors’ chalk. Leave 14 of an inch extra 
margin around the neck and arm-scyes. In pressing the edges sometimes 
become shrunk or drawn, and this extra outlet is then of great value. 
9. Cut out the outside material, using very sharp scissors. (Lesson 35.)

14. Stitch all seams. 
15. Press seams. (Lesson 5.) 
16. Put in canvas. Cut out the canvas for the fronts, revers, and 
collar. Cut the canvas after the pattern for the front facing, which 
will include the rever portion. If no pattern for the facing is included, 
cut the canvas the width desired from the pattern of the front of the coat. 
17. Baste in the canvas. 
18. Either continue with the method found in Lesson 298, or érim 
away the edges of the canvas or crinoline until their edges are 24 of an 
inch from the edge of the garment. (Illustration XIV-5, M.) 
19. Turn the edges of the material of the garment over the edges of 
the canvas, and baste. (Illustration XIV-5, N.) 
20. Tape the neck and arm-scye temporarily. Baste tape around 
the neck and arm-scye, so in trying on the garment and handling the 
material it will not become stretched and out of shape.  (Hlustration 
XIV-4, E.) 
21. Tape the front of the jacket. (Illustration XIV-5, O.) Use tape 
about 34 of an inch wide, 
and if of cotton or linen, 
see that it is thoroughly 
shrunk. Baste the tape 
so that it covers the raw 
edges of the canvas and 
so the outside edge of the 
tape is 1 of an inch from 
the edge of the garment. 
Catch stitch the tape to 
the garment. Continue 
this taping all the way to 
the bottom of the garment, 
or use method as found in 
Lesson 299.

23. Cut out collar (Lesson 35), and baste the collar of the material 
over the canvas and cut. 
24. Pad the collar. Use the padding stitch in the collar from the 
outside edge down to the roll line, being careful that none of the work 
is done nearer to the edge of the garment than 3 of an inch.  (Illustra- 
tion XIV-7, U.) 
25. Cut away the canvas up to 3% of an inch from the edge of the collar 
(Illustration XIV-7, V), and baste the 3 of an inch margin of the mate- 
rial over the cut edge of the canvas. (Illustration XIV-7, W.) 
26. Tape the collar exactly as you taped the fronts of the jacket. 
(Illustration XIV-7, X.) 
27. Stitch up the roll line. Begin at the bottom of the collar and 
stitch the canvas and under portion of the collar, carrying the stitching 
back and forth either in curves or diagonal lines. (Illustration XIV-7, Y.) 
28. Join the ends of the under portion of the collar to the upper ends of 
the revers of the coat and press the seam open. (Illustration XTV-5, A1.) 
29. Join the collar to the garment. Make a plain seam joining the 
neck of the collar to the neck of the garment, clipping and stretching 
the collar between the notches to fit the neck of the garment and the 
model. (Illustration XIV-5, Z.) 
POCKETS 
30. Make the pockets, if pockets are desired, before the lining is put in- 
to the jacket or before going further with the construction of the garment. 
See special instructions for pocket making. (Lesson 199, 200, or 203.) 
OVERFACINGS OF FRONTS, COLLAR, AND REVERS 
31. Make the facing seams. (Illustration XIV-8, B1.) If the facing 
has a seam in the center-back of the collar, stitch the seam and press 
it open. 
If facing of the collar and of the revers or lapels join, stitch the seam 
and press. 
32. Turn all edges of the coilar, revers, and fronts of the facing toward 
the wrong side of the material, making the turning 3 of an inch wide. 
(Illustration XIV-8, C1.) Baste carefully. 
33. Baste on the overfacing. Baste the edges of the facing of the 
collar, revers, and fronts to the outside edges of the collar, revers, and 
fronts of the garment. (Illustration XIV-6 D1.) 
34. Pad out the hollows. Use sheet wadding, laying it heavier over 
the hollow places and decreasing the amount of the padding near the 
edges of the hollow. (Ilustration XIV-6,S.) This padding should be 
done on the figure, and used only when necessary.

tration XTV-6, 11.) 
37. Press the entire garment. 
FOR THE LINING OF THE JACKET 
38. To make the lining. Follow exactly the same steps for the 
cutting, fitting, and construction of the lining of the jacket which are 
followed for the outside of the jacket, except that ‘the center-front of the 
lining is cut only about one or two inches beyond the facing. 
39. To put in the lining, baste together the center-backs, the shoulder, 
neck, and the arm-scye of the garment and lining, turning the inside 
seams of the lining toward the inside seams of the jacket. Leave the 
shoulder seams of the lining open. 
40. To finish the edges of the lining. Turn under the outside edges 
of the lining, bringing it one inch over the front facing and covering the 
seams of the collar. Use the Invisible Slip Stitch (Lesson 51), and catch 
the lining and garment securely together. 
Turn under the bottom edge of the lining up to 44 of an inch to 1 inch 
from the bottom edge of-the outside of the jacket, and finish with the 
Invisible Slip Stitch.

4. Obtain the specifications for fitting. (Lesson 18.) 
5. Make any necessary alterations on the pattern (Lesson 33), or 
make up the trousers from cheap muslin, calico, or old material and then 
when perfectly fitted, rip the pieces apart and use for a pattern. The 
garment requires so little material that the latter method is usually 
preferred in order to insure a perfect and easy fit. 
6. Fold the material correctly and economically. (Lesson 3.) 
7. Lay on the pattern, according to the grain and fold marks of the 
pattern, following the warp of the material. (Lesson 34.) 
8. Put in construction marks. Make the tailors’ tacks and mark all 
center lines. (Lesson 34.) 
9. Cutout. (Lesson 35.) 
10. If alining is desired, lay each piece of the outside portion of the 
garment over the lining material, baste together and finish exactly the 
same as if it were double-faced material. 
11. Make the darts. If the back of the 
trousers has darts, baste and stitch them in. 
Cut open the dart and press flat. 
12. Make a slash pocket at the back over 
the right hip, and if a front pocket is desired, 
make a slash pocket just below the waist band 
and about two inches from the side seam. 
(Lesson 199.) 
THE FLY 
13. Apply facing for the upper portion of the 
fly. (Illustration XIV-15, A.) Cut the fly 
facing and lining material and sew on, follow- 
ing all of the rules for the sewed-on under- 
facing (Lesson 95), taking great care that the 
facing is stitched 14 of an inch from the seam 
line and drawn under 1% of an inch from the 
seam line. si 
14. Line the upper portion of the fly. Cut Illustration XIV-15 
a strip of lining the exact shape of the fly piece; 
turn the edges of the facing and the edges of the fly together and stitch.

CHAPTER XV 
STEPS IN GARMENT MAKING 
Lesson 303—Rovutine or Maxine a Waist 
Generally speaking, the same method of procedure is followed in 
making all styles of waists. The following is a very satisfactory schedule 
from which to work. 
The Lining 
If the waist has a lining, cut, fit, make, and finish the lining first. 
For complete instructions see Lesson 305. 
To Make Outside Portion of Waist (Illustrations XV-1, 2, and 3) 
1. Have the body measurements taken correctly. 
In taking the measurements for a waist one needs all of the measure-. 
ments for the upper portion of the body. (Lesson 7.) 
2. Obtain the pattern’s measurements. (Lessons 11 to 17 inclusive.) 
In measuring the waist pattern, consider the measurements only of 
such lines of the pattern as are complete. For instance: In a loose 
waist there is no tip of the bust point. In an evening waist there are 
no complete center-front or center-back lines. Therefore, in both cases 
the side lines of the pattern will be the principal line to measure to, 
and gage the lengths from. 
8. Figure the specifi- 
cations for fitting. (Les- 
son 18.) 
To allow for the blouse, 
if a blouse is desired, be 
sure that the pattern mea- 
sures longer than the 
model’s actual lengthwise 
waist measurements. 
4. Make any neces- 
sary alterations on the pat- 
tern. (Lesson 20.) 
5. Fold the goods cor- 
rectly and economically. 
(Lesson 8.) 
6.. Lay the pattern on 
the material correctly. 
(Lesson 34.) 
  Illustration XV-1 
   
 
-P-A-G-E-244
    
Lesson 303 American Dressmaking Step by Step 234   
fis Mark all perforations and con- 
struction marks with tailors’ tacks. 
(Lesson 34.) 
8. Mark all center lines. (Lesson 
34.) 
9. Cut out the body portion of 
the waist. (Lesson 35.) 
Do not cut out the sleeves or collar 
until the body portion has been fitted 
and any necessary alterations made and 
the seams finished, unless it be a kimono 
or drop sleeve. In this instance, make 
any alterations necessary in accord- 
ance with instructions for altering 
kimono sleeve pattern. (Lesson 26.) 
Or if the collar, revers, and vest are all 
in one piece, then the collar also must 
be altered (Lesson 29) and cut out. 
10. Baste in tucks if any. (Lesson 113.) 
11. If the waist has a yoke, baste on the yoke. (Lesson 163 or 
164.) 
12. If the garment has a vest, baste in the vest. (Lesson 161 
or 162.) 
13. Baste all seams. (Lesson 55.) 
14. If the garment is to be fitted into a belt at the waist-line, 
prepare it for hanging (Lesson 140) and 
prepare the temporary belt. (Lesson 142.) 
15. If the garment has a lining, do all of 
the draping onto the lining instead of the 
belt. If the waist has no lining, hang the 
waist to a temporary belt. (Lesson 143.) 
16. Make any necessary alterations (Les- 
son 145), and if a temporary belt is used, re- 
move same. (Lesson 146.) 
17. Stitch all plaits or tucks. (Lesson 113.) 
18. Finish all seams. 
19. Put on any ruffles or frills. (Lesson 
124.) 
20. Face or hem the fronts, whichev 
the pattern allowance indicates. (Lesson 95 
or 85.) 
21. Finish the vest. (Lesson 161 or 
162.) Illustration XV-3

son 149), or casing (Lesson 153), or attach the waist to another garment 
with a joining belt (Lesson 149). The bottom edges of a lined waist 
are bound (Lesson 159) or hemmed (Lesson 85). 
24. Make buttonholes (Lesson 207) and sew on the buttons (Lesson 
214), or finish with hooks and eyes (Lesson 215), or snap fasteners, or

41. Apply any desired trimming. 
42. Put on hangers. 
Lesson 304—Rovutine or Maxine A Skirt 
(Illustrations XV-4 and 5) 
Practically all skirts are made according to a well formulated, closely 
followed routine. The following guide will prove of value, as each 
step has been carefully explained in detail in the lessons given for 
reference. 
If a skirt has a foundation, the foundation may be cut, fitted, and 
made according to directions given below, and afterward the outside 
of the skirt can be made.

Lesson 309—Rovutine or Maxine A Corset-cover (Illustration XV-10) 
1. Have the correct measurements taken. (Lesson 7.) 
In taking the measurements for a corset-cover one needs: 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) The bust measure. 
The waist-line measurement. 
The side-front measure. 
The side-back measure. 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  Lesson 309 American Dressmaking Step by Step. 240   
  
2. Learn the pattern’s measurements. 
(Lessons 11 to 13.) 
In measuring the corset-cover pattern one 
considers measurements only of the Bust, 
which the pattern-makers will state the size of. 
The Waist measure, which the pattern- 
makers will state the size of. 
The Side-front measure, measured from 
the center of the shoulder line on a direct 
line to the waist. 
The Side-back line, measured from the 
center of the shoulder on a direct line to the 
waist. 
We have no tip of the bust or shoulder- 
blade lines unless there are darts or fitted 
seams. In this instance, take all the measure- 
inents exactly as for a tight waist. (Lesson 
305.) The underarm line of the corset-cover 
being low makes the underarm measurement a 
very unreliable one to depend upon for the 
fitting of the pattern. Therefore, in the ab- 
sence of only partial lengths of center-front and 
center-back lines and underarm lines, one 
must depend upon the side-front and side-back 
lines for fitting. 
8. Figure the specifications for the fitting of the pattern. (Lesson 
.8.) 
To take care of the blouse, if a blouse is desired, be sure that the 
pattern measures 2 inches longer than the model’s measurements. 
4. Make any necessary alterations on the pattern. (Lesson 23.) 
The pattern should be large enough to allow for both shrinkage and 
freedom, as there is nothing more uncomfortable in wearing apparel 
than an undergarment which is too tight.

14. Make any necessary alterations. (Lesson 145.) 
15. French-seam all seams. (Lesson 60.) 
16. Face or hem the fronts, whichever the pattern allowance indi- 
cates. (Lesson 95 or 85.) 
17. Face the arm-scye with the exceptional facing. (Lesson 98.) 
18. If the top of the corset-cover is loose fitting, whip on the lace, in- 
sertion, or beading, using a roll hem. (Lessons 91 and 230.) 
If embroidery edging is put on: 
(a) Turn the top edge of the corset-cover over to the right side of 
the garment and baste flat. No seam or raw edges should show on 
the underside. 
(b) Baste the embroidery trimming over the turned edge of the 
corset-cover. 
(ce) Cover with beading, insertion, or trimming braid the edge where 
the embroidery trimming is applied. 
If the top of the corset-cover has a full edge and one wishes to draw 
up the fulness with beading, whip the beading on to the edge of the 
garment. (Lesson 230.) 
If the beading or the insertion is to come down as a yoke on the corset- 
cover, apply a narrow facing on the garment (Lesson 95 or 96), then 
whip on the insertion or beading (Lesson 53). 
19. Finish the bottom of the corset-cover in any desired manner. It 
may be finished with a band (Lesson 148), peplum (Lesson 154 or 
155), draw-string (Lesson 152), beading (Lesson 157 or 158), or casing 
(Lesson 152), or one may attach the corset-cover to another garment 
with a joining belt (Lesson 149). 
20. Make buttonholes (Lesson 
207) and sew on the buttons (Les- 
son 214).

ming is applied. (Lesson 230.) 
15. Finish the closing with either a hem or a facing (Lesson 85 or 
95), whichever the pattern has allowed. If a laced closing is desired, 
face the edges and make eyelets (Lesson 255), through which to run 
the lacing.

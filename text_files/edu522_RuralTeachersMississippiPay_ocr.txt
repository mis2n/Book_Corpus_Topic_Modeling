CHAPTER I 
THE PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE STUDY 
The inequality of educational opportunity in the United 
States is nowhere more in evidence than in the contrast be- 
tween that afforded the urban child and that afforded the 
rural child. - The concentration of wealth in corporate bod- 
ies makes the taxes levied in cities for the support of edu- 
cation in large part indirect. In the rural community the 
school tax is direct. The farmer is not willing to pay high 
costs for schools unless he can see a direct value being re- 
turned. The teacher stands to him as a representative of 
what education can do for his boys and girls. Hence, the 
quality of rural education depends far more upon the qual- 
ity of the teacher than does urban education. In general, 
the quality of any product is in proportion to the amount 
paid for it. This may be said to be true in regard to the 
rural teacher. If his salary is low, is his quality also low? 
In fixing his salary, what traits is society consciously and 
unconsciously seeking? We know and can measure some 
of these traits; others are known, but as yet unmeasured ; 
still others are both unknown and unmeasured. 
When the traits that affect the pay of the rural teacher 
have been ascertained, it will be possible to find the effect 
of each. With the effect known, the proper treatment may 
be applied that will result in a general improvement of rural 
salaries. It is in the hope of making a beginning along this 
line that this study was undertaken. 
Coffman! made an exhaustive study of the social compo- 
sition of the teaching population, in which he gathered data 
in regard to the training, experience, age, pay, et cetera, of 
rural, town, and city teachers in twenty-two states. Foght? 
collected data from most of the states in regard to sex, expe- 
rience, salary, and preparation of rural teachers. Various 
state surveys which included the rural schools have been 
made, notably Washington,*? Wyoming,t Arizona,® South 
Dakota,® and Nebraska.‘ Each of these studies is of great 
value and has done much to point the way to the solution 
of the rural school problem. In each, however, the data

were more objective than subjective, the individual equa- 
tion of the teacher being scarcely touched. 
The caption of this study, ‘What is the Relation of the 
Academic Preparation, Experience, Intelligence, Achieve- 
ment, and Sex of Rural Teachers in Mississippi to Their 
Pay?” is intended to suggest its content. No claim is made 
that all of the factors entering into pay are considered, 
though it will be shown in Chapter IV that those included 
make up a significant number of them. What the others 
may be and the respective influence of each must be left for 
subsequent studies. 
Intelligence tests are in wide use in dealing with children. 
They seem to have won their place as diagnostic and prog- 
nostic instruments in the hands of the trained school admin- 
istrator. Their use in connection with the selection of 
teachers has been practically neglected, though experience 
with them in the army should indicate their applicability. 
One investigator states that “given enough intelligence to 
get through high school and two years of normal school, 
more does not function in a practical situation.”! There 
is a possibility that he is right, but 66 per cent of the teach- 
ers? of the United States do not meet the requirement speci- 
fied. Many normal schools are establishing their own 
norms? for future application to entrants, but it is still pos- 
sible to become a teacher in thirty-five states without at- 
tending a normal.’ Hence, an intelligence norm is needed 
below which no one should be permitted to attempt teaching. 
Achievement tests are also in wide use with school chil- 
dren, and have proven their value to such an extent that the 
methods involved in their construction are beginning to be 
applied to remodel the time-worn examination questions. 
Teachers, however, still take the examinations made up from 
the questions given years ago and by industrious cramming 
secure a certificate. How do such teachers score when 
given the same tests that they are urged to give their pu- 
pils? The results are interesting and suggest some new 
problems for solution. 
This investigation has undertaken to determine (1) 
whether practice takes into consideration in fixing the sal- 
ary paid the rural teacher his academic preparation, expe- 
rience, intelligence, achievement, and sex; (2) to arrive at 
a tentative minimum intelligence norm for rural teachers; 
(3) to determine the relative intelligence of those teachers

who persist in the rural schools; (4) to ascertain whether 
the quality of the rural teacher as shown by intelligence and 
achievement is improving; and (5) to make a comparison 
of the male and female rural teacher. 
The nature of the data requires that their treatment be 
statistical. The raw data will be first considered, after 
which the relationships of the various items will be ascer- 
tained. As practically all of the traits dealt with in edu- 
cation are complex and have interdependence—such as 
training, intelligence, and achievement—partial correla- 
tions will be used to hold some factors constant while the 
relationship of the others are found. In order to be cer- 
tain that the items included in this study were not negligi- 
ble factors in the pay of a teacher, multiple correlation was 
resorted to. 
The conclusions arrived at in this study are limited to 
the “universe” from which the sampling was taken, and the 
figures and rates given, based on regression coefficients, ap- 
ply only within the limits of this study.

CHAPTER II 
METHODS USED TO OBTAIN THE DATA 
A teacher who obtains a first-grade certificate in Missis- 
sippi is permitted to renew it yearly by attending a normal 
for six weeks and passing satisfactorily certain required 
courses. After teaching on such certificate for five years, 
it becomes a permanent one, and the teacher is exempt from 
further examination. 
As one Normal College does not have adequate facilities 
for taking care of all those desiring to attend, local normals 
are established each summer at various places in the state. 
These normals are under the supervision of the State De- 
partment of Education, and give as far as possible the same 
courses that are given at the Normal College. 
During the summer of 1921 there were fourteen of these 
provisional normals in operation. They were located! at 
Aberdeen, Benton, Clinton, College Hill, Corinth, Jackson, 
Meadville, Mendenhall, Meridian, Mize, New Albany, Slay- 
den, Summit, and Wesson. Only one large section, known 
as the “Delta,’’ had no normal located in it, as practically 
all of the teachers in this section come from counties out- 
side of it. 
Three thousand rural teachers were enrolled in these 
fourteen provisional normals and the Normal College (Hat- 
tiesburg) during the summer of 1921. Every county in the 
state except one was represented by one or more teachers. 
The exception is a county with a very small white popula- 
tion and employs only eighteen white teachers, practically 
all of whom are drawn from other counties. 
A supply of questionnaires was sent to the directors of 
the summer normals, with instructions to have every teacher 
fill out one at the time of registration. On account of the 
unprecedented enrollment the supply of blanks was inade- 
quate, and they were filled out by only 2,194 teachers. 
The ten largest normals—Aberdeen, Clinton, College Hill, 
Corinth, Jackson, Hattiesburg, Meridian, New Albany, 
Slayden, and Wesson—were visited. At each the teachers 
were gathered into one large assembly room and given the 
Woody-McCall Mixed Fundamentals Test, Form 2; the Otis 
Intelligence Test, Advanced Examination, Forms A or B; 
and the Monroe Silent Reading Test No. 3, Form 2. 
Before each test was given an explanation was made to 
the teachers as to its purpose. It was expected that as a   
  
‘These normals were open to white teachers only. Similar ones are held for the 
negro teachers, several of which were in the Delta.

result of taking the tests the teachers would become inter- 
ested in them, learn more about their use, and try them out 
in their own schools the following session. 
The time limit on the Woody-McCall test was reduced to 
ten minutes, as previous experience in giving that test had 
indicated that practically all of the children taking it had 
completed the work inside that limit. The papers written 
by the teachers showed that their scores were due to lack of 
accuracy rather than lack of time. 
At Corinth it was necessary to divide the teachers into 
two groups on account of the lack of seating capacity. In 
order to comply with some local arrangements, it was nec- 
essary to curtail the time of the Otis test for the second 
group, which contained seventy-five teachers. This was 
done by omitting sections one and ten of the test. The 
scores were then transmuted according to the table given 
by Dr. Otis. (Manual for 1920.) Other than as sug- 
gested, the exact time limits were observed and full direc- 
tions for giving and scoring each test were carried out. 
The examiners! were experienced in the work, and the 
teachers were in most cases anxious to try out the tests. 
As has been stated, the questionnaire was filled out by 
2,194 teachers. A few of the blanks were illegible, a few 
so incomplete as to be worthless. These, together with 
those filled out by individuals who could not be classified 
as rural teachers, were set aside. Altogether, 2,066 of 
these questionnaires were worked up. 
Several failed to put their names on the Otis booklet, and 
a few quit after trying three or four tests. Altogether, 
1,759 of these booklets were scored. 
In the same way there were discrepancies among the 
reading and arithmetic papers that necessitated the discard- 
ing of some. The final tabulation showed 1,575 arithmetic 
scores and 1,472 reading scores. 
When the questionnaires were checked with the tests, it 
was found that there were 1,265 teachers for whom there 
was a questionnaire and intelligence booklet; 966 of them 
had an arithmetic score, and 910 had reading scores. The 
tables in the following chapters are based upon these teach- 
ers.   
1The arithmetic and reading tests were given by J. T. Calhoun, Supervisor of Rural 
Schools for Mississippi.

‘CHAPTER III 
EXPOSITION OF THE DATA 
The data gathered as indicated in Chapter II naturally 
fall into five groups: (1) academic preparation, (2) teach- 
ing experience, (3) intelligence, (4) achievement, (5) pay. 
They will be taken up in that order. 
1. Academic Preparation. 
The standard of preparation set for the rural teacher by 
the United States Bureau of Education! is graduation from 
a four-year high school, with two additional years in a nor- 
mal school. That he falls short of this standard has been 
shown in practically every survey made.2 That he is no 
exception in this regard in Mississippi is shown in the fol- 
lowing table:

  EXPLANATION OF TABLE I 
The first column shows the grade in school or class in col- 
lege which was completed. Column two shows the num- 
ber of experienced female teachers who completed the grade 
or class indicated in the corresponding row of column one. 
For example, 14 female teachers had completed the senior 
year in college. At the bottom of the table are shown the 
75, 50, and 25 percentiles and Q the semi-interquartile 
range. The graph below the table shows the comparison 
between the male and female teachers by percentages. 
The range of preparation is from the eighth grade 
through the senior year in college, with the mode at the 
eleventh grade. From the graph it is readily seen that 
the high schools are producing the rural teachers, as 50 
per cent of the entire number come from the three and four- 
year schools. The percentage who have completed the ele- 
mentary grades only is too large (3 per cent), and will prob- 
ably lose ground rapidly, as many of these teachers obtained 
their certificates during the war or were in the ranks be- 
fore the certificate requirements were increased in 1916. 
That 21 per cent of these teachers have had some college 
training may be attributed to the rapid spread of consolida- 
tion, which tends to hold such teachers in the rural school 
instead of seeking the towns, as they did before it began. 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 Mississippi Rural Teachers 
The predominance of those with sophomore college train- 
ing is probably due to the influence of the Normal College, 
as its diploma graduates were given that rating. 
A comparison of the experienced female teacher with the 
novice (a novice is one having a certificate to teach, but 
without teaching experience) shows that there is an in- 
crease in the amount of academic training on the part of the 
latter. The semi-interquartile range is also smaller with 
the novices, which, taken into consideration with the 25 
percentile, shows that the incoming female teacher has had 
more schooling than her predecessor. 
The same comparison with the male teachers shows that 
the experienced ones have had more training than the nov- 
ices, though Q is again smaller for the novices, which indi- 
cates that there is a tendency toward increase in the amount 
of schooling before attempting to teach. 
There seems to be very little difference in the preparation 
of the novice males and females; but the experienced males 
seem to have had more training than the females, this dif- 
ference appearing chiefly in the upper quartile. This may 
be due to higher requirements being demanded of principals 
of consolidated schools, who are generally men. Coffman! 
found that women in the rural schools had had, on an aver- 
age, one more year of training than the men. 
Grouping the experienced teachers and comparing them 
with the novices indicates that the median novice has re- 
ceived approximately one-fourth of a year (two months) 
more training than the median experienced teacher.2 This 
might be taken as an indication that the quality of aca- 
demic preparation is gradually approaching the national 
standard, but the question arises: ““May not the increase 
be due to the better prepared teachers quitting after a year 
or two?” The answer to this question is discussed in 
Chapter IV in connection with the correlation of prepara- 
tion and experience. 
2. Hauperience. 
The rapid “turn-over” in the teaching force contributes 
much of the difficulty in organizing an educational system 
that will produce the optimum citizenship. This “turn- 
over” is more rapid in the rural schools than in those of any 
other class. Evenden? found the median experience for 
urban teachers to be seven and one-half terms, while the 
Nebraska Survey! found the median experience for rural

beginning to teach, the novices would show up still better.

Column one shows the number of months of teaching ex- 
perience the individuals have had. Column two shows the 
number of female teachers who have taught the number of 
months shown in the corresponding row of column one. 
For example, 316 female teachers had had no experience. 
At the bottom of the table are shown the 75, 50, and 25 per-

centiles and Q for each group. Beneath the table is a bar 
graph showing the percentages of male and female teach- 
ers who had taught for the number of months shown in the 
first column. 
The range of experience is from no months to 180, all 
above 46 being thrown together into one interval. A rapid 
dwindling in numbers is evident after the 11-15 month in- 
terval among the females, while those for the males vary 
but little until the 21-25 month interval is passed. 
The median for the females falls at 8.45 months and that 
for the males at 9.5. Of course the inclusion of the novices 
lowers these medians, but they show the experience of the 
median rural school-teacher at the beginning of the school 
year 1921-1922. With the novices eliminated, the medians 
become 13 and 17.5 months for the females and males, re- 
spectively. This, however, was their median experience 
at the end of the session, 1920-1921. A comparison of 
either set of medians indicates that the men persist longer 
than the women. 
The stationary percentage of men from 26 to 46 months 
of service is probably the effect of the war in drawing away 
numbers of the younger men. 
It is interesting to note that the percentage of male nov- 
ices compared with experienced males is slightly larger 
than the percentage of novice females compared with expe- 
rienced females. It may indicate a tendency for a larger 
proportion of men to become teachers. 
With a median service of 13 and 17.5 months for the fe- 
males and males, respectively, the terms must be limited to 
five or six months. The longer term in the consolidated 
school doubtless raises the medians. 
8. Intelligence. 
A great deal has been done during the last ten years in 
studying the intelligence of school children, but very little 
has been done with the teachers in that respect. Knight! 
tested a number of trained teachers in three city systems 
in Massachusetts, and concluded that “given enough intelli- 
gence to get through high school and two years of normal 
school, it was not a subsequent factor in teaching success.” 
This statement is based on the teachers who are highly 
trained. Hence, it is not necessarily true in regard to rural 
teachers, a large proportion of whom have not even com- 
pleted high school. Turner? obtained the Otis scores of 470

Arkansas teachers, most of them rural, and found a posi- 
tive correlation between intelligence and training and in- 
telligence and pay, but no definite relation between intelli- 
gence and experience. That there is an intelligence level 
below which none should be permitted to teach has been 
suggested by Miss Gambill,! and to that end the data of 
this section are suggestive. 
The Otis Scale for General Intelligence, Advanced Exam- 
ination, consists of ten tests, each of which contains from 
twenty to thirty questions. A time limit is assigned to 
each test. The whole may be completed within an hour. 
The highest possible score is 230 and the lowest is 0. Norms 
have been established for this scale for each chronological 
age from 8 to 18, at which age the norm becomes constant. 
The normal score for an adult is 130.

EXPLANATION OF TABLE III 
The first column shows the scores made in the test. Col- 
umn two shows the number of experienced female teachers 
making the score in the corresponding row of column one. 
For example, three experienced female teachers made scores

18 Mississippi Rural Teachers 
within the interval 201-205. At the bottom of the table 
are shown the 25, 50, and 75 percentiles and Q for each 
column. 
The range of the scores is seen to be from 30 to 215, with 
the widest range shown by the female teachers. 
The experienced female teachers have the best scores on 
comparison of the medians and quartiles. The experienced 
males follow, with the novice males third, and the novice 
females last. However, the novice females are bunched 
closer to their median score than the novice males, who 
drop below the female score at the lowest quartile. On 
comparing the sexes on the same points, indications are that’ 
the females are slightly better than the males. On com- 
paring the experienced teachers with the novices, the for- 
mer seem to be considerably better.

  EXPLANATION OF FIGURE III-A 
This graph shows the comparison of the actual frequency 
diagram of the Otis scores with the normal frequency curve. 
The data on the actual frequency graph are taken from 
Table III, column eight. The scores are laid off on the 
base line and the frequency to the left. The normal curve
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 Mississippi Rural Teachers 
is superimposed by determining the ordinates in terms of 
sigma (5.704). (Table II in Rugg’s Statistical Methods 
Applied to Education, page 388.) 
In order to check the closeness of fit of the actual curve 
to the normal curve, the following formula! was used: 
; fies 3 eee eS Sigma of sampling = \ N 
Where f is the frequency at the point chosen on the nor- 
mal curve, N is the number of cases in the whole distribu- 
tion. The difference between the theoretical and actual 
frequency at any point must be less than three times the 
sigma of sampling if the distribution is normal. 
In this curve the greatest difference apparent is at the 
apex of the curve. Substituting in the formula, we have: 
Sigma — «2 ae BBAG1) 9 og 
Since the actual difference is 111 — 88.461 — 22.539, the 
distribution is normal.

EXPLANATION OF TABLE III-B 
Column one shows the chronological age; column two, 
the Otis norm corresponding to the age in the same row; 
and the remaining columns, the percentages of the respec- 
tive groups of teachers falling below the norm in the cor- 
responding row. For example, 4.5 per cent of the expe- 
rienced female teachers scored below the Otis norm for 
twelve-year-old children. 
The experienced teachers again show up as better than 
the novices. The suggestion here obtrudes itself that teach- 
ing experience may cause a higher test score through greater

familiarity, but the correlation between the two is almost 
negligible, being .09 + .026 for females and .125 + .05 for 
males. (See Chapter IV, page 31.) 
The female experienced teachers are slightly better than 
the males, though the males show smaller percentages be- 
low the 12, 18, and 14-year norms. 
There is not much to choose between the novices, except 
that the males have a higher percentage of very low scores. 
The most remarkable feature of the table is that 55.9 per 
cent of all the cases scored below the norm they should have 
attained. This condition is further accentuated when it is 
known that the compulsory education law compels the at- 
tendance of children up to their fifteenth birthday at schools 
in many of which the intelligence level of the child is above 
that of the teacher. 
4. Achievement. 
The achievement of teachers has been sought through 
examination as a means to ascertaining their proficiency in 
subject-matter. Few, if any, of these examinations have 
been in the nature of standardized tests in the subjects they 
were toteach. The following tables show the results of giv- 
ing such tests to the rural teachers:

Column one shows the score made in the Woody-McCall 
Mixed Fundamentals Arithmetic Test, Form 2. Column 
two shows the number of experienced female teachers who 
made the score in the corresponding row of the first column. 
For example, 22 experienced female teachers scored 34 in 
the test. 
The range is greatest among the novice females, being 
from 12 to 34. The narrowest range is among the novice 
males, none of whom made a perfect score.

In the first column is shown the various percentiles from 
10 to 90, with the high and low scores. Column two shows 
the score made by the experienced female teachers accord- 
ing to the percentile in the corresponding row of the first 
column. In the last column is given the eighth-grade 
norm. For example, the score below which 80 per cent 
of the experienced females came is 31.5, which is .9 more 
than the norm for the eighth grade. 
The experienced females are above the norm, except for 
the 40 and 50 percentiles. The experienced males are well 
above the norm for each percentile, but not enough to indi- 
cate that the eighth-grade comparison is too low for them. 
The novices are below in every instance, with the novice 
females below the seventh-grade norm at the 40, 50, 60, and 
70 percentiles. :

These comparisons! indicate that the novice teachers are 
below the standard of achievement that their own pupils 
should attain and that the experienced teachers have barely 
attained it.

EXPLANATION OF TABLE V 
Column one shows the scores made in the rate of reading 
in the Monroe Silent Reading Test, Form 2, Test 3. Col- 
umn two shows the number of experienced female teachers 
whose score fell in the class interval in the corresponding 
row of column one. For example, four experienced female 
teachers made a score between 151 and 155. 
The range in rate of reading was from 25 to 155, with a 
distinct tendency to bunch scores in a few intervals. The 
highest scores were made by experienced females, with the 
novice females scoring the lowest. 
The percentile table follows:   
‘Dr. McCall was consulted as to the comparability of these scores, since the teach- 
ers were limited to ten minutes instead of the usual twenty minutes. It is his opin- 
ion, as well as that of the examiners, that the teachers had exhausted their ability in 
that time. The papers show low scores due to errors rather than lack of time.

EXPLANATION OF TABLE V-A 
The first column shows the percentiles; the second, the 
score below which the corresponding per cent of the expe- 
rienced females fell; and the last columns, the norms for the 
eleventh and twelfth grades. For example, 95 per cent of 
the experienced females scored below 144.8, whereas the cor- 
responding score for the twelfth grade is 147.9. 
A comparison of each group with the twelfth-grade norm 
shows that each is slightly better than the norm, though 
there are numerous fluctuations, particularly among the 
highest percentiles, where they more nearly approximate 
the eleventh-grade norm. This may indicate that the best 
readers do not choose teaching. However, the median 
schooling of these teachers is 10.93 grades; so they are not 
far off in their scores.

EXPLANATION OF TABLE VI-A 
The first column shows the percentile; the second, the 
score for experienced female teachers; the last two columns, 
the eleventh-grade and the twelfth-grade norms. For ex- 
ample, 95 per cent of the experienced female teachers scored 
below 59.5, which is .6 above the twelfth-grade norm. 
This table shows that the experienced female teachers 
and the novice male teachers average up to the twelfth- 
grade norm, with the novice females and the experienced 
males almost a grade behind them. However, the lower 
percentiles show up consistently above the norm, with the 
upper percentiles below the norm. 
5. Pay. 
The pay received for services rendered has much to do 
with the quality of service. The Nebraska Survey! shows 
for two districts a median monthly salary paid to rural 
teachers in 1914-1915 of $47.69. The shortage of teachers 
incident to the war has raised salaries generally, though 
the following table shows that they are not yet munificent.:

EXPLANATION OF TABLE VII 
Column one shows the monthly salary intervals and col- 
umn two the number of female teachers receiving a salary 
within the interval in the corresponding row of column one. 
Column three shows the same for male teachers. At the 
a5 of the table are given the 25, 50, and 75 percentiles 
and Q. 
The range of female salaries is from $35.00 per month to 
$150.00, with a very small percentage (3 1-3) above $100.00. 
There are two and one-half times as many who receive less 
than $50.00. With Q at $60.73, M at $70.00, Q3 at $79.10, 
and a semi-interquartile range of only $9.18, the financial 
“usa to the woman rural teacher are fairly definitely 
xed. 
The range of male salaries is from $35.00 per month to 
$250.00. There is only one case at the upper limit, and the 
nearest cases to this one are at $200.00. The latter is possi- 
bly more nearly the maximum for rural male teachers. 
There seems to be a tendency for male salaries to increase 
by definite large units, as the distribution shows concen- 
tration at the $75.00, $100.00, $125.00, and $150.00 inter- 
vals. Approximately the same percentage (7.5) receive 
more than $150.00 as receive less than $60.00. Q shows 
that there is a variation of $10.18 from the median for the 
middle 50 per cent of the men. 
A comparison of the medians shows that the male teacher 
receives 37.9 per cent more than the female teacher. 
Ninety-one per cent of the females do not attain the median 
male salary, while 81 per cent of the males exceed the me- 
dian female salary. 
A comparison of the 25 percentiles shows the male sal- 
ary 24.95 per cent better than the female; the 75 percentile 
shows 21.92 per cent in favor of the male. The greatest 
difference is found between those falling within the middle 
50 per cent.

The first column shows the percentile; the second, the 
salary below which the per cent of females shown in the 
corresponding row of the first column fell; the third col- 
umn, the percentage increase each percentile salary is over 
the next lowest. 
The rate of increase is erratic for both males and females, 
but is consistently larger for the males than for the females, 
except at the 60 and 90 percentiles. The percentage in- 
crease for the women tends to decrease steadily until the 
70 percentile is passed, when it begins to increase again. 
SUMMARY OF CHAPTER III 
1. Academic Training.—The median rural teacher has 
completed 10.76 grades in school. The experienced teach- 
ers lack two months of having as much preparation as the 
novices. Of all the teachers, 21 per cent have had some 
college training, 76 per cent have had some high-school 
training, 3 per cent have had no training beyond the ele- 
mentary grades. 
2. Experience-—The median rural teacher had at the 
close of the 1920-1921 session taught 13 months if female 
and 17.5 months if male. The rate of withdrawal from 
teaching is less among the men. The percentage of men 
persisting beyond 45 months is three and two-fifths times 
the percentage of women for that period. The percentage 
of men beginning to teach a second session in September, 
1921, was slightly greater than that for women. 
3. Intelligence.—The median rural teacher has an intel- 
ligence slightly below the norm for adults. The experienced 
female is practically normal, followed, respectively, by the
-P-A-G-E-30
30 Mississippi Rural Teachers 
experienced male, the novice male, and the novice female. 
Eighteen and two-tenths per cent of all the teachers are be- 
low the normal score of a fourteen-year-old child, whom the 
compulsory education law compels to go to such teachers 
for instruction. The experienced teacher has a higher in- 
telligence than the novice. 
4, Achievement.—In the fundamental operations of arith- 
metic the experienced teachers approximate the eighth- 
grade norms, but the novices are barely up to the seventh- 
grade standard. The male teachers excel the females in 
their respective groups. 
In reading rate, each group averages slightly better than 
the twelfth-grade norm, though the highest percentiles 
more nearly approximate the eleventh-grade norm. The 
experienced teachers are slightly better than the novices. 
The novice males are poorest. 
In reading comprehension, the experienced teachers aver- 
age up to the twelfth-grade norm, but the novices are al- 
most a grade behind them. The lower percentiles show con- 
sistently above the norm, with the upper ones below it. 
5. Pay.—The range of monthly salaries paid females is 
from $35.00 to $150.00, with the median at $70.00. The 
range of salaries paid male teachers is from $35.00 to 
$250.00, with the median at $96.57. Based on medians, the 
male teacher receives a 37.9 per cent higher salary than the 
female teacher. Ninety-one per cent of the female teachers 
do not attain the median salary paid the men, but 81 per 
cent of the men exceed the median salary paid the women. 
The initial salary paid women is lower than for the men, but 
in the highest percentiles the rate of increase of pay is ap- 
proximately the same.

CHAPTER IV 
Chapter III set forth the data showing as isolated items 
the academic preparation, experience, intelligence, achieve- 
ment, and pay of rural teachers in Mississippi. This chap- 
ter (IV) will study the relation that each bears to the other. 
The first section of the chapter shows the relationships by 
means of total correlations; the second section uses the 
method of partial correlation; the third, that of multiple 
correlation. 
SECTION 1—CoRRELATIONS! 
A positive correlation shows that as one variable in- 
creases, the other does also; while a negative correlation 
shows that as one variable increases, the other decreases. 
From 0 to .20 is considered a negligible correlation; from 
-35 to .50, marked; from .50 to .70, high; above .70, very 
high. The probable error indicates the amount of varia- 
tion in the coefficient of correlation, as successive samples 
are drawn from the same universe. Within + 1 probable 
error the probabilities are even (1: 1) that r shows the true 
relationship; within + 2 P. E. they are 4.5 to 1; within + 
3 P.E., 21 to 1; within + 4 P.E., 142 to 1. Hence, a sat- 
isfactory degree of reliability requires that r be at least 
four times the P. E.

EXPLANATION OF TABLE VIII 
Correlations for female teachers are shown above the 
diagonal; males, below. 
To find r for training and intelligence of females, locate 
the intersection of the row training with the intelligence 
column, where .2664 is found with its P. E. immediately 
beneath it. To find the one for the males, locate the inter- 
section of the intelligence row with the training column, 
where .376 is found. 
The Relation of Training to Experience.——The table 
(VIII) shows for women that r = .235 + .025; for men, 
.32 + .05. These are low correlations, but the probabilities 
are greater than 142 to 1 that teachers above the mean in 
training will be above the mean in term of service. The 
regressions show that each additional year given to train- 
ing is accompanied by an increase of 244 months in term 
of service for the women and 5 months for men. This in- 
dicates that a law requiring the completion of high school 
and two years of normal-school training before beginning 
to teach would tend to increase the term of service of women 
from 8.45 months to 16.75 months; for men, from 9.5 to 
23.5 months. 
The Relation of Training to Intelligence—For women r 
(.27 + .02) is low, while that for men (.38+ .04) is 
marked. The regression of intelligence on training indi- 
cates that for each additional year of training the intelli- 
gence score for women is 5 higher; for men, 614, higher. 
If two years of normal-school training above high school 
were required before teaching, the probabilities are that 
the level of intelligence of the rural teacher would be raised 
from the present mean of 126.7 to above 140. 
The regression of training on intelligence indicates that 
an increase of 60 in Otis score for women and 40 for men 
is accompanied by an increase of one year in training. 
The Relation of Training to Arithmetic—For men r 
(.21 + .05) is low, though much higher than for women 
(.09 + .025). This seems to verify the statement fre- 
quently made that males do better in arithmetic than fe- 
males. The regression of arithmetic on training shows an 
increase of one problem in arithmetic, with an increase of 
4 years in training for women and two for men; for train- 
ing on arithmetic, an increase of 33 problems for women 
and 11 for men is accompanied by an increase of 1 year in 
training. 
The Relation of Training to Reading Rate and Compre- 
hension.—F ox each sex a very low correlation, with a cor- 
respondingly large probable error, is shown. This would
-P-A-G-E-33
  
Mississippi Rural Teachers 33 
spelen that the relationship is too variable for relia- 
ility. 
The Relation of Training to Composite Achievement.— 
For the women there is a very low positive correlation 
(.086 + .026), invalidated by a correspondingly large prob- 
able error; for the men there is a low correlation (.246 + 
.06). The regression of composite achievement on training 
indicates that for men one year and for women two years 
of additional training are accompanied by an increase in 
achievement of one-tenth sigma (2%). 
The Relation of Training to Pay—For women r (.38 + 
02) is marked and for men (.51 + .04) may be called high. 
The regression of pay on training indicates that each addi- 
tional year of training is accompanied by an increase in pay 
of $4 per month for women and $10 for men, while that of 
training on pay shows that an increase of $27 per month in 
pay for women and $40 for men is accompanied by an in- 
crease of one year in training. 
The requirement of the completion of high school and 
two years of normal-school training should raise the aver- 
age pay of women from $70 per month to $82; for men, 
from $96.57 to $126.57. 
The Relation of Experience to Intelligence—For each 
sex a very low positive correlation (women, .094 + .026; 
men, .13 + .05) is rendered unreliable by a correspondingly 
large probable error. The tabulation shows a tendency for 
the high and low Otis scores to be eliminated as experience 
increases. 
The Relation of Experience to Arithmetic—tThere is a 
low positive correlation (women, .22 + .02; men, .19 + 
.05) for each sex. The regression of arithmetic on expe- 
rience indicates that an increase of 30 in score for women 
and 8 for men is accompanied by an increase of 5 months 
in experience, while an increase of 11-5 months in expe- 
rience for women and 30 months for men is attended by an 
increase of one problem in score. 
The Relation of Experience to Reading Rate and Com- 
prehension.—In each instance a very low r, tending to be- 
come negative for men, has a correspondingly large prob- 
able error, which renders the relationship unreliable. The 
indications seem to be that teaching does not improve the 
teacher’s reading ability, or else better readers quit the rural 
school. 
The Relation of Experience to Composite Achievement. 
—For women r shows a low (.228 + .025) positive rela- 
tionship; while that for men is so small as to be negligible, 
even though the probable error did not render it unreliable. 
The regression of experience on achievement for women «    
-P-A-G-E-34
34 Mississippi Rural Teachers 
indicates that an increase of six-tenths of sigma (12%) is 
accompanied by an increase of 5 months in experience, or 
25 months’ increase in experience by three-tenths of sigma 
(6%). The Relation of Experience to Pay.—For each sex r 
shows a marked relationship between these two factors 
(women, .387 + .02; men, .38 + .045). The regression of 
pay on experience indicates that an increase of 30 months 
in experience for women and 20 months for men is accom- 
panied by an increase of $10 per month in pay, while that 
of experience on pay shows for each $40 per month increase 
in pay there is for women an increase of 15 months’ expe- 
rience and 11 months for men. 
The Relation of Intelligence to Composite Achievement.— 
There is a high correlation (.51 + .02) for women and a 
marked one (.4595 + .048) for men. The regression of 
composite achievement on intelligence indicates that an in- 
crease of 10 in Otis score is accompanied by an increase of 
seven-tenths sigma (14%) for women and one-tenth sigma 
(2%) for men, or an increase of sigma in achievement is 
accompanied by an increase in Otis score of 37 for women 
and 20 for men. 
The Relation of Intelligence to Pay—There is a low 
relationship for both sexes (.24 + .025 for women and 
.8156 + .05 for men). The regression of pay on intelli- 
gence shows that an increase in Otis score of 15 for women 
and 25 for men is accompanied by an increase of $10 per 
month in pay; or an increase of $25 per month in pay for 
women and $80 for men is accompanied by an increase of 
20 in Otis score. Apparently the effect of intelligence on 
. pay is greater with the women than with the men. 
The Relation of Arithmetic Score to Pay.—There is a 
low positive relationship for both sexes, though the large 
probable error tends to invalidate that of men. The re- 
gression of pay on arithmetic shows that an increase in 
score of 6 for women and 8 for men is accompanied by an 
increase of $5 per month in pay, or an increase of $20 per 
month in pay for women and $35 for men is accompanied 
by an increase of one in arithmetic score. 
The Relation of Reading Rate and Comprehension to 
Pay.—For both sexes the correlation is very low, tending 
to negative values for men. The size of the probable error 
renders them all unreliable, except comprehension for 
women. Apparently reading ability has little or no rela- 
tionship to salary. 
The Relation of Composite Achievement to Pay.—The re- 
lation for each sex is very low, that of men being rendered
-P-A-G-E-35
Mississippi Rural Teachers 35 
unreliable by a large probable error. The regression of 
achievement on pay for women shows an increase of one- 
tenth sigma (2%) with an increase of $12.50 per month 
in pay; or an increase of $5 per month in pay with an in- 
crease of 1.25 sigma (25%). It is probable that employ- 
ing a teacher at a higher salary tends to secure one better 
in achievement, but high achievement is recognized very lit- 
tle in fixing salary. 
SECTION 2—PARTIAL CORRELATIONS! 
The first section of this chapter deals with the relation- 
ship existing between various pairs of factors as shown by 
means of total correlation. It has been brought out that 
such relationships may be affected by a factor included in 
both variables the relation of which to each variable may 
be found. For example, the relationship of training to 
achievement is affected by intelligence. We desire to know 
the relation of training to achievement with the effect of 
intelligence removed. This can be ascertained by consid- 
ering only those cases in which intelligence is the same, but 
that process is too cumbersome. It can also be determined 
by the method of partial correlation when the total correla- 
tions of the three, or more, variables are known. The gen- 
eral formula for this process is given by Yule? as: 
Tie sa...(n—1) — Vinsa... 2—) Von... —0)

In order to find the relation of pay to training, with intel- 
ligence, experience, and achievement remaining constant, 
we have: Bia 34 cy

ment. 
By substituting the values given in Table VIII and mak- 
ing the required computations, we find the following rela-

EXPLANATION OF TABLE IX 
The total correlation of pay and training (51) is .3828 + 
.026 for females and .5144 + .04 for males. When the in- 
fluence of experience on each of these factors is eliminated, 
the correlation is reduced to .326 for females and .443 for 
males. When the influence of experience and intelligence 
is eliminated, there is a further drop to .285 for females and 
.881 for males. Upon eliminating the influence of expe- 
rience, intelligence, and achievement, there is a slight in- 
crease to .286 for females and .391 for males.
-P-A-G-E-37
Mississippi Rural Teachers 37 
In the same way the influence of the other factors on pay 
and experience, pay and intelligence, pay and achievement, 
and experience and intelligence, is eliminated. 
The relation of training to pay, with the other factors 
constant, is proportionately the same for both sexes. 
The same is true with pay and experience, except that 
intelligence has a negative effect, which is larger with the 
females than the males. 
The elimination of training reduces the relation between 
pay and intelligence; but when experience and achievement 
are held constant, they show a negative influence for males 
and positive for females. 
The relation of pay to achievement is low in each sex, but 
is reduced almost to zero for the females and becomes un- 
mistakably negative for the males, after training, intelli- 
gence, and experience are eliminated. 
Experience and intelligence begin low and are rapidly 
reduced for both sexes to a negative relationship when 
training, achievement, and pay are held constant. The 
larger negative effect of achievement on males and the 
larger positive total relationship between experience and 
intelligence for males reduce the decisiveness of the nega- 
tive value of the partial coefficient for them. 
Achievement and intelligence begin with a marked cor- 
relation for both sexes. The elimination of the influence 
of training has very little effect with the female coefficient, 
but decreases the male. The further elimination of expe- 
rience increases each coefficient slightly. 
Using the formulas suggested by Yule,’ the following re- 
gressions are found: 
X, = .58X,+.25X, + .07X, + .01X, for females, and 
X, = 1.57X, + .83X, + .23X, — .12X, for males. 
X, represents pay; X,, training; X., experience; X,, in- 
telligence; and X,, achievement. For women, as X, in- 
creases one year, X, increases $2.50 per month (for class 
intervals of one year in training and $5 per month in pay 
and within the limits of this study). In the same way 
all of the other factors increase pay in proportion to their 
coefficients, except achievement in males, where a decrease 
occurs.

SECTION 3—MULTIPLE CORRELATION! 
Having found the relation of academic preparation, 
experience, intelligence, and achievement to pay for each 
sex, the question naturally arises: “Do these items consti- 
tute an appreciable number of the factors that enter into 
the amount of salary paid?” In order to answer this ques- 
tion, we must resort to the method of multiple correlation. 
The fundamental difference between partial and multiple 
correlation is that in partial correlation, with, for instance, 
five variables, the fundamental relation sought is between 
two variables, with the three others out or controlled; while 
in multiple correlation, with the same five factors involved, 
the fundamental relation sought would be between one vari- 
able and the remaining four used collectively. The sym- 
bols indicate this difference, as 12.345 means the correla- 
tion between 1 and 2 when 8, 4, and 5 are out; while the 
symbol 71.2345 (multiple) means the significance of the 
first variable (1) when 2, 3, 4, and 5 are used collectively 
with 1. The formula for finding multiple correlation with 
five variables is: 
2 6 0 0 ee 
This result can be checked by the use of the formula: 
"1.2345 = (1 (1—r?,.) (1 —r’g2) (L—Pises) (1 Pso)) 
The value of *1.2345 should, of course, be the same, using 
the two formulas. 
. In the partial correlation, if 12.345 approaches zero, then 
the total correlation of "12 shows increased dependence on 
the factors 3, 4, and 5, and loses significance as an indica- 
tion. Conversely, if *12.345 approaches 1, then "12 shows 
increased independence of variables 3, 4, and 5, and increas- 
ing importance as an indication. 
In the multiple correlation, if 71.2345 approaches zero, 
then there are some important factors unconsidered, and the 
ones used are not the most important causal factors. On 
the other hand, if *1.2345 approaches 1, as .85, .90, or .95, 
then most of the important factors are being considered, 
and the results as indicated by partials are significant. If 
all factors are considered, multiple correlation is 1. 
On substituting in the above formula, the coefficient of 
multiple correlation for the females is found to be .498; for   
1Rosenow: An Analysis of Mental Abilities, Psychological Monographs, Vol. 24,

the males, .584. These coefficients indicate that the factors 
involved in this study are significant, but others as highly 
significant are not touched. 
SUMMARY OF CHAPTER IV 
1. Total Correlations. 
Those teachers who have had the most schooling tend to 
longer terms of service. With equal schooling, men tend to 
teach longer than women. 
There is a low correlation between amount of schooling 
and intelligence. Approximately one-third of those scor- 
ing below the norm for fourteen-year-old pupils are above 
the median in schooling, there being a larger proportion of 
men than women. 
There is a negligible correlation for women and a low 
correlation for men between schooling and ability in the 
fundamental operations in arithmetic. 
The reading rate and comprehension correlations. with 
schooling are negligible for both sexes. 
There is a marked correlation between schooling and pay 
for both sexes, higher for men. The regressions show that 
aman’s pay increases with schooling two and one-half times 
as fast as that of women. 
There is a negligible correlation between intelligence and 
experience for both sexes. One-fourth of the women and 
one-third of the men below the Otis fourteen-year norm are 
above the median in experience. The high and low Otis 
scores seem to quit teaching first. 
There is a low correlation between experience and arith- 
metic ability for both sexes. 
The correlations between experience and reading rate and 
experience and reading comprehension are negligible for 
both sexes, though tending to be negative for the males. 
Either teaching prevents further development in reading 
ability or the best readers do not teach. 
There is a marked correlation between experience and 
pay for both sexes, but the increase is more rapid for the 
men. 
Intelligence seems to have some effect on pay, though one- 
fifth of the women and one-fourth of the men below the 
fourteen-year norm are above the median in pay. 
Achievement seems to have no effect on pay for either sex. 
Training improves composite achievement for men, but 
experience has no effect. The opposite seems true for 
women. 
There is a marked correlation between composite achieve-
-P-A-G-E-40
40 Mississippi Rural Teachers 
ment and intelligence for both sexes, though 18.6 per cent 
of the women and 29.4 per cent of the men below the four- 
teen-year norm are above median in achievement. 
2. Partial Correlations. 
Pay and training have a low correlation for females and 
a marked one for males when experience, intelligence, and 
achievement are constant. The regressions show that pay 
increases almost three times as fast due to training for 
males as for females. 
Pay and experience, with the other factors constant, have 
the same correlation coefficient for the two sexes (.27), and 
the regressions indicate a ratio of 8 to 4 in the rate of in- 
crease of pay due to experience in favor of the men. 
Pay and intelligence, with the other factors constant, 
have a positive but negligible coefficient of correlation for 
both sexes. The regressions indicate that intelligence 
counts three times as much for the men as for the women. 
Pay and achievement, with the other factors constant, 
have no relation for either sex, though the correlation co- 
efficient for the males is fairly strong in the negative direc- 
tion. 
Experience and intelligence begin with a negligible coeffi- 
cient of correlation for each sex, which decreases to a neg- 
ative relationship when training, achievement, and pay are 
held constant. The negative relationship is stronger for 
females than for males. 
Composite achievement and intelligence begin with a 
marked correlation for each sex, the females some higher 
than the males. With the elimination of the influence of 
training and experience, the coefficient is increased slightly 
for the women and decreased for the men. 
8. Multiple Correlations. 
The factors involved in this study have a marked relation 
to pay, but others as highly significant are not touched.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
1. Summary. 
Chapter I states the purpose of the study as (1) to deter- 
mine whether practice takes into account in fixing the sal- 
ary of the rural teacher in Mississippi his academic prepa- 
ration, experience, intelligence, achievement, and sex; (2) 
to arrive at a tentative minimum intelligence norm for 
rural teachers; (3) to determine the relative intelligence 
of those teachers who persist in the rural schools; (4) to 
ascertain whether the quality of the rural teacher as shown 
by intelligence and achievement is improving; and (5) to 
make a comparison of the male and female rural teacher. 
Chapter II describes how the data were collected from 
the teachers assembled in the fifteen summer normals of 
Mississippi by questionnaire and testing. 
Chapter III shows the data of the questionnaires and 
tests in tabular and graphic form. So far as possible, the 
data of each test are compared to standard norms. 
Chapter IV indicates the relationship existing between 
every factor and each subsequent one. In order to remove 
the interdependence of the factors, partial correlation is 
used. .To show that the factors included in the study are 
significant, multiple correlation is resorted to. 
2. Conclusions. 
In accordance with the analysis of the data as made in 
Chapters III and IV, it is believed that the following con- 
clusions are justified : 
1. Though the combined effect of training, experience, 
intelligence, achievement, and sex on pay is significant, as 
shown by the multiple correlation, there are other factors 
whose combined effect is probably of equal weight. 
2. The pay of rural teachers increases with training, that 
of the men more rapidly. 
8. The pay of rural teachers increases with experience, 
that of the men more rapidly. 
4. Intelligence has little effect on the pay of men and less 
on the pay of women. 
5. Achievement in arithmetic and reading has a negligi- 
ble effect on the pay of women and tends to have a negative 
effect on the pay of men. 
6. The median rural teacher is below normal in intelli- 
gence.

7. No novice should be permitted to teach who consis- 
tently makes an Otis score (or the equivalent on another 
scale) below 101 
8. As experience increases, intelligence tends to decrease. 
Apparently the most intelligent and the least intelligent 
teachers drop out earliest, leaving those of middle intelli- 
gence to persist. This tendency seems to be stronger 
among the women. 
9. The quality of the rural teacher, as shown by intelli- 
gence and achievement, is not improving. 
10. Teaching does not improve the teacher’s reading abil- 
y. 
11. If the classes in the schools from which rural teach- 
ers are drawn are normal in achievement, the best pupils do 
not teach. 
12. The male rural teacher surpasses the female in train- 
ing, experience, the fundamental operations of arithmetic, 
reading rate, and pay. The female surpasses the male in 
intelligence and reading comprehension.

  OTHER STUDIES SUGGESTED 
1. To find all the factors upon which the pay of a rural 
teacher depends. 
2. At what point in school training is the maximum of 
achievement in reading reached? 
3. Does the best reader or computer make the best teacher 
of such subjects? 
4. Does teaching rural pupils tend to decrease the teach- 
er’s Pose comprehension through restriction of vocabu- 
lary? 
5. Why is society willing to pay a male teacher more than 
a female?

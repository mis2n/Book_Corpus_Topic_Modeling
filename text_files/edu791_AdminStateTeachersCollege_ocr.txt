CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
The duties of an administrator in charge of an educa- 
tional institution have become so numerous and technical 
that he has been forced to resort to his faculty for relief. 
Formerly the president of a small college or normal school 
not only administered his school, but did part-time teaching 
as well. About the only assistance he had in the adminis- 
tration of his school was an office clerk or secretary. Later, 
as the demands upon his time grew, he appointed such sub- 
ordinate officials to assist him in his work as a vice-presi- 
dent, or assistant principal, a treasurer, or a registrar, the 
duties of any one of whom were legion. Then, as the presi- 
dent’s duties and responsibilities continued to grow and the 
spirit of democracy in school administration began to de- 
velop, he turned to his faculty for assistance, and to-day it 
is the general practice of the schools of higher learning to 
employ standing committees of the faculty to assist in the 
organization and administration of the institution. Normal 
schools and state teachers colleges having developed during 
this period of emphasis upon democracy in school adminis- 
tration, their presidents have, as a matter of common prac- 
tice, accepted the principle of the employment of commit- 
tees of the faculty to assist them in the organization and 
administration of their schools. But these presidents ac- 
cepted the practice in the spirit of blind obedience to cus- 
tom, and to-day there is a total lack of any standardization 
in either number or names of faculty committees employed 
or the nature of the functions assigned them. 
1. SOME REASONS FOR THE STUDY 
In making a catalog study of the faculty committees of 
state teachers colleges as listed in their annual bulletins, 
the writer was impressed with the lack of standardization 
either in the number of standing committees employed by 
the presidents to assist in the administration of their schools 
or the titles assigned these committees. In an earlier at- 
tempt to ascertain what the functions of certain committees 
were, this lack of standardization was even more evident. 
As a somewhat typical case showing the lack of agreement 
among the different schools in the assignment of duties to
-P-A-G-E-9
8 Administration of State Teachers Colleges 
committees bearing the same name, the Student Welfare 
Committee in two different schools will serve to illustrate. 
In one school! the duties of this committee were: 
1. Schedule all social events. 
2. Assist students in securing rooms and board. 
P see that landladies comply with the regulations of the 
school. 
4. See that teams are well cared for at tournaments. 
In another school? the same committee, in name, had been 
assigned duties as follows: 
1. Administer student loan fund. 
2. Look after the students’ health and general welfare. 
8. Handle serious cases of discipline. 
4. Assist students in securing work to help defray ex- 
penses while attending school. 
Then, before collecting the data in full relative to the 
functions of faculty committees, the replies from presidents 
to letters requesting a detailed statement of the functions 
of their committees were still more convincing that a study 
of this nature was much needed. In more than half the re- 
plies the following letter is typical: 
Dear SIR: 
We are sending you a catalog under separate cover. On page — 
is given a list of our faculty committees. I think the title of the com- 
mittee in each case will indicate what its work is.° 
While the replies of a few presidents were of the nature 
of this one: 
My Dear Sir: 
. Ihave been trying to give you some information that will 
be helpful to you, but I am afraid I cannot do it. I have not worked 
out the question of faculty committees and what each committee is to 
do. In fact, I am working on that very problem this term, and you 
will be of much service to me if you will send me a copy of your find- 
ings. Yours sincerely, 
President.’ 
And, finally, the need of such a study was urged by sev- 
eral faculty members of state normal schools and teachers 
colleges who were then graduate students in George Pea-   
Maryville, Mo.

body College for Teachers. It was their contention that 
faculty committees in normal schools and state teachers 
colleges as now organized do not properly function, that in 
some schools the duties are poorly distributed among the 
various committees, and that some committees devote too 
much time and others too little to the duties assigned them. 
From all these facts it became quite evident that a study on 
the nature and functions of committees employed by presi- 
dents of state teachers colleges to assist in the administra- 
tion of the schools was much needed. 
2. TH PROBLEM 
The problems which this study seeks to solve are found in 
the following questions: 
1. What standing committees are needed by the president 
of a state teachers college to assist in the administration of 
the school? 
2. What should be the functions of these committees? 
In order to arrive at intelligent answers to the above 
questions, an attempt is made to analyze the practices in 
state teachers colleges in various sections of the United 
States. In this analysis an attempt is made to discover 
answers to the following questions: How many standing 
committees does a state teachers college have in its faculty, 
and what are they? How many members are there on each 
committee? What departments of the college are repre- 
sented on these committees? How often do these commit- 
tees hold meetings? What functions do these committees 
perform? To what extent do the activities of a committee 
represent a group judgment based upon sufficient data? 
What kind of data does the president or faculty require of a 
committee as a basis for action on matters determining 
school policies? As a second step toward the anwers to the 
initial questions, the study seeks to discover the extent to 
which the functions of committees are overlapping,. and, 
hence, lacking in definiteness and administrative efficiency. 
And, finally, in order that the members of the faculty may 
participate in the administration of the school, and at the 
same time not be burdened with extra-instructional activi- 
ties, and that the president and school may have the benefit 
of expert and-group opinion on many important problems 
of the school, this study seeks to discover those committees 
a president may need and the duties he may assign them 
for the efficient administration of his school.

Upon arriving at a school, interviews were held with the 
president or dean (where there was a dean®) and commit- 
teemen. In a number of instances the writer attended 
both faculty and committee meetings. Only in a small num- 
ber of schools were there printed rules and regulations gov- 
erning the officers, faculty, and committees in the adminis- 
tration of the school. In most instances committees were 
governed by. precedent, trusted to memory, or waited for 
new assignment of duties with specific instructions, or, as 
was too often the case, did nothing. Faculty minutes and 
committee minutes (where available) for at least two years 
back were read and information concerning the activities of 
committees recorded. Faculty rules and regulations, blank 
forms of many kinds used by committees in the performance 
of their duties, committee reports, bulletins, and other 
printed matter prepared by committees were collected to be 
used in the study as documentary evidence. / 
(b) CRITERIA AS BASES FOR SELECTING DUTIES AND TYPE OF 
ORGANIZATION 
(1) Standards of Accrediting Agencies.—In attempting 
to answer the questions raised in this study, no attempt is 
made to say what administrative duties a president may or 
may not have to perform, for a solution of that problem 
-would require a special investigation in itself. But since a 
large per cent of the state teachers colleges included in this 
study are located in the field of the North Central Associ- 
ation of Colleges and Secondary Schools, and many of them 
are members of that association, the standards set up for 
accrediting institutions primarily for the training of teach- 
ers require or imply that the institution must perform cer- 
tain duties in order to become or remain a member of the 
association. Those requirements shall be taken into con- 
sideration in seeking to determine what committees may be 
needed by a president in the administration of his school. 
For example, one of those standards reads: “Such school 
shall require for admission not less than fifteen secondary 
units as defined by this association.”7 Another standard 
requires that a student must have completed “not less than 
120 semester hours or equivalent credit for any degree.”’s   
®More than half the schools of the study have deans of the faculty. 
°Greeley, Cedar Falls, Denton, Springfield, Warrensburg, and Kirksville had printed, 
typewritten, or mimeographed rules and regulations setting forth the duties of the 
committees, some more fully than others. 
"Proceedings of Twenty-ninth Annual Meeting of the North Central Associati Colleges and Secondary Schools, 1924, p. 12. Hon of ‘Ibid,
-P-A-G-E-13
12 Administration of State Teachers Colleges 
These imply that the institution shall pass upon the credits 
offered for entrance by a student and keep a detailed record 
of his work while in attendance. Ifa school were to do only 
those things which are required and implied in the stand- 
ards referred to, it would at least have to perform thé fol- 
lowing duties: Classify and register students; evaluate, ap- 
prove, and distribute credits presented from other institu- 
tions; provide courses of study; make schedules of classes ; 
provide and operate a library; provide and administer a 
training school; keep accurate and detailed records; grant 
certificates, diplomas, and degrees; and keep the school 
premises in an attractive and sanitary condition. Then 
there are certain very desirable functions which, if properly 
administered, assist materially in guaranteeing what is re- 
ferred to in the same standards as “the tone of the institu- 
tion.” Among them are the social activities of the students, 
athletics, entertainment and lyceum courses, exercises at 
regular assembly, extra-curricular activities, and alumni 
organizations. In addition to these, there may be added 
such desirable functions as the preparing and publishing of 
bulletins and papers of the college, administering publicity 
campaigns, organizing and administering extension and cor- 
respondence courses, and operating an appointment bureau 
for the benefit of its students. When the more than one hun- 
dred different committees are ranked in their order of fre- 
quency of occurrence in the forty-three state teachers col- 
leges of this study, all the above activities may be found in 
some form in the upper twenty-five per cent of the distribu- 
tion. 
With the manifold duties to perform and a limited amount 
of office help, the president is forced to appeal, though often 
reluctantly, to his faculty for assistance in the administra- 
tion of the school, believing that faculty members as a body 
do not wish to do this kind of work. Some administrators 
have argued for a dean of the faculty on this basis, believ- 
ing that such an official, with little or no classroom duties, 
could very materially lessen the committee work of the fac- 
ulty, and, therefore, be more satisfactory to those in charge 
of classroom instruction. As one believing that this is not 
the true condition of affairs in this very important matter, 
the writer sought first-hand information as to whether or 
not faculty members were opposed to doing this extra 
amount of extra-classroom work by asking them to give a 
voluntary expression on whether they preferred a dean of 
the faculty whose duties would be such as to relieve faculty 
members of much of their extra-classroom work or a system
-P-A-G-E-14

in which there was no dean. In response to this question, 
651 men and women in the faculties of twenty-six state 
teachers colleges, fourteen of which had a dean of the fac- 
ulty and twelve did not have, volunteered an expression of 
their choice in the matter, with the results as indicated in 
the following table:

As the vote stands two to one in favor of the “no dean” 
system, there seems to be little or no need of comment on 
the result of this poll. However, a brief analysis of the 
table may serve to show more clearly the significance of the 
vote. Of the total number voting, 208 voted in favor of 
the dean and 443 against the dean. Of the 651 votes cast 
in the twenty-six: schools, 303 were women and 348 men. 
Expressed in per cents, 32% of the total number voted for 
the dean system and 68% against the dean system. There 
seems to have been no difference between the men and women 
as to the preference in the two systems, for 33% of the men 
  
*Has a dean of the faculty.
-P-A-G-E-15
14 Administration of State Teachers Colleges 
voted for the dean system and 66% for the no dean or com- 
mittee system, while 31% of the women voted for the dean 
system and 69% for the committee system. Of the four- 
teen schools having a dean of the faculty, the majority vote 
was cast in favor of the no dean system in ten schools, and 
the vote was a tie in two others. In the schools having a 
dean the total vote for the dean system was 118, and for the 
no dean system 229. Of the twelve schools having no dean 
of the faculty, only two cast a majority vote in favor of the 
dean system. The total vote for the dean system in these 
twelve schools was 90, and the total vote for the committee, 
or no dean, system was 214. The result of this vote may be 
interpreted to mean that it was a matter of choosing be- 
tween being responsible to one head or two heads; or it may 
mean that the presence of a dean of the faculty in the school 
does not materially lessen the work of the faculty members 
in what may be termed extra-classroom activities. How- 
ever, based upon expressions of many faculty members in 
personal conferences, the most probable meaning is that fac- 
ulty members not only do not object to assisting in the ad- 
ministration of the school, but actually prefer to do some of 
this type of work. 
(2) The 75 Percentile Method.—A second criterion to be 
considered in judging the worth of a duty to be assigned to 
a committee has to do with the frequency a particular activ- 
ity occurs among the various activities performed by faculty 
committees. If the only claim for a particular activity is 
that it has been assigned to a committee or different com- 
mittees in a small per cent of the schools, it is not adjudged 
of sufficient worth to be given a place with those having 
many and more important claims ; but if an activity has been 
considered by at least 75% of the schools to be of sufficient 
worth to claim the attention of a committee as one of its 
principal functions, then that particular activity shall be 
adjudged of sufficient breadth and general interest to war- 
rant a place among the standard functions assigned faculty 
committees. This method of determining the rank and 
value of various items composing a list or series has been 
employed by careful students of administration for some 
time. Probably one of the first to make use of this method 
on an important problem was Dr. Theisen in his study in 
1915 of the “City Superintendent and the Board of Educa- 
tion,” when he determined the relative importance of each 
duty of a city board by means of the 75 percentile method. 
Applied to this study, it means that for a function to be considered standard or meriting a place on the committee,
-P-A-G-E-16
Administration of State Teachers Colleges 15 
75% or more of the schools having that committee must 
also have that particular function as one of the functions 
of the committee. 
(83) Principles of Administration—And, finally, as a 
means of judging the type of organization, powers, and 
functions of committees, use will be made of certain funda-. 
mental principles of administration. There are principles 
which all careful students of administration regard as cardi- 
nal principles of good administration, whether they be ap- 
plied in business or in education. Those general principles, 
adapted to this study, are: (1) That the president be given 
a wide range of authority over his school, (2) that he be 
held responsible for results in his school, and (3) that the 
initiative in new policies shall come from the president and 
his assistants. These principles will be assumed to guide 
both the board and the president in the administration of 
the school—assumed not because it is believed they will be 
found in practice in a majority of cases, but because they 
are fundamental to good administration—and applied in 
studying the organization, the powers, and the functions of 
the committees. 
(4) Legal Status.—It is not within the scope of this study 
to enter into an analysis of the legal limitations affecting 
either the establishment and organization of institutions 
primarily for the training of teachers or the powers and 
duties of the board of control in its relation to the adminis- 
tration of the school. It is sufficient to know that the laws 
affecting institutions of this.kind are generally broad and 
inclusive, permit a wide range of authority on the part of 
the board, and are of such a nature as to permit boards to 
adopt broad principles of sound administration.®

CHAPTER II 
COMMITTEES AND THEIR ORGANIZATION 
In Chapter I attention was called to the fact that there 
is a total lack of agreement among the schools of this study 
in the number and titles of committees employed by presi- 
dents in the administration of their schools. The discrep- 
ancy in the size of the committees is just as apparent. It is 
difficult to reconcile the facts that one school requires from 
thirty to forty standing committees, while a similar school, 
so far as the size is concerned, succeeds apparently as well 
with fewer than a half dozen committees. The question 
naturally arises: If there are certain administrative matters 
which must be looked after, who look after them? It is 
the purpose of this chapter, as a preliminary to a detailed 
study of the functions of the committees in Chapter III, to 
consider the mechanical make-up of these committees. It 
is a further aim of this chapter to consider (1) the extent 
to which presidents distribute the load of administrative 
activities among the various departments in their institu- 
tions, and (2) the amount of work done by the chairmen of 
the committees as compared with that done by the other 
members. 
Several studies in the field of school administration have 
been made covering the organization and functions of com- 
mittees employed by legislative bodies in the performance 
of their duties;! but, so far as the writer knows, no similar 
study has been made of the committees employed by an 
executive to assist him in the performance of his duties. 
Since the functions of the two types of committees are fun- 
damentally different, a review of the studies made on the 
former type of committees would be of no special signifi- 
eance in the study of the latter. In the case of one, the 
functions are advisory; in the other, administrative. 
1. THE SCHOOLS STUDIED 
Before entering into a detailed study of the committees, 
considering the number and kinds, their relation to the size

of the faculty, and the distribution of the load of adminis- 
trative duties among the departments of the school, a brief 
explanation of who are considered faculty members and in 
what departments they are counted will serve to clear up 
later discussions. In determining the number of members 
in a faculty, the practice of a majority of schools was fol- 
lowed by including the president, dean, registrar, librarian, 
and the teachers in the training school, where they were 
employed by the college and not by the public school board 
of the community; and in those schools where the bursar, 
bookkeeper, faculty secretary, or office secretary did any 
teaching or assisted materially in instructional activities, 
they have been counted as members of the faculty in this 
study. With the exception of the president, the above- 
named officials and assistants were counted in the depart- 
ments in which they did most of their teaching, or, in case 
of the latter, where they did any assisting. A detailed 
statement of the groups composing the various departments 
is given below under “Distribution of Load Among Depart- 
ments.” 
In making a comprehensive study of the number, size, 
and organization of the committees, it is essential to know 
the size of the faculties of the schools in which these com- 
mittees work. It is important to know the relation of the 
number and size of committees to the size of the faculties. 
This information about the size of the faculties and the 
number and size of the committees in the various schools is 
given in Table II. By referring to the table it will be seen 
that the number of committees per school ranges from two 
in Bowling Green, Ky., to thirty-nine in Normal. It is 
rather significant that the median number of committees per 
school, the mean, and the mode are each sixteen, while the 
middle fifty per cent range is from ten to twenty. By re- 
ferring to the last column in Table II it will be noticed that 
the range in the median size of committees is from 1 in 
gonway to 6.5 in Durant, with a median of 4.5 and modes of 
and 5.

2. RELATION OF NUMBER AND SIZE OF COMMITTEES PER 
SCHOOL TO THE SIZE OF THE FACULTY 
Since there is such a wide range in the number of com- 
mittees per school, the natural inference is that this is due 
to the very great difference in the size of the faculties. The 
actual relationship between these two series, as found by 
the Pearson product-moment formula, is .87, with a P.E. of 
-09. This would indicate that there is not a very significant 
positive relation between the size of the faculties and the 
number of committees per school. 
But if it were quantity of work to be done in a school that 
influences a president to appoint a larger or smaller num- 
ber of committees, we should expect to find a much higher 
correlation between the size of a school as indicated by the 
number of members in the faculty and the number of com- 
mittees; for surely an institution with 162 members in the 
faculty and an enrollment of 2,500 students, or one with 
133 members in the faculty and 2,300 students, would have 
more work to do than one with 24 members in the faculty 
and 300 students, or one with 39 members in the faculty 
and 600 students. These are the conditions in Cedar Falls 
and Ypsilanti, on the one hand, and East Radford and Con- 
way, on the other. But Cedar Falls has sixteen committees 
and Ypsilanti nineteen, while East Radford has nineteen 
and Conway eighteen. It is contended by some that the 
reason for the small number of committees in the larger 
institutions is due to the president’s having more executive 
assistants to perform the extra-classroom activities instead 
of burdening the faculty with these extra duties, and espe- 
cially of a dean of the faculty who is usually thought of as 
an assistant president. But that is not the case. The four 
largest institutions in this study, as measured by the num- 
ber of faculty members, are Cedar Falls, Ypsilanti, Kalama- 
zoo, and Emporia. None of these institutions has a dean 
of the faculty, and only one has more than nineteen com- 
mittes; while, on the other hand, Hays, Conway, Fred- 
ericksburg, Muncie, and Macomb are in the lower half of 
the schools, with four of them below the 80 percentile, as 
measured by the number of faculty members, and each of 
these has a dean of the faculty, and no one has fewer than 
seventeen committees. When the schools having deans are 
compared with those without deans, the average number of 
committees in the first is 16.9, as against 14.8 in the second 
group. From this it seems evident that the presence in the 
faculty of an executive dean is not sufficient in itself to war- 
rant the conclusion that a larger number of committees is
-P-A-G-E-21
20 Administration of State Teachers Colleges 
needed where there is no dean. Then the question naturally 
arises: What are the functions of the dean? But a thor- 
ough solution of the dean problem would require a special 
investigation in itself, and is without the limits of this study. 
In view of the fact that so much difference was found in 
the number of committees in different schools, the adminis- 
trative officers were often asked for an explanation; and the 
reason most commonly given was that there is so much work 
to be done, and an attempt had been made to distribute it 
among the faculty as far as possible. In one school, which 
had considerably more than the median number of commit- 
tees, the president concluded by saying: “Other committees 
probably ought to be created, but these are all we have at 
present.”2 In another school, where there was a large num- 
ber of committees, the president remarked: “I can predict 
that if you have anything to say about this institution it 
will be to express the opinion that we have loaded ourselves 
with a number of unnecessary committees, and yet we think 
in the life of the school every one has a real function to per- 
form.”? When the dean in one school was asked why he had 
so many committees, in reply to his complaint that certain 
committees did not function very well, he gave as his rea- 
son for having a particular committee: “That committee 
gives me an oportunity to pass the buck.”! 
If there is not a very high correlation between the size of 
the faculty and the number of committees per school, what, 
then, is the relationship between the size of the faculty and 
the median size of the committees? Does a president in a 
large school place more members on a committee and one 
in a small school fewer members? The relationship be- 
tween these two factors, as found by the Pearson product- 
moment formula, is .12. This result is so small that the 
relationship is insignificant. From this result it would ap- 
pear that presidents do not attempt to make large commit- 
tees in order to place faculty members on some committee. 
One other condition in which a president might be influ- 
enced in the mechanical make-up of his committees is the 
placing of more members on a committee when he has a 
small number of committees than he would if he had a larger 
number of committees.. But the relationship between the 
number of committees per faculty and the median size of 
committees shows a correlation of —.32, with a P.E. of .12.

-P-A-G-E-22
Administration of State Teachers Colleges 21 
This would seem to indicate that there is not a tendency on 
the part of presidents to make larger committees when they 
have only a few committees in their faculties. 
3. KINDS OF COMMITTEES 
There are 111 different kinds of committees in the schools 
of this study. The large number is due in part to local 
conditions, but the greatest cause for such a variety is due 
to the lack of standardization of groups of activities-com- 
- mon to practically all schools. Combinations of activities 
of many kinds are assigned to committees bearing the same 
title or similar titles. No one committee either by title or 
functions was found in all the schools. Table III shows 
these committees and the number of schools in which they 
are found for all those occurring in as many as five or more 
schools. Those occurring in fewer than five schools are 
omitted from the table. There are seventy-four commit~ 
tees which do not appear in Table III, seven of which are 
found in four schools each, eight in three schools each, 
eighteen in two schools each, and forty-one in only one school 
each. TABLE III

Table III reads: 31 schools have an appointment commit- 
tee, 31 an athletics committee, 28 an entrance and credits 
committee, etc. Among the committees not appearing in 
Table III are some whose duties are so closely related to oth- 
ers in the table that had it not been for the fact that the 
same school had the two or more kinds of committees per- 
forming entirely different as well as similar functions, they 
might well be merged and the number of committees re- 
duced. For example, the Motion Pictures Committee could 
well merge with the Entertainment and Lyceum Committee ; 
the Scholarships Committee, with the Student Loan Fund 
Committee; the Home-Coming Committee, with the Alumni 
Committee; the Credit Relations Committee, with the En- 
trance and Credits Committee; etc. 
4, DISTRIBUTION OF LOAD AMONG DEPARTMENTS 
In determining the number of departments in a school and 
the number of members in each department, the following 
groups were recognized, including in each group, besides the 
instructors in the subjects which the group naturally sug- 
gests, those teaching the branches indicated in the paren- 
theses after the group, respectively: Education (supervis- 
ors, critics, director of teacher training, and psychology) ; 
English (public speaking, expression, reading, grammar, 
and journalism) ; Science (geology and nature study) ; So- 
cial Science (history, economics, sociology, and govern- 
ment) ; Mathematics; Foreign Language; Physical Educa- 
tion (health, hygiene, nursing, and athletics) ; Music; In- 
dustrial Arts (bookbinding, printing, and vocational guid- 
ance); Agriculture (farm mechanics, gardening); Art; 
Home Economics; Extension and Correspondence; Geogra- 
phy (physical and commercial) ; Commerce (and such sub- 
jects as are usually taught in a business college) ; Library; 
and Registrar. The officers of administration and assist- 
ants, occasionally doing some teaching and frequently serv- 
ing on committees, were grouped as follows: President; 
Dean; Dean of Women; Matrons; Business Manager (bur- 
sar and financial agent) ; Secretary (bookkeeper) ; Adviser 
of Men or Women. With only three exceptions—in Gree- 
ley, Albany, and Bowling Green, Ky.—the dean of the fac- 
ulty taught in some department of the college. In deter- 
mining the number of faculty members in the departments, 
the deans were counted as other instructors and not as deans, 
with the exceptions named above.

*Figures in first column refer to schools as numbered in Table II. 
Table IV reads: In school 1, 9 members of the faculty 
are in the department of Education, 6 in the department o 
English, 3 in the department of Music, etc., with 44 as the 
total number of members in the faculty. At the bottom of 
the table is given the total number of faculty members in 
each department of all the schools combined. In Table V 
is given ‘the distribution of the committeemen in the same 
manner. At the bottom of Table V is given the total num- 
ber of committeemen in each department of all the schools

combined. The relationship existing between the total fac- 
ulty members by departments and the total committeemen 
by departments of all the schools combined was found to be, 
by the Pearson product-moment formula, .47, with a P.E. 
of .13. From these results it would seem that presidents 
have not succeeded very well in making an equitable distri- 
bution among their faculties of the load of extra-classroom 
activities. 
If the reason for distributing the executive duties among 
the faculty is to give them opportunity to get acquainted 
with the administrative procedure and enlist their interest 
and sympathy in a coéperative undertaking, and that reason 
is a sound one, many presidents fall rather short. By re- 
ferring to Tables IV and V it will be observed that in some 
schools certain departments are drawn on more than others 
for committee service, in other schools some departments 
are relieved entirely, while others are drawn on rather heav- 
ily. Using the faculty as a base in each instance and ex- 
pressing in per cents the number in each department and 
the number of times faculty members in a department ap- 
pear on a committee, Table VI shows instances where the 
executives in the schools of this study have not drawn 
proportionately upon departments for committee service. 
Since the departments of Education, English, Music, Sci- 
ence, Physical Education, Social Science, and Mathematics 
include a majority of faculty members, only those depart- 
ments are given for illustration.

Table VI reads: In school 18, 17.6% of the faculty are in 
the department of Education, 12.0% in the department of 
English, 14.8% in the department of Music, 7.4% in the 
department of Science, 4.6% each in the departments of 
Physical Education, Social Science, and Mathematics. Of 
the faculty members serving on committees in school 18, 
82.4% are from the department of Education, 15.7% from 
the department of English, 7.4% from the department of 
Music, etc. Approximately three times as much committee 
service is required of the department of Education in schools 
18 and 21 as in schools 32 and 34. In the four schools of the 
table, both the English and the Science departments are 
drawn on rather heavily for committee service, while the 
department of Music is excused in school 32 and almost re- 
lieved of committee work in school 34. Ordinarily the prep- 
aration and teaching of the social sciences exact as much of 
an instructor’s time as that of any other department, but 
in schools 18 and 34 that department carries more than its 
share of the committee work. 
When it is recognized that only a small per cent of the 
presidents make any appreciable allowance for the kind and 
quantity of the teaching load, it appears that some depart- 
ments are doing more than their share of the extra-class- 
room duties. Some instructors complained that, on account 
of their heavy load both within and without the classroom, 
their students suffered because of the lack of proper prep- 
aration of the subject-matter and the diversion of their en- 
ergies in other fields. 
If the purpose of the distribution of the administrative 
duties is to acquaint members of the faculty with the sys- 
tem, enlist their codperation and sympathy, and profit by the 
experiences and suggestions of the entire faculty through 
specialized service, some presidents are losing their oppor- 
tunities and failing to render the state their maximum serv- 
ice. 
5. WORK OF THE CHAIRMEN OF COMMITTEES 
In many schools where committee minutes and records 
were lacking it was necessary to resort to oral statements 
for information regarding the work actually done by com- 
mittees. That was done by questioning the executives and 
committeemen and recording the data. The information 
gathered by such means is presented in Chapter III under 
the heading of “Duties of Committees as Stated by Execu- 
tive Officers, etc.” Among other questions asked consist- 
ently in securing this information was: “Who actually does 
the work which this committee is supposed to do?” With
-P-A-G-E-28

but few exceptions, the replies ranged from, “The chair- 
man does more than any one else,” to, “The chairman does 
all, or practically all, of the work.” Then, in order to secure 
further information regarding the work of the chairmen of 
committees, replies to the question, “How often does the 
committee meet?” were obtained. It was found that prac- 
tically every committee meets only at the call of the chair- 
man. It was further discovered that he calls meetings only 
when some unusual or difficult problem arises. In a num- 
ber of instances it was found that some committees had not 
held a meeting in months, and in one instance the commit- 
tee had not been called together, according to the chair- 
man’s own statement, in more than two years. During 
this period the chairman had been active in performing the 
functions of the committee. He had made a number of 
quantitative studies, issued reports,® and formulated plans 
for. the administration of the functions assigned the com- 
mittee. Not more than two or three committees in any one 
school were found which had regular times of meeting. In 
Edmond the Discipline Committee and the Athletics Com- 
mittee held regular weekly meetings; in Albany the Ap- 
pointment Committee met weekly; in Weatherford the As- 
sembly, the Calendar, and the Entrance and Credits Com- 
mittees met weekly; in Greeley the Course of Study Com- 
mittee had held biweekly meetings for some time; in a few 
schools the Registration Committee held regular meetings 
a few days before the opening of the term; in Emporia the 
Commencement Committee has been meeting at the call of 
‘the chairman a few weeks before commencement for plan- 
ning the regular programs, and again immediately follow- 
ing commencement for the purpose of hearing discussions 
on ways and means of improving the particular programs 
and the general procedure; and in most of the schools the 
Entrance and Credits Committee meets regularly on regis- 
tration day, or on the day following registration, and con- 
tinues in session from day to day until all applications have 
been disposed of. In the printed rules and regulations of 
Denton that part governing the time of meeting of the En- 
trance and Credits Committee reads: “The Committee on 
Admission and Classification is in continuous session from 
the opening date of each term until regular class work be- 
gins, and each member is expected to be present. At other 
times they are to report for committee work at the call of

the chairman.” “The registrar is chairman of the Com- 
mittee on Admission and Classification, and acts for this 
committee when it is not in session.’”’$ 
Seeing that it'is the chairman who does a very large part 
of the work of the committee, the question may be raised: 
Is the distribution of committeemen by departments, as set 
out. above, a measure of the load of the department? It is 
probable that a better measure of how well the burden of 
the load of extra-classroom activities has been distributed 
may be found in the frequency in which the various depart- 
ments of the school are represented in the chairmen of com- 
mittees. Just how well this distribution has been made 
may be seen by referring to .Table VII. In addition to 
showing how well the chairmanship has been distributed 
among the various departments, the table shows the number 
of committees on which these chairmen serve as members 
only. 
Table VII reads: In school 1 the department of Education 
is represented on committees three times as chairman and 
four times as a member only, making a total of seven times 
that the department is represented. In school 2 the de- 
partment of Education is not represented at all on the fac- 
ulty committees. In school 3 the department of Education 
is represented once in the chairmanship of a committee and 
twice as a member only, making a total of three times that 
the department is represented. In the last column to the 
right in this table is given under the “total” the number of 
times that each department is represented in the chairman- 
ship of committees and the number of times each depart- 
ment is represented on committees both as chairmen and 
members only combined. 
If, as suggested above, the representation in the chair- 
manship be taken as a better means of determining the load 
of a department and these numbers be correlated with the 
total number of faculty members by departments, the cor- 
relation by the Pearson product-moment formula is .86, 
with a P.E. of .04. From this result it would appear that 
presidents have been very successful in distributing the 
extra-classroom load among the departments of the school, 
and certainly more successful than if the total number of 
committeemen were taken as the measure. If the total 
number of times a department is represented in the chair- 
manship and the times the chairmen serve in addition as 
members of other committees are taken, the correlation is 
even more significant. The result is .87, with a P.E. of .04. 
Phe Administration of the North Texas State Normal College, p. 9. sIbid.,
-P-A-G-E-34
Administration of State Teachers Colleges 33 
But when a critical study is made of Tables [IV and VII, it 
would appear that these high correlations are due more to 
mere coincidence in the small number of cases involved than 
the actual conditions would seem to warrant. By referring 
to Table IV it will be seen that, with only five exceptions, 
every school has faculty members in the first nine depart- 
ments. But Table. VII shows that fewer than half the 
schools have the departments of Music, Physical Education, 
Home Economics, and Foreign Language represented in the 
chairmanship. -Another feature of the committee work 
which is misleading is the fact that teachers and critics in 
the training schools are seldom: placed on committees; and 
of the 643 committees of the study, they were found only 
six times as chairmen. If these critics and teachers of the 
training schools were omitted in counting the number of 
faculty members in each department, it would be found that 
the instructors in the educational subjects in the college 
proper do far more than their share of the committee work. 
6. GRouP ADVISERS 
Thus far no account has been taken of the work of class 
or group advisers. In a few schools a regular committee 
has this work in charge; in some of the larger schools the 
work is taken care of by the heads of departments; in some 
of the smaller schools special provision is made for this type 
of work. But whatever be the means for taking care of this 
work, it is of sufficient proportion and importance to demand 
a considerable amount of time of several members of the 
faculty in each school. The manner of administering this 
work in one school will illustrate in a general way the nature 
of the extra-classroom work required of those having it in 
charge. In Kearney the advisory system began by adopting 
the report of a committee which had been appointed for the 
purpose of proposing a plan to be used in the school. 
The committee appointed to plan an advisory system for the State 
Normal School at Kearney submits the following recommendations: 
. 1. .That the adviser be chosen after the matriculation and before 
the student’s first scheduling. 
2. That the advisers be those regular members of the faculty who 
are willing to act in the capacity of advisers. 
That, in view of the advisory function of training-school critics to 
the pupils under their charge, no further obligation of advisership be 
imposed upon them. By request the librarians are relieved of the 
cbligation of advisership. 
3. That the selection of adviser be left to the choice of the entering 
student, with the assistance of an advisory committee. 
4, That the advisory committee, which assists in the selection of
-P-A-G-E-35
34 Administration of State Teachers Colleges 
advisers, shall consist of three members of the faculty appointed by 
the president of the school. one 
5. That the advisees be proportioned as nearly as practicable among 
the faculty advisers, with a maximum of twenty-nine advisees for 
each adviser in the regular school year and thirty-five in the summer 
school. oe 
6. That a student may change advisers, providing that the initia- 
tive comes from the adviser, and that the change is agreeable to the 
adviser, the student, and the prospective adviser, and that such trans- 
fer shall be made under the direction of the advisory committee. 
7. That the function of the adviser be advisory and in no sense ex~ 
ecutive. 
That the adviser shall confer and advise with the student in all 
matters relating to health, living conditions, teacher-training course, 
scheduling, social life, conduct, school organizations and activities, and 
vocations. . 
That the adviser shall acquaint himself with the home conditions 
and with the previous school life of the advisee.- 
That the adviser shall endeavor to keep in touch with the advisees 
after they have left school. . 
That, upon data obtained, the adviser shall make recommendations 
to the proper executive authorities concerning the advisees.’ 
7. SUMMARY 
The data presented in this chapter deal with the number 
and size of standing committees found in the faculties of 
state teachers colleges, the relation of the number and size 
of committees to the size of the faculty, the distribution of 
the committeemen and the chairmen among the various de- 
partments of the college, and the work of the chairmen of 
the committees. : . 
Based upon the data, there is no agreement among the 
presidents as to the number or size of committees needed 
in the administration of their schools. The number used 
ranges from two to thirty-nine, with a median of sixteen. 
The median size ranges from one to six and a half, with a 
median of four and a half and modes of three and five. 
Apparently there is no significant relationship between 
the size of the school, as measured by the number of mem- 
bers in the faculty, and either the number or the size of 
committees employed by the presidents to assist in the ad- 
ministration of their schools. The fact that a school has 
an executive dean does not affect thé number of committees 
in a school. 
In a very large per cent of .the schools the work of com- 
mittees is not well distributed among the various depart- 
ments. Some departments are relieved entirely of com- 
mittee work and others are overworked. 
Committees, as a rule, have no regular time of meeting, 
*Report adopted by the faculty, October 4, 1922, and now in use.

keep no minutes or records of their activities, and make no 
written report to the president or the faculty. They meet 
rather seldom, and then at the call of the chairman. Some 
committees have not had a meeting in months, and a few 
. have had no meetings inayearormore. The chairman usu- 
ally does the work of the committee, calling the members 
together only when an unusual or difficult. problem arises or 
a special assignment is made. Thus the chairman does not 
serve as an executive of the committee, but rather he usu- 
ally does the thinking and acting for the committee. 
Many of the presidents of the schools of this study are 
failing to take advantage of their opportunities, and thus 
failing to render the state the highest and best services of 
which their present teaching staffs are capable, by failure 
to utilize the knowledge and experience of the entire faculty 
through specialized services and group judgments.

CHAPTER III : 
THE WORK OF STANDING COMMITTEES 
The chief aim of this chapter is to present a detailed 
treatment of the functions of standing committees as stated 
by presidents, deans, and committeemen, and as found in 
various kinds of school documents, including faculty and 
committee minutes, reports and recommendations of com- 
mittees, bulletins, and other printed matter prepared by 
committees. Further aims of the chapter are (1) to select, 
if possible, from the wide range of duties performed by the 
various committees, those of vital importance to the school, 
and suggest such groupings as will promote a greater effi- 
ciency without an overlapping of functions; (2) to con- 
sider the nature of the information presented by .commit- 
tees to the president and faculty, to be used by them as a 
basis for executive or legislative action; and (3) to con- 
sider the nature of the authority given committees in the 
performance of their duties. 
Since the assignment of duties to committees is bound up 
closely with the nature of the authority accompanying these 
duties, a restatement of the cardinal principles of good ad- 
ministration referred to in Chapter I will serve to assist in 
clearing up the discussions in this chapter. Those princi- 
ples commonly accepted by careful students of administra- 
tion. are: First, the principle that an executive should be 
given a wide range of authority; second, that he should be 
held responsible for results; and, third, that he should be 
charged with the responsibility of initiating new policies. 
With a view to finding what provision was being made for 
the operation of these administrative principles, which are 
applicable to both business organization and school organi- 
zation, Theisen' made an extensive investigation of the 
practices in business concerns and cities having the city- 
manager type of commission government. Among the busi- 
ness concerns were the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, the 
American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the New. 
York Central Railroad, the John Wanamaker Store, the Met- 
ropolitan Life Insurance Company, the R. H. Macy & Com- 
pany Department Stores, the Park & Tilford Stores, and the 
New York Telephone Company. After completing his study 
of these concerns, Dr. Theisen concludes: “In the field of 
business and in the city-manager form of commission gov- 
ernment we found the centralized type of organization. , We 
1Theisen, W. W.: The City Superintendent and the Board of Education, pp. 81-100.
-P-A-G-E-38
Administration of State Teachers Colleges 37 
found that each of these observes three fundamental prin- 
ciples of administration which permits of expert executive 
leadership. (1) A wide scope of authority is given to the 
chief executive in the control of other executives and in the 
direction of their duties. (2) As a counterpart to author- 
ity, responsibility for results is centered in the chief execu- 
tive. The board of control retires from active administra- 
tion, but retains ultimate control through the budget and 
through reports that must be made showing the achieve- 
ments, the business or financial status of the system. (3) 
In matters of policy the board of control demands that the 
chief executive and his assistants shall take the initiative. 
We are taught then that the form of administration 
which makes for efficiency in these fields is one that is cen- 
tralized or coérdinated. It is one in which professional 
leadership is recognized and in which executive functions 
are assigned to experts.” After a rather lengthy discus- 
sion of the functions of a board of education and the super- 
intendent, distinguishing between legislative and executive 
functions, Cubberley? says: “Such a separation of legisla- 
tive and executive functions means the selection of a prop- 
erly trained expert or experts, and then giving to such men 
both responsibility and power.” And again he says: “The 
authority to be assured the new superintendent should be 
‘commensurate with the importance of the service the board 
expects him to render to the city.” The authors of The 
Professional Preparation of Teachers fot American Public 
Schools, Bulletin No. 14, 1920, of the Carnegie Foundation 
for the Advancement of "Teaching, have this to say concern- 
ing the principle of centralization of authority: “Whatever 
steps may be taken in the name of progress in educational 
organization, it is safe to say that they will represent in 
some form the present inevitable tendency toward simplifi- 
cation by centralizing power and responsibility in the hands 
of a few individuals.”* Among other authorities empha- 
sizing these same principles of administration are W. H. 
Lough in his book, Business Finance, and E. C. Moore in 
his report as a part of the New York City School Survey, 
1911-12, entitled How New York City Administers . tts 
Schools. 
For the board of control to fail to recognize and adopt all 
or any of these principles is to handicap and greatly dimin- 
ish the efficiency of an executive in the administration of 
his school. Likewise for the president to fail to recognize

No. 14, 1920, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, p.

and apply these principles in his assignment of duties and 
delegation of authority. to his standing committees means 
that he cannot reasonably expect the greatest and most 
efficient service from these administrative groups. In a 
‘similar manner the committee should organize its group and 
put into practical operation these same principles. This 
in no way would change its relation to the president and 
faculty as an administrative body; but when it comes to 
handling matters within its own definitely assigned field, 
it should function as a legislative body also. By recogniz- 
ing and adopting these principles throughout the system, 
the board of control, with general supervisory powers, sets 
up certain general standards and prescribes certain general | 
functions for the president to perform.’ Not being able to 
perform personally all the duties assigned him, he breaks 
- them up and distributes them, or a large part of them, 
among the various standing committees. 
1. THE APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEES 
According to statements of executive officers and com- 
mitteemen in the schools, this distribution is made at va- 
rious times of the year and in at least three different: ways. 
As to the time of announcing the committees and their du- 
ties, no very definite information could be obtained. How- 
ever, in seventeen of the schools visited the list of commit- 
tees was made up in time to appear in the regular annual 
bulletin, which is usually published about the opening of the 
summer term. According to statements of some of the ex- 
ecutives, the faculty members may or may not know the per-" 
sonnel of the committees before seeing the published list. 
In the other schools the information relative to the time of 
appointing the committees was even more indefinite, rang- 
ing from the first faculty meeting of the last term of the 
year to the first regular faculty meeting. of the new year, 
with a large per cent waiting till the last date for announc- 
ing the committees. As to the ways of announcing the 
committees and their respective duties, the schools fall into 
three groups: first, those having printed rules and regula- 
tions setting forth-the duties of the various committees, | 
prepared more than three months in advance; second, those 
publishing a list of the standing committees in the annual 
bulletin, but having no printed rules and regulations; and, 
third, those in which the committees and their respective 
duties are announced orally at a faculty meeting. Table 
VIII shows this information.

Table VIII shows that in at least six schools the presi- 
dents have considered the work of standing committees of 
sufficient importance to prepare in rather detailed form the 
duties of the various committees and make these known to
-P-A-G-E-41
40 Administration of State Teachers Colleges 
the members of the faculty from three to six months prior 
to the time they were to go into effect. Of these schools, the 
procedure at Greeley is worthy of special note. A com- 
mittee of the faculty appointed by the president early in the 
fall quarter, 1921, prepared an outline of the functions of - 
each standing committee, and reported the results of its 
action to the faculty on November 30 for its approval. 
Later a list of these functions was sent to the members of 
the committees concerned for further suggestions or ap- 
proval, after which the committee made its final revision 
before publication. This is a guarantee against an over- 
lapping of duties. Every committee has a definite assign- 
ment. Each knows the nature and extent of what is ex- 
pected of it, and each feels its responsibility to the admin- 
istration. At least once a year each committee is required 
to give a summary report to the faculty of its activities dur- 
ing the year. In addition to this definite understanding on 
the part of the administration and the faculty as to what is 
to be done and who is to do it, copies of the duties of. the 
various committees are placed on the bulletin boards for the 
guidance of the students. Denton publishes the functions 
of the various faculty committees in a booklet entitled The 
Administration of the North Texas State Normal College, 
and distributes this booklet among the faculty and students. 
Warrensburg publishes the functions of those committees 
sustaining direct relations to the students in its annual bul- 
letin. Cedar Falls and Springfield have mimeographed bul- 
letins giving the functions of their committees. Kirksville 
gives the functions of its committees in typewritten form, 
and in less detail than either of the others. , 
The table further shows that in seventeen schools the 
presidents make up their lists of committees and publish 
them in the general bulletin. In some of these schools, ac- 
cording to the statements of the executive officers, a brief 
explanation of the functions of the committees is given 
orally at a faculty meeting, or at conferences with separate 
committees, or, as was shown in Chapter I, some presidents 
think that the title of the committee is sufficient to indicate 
its functions. 
The third way in which presidents announce their com- 
mittees is to read the names of the committees and the mem- 
bers composing each at a faculty meeting. No record was 
made of the exact time at which this is done; but in many 
of the seventeen schools of this group, if not a majority of 
them, this is done either at the first meeting of the year or 
the last meeting of the closing year. When this manner of
-P-A-G-E-42
Administration of State Teachers Colleges 41 
announcing the committees is used, such explanation of the 
duties is made as the case may seem to warrant. 
For the lack of data as to the exact statements of commit- 
teemen in making excuses and explanations as to why their 
committees were not functioning, two are given that seem 
to have been offered most often, “I didn’t know I was on that 
committee,” and, “I am not quite sure that I know the na- 
ture or extent of the duties of that committee.” ; 
Such practice naturally leads to indecision, inaction, and 
inefficiency. It is‘a significant fact that the members of 
committees in many schools were uncertain as to their spe- 
cific duties. In one school the dean stated: “Not half the 
committees functioned last year.”* In another instance the 
chairman of the Library Committee remarked: “In so far 
as I know, we have not had a committee meeting in more 
than two years.”®> In the case of a few committees the 
chairman goes ahead with the work assigned the committee 
without calling meetings or consulting his fellow commit- 
teemen. But the common excuse or explanation offered by 
committeemen for the state of affairs was to the effect that 
they were not asked to make reports, they had held but few 
meetings, and had kept no minutes or records of their ac- 
tivities. 
Having seen the manner in which presidents appoint 
their committees and assign them duties, the question 
arises: What are the specific duties which the presidents 
ask members of their faculties to perform? An attempt is 
made to answer that question in the following pages. 
2. DuTIES OF COMMITTEES AS STATED BY EXECUTIVE 
OFFICERS AND AS FoUND IN SCHOOL DoCUMENTS 
Upon arriving at a school, a request was made for a copy 
. of the rules and regulations governing the executive officers 
and committees of the school in the performance of their 
duties. When it was learned that there was no such docu- 
ment in the great majority of the schools, an oral statement 
of the functions of the various committees was obtained. 
But in getting this information, an apology was usually of- 
fered by the presidents to the effect that it was rather diffi- 
cult to try to recall a complete list of the duties of each and 
all committees. Not only was it a difficult matter to give these 
duties in some cases, but in two instances, where the presi- 
dents were asked to put in writing the list of committees   
4Statement of the dean to the writer, November 3, 1923. 
gagtatement of the chairman of the Library Committee to the writer, November 22,
-P-A-G-E-43
42 Administration of State Teachers Colleges 
and their functions which they had previously given orally, 
they actually gave different committees, both as to the 
number of them, their functions, and in some cases their 
names. After securing this information, permission was 
obtained to examine any and all school documents that would 
serve to show what the committees had been doing. This 
resulted in the examination of faculty minutes, committee 
minutes and records, and all reports and bulletins prepared 
by the various committees for at least the past.two years. 
In fairness to the school, it should be stated that, while doc- 
umentary evidence was not always at hand to substantiate 
all the claims made for the committees, in many instances 
there was evidence of some committees having done more 
than was claimed for them. 
Having tabulated the duties of each of the one hundred 
and eleven different kinds of committees, the first sixteen 
: committees, in their order of frequency, of occurrence in the 
_ forty-three schools, are given below in Tables IX-XXIV, 
with their respective duties, and such comments as each 
case seems to warrant. For a complete tabulated list of the 
duties of the remaining ninety-five committees the reader 
is referred to Appendix C, page 83. : 
a. The Appointment Committee—Table IX gives the 
duties summarized for this committee as stated by executive 
officers and as verified by school documents. The first duty. 
listed in the table is to “place students and alumni in teach- 
ing positions.” The first line of figures (a) under each 
duty given represents key numbers to the schools of Table 
II, and means that in those schools executive officers gave 
that particular duty as one of the duties of the Appoint- 
ment Committee. The first column of figures to the right, 
under “Executive Officers,” shows the total number of 
schools in which executive officers gave that particular duty 
as one of the duties of the Appointment Committee. The 
second line of figures (b) under each duty represents the 
same schools in Table II, and means that in those schools 
documents were found showing that the Appointment Com- 
mittee had actually performed that particular duty. And 
the last column of figures to the right, under “School Doc- 
uments,” shows the total number of schools in which docu- 
ments were found showing that the Appointment Commit- 
tee had performed the particular duty.

Table Ix reads: In 31 schools the executive officers gave. 
as one of the duties of the Appointment. Committee to 
“place students and alumni in teaching positions,” and in 29 
of these schools documentary evidence was found verifying 
these statements; in.4 schools the.executive officers gave as 
another duty of this committee to “keep in touch with those 
teaching,” and in the same 4 schools documentary evi- 
dence was found showing that these committees had per- 
formed that duty. 
This table shows, first, that the schools are practically in 
accord in requiring the Appointment Committee to find suit- 
able teaching positions for their students and their alumni; 
second, that either keeping in touch with those whom 
schools have placed. in teaching positions is not essential or 
important, or some one else is charged with looking after 
that matter, or apparently the schools are negligent in keep- 
ing in touch with their former students. In recent years 
alumni of higher institutions throughout the country have 
heard the call and felt the pressure to rally to the support 
of their Alma Mater. On this basis alone, keeping in touch 
with former students may be interpreted as, being an im- 
portant phase of school administration. As to the second 
alternative, facts bear’ out the statement that the Alumni 
Committee, which appears in only 18 schools of this study, 
is the only other committee charged with such a duty. But 
of the 18 schools, only 3 have assigned to that committee   
*The rows of numbers refer to schools as numbered-in Table II.
-P-A-G-E-45
44 Administration of State Teachers Colleges 
the duty of keeping in touch with former students by means 
of some “follow-up” plan. However, 12 of the 13 schools 
having the Alumni Committee have assigned to it the duty 
of “planning dinners and promoting alumni organizations.” 
Thus it would appear that the schools have been somewhat 
negligent in this phase of their work. Since the duties of 
the two committees are so closely associated, they may well 
be combined and the functions of the one committee set out 
fully and clearly. . 
b. The Athletics Committee-——Table X gives the duties 
of the Athletics Committee as stated by executive officers 
and as verified by school documents.’ The executive offi- 
cers in 26 of the schools having this committee gave as one 
of its duties: “Make or approve schedules.” In 10 of these 
schools documentary evidence was found showing that the 
committee had performed that duty. The remainder of the 
duties of the table are read in a similar manner; also Ta- 
bles XI-XXIV are to be read in like manner.

Administration of State Teachers Colleges 45 
The first point in connection with the duties of the 
Athletics Committee that may be noticed is the lack of 
committee requirement relative to the function of initiat- 
ing new policies in its field of activities. Only 11 schools 
out of a possible 31 have recognized this principle of ad- 
ministration and so stated it in connection with the du- 
ties assigned the committee. In the second place, it would 
appear that this. committee devotes most of its time to func- 
tions on which group judgments are not essential. Approv- 
ing schedules, enforcing regulations, making rewards based 
upon records kept, and supervising contests, are, from their 
very nature, usually classed as executive functions, and 
would permit of execution by an individual as well as by a 
group. If committee action is limited to executive func- 
tions, the work of the Athletics Committee. may well be - 
performed by an individual—-preferably the one in charge 
of physical education, or the athletic coach.

c. The Curriculum Committee—Table XI gives similar 
facts concerning the committee on the courses of study 
that Table IX gives on the Appointment Committee. The 
provision for committee participation in “formulating 
and revising professional curricula” is the most common 
duty assigned the Curriculum Committee, occurring 25 
times in a possible 28. Aside from this single exception, 
there is little agreement among the schools as to the du- 
ties that should be assigned this committee. Some schools 
‘assign duties to the Curriculum Committee that are as- 
signed by other schools to the Committee on Schedules or 
the one on degrees and diplomas. 
It cannot in every instance be stated positively that the 
committee had or had not before it underlying principles 
‘for guiding it in formulating or revising the curricula 
for the school. However, the raré instances in which any 
evidence was found either in school documents or else- 
where seem significant. In only one instance—Gree- 
ley‘—-was there found documentary evidence showing that 
the committee had actually adopted guiding principles for 
the formation and revision of curricula. In two others— 
Emporia‘ and Kirksvilles—executive officers indicated that 
this committee was usually governed by certain principles 
and standards. 
_In Greeley the Course of Study Committee, before at- 
tempting to revise old or formulate new curricula, adopted 
certain, definite principles for its guidance. These princi- 
ples were submitted to other faculty members for criticism 
and suggestions.and finally to the faculty for its approval. 
In their completed form, these principles were set out in 
detail under three general heads: first, “General Principles 
Underlying Curriculum Making;” second, “Principles De- 
termining the Content of the Curricula ;’” third, “Principles 
* Determining the Organization of the Activities Provided 
for by the Curricula.” It should not be construed that this 
procedure is to take the place of a comprehensive study of 
practice in similar institutions and of the many rich and 
timely suggestions of experts in the field of normal school 
administration; but it is reasonable to believe that the cur- 
ricula in the state teachers colleges would better serve their 
purpose if some such procedure were adopted by those 
charged with the responsibility of preparing these curricula.

48 Administration of State Teachers Colleges’ 
Only the first duty listed in Table XII is. assigned to this 
committee by a majority of the schools. On all others they 
fail to agree, even to forty per cent in case of the most com- 
mon duty. It may appear that certain combinations could 
be made which would tend to give the appearance that there 
is more nearly agreement among the schools. For exam- . 
ple, No. 10 is substantially the same as No. 1; but in the 
former it is the practice of schools 837 and 39—Richmond 
and Springfield, respectively—to leave to the registrar of. 
the college the evaluating, approving, and distributing of. 
credits in all regular applications, and reserve for the com- 
mittee the duty of handling the irregular applications. 
Among the remaining duties listed may be found those often 
performed by the Registration Committee, the Schedule 
Committee, or some other committee. In the second place, 
except for the two schools which delegate to this committee 
the power to “make rules and regulations for admitting 
students,” there seems to be no indication that the Entrance 
and Credits Committee is expected to take the initiative in - 
proposing new policies or in exercising the power of legis- 
Jating on matters within its jurisdiction and not covered by 
the general regulations laid down by the board of control 
and the president and faculty. In the third place, it is com- 
mon practice for this committee to call meetings for the 
purpose of passing on individual applications. There are at 
least two probable causes for this practice. First, it may 
be due to the fact that the chairman of the committee is not 
an expert in this field. There is no agreement among the 
schools having this committee as to who should be chairman. 
Of the 27 schools in which the Entrance and Credits Com- 
mittee “evaluates, approves, or distributes credits,” only 5° 
have made the registrar chairman.of the committee. The 
other 21 schools have distributed the chairmanship as fol- 
lows: dean, 7; social science, 4; education, 3; science, 3; 
foreign language, 2; president, 1; and vice-president, 1. 
However, it is significant that some schools are recogniz- 
ing the registrar as the one to handle the applications for 
admission that are regular and leave to the committee those 
demanding special consideration. Such is the case in 
Springfield. Within the past year Richmond asked the 
registrar to handle all regular applications and leave to the 
committee those that do not come within the general re- 
quirements of the schoolt¢ Only recently in Bowling 
Green, Ky., where all applications have been handled by the 
dean, the duty of “evaluating, approving, and distributing   
*Alva, Denton, Durant, Emporia, and Ypsilanti. “Statement of the dean to the writer, January 25, 1924.
-P-A-G-E-50
Administration of State Teachers Colleges 49 
credits” on applications which appear regular has been ° 
transferred to the registrar and those of a special nature 
only left for the dean! There appears to be a tendency 
to recognize the registrar as an expert in the field of han- 
dling credits. A second probable cause for the practice of 
this committee’s calling meetings for the purpose of pass- 
ing on individual applications is due to the fact that it does 
not function as a legislative body within its own field of 
activities. In Chapter IV, under the heading of “Authority 
Delegated to Standing Committees,” it is shown that these 
committees are organized and that they function as admin- 
istrative bodies, with the chairman possessing authority no 
different in quantity or kind, outside of presiding over com- 
mittee meetings, from that of other members of the com- 
mittee; whereas, if the principles of administration set 
forth in the beginning of this chapter were in practical op- 
eration, the committee would retire from active administra- 
tion of the committee’s activities, recognize the chairman as 
its chief executive, and meet only for the purpose of legis- 
lating on matters determining the committee’s policy and 
considering reports and recommendations of its chief exec- 
utive. The registrar of the college is the logical person by 
virtue of his position for this chairmanship. 
. e. The Entertainment and Lyceum Committee —Table 
XIII gives the duties as summarized for the Entertainment 
and Lyceum Committee. The schools are almost unani- 
mous in their assignment of duties to this committee. That 
this committee has more freedom in the performance of its 
duties than most committees have may be inferred from 
the statement of the first duty listed in the table.. Unlike 
most of the committees, its responsibility is balanced with 
a‘ wide range of authority. With only one exception—-Ed- 
mond!?—it has a free hand in making contracts for enter- 
tainment and lyceum courses and in saying how they shall 
be administered. : 
In school No. 9—Cedar Falls—this committee has the 
additional duty of providing motion picture entertainments, 
In each of four other schools—East Radford, Emporia, Gree- 
ley, and Macomb—there is, in addition to the Entertainment 
and Lyceum Committee, a Committee on Motion Pictures. 
The duties of these committees being so closely related per- 
mits of their being merged and functioning as one commit- 
tee.

  f. The Social Committce—The duties of the Social Com- 
mittee are summarized in Table XIV. In 21 schools the 
executive officers gave as a duty of this committee, “Plan, 
approve, advise concerning, or supervise social activities of 
the students,” and in 12,of those schools documentary evi- 
dence was found showing that the committee had performed 
that duty. 
The. most striking thing to be noted about this committee 
is the lack of agreement among the schools as to what du- 
ties should be assigned to it. Of the nine duties listed in 
the table, only two ‘appear in more than 8 schools out of a 
possible 25. The second duty listed in Table XIV is found 
as one of the duties of the Student Activities Committee in 
Edmond, Greenville, and Peru. In Maryville the same duty 
is assigned to the Student Welfare Committee. To “visit 
rooming and boarding houses and make up an approved 
list” is one of the duties assigned to the Student Welfare 
Committee in Maryville, Normal, and Peru, and in 7 other 
schools this part of the work is handled by the Board and 
Room Committee. Item 4 may well be taken care of by the 
general regulations of the college. Apparently the other 
duties listed in the table are of such nature as to be han- 
dled as well by an individual as by a group.

  g. Other Committees—Without going into a detailed 
analysis of each committee, it will suffice to say that in gen- 
eral the conditions existing with regard: to the committees 
in Tables IX-XIV hold true for all the committees in this 
study. Briefly, those conditions are: first, failure on the 
part of the presidents. to apply recognized principles of ad- 
ministration in the organization of standing committees and 
in the assignment of duties to them; and, second, the as- 
signment of duties to committees without having them set 
forth fully, clearly, and in detailed form. Those remaining 
of the sixteen committees, with their duties as given by ex- 
ecutive officers and as found in school documents, are given 
below without comment.

3. ESSENTIAL OR DESIRABLE ACTIVITIES NOT INCLUDED 
IN THE SIXTEEN COMMITTEES 
* On account of the way in which the activities have been 
divided up and assigned to committees, some very essential 
matters have: been omitted. For example, it is not only 
desirable, but essential, that a teacher training institution 
have.a.demonstration and practice school. The North Cen-

tral Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools has set 
up as one of the standards for institutions primarily for the 
training of teachers: “Such schools shall provide adequate 
_ facilities for practice teaching and observation.”** In Bul- 
letin No. 14, 1920, of the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad- 
- vancement of Teaching, the authors say: “The training 
school constitutes the characteristic laboratory equipment 
of the normal school or teachers college, and the courses in 
observation, participation, and practice teaching should be 
looked upon as the central and critical elements in each of 
the curricula.’”+ In this. same reference the authors. have 
this to say about securing codperation in the administration 
of the training school by a committee: “A second difficulty 
lies in the practical impossibility of administering a prac- 
tice school on the committee plan. Here centralized au- 
thority, balanced by centralized responsibility, is a sine qua 
non of efficiency.”15 The answer to what the authors term . 
“impossible” is found in their last sentence. In the ap- 
pointment of committees and assignment. of duties, presi- 
dents have not recognized the fundamental principles of 
good administration as referred to at the beginning of this 
chapter. They have not centralized authority or held the. 
committees responsible for results. They have not been ° 
specific and detailed ‘in their assignment of duties. By or- 
ganizing the training school committee as a board of edu- 
cation, with the director of the training school as chairman, 
and applying the principles of centralization of authority 
and responsibility as “the sine qua non of efficiency,” and 
then designating the chairman as the one to initiate new 
policies for the training school, results may be expected. 
By this means the training school will be under the direct 
_ control and supervision of an expert administrator fitted 
by experience and training for this particular type of work. 
Another standard set up by the North Central Associa- 
tion for teacher training institutions has to do with: the 
buildings and grounds and their hygienic conditions. Some 
presidents have assigned the duty of beautifying the build- 
‘ings and grounds and keeping them in repair and in sanitary 
condition to a committee on buildings and grounds. The 
need of a committee to look after this particular work is all 
the more apparent since pressure is being brought on health 
and sanitation as never before. Applying the same princi- 
ples of organization to this committee as to the one in charge

of the training school, the logical person for its chairman is 
the superintendent of the buildings and grounds or some 
one holding such a position. . 
Two other groups of activities that are very desirable and 
essential in keeping up the “tone of the institution” are (1) 
those which have to do with the welfare of the student body, 
including their health, comfort, social environment, and de- 
sirable rooming and boarding conditions, and (2) those 
which have to do with giving financial assistance to the 
needy and deserving students. The committee in charge 
of the first may be called the “Student Welfare Committee,” 
and the one in charge of the second the “Scholarships, Loan 
Fund, and Self-Help Committee.” Each of these should 
organize and function as indicated for the other committees. 
4. NATURE OF DATA PRESENTED AS A BASIS FOR 
EXECUTIVE OR LEGISLATIVE ACTION 
Granted that proper committee organization is essential 
to a practical operation of the fundamental principles of 
administration, and that the grouping of certain related 
duties makes for better efficiency, yet a school may fail to 
” render its best services to the community on account of the 
standards adopted relative to an important phase of school 
administration concerned with the nature and extent of the 
data offered by committees and required by executives and 
used as a basis for executive and legislative action. Is the 
opinion of some influential member of a faculty sufficient’ 
information to settle a question which affects the policy of 
the school—namely, establishing a precedent by giving 
credit for an unauthorized type of extension work, especially 
when it is known that that member is not an expert in that 
field either by experience or training?'* Or is the report 
and recommendation of a committee. on revising the course 
of study sufficient data for legislative action, when that 
_. report was based upon a very fragmentary investigation of 
practice in a few other similar institutions? Briefly, the 
procedure in revising the course of study in one state teach- 
ers college of this study, as described by the president of 
that institution,!7 was: A reorganized program of studies, 
based upon legal requirements and _a catalog investigation 
of what a few similar institutions were doing, was prepared 
by a committee, or a member of the committee; and after 
a brief explanation and debate, resulting in.a few changes,

-P-A-G-E-60
Administration of State Teachers Colleges , 59 
the committee turned the manuscript over to the president 
for the catalog. Contrast with that the procedure of the 
Curriculum Committee in Albany, where a subcommittee 
was appointed to go into detail with reference to statutory 
requirements, institutional practices, and expert opinion, 
and, after weeks of work, report back to the whole commit- 
tee on the task assigned for criticisms and suggestions. 
Then in due course the committee recommended its findings 
and conclusions to the faculty for approvals As a further 
example of what may be considered a case in which ade- 
quate statistical data were gathered and presented by a com- 
mittee as a basis for its recommendation and faculty action, 
note the procedure of the Research Committee in the school 
at Greeley preparatory to making recommendations to the 
faculty relative to standards for determining the collegiate 
rank of subjects. Quotations from the introduction to the 
report as made by the committee will show the nature and 
extent of the data collected as a basis for its recommenda- 
tions: , . 
During the winter quarter of 1922 the Course of Study Committee 
of Colorado State Teachers College found itself embarrassed in its 
endeavor to revise the curricula of the college by the lack of any 
specific statement of standards determining the collegiate rank of sub- 
jects. Realizing that personal opinion and fragmentary report of 
practices in other institutions were unsatisfactory bases for the reor- 
ganization of a course of study, the faculty voted on April 19, 1922, to 
give college credit for only those subjects which are of collegiate rank 
and to request the Research Committee to formulate standards for 
determining the collegiate rank of subjects.. On April 29, 1922, the 
Research Committee appointed as a ‘subcommittee to conduct this 
study two of its members. . . . This subcommittee began its work 
at once, and on April 25, 1922, submitted the following statement of 
its plan of work: . 
To the Research Committee : . 
Your Subcommittee on Standards for Determining Collegiate Rank of Subjects 
reports the following as its tentative plan of work: 
Time.—We will endeavor to secure’ during the present: quarter the materials 
needed for the study, and in the fall of 1922 will proceed as far as possible to conclu- 
sions. 
Methods—

offering work that falls within the scope of our inquiry. 
2. Interviews with local college teachers and with educational visitors, in order 
to obtain their views and leads toward the formulation of the standards.

This plan was approved by the Research Committee on April 25, 
1922. The subcommittee has followed this procedure, with the addi- 
tion of a questionnaire sent to higher institutions.   
Report of the Curriculum Committee, February 5, 1923,
-P-A-G-E-61

During the spring and summer of 1922 the subcommittee inter- 
viewed some members of the faculty of Colorado State Teachers Col- 
lege, corresponded with national leaders in education, and gathered the 
material listed in the bibliography at the close of this report. 
On October 26, 1922, the following communication was sent to 
thirty-five heads of departments and other interested members of the 
college faculty, . .-. . 
On November 2, 1922, a questionnaire was addressed to all the high 
schools of, Colorado, seventy-six in number. Its purpose was to ascer- 
tain the scope and nature of work offered in the high schools, for the 
purpose of determining the relations of the college courses to secondary 
work. . woe . 
The results of these conferences and the returns from question- 
naires have been tabulated and studied, and conclusions have been 
formulated by the subcommittee. ‘These, in turn, have been discussed 
by the Research Committee, and are presented in the succeeding pages as approved by that committee. 
The study itself is as pretentious as this introduction 
would seem to indicate. m 
In both Albany and Greeley the executive heads have 
availed themselves of the expert services of certain members 
of their faculties and profited by group judgments in mat- 
ters of vital importance to the best interests of their schools, 
the communities which they serve, and to education at large. 
These cases are indicative of what may-be accomplished by 
recognizing and applying the principles of administration 
referred to in the beginning of this chapter. : 
A further illustration of what may be termed poor ad-. 
ministrative practice was noted in a school where the Li- 
brary Committee!® asked for a lump sum of money for pur- 
chasing books and magazines on the grounds of having re- 
ceived that amount the previous year. Compare that with 
the practice in Kirksville, where the Library Committee** 
first ascertained the number of volumes and magazines 
needed in each of the-eighteen departments of the college 
and the children’s library, based upon the current enrollment 
in the school; then after deducting the number of volumes 
on hand in each of the departments, distributed the amount 
allotted to the library on a proportiona! basis of actual needs, 
including binding, .periodicals, and supplies. In another 
school it was very noticeable, in looking through the stacks, 
that two or three departments had more than their share of 
the books. Upon questioning the librarian as to the pro- 
cedure followed in adding new books to the library, she ex- - 
plained that they tried to buy all the books for which the : 
instructors made special requests.2t Further questions

brought out the fact that some instructors, whose depart- — 
ments were very poorly represented on the shelves of the 
_ library, had not made a request for books in more than a 
year. 
It was shown in Chapter II that the average number of 
standing committees per school is sixteen. It is a rather 
significant fact that not as many as four committees per 
school on an average could be found that presented to the 
president and faculty what may very liberally be called 
“statistical” or “quantitative” data as a basis for their rec- 
ommendations. It may be maintained with some fairness 
that’ oral reports, explanations, and discussions were not 
recorded in the faculty minutes, and, therefore, were not 
available for this study. However, the absence of these 
reports and of rules and. regulations requiring that com- 
mittees present quantitative material as a basis for their 
action is circumstantial evidence that many presidents are 
not availing themselves of all possible sources for informa- 
tion for the purpose of making their schools the most effi-

The final, and probably the most important, test of effi- 
‘ciency of committee organization and administration will 
rest upon the nature of the authority possessed by commit- 
tees in the performance of their duties. They may have a 
full, complete, and detailed list of the duties they are to per- 
form; but if they are handicapped and embarrassed for lack 
of freedom in handling the matters assigned to them, and 
labor with the feeling that criticisms and suggestions are 
not desired on the part of the administration, sooner or later 
these ambitious faculty members will revolt, make a change 
of work, or resort to indifference and submit to blind obe- 
dience. 
Before considering the specific nature of the authority 
delegated to. standing committees, it may be well to-call at- 
‘tention again to the administrative principles referred to at 
the beginning of the chapter. 
1. That the president, as the executive head of the school, 
should be given a wide scope of authority over the affairs of 
the institution. 
2. That he should be held responsible for results. 
8. That he is the proper one to propose. new policies for . 
the general welfare of the school. 
Just as failure on the part of the board of control to rec- 
ognize and adopt all or any of these principles is to handicap
-P-A-G-E-63
62 Administration of State Teachers Colleges 
the president in the administration of the school, so will 
failure on the part of the president to recognize and apply 
these same principles in the delegation of authority to his 
standing committees mean that he cannot reasonably expect 
the greatest and most efficient services from these adminis- 
trative groups. And as the president is responsible to the 
board of control, and the committee to the president and 
faculty, so the chairman of the committee, as its executive 
officer, should be responsible to the committee. By this 
means the committee is empowered with both administrative 
and legislative functions—administrative in its relation to 
the president and faculty, and legislative in its powers to 
work out in detail its particular functions, and to hear, dis- 
cuss, and pass upon reports and recommendations of its 
chairman as its chief executive officer. 
With these principles in mind as a basis for a critical ex- 
amination of the nature of the authority delegated by presi- 
dents to the committees of the faculty and as criteria for 
judging as to the proper functions of a committee, what 
authority have committees over matters in their specific 
fields of activities? To what extent is a committee held re- 
‘sponsible for efficient results? Who, if any one, has the 
responsibility of initiating new policies in a particular field? 
Then, shifting the viewpoint from that of the president and 
’ his committee to the committee and its chairman, what 
authority and what responsibility has the chairman relative 
to matters within the field of the committee’s functions? 
To what extent is the chairman of a committee held respon- 
sible for proposing new policies in the particular field? 
(a) NaTURE oF Powers GIVEN COMMITTEES 
When the presidents were asked if their committees were 
advisory or administrative bodies, a frequent answer was to 
the effect that they were advisory committees. One presi- 
dent, however, went so far as to say: “My committees are all 
administrative; I don’t need anybody to advise me how to run 
this school.”22. But a more typical answer received from a 
large per cent of the presidents was: “It will suffice, I think, 
to say that our committees have only advisory powers so 
far as faculty action is concerned.’’2? Based upon further 
replies to questions in an attempt to understand the nature 
of the authority delegated to committees for the perform- 
ance of their duties, the following generalization is made: 
Committees appointed either by the president or the faculty 
  
“Statement of president to the writer, December 7. 19238. 
“Letter of the president to the writer, March 38, 1924.
-P-A-G-E-64
Administration of State Teachers Colleges 63 
’ for the purpose of making studies and reports, subject to the 
final action of the president-or the faculty, have advisory 
powers only. But committees appointed by the president, 
as executive head of the school, to assist in performing ad- 
ministrative functions for him, are administrative bodies, 
possessing powers of a very indefinite and uncertain nature. 
In the first instance, where the faculty is functioning as a 
. legislative body, a sound principle of business administra- 
tion is followed in considering its committees advisory and 
not executive bodies.2+ If, in the second case, the commit- 
tees are given powers commensurate with their responsi- 
bilities and are made to feel that the initiative in new pol- 
icies in-their particular fields should come from them, other 
sound principles of administration are recognized and fol- 
lowed. : . . 
Based upon statements of executive officers of the schools 
and the nature of the activities of the various committees, 
Table XXV shows the nature of the authority delegated by 
the presidents to the committees for the performance of 
their duties. In some instances personal opinion entered in 
determining the kind of authority given a committee. 
Sometimes the statement of a president and the chairman 
of a committee were not in accord. In such cases it was 
necessary to decide the nature of the authority exercised 
by the committee by determining who made the final dispo- 
sition of the matters in question. For example, a commit- 
tee may have both advisory and administrative powers rela- 
tive to the same matter. In Edmond the Entertainment and 
Lyceum Committee was not empowered to close a contract .- 
with a company for an attraction without first getting the 
approval of the president; but when the contract had been 
made, the committee was empowered to administer the en- 
tertainment as it thought best; or a committee may act in 
an administrative and legislative capacity, as in Peru, where 
the Library Committee handles all textbooks as it thinks 
best without consulting any one, and at the same time this . 
committee makes the rules and regulations governing stu- 
dent and faculty members in the use of the library. 
Table XXV reads: Of the 31 schools having the Appoint- 
ment Committee, no president requires this committee to 
_ submit its lists and recommendations to him or other higher 
authority before it can act. All presidents say that this 
committee has administrative powers, and that it may act 
upon its own initiative in placing students and alumni in 
teaching positions; but, no president gives this committee

the power to legislate on matters within its own field. The

    That the standing committees in the state teachers col- 
leges are administrative bodies is evidenced by the nature 
of the powers delegated to them by the presidents of the 
institutions. With only two exceptions—the Curriculum 
Committee and the Degrees and Diplomas Committee—the 
committees in Chapter XXV function in an administrative 
capacity. Making curriculums and passing on applications 
for certificates, diplomas, and degrees seem to be regarded 
as functions of the faculty, with the committees serving in 
an advisory capacity. If the duties of the Degrees and Di- 
plomas Committee were transferred to the registrar, where 
many students* of administration place them, only the Cur- 
riculum Committee would serve as an advisory body. Not 
many of the schools permit their committees to legislate on 
matters within their specific fields. The Library Committee 
seems to be the only one accredited with this power. Six- 
teen schools, in a possible twenty-three, have delegated to 
it the power to say how the library shall be administered. 
The Discipline Committee is the only one having the distinc- 
tion of possessing judicial powers. It is very probable that, 
wherever this committee really functions, it sits as a court 
of inquiry, in’a greater or less degree. The printed rules 
and regulations for the school at Denton reads: “The Disci- 
pline Committee is a court of inquiry and of trial. It inves- 
tigates charges of breach of the regulations of the institu- 
tion; of conduct unbecoming gentlemen and ladies, giving 
a fair hearing to students charged with infractions; assesses 
punishment for infractions; and recommends to the presi- 
dent the suspension, dismissal, or expulsion of a student 
when it has been decided that such action should be taken.””> 
It is evident from the nature of the authority given com- 
mittees in the performance of their duties that the princi- 
ples referred to above have not been applied. In only seven 
  
In his Schedule of Work for the Registrar, ©. L. Gillis places these duties as a 
part of. the registrar's work.

‘of the twenty-two committees listed in Table XXV. are there 
schools where the committees have the power to legislate on 
matters pertaining to their activities. This may mean that 
all details relative to their duties have been worked out, or 
it may. mean that some things are left undecided and undone. 
Since but few schools have worked out the functions of their 
committees in detail and placed them in the hands of the 
committees, the presumption is not in favor of the former. 
Coupled with this the fact that in those schools where the 
duties of the committees have been worked out in detail they 
have most to show as to what has been done, the conclusion 
is that where little authority is given and little responsibil- 
ity is placed, only minimum results may reasonably be ex- 
pected: . 
6. SUMMARY 
An attempt has been made in this chapter to present a 
detailed treatment of the duties of standing committees as 
stated by presidents, deans, and committeemen, and as found | 
in various kinds of school ‘documents, including faculty. and 
committee minutes, committee reports and recommenda- 
tions, bulletins and other printed matter prepared by com- 
mittees, and-rules and regulations for the guidance of offi- 
cials and committees in the performance of their duties. 
As a basis for discussion of the functions of standing 
committees, and as criteria in judging committee organiza- 
tion and administration, attention is called to certain fun- 
damental principles of good administration. Adapted to the. 
problems of this study, those principles are: first, a presi- 
dent should have a wide range of authority over his school; 
second, he should be held responsible for results; and, third, 
he should be charged with the responsibility of initiating 
new policies in his school. It was discovered that presi- 
dents, as a rule, do not recognize these principles in the ap- 
pointment of committees and assignment of duties. It was 
further discovered that in the type of committee organiza- 
tion which prevails, the chairman, outside of being the pre- 
siding officer of a committee, is regarded as any. other mem- 
ber of the committee, so far as his duties and powers are 
concerned. In order that the principles of centralization 
of authority and responsibility shall be efficiently applied, 
the committee should function as a board of control in its 
particular field of activities, recognizing the chairman as its 
executive officer, and retire from the active administration 
of the committee’s work, but. retain ultimate control through 
the consideration of reports and recommendations of its
-P-A-G-E-69
68 Administration of State Teachers Colleges 
executive officer and such legislation as the nature of its 
functions may demand. 
From the data presented it was noted that only six of the 
schools have any printed rules and regulations giving the 
duties of the various committees of the faculty. Of the re- 
mainder, seventeen publish the names of the committees in 
their annual bulletins, without giving the functions of the 
committees, and seventeen announce the committees and 
their membership at faculty meetings. It is a. significant 
fact that, with only a few exceptions, only in those schools 
where the duties of the committees were published did com- 
mitteemen seem to know at least in a general way the nature 
and extent of their duties. 
It was observed that there is a striking lack of agreement 
among the schools as to what committees should exist in a 
state teachers college and what duties should be assigned 
to each. There are 111 different committees in the schools 
of the study, with. an average of 16 to the school. In the 
case of some committees many combinations of duties are 
found, often unrelated and detached. It would appear that 
presidents, as a rule, give too little attention to the impor- 
tant duty of outlining the functions of these committees. 
They would do well to associate with them a committee of 
the faculty whose duties should be to determine what com- 
mittees should exist and what functions should be assigned 
_to each. In addition, this committee might serve as a body 
for the purpose of checking, auditing, assembling, and mak- 
ing available to all other committees the work of any and all 
committees of the faculty, and thus guarantee against snap 
judgments, hasty and indefinite assignments, overlapping of 
duties, overloading of some departments, and fragmentary 
and superficial reports and recommendations. 
The nature of the data presented by committees and ac- 
cepted by the president and faculty to be used as a basis for 
executive or legislative action has often been fragmentary . 
and superficial, and in most cases the data were lacking al- 
together. Either presidents have not required committees 
to make a full and complete investigation of available 
sources relative to matters assigned them, or have not 
deemed it necessary to keep records of their findings and 
recommendations, as records of all kinds showed less than 
thirty-five per cent of the committees making any sort of 
statistical or quantitative study on matters assigned them. 
But committees in a large per cent of the schools were prac- 
tically unanimous in saying that no minutes or written re- 
ports were required of them. It would appear that in the
-P-A-G-E-70
Administration of State Teachers Colleges 69 
face of these conditions many of the presidents are falling 
short of their opportunities in not requiring of committees 
full and complete investigations of problems assigned them 
before making any report or recommendation and in not 
keeping a record of the results for future reference. 
Finally, it was discovered that, with but few exceptions, 
the presidents recognize the standing committees as ad- 
ministrative bodies, but do not always give them authority 
commensurate with the responsibilities placed upon them. 
In only a few instances are committees given the power of 
legislating relative to matters within their fields. In some 
instances committees had not felt the pressure sufficiently 
even to hold meetings, much less. keep records and make 
reports. Less than one-third of the committees keep any 
sort of minutes or records of their activities. In general, 
it would appear that presidents fail to apply the recognized 
principles of good administration in delegating authority 
to their committees, fail to get what would seem to be sat- 
isfactory results from the various administrative groups, 
and, therefore, fail to render the community the service to 
which it is entitled. .

CHAPTER IV 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
- Summary.—tin this study an attempt has been made to 
discover how presidents of state teachers colleges admin- 
ister their schools through standing committees of the fac- 
ulty. No attempt has been made to say what the functions 
of the president should be. But, accepting as essential the 
duties which he is called upon to perform, how many and 
what committees does he have to assist him in the adminis- 
tration of the school, and what are the functions of each? 
When does he appoint his committees, and how does he no- 
tify them of their appointment? How well does he distribute 
the load of committee work among the various departments 
of his school? What is the nature of the work of the chair- 
men as compared with the other members of the commit- 
tees? How often do the committees meet, and what kind 
of records do they keep? What is the nature of the reports 
and recommendations which they make to the president and 
faculty? And, finally, what is the nature of the authority 
delegated to these committees in the performance of their 
duties? By combining the results of what was found in 
practice relative to each of the above questions, we have 
what is commonly termed by students of statistical methods 
a typical school. Those findings may be summarized in the 
form of a description of the typical school organization 
with regard to the standing committees of the faculty, and 
stated somewhat as follows: 
In this typical school the president makes up‘ his list of 
faculty committees near the end of the year, and either 
publishes this list in the annual catalog, without indicating 
what their respective duties are, or announces the list. 
orally at a faculty meeting, making such comments and 
explanations as the individual cases seem to demand. There 
are sixteen standing committees, with from three to five 
members on each committee. Among these committees are 
commonly found one oh athletics, teacher placement, en- 
trance and credits, curriculum, social affairs, entertain- 
ments, library, publications, assembly, registration, student 
activities, extension and correspondence, student publica- 
tions, schedules and examinations, alumni, and student or- 
ganizations. The committeemen are chosen disproportion- 
ately from the departments of the college, with the older 
and major departments of the school contributing consid- 
erably more than their share, with the heaviest burden fall-
-P-A-G-E-72
Administration of State Teachers Colleges . 71 
ing on the department of education. The committees sel- 
dom hold meetings, and then only when some unusual or 
difficult problem arises. In the meantime the chairmen 
of the committees perform such duties as the exigencies of 
the case may demand. With the exception of the commit- 
tees handling the students’ applications for entrance and 
the placing of students and alumni in teaching positions, 
the committees in this typical school keep no minutes or 
records of their activities, and fewer than one-third have 
any documentary evidence to show that results have been 
achieved. They are not required to make full, accurate, 
objective reports on their achievements or concerning mat- 
ters on which they make recommendations as a basis for 
executive or legislative action. These committees are rec- 
ognized by the president and faculty as administrative bod- 
ies, but are not given authority in the performance of their 
duties commensurate with their responsibilities. They are 
not charged with the duty of initiating new policies in their 
respective fields. It seems that the president does not con- 
sider it essential that the fundamental principles of good 
administration shall apply to his committees—namely, the 
balancing of. responsibility with an equal amount of au- 
thority. Apparently he does not expect his committees to 
propose new policies concerning the duties assigned them. 
Conclusions.—F rom the data presented in this study the 
following conclusions seem warranted: 
1. It was discovered that presidents of state teachers 
colleges are at a wide variance as to what faculty commit- 
tees should exist in their institutions, the number ranging 
.from two to thirty-nine, with a median of sixteen. 
2. It would appear that the presidents have given too lit- 
tle attention to the important duty of outlining the func- 
tions of the faculty committees who are to assist them in 
the administration of their schools. It was discovered in 
many instances that the duties of committees were over- 
lapping and not wéll defined. 
3. That the presidents have not generally recognized in 
practice what are commonly termed by careful students of 
administration “the cardinal principles of good adminis- 
tration.” That efficient results can be obtained by giving 
an executive, whether an individual or a group, large pow- 
ers over matters assigned to him, holding him strictly re- 
sponsible for results and designating him as the one to pro- 
pose new policies for his particular field, has. been amply 
demonstrated in business administration.
-P-A-G-E-73
72 Administration of State Teachers Colleges 
4. That the type of committee organization practiced in 
the schools of this study is not conducive to best -efforts. 
It is loose and permits of a shifting of responsibility. The 
chairman should be more than a presiding officer at com- 
mittee meetings. He should be chosen for his expert fitness 
for the particular work, and recognized as the chief execu- 
tive of the committee. | 
Further and more detailed recommendations will be pre- 
sented in the form of a proposed set of principles and stand- 
ards for governing a president of a state teachers college 
in the administration of his school through faculty commit- 
tees. : : 
SUGGESTED STUDIES 
Since this study is one of a group of closely related prob- 
lems, all of which center around the larger problem of the 
administration of a state teachers college, it is suggested 
that a study be made of— 
1. The functions of a president of a state teachers college. 
2. The functions of a dean of a state teachers college. 
3. The functions of a registrar of a state teachers college.

PRESIDENT OF A STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE IN THE AP- 
POINTMENT OF AND DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO 
STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE FACULTY 
A. Organization and Guiding Principles 
By legislative (or constitutional) enactment, the college 
is under the general management and supervision of a state 
board of control, whose duties are fixed by law. The stat- 
utory provisions are sufficiently liberal and general in their 
application to guarantee to the board the right and privi- 
lege of adopting sound and recognized principles of admin- 
istration. To that end the board recognizes the president 
_ of the college as the chief executive officer of the board and 
the executive head of the college. The board delegates to 
the president a wide range of authority in the organization, 
administration, instruction, and general.control of the col- 
lege, and holds him responsible for efficient results. ‘As the 
official representative of the board, he carries out the orders 
of that body ; and as its chief executive officer, he is charged 
with the duty of initiating new policies and making recom- 
mendations to it for the general improvement of the college. 
For the purpose of systematizing the work of the college, 
giving the faculty an opportunity to participate in the ad- 
ministration, profiting by the training and experience of 
experts and group judgments, facilitating the administra- 
tion, and relieving the president of many duties of more or 
less minor importance that he may have more time for 
thinking out the larger problems of the institution, he ap- 
points committees of the faculty and delegates to them such 
functions and powers as he thinks best. These committees 
are responsible to him, and he to his board of control, for 
the work assigned to them. 
The faculty organization includes the president of the fac- 
ulty as the presiding officer of that body, the faculty secre- 
tary, and the standing committees of the faculty. The 
standing committees are: Executive; Appointment ; Student 
Activities; Entrance and Credits; Curriculum; Entertain- 
ment and Lyceum; Social; Library ; Publications; Public Ex- 
ercises ; Registration ; Schedule; Extension and Correspond- 
ence; Scholarships, Loans, and Self-Help; Student Welfare; 
Training School; Buildings and Grounds; Student Publica-

_ tions. In the absence of the president, the dean of the col- 
lege presides over the meetings of the faculty; and in the 
absence of both, the faculty elects one of its own number to 
preside over the meetings. . 
In the appointment of committees to assist in the admin- 
istration of the school, the president recognizes two types of 
committees. One is a special body, clothed with advisory 
powers only, appointed for the purpose of assisting in the 
hearing of requests, gathering data, or making investiga- 
tions on special problems of importance to the college and 
placing at the hands of the president the results of its find- 
ings that he may be better able to render efficient service 
as the executive head of the college. The other is an ad- 
ministrative body, possessing both advisory, administra- 
tive, and legislative powers, with duties and powers dele- 
gated to it by the president and faculty under the same 
recognized principles of administration as are adopted by 
the board of control governing the president in his duties. 
The president and faculty recognize this administrative 
body as the executive head of the particular field of its ac- 
tivities. As the official representative of the president and 
faculty, it carries out their. orders relative to matters in its 
field; and as an executive body of the faculty, it is charged 
with the duties of initiating new policies in its particular 
’ field and making recommendations to the president and fac- 
ulty for the improvement of the conditions in its field. In 
like manner, as the board of control through legislation lays 
down the general policies for the college and delegates to 
the president and faculty the power of setting forth more 
specifically the functions of the school as a whole and of the 
various departments, so the president and faculty, in turn, 
delegate to the various administrative committees the power 
of formulating in detail their specific functions. They adopt 
guiding principles and rules and regulations to govern them- 
selves in their procedure which are not in conflict with the 
principles and enactments of either the president and fac- 
ulty or the board of control. When any matter arises in a 
committee through its regular course of business which is 
of such a nature that the disposition of it will affect the 
general policies of the school, the committee refers it to the 
president or faculty for final action or for further instruc- 
tions. Just as the president of the college is the chief exec- 
utive officer of the board, carrying out the orders of that 
body and initiating new policies for its consideration and 
action, so the chairman of an administrative committee is 
the chief executive officer of the committee, carrying out its
-P-A-G-E-76
Administration of State Teachers Colleges 75 
instructions and proposing from time to time for its. con- 
sideration improvements in its particular field of activity. 
Any matter which is clearly within the function of a stand- 
ing committee may not be-acted upon by the faculty prior 
to a report of the committee. 
In the assignment of faculty members to committee work, 
in as far as practicable, they shall be placed on committees 
for which their training and present work best fit them. 
But a fair and equitable distribution of committee work 
shall be made among the members of the faculty, always 
taking into account their teaching load. 
At its regular monthly meeting before the final meeting 
of the faculty year the faculty shall elect a faculty secre- 
tary to serve during the ensuing year, with such duties as 
are usually assigned to such an officer. At this meeting the 
faculty shall also elect four members to serve on the Execu- 
tive Committee, no two of whom shall be from the same 
department. The president, the dean, and the registrar of 
the college shall be ex officio members and the president ex 
officio chairman of the Executive Committee. At the last 
regular faculty meeting ofthe year the president shall an- 
nounce the standing.committees for the ensuing year. The 
president shall be ex officio member of all committees. 
All standing committees of the faculty are required to hold 
regular monthly meetings and such other meetings as the 
nature of their business may require. At the first meeting 
after their appointment, each committee shall elect one of 
its members secretary, whose duties shall be to keep accu- 
rate records of the proceedings of each meeting and give a 
report of the committee’s actions to the chairman of the 
Executive Committee not later than one week after each 
meeting, and at the last meeting of the faculty year make a 
summary report of its activities during the year. 
. All committees are charged -with the duty of exhaust- 
ing all available sources for materials, standards, and ex- 
pert opinion on matters in their fields of activity as a basis 
for making recommendations to the president or faculty for 
the improvement of their respective departments of activity. 
The data shall be presented in such form as necessary for 
the proper consideration of the problem in hand.
